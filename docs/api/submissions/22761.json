They were a bit loud, which was a bit annoying, but they were kids and kids do that. \n\nI didn't really have a problem with them until they started ding dong ditching us. I don't even know if it could be considered ding-dong ditching because they literally kick the door like they're trying to impersonate the FBI. They hang out in front of our house and do it every 10-20 minutes, keep in mind they kick HARD. My sister was going to call the police in a fit of rage but I told her no, because talking to their parents or calling the police might make it worse. I don't know the kid's situation at home, confronting the parents might make it bad for them. \n\nBut they keep doing it, more often, and harder. There are literally dents and scuffs on the door ( I don't even know how its possible because the kids look 10), and I'm seriously getting annoyed, along with my siblings. They clearly don't see the security camera right in front of the door, so I know their intelligence is lacking, so I'm not gonna yell at them. So I wrote a sign in front of the door, kindly asking them to stop because my siblings work from home and it is extremely distracting. \n\nBut it keeps happening, they rip up the sign and spit on it. So I can't take it anymore, I slip on some socks and slippers and go next door to talk to the parents. The mom said it's not that big of a deal, my door wasn't seriously damaged, and that they were just kids and trying to have fun. And if its that distracting, I should put on some headphones. \n\nBut my last straw is when these kids mess with my package outside the door and shake it and throw the box against the stairs. I snap and decided to take screenshots of all the security footage of them being little menaces. \n\nI make a poster, with their face on it, the damage that they've done to them, and photo evidence of them being menaces. I type out \" Neighbours be on the lookout! Local doorstep gremlins may terrorize your front door!\" which I found funny at the time. I print it out and tape it all over the neighbourhood. My other neighbour finds it hilarious, because those kids have been doing the same to her and she confronted the parent too, and the parent did nothing. \n\nbut today I got a giant knock on the door, and it wasn't the little snot-nosed kids, it was the mom!\n\nshe called me a b-word and an ahole for humiliating her kids, she said that her kids were crying and were now to traumatized to go outside. She yells at me, and drops pieces of the ripped-up poster on my doormat, and walks away. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole, or did those kids have it coming? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: haha I did not expect for this to blow up! \ud83d\ude05 but I am here to clarify things. \n\n1.) why didn\u2019t I call the police in the first place? Well because they couldn\u2019t do much more then give the \u201c Dont do this! Don\u2019t do that!\u201d Talk. The scuffs are dents aren\u2019t even that bad that bad, ugly but maybe a paint pen and some rice will fix it. \n\nAnother reason I didn\u2019t call the police in the first place is because I didn\u2019t know the situation that these children had at home. Calling the police could of enraged the parents and made things bad for the children, I didn\u2019t know if their home life was troubled at the time. \n\nBut as soon as I saw what their mother acted like, I saw a reason to humiliate them \ud83d\ude05 I find that younger kids have a giant fear of being embarrassed, and not coming off as cool as they seem to be. \n\n2.) what did I say to the mother? I just said that it was extremely distracting and disrespectful. I told her that there were dents and scuffs on the door and I showed her the video evidence in the phone. I politely asked for her to talk to her children to tell them that this was effecting us negatively, and you already know the answer! \n\n3.) will I call the police if this happens again? Yes\u2014and no. 911 is reserved for real emergencies, and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more serious problems then some neighborhood brats. Resources are plenty but thin, I don\u2019t want to take them up. If this does happen again, I won\u2019t call 911, I\u2019ll just file a complaint or call a non emergency line.", "created_utc": 1689886760, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155336v/aita_for_making_my_neighbours_kids_cry_because_i/", "score": 3838, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Would she do the same if they (or other kids) did this to her? She's a massive AH and you did very well. \n\nOnly, you should have confronted the parents earlier, and acted sooner. Thinking that things might get worse if the parents confronted the kids, means showing fear, something these hooligans feed on. \n\nPrinting the pics was a brilliant move: do it over again if they keep up their obnoxious behaviour (and yes, call the police: a little lecture from the cops to parents and kids alike can only do them all good). If their parents don't check their ways, others will.", "The fact that you tried to talk to the mother and she was  not receptive to it shows she is glad they are out of her house. This ding dong whatever (I\u2019m British) has escalated to messing/damaging your deliveries. What next?! They wanted attention and you gave it to them courtesy of the notices but now they are traumatised? I don\u2019t think so. Keep a log of every incident and communication with the parent, photos of door and videos and inform the police. It\u2019s not just your house but your neighbour\u2019s house as well.

They had it coming.\n\nTell their mother that if she doesn't want it to happen again, she needs to get a lid on them, pronto.\n\n> these kids mess with my package outside the door and shake it and throw the box against the stairs\n\nAt that point, it's ON.\n\nBTW, many years ago when I was in high school, a couple of kids were playing this game with our front door bell.  There was a ringleader, maybe 12 or so, and two younger ones that he was egging on to actually do the deed.\n\nI went out the back door, walked around the side of the house very quietly, and then lunged out and grabbed the ringleader by the collar, dragged him up to our front door, and knocked.  \n\nMy dad interrogated him for his name, address, parents names, etc. while he sniveled pathetically.  When we were was done, I let him go, and he asked my dad whether he was going to tell their parents.  Dad said \"why don't you just go home and worry about it for a while.\"  I think he was terrified by how calm my dad was.\n\nI don't think dad followed up, but that was the last time we had that problem.", "Ytah for not calling the cops the first time.
