My husband (32M) and I (27F) have a deal that I\u2019m sure lots of couples have- whoever cooks, the other cleans. Generally this works pretty good but my husband is notorious for leaving the biggest mess. I\u2019m talking every single bottle, wrapper, food scrap, left on the counter. Every dish, left where he used it. Every spice left out. Sometimes it takes longer to clean than it takes to make and eat the food just because of how messy he is. \n\nI, on the other hand, am a \u201cclean as you cook\u201d type of person. I use something, I put it away right away. I throw scraps in the garbage when I\u2019m done chopping. I fully prep before starting to cook so that by the time I\u2019m finished and dinner is served, all that\u2019s left are the dishes (which is normally piled beside the sink) and wipe the countertop.\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t expect my husband to do the same. But I\u2019ve had the conversation with him plenty of times where I ask him to at least throw out food scraps and put away bottles/spices he uses, so that all that\u2019s left is dishes and wiping the counters/floors. He agreed but eventually falls back into his old ways.\n\nSo\u2026 I\u2019ve started doing the same to him. Each time it\u2019s my turn to cook, I leave the kitchen in a similar state to how he leaves it: scraps out, every spice and bottle out, dishes left untouched. And he\u2019s made a comment *every single time* about how much of a mess I\u2019ve left him, and how it isn\u2019t fair because he\u2019s going to spend ages cleaning. I\u2019ve used these opportunities to explain that this is what he does to me every time, but he denies it being \u201cthat bad\u201d.\n\nToday, he did the same thing. Except I took photos of the state of the kitchen the last time he cooked. When I showed him this in response to him complaining about the mess, he got defensive. Said that it\u2019s not fair because \u201cthat\u2019s just how he cooks\u201d and that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t like to waste time cleaning when he\u2019s hungry\u201d. I said it\u2019s incredibly unfair that he expects it of me, but won\u2019t do the same. \n\nBut now he\u2019s been making comments about how he doesn\u2019t feel appreciated because of the meals he makes. I\u2019ll admit, he does make some great homemade from-scratch meals. But I do too. And I\u2019d say our cooking skills are about equal, although he might be a little better in some areas. But his comments are making me wonder if I\u2019m nit picking or if I am really am being unfair to him. I get that everybody is different, but it just sucks when I have to clean a gigantic mess and he reaps the benefits of my cleaning. I do feel like I\u2019m a bit of an AH even for saying that. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\n********\n\nEdit to add: since a lot of people are saying it, yes I have offered to change the system to \u201cwhoever cooks, cleans too\u201d but he refuses.

The scales are tipped in his favor. *Of course* he's going to want it his way. He's being manipulative to get his way by making you feel guilty. Does he not appreciate when you cook? Regardless of the mess you've left? This street works both ways. Definitely NTA, but he's being a manipulative one.", "NTA - But an easy solution is just do both cooking and cleaning on your night.

My suggestion would be swap for 1 month or 30 meals each - whoever cooks also cleans. See how long it takes him to get it together when there\u2019s no maid service. FWIW My parents had a modified arrangement that my husband and I have adopted - after dinner, everyone takes their own plate, cup, and utensils to the sink/dishwasher  (even pretty young, this was the expectation). Everyone participates in cleaning up the table area and counters and the person who didn\u2019t cook does the big dishes/cleans small appliances. This wasn\u2019t really done to spite anyone, but my family eats dinner at 8 or 9 a lot of the time and no one wants to be stuck with more than they can realistically handle at that time.

Sometimes it takes a bit to sink in. And cleaning while cooking is a skill that takes some time.\n\nYou need to be on top of the cooking to have the extra time to put things away and you need to understand your cooking to know that you won't need that pot/spoon/spice again. So it's not pure laziness. It's also a lack of technique. \n\nFwiw,  both people clean is also an option. I understand solo cooking.. Cooking is sorta fun for a solo activity.

This is what we did and it stopped the aggro.", "NTA at all", "NTA. And well, you don't need his approval to change the system. Clean after yourself and stop cleaning when he cooks. Eventually he will have to clean his mess.", "I think in your case you need a rule change. 1 person cooks and cleans on alternating days, then the other person cooks & cleans.", "Time to change the rules, if you cook you clean, if its not your night to cook you get the night off..", "NTA I had this issue with my wife too. The difference is that when I talked to her about it, she worked on it and it's a lot better now. We have a \"if you don't cook, you clean up\" rule in my house. We both work and no one wants to have to clean up a gigantic mess after working all day, nor does anyone want to work all day, come home and make dinner for 4 people and then clean it up after.

He doesn\u2019t like the idea of somebody spending their entire downtime after work cooking and cleaning while the other person relaxes\u201d\n\nWell of course he doesn\u2019t like this. It\u2019s what *you* were doing anyway - cleaning as you go and cooking meant that there was very little for him to do after the meal. He got to relax, enjoy a meal he didn\u2019t have to cook, and then all he had to do was wash two dishes, two glasses, and two sets of cutlery afterwards. His load was ridiculously light.\n\nKeep on making a mess. It\u2019s the only way it will sink in, and it\u2019s also the only way you will get the same rest that he does.

I warned him once i would do it, he ignored and after he had to clean sticky keyboard few times he learned.\n\nOP just warn him very clearly ONCE and when it won't change (cause he doesn't care about upsetting you) start dumping all the food scraps from the counter in his gaming system. When he complains just tell since he doesn't respects you or care about you why should you?", "NTA. My partner and I have the same system and it used to cause some arguments because of the exact same reason. I spent my life in industrial kitchens where I had people whose job it was to clean up after me and unfortunately that stuck and just like your husband, I don't want to have bother with putting away every single item as I go. Our solution (proposed by me) was that I will continue to cook that way but once we are done eating I will clean up any ingredients and possible food waste that was still around and at least get the dishes into a more organised chaos. This has worked, especially considering I by far do the majority of the cooking in our home and I don't want my SO feeling like a maid when she's at home.", "NTA.\n\nWow this sub has really made me further validate what a gem of a husband I have.\n\nI really enjoy cooking and my husband ALWAYS without fail offers to clean up while I cook. Sometimes I say yes other times I say I'll clean as I cook myself because I enjoy being in the kitchen alone (or it's a few things that need cleaning and it's pointless having him pause what his doing on his down time to clean up small things).\n\nHell, sometimes we'll even cook AND do dishes when it's our turn because it's not a bother. I can't imagine having to deal with this issue with an unreasonable man that trashes the place while cooking, but then also says it's unfair when you do the same because \"it's just how I cook.\"", "NTA. You are never the asshole for standing up for yourself when your partner is being disrespectful to you in some way. In this case, he refuses to pick up after himself which leaves a gigantic mess for you to clean up, but has a problem with it when you do it - he has double standards and expects something of you that he isn\u2019t willing to do himself. \n\nAnd let\u2019s be clear - the way he keeps changing the narrative whenever you prove his previous point wrong (first it was \u201cI don\u2019t leave it as messy as you!\u201d and then when you showed him he actually does, it\u2019s \u201cbut that\u2019s just how I cook!\u201d) shows that he knows exactly what he\u2019s doing and is going to try whatever line he can throw at you to ensure he continues having to clean as little as possible, both on his cooking nights and yours.", "NTA\n\nI'm exactly like you when I clean as I cook.  My late husband was exactly like your husband.  One way I could do was I clean while he cooked, when he's done with spice, I put it away right away.  So forth.  Sure it annoyed the hell out of him yet he appreciated seeing clean kitchen except for pile of dishes, LOL.  Most men are like that, not all.", "NTA. look how the goalposts moved from its not the same, to im better/ and that's how i cook", "NTA", "NTA\n  \nMaybe start timing yourself?\n  \nOn nights that your husband cooks, time howblong it takes you to clean. On nights you cook, time how long it takes your husband to clean.\n  \n\"Dear Husband, you said it's not fair that the person who cooks also cleans and uses their entire downtime to do work, but you spent an hour cooking while I spent 1.5 hours cleaning each night you cooked this week. Meanwhile I spent an hour cooking and you only spent half an hour cleaning when it was my turn to cook. Is that fair? Or are you just a faster cleaner? If you are, it's probably better if you do all the cleaning and I do all the cooking from now on.\"", "Big NTA. But your husband is. My partner and I have a similar system except he is a much better cook so he cooks 95% of the time. He is also a messy cook and I am a clean as you go person. It took one conversation of me saying that it was really overwhelming to me to clean up a trashed kitchen every night for him to change. He is still messier, but he is definitely more conscious of how many dishes he is using and after we finish eating he goes through and gets all the food waste thrown out and puts stuff away.", "NTA - he doesn\u2019t like the current system because he does not like cleaning up your mess- he just wants you to clean up his", "NTA - Wooooow. This is so selfish. Especially continuing to throw a fit after being shown picture evidence. I hope he is not this selfish in other aspects of your life\u2026.", "Just cook and clean together, with a glass of wine, and a conversation.

This reeks of immaturity and you could have easily give or taken a little bit.", "I have ADHD and this is EXACTLY how I cook. I make so many dishes dirty to make completely simple things and then I get overwhelmed by the mess + plus being hungry makes me unable to think straight / function. My mom also gets upset by things (she is the clean while you cook type) but she cannot understand that that's impossible for me. If I even try I WILL burn something. Check if your husband has ADHD and if yes, adjust accordingly. I'm not gonna give judgment because this is a crucial info we're missing.", "ESH. Take it from someone who tried similar tactics in my relationship, it doesn't work. You want him to see the mess, realize how he has been doing it too, see the error of his ways and hug you while promising to never do it again. In reality stuff like this will just turn into a spite contest which, if left unchecked, will eventually end your relationship.\n\nYou need to talk to him, but not at the moment it's happened. Discuss it at a different time when everyone is calm. Don't start with accusations and anger, that will just immediately make him defensive, just talk about how the mess makes you feel. If he cares in any way about you, he won't brush it off. \n\nChances are he's not doing it on purpose, perceptions on such things can really differ. Some things are a big deal for one person and completely unimportant to others. Maybe there's things you do that annoy him too. The trick in a relationship is to find a balance in this.\n\nAnd maybe he really is an asshole who doesn't give a shit about how you feel. In that case, at least you know where you stand and can act accordingly. Good luck.", "Yeah, exactly.  OP is NTA in this situation.  Husband sounds like a PITA and an AH in general; I\u2019m struggling to see why she\u2019s married to him in the first place.  I hope he at least has other good qualities.", "My mother had a great system for cleaning: \n\n1) If she cooked we had to clean because she already did her part of the work\n\n2) If we cooked we had to clean because we were the ones to mess up the kitchen\n\nOh, how it sucked to be a kid sometimes :)", "Sorry but OP suggested that, and husband didn't to do that.", "Exactly what I was gonna say.  I always clean while I cook, so by the time diner is done, there are only a couple dishes left to do anyways", "This resonates with me so much!! I have the same sort of specimen, great cook, very passionate, but kitchen looking like we had some sort of ork fight going on in there for an hour. And often, and with passion, on the day the kitchen was cleaned. \nCheddar cheese stuck in the fridge's hinge? Yup. \nKitten accidentally fed with coffee beans because the glasses were switches? I've seen it (no worries he didn't actually eat any) \n30min hunt for the pepper because it somehow was hidden behind the espresso machine? No problem, we can deliver.\nAnd yes. Tomato sauce. Everywhere. \nWe've had a friend over the other week and she came out of the kitchen saying \"now I know what you mean\" in a stunned voice. \ud83e\udd2a", "That us not an excuse.

He can enjoy cleaning the same level of mess", "Op has already done all of the above multiple times and he refused each time. Then he can learn by doing the same thing each and every time.", ">But then I thought maybe I\u2019m being petty or thinking he\u2019s being more devious than he intends.\n\nJust because he's not manipulating you consciously, doesn't mean he's not manipulating you. His behaviour here is all about making it as big a pain in the ass as possible for you to hold him accountable, so you don't do it as much. It's not okay, and you should absolutely be calling him out on it. If he's not doing it deliberately, he'll take your feedback onboard and start working on modifying his behaviour. If he doesn't... well, that'll tell you soemthing.", ">now he\u2019s been making comments about how he doesn\u2019t feel appreciated because of the meals he makes.\n\nWhat he really means when he says this is \"You should be thankful that I'm not as bad as other men.\"\n\nBecause he's saying that you should be giving him extra appreciation -- as if he's *doing you a favor* \\-- **just for doing his job**.", "Maybe suggest a new deal: Whoever doesn't cook, does the dishes. So in that way the only thing you will have to do when he cooks, is doing the dishes and the same with him when you cooks. That way it is your own responsibility to clean up the mess you make when you cook dinner.\n\nEither way in this situation NTA, but this could be a curious compromise - because then his mess becomes his own responsibility. If he says no to this, you will know that the only thing he wants is for you to clean after him.", "My husband makes a gigantic mess when cooking and I am the clean as you go type as well.  What ended up working for us is that we both are in there together at the same time.  So if he is cooking, I\u2019m washing dishes as he cooks.  Putting things away, etc so by the end there isn\u2019t much left.  A lot of the time when I\u2019m cooking and he is in there with me I gradually end up passing things off to him, like - hey can you put this away, or stir that, etc ,..\n\nIt\u2019s a win win for us because we get to hang out and chat, and by the time dinner is done each night we are both done.  Then we both go tidy the kitchen together. \n\nHave you tried something like this ?", "Pictures or not, I'd wager he has always known *exactly* what variety of a mess he leaves.\n\nHe simply doesn't care that it's more work for you. He is more than capable of minimizing the mess he creates in order to claim back the time he looses should he self-clean it after one of his own cooking nights, but why would he when he's trained you into doing that?\n\nHe's basically telling you I'm not willing to multitask even if it saves you the trouble.", "Why don't you just stop cooking for him? Treat him like the inconsiderate roommate he's being. You cook for yourself, you eat, you clean up after himself. How he gets his dinner, what of when he eats becomes his concern.\n\nThis continues until he wants to start treating you like his wife, someone who deserves a husband who cooks & cleans as he goes.", "He wants to (bake) his cake and eat it too! (Dutch saying)\n\nMy parents had this issue, in the end if you cannot be a respectful cook the only fair way is to clean your own messes up. Your husband sounds like a lazy cook - you should not be penalised for his cooking style. Don\u2019t ask him; give him a choice - Be a respectful cook or clean up your own mess.

Clean up when you cook and leave it at that.\n\nBy the way, I always clean up when I cook.  Always.  I refuse to let someone clean my mess.  Your post is one of the reasons why.", "He likes the current system because it's less work for him lol", "He likes this system better because he gets to do less work.", "Then maybe slightly change the rule - the 'cleaner' only washes dishes and wipes down the tops.  If the chef has left any other mess, they need to go back out after the meal and clean that up before the cleaner starts their task?", "How about changing it to whoever doesn't cook is responsible for washing dishes and floors? If the rest is the cook's responsibility it will encourage him to clean as he goes.", "Clean while you cook, it is so simple.", "He doesn't like that set up because the current setup benefits him.  Tell him he has two options, he can either start leaving a reasonable mess and you can keep your current agreement or you can switch to a new one, but how things are currently working is untenable and he needs to know that and that you won't put up with it.  He is taking advantage of your kindness here.", "He doesn't want that cause it means he has to clean up his gigantic mess", "Why does only he get to choose the way things are done?", "This is now a problem that no longer requires his buy in to fix, change it to the person who cooks also cleans, the end.

Way less fights since we started doing this lol", "I feel strangely involved, because my girlfriend and I have the same dynamic going on. I am tempted to leave more of a mess while I cook, but my OCD is not helping.\n\nWhat I have found useful sometimes is to try and re-negotiate other chores (e.g. Ok, I will clean the mountain of dishes but you go out and throw the trash/ feed the cats).", "Option 4: you only clean the dishes and the counters. The one that cooks is responsible for food scraps and putting away supplies.", "You definitely shouldn't keep cleaning up the bigger messes if he isn't. it really seems like he is using a type of weaponized incompetence by saying it is just how he cooks and he doesn't have the patience to clean a little as he goes when he is hungry. He has just always assumed he can get away with it. \n\nI see a fourth option though I suspect he would take advantage, and that would be to continue to leave the mess when you cook since he does but all cleanup is shared as a team post meal regardless of who cooks. \nI just always think not cleaning as you go just makes cleanup more daunting overall but if cleanup is always shared each night maybe it will give him less room to complain he should have special treatment which is essentially what he wants.\nI don't see how making cleanup amount/time more equal somehow takes away from him feeling appreciated for cooking. That just seems manipulative.", "It also makes being main chef more fun", "I don\u2019t know if it would ever get easier. Every time I cook I leave an absolute disaster! I don\u2019t know why, but clean as you go is impossible for me. I clean up my own mess when I\u2019m done though! I can\u2019t imagine leaving a giant mess like that for someone else to clean.", "He absolutely knows. It\u2019s a control issue.", "I love this idea!! I did something similar to my ex about his drinking. Kept a note daily on the calendar, in code so he didn't know....not that he noticed or asked lol....and for 3 months I didn't say a word, just kept notes. After the 3 months I added it all up (beer and shots) and wrote him a letter from his liver with the numbers to prove my point. Asked if he wanted to be alive to see his kids graduate. It worked! He cut back major and, we've been split for 12 years but he's completely sober now.", "Same, I'm just not a good enough cook to take my eye off the food for 5 minutes. I'll do simple stuff like arrange the spices I'm done with on the counter under the spice rack so it's faster for me later, but I can't have a spotless kitchen by the time the food is cooked."]}
