My husband (32M) and I (27F) have a deal that I\u2019m sure lots of couples have- whoever cooks, the other cleans. Generally this works pretty good but my husband is notorious for leaving the biggest mess. I\u2019m talking every single bottle, wrapper, food scrap, left on the counter. Every dish, left where he used it. Every spice left out. Sometimes it takes longer to clean than it takes to make and eat the food just because of how messy he is. \n\nI, on the other hand, am a \u201cclean as you cook\u201d type of person. I use something, I put it away right away. I throw scraps in the garbage when I\u2019m done chopping. I fully prep before starting to cook so that by the time I\u2019m finished and dinner is served, all that\u2019s left are the dishes (which is normally piled beside the sink) and wipe the countertop.\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t expect my husband to do the same. But I\u2019ve had the conversation with him plenty of times where I ask him to at least throw out food scraps and put away bottles/spices he uses, so that all that\u2019s left is dishes and wiping the counters/floors. He agreed but eventually falls back into his old ways.\n\nSo\u2026 I\u2019ve started doing the same to him. Each time it\u2019s my turn to cook, I leave the kitchen in a similar state to how he leaves it: scraps out, every spice and bottle out, dishes left untouched. And he\u2019s made a comment *every single time* about how much of a mess I\u2019ve left him, and how it isn\u2019t fair because he\u2019s going to spend ages cleaning. I\u2019ve used these opportunities to explain that this is what he does to me every time, but he denies it being \u201cthat bad\u201d.\n\nToday, he did the same thing. Except I took photos of the state of the kitchen the last time he cooked. When I showed him this in response to him complaining about the mess, he got defensive. Said that it\u2019s not fair because \u201cthat\u2019s just how he cooks\u201d and that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t like to waste time cleaning when he\u2019s hungry\u201d. I said it\u2019s incredibly unfair that he expects it of me, but won\u2019t do the same. \n\nBut now he\u2019s been making comments about how he doesn\u2019t feel appreciated because of the meals he makes. I\u2019ll admit, he does make some great homemade from-scratch meals. But I do too. And I\u2019d say our cooking skills are about equal, although he might be a little better in some areas. But his comments are making me wonder if I\u2019m nit picking or if I am really am being unfair to him. I get that everybody is different, but it just sucks when I have to clean a gigantic mess and he reaps the benefits of my cleaning. I do feel like I\u2019m a bit of an AH even for saying that. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\n********\n\nEdit to add: since a lot of people are saying it, yes I have offered to change the system to \u201cwhoever cooks, cleans too\u201d but he refuses.

The scales are tipped in his favor. *Of course* he's going to want it his way. He's being manipulative to get his way by making you feel guilty. Does he not appreciate when you cook? Regardless of the mess you've left? This street works both ways. Definitely NTA, but he's being a manipulative one.", "NTA - But an easy solution is just do both cooking and cleaning on your night.

My suggestion would be swap for 1 month or 30 meals each - whoever cooks also cleans. See how long it takes him to get it together when there\u2019s no maid service. FWIW My parents had a modified arrangement that my husband and I have adopted - after dinner, everyone takes their own plate, cup, and utensils to the sink/dishwasher  (even pretty young, this was the expectation). Everyone participates in cleaning up the table area and counters and the person who didn\u2019t cook does the big dishes/cleans small appliances. This wasn\u2019t really done to spite anyone, but my family eats dinner at 8 or 9 a lot of the time and no one wants to be stuck with more than they can realistically handle at that time.

Sometimes it takes a bit to sink in. And cleaning while cooking is a skill that takes some time.\n\nYou need to be on top of the cooking to have the extra time to put things away and you need to understand your cooking to know that you won't need that pot/spoon/spice again. So it's not pure laziness. It's also a lack of technique. \n\nFwiw,  both people clean is also an option. I understand solo cooking.. Cooking is sorta fun for a solo activity.

This is what we did and it stopped the aggro.", "NTA at all", "NTA. And well, you don't need his approval to change the system. Clean after yourself and stop cleaning when he cooks. Eventually he will have to clean his mess.", "I think in your case you need a rule change. 1 person cooks and cleans on alternating days, then the other person cooks & cleans.", "Time to change the rules, if you cook you clean, if its not your night to cook you get the night off..", "NTA I had this issue with my wife too. The difference is that when I talked to her about it, she worked on it and it's a lot better now. We have a \"if you don't cook, you clean up\" rule in my house. We both work and no one wants to have to clean up a gigantic mess after working all day, nor does anyone want to work all day, come home and make dinner for 4 people and then clean it up after.

Ideally yes you want to offer and agree on as many things as possible in a marriage and don't want to be dictating things. \n\nIn this case though you're doing all the offering of compromises and he is doing none. \n\nSo, instead of asking, just tell the three options that are available (as someone else wrote out) - 'This current system isn't fair. Here are the choices: x, y, and z. You can choose out of those which you prefer. We're either both considerate of each other or we're not, or we get one night one one night off with the dinner and cleaning the kitchen. Let me know what you choose.'\n\nI'm also speaking as a slightly reformed messy cooker - I realised that while rice or pasta is boiling or while something is in the oven it's not so hard to throw away scraps or put ingredients back away. \n\nIf you want to be really generous, you could offer to teach him how to clear up as you go in a way that doesn't take extra time, in case it's a case of his brain having a hard time conceptualising it (that can be me sometime) - but that's you offering extra help definitely not something that is required.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ll have to change your rules to each person cleaning up after themselves.", "NTA at all!!! My husband is the same altho doesn't sound quite as messy but it's so annoying.", "I had the same story with my husband... he's lovely otherwise, but he leaves a mess when he cooks while I clean while I go. We've now switched to the \"you cook-you clean\" method and we alternate nights. He sort of saw the point on why I found it unfair. Although most of the nights I end up helping with the cleaning anyway, just because i can't stand the mess...", "NTA. Show him this thread maybe? Maybe go to a counselor? There is no explanation for how what he does is ok.", "NTA\n\nBut honestly, sounds like you guys need counseling. Like the way you two were trying to resolve. This conflict is not healthy. Never tomorrow articles that discuss how it\u2019s not just the glass not put in the sink. Overtime resentment, build it and not resentment spills over into other aspect beyond kitchen problems. Some articles even discussed how to respect issue.\n\nAm I saying this is gonna blow up your marriage know what kind of almost like a gateway drug. And it\u2019s not the fact that he doesn\u2019t clean up after himself alone. The fact that you\u2019re having trouble communicating and it sounds like you need help.\n\nThe fact that you stayed in several comments he\u2019s refusing to cook and clean his own mess. Yeah that\u2019s a problem. It seems like he has some deep soul-searching to do. He wants his  cake and eat it too and this is not how it\u2019s gonna work.", "ESH - He's terrible at cleaning, you're being petty trying to \"teach him a lesson\" and neither one of you seems to appreciate the things you each do in the kitchen.", "It seems like the reason you are leaving the mess is spite and if it is spite or petty revenge then yes YTA. You need to work out a new arrangement. I cook the dinner I\u2019ll clean up and do the dishes tonight you cook you clean up and do the dishes tomorrow. You know? I\u2019m like you and clean as I go and it does totally suck that you have a disproportionate amount of work to do after your hubby cooks but you need to work out a new arrangement or accept that he\u2019s a slob and that\u2019s the deal you made don\u2019t be petty or spiteful or you will only create an issue on top of an issue. Now you both have a big mess to clean up so instead of making your situation any better you only made his worse.", "See, this is kind of what I was thinking for a while too and still do. Of course he doesn\u2019t wanna clean lol. I leave a small mess, and he gets to spend 20 mins destroying the kitchen while he speed cooks. It\u2019s like he\u2019s optimizing how much time he gets to relax after work and I\u2019m throwing a wrench in his plan by asking him to do more. But then I thought maybe I\u2019m being petty or thinking he\u2019s being more devious than he intends. I\u2019m not sure, but either way I\u2019m glad someone pointed this out because I felt bad for how I was thinking.", "I didn\u2019t think to add it, but I\u2019ve offered him this as well! He refuses and says he likes the current system better because then it doesn\u2019t feel like one person is spending their entire downtime cooking or cleaning, which I get it. But I\u2019d opt for this system if he was willing!", "Yes that\u2019s what we do too because my husband always makes a mess when he cooks whereas I leave the kitchen tidy.", "It wasn\u2019t my plan for it to get to that point, but it did feel validating to have proof. He always denied it when I\u2019d point it out otherwise.", "Was going to say exactly this, perfect solution.\nNTA", "This. This is the boundary. Rather than trying to change him, let him fully own his own side of the street.\n\nI\u2019d add an appendix to the rule: you cook, you clean, and if the mess is still there the next day, you cook again. I suspect that once he\u2019s confronted with having to clean his own mess he may try some weaponized incompetence or procrastinating to get you to do it for him anyways. DONT GIVE IN, COMRADE. If he leaves it a pigpen he\u2019s on kitchen duty again so you\u2019re not cooking out of his squalor", "YES! Dishes can become a huge issue in a relationship as it clearly shows an imbalance in effort \ud83d\ude2d", "Yeah, we do the solo cooking and both clean routine and works well for us.\n\nI procrastinate and hate doing the kitchen. We just throw on music and clean together and find it gets done quicker and we find it enjoyable part of our evening.", "I replied in another comment already but for the record I\u2019d opt for this if he was willing. He just doesn\u2019t like the idea of one person spending the whole time after work cooking and cleaning. Which again I don\u2019t mind either way, but he refuses to switch to this system.

Do you both get the same amount of down time?", "> It\u2019s like he\u2019s optimizing how much time he gets to relax after work and I\u2019m throwing a wrench in his plan by asking him to do more.\n\nYou got it! Speed cook (20 min), clean up (20 min when you clean as you go). Then that gives him more time to do what he wants. While you, have to spend a lot longer because of what he's left in the kitchen for you to clean up. He's essentially throwing you under the bus with no regard for your time to get in an out because he'd rather be doing XYZ instead. He's being selfish and only thinking about him. \n\nA marriage is a team effort. You two fighting on the same side against the world. He's not being considerate, he's not fighting fair, and this battle is skewed with you taking more hits while he's standing back. For the 10 extra minutes of his time spent cleaning up here and there while he cooks, he's essentially saying to you, \"I'm putting in extra effort because I care about you, and want to give you as little as possible so you too can enjoy the rest of your night and not having to spend the extra 20 minutes cleaning up after me.\" It's about perspective. And that's not even touching the manipulation aspect of it either. How you're thinking is definitely correct.", "Seems like it's time to change the rule to whoever cooks cleans. So when he makes dinner he does all the clean up and when you cook you do all the clean up.\n\nBut I have a feeling even that won't get him to tidy up and clean to a shared standard.", "He likes the current system cos you don\u2019t leave as many dishes for him to clean\u2026 He made that pretty clear, considering he\u2019s not keen to clean up the amount of mess he makes. He\u2019s being petty so tell him too bad you\u2019re both going to trial it. It\u2019s a fairer system anyways.", "I think you need to present him with three options:\n\n1.) He cleans on nights he cooks and vice versa\n\n2.) You keep the current system, but he has to clean as he goes. You reserve the right to refuse to clean if he leaves the kitchen too messy. You'll still wipe down the counters and stuff but not until he throws away his scraps, puts the bottles away, etc.\n\n3.) You keep the current system, but you are not going to bother to clean as you go anymore since he doesn't.", "So fucking what if he doesn't like it, tough tiddies mate! You don't need his permission lol", "He doesn\u2019t get to have every option imaginable available to him.  Hold your ground on this one, his attitude is super disrespectful to you and your time", "He likes the current system because he's not doing nearly the same amount of work you do!", "I'd take pictures of every single mess, yours and his, and make them into a slideshow. But take my advice with a grain of salt, lol. Part of why I'm not married is a refusal to endure that type of nonsense and I definitely take it too far", "I\u2019ve honestly had this worry too, that he\u2019d just neglect it until I eventually do some if not all of it. I don\u2019t like leaving the kitchen messy overnight and generally he doesn\u2019t either but he\u2019d do this on a \u201clazy day\u201d and would probably fall into a habit of leaving it like that more often. I like the idea of \u201cyou cook and clean, but if you don\u2019t clean you cook again and clean it all\u201d. I doubt he would go for it though.. lol", "That's true.\nIt works for household chores as well. 15 minutes by a timer of everyone in the house cleaning can put a helluva debt in a mess. Especially with kids", "Pity he doesn\u2019t like the idea. You don\u2019t like cleaning up after his unholy messes. He doesn\u2019t get unlimited veto power.", "Sounds like he REALLY just doesn't want to clean his own mess.", "This sounds exactly like my husband and me. Speaking from experience, this us the only thing that worked. You cook, you clean. That way if he wants to go and cook an extravagant meal and use every pot and pan in the kitchen, fine - he's going to have to clean it. On nights he doesn't feel like cleaning he can cook something simple.", "I say this with much love, but why is it \"if he was willing\"? If he is not willing to deal with his own mess, and for you to do the same, what does that say? \n\nThat is a mostly rhetorical question, as we know that he knows he's getting the better deal with the current situation. \n\nRight now, he knows you will eventually give in and do it for him. This is what he is banking on. I understand that, and have been through it before. \n\nBut, you are not happy with the current situation, so something needs to change.\n\nGive him the options u/FreshwaterOctopus offered, except for number 3. If he doesn't accept either of them, there is another decision-making path that you can go down. What that is, is up to you.  \n\nMaintaining boundaries is hard to start with, but unless you want this resentment to build even further, now is the time to start saying no to this.", "How different are yalls schedules? Is it possible to cook together (while still rotating who cooks)? One person still does the cooking while the other assists & gets a headstart on cleaning?\n\nMeal planning (if yall don't already) &/or prep could possibly help as well if you have the space to store it (prechopping & storing things like mushrooms, onions, peppers, garlic, etc. & maybe even prepping some meats). Even that little bit helps me [personally] because I've wasted too much food in the past skipping meals when I just wanna EAT, but the steps after a long day . . . T_T", "Push it back on him. Just because he\u2019s not willing to change the system doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s the way it has to be. Your opinion has equal weight in this conversation. Tell him that it\u2019s going to change to same person cooking and cleaning each night or you\u2019ll end up being responsible for your own selves and he\u2019ll have to both cook and clean for himself every single night.", "The petty isn't so much for taking pictures but for acting like him, bringing herself down to his level, and loosing the high road for taking better care of the kitchen.", "I mean I guess not even twenty. More like 5 minutes if he is clever with his time. Onions saut\u00e9ing? Throw out the scraps. Veggies getting steamed? Put away the herbs and spices. Pile the dishes next to the sink while the oven is heating up.\n\nOn the other hand, if the mess keeps growing, that will just make cleaning up harder. When one has to fish out bottles and jars and whatnot from under a chopping desk that is covered in dried mush that now has to be scraped off of it instead of one clean sweep, dishes that have to soak because of again, stuff drying onto the coating...\n\nHe is getting like 5-7 extra (that costs 15+ for OP) minutes to do what he wants and being, let's be honest, extremely rude to his wife who does clean as she goes. Especially since he made it clear that his downtime matters, hers does not. That's rather childish.", "A trial run would show him firsthand just how much of a mess he actually leaves too", "I like this. That\u2019s basically the only 3 options left, because I\u2019m definitely not going to keep cleaning up a giant mess or spend all my time cleaning after I cook to make his life easier if he can\u2019t do the same for me. Thanks stranger.", "Right?! Why does he get the final say?? I wouldn\u2019t even ask my partner, I\u2019d just start doing my own dishes.", "This", "SO the high road is her shutting up and doing it until she can convince him to do what he's supposed to?\n\nHow convenient for him.", "She had to do it to demonstrate what was going on because talking to him about it did nothing.", "Could you have a general discussion about chores and consider renegotiation or reallocation across the board? (In case its not clear I don't mean opening up swapping cleaning the kitchen for a different chore. Just being having conversations about maybe swapping other chores in general.\n\nPerhaps a larger shake up of chores would bring him to the negotiation table and you can get some concessions?", "Agree. I would just say I\u2019d do end dishes only. If you clean as you go, then really all that is left is eating/ serving dishes when you cook? Just clean the same things he gets to.  When he complains, just say I left you the stuff I clean when I cook."]}
