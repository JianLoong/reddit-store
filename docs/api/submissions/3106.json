My husband (32M) and I (27F) have a deal that I\u2019m sure lots of couples have- whoever cooks, the other cleans. Generally this works pretty good but my husband is notorious for leaving the biggest mess. I\u2019m talking every single bottle, wrapper, food scrap, left on the counter. Every dish, left where he used it. Every spice left out. Sometimes it takes longer to clean than it takes to make and eat the food just because of how messy he is. \n\nI, on the other hand, am a \u201cclean as you cook\u201d type of person. I use something, I put it away right away. I throw scraps in the garbage when I\u2019m done chopping. I fully prep before starting to cook so that by the time I\u2019m finished and dinner is served, all that\u2019s left are the dishes (which is normally piled beside the sink) and wipe the countertop.\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t expect my husband to do the same. But I\u2019ve had the conversation with him plenty of times where I ask him to at least throw out food scraps and put away bottles/spices he uses, so that all that\u2019s left is dishes and wiping the counters/floors. He agreed but eventually falls back into his old ways.\n\nSo\u2026 I\u2019ve started doing the same to him. Each time it\u2019s my turn to cook, I leave the kitchen in a similar state to how he leaves it: scraps out, every spice and bottle out, dishes left untouched. And he\u2019s made a comment *every single time* about how much of a mess I\u2019ve left him, and how it isn\u2019t fair because he\u2019s going to spend ages cleaning. I\u2019ve used these opportunities to explain that this is what he does to me every time, but he denies it being \u201cthat bad\u201d.\n\nToday, he did the same thing. Except I took photos of the state of the kitchen the last time he cooked. When I showed him this in response to him complaining about the mess, he got defensive. Said that it\u2019s not fair because \u201cthat\u2019s just how he cooks\u201d and that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t like to waste time cleaning when he\u2019s hungry\u201d. I said it\u2019s incredibly unfair that he expects it of me, but won\u2019t do the same. \n\nBut now he\u2019s been making comments about how he doesn\u2019t feel appreciated because of the meals he makes. I\u2019ll admit, he does make some great homemade from-scratch meals. But I do too. And I\u2019d say our cooking skills are about equal, although he might be a little better in some areas. But his comments are making me wonder if I\u2019m nit picking or if I am really am being unfair to him. I get that everybody is different, but it just sucks when I have to clean a gigantic mess and he reaps the benefits of my cleaning. I do feel like I\u2019m a bit of an AH even for saying that. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\n********\n\nEdit to add: since a lot of people are saying it, yes I have offered to change the system to \u201cwhoever cooks, cleans too\u201d but he refuses.

The scales are tipped in his favor. *Of course* he's going to want it his way. He's being manipulative to get his way by making you feel guilty. Does he not appreciate when you cook? Regardless of the mess you've left? This street works both ways. Definitely NTA, but he's being a manipulative one.", "NTA - But an easy solution is just do both cooking and cleaning on your night.

My suggestion would be swap for 1 month or 30 meals each - whoever cooks also cleans. See how long it takes him to get it together when there\u2019s no maid service. FWIW My parents had a modified arrangement that my husband and I have adopted - after dinner, everyone takes their own plate, cup, and utensils to the sink/dishwasher  (even pretty young, this was the expectation). Everyone participates in cleaning up the table area and counters and the person who didn\u2019t cook does the big dishes/cleans small appliances. This wasn\u2019t really done to spite anyone, but my family eats dinner at 8 or 9 a lot of the time and no one wants to be stuck with more than they can realistically handle at that time.

Sometimes it takes a bit to sink in. And cleaning while cooking is a skill that takes some time.\n\nYou need to be on top of the cooking to have the extra time to put things away and you need to understand your cooking to know that you won't need that pot/spoon/spice again. So it's not pure laziness. It's also a lack of technique. \n\nFwiw,  both people clean is also an option. I understand solo cooking.. Cooking is sorta fun for a solo activity.

This is what we did and it stopped the aggro.", "NTA at all", "NTA. And well, you don't need his approval to change the system. Clean after yourself and stop cleaning when he cooks. Eventually he will have to clean his mess.", "I think in your case you need a rule change. 1 person cooks and cleans on alternating days, then the other person cooks & cleans.", "Time to change the rules, if you cook you clean, if its not your night to cook you get the night off..", "NTA I had this issue with my wife too. The difference is that when I talked to her about it, she worked on it and it's a lot better now. We have a \"if you don't cook, you clean up\" rule in my house. We both work and no one wants to have to clean up a gigantic mess after working all day, nor does anyone want to work all day, come home and make dinner for 4 people and then clean it up after.

Done.", "Me and my partner used to have the same set up. I am the messer, it really bothers him for obvious reasons. \n\nWe now just cook and clean and there\u2019s been no arguments since", "He doesn't want to do that bc he knows how long it would take him to clean up. He either changes, you change the system, or he cooks and cleans all the time. What he does to you is unfair, don't be fooled like that.", "Ha. Of course he likes the current system. It massively favours him!", "Ofc he doesn't want to! He knows the difference between your night of cleaning and his night of cleaning.", "You cook / you clean and take turns is a great idea -- it would disincentivize his making a horrible mess when he cooks, and make him think about cleaning up while he's cooking..... which he clearly refuses to do when you're the one cleaning up after him.  You may want to insist on trying it that way for a month -- if nothing else, it may make him more aware of what he's doing.", "Of course he does, he can stick you with his mess and he gets off easy. He's  totally doing it deliberately.  OP you are NTA", "Stop offering alternatives. Every time he leaves the kitchen a horrific mess, you leave the kitchen a horrific mess. If he complains, tell him that he should clean as he cooks and then he won\u2019t have as much to clean up.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t like that system, he can cook all the meals and clean up after them. Dude is trying to get out of cooking and cleaning. No.", "NTA. Don\u2019t ask anymore. Just straight up tell him. He is now responsible for cleaning up after himself when he cooks.", "Since he doesn't want to do something that is fair to everyone, continue to not clean as you cook. I'd wager after a bit he might be willing to try this suggestion.", "Well so what. Tell him you\u2019re implementing the new system and that you expect to start with a clean kitchen on the nights you cook. If the kitchen isn\u2019t clean then you don\u2019t cook. Your husband is acting like a spoiled brat.", "Then keep leaving him a huge mess to clean up. He's the one who doesn't want to compromise.", "I mean it kinda sounds like he\u2019s saying that the only situation he thinks is fair and that he\u2019ll accept is that he gets to leave a giant mess for you to clean up after he cooks, but you have to keep cleaning as you go. Sounds to me like he doesn\u2019t like cleaning and is determined to have you bear the brunt of it. Possibly not consciously, but for sure unconsciously at least.", "Of course he likes the current system, you do everything. Please continue to leave the kitchen the exact same way he does when cooking. NTA", "I mean, you\u2019re doing the lions share of cleaning up anyway, so of course he prefers this way. Another compromise is to say that you\u2019re only going to do the dishes that are in the sink and wiping down counters, that\u2019s it. Not put away spices, clean up scraps, etc. If there are scraps in the way on the counter then you leave them there.", "Tough. If you refuse to clean as you go then you gotta clean up after.", "Comment stealing bot\n  - Original Comment - https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z3cx2w/_/ixl5sl8/?context=1", "We have a similar rule for our children. I cook, they clean. But if they don't, or they do a half-assed job, they take their sibling's shift the next day. And on day three, THEY cook AND clean because I loathe cooking in a dirty kitchen.", "I had a similar one - you cook, you clean, and until that cleaning is done no further cooking occurs. Needed as my husband would never stur food while it cooked, so it would epically bake onto the pan. The solution was initially to leave that to me to deal with, and then when we swapped chores, to \"leave it to soak\". Now that he actually has to sort it before more food occurs, he stirs things.", "Then continue cooking like he does. Hell, I'm so petty, I'd make it worse, on purpose.", "He doesn't seem to like any idea that's not exploiting your labor, so there's that.", "Yeah \"it's something you do\" and he's doing a terrible job doing in (or not doing it)", "Same. I have adhd and I have to clean as I cook or else I will get overwhelmed because I have nowhere to set things down. Obviously if I'm searing something or stirring something I'm not cleaning but I will delay those steps for 10 minutes to reset the kitchen and get the clutter under control. If something is simmering or in the oven I use that time to clean. I just finished making the Thanksgiving turkey and while it rested for carving I scrubbed the counters and the cutting boards, put the dishes on the drying rack away, and swept. Once it was done resting I carved it and put everything in the fridge because my bf is making gumbo with it later. By the time he gets up to take his shift of the cooking it will be fully reset and ready to go. He does the same for me and he's autistic on top of having adhd. So adhd isn't an excuse, and leaving a mess isn't a default for everyone who has it.", ">His behaviour here is all about making it as big a pain in the ass as possible for you to hold him accountable\n\nNailed it. Weaponized incompetence. It\u2019s a form of gaslighting here, where op is being made to feel like her feelings are invalid and blow out of proportion.", "\u201cWe are both in there together\u201d is the top comment!  \n\nIt\u2019s an attitude shift. And it\u2019s quality time together.", "It's bordering on weaponized incompetence. He knows exactly what he's doing and doesn't want to change it. He's being very disrespectful.", "Doing it together is the way!", "She did try to communicate, yet he refuses", "Yes! My husband used to do this too, but was totally willing to make this switch because he genuinely didn\u2019t realize he was doing it and wasn\u2019t being petty. Now he\u2019s WAY better at cleaning as he goes and we have gone back to the original system of whoever doesn\u2019t cook cleans. That\u2019s what happens when the person leaving a big mess is just a bit clueless about it and not being a jerk!", "Another option is taking turns being Head Chef and Chef's Assistant. I am also a messy cook (but I've gotten better because my husband complains, and I care about point of view!). I generally play Head Chef because I do the meal planning. Unless he's had a really rough day, he's with me in the kitchen while I cook. He does some of the food prep, then he cleans around me while I do most of the cooking. Honestly, I think this system has helped me be a cleaner cook because he's modeled the correct behavior for me. I've gotten much better at cleaning as I go, and sometimes his only \"job\" is to keep me company while I cook. Whatever the dish, though, we both have made it a routine to tidy up BEFORE we sit down to eat. Then, we can both relax with our meal. (This only works if you are ok with leaving dirty plates in the sink until the next day, though.)\n\nThis is a routine that works in our relationship. The key, though, is that he has to care about your downtime as much as he cares about his own.", "I think you have one more option. He says he doesn\u2019t want to slow down to clean as he goes when he\u2019s hungry. That\u2019s fine, but after eating, he should go back and put away ingredients and food scraps before you start cleaning. Then the work amount is the same, he can just choose to do it while cooking or after eating.", "Option 3. Is a shame for you because cooking is easier if you have space and order", "Another option, which is what we do because my husband cooks the exact same as your husband and I cook the exact same as you, is the person who cooks also cleans the cooking area/things while the other person cleans the table and the dishes. We are both in there together and get to relax together.  (Sometimes I'll help him cook and clean as he goes too but that depends on what he's making and my energy level) .\n\nHope this helps OP for another option.", "Something we currently do for food scraps and peels is we have a cheap mixing bowl on the counter and while cooking we just toss all the scraps in there and then toss it during clean up. It's been a huge time saver.", "NTA at all, OP. Definitely let him be a disrespectful AH who leaves a complete disaster\u2026 one he can cuss himself for once he\u2019s left to clean it. \n\nWho doesn\u2019t toss scraps or wrappers as they\u2019re being used? Just leaves them out? Do you guys just have endless countertops so that shit doesn\u2019t get in the way? Also\u2026 the scraps thing\u2026 he can clean up your vomit since you\u2019ve had to handle scraps (fucking nasty) immediately after eating. Or maybe shove his face in the nastiest bits of his mess.", "And please, don't think skill with cooking changes anything. If he could cook circles around Gordon Ramsay, and you were an amateur that sometimes burned water, the deal *should* still be the same.\n\nI hope whichever way you go, it works out. But you may have to sit him down and have an honest discussion about how it makes you feel. Hopefully he'll listen.", "Yeah from now on the \u201ccleaner of the night\u201d is ONLY responsible for dishes and wiping down the counter. The cooker is responsible for any other mess they make. They can do it as they cook or they can do it after dinner when the cleaner is doing dishes. Their choice but the cleaner is only doing dishes and wiping down the counter when the mess is cleaned.", "I think setting clear expectations of \"what to clean as you go\" and \"what to leave for later\" will help. Like, in my home, we have to clean as we go because we have pets who will try to get on the counter if we leave scraps behind. So food scraps get thrown away and ingredients are put away too, but dishes and cleaning are left behind.\n\nMaybe make a list like that with him? \"These things are ok to leave, these things must be cleaned as you go.\" Frame it as a \"us vs. the problem\" kind of problem and I think you'll get better results.\n\n(also whatever you two agree to, you need to follow that agreement exactly. Don't do anything extra, ONLY do what you two discuss and decide to do.)", "There are more than three options. I was also a messy cook and it was a huge issue. My husband decided to just do most of the cooking and I cleaned the pots and pans. When we hired our housekeeper and live in nanny, I paid them extra to cook one day a week each. This may not be feasible for many, but if it is, it helped a lot. \n\nMany years later, I now cook and clean up one night a week, he cooks and cleans up one night a week, and we order in or go out for dinner with the kids the other days of the week. Lunches on the weekend are usually left overs or something light and easy to prepare. I don\u2019t worry about weekday lunches, as everyone just buys their lunch. \n\nLife is too short to argue about dinner.

Someone who was also soft on boundaries because I didn't want to sweat the small stuff.... This selfishness, disrespect and his refusal to listen to you unless you provide photographic evidence (which is absolutely asinine to have to do in an adult relationship, the lack of respect for you there is appalling) will show up in a million different ways until it's a really big thing. It's not small stuff. Resentment will build until you are miserable and by letting these things pass without serious discussion and some iron clad boundaries set, you'll have trained him over the course of years to treat you with disregard and solidified his habit of selfishness in your relationship. When the hill is disrespect from your spouse, choose to die on it every single time. Your future happiness depends on it.", "That won\u2019t work for a person like this because he will just claim he is faster at cleaning.", "If he realizes she's doing that, he'll just clean really slowly so that the timing works for him.  If she leaves him a kitchen that only requires wiping counters, cleaning floor and loading the dishwasher -- then that's all she should do after he cooks.", "Isn't that just option 2 reworded?", "Quality time together!", "If it gets to that point and he\u2019s that petty, I\u2019d be rethinking my relationship\u2026", "I\u2019m cooking thanksgiving dinner now and it\u2019s so much easier to clean as you go.

There\u2019s little downtimes. Where you\u2019re waiting for things to heat up, stuff to boil, times between stirs and so forth. Plus longer waits. Such as simmering stew or waiting for a casserole in the oven.\n\nAll those times are times where you can clear counters, rinse utensils, let things soak or toss in the dishwasher.\n\nNot only it\u2019s it less a mess afterwards. It is often much faster to rinse something fresh. Than to allow it to set and adhere.\n\nOne quick tip to make life easier. If you  mixing something which involves melting cheese. Spray the spoon with oil first. It\u2019s way easier to clean the spoon afterwards.", "I'm a clean as you go type.  My wife, however, is \"hard on the kitchen\". Ex: Every single measuring spoon must be used instead of simply rinsing off the one that just measured a tablespoon of water.", "I had to learn to clean as I go from living in small apartments with tiny kitchens, when there's no room for mess, you don't make one.  So you put the waste into the garbage as you go.... because you need to keep using that space, you rinse a pot when you empty it.... because you probably need it for something else, etc.    Try pretending you have a tiny kitchen and see how fast you learn to clean as you go while cooking.", "I'm the same way. I do a homemade spaghetti sauce that if I don't put in the crock pot takes more effort to prep than cook so there is always a huge mess when I'm done. But then I clean up after myself also so it's on me not someone else", "I\u2019m kind of the opposite. It has to be clean before I start cooking; then it\u2019s more soak the dishes as I go.", "I'm the same way, but I clean at the end before eating because I have cats that will go to town on anything food-related left unattended...", "absolutely the fact he refuses who cooks cleans shows he knows. So A - it's because he thinks being a male cooking is already so fab that he deserves a maid, but would never say it aloud but has no troubles showing it over and over again. Or B - this is just the cherry on the cake, and your whole sharing chores is equal on the surface and totally inequal on reality...", "I feel your pain.", "Just put the spices back in the cupboard as you use them. It helps me to remember which ones I've already added!\n\nI also have a bowl of hot soapy water waiting while I cook and I chuck everything in there as I go, to make it easier to wash.\n\nHonestly small things like that can make a huge difference.", "Learning how to do *mise en place* will greatly increase your efficiency in the kitchen, and will make clean up easier too.", "Lol are you talking about OP\u2019s husband or mine? And how did you know everything I was thinking yesterday?! That\u2019s talent!", "I arrange all the spices I haven't used in one spot, and putting them under the spice rack is how I confirm I've used them. But unless I'm simmering stuff for a while I'll still usually wait until the end to put it all away. It's not so much the spices as the other stuff - some goes to the fridge, stuff like giant bags of rice goes to the basement, etc. So I'll usually arrange things to make cleanup easier but not really clean much until the end.", "Oh I definitely prep well, it comes from the same distrust of my ability to do things while stuff is cooking. Until I've done a recipe a few times I won't usually even do stuff like chop vegetables while the onions are frying. Takes me longer to cook but I do as much prep as I can do I'm dumping pre-measured ingredients in at the right time instead of fumbling with bell pepper seeds or whatever while the garlic is burning."]}
