My husband (32M) and I (27F) have a deal that I\u2019m sure lots of couples have- whoever cooks, the other cleans. Generally this works pretty good but my husband is notorious for leaving the biggest mess. I\u2019m talking every single bottle, wrapper, food scrap, left on the counter. Every dish, left where he used it. Every spice left out. Sometimes it takes longer to clean than it takes to make and eat the food just because of how messy he is. \n\nI, on the other hand, am a \u201cclean as you cook\u201d type of person. I use something, I put it away right away. I throw scraps in the garbage when I\u2019m done chopping. I fully prep before starting to cook so that by the time I\u2019m finished and dinner is served, all that\u2019s left are the dishes (which is normally piled beside the sink) and wipe the countertop.\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t expect my husband to do the same. But I\u2019ve had the conversation with him plenty of times where I ask him to at least throw out food scraps and put away bottles/spices he uses, so that all that\u2019s left is dishes and wiping the counters/floors. He agreed but eventually falls back into his old ways.\n\nSo\u2026 I\u2019ve started doing the same to him. Each time it\u2019s my turn to cook, I leave the kitchen in a similar state to how he leaves it: scraps out, every spice and bottle out, dishes left untouched. And he\u2019s made a comment *every single time* about how much of a mess I\u2019ve left him, and how it isn\u2019t fair because he\u2019s going to spend ages cleaning. I\u2019ve used these opportunities to explain that this is what he does to me every time, but he denies it being \u201cthat bad\u201d.\n\nToday, he did the same thing. Except I took photos of the state of the kitchen the last time he cooked. When I showed him this in response to him complaining about the mess, he got defensive. Said that it\u2019s not fair because \u201cthat\u2019s just how he cooks\u201d and that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t like to waste time cleaning when he\u2019s hungry\u201d. I said it\u2019s incredibly unfair that he expects it of me, but won\u2019t do the same. \n\nBut now he\u2019s been making comments about how he doesn\u2019t feel appreciated because of the meals he makes. I\u2019ll admit, he does make some great homemade from-scratch meals. But I do too. And I\u2019d say our cooking skills are about equal, although he might be a little better in some areas. But his comments are making me wonder if I\u2019m nit picking or if I am really am being unfair to him. I get that everybody is different, but it just sucks when I have to clean a gigantic mess and he reaps the benefits of my cleaning. I do feel like I\u2019m a bit of an AH even for saying that. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\n********\n\nEdit to add: since a lot of people are saying it, yes I have offered to change the system to \u201cwhoever cooks, cleans too\u201d but he refuses.

The scales are tipped in his favor. *Of course* he's going to want it his way. He's being manipulative to get his way by making you feel guilty. Does he not appreciate when you cook? Regardless of the mess you've left? This street works both ways. Definitely NTA, but he's being a manipulative one.", "NTA - But an easy solution is just do both cooking and cleaning on your night.

My suggestion would be swap for 1 month or 30 meals each - whoever cooks also cleans. See how long it takes him to get it together when there\u2019s no maid service. FWIW My parents had a modified arrangement that my husband and I have adopted - after dinner, everyone takes their own plate, cup, and utensils to the sink/dishwasher  (even pretty young, this was the expectation). Everyone participates in cleaning up the table area and counters and the person who didn\u2019t cook does the big dishes/cleans small appliances. This wasn\u2019t really done to spite anyone, but my family eats dinner at 8 or 9 a lot of the time and no one wants to be stuck with more than they can realistically handle at that time.

Sometimes it takes a bit to sink in. And cleaning while cooking is a skill that takes some time.\n\nYou need to be on top of the cooking to have the extra time to put things away and you need to understand your cooking to know that you won't need that pot/spoon/spice again. So it's not pure laziness. It's also a lack of technique. \n\nFwiw,  both people clean is also an option. I understand solo cooking.. Cooking is sorta fun for a solo activity.

I love my boyfriend but I feel this sometimes", "NTA, I would just stop cleaning it. If he stops cleaning after you cook then just clean up after yourself since you barely leave a mess", "NTA but change it to whoever cooks also cleans and just take turns.  This is what we did and it stopped the aggro.", "NTA at all", "NTA. And well, you don't need his approval to change the system. Clean after yourself and stop cleaning when he cooks. Eventually he will have to clean his mess.", "I think in your case you need a rule change. 1 person cooks and cleans on alternating days, then the other person cooks & cleans.", "Time to change the rules, if you cook you clean, if its not your night to cook you get the night off..", "NTA I had this issue with my wife too. The difference is that when I talked to her about it, she worked on it and it's a lot better now. We have a \"if you don't cook, you clean up\" rule in my house. We both work and no one wants to have to clean up a gigantic mess after working all day, nor does anyone want to work all day, come home and make dinner for 4 people and then clean it up after.

Because this whole post his actions are all about \"me, me, me\".", "NTA, you've demonstrated the issue more than clearly and he's not listening.  he's not being fair.  Do you have a dishwashing machine?", "NTA. Because of this exact scenario, we have a \u2018you cook, you clean\u2019 rule in our house. You\u2019re still doing the same amount of work but you clean up after yourself. This is equality. His tune will change if he\u2019s constantly cleaning his own messes.", "When I was a kid, my siblings and I each had specific days for specific chores. Sometimes when it was my turn to clean up the kitchen after dinner, the sibling who cooked that day would make a huge mess, knowing they wouldn't have to clean it up. \nWhen I grew up and I my own family, the rule was always if you cook, you clean.\nThere were never any complaints about cleaning the kitchen.\n\nEdited to add NTA.", "NTA at all!

He\u2019s got a little bit of some old-school engrained roles in his head. He thinks because you\u2019re the woman that you should be cleaning and he shouldn\u2019t have to do as much. There\u2019s no way he\u2019ll admit this to you, but that is what is going on. Kind of a male superiority thing. And I never usually think that about people. But in your case it\u2019s very obvious.", "Use the same arguments back that he does with you...that's just how I am, I am too busy to clean it . Then feign innocence.  Say this is how it will go unless he changes. Then stop discussing with him or justifying yourself.  NTA", "NTA - I primarily cook and my wife cleans dishes. She made a few comments about the disaster I leave after making certain meals, and it just became common courtesy to clean while I cooked as to not leave a huge mess.

Don\u2019t let him get away with it.", "No...women are sick of carrying the weight...the why does he think your time is less valuable than his syndrome...this why women are leaving men every damn day.

I see a big difference in time here.\n\nMaybe he needs to hear that too.. Not only the picture.\n\nBut i probably would have done the same.", "How long have you been married?\n\nWhat's he like with other chores or do you do them because he half asses it?\n\nHis excuses are pure bullshit and the \"I don't feel appreciated\" comment is guilt tripping and manipulative. \n\nThis could be the start of weaponized incompetence so you end up doing everything.", "NTA. 2 Suggestions:\n\n1.\t Cook bigger portions for in the fridge/freezer (more downtime less irritation)\n2.\tLet him read this thread", "In my house I do the kitchen regardless of who cooks, because my husband just hates doing dishes.

So maybe get a little creative and find a new way to work the system that both of you are happy with.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is just putting up a frontbof being an equal partner but makes you the default homemaker by minimizing his time and effort to spend on household tasks.

Hownis it fair that you spend more time, because of his actions? \n\nTime is the same for everyone and I have some suspicion that this is not limited to the kitchen. If you sat down and calculated every single thing you did to keep your living standard, are you investing the same amount of time?", "NTA - this sounds exactly like my partner and I \ud83d\ude05 I like to clear the space while cooking so there's not much to clean up afterwards, but whenever he cooks it's like a freaking bomb has exploded. I've accepted it now though, you've got to pick your battles. I quickly clean after we're done eating.", "This.  \nWe ended up doing this when I was at uni and we had your present system... it got so bad it was almost a competition to see who could make the most mess.\nAnd you get a complete evening off that way, too.\nI suspect that if you can get him to trial it, he'll suddenly start to clean as he goes..", "If we won\u2019t agree, then just refuse to do the dishes one night he cooks.", "NTA - I primarily cook and my wife cleans dishes.

You're going to have to put your foot down and he's going to have to put on his big boy pants and stop whining about doing his share.\n\nNTA", "I'm sure he LOVES the current arrangement. Obviously he loves it. He has less cleaning to do with the current arrangement. But his messy habits are wearing you down. He prefers this arrangement because you give him less to clean, doing it the other way means he'll be saddled with cleaning his own messes.", "Actually that suggestion is great. If I were you I'd insist on it. I bet it won't take him long to learn to clean as he cooks! If you notice an improvement after a month or so of consistent clean cooking, then suggest to go back to the original plan. Most couples have this arrangement. The cook doesn't clean the dishes--but that usually only means the dishware and any remaining pots/pans. Not everything used to cook. \n\nDogs can learn new tricks, this one seems worth pushing for.

In all seriousness, this is not that good of an idea, but I'd rather do this than build more resentment towards him.\n\nDoes he listen to how something affects you emotionally? Have you discussed this when it's not around dinner time, be it before or after?\n\nYou're both in an adversarial mindset, because frustration has built up. Maybe wait until you have a day off together, and wait until he's been in a good mood before bringing the subject up. Starting when already in poor moods is an extra obstacle for anyone. Let him know that you don't like standing on opposite sides, with a chasm full of frustration and resentment between you two. Say you don't want it to be you versus him because of a daily chore; you want it to be you *with* him as your ally and confidant, working together against the problem.", "The fourth option would be you always cook and he always cleans. If you are willing to cook that much."]}
