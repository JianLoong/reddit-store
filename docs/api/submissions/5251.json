This is a MAJOR red flag, much more than I think you realize. He's telling you that the relationship with his cousin is more important than you feeling safe and comfortable at YOUR WEDDING.\n\nIt's not enough for her not to attend the wedding. I think you need to reconsider this relationship if he keeps pushing this.", "NTA. I\u2019m over the excuse all bad behavior because they\u2019re family thing.

Weddings are about the couple getting married and celebrating your love with your loved ones, not with your bullies.   \n\n\nI was bullied throughout my childhood and seeing my bullies around town today or at work (I've bumped into several of them!) actually makes me physically nauseous. I'm a grown ass woman and I am still traumatized by what I experienced in high school. So yes while I understand that she's your cousin in law, it's YOUR day. And if you feel like it would make your skin crawl or that you would be uncomfortable or scared she might spread shit or it might bring on negative feelings for you, then don't invite her.   \n\n\nI would hope that by sharing this with your fiance, he would understand.", "NTA. If she was a bully then, she\u2019s probably still one today. Bullies and weddings do not mix well\u2026.. at\u2026.all!", "NTA. I really wish we would call bullying what it really is...emotional abuse. Would you invite an abusive ex to your wedding? I think absolutely not. Personally I wouldn't invite anyone I, or my partner, wouldn't genuinely want to see at my wedding.", "So wait, it\u2019s your cousin? Why should your husband care? Of course, don\u2019t invite them if they are mean. NTA", "NTA no reason to invite them, you be who you want to enjoy with in a small or giant gathering", "NTA.\n\nShe had an intimate wedding without you, you don\u2019t need to invite her.\n\nEspecially if she has not apologized or taken any accountability for bullying you as recently as two years ago. Being married to the same family doesn\u2019t trump bad behavior.", "Honestly, I would take a good long look at this husband-to-be if he doesn't want to listen to you when you say that you don't want your childhood bully to be at your wedding.  If he isn't 100% behind you setting good boundaries then he may not be the guy for you.  He is effectively saying that his family is more important than you.  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA. You\u2019re not obligated shitty people (family or not) to your wedding.", "NTA. Trust your gut here. This should be a special day for you and your future husband and a bully with a history of targeting you and your family shouldn\u2019t get an invite.", "Family can and should be cut out of toxicity. I'll never be nice to family just cause they're family. Do not invite the wife and don't expect the cousin to come. Good riddance.", "NTA. Especially if she's never attempted to apologise.", "NTA. Your wedding should be about you and your fianc\u00e9, and he should be understanding of your need for comfort and safety. I\u2019m so sorry that you were bullied; my son was horrifically bullied in MS and it was traumatic for both of us. I hated seeing his tormentors after a long battle to finally get him into a better setting because I\u2019d felt unable to protect him; he was terrified of running into them for years.  You don\u2019t need that on your wedding day.", "NTA. Tell your fiance he can choose whether to have you or your bully there", "NTA but honestly don't get married until your bf understands just how awfu his cousin and wife are and that he now has to stand up for you. Otherwise I foresee a lifetime of bullying", "They didn\u2019t consider you close enough for a small wedding. You are saying the same thing. You aren\u2019t close enough to them to invite them. It\u2019s ok. You don\u2019t even need a reason. \n\nNTA", "NTA. \nEspecially thinking about how uncomfortable your sister is going to be, who is obviously closer to you than his cousin's wife, to whose wedding you both weren't even invited.

Plus, you\u2019ve got a good reason not to invite her. She bullied you and your sister for years in high school and is still actively bullying your sister now as adults. \n\nI would make this my hill to die on. Your fianc\u00e9 is asking you to invite your bully to your wedding. No.", "NTA. Don't invite her! You will regret it. Also, red flag for your relationship. The fact that your bf don't mind making you being around someone who are/were mean to you says a lot. I wouldn't even have to say to my fianc\u00e9 I didn't want this person around, he would be the first to say she is not welcomed and honestly, he wouldn't even make me go to family gatherings if this person was there. I would do the same without thinking twice. I don't care how close to me the person is, but if them bully my fianc\u00e9 I would make sure to give them a piece of my mind and to never put my fianc\u00e9 in contact with that person again. If your boyfriend don't want to stand up to you not even against the wife of a cousin.... that is something to think about! if once you get married his family decide to walk all over you, he just gonna let them, after all \"we are family, so just take the abuse! <3\" . \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 can pick your side or her's. And dont marry this man if his willing to put a bully above you. Inviting her will be saying that what she did wasn't that bad, that you are spineless and that neither you or your husband care about her actions, so she can continue to bully you and your sister as she pleases.", "NTA honestly, this would be the hill I\u2019m willing to die on. I don\u2019t stand for bullies I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s family or \u201cfriends\u201d  OP is your wedding day, if you don\u2019t want to be in your wedding you do not have to. Because \u201cthey are family\u201d is not an excuse enough to have to deal with people like this.", "NTA  As far as \"but faaamily\"... your sister trumps his cousins wife in the family hierarchy. Neither you not your sister enjoys this woman's company so why would you invite her to your wedding?", "Nta. It\u2019s a cousin. And she\u2019s a bully. She will find a way to ruin your wedding", "NTA. Nope. You shouldn\u2019t pay to have host people at your wedding that aren\u2019t genuinely there to see you happy. But, accept that if you don\u2019t invite your bully, your cousin isn\u2019t likely to attend. That\u2019s OK, given that this woman bullied you up until a year or two ago, and she\u2019s no longer in high school. Ugh.", "NTA.

That day is a reflection of you and your hopes for the life you're building together. Makes perfect sense that you don't want any bad vibes with your high school bully there. And the only reason you escaped 2 years of bullying is because of your health.

No reunions in my future either.", "I cannot tell you how angry I was when my naive ass realised I could have skipped the cap n' gown shtick for HS.  450 people, 4 valedictorian, 6 salutatorians.
