Some people just want to avoid confrontation and i agree he should def not invite them, but he will probably come to the same conclusion when OP talks to him a bit more. Some people dont get the full picture in an instant like we did. We dont know these people so all we know is what OP tells us while he does. If she keeps insisting and stating it is a huge dealbreaker for her (rightly so) he should give in and side with her. \n\nThis sub just likes to shit on people", "Didn\u2019t you know that according to Reddit nobody can possibly talk to somebody and change their mind? And that doing anything wrong even once is punishable by banishment from anything good ever again?", "The information is that he idoesn't respect her", "But also, she is still vicious. She spread the new gossip just only a year ago...", "Info: has she ever apologized?", "Of course not.  One benefit of being an adult is that you don't have to put up with bullies.", "Nta. \n\nNever give time of day to a bully.\n\nBut regardless. You weren't invited to their intimate family wedding, you are under  o obligation to have them at yours. Bully or not, they don't get an automatic invite just by being related.", "NTA and it\u2019s you\u2019re WEDDING. Do not invite the people who don\u2019t bring joy just because they\u2019re \u201cfamily\u201d. Also, y\u2019all weren\u2019t invited to their wedding, so why are you inviting them to yours? I wouldn\u2019t!", "NTA, and absolutely stand your ground here! This is a hill worth dying on, and I think an important test of your relationship. Good luck!", "Why aren't they married yet, did it not seem important? How is his cousins presence at their wedding eight years into their relationship as important as the brides lived experience? Something doesn't add up and the commenter above quickly surmised that were they in the position sunk cost fallacy wouldn't hold them", "Wait why are you marrying that guy? With that little description it's clear that he doesn't respect or value you and I would like more examples of \"putting his family on me\", because it's not the same\"He didn't go to my birthday party work because his sister asked him for help with her car \" to \"A THOUSAND yelled at me because of my health problems I couldn't help him make dinner and then my boyfriend scolded me for making his mother angry\"; analyze your relationship and future family because you could join a toxic and abusive clan", "NTA, stay firm on them not being invited, not just for you, but your sister who I assume will be at the wedding as well.", "NTA, whether your boyfriend realizes it or not he's showing that he's not ready for marriage. Being married means thinking about your partner and their well being. Having that reassurance that y'all have each other's backs. With that being said if your boyfriend still insists on inviting your bully then you should walk away from the relationship. Because how many more times will he sacrifice your happiness and comfort to accommodate other people?", "NTA. She has a lot of life changes and apologizing to do before she earns an invite to anything you host.", "NTA\n\nWhy would you want someone that made you and a loved one miserable to an event celebrating love, one that's supposed to make you happy? Also she spread rumours about your sister while dating/being married to your BFs cousin? How come the \"she's family\" didn't matter then? Besides if you're not close enough for their intimate wedding, they're not close enough for yours.", "NTA\n\nHer bullying of your sister is relatively recent and I would guess, she has not apologised to either of you.  So that's a \"No\".\n\nAlso, you weren't invited to her wedding.\n\nYou wedding is a day for you and your boyfriend - it isn't a day for your boyfriend's cousin and his wife.", "She's never really properly apologized. She might have tried saying a light \"oh sorry about how i was in school\" after she graduated at boyfriend's mom's house at labour day, but i can't remember as it would have been said in passing. I have had several of the catty bullies i had DM me without being followers or friends of each other on SM and have had them be much more sincere than what I might have gotten from her that never even pointed out how she was a bully. Never apologized to my sister either.", "Did she ever apologize for bullying you and your sister? If not then that's definitely enough reason to not invite her.", "Ouch!  Small world stinks sometimes.\n\nNTA.  Once she learns your name, she should know exactly why she isn't getting an invite.  Of course, that will mean cousin not coming either, but I think the fact you guys weren't invited to theirs should ease your conscience a bit.", "Bf is wrong. Being a relative does not give anyone a free pass to YOUR wedding. Insisting that a bully be invited is in itself being bullying!  \n\nNTA I was bullied all through school so I know that the pain remains and I'm 60 years old this year.", "NTA, you weren't invited to theirs.  That's enough, IMO.  If they don't see you as important to their lives they might not even come anyway.   But I wouldn't want to risk the chance of her making a scene at the ceremony or reception, especially if she was still pulling this sherty nonsense only two years ago and hasn't apologized.", "Do not marry your bf. He does not have your back and you will regret it. Also, NTA", "They didn't invite you to their wedding, why would you invite them to yours??? NTA.", "I completely agree his wife is definitely more important I was just pointing out that until the wedding she is not a member of his family and certainly not a member longer than the already married in cousin. For the fianc\u00e9 it\u2019s not really the wife it\u2019s his cousin that matters they have always been related and not inviting the wife means not inviting the cousin."]}
