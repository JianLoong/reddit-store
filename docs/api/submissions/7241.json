My mom won\u2019t be at my wedding, she is declining fast and probably won\u2019t make it another month\n\nSo I want dandelions to be at the wedding to symbolize her. I went to my fianc\u00e9 with this ( she is going most of the planning) and told her that I want some dandelions in her bouquet and on table decorations.\n\nShe made a face and told me those flowers won\u2019t hold up for it. I told her we could get fake ones off Amazon or somewhere. She told me she will not have weeds in all of the wedding photos. I was shocked and we started arguing. ( it got nowhere)\n\nI left to cool off and her MOH called me and told me I was a jerk. That the weed has no place at the wedding and how dare I ask her to walk down with something my mom wanted to do at her wedding.\n\nAITA \n\nEdit: I went back to talk to her, with all of the suggestions. I really like the dandelion on a plate for my mom or the dandelion lights, we were going to have a light wall and it would be easy to switch out, since we give the person the lights we want. \n\nAnyways I asked if she knew MOH called me and she was suprised by that. I also asked if this is my wedding too or should I just be happy not to have a say. She was quiet at that. I then Asked why we can\u2019t compromise somewhere for the dandelions. Why they can\u2019t be anywhere. Well she doesn\u2019t like my mother, I have been spending a lot of time with her recently and she feels neglected. She doesn\u2019t want to be reminded about my mother on what is suppose to be the happiest day of her life.\n\nI don\u2019t know we\u2019re to go from here.", "created_utc": 1673633920, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10b1ep6/aita_for_wanting_my_fianc\u00e9_to_have_dandelion_in/", "score": 10312, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For example, if your mom passes before the wedding (hopefully not), you can have an In Loving Memory card with a dandelion attached or something like that.

That doesn't mean that dandelions aren't beautiful (they support the bees) and that they can't have a place.\n\nMy advice would be to exert control over *your* outfit.

A picture on a table near the gifts or cake display, for example. Or you can reserve a seat that is not used at the table where your siblings and other close family members sit and put her picture there.

I can totally see how a wife could take this as you prioritizing a mother over her (or her plans for the wedding), and that's generally a bit of an AH move.\n\nAt the same time, I assume you've conveyed this strong importance to your wife, correct? Overall this is a silly hill to die on, and if she really can't see the importance of it, then yikes. Compromise is a crucial skill in marriage, and starting off on the wrong foot is a bad look.\n\nIt sounds like some sort of compromise, maybe of a wedding vs. wedding reception, might be the best option. Keep dandelions out of the ceremony, add them for some other part, maybe even the photos, I don't know. But y'all are both gonna have to budge some for this to come through.

That way they aren't in EVERY picture, but you can still honor your mom.\n\nI bet if you talked to the florist or someone on ETSY you could find someone who could do something really creative and it wouldn't just look like weeds at a wedding.", "The definition of a weed is a plant that grows where it is not wanted. I think it would be a beautiful gesture to have some dandelions in the wedding decor, as a gesture to your mother. So sad that she'll not make it in person. On a slightly different note: If you look at a dandelion and forget about your predjudice, it is actually a very pretty flower. Also, it will break through tarmac and grow almost anywhere.

She's probably thrown herself into planning so she has it as a project to absorb her and compensate for what she's feeling so she might be a tad protective of her vision for the wedding - asking her to put something in her bouquet to symbolise the person that she sees as taking you from her would probably have really stuck in her craw (not defending her, just exploring what she may be feeling).\n\nEqually you're trying to deal with ailing parent and all that that comes with (been there, done that, sending you best wishes for the road ahead OP). Your world is upside down right now and you're trying to see a way ahead and figure out how to honour your Mum.

You may want to express those intense feelings of pre-emptive grief by having dandelions everywhere, but equally your wedding is going to be hard enough grief-wise without plastering very bright flowers everywhere to remind you of the person that can't be there. Guests might be a little confused and if your fiancee isn't 100% on board it isn't fair to her. They would be in every photo, every memory of the day that is meant to be about you and your new wife. A subtle homage (dandelion button holes, socks, a candle on a small table with a vase of them and a photo, or a poem reading) to your mum would fulfil the same purpose. There is no way you will go through the day without thinking of her, flowers or no flowers. \n\nA bride's bouquet is exactly that - the bride's. She may do the flower throw to her friends, it forms part of the outfit, and she may have her own ideas of symbolic flowers.

It would be overwhelming. But people seem to think it's more okay bc it's the groom's mom who is being represented? I don't get that at all.\n\nI assume she has met your mom? It's not even like you're honoring someone who passed decades ago that she has never met. The loss will still be very fresh when you marry. How is she unwilling to compromise on this? What does that say to you about the person with whom you're joining lives?

After I proposed, she started planning and thanks to her parents generosity, we were booked at a very classy club/resort with truly beautiful ocean views and some 5 star restaurant food. Unfortunately, my dad had been fighting cancer while we were dating and it accelerated during our engagement. At a certain point it became clear he wasn't going to make it to the wedding date, much less be able to travel for it.\n\nMy wife ended up changing her mind - turns out the location, the ocean view resort, and the fancy food weren't the most important thing. Having our parents at the wedding was more important. Within 2 weeks, she (with lots of help from family and friends of course) put together a backyard ceremony so my dad could attend.\n\nIt was far from the perfect wedding in sense I think your fianc\u00e9 considers it. Her dress was a rush order off Amazon. The food was a catering order from a very average restaurant, served by some friends and family onto paper plates. There was rain in the forecast so we tried to cover the yard as best we could, but her dad ended up under a hole in the cover so his shirt was soaked through by the end of the ceremony. I could probably list a couple dozen other things that were less than ideal. Relative to the resort wedding my wife had spend months planning, it was a certifiable mess. My wife isn't oblivious, she knew this was the opposite of her vision, but we were getting married and she didn't complain about the thousand sacrifices she made so that my dad could attend. It ended up being the most lucid he had been in months, and then he passed away that night. I don't know if I can articulate how grateful I am that my wife embraced the rush wedding, with it's thousand flaws, so that my dad could be there. \n\nI'd say that marriages (or relationships in general) aren't really about how a couple does during the best of times, it's easy to be a couple when things are going according to plan. I'd say you're better off examining a relationship when things don't go according to plan. That's when you see what sacrifices, if any, one party will make for the other.

I think something along the lines of a memorial table, a reserved seat at the ceremony in her memory, or something along those lines would be more appropriate. \n\nMy advice would be to maybe see if you could walk down the aisle with a dandelion bouquet and place it on a reserved seat in your mom\u2019s memory or have some dandelions on a memory table for her.
