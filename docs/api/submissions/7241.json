You can wear one and perhaps she can have a separate bouquet that has the dandelions so you and her can take a picture. This is also a way to make them pretty for the table. For example, if your mom passes before the wedding (hopefully not), you can have an In Loving Memory card with a dandelion attached or something like that. There is room for compromise here if your wife isn't a completely controlling jerk. Also not a great sign that she went and told her mom on you.", "NTA.

That doesn't mean that dandelions aren't beautiful (they support the bees) and that they can't have a place.\n\nMy advice would be to exert control over *your* outfit.

A picture on a table near the gifts or cake display, for example. Or you can reserve a seat that is not used at the table where your siblings and other close family members sit and put her picture there.

I can totally see how a wife could take this as you prioritizing a mother over her (or her plans for the wedding), and that's generally a bit of an AH move.\n\nAt the same time, I assume you've conveyed this strong importance to your wife, correct? Overall this is a silly hill to die on, and if she really can't see the importance of it, then yikes. Compromise is a crucial skill in marriage, and starting off on the wrong foot is a bad look.\n\nIt sounds like some sort of compromise, maybe of a wedding vs. wedding reception, might be the best option. Keep dandelions out of the ceremony, add them for some other part, maybe even the photos, I don't know. But y'all are both gonna have to budge some for this to come through.

I think it would be a beautiful gesture to have some dandelions in the wedding decor, as a gesture to your mother. So sad that she'll not make it in person. On a slightly different note: If you look at a dandelion and forget about your predjudice, it is actually a very pretty flower. Also, it will break through tarmac and grow almost anywhere.

These women are just too much and I thanks parents every day for not raising me like that.", "also like not to soapbox, but the way people use the word \u201caesthetic\u201d when it comes to weddings makes me crazy, because they really mean \u201cconformity\u201d or \u201ccontrol.\u201d a dandelion chain *added* whimsy and beauty and color to your wedding. it *added to* the aesthetics. aesthetics are about delight and pleasure! there is nothing delightful or pleasurable about conformity! \n\nanyway that\u2019s super cute and lovely and i hope the rest of your wedding was equally delightful \u2764\ufe0f", "Agree with this but suggest perhaps get married to someone else...", "Actually, he might want to rethink the bride.", "I\u2019m gonna say maybe OP shouldn\u2019t get married now or at all to this person", "I can't agree with you more. She definitely doesn't sound like a good person. I'd be leary about marrying her. Sounds like his mother is about to pass and I just hope he gets the proper support from his fiance. I kinda doubt that though..", "Plus she sics her MOH on him? She's hideous. NTA, OP!", "Oh my god, yes! Center the entire menu around dandelions!", "The entire plant is edible. I enjoy an occasional cup of dandelion root tea sweetened with honey.", "Yes, exactly! The flowers make excellent tea and the leaves are good on sandwiches with salt and pepper!!", "Wow! They should have a special dandelion wine at the reception too to toast his mom.", "Yes!  Corn is a weed when it's in a soybean field because it's growing out of place.", "I came here to say that!  Thank you!", "I have gained a whole new respect for dandelions to due to this thread, thank you", "Actually, the flowers are used for wine, the root makes a liver detoxifying tonic tea.", "So if she forbids him to wear a dandelion patterned suit, would you still say ESH?", "I wonder how much choosing and planning she did without his input. I'm sorry but if my soon-to-be-husband asked such a small thing from me in honor of his dying mother I'd do what I could to at least compromise. OP's stb bride is having none of that. \n\nOP is NTA, but gf and MOH surely are.", "> But she is not obligated to accept that input.\n\nBy your own logic, HE is not obligated to accept HER input. Checkmate, dandelion-hater.", "Found the fianc\u00e9e!", "Except he's also asking about the table decorations, which she also said no to.", "Then insist on it.  This is your wedding too right?  Just make sure its tasteful and respectful.", "No indeed, if you\u2019re already doing green and yellow. NTA no matter what the color scheme, but that just makes it extra bonkers.", "It even fits the color pallette? I'm a little confused here. Is she always like this? How do you guys normally handle that type of decision?  You tell her something, she gets upset, she goes to cry to her bestie and bestie screams at you? Planning a wedding is stressful, but that's not the most stressful event you guys will face together. If she reacts like this to something like honoring your sick mother, I personally wouldn't want to marry her. Find someone who wants to let you put dandelions in her wedding bouquet because family values are also important to her, and will surprise you with flower girls spreading them everywhere while wearing crowns made of them and then show up herself with her own little crown and have one for you because men can wear dandelion crowns too! (That took a turn. But NTA.)", "Leave her. Yes I\u2019ll keep saying this. Trust me. Leave. Her.", "It was something I considered as well but since mom is getting weaker by the moment and can't attend, I think she'd approve.", "Yes! So many mistake the two as the same. Until it's way too late", "to be FAIAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIR he also asked about table decorations and was unilaterally shut down. \n\nare the tables hers too?\n\nget the fuck out of here with that bs lol", "Why though? If my future husband had an interest in what kind of flowers would be nice in the bouquet, I would love to figure out how to make that work. It's not my wedding, it's our wedding.", "He is fine with no bouquet. She said no to the entirety.", "This. If this was some other matter, like it was his family emblem or a running joke or whatever, then sure. We could have this debate.\n\nBut man\u2019s about to lose his mother and marry knowing she never got to see it. This would help give him a small bit of peace on the day, but she won\u2019t let him have this one bit of decor. Don\u2019t care if he\u2019s been useless this whole time, if his uselessness wasn\u2019t bad enough to call off the wedding then you do this small thing", "Not really", "Yeah, technically, but. If OP's mother isn't a horrific monster, I can't imagine someone refusing even one is the right partner for anyone.", "Oh my god haha. I\u2019m French and obviously knew they\u2019re called \u2018pissenlit\u2019 but never made that connection! The grammar is a bit off if that\u2019s what it means so guessing it\u2019s quite an old word but I can totally see it so thanks for that - TIL! \ud83d\ude02", "They also close indoors and at night, or a lot of them do. But he was suggesting plastic ones, which would work.", "As someone already pointed out, they can also easily stain. Not ideal for someone wearing all white.", "Depending on the time of year -- i.e. anytime except the dead of winter -- dandelions are easily found growing wild. With a few months' notice, any decent gardener could bring a few plants indoors to cultivate for flowers. They may or may not be terribly photogenic if it's November, but I can state from experience (collecting them for late-semester botany class demos) that a single dandelion to be hidden in a more-complex boutonniere would not be hard to come by.", "\"However he didn\u2019t say anything about offering to help plan it so I can only assume he didn\u2019t.\" \n\n The statement \"However he didn\u2019t say anything about offering to help plan it so I can only assume he did\" is just as valid. \n\nHe didn't address planning at all. It's not reasonable to assume anything.", "Either way she insulted his idea and unilaterally banned it and then got her friend to call him up and insult him more. It doesn't matter if he didn't plan a single thing. Who the hell insults a tribute to a dying mother and ropes their friend in to help", "Planning most isn\u2019t all, so it seems as if he is helping, to what extent we do not know.\n\nBut, I can see why he isn\u2019t doing 50/50 with her if this small request sends her flying", "So the solution is she gets to pick all the flowers and vetoes the only one he wants to honour his mother. \nThat's a great start to the marriage. \nWould be interesting to know what would happen if he turns round and decided to change the whole table arrangement plan. \nI bet she wouldn't go along with that.", "Ok, that's fair. I still don't think we have enough info to call OP an asshole for this, though - admittedly this is an assumption, but given her response to OPs request for dandelions to be part of the decor, I don't think it's a leap to think that she's not letting OP be any part of this.\n\nRegardless, whether he's been a part of the planning process or not, I still don't think he's an asshole for the reasonable request to feature dandelions in some way, and I do think she's an asshole for not being willing to consider this/compromise at all.", "Maybe he\u2019s doing less planning because his mom is dying and he\u2019s spending time with her?", "It\u2019s the lettuce and Liz all over again. My money is once again on the plant.", "I\u2019d put that damdelion right in the middle of my red roses to honor my husband\u2019s mother. Wtf?", "You know what? Fair enough. There are a lot of solutions here and it makes me really angry the bride doesn\u2019t care.", "It says at the end that the MOH gave him shit about doing something his mother wanted for his wedding, so she knows and is just sucky", "No one besides the bride/groom any maybe their parents are going to look back on those photos. Who cares if they are perfect? I care more about the people that came to celebrate than the *aesthetic*.", "I\u2019m with you 100%. Who cares if everything is perfect? People aren\u2019t perfect and we love them anyway. I think there\u2019s too much emphasis on weddings being the happiest day of your life. They are stressful, expensive, and time consuming. It\u2019s better to focus on the people you love and the fact that they take time out of their lives to come celebrate with you.", "Amen", "I concur...", "I suspect that if OP wears a dandelion in the buttonhole, the fiance will take it as a personal insult.", "That makes my little dandelion-loving heart smile", "She\u2019s allowed to say no.", "> This is your wedding too\n\nThis, exactly!", "Yes, I think beautiful and a better woman would find this gesture beautiful.", "I was talking about the bouquet, which i why i used the word bouquet. Relax", "Sorry but dandelions don\u2019t look nice in a bouquet. They\u2019re hardly flowers, they stain and don\u2019t stand well in one.", "Indeed. They're also not really great for making decorations with. Like try to find any images for a dandelion bouquet and you're not going to find anything. They're just not well suited to bouquets and decorations. You're much better off finding subtle ways to include their imagery. Custom-made dandelion cufflink, dandelion charms, stuff like that is going to be much easier to work with than the flowers themselves. Especially cuz those things can be in colors other than attention grabbing yellow.", "I don\u2019t see where it says she asked her friend to call up OP.  I\u2019d say friend is TA for sure, as she doesnt get a say in the decor.  It should matter that he isn\u2019t really helping with an extremely stressful, time consuming, and expensive party, but regardless I said she should be more accommodating.  Why does he immediately go for her bouquet instead of something he\u2019ll be wearing as a tribute to his own mother? \n\nOne thing I would say though is that putting it in all of the table decor feels a little strange.  I would not want every table at my wedding decorated as a tribute to my dying mother.  YES there should be a tribute and a space for her maybe with a picture of her if she doesnt make it or have the ceremony streamed to her if she can\u2019t physically be there.  \n\nAs for him, having a dandelion pinned to his lapel would honestly be perfect (imo) as it is close to the heart.  Though maybe a fake one or a pin as dandelions get wilty quite quickly and that would be the opposite of what you would want as a tribute.", "No, that\u2019s not the solution. The solution is that they both pick out flowers if that\u2019s the concern. But both parties have to agree to ALL of the flowers.", "It sounds to me like planning is well underway at this point and it\u2019s likely she\u2019s already chosen flowers/color scheme/decor. So having someone throw a wrench in the plan which is basically \u201ccan we put some seasonal weeds that no florist will have in everything?\u201d Is going to be upsetting even if that other person is also getting married. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m not willing to make that leap. I have seen so many men say \u201cwell she does thr work because she\u2019s the one who cares about it\u201d when it comes to everything from cleaning to wedding planning. It\u2019s his wedding too which is why he should be equally responsible for doing the work.", "He asked for one specific flower in table decorations to honor his mother. ONE. Not several, not a whole bouquet of dandelions, just enough to feel his mothers' presence when HE looks at them. She offered zero. I'm not implying that one person is the bad person here, I'm saying it outright, with my whole chest.", "\ud83d\udc80", "It would actually look really interesting in photos. It would add some personality to the perfection.", "Ah, I missed that little end bit. Then yeah, she\u2019s the AH.", "Especially since, despite knowing the meaning, she consistently refers to them as \u201cweeds\u201d", "Good. I kinda hope she does and she'll deserve it too. It's for his dying mom!!! Her head needs to be rescrewed on. Maybe that will do it lol.", "And he\u2019s allowed to be annoyed with the no. And to reconsider the marriage if the dandelion is more important than he is.", "And he\u2019s allowed to be upset. The wedding is for both of them, not just her. What makes her the asshole is that she\u2019s not even willing to discuss a compromise or other solution. When you\u2019re married, it\u2019s not just about what you want. You also need to consider your partner and not shut them down while refusing to discuss it further", "Is he allowed to say \u201cno, we won\u2019t have any table pieces without dandelions\u201d?", "You don't have to agree with my leap that she's not letting OP have any say in their wedding, that's fair.\n\nBut likewise, I don't have to agree with your leap in assuming all the planning is pretty much done and she's already chosen flowers/color scheme/decor, which the dandelions would clash with, and that's why she's not willing to entertain this dandelion idea.", "Depending on the florist, it\u2019s very likely that it would be a breach of contract to buy faux dandelions and place them in the floral decor.\n\nI mean it\u2019s not impossible by any means but it would certainly add to my stress if my fianc\u00e9 threw this in after things had already been set.\n\nIt seems like maybe a more in depth discussion is needed here, but it\u2019s also possible that his fianc\u00e9e is just shutting him completely down which would be an AH move. But also his expectations need to be realistic - fresh dandelions are not going to work in flower arrangements.", "Look, I 100% agree that the bride is being ridiculous. You can see my original post for that. But I\u2019m not into the business of comparing evils. \n\nBoth parties are trying to push for something that the other party very much does not want. That\u2019s not how a healthy relationship works. A healthy relationship works through discussion, collaboration, and compromise. This requires dialogue and sacrifice from both sides, not just the side with the objectively \u201clesser\u201d request. Only one side sacrificing things is what leads to those unspoken resentment issues that pop up so much here.", "The bride doesn't want dandelions because they're not \"pretty.\" The groom wants dandelions because his mom is dying. He has an actual reason to want dandelions, not just \"I want them.\" She is putting her desire to have pretty flowers at her wedding over her fiance's feelings. She cares more about her \"perfect wedding\" than she does about the actual groom. She is actively barring him from honoring his dying mom at his wedding, which is a horrible thing to do to someone you supposedly love. She is in the wrong 100%.", "I fully agree. And I respect your objectivity, it is necessary. Especially since we have exactly one side of the story. But to judge these posts we have to take them in good faith also and give OP the benefit of the doubt. If his bride is a hard no on the one thing he asked for to honor his mother, its hard to imagine they have a healthy relationship to start with. I cant imagine being anything but honored to help my husband pay tribute to his mom on our wedding day."]}
