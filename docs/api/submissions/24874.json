You can and should use that word when you report him to HR. Don't try to interact with him anymore since he seems to enjoy the attention. Instead, get a witness and whatever receipts you have (emails, texts, social media activity, etc.) and show them to HR. Let them know that he's taken a picture off your social media without your permission and is using it as his phone background. Then he asks about your whereabouts and schedule when you're not at work and has repeatedly asked you to hang out with him outside of work despite you saying no. Sexual harassment is serious and no workplace wants to deal with a lawsuit, so it's beneficial on their part to nip this in the bud right away.", "This is sexual harassment and you need to report it to your boss immediately. You are already potentially messing up your case by waiting to report it for so long. Get your act together and speak to HR right away. And if you are unionized speak to your union rep asap.

This is literally sexual harassment and go to your boss or HR to report his behavior asap. In the meantime also set your Instagram to private and distance yourself away from his.

I would explain the issue surrounding the photograph and have proof if you can. Since he repeatedly asks you, at work, about going hiking together, or when you go hiking, that may at least be enough to get him a talking to. Make sure you tell them that he is making you uncomfortable or that you do not feel safe. Make sure you put the complaint in writing. You should also go to all of your social media, and make it private.", "NTA. He is a creeper and possibly a stalker.

Might be a longshot but better safe than sorry.", "NTA - take it the higher ups.  That is just super creepy.  Yeah it's public domain but when you work with the person in the picture, that crosses a whole new boundary.  This could be harassment and be what gets him either fired or straightened out.

Everyone is saying HR, but you said you work for the post office, so I would start with your union rep. That way you\u2019re talking to someone who, in theory is more oriented towards supporting workers, as opposed to HR, which is there for the organization first and foremost.", "NTA.

His behavior is not normal and creates hostile workplace. Companies have annual trainings for these for a reason.", "Oh yeah... that's creepy.  And I would definitely tell HR that it's making you really uncomfortable.  NTA for escalating this up a level.", "NTA absolutely go to HR.

A male coworker took pictures from a female coworkers social media sites. He took those photos and created a website where he posted them. Idk all of the details, but he got in huge trouble for stalking her. Even after he got in trouble and restraining orders were put in place, she moved far away and got rid of social media. She was at work at the new place and guess who shows up there? The guy who made the website. \n\nTo me, what your coworker is doing is a precursor to a larger stalking issue. You\u2019re not wrong for being upset or wanting to take this to your hire ups.", "NTA that is stalker behaviour.", "NTA. this is very odd behaviour on this part and an HR nightmare waiting to happen. you need to talk to them immediately and document all of this as it\u2019s happening. he is harassing you and if they aren\u2019t willing to handle it then they may be looking at a case on their hands.", "NTA. that\u2019s a violation in privacy and you should get an RO on him", "He is creating a hostile work environment and subjecting you to sexual harassment.

You don't feel safe with a coworker, you need to tell people in your HR department IMMEDIATELY!", "NTA. Write everything down. Comments, date, time, witnesses. Screenshot comments and messages.

The minute someone says \"let's just keep this informal and work it out,\" you are about to get screwed.", "I agree this should be the order of importance. The phone background is iffy. Him repeatedly asking you out is not. So start with that since that is obviously sexual harassment and then tell them about the phone background as backup evidence of harassment.", "This was how I helped take care of a really toxic new hire.  2 weeks in to working at my last job, she had sexually harassed me, was violating confidentiality by talking about private medical information of one particular employee with everyone else except the people above her, and was using slurs on the sales floor.\n\nSent an email to district manager and HR that cited everything she had done to me, with dates, time stamps, where in the store it happened, and who else I knew already knew.  Mostly because I had reported up the chain of command (to supervisor, who brought it up to manager), and my email was a follow up with all the details.\n\nShe was fired 2 days after I and two other employees sent our emails in.  And we forwarded the emails to each other to make damn sure we had copies in case they did nothing - myself and another employee were looking at possibly going in together for an employment lawyer.\n\nBut because we sent the reports in, in *writing*, the company had to do something about it.  Because we had active evidence that it was brought up, and that could have hurt the company something terribly if we did go to a lawyer.  After all, what parent is gonna go shop at a toy store that allowed sexual harassment on the sales floor.", "Thank you for saying it more clearly than I did.", "Hell naw dog. Having a picture of someone you are just acquainted with on your phone is weird as fuck unless you took it. And then to make it the background or lockscreen.
