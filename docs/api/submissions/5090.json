We recently have gotten custody of Tyler (m10) whose parents were our close friends and passed away a year ago.\n\nOriginally Tyler had been placed in a foster home that was pretty terrible. They kept three very large aggressive dogs and Tyler was removed and finally placed with us after an incident with on of the dogs that sent Tyler to the hospital. Now Tyler is terrified of dogs, can't be near them at all he has panic attacks and cries.\n\nA year and a half ago we got a dog for our son. He is very friendly but he is also the kind of big dog that terrifies Tyler. So we told our children that the dog would be kept in a specific part of the house and not be left alone with Tyler. He is already not allowed upstairs where the bedrooms are and he has a big yard he loves playing in so we thought it would be a fine temporary arrangement. We told our children, who always knew that we were trying to get Tyler, that we would introduce Tyler to the dog in a few weeks after he had gotten some therapy for his fear. They both said they understood. \n\nThe first week was fine, no trouble. Then three days ago my husband called me and said there was an emergency. I rushed home and found him trying to calm down a crying and hyperventilating Tyler, it took two hours for the kid to fully calm down.\n\nAfterwards my husband told me that Jack had deliberately brought the dog inside Tyler's room. My husband heard Tyler screaming and found Tyler on top of his desk crying while our son kept pushing the dog towards him, laughing and mocking Tyler. \n\nNow Tyler is terrified and can't relax at all. Leah took him for a sleepover in her own room because he was too scared to sleep alone in his. Jack hasn't apologized and has shown no remorse for his actions. I decided to temporarily send the dog to my sister who has dogsat for us in the past. She has a big house, a big yard, three kids and another dog that get along with ours and her house is a ten minute walk away from ours so the kids will be able to see our dog whenever. I plan to bring the dog back when Tyler isn't so scared and I can trust my son to not use the dog to attack his family members.\n\nMy husband and my daughter both agree with me but my son keeps calling me the asshole and some friends say I am punishing the dog. So AITA?\n\nEdit1: I have also grounded my son for two weeks with no electronics and he is to stay in his room at all times. He still refuses to say why he did it or apologize. He kept laughing and calling Tyler a crybaby after the incident and didn't seem bothered by anything until I told him I was temporarily sending the dog away. Then he started yelling and cursing at me, his dad, Leah, my BIL when he came to pick up the dog.", "created_utc": 1671405455, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zpbe4h/aita_for_temporarily_sending_my_sons_dog_away/", "score": 99, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Tyler isn't the only one that needs therapy. A lot is going on in Jack's world, all of the focus is on a different child, he's losing his pup, he's losing his parent's attention, and this seems like one of those acting out as a result things. He probably wants Tyler gone to stop the change.\n\nIf you lean into punishing Jack without spending time acknowledging the big changes that are going on and getting him some help, this situation is only going to escalate. A dog is not the only thing he could harm Tyler with.\n\nAll that said, it's a good plan. But you can't execute it without addressing the root of the problem also.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but that is a step for Tyler's safety, not a punishment for your son. He needs more than that. \n\nI see where your friends are coming from, you are sending the dog away for your son's actions, and being away from his family is a punishment for the dog. That said, right now it's not safe for the dog to be with you, and it sounds like your sister will take great care of him and make sure he's well loved.", "NTA. I would suggest your son also needs therapy to adjust to his new family member as it sounds like he is struggling to adjust", "Keeping your son in his room, away from his family, for 2 weeks when he\u2019s obviously having problems accepting the new family dynamics is not going to prove helpful. It will most likely increase his sense of displacement and resentment. Please contact a qualified therapist asap, your son needs someone who isn\u2019t emotionally invested to talk to about how these changes are affecting him.", "NTA fir sending the dog away so that your house is a safe place for Tyler. Also, your house is no longer a safe place for your dog. \n\nPlease get professional counseling for your son. A 13 year old is aware what he is doing when he is using an animal to terrify another person. \n\nAdditionally, your son is training your large dog to be aggressive. \n\nEven if you do find a different foster home for Tyler, do not bring the dog back into the home until your son fully understands the full implications of his bullying behavior.", "Two words: family therapy.\n\nThis won't be a one off. Your youngest is suddenly no longer the one to be doted on. While you have considered all the \"logistics\" I think you're really missing the emotional logistics. You're right, you had no time to prep, so no way your teens had any real time to prep for this either. \n\nYou are very lucky no one was seriously hurt, including the dog.", "As a foster mom with 4 other kids.  You need to get your son into therapy along with the family.  For your son to behave that way he has some resentment towards Tyler & you need to address it now or it will only get worse.  Tyler also needs therapy to deal with the fear he has about dogs.  I would keep the dog in a safe place until all this has happened. I wish you luck.", "INFO - Who was watching the kids when this went down?", "NTA. You laid out the boundaries to your son, who recognized them then turned around and used Tyler's worst fear against him. There are consequences to ones actions.", "I think both of your sons need therapy, tbh. Jack did an extremely cruel thing that displays a lack of empathy that I would expect from a child his age. He might be reacting poorly to having another child in the house, or have something underneath going wrong. Either way, this isn't something that I would consider okay from a kid his age. (I have 3 kids, personally, 18f,14m, and 10f)  \n\n\nYou're not punishing the dog, btw. You have found him a nice temporary accomodation. But, trauma like Tyler's might be a long haul for treatment, and if I were you, I would be making some long term Plan B type backup plans for the doggo.", "ESH look, your son was very very cruel. He deserves punishment. The dog is probably safer at your sisters for now, but not as punishment, rather as safety. Your son, he needs therapy AND your whole family needs it and some team building trust exercises. It\u2019s a HUGE change for all the kids. Yes, your son is old enough to know better but maybe not mature enough to explain his feelings on having this thrust on him and His world.", "NTA.  The pup will probably be less stressed at sister's and it's familiar. Dog is good. Boy can walk there in 10 or bike in less time. Maybe spend the night there.", "NTA.   But I think you need to get to the root of Jacks problem.  If this is out of the ordinary behavior your son, then your best bet is to get him into immediate counseling before it spirals out of control.  Seriously this needs to be dealt with and I doubt punishment alone is the answer.", "I'm not going to say that you're an AH, what your son did was very concerning, but I do think that you also need to be more honest with your son. Trauma like Tyler has experienced won't go away in weeks or months. The dog is never coming back, and you need to stop lying to your child about it. Also, as much as what your son did is horrible, what you're doing to Jack is no better than what he did to Tyler. Shutting your child up in his room is not the way to handle this. If anything, you're going to foster even more resentment that way. Jack is going to feel like Tyler has completely displaced him as a member of the family, and if you lock him in his room for two weeks? He isn't wrong. \n\nAlso, from your replies, I have to wonder if you even like your son. It seems like your whole world revolves around Tyler and Tyler's needs, but you don't seem to have given a single thought to how overwhelming the situation must be for your children. Why have you not sought out supports for them, as well as Tyler? This is a decision that you and your spouse likely discussed, but I doubt that you did so with your children. Change is hard, especially when a child feels like they've essentially been booted out of the family with no support system.\n\nFor now, ESH, but for the love of everything, remember that you have to consider more than Tyler. Your children still matter.", "NTA\n\nThis is a family adjustment and you could all benefit from counseling. \nYour son has a dog that I have no idea how long he had waited for one and then was asked to restrict the dog (for good reasons) and now the dog is away again, valid. I have know idea how he felt about Tyler before hand, he may not have liked, may not have thought about him, but now he is in the home, getting attention, accommodations being made.\n\nJack and your daughter have had a major change, you need to address this or it will get worse. Jack is no longer the youngest in the house.\n\nYou are right to have the dog out of the house. Try to arrange for Jack to visit, get videos, etc. \n\nAs a unit, you need a professional to help guide the family through this change.\n\nI\u2019m sorry about your friends\u2026.", "[deleted]", "So you did the right thing with getting the dog out of the environment for it's safety for sure, NTA. Punishment is well deserved for being that cruel. However, you say you've been trying for this for a while, how long though. Has this been at the forefront for a while and your younger child isn't processing it? Your comments about your son don't make it sound like you understand his feelings or are trying to get to the root cause of why he did something and instead focus on Tyler only. This is a brand new change for your family and from this brief snapshot it doesn't seem like any of you were actually prepared for it. Everyone could probably do with some individual therapy as well as group therapy because there is an underlying sense this isn't a temporary placement and likely your son won't get his dog back. Are you prepared for that conversation and the fallout?", "ESH\n\nRight now, you are so focused on Tyler that your son doesn't matter to you anymore. He shouldn't have done that. But that happened because you failed to prepare your family for this charge. You said you were trying for months to get Tyler. Why didn't you spend this time preparing your children for this change? Maybe you should just finish this and send your son away with the dog. Because he can torment Tyler without a dog. And he will because he sees you are replacing him. This happened because you failed. \n\nYour son will resent you and Tyler more and more. What he did is wrong but this didn't come out of nowhere.", "YTA, so you bring a child traumatized by dogs in to a house with a large dog and predictably an issue arose. \n\nMake no mistake Jack is wholly in the wrong here and what he did was cruel but now you've effectively driven a deeper wedge between jack and Tyler as I guarantee jack will blame Tyler for losing his beloved family pet. \n\nI mean really what's your lomg term solution here about his dog trauma? I've read all your responses and it's clear you aren't close or attentive enough to your biological son to see he had an issue with this adoption forced on him, so how are you gonna resolve this where your son doesn't lose the family dog of over a year?\n\nTo not even think to begin therapy for everyone involved with you adding an entirely new person to your family with unique needs that are directly against your current family dynamic is borderline negligent in my opinion.", "NTA - Big time. Your son made a stupid choice to torment and found out his actions have consequences. Bullying a traumatized child is abhorrent. He knew what the boundaries were and he chose to cross them to make a kid cry and scream.\n\nThe dog is in a safe and familiar environment where it will be well-taken care of. One thing I would say is try not to put pressure or a timetable on Tyler and his recovery. Getting through this trauma could take a long time so let him work through it at his own pace. I\u2019m sure Jack will already be trying to blame him for this, so try to reassure Tyler that this wasn\u2019t his fault and he\u2019s allowed to take his time until he feels safe.", "ESH. Everything really sucks here and it's very, very complicated. Where your children involved when you decided to take in your close friend's child? Did you allow them in the process? Meet him ahead of time? I have a feeling your son feels like he's being replaced and that family and individual therapy is going to be needed. 13 is such a vulnerable age. Bullying like this tells me your son is deeply hurt but doesn't want to be seen as such because he's probably been told to not be a crybaby.   \n\n\nOn top of this, your son has bonded to a dog and that dog has now been taken away. I've had my dog taken away for a whole year (the rental at the time didn't accept dogs) and the trauma is insurmountable. Granted, my dog was not 10 minutes away, but there are much better ways to go about this and a trauma therapist is likely to suggest the same method. Split you house in two - those that Tyler can access and the area Tyler can't. Wall the area he's not allowed with baby gates or any natural doors present. Make sure there's access to the backyard on the area Tyler won't have access. Your dog goes on the nonassessable side. If the sight of the dog bothers him, poster board over the baby gate holes temporarily. He'll be able to hear the dog, but not see. It's exposure therapy. You slowly take away the poster board, then the gates. Strongly recommend a gate or two with doors so your kids can have time with their dog. (This is how I got over many fears as an Autistic. This only works if your children understand the dog stays *behind* those gates.)", "Your son doesn\u2019t like Tyler that\u2019s why this is all happening you should\u2019ve talked to Jack before brining another child into the house into your family and you sending the dog away is just nasty yes what your son did was nasty \nYour just going to make your son hate you and things could get worse for Tyler", "NTA and this is another case where I\u2019m baffled by the Y T A comments.\n\nUsually I\u2019m against rehoming animals, especially in cases where kids are involved and attached. But in this case, said kid used the dog to bully another child without remorse. This is scary behavior that could have been much worse for all parties including the dog. You tried to do a slower introduction and Jack thwarted it.\n\nI\u2019m sure Jack is having trouble and probably has a lot of feelings going on. You do need to really talk to and listen to him, as well as get him into therapy. That said, there\u2019s no excuse for his behavior and the fact that he laughed at another traumatized child is very very worrisome. Has he ever acted similarly before? \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re doing the best you can given the less-than-ideal circumstances. Jack\u2019s world has been turned upside down and he needs help sorting through it appropriately.", "YTA....was taking on Tyler a family decision? Did both of your kids agree to this? Jack did the wrong thing and obviously resents Tyler coming in and upsetting your family dynamics and apparently lost his dog as well..", "NTA ; you did the right thing by offering shelter to your late friends kid, especially after such an awful thing happened to him at his previous home. I can\u2019t imagine how traumatic it must be to lose both of your parents and then be sent to the hospital by a foster families pet. The dog is still in Jack\u2019s life, it\u2019s not like it was taken to a shelter. Your son proved he\u2019s not responsible enough to have a dog by using it to terrorize another kid for enjoyment. Please get them both in therapy; they need it for vastly different reasons.", "For your specific question, NTA, but you will be a huge asshole and bad parent if you don't get Jack into therapy immediately because he is displaying some legitimately concerning, if not alarming, behaviors and attitude that you need to get professional help for as fast as you possibly can.", "NTA. You did the right thing. What you need to get to the bottom of now is why your son purposefully tormented Tyler. He clearly has some unresolved feelings about Tyler being in your home that have little to do with the dog.", "YTA for WHY you sent the dog away. You don't take a child's beloved pet, after restricting the dog into unfair conditions, as punishment. If you were sending the dog away temporarily to get Tyler used to the home and therapy that would be fine but you even said you sent the dog away to punish Jake. \n\nAdditionally, grounding Jake is fine. Restricting him to his room for two weeks makes him not part of the family. You plan to spend that time with Leah and Tyler and this is only going to further move Jake away from wanting Tyler in the home or wanting to mend that relationship. what Jake needs is family therapy, potentially individual therapy and some time to adjust. Take the electronics and time with friends, that is fine. Don't restrict him to his room to stew over how his life has changed without any input from him as to his life changing. \n\nTyler needs extra support but so does Jake. Don't lose sight of that.", "WOW YTA. Really!\n\nYou don\u2019t adopt a child that is terrified of dogs, when you own a dog.\n\nI am absolutely sorry for your son.\n\nJack needs punishment, but this is wrong.", "YTA\n\nWhy would you even accept Tyler knowing his fear of dogs?? Fuck that, why the hell would the state let you take him knowing about your dog?? You brought this on yourself and that boy is suffering because of it.", "NTA, but you've got a much bigger problem, your son intentionally scared Tyler and has no remorse.", "YTA it seems like you're neglecting your son and you don't even realize how potentially traumatizing this entire experience (both the adoption and losing his dog) is for him because you're so focused on Tyler. It's not surprising for me that Jack lacks empathy for Tyler. You seem to lack empathy for Jack.", "YTA - not because of the dog. \n\nBecause you decided to bring another child into your home without consideration of you other children feelings. Hes 13 - hes got some BIG feelings.", "NTA but your son is.  What he did was bullying. He was getting his kicks out of seeing someone scared.  He\u2019s a bully plain and simple and that is what needs to be addressed here.  \n\nAbsolutely check your behaviour (I don\u2019t want to say you caused this but it\u2019s important to note that it can happen). Do you share posts on Facebook that make fun of what people wear?  Do you buy those magazines that make fun of people?  Do you watch shows with bullies?  \n\nIf not then that\u2019s great and his behaviour needs to be addressed because 100% what he did was bullying and the fact he doesn\u2019t understand that is just part of the problem.   Calling someone a crybaby - definitely bullying.  But the fact is your son ENJOYED the power he got at scaring this kid and making fun of him.  \n\nI\u2019m glad you found the dog a good home.

Also, you cannot move a random ten year old in (who takes up huge amounts of your attention and resources), tell your son this is his new brother, and ban your son\u2019s dog from the house on the new kid\u2019s behalf and expect the situation to end well.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve been pursuing this for a while\u2014when did you tell your kids and what did they say then?", "No offense but you think keeping jack locked in his room for two weeks on Christmas no less is going to make him see reason.Its just going to make him more resentful and angry.", "There really should have been therapy and lots of discussions about the planned changes BEFORE bringing Tyler home. You need immediate individual therapy for both Tyler and Jack plus family therapy for everybody.", "You didn't read the post", "I don't have an issue with temporarily sending the dog away for the dog's safety although I doubt it will be temporary. These fears can take years to be resolved. I do question if the social workers really spent time finding out if the older kids were comfortable with Tyler being there, if they questioned the large dog in the home and I question the reasoning of having the older boy restricted to his room for two weeks when he is already struggling. Two weeks restricted away from his parents and sister is not going to make him accept Tyler. \n\nI also advised the OP to stop referring to Tyler as a family member to her son. That is not going to make him accepting. Let it happen when it happens and with therapy. If anything, a forced bond or acceptance is going to build more resentment.", "One thing you need to stop doing is telling your son that Tyler is a family member. He isn't yet in your son's mind and you haven't given him any reason to see him as such as of yet. You cannot expect your son to just accept a new brother outright because you said so. Therapy needed to start as soon as you started to think about having Tyler in your home. Now therapy needs to begin immediately and you may not like the outcome of that as the therapist may suggest that yours is not the best home for Tyler. \n\nDid the social workers question your children as to whether or not they wanted Tyler in the home? That is something social workers should do with older kids. Did the social workers question your ownership of the dog before sending Tyler to live with you?", "I mean, surely that's obvious. If you have a dog in your home, you don't adopt a child terrified of dogs", "\"He still refuses to say why he did it or apologize. He kept laughing and calling Tyler a crybaby after the incident and didn't seem bothered by anything until I told him I was temporarily sending the dog away.\"\n\nTHIS is the biggest red flag. Jack is being extremely cruel to Tyler, and is unapologetic about it.  He thought the whole thing was funny until the dog had to go somewhere else. He has zero remorse for his actions.  \n\nOP needs to get Jack into therapy and get to the bottom of this.", "I am not being defensive. Tyler only came to live in my home ten days ago. There are not many family therapists where we live so it takes at least a week to schedule a session. The dog incident happened only two days ago. I know that we will need professional help to get through this. I am planning to seek out a therapist in the morning.", "This. The fact Jack seemed to be so gleefully cruel and was STILL laughing about it, is disturbing.", "As a person that was attacked by a dog, don't discount the possible healing he could do. Dogs are everywhere, a lot of people don't give two shits if you are afraid of them. \"oh, but he's friendly!\" \"He won't bite!\" Is everywhere. It's not okay, but it is something you have to learn to live with. My parents kept our dogs after the incident, they didn't do anything wrong. Was it hard? Yes. Was it helpful to have gentle dogs around? Yes. Did it take time? Yes. 5 years? No. \n\nHe may never want to be anywhere near a dog again, but that isn't guaranteed. It could be temporary. It should definitely be acknowledged that it could be forever, but no one knows right now. \n\n\n\nBut that's not what matters right now. The son is a danger to the boy. Hurt feelings and acting out can be expected. Using another kids trauma against them, taking joy in causing a panic attack, and showing zero remorse is terrifying. Taking the dog away was the nicest answer here. The son needed some consequence, and the 10 year old needed to feel safe from at least one threat in the house. It is a hard situation all around, but there is a path to follow out of this.", "I don't know what my children told the social worker because he talked with them privately and he didn't raise any concerns with me afterwards. He didn't mention the dog so I think he may not be fully aware of Tyler's level of terror. Social workers, especially those who work with children, are notoriously overworked with far too many charges, at least here. \n\nAlso, Tyler is staying here. He has no other family  and he was already abused in his former foster home. My son being jealous, and not even expressing his dissatisfaction to me or his father, is not an excuse to send a traumatized child somewhere he can be abused further.", "wouldn't the child be a higher priority here? You can rehome the dog. It's a good dog,and there is already someone else willing to take them in. You would rather leave a child in an abusive foster situation then give a dog away to a perfectly good home?", "That's a good start. I'd also recommend you connect with a dog trainer as well. To teach Jack how dangerous dogs can be and why people's boundaries towards them should be respected, train the dog how to behave in those situations and give an \"override\" come here right now command, and, with Tyler's consent, help him see how a dog can work to not be scary. There's a *ton* of layers to this, and dismantling it will not be easy. \n\nI feel like I've been saying this a lot these past few days, but dogs are a predatory species. They hunt, they have a prey drive. Tyler, by jumping around and screaming, acted like prey (not that I blame him for the actions; i don't, at all, just describing what this could look like from an animal's point of view). Depending on his size and the dog, it very easily could have switched the dog into hunting mode, or could have made the dog feel threatened, or made the dog overstimulated, which could cause a bite. Have the trainer point this out to Jack, and explain how the local laws in regards to biting dogs work. He's old enough to understand that a dog that bites gets euthanized or rehomed. He put the dog in a situation to make it bite, whether he was aware of the severity or not. Sometimes having an outsider explain this to them can help, as it's not just their parenting lecturing them but a person with authority", "A week to schedule a session? I have been on a waitlist for a month to see a therapist and it will be at least 4 more months of wait.", "What your son did goes further than jealousy. He acted maliciously, planned it out, and was (possibly inadvertently) putting himself, the dog, and Tyler in danger as well as training the dog to act with aggression. Your son continuing to treat Tyler poorly would make your home just as safe as the one he was abused in. Take into account other forms of abuse as well. Are you sure you're son isn't/ won't say hurtful things to Tyler when no one is around? With his lack of remorse for this act, and just being a 13 year old boy, I'm sure he could think of some truly horrific things to say to make Tyler feel unwelcome. This isn't to shit on you at all, this is a really rough situation. I couldn't imagine being in that position. But you have to keep a clear head now, defensiveness could make it all worse. \n\n\nOP, this sucks. Take time to yourself to break down when you need to, to recharge so you can be there for your kids and yourself. You are going to get through this. It may be difficult, but you are strong and capable. Just have to keep pushing through. I hope it all works out, good luck.", "Yes, Tyler is staying there unless it is not the right place for him. Your son may be jealous so help your son! Your focus cannot be just on Tyler's comfort or needs. Your son's feelings are valid even if his behavior isn't. Acknowledge his feelings, have a discussion with him, let him know that you respect that he may not feel the same way about Tyler as you do and that you understand that he is struggling. Acknowledge the changes in your home and how they have affected your son. Let him know that it is okay to see Tyler as a friend for now and that you won't force bonding. And please do not restrict the child away from his family for two weeks. You are still his parents. His sister is still his sister. Don't let him stew in anger for two weeks while everyone else bonds.", "If your son does express sadness/discomfort about Tyler\u2019s presence, how will you respond?", "You are thinking of Tyler and that is great, but what about Jack. What he did is so clearly a cry for help. Every response is telling you this and you seem to gloss over it. Tyler is not a good fit for your home if all family members are not on board.", "Take it from someone who fostered. Right now he feels like you picked tyler. And you calling him jealous is petty. He is a child who\u2019s parents chose someone else.  \n\nDoesn\u2019t make your decision good or bad, but I had to choose between my son and my foster daughter (she had too many issues for my house to handle). The reason being I was always in a doctor visit or therapist visit for her and I never saw my son. \n\nSo glad I figured it out because I would have lost him. I loved my foster daughter, but he was my child. I chose him.", "No. Sorry but the dog who is already part of the family AND my son's dog does have higher priority. I won't traumatize my son by giving away his dog. Tbf though I also wouldn't make my son feel like I'm getting a replacement for him to the point he feels like his only chance of getting his mom's attention back is scaring the new kid away by the means of his dog - because I think Jack's thinking was exactly that. The son isn't the issue here, the dog isn't, the new son isn't. The parents clearly haven't prepared for this entire situation at all and just expected the kids to deal with it - and now they don't like the way their son is dealing with it.", "Not really no. When bringing a Foster child in the whole family needs to be on board and prepared, throwing away the family dog to bring in another child is simply going to cause resentment.", "If the dog is already a member of the family and has been for over a year, I wouldn\u2019t take in a child deathly afraid of said dog.", "Sorry I need to push back here but it is absolutely NOT a good start for OP. \n\nOp brought a child traumatized by dogs into her home with a large dog, obviously didn't check in with her son about how he felt and is only now looking at therapy sessions?? \n\nThats negligent. Therapy sessions should have already been scheduled before they even brought in Tyler.", "I love my dog. I really do. But if I had to choose between a dog and a child? I would choose the child - the \\*suffering human child\\*. And my children would have to deal with the truth that I chose a human life over a dog.  That you wouldn't makes me hope that you never have children.", "Yup, especially knowing I got the dog for my son. Honestly soft YTA. You\u2019re prioritizing Tyler above your own son which is bound to lead to resentment. I would not adopt a child at the detriment to my own children,", "That you say that to someone you don't know over differing opinions makes me hope yours grow up to be nothing like you if you have any. Have a great day and consider occasionally trying to keep in mind that the people you reply to on here are real people and you never know what someone is going through."]}
