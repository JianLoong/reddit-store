You were n-t-a up until the point you called the police.  That's where things turn on a dime.  You don't involve the police unless you absolutely have to, period.  Meaning, you should have warned your daughter at least several times before you took such a DRASTIC and DAMAGING action.  You absolutely have a right to not babysit your grandkid.  But you are horrible for putting your daughter and grandkid in that situation without exhausting all remedies.  You should apologize and, if possible, talk with CPS in order to smooth things over by suggesting there was a family misunderstanding that was caused by you.", "NTA. You said you didn\u2019t want to watch the baby and she wouldn\u2019t answer. At least you didn\u2019t leave it alone and went to bed.

You would rather have your grandson end up in foster care than actually talk to your child and parent her?\n\nI am a foster parent. The system is brutal and horrific and traumatizing.", "I can't call you what I'd like to call you, so I'll just say YTA. \n\nIt is never anyone's responsibility to care for another, however you must give absolutely zero shits about your daughter or grandson to do what you did. Asshole.", "YTA. You two should've talked things through and looked into a day care or other baby sitter.", "ESH Your daughter was young when she had a baby two years ago. Young adults aren't notorious for thinking things thru and considering the consequences. She needs to take responsibility for her child and as a parent. She needs to respond to the people who are watching her child. She disregarded your objection to her leaving her son without a sitter and she did it anyway. She didn't respond when you called and texted. You have your daughter no warning if she didn't take her responsibilities as a parent seriously next time she left her son with you over your objection, you would involve the authorities. Sadly now, this innocent child is in the custody of CPS because you two don't communicate well.", "INFO How much warning did you give your daughter that you weren't going to watch the baby anymore? From your post is kind of sounds like you had been doing it without complaint and just snapped yesterday.", "ESH: She shouldn't be expecting you to watch him. She made the decisions that led to the pregnancy and chose to keep the baby, so she gets to live with the consequences. Most people don't get free babysitting. She shouldn't expect you to provide free babysitting.\n\nHowever, you could have set this boundary much, much sooner rather than waiting like you did in this instance. You waited too long, didn't consistently enforce your boundaries, and then went to the absolute extreme when you finally decided to enforce it.\n\nThis boundary ideally should have been set before she even got pregnant. Just a simple, \"I will never watch your children for free if you get pregnant, so you will either have to pay me (and that's if I'm available) or figure something else out\", and then stick to it. Lots of parents do this up front before their teens ever even get pregnant, so It's a totally reasonable boundary to have. It just has to be stated and enforced from the get go.", "First, YTA for using the police to teach your daughter a lesson.

Honestly, if you had been clear and not let her live with you in the first place or been firm from the outset it might have forced her to find living arrangements where her baby didn\u2019t suddenly end up at the police described as abandoned.\n\nFifth, YTA for lying to the police about the child being abandoned. \n\nI could go on and on\u2026", "ESH.

You: you took your 2yo grandson to the police station and left him there for him to be taken away from everything he knows. I understand you're tired and it isn't your responsibility to look after him. But instead of abandoning him you should have sat down with your daughter and set up an actual plan instead of just having passing by 'I can't watch him, I'm tired', 'I don't have a babysitter' etc. Set a proper plan where a regular babysitter is hired for regular hours.", "Feels to me like YTA. Your daughter put you in a pretty awful position. But she is your daughter, and you are involved in her life. You were pushing her to get the job, letting her stay with you, making judgements about her life choices.\n\nThe non-AH thing to do would be to have sucked it up, or to have gone and found child care, then talked to her about it when she got back warning you would get the police and child protection involved if she does this ever again. I cannot conceive of abandoning a 2 year old i was related to at a police station personally. The lack of love here is breathtaking.", "YTA. I understand your frustration but you should have given her a verbal warning that if she left him w you again without ur consent that u would turn him into the police. CPS can ruin lives, i feel you jumped to the most severe thing you could do first.", "YTA", "I mean, are you for real? I get that daughter was totally out of line but didn\u2019t you feel scared as his grandma dumping him at the police station and now he\u2019s been taken by CPS?

Now that CPS is involved they will continue to be involved so I hope there\u2019s more to this\u2026 \n\nI\u2019m going with ESH because I just can\u2019t fathom someone doing this to their grandchild. He had to be scared to death.", "It's pretty easy to see the toxicity in this family. How is any of this reasonable to you? Your daughter's behavior is awful, and it's pretty clear she inherited it from you. Either you aren't intelligent enough to see that dropping off your own  grand baby at the police station is a ridiculous action,  or you are prone to overreacting and lashing out. Shameful, since you're supposed to be the wiser and more mature one in this scenario.", "ESH\n\nYou daughter sucks for not taking responsibility for her own child, and putting that on you when you have made it clear you do not want that responsibility.\n\nYou suck because your daughter is 20. You let her move back in, with her son, who is a baby. Yes, 20 is an adult, but as her parent you had to realize what this situation would actually look like. If she can't afford to live on her own, and only works part time as of recently (which you admitted you forced her to do), how is she going to pay for a babysitter?\n\nTaking your grandson to the police was a big overreaction. You put your child's child into child protective services out of spite.", "YTA - handing your grandchild over to the police was a terrible thing to do.

In one action, you were able to ensure that you have lost any meaningful relationship with your daughter and grandson for the rest of their lives. As you enter in your twilight years, you will have plenty of time to reflect on it, as you will be spending those years without either of them in your lives.\n\nThat was a truly monstrous way to handle it. While you certainly needed to correct your daughter, make sure she is working, and find a balance within your home, I\u2019m actually struggling to find a worse way to handle it. You have now unnecessarily put your grandson in a fairly heartless system, and showed your daughter that you are absolutely not to be trusted.  Not only did you miss a huge opportunity to have some compassion, but you are showing that you are actually an antagonist. The fact that you did some thing so tremendously terrible and are still not quite sure if you did something wrong is impressively mind boggling.\n\nYTA, I hope those few extra hours of sleep are worth it to you.", "What did I just read \ud83e\udd23 you dropped your grandson off at the police station and said he was abandoned.

Fuck. \n\nI remember reading how an OP\u2019s siblings would do the EXACT thing and people said \u2018call the cops on abandonment next time\u2019 and when it\u2019s done people call it CRUEL?! \n\nThis young woman needs to learn that she needs to get her shit together and figure out alternatives rather than take even MORE advantage of her mother.\n\nEdit: I am assuming due to the daughters lack of holding a job until forced, you were ponying up the financial burden for her and the child?! Or at least the majority of it. \n\nWhich is stupid if she decided to have a kid. And isn\u2019t in college or working.

Why didn't you say no I'm not doing it when she dropped them off? You didn't even give her a chance to make alternative arrangements you took her child away from her out of some fucked up spite and wanting to send some sort of horrible message that you aren't doing it anymore when a simple conversation would have sufficed!

Or because you normally are asleep during that time, you passed out while driving or something and weren\u2019t conscious while she\u2019s unreachable?

That would\u2019ve sent the message loud and clear that the next time she does this, you\u2019ll embarrass her again so she and her baby daddy need to figure it out. There is an unfortunate reality that CPS is awfully underfunded in this country so there\u2019s always a chance that the kid could end up with someone worse or not any other family at all.

For a grandparent to do this to their own apparent \u201c loved ones\u201d is abhorrent, selfish to the extreme and quite frankly unforgivable.

It makes sure the parent has every opportunity to keep their kid safe, even if the parent is an asshole who has been ignoring you when you say no. Of course it's about not being taken advantage of, but it's just as much about making sure the child is properly cared for.\n\nTo do it like this with no warning, where there was no attempt to protect the child at all before taking it to this extreme, is so cruel.

YTA", "YTA OP. \n\nYour daughter using you as a sitter is something you communicate in advance with her, not ONE FUCKING HOUR BEFORE THEY ARE SCHEDULED TO WORK. I understand that she didn't respect you saying \"no\" this time, but you also expect someone to be able to get childcare that quickly? You're an evil person, because instead of communicating a boundary, you made the conscious decision to put your TWO YEAR OLD GRANDSON in the system. You could have compromised this time, then communicated after your daughter had gotten back about needing a deadline for her having permanent childcare. You don't love your grandson or daughter, and to say you do is LAUGHABLE!

And when she gets her baby back (you know, the one you love so much!!!) that she never lets you within a mile of him. \n\nLastly, it\u2019s time for you to start some serious soul searching, and self reflection that takes a good honest  look at who you are and what you want to be- and therapy.

She\u2019s fairly new at her job - she might have lost her job had she called out.  It was wrong of her to leave the baby with you after you said no, but that\u2019s petty entitled sort of wrong - what she was asking wasn\u2019t unreasonable in and of itself, the problem is that she took it for granted.  \n\nWhat you did, on the other hand?  She did NOT abandon her child, she left him with a family member who was a frequent caretaker, who was physically and mentally competent to care for him, in the house where you both live, which is a safe environment - for a matter of hours only, not days or weeks.  In no world is this abandonment.  It was rudeness.  You gave your daughter\u2019s child away to punish her for being rude.  \n\nThat is evil.  Not mean, not wrong, not inappropriate - evil like the witch in the fairy tales evil.  Comic book villain evil.  Stephen King could write a whole book about you, evil.  \n\nI don\u2019t know how you ever make up for this, really.  Consider your relationship with your daughter nuked from space.  At bare minimum, you need to go tell the police and/or CPS that you lied, and take the fall for making the false report.  If you can afford a lawyer - and by \u201cafford\u201d I mean if it requires remortgaging the house and eating rice and beans by candlelight for the rest of your natural life, that\u2019s what you do - you need to give her the money to hire a lawyer.", ">dumping him at the police station\n\nAND LYING TO THEM!
