You were n-t-a up until the point you called the police.  That's where things turn on a dime.  You don't involve the police unless you absolutely have to, period.  Meaning, you should have warned your daughter at least several times before you took such a DRASTIC and DAMAGING action.  You absolutely have a right to not babysit your grandkid.  But you are horrible for putting your daughter and grandkid in that situation without exhausting all remedies.  You should apologize and, if possible, talk with CPS in order to smooth things over by suggesting there was a family misunderstanding that was caused by you.", "NTA. You said you didn\u2019t want to watch the baby and she wouldn\u2019t answer. At least you didn\u2019t leave it alone and went to bed.

You would rather have your grandson end up in foster care than actually talk to your child and parent her?\n\nI am a foster parent. The system is brutal and horrific and traumatizing.", "I can't call you what I'd like to call you, so I'll just say YTA. \n\nIt is never anyone's responsibility to care for another, however you must give absolutely zero shits about your daughter or grandson to do what you did. Asshole.", "YTA. You two should've talked things through and looked into a day care or other baby sitter.", "ESH Your daughter was young when she had a baby two years ago. Young adults aren't notorious for thinking things thru and considering the consequences. She needs to take responsibility for her child and as a parent. She needs to respond to the people who are watching her child. She disregarded your objection to her leaving her son without a sitter and she did it anyway. She didn't respond when you called and texted. You have your daughter no warning if she didn't take her responsibilities as a parent seriously next time she left her son with you over your objection, you would involve the authorities. Sadly now, this innocent child is in the custody of CPS because you two don't communicate well.", "INFO How much warning did you give your daughter that you weren't going to watch the baby anymore? From your post is kind of sounds like you had been doing it without complaint and just snapped yesterday.", "ESH: She shouldn't be expecting you to watch him. She made the decisions that led to the pregnancy and chose to keep the baby, so she gets to live with the consequences. Most people don't get free babysitting. She shouldn't expect you to provide free babysitting.\n\nHowever, you could have set this boundary much, much sooner rather than waiting like you did in this instance. You waited too long, didn't consistently enforce your boundaries, and then went to the absolute extreme when you finally decided to enforce it.\n\nThis boundary ideally should have been set before she even got pregnant. Just a simple, \"I will never watch your children for free if you get pregnant, so you will either have to pay me (and that's if I'm available) or figure something else out\", and then stick to it. Lots of parents do this up front before their teens ever even get pregnant, so It's a totally reasonable boundary to have. It just has to be stated and enforced from the get go.", "First, YTA for using the police to teach your daughter a lesson.

Honestly, if you had been clear and not let her live with you in the first place or been firm from the outset it might have forced her to find living arrangements where her baby didn\u2019t suddenly end up at the police described as abandoned.\n\nFifth, YTA for lying to the police about the child being abandoned. \n\nI could go on and on\u2026", "ESH.

You: you took your 2yo grandson to the police station and left him there for him to be taken away from everything he knows. I understand you're tired and it isn't your responsibility to look after him. But instead of abandoning him you should have sat down with your daughter and set up an actual plan instead of just having passing by 'I can't watch him, I'm tired', 'I don't have a babysitter' etc. Set a proper plan where a regular babysitter is hired for regular hours.", "Feels to me like YTA. Your daughter put you in a pretty awful position. But she is your daughter, and you are involved in her life. You were pushing her to get the job, letting her stay with you, making judgements about her life choices.\n\nThe non-AH thing to do would be to have sucked it up, or to have gone and found child care, then talked to her about it when she got back warning you would get the police and child protection involved if she does this ever again. I cannot conceive of abandoning a 2 year old i was related to at a police station personally. The lack of love here is breathtaking.", "YTA. I understand your frustration but you should have given her a verbal warning that if she left him w you again without ur consent that u would turn him into the police. CPS can ruin lives, i feel you jumped to the most severe thing you could do first.", "YTA", "I mean, are you for real? I get that daughter was totally out of line but didn\u2019t you feel scared as his grandma dumping him at the police station and now he\u2019s been taken by CPS?

Now that CPS is involved they will continue to be involved so I hope there\u2019s more to this\u2026 \n\nI\u2019m going with ESH because I just can\u2019t fathom someone doing this to their grandchild. He had to be scared to death.", "It's pretty easy to see the toxicity in this family. How is any of this reasonable to you? Your daughter's behavior is awful, and it's pretty clear she inherited it from you. Either you aren't intelligent enough to see that dropping off your own  grand baby at the police station is a ridiculous action,  or you are prone to overreacting and lashing out. Shameful, since you're supposed to be the wiser and more mature one in this scenario.", "ESH\n\nYou daughter sucks for not taking responsibility for her own child, and putting that on you when you have made it clear you do not want that responsibility.\n\nYou suck because your daughter is 20. You let her move back in, with her son, who is a baby. Yes, 20 is an adult, but as her parent you had to realize what this situation would actually look like. If she can't afford to live on her own, and only works part time as of recently (which you admitted you forced her to do), how is she going to pay for a babysitter?\n\nTaking your grandson to the police was a big overreaction. You put your child's child into child protective services out of spite.", "YTA - handing your grandchild over to the police was a terrible thing to do.

In one action, you were able to ensure that you have lost any meaningful relationship with your daughter and grandson for the rest of their lives. As you enter in your twilight years, you will have plenty of time to reflect on it, as you will be spending those years without either of them in your lives.\n\nThat was a truly monstrous way to handle it. While you certainly needed to correct your daughter, make sure she is working, and find a balance within your home, I\u2019m actually struggling to find a worse way to handle it. You have now unnecessarily put your grandson in a fairly heartless system, and showed your daughter that you are absolutely not to be trusted.  Not only did you miss a huge opportunity to have some compassion, but you are showing that you are actually an antagonist. The fact that you did some thing so tremendously terrible and are still not quite sure if you did something wrong is impressively mind boggling.\n\nYTA, I hope those few extra hours of sleep are worth it to you.", "What did I just read \ud83e\udd23 you dropped your grandson off at the police station and said he was abandoned.

Fuck. \n\nI remember reading how an OP\u2019s siblings would do the EXACT thing and people said \u2018call the cops on abandonment next time\u2019 and when it\u2019s done people call it CRUEL?! \n\nThis young woman needs to learn that she needs to get her shit together and figure out alternatives rather than take even MORE advantage of her mother.\n\nEdit: I am assuming due to the daughters lack of holding a job until forced, you were ponying up the financial burden for her and the child?! Or at least the majority of it. \n\nWhich is stupid if she decided to have a kid. And isn\u2019t in college or working.

Why didn't you say no I'm not doing it when she dropped them off? You didn't even give her a chance to make alternative arrangements you took her child away from her out of some fucked up spite and wanting to send some sort of horrible message that you aren't doing it anymore when a simple conversation would have sufficed!

Or because you normally are asleep during that time, you passed out while driving or something and weren\u2019t conscious while she\u2019s unreachable?

That would\u2019ve sent the message loud and clear that the next time she does this, you\u2019ll embarrass her again so she and her baby daddy need to figure it out. There is an unfortunate reality that CPS is awfully underfunded in this country so there\u2019s always a chance that the kid could end up with someone worse or not any other family at all.

She traumatized her grandson to prove a point that could have been resolved and communicated in so many other ways. Poor kid.", "Omg judgemental as f**k !! You don\u2019t know any of that is true. What a warped way to view this situation, just because the daughter has a child with one arsehole does not guarantee a future of arseholes resulting in CPS becoming involved as a given in the child\u2019s future! For a grandparent to do this to their own apparent \u201c loved ones\u201d is abhorrent, selfish to the extreme and quite frankly unforgivable. Yes, helping raise your grandchildren is exhausting, time consuming, fraught with difficulties and compromises to navigate but the love, joy, pride and reward given by these little humans far far outweigh any perceived burdens.

And seemingly feeling nothing about her grandson now being in the system?!? It\u2019s truly wild.", "I\u2019m very sorry that you experienced that but I don\u2019t understand what that has to do with this.", "Leaving a child with a grandparent in the home they share really isn\u2019t abandonment. Yeah it\u2019s a bit of a dick move but her excuse for abandoning the kid into police care was because OP was TIRED. Leaving a child with a tired grandparent isn\u2019t abandonment; no one could expect a grandparent to behave that way, because OP is insane", "If grandma, mom, and the baby all live at 123 Main St., and mom put the baby on grandma\u2019s bed, the baby was not abandoned. Was it shitty of the daughter to do? Of course. But that\u2019s not abandonment. \n\nGrandma waited until mom was at work (or otherwise unavailable; idk if mom takes public transport & didn\u2019t have a signal, etc) to do this all. \n\nShe lied to the police & jeopardized her grandson\u2019s safety & future to teach her daughter a lesson. \n\nShe created an entire child abuse/neglect case out of spite. Not concern \u2014 spite. Now, mom has a CPS case, her child is with strangers after grandma left the kid in a police station, and the next steps are what? Give the kid back to mom, who doesn\u2019t have support & who lives w the woman who dropped the kid off? \n\nAgain - mom should\u2019ve planned better, but grandma shouldn\u2019t have nuked her child & grandchild\u2019s lives like that.

She\u2019s the guaranteed supervision!", "This\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f where I work we have to keep our phones locked up in our assigned locker which is back in the break room literally like a football field away from my station there's no way I would know someone's calling me especially when we have to put it on do not disturb while it's in our locker and I'm sure this girl's work situation is similar..", "She shouldn\u2019t have left her kid with an unwilling baby sitter then", "The daughter was taking care of the kid, mum forced her to get the job I doubt someone her age at a new job would be make enough to afford childcare. The daughter did what she was told and it wasn't good enough by the sounds of it", "Wtf? Her friends are most likely in the same boat as her by having full time jobs, being full time students or both.", "Which se coulr have told her daughter about a day before, rather than last minute. Also how is 8 to 4 a part time job? She didnt want her daughter to keep the baby clearly as is grasping at straws.", "Understood. Regardless of the circumstances, it is never the grandparent's responsibility to care for their grandchildren. (Unless of course it was a situation in which the daughter wanted an abortion or adoption and the grandmother pressured her to keep the baby with the understanding that she would help care for it).", "There's always a competent, loving home for an even relatively healthy newborn.  Abortion being restricted in (some parts of) a country doesn't suddenly give license for everyone to be lousy parents.\n\nThis is an ESH, but I'm so tired of this narrative that neglectful or abusive parenting is the only possible course of action for an unplanned pregnancy.\n\nIf you can't take care of a baby and you're too heartless to do the hard thing and leave them in a better home, then stick to hand, mouth, and butt stuff until you're ready to parent.\n\nThis poor toddler has no one.  If CPS can't connect the mom with resources to safely and adequately parent, I hope he's placed with someone who *can* care for him.", "Love doesn't mean letting your family members walk all over you and use you. If it's an extenuating circumstance, sure then step in and lend temporary support while your kids get back on their feet. At the same time, I've seen countless stories of adult children who take advantage of their parents and sit on their butts, go out, party, and get pregnant again while the grandparents watch their kids. Time and time again. Support can become enabling if there aren't clear cut timelines and boundaries.", "She left her child with op knowing that op said no. And then ignored the call.

The daughter is probably between a rock and a hard place now she might not be able to get her kid back without a fight", "She didnt give advance notice. Daughter had to work at 8am  OP says she left work st 7 am and THEN told daughter she was too tired to babysit. Feels like ahe did this all on purpose.

So sad.", "Off topic but my boxer ran into my knee too and it was really hurt for quite a while.", "You clearly do not understand.\n\nYou do not require your MIL and your mom to babysit 24/7, every day, with no real emergency, do you?

But they should never put your child at risk either. If OP had said no and brought the child to the mom at work, I would have been completely on her side. But it sounds like OP decided last minute that she couldn\u2019t help out, didn\u2019t have a conversation with her daughter, and then went nuclear by bringing the child into a system where children are abused and murdered far too often. If OP felt that things needed to change, having a conversation with her daughter and allowing her daughter time to find alternate child care is the bare minimum that should have happened.", "I can\u2019t agree that calling the police on your 20 year old daughter and having your grandson put into care is ever the way to go. Op is a nightmare.", "If thats the case, why couldn't the police locate her at work then? It sounds like she wasn't where she was supposed to be and was refusing to answer the phone - not sure how much warning OP gave the daughter that she wouldn't be babysitting anymore, but I definitely understand \"I've had zero sleep, told her I cannot do this, and she refuses to listen or find a compromise. I cannot do this.\" Its absolutely a nuclear option, I don't know if its warranted in this case or not, but I also can't slap a YTA on this one. I'm thinking ESH and hopefully that poor baby is placed somewhere he is better cared for.", "Its especially not abandonment given that it sounds like up until this exact day, grandma was the go to babysitter.", "Except it sounds like grandma has BEEN watching the child so is it actually shitty of the mom? It sounds in the post like she told her daughter last minute with no time to actually find another sitter. It was an issue of Grandma\u2019s making!", "I\u2019m not even sure how she could have planned better as it seemed this news was delivered to her as she was walking out the door to go to work. I would have called out anyway, but regardless OP set her up to now have a mark on her record for calling out 10 minutes before her shift. \n\nBy the way, she was going to the job OP bitched about her taking a long time to get! Would she have bitched about daughters paycheck being smaller due to missing a day as well? So what does she want here? To lead this girl to being a responsible parent and adult, or to jam her up and continue to punish her for having a baby young? \n\nThe kid wasn\u2019t abandoned by anyone but OP. How on earth are you leaving a 2 year old alone and scared in a police station? How did she even get any sleep after that?! I hope this is rage bait, otherwise OP lacks all reasonable empathy and shouldn\u2019t be around children at all.", "Per the post she actually has agreed to watch kiddo while she is at work or running errands. She let her daughter know basically as she was walking out the door that she didn\u2019t want to today. She seemed to know their shifts and how they overlapped, so why couldn\u2019t have this been communicated\u2026a week ago? How is daughter supposed to find child care in 10 minutes before going to work? To the job OP bitched about her taking awhile to get? She shouldn\u2019t have left kid there anyway, but OP set her up for failure here. \n\nMom shouldn\u2019t have left, but the reaction to this is actually crazy.", "We actually don't know if this is grandma or grandpa, btw. OP doesn't say gender. And, since daughter only lived with OP for the past 2 months, it also makes me think there's either another grandparent in the picture or daughter had a sudden upheaval in her living situation involving baby daddy. Kid is 2. That means the kid and mom have been elsewhere for over a year. That could make this even worse if daughter is just getting back on her feet. If OP is indicating to CPS they don't want the kid there and daughter doesn't have stable housing, it could push the kid into custody of a parent who seems to not be present already in the kid's life.", "Exactly. I\u2019ve seen grandparents who are emotionally, physically and financially overwhelmed by care for their grandchildren. Even worse is this idea of \u201con call last minute\u201d babysitting where the grandparents can\u2019t go or do anything because their adult child might show up to dump the grandkids on them. \n\nAdult children are master manipulators too \u201cdon\u2019t you want to spend time with your grandchildren?\u201d (Yeah but maybe not 50 hours a week) or \u201cif you can\u2019t care for them when I need you, then maybe you just shouldn\u2019t be in their lives at all\u201d. \n\nParenthood ends at 18 is BS.\n\nEdit: YTA for involving the police.", "Actually some jobs require you to have your phone in a locker and on do not disturb. And require you to leave the landline for the work as an emergency phone number only. Where I work we're not allowed to have our phones, they have to be turned fully off or on do not disturb and then our locker which is more than a football field away from our working stations. And we're not even allowed to turn our phone on when we go on our breaks. This girl's between a rock and a hard place, I pray she gets her child back but from my experience CPS doesn't want to reunite families they want to meet their quotas and adopt out as many kids as possible.

And she\u2019s young, so I imagine that she\u2019s just trying to do the best that she can", "Why do you suspect she was not at work?

She may not be easily reachable in the workplace depending on her job.", "Oh give me a break.  You don\u2019t take a child from his mother without a severe reason.  This is not it.  This child and his mother will be traumatized forever by this.", "Yes! And they lived together AND she was only going to work for a few hours. Just absolute horror for that poor daughter tbh. Yeah it sounds like she needed to look into more reliable babysitting options, but no one in their right mind would ever think their mum would drop their son off with the police because she wanted  to spend longer in bed that day", "Yeah, from the sound of the timing in the post, Mom was left in an impossible position.", "Raise your children, spoil your grandchildren or else if you spoil your children you\u2019ll be raising your grandchildren.", "This is a really good comment.", "I\u2019m sure OP would be pissed if the daughter lost her job for calling in last minute too since they had to \u201cforce\u201d her to get the job in the first place.

What good parent wants to add to their child and grandchild\u2019s suffering? Using the police? OP sounds abusive.", "Finally someone that understands. They literally have an hour between shifts, with transport time and everything else, her daughter was literally leaving the house when she said this.
