Meaning, you should have warned your daughter at least several times before you took such a DRASTIC and DAMAGING action.  You absolutely have a right to not babysit your grandkid.  But you are horrible for putting your daughter and grandkid in that situation without exhausting all remedies.  You should apologize and, if possible, talk with CPS in order to smooth things over by suggesting there was a family misunderstanding that was caused by you.", "NTA. You said you didn\u2019t want to watch the baby and she wouldn\u2019t answer. At least you didn\u2019t leave it alone and went to bed.

You would rather have your grandson end up in foster care than actually talk to your child and parent her?\n\nI am a foster parent. The system is brutal and horrific and traumatizing.", "I can't call you what I'd like to call you, so I'll just say YTA. \n\nIt is never anyone's responsibility to care for another, however you must give absolutely zero shits about your daughter or grandson to do what you did. Asshole.", "YTA. You two should've talked things through and looked into a day care or other baby sitter.", "ESH Your daughter was young when she had a baby two years ago. Young adults aren't notorious for thinking things thru and considering the consequences. She needs to take responsibility for her child and as a parent. She needs to respond to the people who are watching her child. She disregarded your objection to her leaving her son without a sitter and she did it anyway. She didn't respond when you called and texted. You have your daughter no warning if she didn't take her responsibilities as a parent seriously next time she left her son with you over your objection, you would involve the authorities. Sadly now, this innocent child is in the custody of CPS because you two don't communicate well.", "INFO How much warning did you give your daughter that you weren't going to watch the baby anymore? From your post is kind of sounds like you had been doing it without complaint and just snapped yesterday.", "ESH: She shouldn't be expecting you to watch him. She made the decisions that led to the pregnancy and chose to keep the baby, so she gets to live with the consequences. Most people don't get free babysitting. She shouldn't expect you to provide free babysitting.\n\nHowever, you could have set this boundary much, much sooner rather than waiting like you did in this instance. You waited too long, didn't consistently enforce your boundaries, and then went to the absolute extreme when you finally decided to enforce it.\n\nThis boundary ideally should have been set before she even got pregnant. Just a simple, \"I will never watch your children for free if you get pregnant, so you will either have to pay me (and that's if I'm available) or figure something else out\", and then stick to it. Lots of parents do this up front before their teens ever even get pregnant, so It's a totally reasonable boundary to have. It just has to be stated and enforced from the get go.", "First, YTA for using the police to teach your daughter a lesson.

Honestly, if you had been clear and not let her live with you in the first place or been firm from the outset it might have forced her to find living arrangements where her baby didn\u2019t suddenly end up at the police described as abandoned.\n\nFifth, YTA for lying to the police about the child being abandoned. \n\nI could go on and on\u2026", "ESH.

But instead of abandoning him you should have sat down with your daughter and set up an actual plan instead of just having passing by 'I can't watch him, I'm tired', 'I don't have a babysitter' etc. Set a proper plan where a regular babysitter is hired for regular hours.", "Feels to me like YTA. Your daughter put you in a pretty awful position. But she is your daughter, and you are involved in her life. You were pushing her to get the job, letting her stay with you, making judgements about her life choices.\n\nThe non-AH thing to do would be to have sucked it up, or to have gone and found child care, then talked to her about it when she got back warning you would get the police and child protection involved if she does this ever again. I cannot conceive of abandoning a 2 year old i was related to at a police station personally. The lack of love here is breathtaking.", "YTA. I understand your frustration but you should have given her a verbal warning that if she left him w you again without ur consent that u would turn him into the police. CPS can ruin lives, i feel you jumped to the most severe thing you could do first.", "YTA", "I mean, are you for real? I get that daughter was totally out of line but didn\u2019t you feel scared as his grandma dumping him at the police station and now he\u2019s been taken by CPS?

Shameful, since you're supposed to be the wiser and more mature one in this scenario.", "ESH\n\nYou daughter sucks for not taking responsibility for her own child, and putting that on you when you have made it clear you do not want that responsibility.\n\nYou suck because your daughter is 20. You let her move back in, with her son, who is a baby. Yes, 20 is an adult, but as her parent you had to realize what this situation would actually look like. If she can't afford to live on her own, and only works part time as of recently (which you admitted you forced her to do), how is she going to pay for a babysitter?\n\nTaking your grandson to the police was a big overreaction. You put your child's child into child protective services out of spite.", "YTA - handing your grandchild over to the police was a terrible thing to do.

In one action, you were able to ensure that you have lost any meaningful relationship with your daughter and grandson for the rest of their lives. As you enter in your twilight years, you will have plenty of time to reflect on it, as you will be spending those years without either of them in your lives.\n\nThat was a truly monstrous way to handle it. While you certainly needed to correct your daughter, make sure she is working, and find a balance within your home, I\u2019m actually struggling to find a worse way to handle it. You have now unnecessarily put your grandson in a fairly heartless system, and showed your daughter that you are absolutely not to be trusted.  Not only did you miss a huge opportunity to have some compassion, but you are showing that you are actually an antagonist. The fact that you did some thing so tremendously terrible and are still not quite sure if you did something wrong is impressively mind boggling.\n\nYTA, I hope those few extra hours of sleep are worth it to you.", "What did I just read \ud83e\udd23 you dropped your grandson off at the police station and said he was abandoned.

Or at least the majority of it. \n\nWhich is stupid if she decided to have a kid. And isn\u2019t in college or working.

That would\u2019ve sent the message loud and clear that the next time she does this, you\u2019ll embarrass her again so she and her baby daddy need to figure it out. There is an unfortunate reality that CPS is awfully underfunded in this country so there\u2019s always a chance that the kid could end up with someone worse or not any other family at all.

For a grandparent to do this to their own apparent \u201c loved ones\u201d is abhorrent, selfish to the extreme and quite frankly unforgivable.

It makes sure the parent has every opportunity to keep their kid safe, even if the parent is an asshole who has been ignoring you when you say no. Of course it's about not being taken advantage of, but it's just as much about making sure the child is properly cared for.\n\nTo do it like this with no warning, where there was no attempt to protect the child at all before taking it to this extreme, is so cruel.

If I was her daughter, I would never forgive her.\n\n*Shady Pines, Ma*!", "That or OPs expecting her daughter to hand her everything she makes as rent.\n\nLike, I'm eyeballing the ages here- a 20 year old with a 2 year old son was 18 at the oldest when getting pregnant, likely 17.\n\nI know it's not unusual for a teenager to get pregnant because teens are stupid but this is such a dramatic escalation that make's me suspect that OP may not have been the best parent either.", "ESH- you didn\u2019t need to actually take the child to the police station. I understand being tired and feeling forced to take care of someone else\u2019s baby. I understand being frustrated your daughter is shirking her responsibilities. I can\u2019t fathom escalating my frustrations that much in a sort period. Your daughter may lose her son. She sucks for her immaturity and lack of priorities but that doesn\u2019t merit losing her child unless there is context you did not include.", "I\u2019m literally in tears at the thought of that poor baby being scared and alone with strangers, wondering why his family abandoned him. Jesus fucking Christ.", "Yep and its not like mum is out clubbing. Shes working, trying to earn money to support herself and her son", "The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.\ud83c\udf4e", "I'm so very sorry. I can't imagine not showing my children how important they are to us. Stand up for yourself, cut contact with your mom if necessary", "I agree like yea it sucks that the hours and lack of child care options are, but like this is awful to do to the grandchild the mom is just working and really doesn\u2019t deserve this,  had they dropped grand child off at the moms work I\u2019d say ok but the police station and saying their abandoned? Wtf kind of ah puts a toddler through scary shit like that?", "> The only vaguely \"positive\" thing I could say to go with my ESH instead of that Grandma is the A H is that it sounds like her daughter does this a lot and doesn't seem to respect her mother's \"No\" at all.\n> \n> \n\nIt sounds like they are not communicating with each other at all on schedules.  Each needs to put their schedule on the fridge or something.  So they know when the other works and when OP's daughter comes home she needs to 100% take care of her son because it sounds like that's when OP gets to sleep.    \n\nDaughter should have told OP what days she works because it sounds like OP is her childcare for that.  And if OP works overnight tonight and her daughter works in the morning, they should be moving heaven and hell to make sure OP gets to sleep the evening before and the evening after.  \n\nESH, and reddit sucks too.  This is what happens when y'all on here every day telling people \"Next time they drop the kids off with you, report them for child abandonment.\"  I read it on here everyday.  Now someone's gone and done it, and here reddit is with the surprised pikachu face", "I took away a similar thought from this. Her daughter had the grandbaby at 18, \"forced\" her to get a job and then has to sprinkle in \"She did the best she could\" raising her kids and this isn't her problem. I wonder where the daughter gets these habits from? I mean the daughter needs to take some accountability and not just dump the baby on grandma but this is a massive overreaction. You were tired and annoyed so you dump a small child( your grandkid no less) at the police station creating a terrible situation all around seems downright cruel and heartless.", "As someone who used to do night shifts there's usually a good 2-4 hour period where you're fine before you actually need to sleep however I did that while 19-20 and OP is older so doing nights is going to be harder ok her, I don't think she's wrong for deciding not to care for her grandson however she is wrong for not taking him to a daycare or something instead of the police that's nuclear and completely uncalled for. Op had many other options and made the worst one.", "She\u2019s just cold hearted and frankly I\u2019d bet that being raised by her to start with was pretty dysfunctional.  Hopefully daughter gets a caseworker who can help her get into programs for housing, childcare subsidy, and any other stuff to help her get independent and allow her to not have to be relying on Grandma Dearest at all ever in the future.", "yep. mother of the year right here.", "There\u2019s a saying \u201cif you raise your kids you get to spoil your grandkids but if you spoil your kids you end up raising your grandkids\u201d and it sounds like the latter applies here.", "I worry that she might wound up losing him. She definitely would have to take time off work to go to court, which will likely result in her losing her job. A job that she will need to keep her child..", "She wasn\u2019t. You know how I know? She did this. No decent and I mean just barely passable parent would even think of doing this. I can\u2019t get over how gross this is. She may as well have said \u201cI\u2019m trash and hate my child  am I TH?\u201d Because that\u2019s what this post boiled down to.", "Exactly and if she couldn't afford to take time off to go to court, they would label her as an unfit and uncaring mother and take away her parental rights. She just can't win. This almost makes me wonder if OP wasn't waiting for an opportunity to do this hoping this would be the outcome.", "this!! this must be so scary for the poor baby :((", "I am WAY more sympathetic to the daughter, actually. Being 20 years old with a 2 year old is rough. And heck, it was OP that forced her to get a job while the kid still needed a caretaker. Maybe the reason OP's daughter wasn't looking for a job is because she was too busy taking care of her child. OP forced her to get a job which forced her into a difficult balancing act. Really, at this point, i really feel like OP  is at fault for creating this shitty situation in the first place", "If she was so tired how\u2019d she get the energy to take him to the police station? Much safer to stay at home than driving while that tired.", "I\u2019m wondering if before mom was forced to get a PT job if grandma has been footing the Bill for everything her daughter and grandson needed. \nIf so, then the daughter lacks the maturity, skills, and financial ability to raise her child. If not for grandma sacrificing what she already had the grandson could have been a CPS case before this and without her intervention.", "I\u2019m not saying someone sleep deprived should watch a kid. The mother of the kid is an asshole for not figuring something out sooner. But the reaction to a slap in the face is not dropping a bomb.", "Good I hope no one ever speaks to this woman again. This is beyond evil.", "Exactly that."]}
