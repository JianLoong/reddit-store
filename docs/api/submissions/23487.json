You were n-t-a up until the point you called the police.  That's where things turn on a dime.  You don't involve the police unless you absolutely have to, period.  Meaning, you should have warned your daughter at least several times before you took such a DRASTIC and DAMAGING action.  You absolutely have a right to not babysit your grandkid.  But you are horrible for putting your daughter and grandkid in that situation without exhausting all remedies.  You should apologize and, if possible, talk with CPS in order to smooth things over by suggesting there was a family misunderstanding that was caused by you.", "NTA. You said you didn\u2019t want to watch the baby and she wouldn\u2019t answer. At least you didn\u2019t leave it alone and went to bed.

You would rather have your grandson end up in foster care than actually talk to your child and parent her?\n\nI am a foster parent. The system is brutal and horrific and traumatizing.", "I can't call you what I'd like to call you, so I'll just say YTA. \n\nIt is never anyone's responsibility to care for another, however you must give absolutely zero shits about your daughter or grandson to do what you did. Asshole.", "YTA. You two should've talked things through and looked into a day care or other baby sitter.", "ESH Your daughter was young when she had a baby two years ago. Young adults aren't notorious for thinking things thru and considering the consequences. She needs to take responsibility for her child and as a parent. She needs to respond to the people who are watching her child. She disregarded your objection to her leaving her son without a sitter and she did it anyway. She didn't respond when you called and texted. You have your daughter no warning if she didn't take her responsibilities as a parent seriously next time she left her son with you over your objection, you would involve the authorities. Sadly now, this innocent child is in the custody of CPS because you two don't communicate well.", "INFO How much warning did you give your daughter that you weren't going to watch the baby anymore? From your post is kind of sounds like you had been doing it without complaint and just snapped yesterday.", "ESH: She shouldn't be expecting you to watch him. She made the decisions that led to the pregnancy and chose to keep the baby, so she gets to live with the consequences. Most people don't get free babysitting. She shouldn't expect you to provide free babysitting.\n\nHowever, you could have set this boundary much, much sooner rather than waiting like you did in this instance. You waited too long, didn't consistently enforce your boundaries, and then went to the absolute extreme when you finally decided to enforce it.\n\nThis boundary ideally should have been set before she even got pregnant. Just a simple, \"I will never watch your children for free if you get pregnant, so you will either have to pay me (and that's if I'm available) or figure something else out\", and then stick to it. Lots of parents do this up front before their teens ever even get pregnant, so It's a totally reasonable boundary to have. It just has to be stated and enforced from the get go.", "First, YTA for using the police to teach your daughter a lesson.

Honestly, if you had been clear and not let her live with you in the first place or been firm from the outset it might have forced her to find living arrangements where her baby didn\u2019t suddenly end up at the police described as abandoned.\n\nFifth, YTA for lying to the police about the child being abandoned. \n\nI could go on and on\u2026", "ESH.

You: you took your 2yo grandson to the police station and left him there for him to be taken away from everything he knows. I understand you're tired and it isn't your responsibility to look after him. But instead of abandoning him you should have sat down with your daughter and set up an actual plan instead of just having passing by 'I can't watch him, I'm tired', 'I don't have a babysitter' etc. Set a proper plan where a regular babysitter is hired for regular hours.", "Feels to me like YTA. Your daughter put you in a pretty awful position. But she is your daughter, and you are involved in her life. You were pushing her to get the job, letting her stay with you, making judgements about her life choices.\n\nThe non-AH thing to do would be to have sucked it up, or to have gone and found child care, then talked to her about it when she got back warning you would get the police and child protection involved if she does this ever again. I cannot conceive of abandoning a 2 year old i was related to at a police station personally. The lack of love here is breathtaking.", "YTA. I understand your frustration but you should have given her a verbal warning that if she left him w you again without ur consent that u would turn him into the police. CPS can ruin lives, i feel you jumped to the most severe thing you could do first.", "YTA", "I mean, are you for real? I get that daughter was totally out of line but didn\u2019t you feel scared as his grandma dumping him at the police station and now he\u2019s been taken by CPS?

Now that CPS is involved they will continue to be involved so I hope there\u2019s more to this\u2026 \n\nI\u2019m going with ESH because I just can\u2019t fathom someone doing this to their grandchild. He had to be scared to death.", "It's pretty easy to see the toxicity in this family. How is any of this reasonable to you? Your daughter's behavior is awful, and it's pretty clear she inherited it from you. Either you aren't intelligent enough to see that dropping off your own  grand baby at the police station is a ridiculous action,  or you are prone to overreacting and lashing out. Shameful, since you're supposed to be the wiser and more mature one in this scenario.", "ESH\n\nYou daughter sucks for not taking responsibility for her own child, and putting that on you when you have made it clear you do not want that responsibility.\n\nYou suck because your daughter is 20. You let her move back in, with her son, who is a baby. Yes, 20 is an adult, but as her parent you had to realize what this situation would actually look like. If she can't afford to live on her own, and only works part time as of recently (which you admitted you forced her to do), how is she going to pay for a babysitter?\n\nTaking your grandson to the police was a big overreaction. You put your child's child into child protective services out of spite.", "YTA - handing your grandchild over to the police was a terrible thing to do.

In one action, you were able to ensure that you have lost any meaningful relationship with your daughter and grandson for the rest of their lives. As you enter in your twilight years, you will have plenty of time to reflect on it, as you will be spending those years without either of them in your lives.\n\nThat was a truly monstrous way to handle it. While you certainly needed to correct your daughter, make sure she is working, and find a balance within your home, I\u2019m actually struggling to find a worse way to handle it. You have now unnecessarily put your grandson in a fairly heartless system, and showed your daughter that you are absolutely not to be trusted.  Not only did you miss a huge opportunity to have some compassion, but you are showing that you are actually an antagonist. The fact that you did some thing so tremendously terrible and are still not quite sure if you did something wrong is impressively mind boggling.\n\nYTA, I hope those few extra hours of sleep are worth it to you.", "What did I just read \ud83e\udd23 you dropped your grandson off at the police station and said he was abandoned.

Fuck. \n\nI remember reading how an OP\u2019s siblings would do the EXACT thing and people said \u2018call the cops on abandonment next time\u2019 and when it\u2019s done people call it CRUEL?! \n\nThis young woman needs to learn that she needs to get her shit together and figure out alternatives rather than take even MORE advantage of her mother.\n\nEdit: I am assuming due to the daughters lack of holding a job until forced, you were ponying up the financial burden for her and the child?! Or at least the majority of it. \n\nWhich is stupid if she decided to have a kid. And isn\u2019t in college or working.

Why didn't you say no I'm not doing it when she dropped them off? You didn't even give her a chance to make alternative arrangements you took her child away from her out of some fucked up spite and wanting to send some sort of horrible message that you aren't doing it anymore when a simple conversation would have sufficed!

Or because you normally are asleep during that time, you passed out while driving or something and weren\u2019t conscious while she\u2019s unreachable?

That would\u2019ve sent the message loud and clear that the next time she does this, you\u2019ll embarrass her again so she and her baby daddy need to figure it out. There is an unfortunate reality that CPS is awfully underfunded in this country so there\u2019s always a chance that the kid could end up with someone worse or not any other family at all.

If CPS does their job, she will get her act together!", "So this baby has to bear the brunt of this \u201clesson\u201d?", "Too tired to watch a toddler but not too tired to put him in the car and drive to the police station? That\u2019s much more dangerous", "Like others said:\nDrop him off at his mothers work or with a sitter. \n\n\u2026, the child is now in custody of the state. The mother pushed her to get a job and neither of them talked about child care.", "She didn't \"make herself uncontactable\" or \"ignore her calls\", she was at fucking work. Lots of people can't have their phone on them while at work, she probably wasn't able to check her phone until it was too late. Daughter was in the wrong, sure, but grandma is downright evil for the extreme action she took.", "1000000% agree", "I don\u2019t think OP originally even agreed to be the babysitter. Op came home from work and the daughter told Op they had to babysit, Op said they were too tired but the daughter just assumed OP would watch the grandson and made no other arrangements. \n\nSo this is definitely the daughter dumping babysitting duties on OP.", "You understand that she told her daughter that she was not able to watch her and the daughter left her kid with her anyway. She abandoned her child.", "If this was OP's regular shift, why would her daughter think she was available when it was time for her to rest after work.  She knew with plenty of advance time that OP was not available and left the kid anyway.", "Usually when people \u201chook up with abusive jerks \u201c it\u2019s because they were raised around abusive jerks or experienced abusive jerks in their life. That\u2019s what they know. I\u2019m sure her daughter chose to be a teen mom and got pregnant with a dead beat because she was modeled love and compassion judging by the lack of empathy for her grandson. \n\nIt\u2019s ok to not want to babysit and set boundaries of what you are willing and not willing to do when you allow your daughter to move back in. She traumatized her grandson to prove a point that could have been resolved and communicated in so many other ways. Poor kid.", "Omg judgemental as f**k !! You don\u2019t know any of that is true. What a warped way to view this situation, just because the daughter has a child with one arsehole does not guarantee a future of arseholes resulting in CPS becoming involved as a given in the child\u2019s future! For a grandparent to do this to their own apparent \u201c loved ones\u201d is abhorrent, selfish to the extreme and quite frankly unforgivable. Yes, helping raise your grandchildren is exhausting, time consuming, fraught with difficulties and compromises to navigate but the love, joy, pride and reward given by these little humans far far outweigh any perceived burdens. Shame on the grandmother and shame on you", "I doubt she loves him. If she did, she\u2019d be upset at not seeing him again; or does the think his foster family would be so determined to find grandma", "or at least given some warning before saying no if the mom was used to Op caring for the kid\n\nOP is N T A for not wanting to be a free babysitter anymore, but def is for how she went about it. \n\nMy heart breaks for that poor kid, 2 is old enough to kinda know what's going on and Im sure it's a traumatizing experience for him", "The mother went to work to her 8am shift from what OP said. Who hangs out at 8am? \n\nIt\u2019s not her responsibility to watch her grandson, but childcare should have been discussed when she allowed her to move back in or when she got the job.", "Protecting the child? The child is now in a foster home for who knows how long. Who\u2019s protecting the child now? She could\u2019ve taken him to his mother at work. She could\u2019ve told her daughter it\u2019s time to find a daycare or find a new place to live. Anything other than turning a toddler over to CPS.", "But now the kid is in foster care! How does that make her nta?", "Taking him to the POLICE STATION?!?", "I have a feeling that OP was the type of parent who told their kids to walk to school than complained if they were late", "The daughter was told she wouldn\u2019t babysit, she tried to force her to babysit. She should have gotten a sitter and this would\u2019ve been avoided. Seems like you\u2019re projecting", "Yeah non, take care of your fucking kids and stop pawing them off to people ! And get a fucking condom next time", "This!!!", "He is only 2 years old.  He will never remember", "It's funny, though, how when someone actually does tmwhatbrbjsbsub ALWAYS recommends evryone is shocked Pikachu face and how dare you...lol \nThis sub is so funny.", "I watched my grandson while my daughter in law was taking computer classes. One day while in the woods my boxer and her husky ran into my knee. Crushed my tibia plateau. I called her still on the ground to find another sitter. I would have dragged myself out of the woods for my grandson. OP is a vile person. Her daughter is irresponsible, but OP is next level. YTA", "Same. My MIL AND my mom. Both live in different states and if I called and said I needed them here asap to take care of their grandchild/ren, they\u2019d be here asap - no questions asked. Wtaf?", "my mil has been a sahm for 20 years almost (my my BIL is 16) and she has decided that being full time daycare for my 14m old while i try to find at least 2 days a week somewhere else (my husband has one day a week off so she\u2019s STILL doing 2 days regardless) is fine with even though she JUST got the last one to independence.\n\ni think she\u2019d light THIS WOMAN on fire just for saying this out loud let alone doing it.", "It stands for everybody sucks here in this story", "Equal shit heads or everyone sucks here. I prefer equal shit heads.", "Agreed, but grandma works overnight..", "My parents were almost never going to babysit, a lot won't. They don't have to either.", "If this was a continuing pattern, I could see giving warning about calling the police and then calling them. OP went from watching the grandchild to the nuclear option. Dropping the kid off at mom's work would have made the same point while keeping the two year old safe.", "That\u2019s what I was trying to figure out!! Like, if she\u2019s at work she CAN\u2019T answer the phone!! OP set her up to fail!!", "But the grandparent didn't agree to babysit; so mom did not take proper responsibility. \n\nThat doesn't mean that it's justified and ok to take the grandchild to a police station though", "It actually wouldn\u2019t surprise me if \u201cgrandma\u201d did this to make her daughter \u201cget rid of the kid\u201d \u2026 she doesn\u2019t seem to care at all that the child is now in foster care and her daughter lost custody.", "If I had any reddit coins left, I'd give you an award. I agree; the other cases were very different situations. It kept happening over and over again. In those cases, the OPs were very clear in stating \"If you drop the child off at my house again, I will call the police and report child abandonment.\" In one of the cases, the OP's brother would drop the kid off outside the apartment and drive away. He didn't even know if the OP was even at home.\n\n\nIn this story, OP was cold and calculating. She went to the police station as a first option, and doesn't seem to care that the two year old was taken away.", "Also, in a lot of other cases, the person leaving the kid for hours is doing so to party or be irresponsible. In this case, the mom was working. OP was determined that her daughter work, did they ever talk about daycare?", "It is highly unlikely that they Will place the kid forever into the system for one incident.", "She was told the grandmother would not babysit. She tries to force the grandmother to babysit. At that point you\u2019re arguing semantics", "So? That doesn\u2019t mean she has to watch him. The entitlement", "Unfortunately, while I sympathize with the child, OP is not the parent. OP communicated why they could not watch the toddler for 8 more hours. OP needed sleep. The parent made the choice and if OP was a roommate and not the grandparent, I feel people would have a different opinion.\n\nWhy must OP further be denied sleep when they clearly stated they could not watch the child. Parent still felt like taking advantage because this is family not a roommate. It makes no difference the person said they could not and still left a child with an adult that could not stay awake for much longer.\n\nThat is abandonment. The one who forced the consequences is the daughter not the grandparent.", "Brother does 10hr night shift. When he gets back, he has 1hr/hour and a half before he is dead asleep. He does what he needs to do, shower, cook a meal. Sundays he goes to church in the morning when he worked overnight on Saturday. \n\nHe would drive to church after getting changed from home. Go to church for the hour and then crash once he got home.\n\nHe can do it because he would be awake for a short while longer 2 hours more, not a full 8 hours.\n\nIt can be done and I'm sure OP knows thier limits before sleep comes.\n\nI understand what you're saying, but I also referenced my knowledge with my brother.", "He is only two.  Not aware enough of anything to get traumatized.", "Exactly this, they should've talked about it. I totally get not wanting to babysit after a long shift, but what she did went way too far.\n\n\nI hope the kid is doing okay", "Except this situation was totally foreseeable on her part and she should have told daughter she would likely be tired so she could make alternate arrangements instead of springing it her on her last minute.", "What would you do? Call off work to get rest that you lost? \n\nPay for your grandsons babysitter when the mother is fully capable of working but is just lazy?", "Would McDonalds with the cashiers and cooks be better? Or people that uphold the law and know how to navigate shit like this", "Can you envision any other way in which the grandmother could get out of (apparently) perpetual child-care duty, a task which she didn't care to assume?  She was not obligated to do this unwanted burden.  Her entitled daughter thought she could foist the task upon her mother.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Edit: rephrase for clarity)", "It also could\u2019ve been avoided with better communication and not taking your grand baby and abandoning him at the police station", "So it\u2019s fine for the kid to be scared because he won\u2019t remember it? Is it fine for babies to be hurt because they won\u2019t remember it, also? \n\nThat\u2019s a pretty disturbing comment you\u2019ve made there. \n.", "It is pretty clear why the daughter is such a poor parent. Look at that poor girl's example.", "Thanks, figured something along those lines.", "It should be everyone's shitty though I feel it fits the theme if the sub better l", "That is what I was thinking. It sounds like she gave no warning. But grandmother came home from work at 7 AM and was tired, yet told she had to babysit all day?\n\nThe police couldn't locate her daughter, so I expect she was not at work where she should have been? \n\nOP is still young enough to be working and cannot provide daily childcare. This is tough but maybe the child would be better off in foster care. He isn't getting the care he needs at home. \n\nI don't know the answers and feel awful for the poor child who is caught in the middle. Maybe this is what the mother needs to get her life together. \n\nI am not going to criticize the grandmother because there could be a very long, painful story here and we don't know all the facts.", "Seems like it was a long-standing agreement until grandma suddenly changed her mind. With literally minutes to leave the house, seems like mom was blindsided and chose to stack up her money so she can leave sooner than later.", "She complained about her working, she complained about her not working. The girl has been living there for only a couple of months, so she needed a place to stay for the time being, and the first time grandma was inconvenienced, she got her grandson that she supposedly loves taken away by the state. This is sick.", "The fact they already refuse now, says a lot. One day, is one day too much knowing rape and abuse cases. Grandmother feels no love for her grandchild at all. She is just as bad as the mother.", "What was she supposed to do? Call out of work so her mother can complain that she\u2019s not doing anything? Then it would be an argument about her needing to work to get herself together and potentially being kicked out on the streets with a two year old. She was wrong but that would never justify the grandmother\u2019s actions.", "I didn\u2019t say that", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how it works but also that baby\u2019s not getting back to his mom anytime soon", "Trauma can affect children in infancy, but whatever\u2026", "No, I would take him to my daughter at her work. You don\u2019t involve the government anymore than you have to in your family matters. Her daughter was an asshole but her grandson ending up in foster care is WAY worse. \n\nShe is asshole of the year for this! I can\u2019t believe ANYONE is defending this shit?!?!?", "How about to where her daughter works if anywhere. I bet you make an awesome problem solver smh doing some critical thinking may help.", "not let them live with her. Not agree to babysit \"while the daughter works but not 24/7\" then say she's not babysitting just one hour before the work shift.", "Grandmother is the adult in this situation, because it deals with her child, and her child's child.\n\nWhen you're \"the adult\", you have to make mature and smart choices, or live with the consequences of those choices.\n\nOP's daughter is 20 years old, the father of her child is not in the picture, and she had no where to live and no job. In what reasonable world did OP think opening up her home to her daughter meant that no additional responsibility would be added onto her? If she did not want any part of this, she should not have invited her daughter to move in with her.\n\nThere were ways to go about this other than the daughter dropping the baby on the bed and leaving, and for the grandparent to take the child to the police station.", "What communication? She did communicate and her daughter chose to ignore what she was saying", "I don\u2019t disagree with you, but if she feels like her daughter will never stop, this is what it takes. It\u2019s not safe for a sleep deprived person to care for a 2 year old. It\u2019s also not fair to not be able to reach the mother at all. Both mother and police tried. She did this to herself", "Grandparent didn't agree to watch the child, daughter left her child there anyway. Grandparent called / texted daughter, who didn't respond (who doesn't answer the texts / calls of someone who is caring for their 2 year old child!?).\n\nThere's a lot of ESH going around; but at the end of the day the daughter is her son's mom. It's her job to make sure he is safe, and cared for, which she didn't fully do here. The grandparent is also the parent of the daughter, even though she's an adult she is still someone's child that they should be caring for, and I find it hard to believe the only way to teach your adult child \"I'm not your babysitting option\" is taking your grandchild to the police station.", "Yes actually. If the grandmother can\u2019t fully watch the kid because she\u2019s so tired, the child is in danger. It\u2019s on the MOTHER to schedule a babysitter or stay home and risk the job, rather than risk her child\u2019s safety", "These are things people need to think about BEFORE having kids\n \nThey're called consequences", "Daughter knew well in advance", "At the bare minimum, grandma could have dropped him off at moms work - but the POLICE STATION? Way too far. ESH.", "You aren\u2019t wrong but like I said to someone e else \u2014 drop the baby off to mom\u2019s work then. The daughter isn\u2019t innocent, she\u2019s an asshole too. The only victim here is that poor baby", "Except this had been the arrangement since she started working and one day the grandma said I don\u2019t wanna do it anymore. Which is fine. But give the daughter some notice. \n\nAnd the first thought that comes to grandmas mind is to take the baby to the police and lie saying he was abandoned. Like wtf. How do you do that to a toddler?", "I\u2019m tired, I\u2019m gonna tell you right before your shift that I can\u2019t watch your child, but you still got to go to work. The child should always be safe with the grandmother. If she knew her child\u2019s safety would be at risk, she wouldn\u2019t have done it. It was more a betrayal from grandma than anything.", "But she had the kid. A grown woman compared to a teenager, and the grown women with life experience behind her decides to hurt her child and grandchild out of pettiness and it\u2019s somehow okay because the girl gave birth. Ok.", "There is zero indication that daughter knew she would say no in advance at all nevermind well in advance.", "I don\u2019t disagree with that either. I would assume that\u2019s what grandmother would have done if the daughter had picked up her phone, but I don\u2019t know. I definitely feel terrible for the baby", "OP said in the post \"I am tired of being forced to watch my grandson against my wishes in my own home\". Unless OP posted somewhere in the comments, my understanding is that the daughter has been having OP watch her child, and OP has never been ok with it and the daughter just keeps doing it (which is why I went with ESH and not YTA). Clearly taking the baby to the police is a huge overaction and not appropriate", "You have no clue how long before her shift the daughter was told. It doesn\u2019t say it in the post, so you\u2019re speculating to make yourself feel right", "Looking at it you\u2019re right, but there\u2019s also zero indication that she didn\u2019t tell her in advance. So we\u2019re both wrong", "Yeah. Ugh. My heart breaks for him!", "It literally says their work hours. Grandma gets off at 7, mom goes in at 8. That\u2019s maybe 20 minutes in between to tell your child they need to find another babysitter.", "She could\u2019ve told her before the shift is my point. You don\u2019t know so don\u2019t speculate", "It literally says it. That\u2019s no time."]}
