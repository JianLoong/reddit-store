You were n-t-a up until the point you called the police.  That's where things turn on a dime.  You don't involve the police unless you absolutely have to, period.  Meaning, you should have warned your daughter at least several times before you took such a DRASTIC and DAMAGING action.  You absolutely have a right to not babysit your grandkid.  But you are horrible for putting your daughter and grandkid in that situation without exhausting all remedies.  You should apologize and, if possible, talk with CPS in order to smooth things over by suggesting there was a family misunderstanding that was caused by you.", "NTA. You said you didn\u2019t want to watch the baby and she wouldn\u2019t answer. At least you didn\u2019t leave it alone and went to bed. I wouldn\u2019t expect someone who worked an overnight to watch my kid", "YTA. You would rather have your grandson end up in foster care than actually talk to your child and parent her?\n\nI am a foster parent. The system is brutal and horrific and traumatizing.", "I can't call you what I'd like to call you, so I'll just say YTA. \n\nIt is never anyone's responsibility to care for another, however you must give absolutely zero shits about your daughter or grandson to do what you did. Asshole.", "YTA. You two should've talked things through and looked into a day care or other baby sitter.", "ESH Your daughter was young when she had a baby two years ago. Young adults aren't notorious for thinking things thru and considering the consequences. She needs to take responsibility for her child and as a parent. She needs to respond to the people who are watching her child. She disregarded your objection to her leaving her son without a sitter and she did it anyway. She didn't respond when you called and texted. You have your daughter no warning if she didn't take her responsibilities as a parent seriously next time she left her son with you over your objection, you would involve the authorities. Sadly now, this innocent child is in the custody of CPS because you two don't communicate well.", "INFO How much warning did you give your daughter that you weren't going to watch the baby anymore? From your post is kind of sounds like you had been doing it without complaint and just snapped yesterday.", "ESH: She shouldn't be expecting you to watch him. She made the decisions that led to the pregnancy and chose to keep the baby, so she gets to live with the consequences. Most people don't get free babysitting. She shouldn't expect you to provide free babysitting.\n\nHowever, you could have set this boundary much, much sooner rather than waiting like you did in this instance. You waited too long, didn't consistently enforce your boundaries, and then went to the absolute extreme when you finally decided to enforce it.\n\nThis boundary ideally should have been set before she even got pregnant. Just a simple, \"I will never watch your children for free if you get pregnant, so you will either have to pay me (and that's if I'm available) or figure something else out\", and then stick to it. Lots of parents do this up front before their teens ever even get pregnant, so It's a totally reasonable boundary to have. It just has to be stated and enforced from the get go.", "First, YTA for using the police to teach your daughter a lesson. They have better things to do.\n\nSecond, YTA for leaving a TWO YEAR OLD with a bunch of strangers with no thought of how frightening that might be to the child. \n\nThird, YTA for not considering the possibility that your grandchild could have been taken away by child protective services for something like this, and that you would have then been responsible for long-term messing up the child\u2019s relationship.\n\nFourth, YTA for not communicating with your daughter better. Honestly, if you had been clear and not let her live with you in the first place or been firm from the outset it might have forced her to find living arrangements where her baby didn\u2019t suddenly end up at the police described as abandoned.\n\nFifth, YTA for lying to the police about the child being abandoned. \n\nI could go on and on\u2026", "ESH. Your daughter: she needs to grow up and take some responsibility for herself and her son. You: you took your 2yo grandson to the police station and left him there for him to be taken away from everything he knows. I understand you're tired and it isn't your responsibility to look after him. But instead of abandoning him you should have sat down with your daughter and set up an actual plan instead of just having passing by 'I can't watch him, I'm tired', 'I don't have a babysitter' etc. Set a proper plan where a regular babysitter is hired for regular hours.", "Feels to me like YTA. Your daughter put you in a pretty awful position. But she is your daughter, and you are involved in her life. You were pushing her to get the job, letting her stay with you, making judgements about her life choices.\n\nThe non-AH thing to do would be to have sucked it up, or to have gone and found child care, then talked to her about it when she got back warning you would get the police and child protection involved if she does this ever again. I cannot conceive of abandoning a 2 year old i was related to at a police station personally. The lack of love here is breathtaking.", "YTA. I understand your frustration but you should have given her a verbal warning that if she left him w you again without ur consent that u would turn him into the police. CPS can ruin lives, i feel you jumped to the most severe thing you could do first.", "YTA", "I mean, are you for real? I get that daughter was totally out of line but didn\u2019t you feel scared as his grandma dumping him at the police station and now he\u2019s been taken by CPS? Your daughter is TA for doing that but that was really, really heartless and cold of your as grandma to him. Now that CPS is involved they will continue to be involved so I hope there\u2019s more to this\u2026 \n\nI\u2019m going with ESH because I just can\u2019t fathom someone doing this to their grandchild. He had to be scared to death.", "It's pretty easy to see the toxicity in this family. How is any of this reasonable to you? Your daughter's behavior is awful, and it's pretty clear she inherited it from you. Either you aren't intelligent enough to see that dropping off your own  grand baby at the police station is a ridiculous action,  or you are prone to overreacting and lashing out. Shameful, since you're supposed to be the wiser and more mature one in this scenario.", "ESH\n\nYou daughter sucks for not taking responsibility for her own child, and putting that on you when you have made it clear you do not want that responsibility.\n\nYou suck because your daughter is 20. You let her move back in, with her son, who is a baby. Yes, 20 is an adult, but as her parent you had to realize what this situation would actually look like. If she can't afford to live on her own, and only works part time as of recently (which you admitted you forced her to do), how is she going to pay for a babysitter?\n\nTaking your grandson to the police was a big overreaction. You put your child's child into child protective services out of spite.", "YTA - handing your grandchild over to the police was a terrible thing to do. Yes she should have find another sitter, but that child was not neglected or abandoned. \n\nDo you have ANY idea of how bad the system is for children? You did that to an innocent 2 year old.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

She probably won't try that crap again.  Your claim that she abandoned the kid was totally accurate.   Hopefully you'll encourage her to find a place to live.", "Do you have no love or connection to your grandchild? Just thinking of the poor child as the only person he knew walked away from him while surrounded by strangers is heartbreaking.\n\nYes, your daughter did a shitty thing, but then you escalated it beyond reason and with no thought like Putin. \n\nOf course YTA.

Children do not do better in foster care.", "ESH. Your daughter does not sound like a responsible parent. You purposefully got your grandchild put into foster care. This child deserves so much better than the two of you plus the deadbeat.", "ESH. I feel bad for the 2 y.o.", "YTFA\n wow, thanks dad.", "The daughter made her bed she should lie in It is not up to her mother to take care of her baby she did the right thing is better that that child be in a situation with its cared for in a abandon consistently by its mother. I mean it\u2019s messed up she had to do it but it\u2019s not her responsibility and her daughter needs to know there are consequences to your actions.

If I worked an overnight and was exhausted then had someone fail to accept I COULDNT watch a living being, then I\u2019d do the same. The kid is gonna be better taken care of unless you think the mother is doing a good enough job lol. Grandma set her boundaries", "Totally agree with this take. And yes ESH!", "she's lost access to her child, so you're right she probably won't do it again. So cruel. I can't imagine ever doing that to a child.", "she did not have to take a 2 year old and leave them with the police. That was cruel to the 2 year old."]}
