TLDR; I told my BF of 10 years I wasn\u2019t ready to buy a income property. He brought it up to friends while at dinner and got pissed when I called him on it later.\n\nI set up a dinner meeting with a long term friend, who\u2019s a realtor, to catch up and hang out. She said she had some business to discuss with my BF as they are both into investing in property. \n\nWhile on our way to dinner my BF told me that I should buy an investment property\u2026. I point blank have told him prior to this that I was not ready, so, I again reiterated to him that \u201cI am not ready..\u201d I gave him examples as to why, which includes but not limited to helping pay for my children\u2019s college tuition.

I excused myself and I was Coming back from the bathroom I caught the end of a conversation between the two of them about me investing. \n\nI sat down and listened to them for a while on the merits of it and what is available to help me obtain it. I politely engaged and again said \u201cI\u2019m not ready yet\u201d My friend totally got it and dropped the subject, her tact and grace is immaculate. However, my BF did not. After she left he continued on that subject again. That was until I started to push back on his views, saying he\u2019s not listening to me when I say no. \n\nIt got heated.. I was not about to go silent on my counterpoints related to my current financial situation.

He followed me to the truck and we left together without saying a word the entire ride home. \n\nHere\u2019s where I think I\u2019m the AH\u2026. \n\nOnce we got home I tried to talk to him about what happened and how it made me feel. Keep in mind it was fairly civil no screaming or yelling, I sat across the living room from him. We went back and forth and I had to take a moment outside to clear my head when I felt overwhelmed. When I came in we continued to argue about how events went, I continued to express how it made me feel (embarrassed/disrespected) and how he\u2019s not apologizing for the perceived slight.

He clearly doesn\u2019t care to consider your situation. That makes me wonder if he\u2019s too hard up to just go get one on his own, and if that\u2019s the case, why would he want to risk ruining both of your finances, leaving you both with nothing but huge debts and a property you\u2019d have to unload at a huge loss?", "NTA\nHe\u2019s not respecting your decision. I\u2019d be miffed too. Why is he pushing so hard? What would it benefit him?", "NTA - you seem to be looking forward with logic, your BF somehow seems invested in YOU buying property.  Take a look at why HE wants YOU to invest in something you think is a bad idea at this time.  To me seems like a walking red flag, especially walking way at the end.  \n\nYou have been with him for 10 years, do you really want to be with someone who has no concern for what YOU want for yourself and instead seems determined to push HIS agenda onto you???", "NTA.\n\nYou have good reasons to want to go low-risk with your finances, so he should not interfere.\n\nHeck, even if you wanted to not spend money on his pet hobby just because you wanted to buy a giant turd and paint it gold, then that is still your business.", "Does he want you to buy a house with him or by yourself?  The reason why I am asking is that one is more absurd than the other and trying to see how nuts this guy really is. \n\nI understand wanting to give a person good financial advice but buying a home is one of the biggest investments you will ever make and should not be done unless you are completely ready for it.  \n\nI think he was being a dick whatever his intensions were.  To make it worse he disrespected you in public. this is a conversation that should have been done at home and not in front of people.  I would demand an apology and if he can't see what he did was wrong then I don't know what else to say. \n\nGood luck OP and NTA", "NTA\n\nThis is a red flag city!\n\nTalk to your friend and ask if she knows why BF was trying to encourage you to buy an investment property so badly.  My guess is that he wants to buy a property but doesn't have the credit or down payment or something, but he could qualify if he could convince you to be on the mortgage with him.  If he planned to convince you that \"you\" should buy an investment property and then segue that into \"we\" should buy a property together, your refusal to consider it would have wrecked his plans which explain his tantrum.\n\nDon't buy anything with this guy, don't give him money, and don't have joint accounts.  Something is going on with his finances and you don't want to be embroiled in it if the relationship ends.", "NTA - it sounds like there is more to this than he is letting on. He has an angle or agenda that he is not sharing and it sounds like he is looking to benefit for himself by YOU investing. \n\nBased on the information you provided you have clearly and repeatedly expressed that you are not ready to buy an investment property. Also it sounds like your friend / realtor had already been aware of your BF interest ?? Does he already have investment property ?? Has he been discussing it with your realtor friend ?? Seems odd that she would have some business to discuss with him otherwise. \n\nI know you are together for 10 years but I am concerned that there is something going on that he is not telling you for him to be SO INSISTENT on you buying into his idea. If you have any joint accounts - make sure there is no way he can access the funds needed to operate on his own and rope you into it without your knowledge or consent. His behavior seems very off. That he will not let it go after you have repeatedly told him NOT NOW, is very concerning. That he doesn\u2019t recognize that he is completely disregarding and disrespecting you is alarming.  RED FLAG!! \n\nSomething is very wrong here and I\u2019d say be on your guard. Do some careful assessment of all your accounts. Have any new insurance policies been purchased ?  Sadly I\u2019m not joking. \n\nThat he won\u2019t apologies and fails to see where he is wrong in this is screaming self interest and disregard for anything but his own interests. \n\nBe careful.  Consider this relationship carefully. This can\u2019t be the only flag for concern.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
