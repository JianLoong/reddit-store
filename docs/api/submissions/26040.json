If you are doing so great as a Dr, you should be able to get the mortgage on your own without her help.", "YTA.

There is no way in hell I'd pay over twenty grand to wind up with nothing.", "If you want the house to be in your name only, then buy it without her help.

If she is living with him, the remaining living expenses (food, utilities, contents insurance, car payments if the co-own a vehicle, fuel etc) are split 50/50 until such a time that she is included on the mortgage or they get married and the property becomes marital property.\n\nWe don't know what his current contribution to the deposit is, so it's hard to make a call on that. Even if his contribution is $0.00 though then her 4% stake is still 4% of the current value of the property. He just has a few mortgage payments until his contribution is equal to or greater than hers. In the event that the relationship dissolves then her payout on the property would be greater than his based on equity.", "This.

They don't give out mortgages unless all title holders sign before a notary. They just don't sign that they are responsible for the mortgage payments.\n\nIANAL but if you're not married I think it would be a terrible idea to give her title but no responsibility to pay. If you split up this could get messy. You don't want her to have the house and you have to pay the mortgage.\n\nThe way you take title matters too, and varies with the locale (joint tenants, tenants in common, joint with right of survivorship). Messy messy messy.\n\n\n\nYou're doing it right.", "What percentage of the downpayment is her $22K? If it's as much as or more than what you are contributing to the downpayment and closing costs , then yes, she should be on the title unquestionably.\n\nIf it's significantly less than what you are contributing, then, there still needs to be some kind of legal document that protects her $22K buy-in and her future equity in the home based on that buy-in, should the two of you ever split up. It would be unwise of her to contribute to the purchase of the home without some kind of agreement and acknowledgement that her contribution gives her part ownership.\n\nSo... YTA because you are taking her money, and there's a finanacial advantage to both of you to not have her name on the mortgage - yet you want the ability to leave her high and dry if the relationship goes south.

Never mind that this is affectively a re-post from a few months ago with only the genders changed- any agreement for repayment should they break up, would likely be considered mortgage fraud. In most cases a lender is likely going to require a gift letter from any funds not originating from the purchaser- and drafting an undisclosed agreement to counter that is fraud.", "This is critical information. Thank you! \n\nI didn\u2019t see the post a few months ago.", "INFO: Did you both seriously consider actually putting her on the title and mortgage right now? It kinda feels like you're creating a false ultimatum which is actually a decree by making her name on the title conditional on something that is possible, but that you've already rejected and refuse to consider.

Don't even think about it.", "Do not put her name on the title.  Draw up a contract that allows her to make payments (keep in mind most payments are mostly interest and don't actually affect the balance that much, in other words a $1,000 payment might be $800 in interest and $200 in equity early in the loan life.  So a $1,000 payment nets $200 ish in ownership equity).\n\nThe point is, if she's on the title she owns 50%.  She doesn't need to put a penny in.  That's 50% of your down payment equity, that's 50% of every payment you are making.  If you break up she could end up forcing you to sell to get her half out.\n\nIf you get married or add her to the will she gets the house if you stay together for the rest of your lives, so there's no issue with her not being on the title in a happy days scenario.  What you are protecting for is a end of relationship scenario.\n\nShe should build equity based on her real world financial contributions, nothing more, nothing less.", "NTA and no no no.
