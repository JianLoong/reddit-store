So I am twenty-five years old, from Oklahoma, recently, I moved to a new town due to an unexpected passing in the family, which means I am now staying in a motel until I can find a place to live, which I have found a place, a two bedroom apartment, just a couple miles away from the motel I am staying at. This is where my so called friend comes in, we will call him Entitled Friend, because if you tell him \"no\" about something, he will have a full tantrum, at the same time, I can't really blame him, his parents are the ones that taught him to act that way. \n\nNow, Entitled Friend has never, and when I say never, I literally mean not once in his life has he ever had a job, he has never even picked up an application. Sorry, it seems like I am ranting, this is just confusing me. So, he contacted me earlier this week asking if he could move in with me, and I immediately shut that down telling him quote; \"Why would I let you move in with me, when you refuse to work, all you do is party, get drunk, and sleep, and you are more destructive than my dog.\" (Husky by the way, his name is Lightning). \n\nLet's just say, he did not like that response, and he had a melt down, and now my girlfriend, among some other friends keep on calling me the jerk because of what I said. But, before you judge, keep in mind, I did give this friend a chance once before, and I ended up evicting him, for the exact some reasons as I mentioned to him; the late night parties, getting drunk, destroying the house/apartment, then sleeping all day. \n\nThe reason I know he has not changed, is because for some reason my best friend, we will call her Jasmine is dating the guy, and I know she can do a lot better. But I am going to stay out of that, their relationship is their business, but she talks to me about the things he does, because I am the only person she can talk to, aside from her parents.\n\nSo I leave it to the strangers on the internet to judge? AITA for not allowing my Entitled Friend to move in with me and for telling him why even though it may have been harsh?\n\nP.S. I could go on for days about this guy and his entitled behavior, however, I decided to keep it short and simple for this specific incident.", "created_utc": 1667788356, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yoabcp/aita_i_wont_let_my_friend_move_in_with_me/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What is being judged is whether or not I was to harsh, because I have some family and some other friends telling me that I was way too harsh, while others are telling me, that I only said the truth, and if the truth hurts, that is too bad. \n\nNot going to lie, I feel like I may be wrong, but I am getting mixed messages.
