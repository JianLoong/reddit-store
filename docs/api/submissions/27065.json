You are an AH for allowing this to continue until they were 19. You should have pulled their licenses when they were 17 and screwing around while driving. Driving is a priviledge. NOT a right. Pull them from your insurance, revoke access to your cars and tell them the only thing you will do is pay for a defensive driver class for both of them. And hold to that.\n\nDo not let them drive your cars. Pull them as drivers off your insurance and run a MUCH tighter ship with your younger two. Insist they do full drivers education - the class, the driving instrution, etc... it will be FAR cheaper in the long run then all the damage your older two have caused.", "NTA\n\nThey are adults and are not behaving responsibly in their driving habits. That has consequences they need to face. Paying their own insurance is a good way for them to see what their bad habits are costing them.", "NTA. They're adults. Time for them to grow up.", "Nta", "If the cars are in your name, transfer the title to their names. If they get in accident and damage property or injure someone, you will be on the hook financially and could be sued into oblivian.", "Where do you live that someone can rack up 80 speeding tickets and still have a license?", "NTA they\u2019re old enough to pay for their own car insurance. Maybe it\u2019ll teach them to be less wreck less since it\u2019ll be now affecting their pockets.", "YTA.... not for taking them off your insurance (NTA for that) but for allowing them to take the piss out of you!!! \n\nThey have been driving reckless for too long and are capable of seriously injuring themselves, or worse, someone else!!! They need their license revoked!!! \n\nYou're doing the right thing by making them pay their own way. They need to grow up and learn because their behaviour is so unsafe. I hope your younger to have more sense than this", "Are the cars registered in your daughters names or yours? If in yours transfer titles now!!!", "I think there is probably some nuance here. On one hand, I fully understand that they are adults and if they can't drive responsibly then you don't want the liability. At the same time if they are driving around uninsured that can create very serious problems for them and I'm not sure I would want to put my kids in that position. That said, if you offered to help them find individual policies and they declined, I'm not sure there's any more you can do. I think maybe you are being a little bit of an asshole but your daughters are being assholes too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Got to be a fun story there.\n\nNTA.", "OP, I may be a little too Gen-X for this discussion but this has gone too far already and it\u2019s time for the hammer to come down.  Insuring any teen is insanely expensive, let alone two in the current market. My car insurance bill with two college students is more than my first mortgage. \n\nYour children do not have enough fear of consequences or respect for their privilege. One infraction is understandable but they have taken advantage.", "NTA. What else could you do?", "NTA\n\n>They both work and have been paying for their respective policies since they were 16 with PT jobs.\n\nNow they can pay for individual policies.", "Yeah. I\u2019m not repeating this with the younger two. We literally can\u2019t afford it.", "This!\nI wonder if OP is waiting for one them to get badly hurt or to hurt someone else", "80 MPH + \nI corrected it.", "Not anymore", "They both got new individual policies asap.

My god- when does the blame game stop when it comes to entitled adult children?", "And if they drive around recklessly while insured with OP they can create very serious problems for the rest of their family. Like, being told that the family as a whole might be uninsureable if this behavior continues is no joke. At some point, \"but what if they have an accident while uninsured!?\" stops being their parents' problem. They are 19, they earn their own money, they should be able to suss out insurance. And if not, they had their talking tos, and if talking doesn't work dealing with the consequences of their actions might actually stick.", "Then pay for the younger two to take drivers education and defensive driving.\n\nSit them down and have a serious conversation about car use, car safety, how it is a priviledge, NOT a right. Draw up a contract with them about expectations and the consequences of actions:\n\n1 - speeding ticket? They lose driving priviledges for a month\n\n2nd speeding ticket - they lose driving priviledges for 3 months. and have to work to pay for a defensive driving class.\n\n3rd speeding ticket - they lose access to the car.\n\nAccident that is not their fault - there is forgiveness.\n\nAccident that IS their fault? They pay for the raise in deductible, they pay for the car repairs...\n\nYou need to teach responsibility. You let the 19 year olds down there - you allowed them to get away with their behavior without consequences.", "Under 18 we had consequences, clearly they weren\u2019t severe enough. A lot of this happened after they turned 18. I can\u2019t revoke their license then. There are only so many options over age 18.", "Thank goodness \ud83d\ude05 I was afraid of the lawsuits you could of been opened too.  Especially if in the US", "Great ideas.", "No but you can revoke access to your vehicles. You knew they were being reckless and yet you still let them drive your cars.", "We did take away access multiple times. We should\u2019ve done it permanently in hindsight!", "Still can. Do you own the cars? If they don\u2019t get insurance and the car is in your name your liability is gigantic. Are they paying for their own college, housing and expenses? If no you do have a lot of leverage to penalize their dangerous behavior. Quit shrugging it off and saying \u201ceh, we\u2019ll do better with the younger ones\u201d", "They pay for 100% of their own expenses, totally independent. They live on their own. The cars are in their names (they also bought the cars themselves and have always paid the insurance since day 1). They also pay for their own college and dorm/apartment. I have no more leverage/control over the 19yo\u2019s to take anything away except taking them off our policy so we have zero ties to the choices they make while driving. \n\nWe did have consequences from 16-18 but nothing seemed to get through to them, not revoking their license, not grounding including phone, not making them pay for damages or pay tickets OR doing driving classes, nothing worked. When I thought we were past the reckless behavior after consequences, they would do it again. So here we are, removed them from the policy. I made good on my promise that this would happen if they continued. \n\nI could\u2019ve sold their cars when they were 17 and taken their licenses away if I knew how bad it was going to get. But again, a lot of this happened over age 18 with the cars in their name. (I should\u2019ve taken them off the policy sooner to reduce my liability.)\n\nTheir individual rates are now $100-200 more per month.  So ig they were fine with paying for tickets and wrecks that affected the whole family\u2019s rates and could possible get us sued, but not their own policy. They\u2019re mad. \n\nWith my younger two we still have control over the driving privileges, that\u2019s why I say I can only control what happens to the younger drivers at this point. I can only learn from this. I do plan on making stricter rules thanks to all the advice here."]}
