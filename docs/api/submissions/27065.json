You are an AH for allowing this to continue until they were 19. You should have pulled their licenses when they were 17 and screwing around while driving. Driving is a priviledge. NOT a right.

When I thought we were past the reckless behavior after consequences, they would do it again. So here we are, removed them from the policy. I made good on my promise that this would happen if they continued. \n\nI could\u2019ve sold their cars when they were 17 and taken their licenses away if I knew how bad it was going to get.

You did let them slide with this for way too long, but good on you for finally putting your foot down. However, this behavior as a whole is very concerning, even for 19-year-olds who sometimes tend to act before thinking because technically they are still children.

GOod lord", "Before you take them off your policy, make sure they are insured because they could wind up driving uninsured if you don't. And that could be a much bigger liability than you want.\n\nAnd, have them shop around to find out what their individual policies will cost them, or if they can even get them.", "NTA but I fell like the second twin is the only obvious A for obvious reasons. Looking at the first twin I think more info is needed so I\u2019ll go through the topics.\n\nFirst I\u2019ll skip the speeding and darting and go to driving other people\u2019s cars and letting them drive yours, I looked this up and according to permissive use if the owner of a car specifically allows someone to drive it then the insurance will still insure them as if they were the owner. This is probably for groups of people who car pool to bars with a DD who isn\u2019t the owner of the car, I thought this might be a Texas only law but I saw this on an Allstate website so I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s nationwide or majority of the nation. \n\nSecond are the 2 accident, not at fault means that the insurance won\u2019t care about it so I won\u2019t care about them either. Third are parking tickets and if they\u2019re strictly parking tickets which I assume is the case then insurances again don\u2019t care about it so as long as she is paying for it I won\u2019t care about those either. Note that they need to be paid off in a reasonable time or there will be a trickle down effect from the courts to the insurance company which will raise the rates eventually.\n\nFinally i\u2019ll go back the the first part of speeding and darting through traffic, this is gonna depend on the driving culture of where you live and on how you\u2019ve viewed the speeding and darting. If you\u2019ve only been able to see if first hand in the car then there\u2019s a decent chance that she appeared to be driving faster than she actually was based on studies and blind tests about how ride height and car volume effect your perceived speed.( to summarize a lower car is seen as going faster than it actually is by drivers with their instrument cluster covered and the same for louder cars so a loud low car will seem like it is going faster than it actually is) darting can also be swayed by the type of car as from my personal experience sitting in the passenger seat of a sports car feels a lot more wild than what the car is actually doing so changing lanes from the right lane to the middle lane to pass someone then a second or two latter switching to the third lane to continue to pass can feel a lot more aggressive than it actually is (this is assuming pausing in the middle lane for a second and actually checking to make sure you are clear). This is all from the first person in the passenger seat, if you are following her going somewhere in a different car then you would have a more accurate gauge of how reckless her driving is, so if you observed the driving as opposed to experienced it then your conclusion about her driving is right. \nThere is also driving culture which depends on where you live and the easiest example I can think of is driving in Houston Texas vs crossing the border into Louisiana where in Houston the gap between the slowest 20% of drivers and the fastest 40% of drivers is probably 30 mph and the drivers are generally thought of as more on the reckless side while Louisiana will have your heart dropping when you pass a state trooper behind a highway billboard. This is an extreme example but in some places driving what would be considered more aggressive in a \u201cLouisiana\u201d is natural for your average driver in a \u201cHouston\u201d\n\nI would say that the same general principles apply your other twin but that only effects the driving her friends cars and other than that it\u2019s a pretty clear and cut case that she\u2019s a bad driver. And this is assuming that the 80+ mph speeding ticket was by the second twin and the letting boyfriend drive was by the first twin (which means that the insurance agency wouldn\u2019t have anything to go on other than a driving tracker to increase rates based on the first twin). To wrap things up best case scenario is twin one being a \u201cambiguous\u201d driver and twin 2 happened to be a bad apple which happens sometimes so you shouldn\u2019t feel bad at all in terms of teaching them how to drive. Worse case scenario is that twin 1 thinks she\u2019s the second coming of baby driver and something is most definitely wrong in the magical teaching formula which is also understandable to have happen as you can\u2019t expect to teach someone to drive perfectly by the age of 19 on the first try. Back to the actual topic, they would\u2019ve needed their own insurance policies at some point and now the middle man has been removed so they will probably be fine with the new setup.", "Take the cars.  Hide the keys.  Canceling the insurance is just inviting trouble. \n\nWhat if they cause an accident?  You could be on the line for THOUSANDS.  This is just so irresponsible", "We did the same unless you\u2019re saying your kids had individual policies. They bought their own cars and paid their portion of their insurance on the family policy since they were 16. Dads a mechanic so he helped fix their cars but made them pay for parts. This all seemed to have a positive affect until they got close to 18.", "\n\nThe fact that you're still making this about the money shows you still don't fucking get it.  Your kids could kill themselves or someone else.  Ffs.", "I understand why you made the decisions you did. 80% of adults speed, have gotten parking tickets, and have been involved in some kind of accident once in their life. Unfortunately teens are more predisposed to all of these things\n\nOn the other hand I understand why Reddit is coming down so hard on you. There's a difference between \"I slowly hit a beam in a parking garage pulling out of my space\" or \"I got a ticket for driving 65 in a 60 zone\" and \"I had open alcohol containers in the car\" and \"I was driving 80 in the rain in a 55 zone\". You ultimately have to draw the line at what actions constitute \"learning curve\" (though of course part of learning is paying) and which ones are literally putting people's lives as risk. Alcohol is generally a removing car privileges permanently kinda thing, so...there's that.\n\nBut of course nta for booting them off the insurance. Sounds like the consequence was delayed but it's about time", "I will tell you what my parents did, bc i love them and think they were smart for it. They got me my first car. It was a complete junker, barely got me to school. And they said, if i can drive that and avoid any wrecks, any speeding tickets and prove i was a good driver, THEN they would buy me a nice car and put me on their insurance after a year of driving. I had to prove myself first, though, and i thank god for that every day because i have never even had a ticket in 8 years of driving now", "I look a defensive driving class before I got my car saved me literally from a couple of wrecks/ accidents over the years, might consider a refresher course.", "You might also offer to pay for lessons down the road if they aren't ready right away. 16 is too young for a lot of people (including me) to be driving.", "\ud83d\udcaf", "Too little too late.\nMy bet is that they\u2019ll choose to drive without insurance.  When one inevitably gets pulled over and the car is seized, DO NOT rush in to get the vehicle out of impoundment.  Let them lose their car!  They won\u2019t need it anyway as they\u2019ll likely lose their license.", "Wait until they kill someone driving drunk, you think insurance is expensive but the legal fees will bankrupt your family. You've been disgustingly negligent this far, fix it now.", "Lost 4 friends in highschool to a drunk driver in the same crash.\n\nYTA OP for letting them do this for this long. \n\nPull thier insurance and access to cars.
