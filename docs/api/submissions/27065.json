You are an AH for allowing this to continue until they were 19. You should have pulled their licenses when they were 17 and screwing around while driving. Driving is a priviledge. NOT a right.

On one hand, I fully understand that they are adults and if they can't drive responsibly then you don't want the liability. At the same time if they are driving around uninsured that can create very serious problems for them and I'm not sure I would want to put my kids in that position. That said, if you offered to help them find individual policies and they declined, I'm not sure there's any more you can do.

Like, being told that the family as a whole might be uninsureable if this behavior continues is no joke. At some point, \"but what if they have an accident while uninsured!?\" stops being their parents' problem. They are 19, they earn their own money, they should be able to suss out insurance.

They lose driving priviledges for a month\n\n2nd speeding ticket - they lose driving priviledges for 3 months. and have to work to pay for a defensive driving class.\n\n3rd speeding ticket - they lose access to the car.\n\nAccident that is not their fault - there is forgiveness.\n\nAccident that IS their fault? They pay for the raise in deductible, they pay for the car repairs...\n\nYou need to teach responsibility. You let the 19 year olds down there - you allowed them to get away with their behavior without consequences.", "Under 18 we had consequences, clearly they weren\u2019t severe enough.

There are only so many options over age 18.", "Thank goodness \ud83d\ude05 I was afraid of the lawsuits you could of been opened too.  Especially if in the US", "Great ideas.", "No but you can revoke access to your vehicles. You knew they were being reckless and yet you still let them drive your cars.", "We did take away access multiple times. We should\u2019ve done it permanently in hindsight!", "Still can. Do you own the cars? If they don\u2019t get insurance and the car is in your name your liability is gigantic. Are they paying for their own college, housing and expenses? If no you do have a lot of leverage to penalize their dangerous behavior.

The cars are in their names (they also bought the cars themselves and have always paid the insurance since day 1). They also pay for their own college and dorm/apartment. I have no more leverage/control over the 19yo\u2019s to take anything away except taking them off our policy so we have zero ties to the choices they make while driving. \n\nWe did have consequences from 16-18 but nothing seemed to get through to them, not revoking their license, not grounding including phone, not making them pay for damages or pay tickets OR doing driving classes, nothing worked. When I thought we were past the reckless behavior after consequences, they would do it again. So here we are, removed them from the policy. I made good on my promise that this would happen if they continued. \n\nI could\u2019ve sold their cars when they were 17 and taken their licenses away if I knew how bad it was going to get. But again, a lot of this happened over age 18 with the cars in their name. (I should\u2019ve taken them off the policy sooner to reduce my liability.)\n\nTheir individual rates are now $100-200 more per month.  So ig they were fine with paying for tickets and wrecks that affected the whole family\u2019s rates and could possible get us sued, but not their own policy. They\u2019re mad. \n\nWith my younger two we still have control over the driving privileges, that\u2019s why I say I can only control what happens to the younger drivers at this point. I can only learn from this. I do plan on making stricter rules thanks to all the advice here.", "NTA.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works with my kids (21 and 16): you get a ticket, you pay for it. You drive in a manner that results in my insurance going up, your car, which is in my name, is taken away from you, and you are off my insurance policy. When you purchase your own insurance policy, I will sell you the car that I took back from your for a fair price if you want it. I made it clear up front that the car was not a gift, it was my car I allow use of, and as such, is subject to being taken away.

You will wind up paying for it so much more than premiums after a crash. Please realize the limits of insurance, in my state someone living in the house (students legal address is often home and not school) crashes a car they weren\u2019t insured on and it voids the policy.
