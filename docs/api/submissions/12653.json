There\u2019s no reason for you to respect someone who has done everything to not deserve it. Also he called you a brat first. Don\u2019t throw a punch if you can\u2019t take one.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s a cheating asshole and that\u2019s how many people are going to see him. I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t like being reminded of that fact. Tough shit.", "NTA it seems like you were very patient and tried to remain respectful but distant. Your uncle just didn\u2019t want to be called out on his bullshit.", "NTA \n\n\nYou\u2019re totally within your rights to not go. That\u2019s a pretty sad situation. You probably shouldn\u2019t have resulted to insults, but if I were in your shoes I would\u2019ve done the same thing.", "NTA. The adulterer and his affair partner deserve no consideration from you or anyone else.", " NTA\n\nYour uncle seems very immature", "NTA. To use the language currently in vogue, an invitation is not a summons. You eloquently stated your position on the matter, and your uncle chose to drag the discussion down to an exchange of insults with a 14-year-old. Just to be clear, your uncle\u2019s fianc\u00e9e is not \u2018cheap\u2019\u2014she came free with a full tank of gas.", "NTA. I like that you\u2019re supporting your aunt.  People shouldn\u2019t be pretending that his engagement is good and normal.", "NTA good job sticking by your morals.", "NTA It's common for cheaters to be pissed when they're called out on it.", "NTA You're only 14, you shouldn't even have to be involved in this situation. Your uncle and his fiancee are terrible people.", "NTA. If he didn't want to hear what you said, he shouldn't have cheated.", "NTA. Uncle cheated, he should expect some backlash. I think that you shouldn't tell him to his face though. You did the right thing and stood by your convictions and your aunt. I think it kind of stung for the uncle, since he probably liked you, but I don't think you two were ever going to have a good relationship anyway. I just think that maybe you could have just lied to him and say you couldn't go or something. I think you should just have stated you were hurt by his actions. In my opinion insulting his girlfriend is a dick move, though she did do something pretty effed.", "NTA. That's a quality moral compass you have there. Top self.\nWhile, as you say it devolved into an argument, you handled declining the invite with as much grace as anyone has reason to expect from a 14 year old.\nYou added some brutaly honest commentary that they, as people, do not meet your standards.  In what was probably one of your first peer based conversations with your Uncle, that takes a lot of self-assurance. \nStay the course as you've picked one that can only serve you well in life.", "NTA\n\n(1) is he or his wife related to your parents?  If it is his wife, then he had amazing nerve going near the house.  If it is him, then his poor wife has a small support structure and he is working to destory that.  If you go and 'welcome ' wife No.2 , it means you lied to her all the time you supported her\n\n(2) He barged into a house he doesn't live in, demanded you go, gave you dress code instructions and then insulted you when you told him he was a lying cheating sack of trash\n\n(3) he was too late with his 'I don't want to see you again' because you got there first\n\n(4) your parents are for some reason trying to keep him content so there must be something else at play.\n\n(5) any woman that shows up is condoning his cheating so she shouldn't be upset or look for support when it happens to her.  If the family condone cheating then of course it will happen.\n\nOR you could go to the event and dress against the dress code\n\nOR you could not go to the event and send a Strip-O-Gram to congratulate the couple\n\nOR you could CANCEL the reservation (which would be a touch evil)", "NTA - we need more teenagers like you holding shitty adults accountable", "NTA an invitation is not an obligation. Actions have consequences, and it's time for this middle-aged man to learn that.", "NTA\n\nBro he cheated on someone you really care about and hurt her severely, that alone is enough to exclude him from your life. But then he goes and barges into your house without permission and expects you to play along with him as though nothing is wrong..and WITH the person he cheated with?? Heeeell nah. You had every right to be upset and he shouldn't have expected you to play nice. Doesn't matter if it's family or not, we can only put up with so much.", "NTA", "NTA OP.  Your uncle is, though.", "NTA. If more people lived the moral beliefs they claim they adhere to, the world would be a better place. \n\nBonus-you don\u2019t have to interact with the adulterers.", "NTA - he's a cheater and if he can dish out insults then he should also take them.", "NTA. I personally think your response was gold \ud83e\udd47", "NTA. He didn't want to be reminded of his cheating, and definitely not by a \"moody teenage brat.\"  He deserved everything you said to him. Well done for standing up to him!\n\nI despise cheaters. They aren't worth the space they take up.", "ESH. It's fine for you to have a moral code, but in the other hand you're absolutely being a moody teenage brat. The good thing about your uncle's relationship violating your moral code is that the relationship/party/engagement isn't about you. Nobody cares what a kid has to say about adult relationships. Shut up and go eat a free meal.\n\nOn the other hand, your uncle does sound like a real weirdo. I would be really embarrassed if I let my 14 year old nephew get me that worked up. I don't think it should matter that much to him if you don't want to go.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
