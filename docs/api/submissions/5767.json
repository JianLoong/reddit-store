As she lives across the country from her parents and couldn't do the travel this year, she was invited to come to my family Christmas instead. She has met my parents but it was her first time meeting most of my extended family. \n\nA couple of days before Christmas, we woke up to find her pet hamster had died in the night. She was really upset about it, it was a year old which I think is a pretty normal life for a hamster. She cried and didn't feel like doing anything for the whole day, which was fine. We even had a little funeral for it and buried it in our backyard. \n\nCome Christmas morning, my gf is still sad, doesn't want to wake up and have breakfast together or open presents. She said she couldn't enjoy it as she'd bought presents for her hamster and it was making her too sad. I told her I could take her to the store and she could pick out a new hamster as a present to cheer her up. She got extremely upset at this suggestion and started bawling, telling me I was being heartless, it wasn't something she could just replace. I started to get pissed off because at this point it had been 2 full days of this, and it felt a little bit performative. I left her alone so I could cool off.\n\nAt about 1, I went back to check on her, and she was just laying in bed on her phone. I told her she needed to start getting ready as we had to leave the house by 2 for Christmas dinner. I saw she was watching  hamster tiktoks, and I told her this was only making her more upset and she needed to get up right now or she was going to make us late and embarrass us. She started shouting at me and said she wasn't coming to Christmas, that I shouldn't expect her to come when her pet had just died, that I was being emotionally unavailable. I said my whole family was expecting to meet her, they'd bought gifts for her. She said they'd all understand that she was just too upset to deal with everything. She claimed she would make a bad impression if she came because she was too miserable. I told her she was being utterly ridiculous, I know she's sad, but my family aren't going to take a hamster dying as a serious reason to miss the biggest holiday of year. I said she needed to get ready to go and there would be no further discussion. \n\nShe ended up coming, but we were late. I thought everything went fine. Afterwards, my mother sent me a message saying my girlfriend didn't seem herself, and asking was everything alright. My girlfriend saw the message and lost it at me again, saying this was exactly what she was worried about and now my whole family would hate her.\n\nI really am at a loss for what to do at this point. It's been a couple of days now and the fight is not resolved. I really don't think I was in the wrong but she is extremely hurt and says I am being a \"psycopath\". \n\nTL;DR I took my gf to Christmas dinner with my family after her hamster died the other day.

Jeez dude. I'm going to go with YTA even if I think this is why hamsters make kind of bad pets in general.", "YTA.  You might not think a dead hamster is the end of the world.  But your girlfriend really loved the rodent, and needed more time to come to terms with his passing. \n\nThis issue wasn't really about the hamster.  It was about a young lady who was not in the proper mindset to be meeting the boyfriend's family, but you made her go anyway.  \n\nYou can think she was over-reacting, but that does not matter.  She shouldn't have been made to leave home until she felt ready to leave home.", "Yo! Your hamster probably wasn\u2019t dead! Hamsters get buried all the time from going into a hibernation that is very similar to death.", "Not to be morbid, but just in case she decides to get another hamster\u2026are you sure the hamster wasn\u2019t hibernating?\n\nhttps://www.veterinary-practice.com/article/is-my-hamster-hibernating-or-dead", "YTA, I don\u2019t know why you were so concerned with them meeting her because I doubt she will be your gf much longer.", "Replace hamster with cat/dog/horse/some other animal in this story. Does her reaction seem more understandable now? Just because it's just a hamster to you doesn't mean it was the same for her. YTA.", "Everyone grieves differently, regardless of what loss they've experienced and what day of the year it is.\n\nYou were insensitive suggesting to replace her pet to try to minimize her grief.\n\nYou were pushy and self-centered by verbally browbeating her to force her out of bed.\n\nAnd wow were you seriously out of line giving her that craptacular \"no further discussion\" nonsense! \n\nCalling her grief \"performative\" to try to make yourself sound less assholey here really just puts a fine point on exactly how much YTA.\n\nClearly you didn't understand how attached she was to her pet and you did nothing in the moment to actually try to be understanding. You attempted to minimize her grief (and you're still doing so to try to appear less assholey). You showed her you thought she was ridiculous and then actually told her she was. And you were more concerned with potentially being embarrassed than her not feeling up to meeting lots of new people... I really don't see how you could be in any genuine doubt that YTA. No wonder she called you \"emotionally unavailable\".", "YTA. Losing a pet is very similar losing a friend. Imagine if one of your best friends died and she told you to get over two days after. If it'd been over a week and she refused to leave the house over a pet dying you might be in the right, by 2 weeks completely right, but two days? Heck, I randomly cried for a month when my favorite chicken died. You should have at least told your family prior she'd just lost a pet. You seem to completely lack any sympathy here, she's completely right. Anyone who disagrees has clearly never lost a pet.\n\nOn another note, hamsters are the worst pets possible. Every time I hear about one it's about them either dying tragically or being the actual devil. Kinda funny from an outside perspective.", "YTA for your lack of empathy, YTA again for pushing when another adult tells you \"no\".", "Hey also make sure the hamster is dead. They can hibernate if it gets cold enough like the temperature everywhere got. I\u2019d dig it back up today tbh just in case.", "YTA and who TF do you think you are, telling another grown adult \"there will be no further discussion\"? If my boyfriend spoke to me that way, ever, he would be alone very fast.", "YTA. You have no right to dictate how someone mourns.", "YTA her reaction was big, but everyone handles death differently. It wasn't right to try and force her into a large social gathering with new people when she was still in the early stages of grieving.", "You were definitely insensitive to her needs, whether or not you think it was a big deal it's clearly something she's struggling with. My cat is everything to me I feel like it would take me more than two days to feel up to a big social gathering if I were to lose him.\n\nIt reminds me a little of a similar situation. My dad runs a small business and one of his employees had her guinea pig pass away and she took 2 weeks off because she was too sad to work. He called me absolutely dumbfounded for perspective asking whether or not people actually get that attached to guinea pigs haha he gave her the time off because he's a good boss but I do think he needed me to bounce his frustration off so he didn't accidentally tell her he thought it was ridiculous.", "YTA\n\nDo I fully understand that level of sadness over a hamster no - do I have to understand her grief to make it  real also no. She can be as sad as she is.\n\nAnd she set a boundary that you yelled her into changing she didn't wanna go you forced her and belittled her sadness... That is on you.\n\nYour being an A .", "YTA- but don\u2019t worry, with a little luck you\u2019ll have a new girlfriend by next Christmas to bring.", "Holy shit youre the asshole. YTA YTA YTA im not sure why you think you get to dictate anything to another grown ass person.", "YTA and your failing to see the point that even she knew she wouldn't have been good company.  Instead of letting her stay and just explaining to your parents you put her \" reputation \" or worry of it ahead of her own feelings that makes you an AH . Looks like she will be mourning having a  boyfriend soon too !", "YTA. If it was a dog would you have been more understanding? She loved that hamster like one would any other pet and you basically told her she was wrong for grieving.", "YTA.\n\nHer pet meant a lot to her, and her grieving should be a priority. You really need to work on your empathy, otherwise this relationship is doomed (although I think you already ruined it)!\n\nTo many people, pets are *friends and family members*, and she just lost it!\n\nYou forced her into a situation where she had to put her FRESH GRIEF aside and \"function\" for your comfort, selfishness and entitlement.\n\nWhen you can\u2018t even realize that you\u2018re an AH now after posting this, you really don\u2019t deserve her and should do some inner work before entering a relationship ever again.", "YTA for prioritizing social expectations over her feelings. People have the feelings they have. It doesn't do any good to tell them they're unreasonable to have those feelings or to try to rush them to get over their feelings. By telling her your family wouldn't care about her \"excuse\", you further invalidated her feelings.\n\nWhat you could have done was invited her to still come, but to be open with your family about what happened and how she was feeling. Based on how your family reached out to check if she was okay, I'd guess they'd be supportive. If you'd done that, your girlfriend might start to see your family as a support structure, not an obligation who you portrayed as poised to judge her for excessive grief.", "Woooooooooooooow, you seem like you\u2019d be a real hoot in a crisis Mr. Get Over It Police. Just because her hamster wasn\u2019t important to you, doesn\u2019t mean it was not a friend and family member to your GF. \n\nA simple \u201ca beloved pet of my GF\u2019s died suddenly two days ago and she\u2019s not feeling up to a celebration, she extends her deepest apologies and was vey excited to meet everyone\u201d would have sufficed in this situation.\n\nFYI, hamsters live 2-3 years so this was was a premature death. YTA.", "YTA - Grief is not something that can be directed. I once grieved for a kitten I never even had in my possession (I was supposed to go pick him up and a day before he fell from the roof and they had him euthanized without informing me). If you have an emotional bond with something, regardless of whether it's a human who lived to 90+ or a hamster who has the life span of around 2,5 years in captivity, the loss of them can be hard to take.\n\nShe was definitely not in the right mind set to meet your family and they noticed. You could have told your family something happened and that your gf couldn't come. No obligation or reason at all to go into detail on why she couldn't come. Personal emergencies are personal and your family isn't privy to that. \n\nMaybe after a while she'll want a new pet, but trying to replace one so shortly after the loss of the first one IS insensitive to someone who has formed a bond with their pet.", "YTA. You did nothing to 'help'; your primary concern was how things would look and avoiding any 'embarrassment'.", "YTA.\n\nThis may be important to remember: *you don't get to dictate how someone else feels*.\n\nIs it excessive to mourn so hard for a hamster that you can't leave your room for 3 days and miss Christmas?\n\nProbably.\n\nIs it your place to say so?\n\nNo.\n\nShe gets to decide how her pet's death affects her. If that causes you to go off her a bit, that is your right. If you want to make the suggestion to \"go to the dinner anyway, and everyone will understand you're not feeling cheery because your pet died, but they'll appreciate that you came anyway\" then good for you, but do it gently.\n\nBut don't tell her that her feelings are invalid because it's only a hamster. Or try and tell her that watching hamster videos won't help. You have no idea what the critter meant to her and you are not here to rate her grieving process.", "I think it's more ESH\n\n1. Big family events can not always be rescheduled - especially if it's coinciding with a national holiday. \n\n2. A death in the family is a valid reason not to feel up to going to a large family event.\n\n3. It is a perfectly acceptable thing to go to the family event, and tell them that she is grieving but didn't want to miss the chance to meet family. \n\nThere is a way of handling her grief and the family obligations without stressing out or being an AH.", "YTA \nIt's a really tough situation, everyone reacts differently when a pet dies. Some people get really attached and describe it as feeling like they lost one of their closest friends. You weren't supportive or there for her in the way she needed. I dont understand people's grief about their pets either but I try to do the right thing about it even though I have never understood it. If you approached the situation differently it could of changed the outcome but you were a little dismissive of her feelings. I dont believe she should of missed the family event for it. But getting defensive over it definitely isn't what you should do. Apologise to her, and maybe ask her if she wants to talk about the hamster and show you photos or videos of her/him.", "YTA for the way you handled it. Had you shown a bit more tact or sympathy, she may have been more receptive and feel a bit better about the situation, but you weren\u2019t supportive. \n\nYour intentions with the replacement hamster may have been good but it is a very bad move to suggest that someone\u2019s beloved pet is so easily replaceable, even if you think it\u2019s \u201cjust a hamster\u201d. \n\nThe way you told her what to do was pretty rough as well and I\u2019m not surprised she reacted poorly to your actions on Christmas. \n\nWith some communication this situation seems salvageable to me", "YTA but only slightly because of how you handled things on Christmas Day. I agree with you it is is 100% ridiculous to want to skip Christmas dinner because a pet hamster died. BUT Your not her dad- \u201cI told her\u2026she needed to get up right now or she was going to make us late and embarrass us.\u201d \u201cI said she needed to get ready to go and there would be no further discussion.\u201d This is how you talk to a child , not your partner. I know you were really frustrated with her but think a different approach would\u2019ve served you better. Ex- gf I understand that you\u2019re heartbroken, this holiday is really important to me and my family and I really want you by my side, I know it will be hard for you and I\u2019ll support you however I can. Something like that. Not demanding she get up and go.", "I\u2019m not going to vote either way, and she should\u2019ve been allowed to stay home, but\u2026 dang, that\u2019s a lot of reaction from a 22yo. Pet loss grief impacts me for a long time, but you have to deal with it while going to work, continuing to raise children, caring for other pets. You don\u2019t just stop living. He was a jerk, and she became comatose with grief. Neither party is right.", "\"I said she needed to get ready to go no further discussion\"\n\nYTA for this. Look I agree, a hamster is a minor thing but she was upset and your reactions were just making it worse. She probably already had the pressure of meeting the rest of your family while not spending it with your own and if she said she didn't feel comfortable going then she didn't feel comfortable going. Forcing her, \"leaving her alone to cool off\" wasn't going to make things better", "ESH.  You shouldn\u2019t have forced her to go, you should\u2019ve left without her.   As for her, I mean, we\u2019ve all lost pets, but a hamster of one year, days later and she won\u2019t get out of bed on Christmas is a bit much.", "Your girlfriend's hamster dies after 1 year. Life expectancy is 2-3 years. That's like a human dying when they're 30. So that hamster died very unexpectedly. And your girlfriend takes that to heart. Some people are more sensitive to it than others. Instead of giving her space, the solution is to replace that hamster. You don't say to someone who has lost his dog: \"then you buy a new one\".\r  \n\r  \nYou could have made all sorts of excuses why your girlfriend wouldn't go to Christmas dinner after saying she wasn't emotionally ready.

You were ok until you offered to go get a replacement. It doesn\u2019t work that way.\n\nI will say though, as much as I love my pets, it\u2019s not the same level of grief as when I lost a parent. I really worry for people who get so immersed in grief for a pet you know has a 1-2 year life expectancy. I think your gf probably needs to learn some coping behaviours.", "Idk man sounds like she needs therapy to me", "NTA she's 22 not 12 but clearly needs to grow up", "NTA  what is this thing with people, it was a hamster who has a lifespan of up to 3 years maybe a little more.  She is being a drama queen \ud83d\udc51  she needs to grow up and talk about her feelings, nothing wrong with mentioning at dinner my hamster died, get a bit of sympathy and learn to deal with death.  It is really not healthy to be acting like this, mental health is important but we have to look after our own mental health and not put ourselves in situations  which make us feel worse like laying in bed moping.  Apologise for invalidating her feelings but mention you are worried about her and your mum  probably was 2.  Take her out of house, walking/fresh air and talking about future pets will help and of course let her talk about hamster, maybe even get her a framed photo of him/her to hang in home.  Good luck", "NTA and quite frankly she sounds like a really toxic person that believes everything should revolve around her and her emotions.\n\nI get that she's sad, and she had every reason to be upset but you were doing her a very kind favor by inviting her to your family Christmas.", "NTA... If she cannot conduct herself appropriately after a hamster's death how will she react after real issues throughout life. This is telling.", "You\u2019ve done nothing wrong here but I wouldn\u2019t go as far as to say your GF ITA in this story.", "NTA\n\nI get that she was attached to the animal for a year, but for a small as little as a hamster, she shouldn't be this upset. It wasn't a child.\n\nFor this being the first time meeting your extended family, her staying behind would've been worse then showing up in a sad state of mind. She should have out a on poker face, and showed up \"happy & jolly\". \n\nI think you did the right thing regarding offering to buy her a new hamster, they're small pets, easy to manage and replace when their time comes. Transitioing from one to the other shouldn't be an issue, even with something as small as a hamster. \n\nI'd talk to her, recommend that you still think you're right and that she's over reacting. If she still maintains the mindset that you're in the wrong on this, I'd say pack your bags and move on. Little situation like this can be a flag for what's to come over something more serious. \n\nAgain, **NTA**.", "ESH - You shouldn't have forced her to go when she was miserable. Just go by yourself and explain that she isn't feeling well. \n\nBut, your girlfriend could have at least gone and explained she wasn't going to be herself because she was grieving, then your family would hopefully more understanding", "You're not TA for dragging her out of the house to Christmas dinner. Getting out and around people can be a good thing while you're grieving, to keep you from spiraling.\n\nBut YTA for suggesting someone replace their pet a day after it had died and for thinking that someone being sad their pet had died for 2 days is \"performative\" to the point where you had to leave to cool off. Even if you didn't care about the hamster, she obviously did. She bought it Christmas gifts for goodness' sake. Have some empathy, or else don't date people who get attached to pets if this is how you'll react.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But something as simple as a white lie of \u201cshe\u2019s not feeling well\u201d (she was emotionally drained probably and grieving) would\u2019ve probably sufficed and you could\u2019ve attended still.", "I think you handled this really poorly. \n\nWhen someone experiences a loss you don\u2019t have a say in how sad they are about it.

Additionally, as has been studied, spending time re-experiencing grief can be very unhealthy.  Generally speaking it's best to stay busy and not re-traumatize yourself.  I can't speak to how you handled this situation but ultimately you were trying to remind her to do the adult thing and to continue to be part of not just your life, but the life of your family.  You (and your family) have made a clear investment in both of your futures.  The expectation is that she will be present and able to interact and make a good impression, and show that she is equally invested in that future.  \n\nIt sounds to me like she has poor coping skills and doesn't take her obligations to you or your future together seriously.

But someone who never had a pet until adulthood, it might have caused her to bond more closely, and thus have a more intense reaction to it. \n\nIt was two days, if it was a pet she was close to (maybe a gift from her family who she barely sees so for her it might have been the one connection that she lost now) I can get that up to three days. \n\nThe poblem here is how her boyfriend tried to handle things, which caused her response to spiral more out of control actually.", "It's been two days and she's clearly upset. If this was a dog would you be expecting her to be \"over it\" by now?", "It's been two days and her pet just died. Have some basic sympathy", "He wasn't inviting her. They had already planned to go so she could meet the extended family. Then this suddenly happens and her emotions are raw and she's afraid of not making the right impression at that point (regardless of whether you think it's an overreaction to the loss of a pet, you can't control grief). And then he told her, as if she were a child, that there'd be no discussion and she was to come with him to a place full of new people while she was not in the right headspace.  \n\n\nIt was not a favour. It was an obligation so he wouldn't be embarassed (his own words).", "You think she\u2019s the toxic person who believes the whole world revolves around her in this equation??? \n\nYou sound like someone who concludes that catcalling a woman is actually a compliment and therefore the subject woman should be grateful for the attention\u2026.", "He told his girlfriend who's pet died two days earlier that she needed to get over it now because that'd been long enough. How is that not an AH move?", "Because you weren't helping. Helping is realizing what someone needs and then providing that. In this case she needed to be alone and work through it on her own. You trying to help by forcing her to do things outside of her current comfort zone was not helping.", "Oh heaven forbid she be upset longer than 24 hours about the passing of a pet.\n\nYTA let her deal with her grief how she wants.", "In case you didn\u2019t know, hamsters can enter hibernation if it gets too cold.

I get that you might think a rodent can't be that important in someone's life, but it was for your gf. She needs time to grieve. \n\nShe was angry at you because you didn't respect her feelings. You weren't even trying to do, since you think no one can be that sad over a hamster. Maybe you thought you were helping her, but you didn't. YTA.", "It wasn't about her feeling better. It was about the impression she made on your family.

Unless her boyfriend is a real AH.\n\n\" This was Christmas day and it was a really big deal. Everyone knew she was coming and I don't see how laying in bed would make her feel better.\"\n\nSo dragging her to a function she didn't want to go to was supposed to make her feel better?!?!?!?    Good God man...I think you're lucky you still have a girlfriend.", "It's not a big deal that it's Christmas day. It \\*was\\* a big deal that she'd meet them for the first time, and she could still have done that on another date. \n\nSomeone's death can't be foreseen.

I'm not in the mood to go meet my in-laws and will tell them something personal came up and I can't make it but want to reschedule.

A need.", "simply tell them her pet had passed away, my family is huge and constant has new SO being brought in and met. you are making this seem like an huge event. it\u2019s not like you won\u2019t have any other family gatherings ffs. you act like Christmas is only a one snd done event. and it\u2019s always the \u201cwhat about my needs\u201d dude her fucking hamster died bffr", "You could have just told them she came down with a bug and wasn't feeling well.\n\nEdit typos", "Oh how could we be so stupid as to forget your manly needs are what takes priority here? A thousand apologies sir.", "I had never heard of this, not sure if she has. I will not be telling my gf because I don't want to give her false hope, but I think I'm going to dig him up to check.", "It's been a few days, if he was hibernating he will have suffocated by now due to being buried.", "The hamster would still have needed air. Hasn\u2019t it been days?", "Imagine having a pet and not knowing it\u2019s basic life habits. If she didn\u2019t know, that\u2019s her problem. People who get pets without doing research on them first are just the worst", "Also a hamster is a living creature. People form bonds with them. Them being a small rodent doesn't change the fact they're alive and their death does impact the owner", "The whole mindset around hamsters have changed. It used to be a 1st new pet for children that lived in a tiny cage and had a short life. Now it\u2019s a pet for adults that need to live in a large aquarium or diy hamster enclosure with bedding a min of 2feet deep. Seems like you and your gf have different values around pets. Some people are like this is my child or my best friend! They don\u2019t have the same hierarchy of importance as you do. I think seeing it that way might help you put it in better perspective. I think ESH b/c you\u2019re both seeing this through different lenses and I think she could have made Christmas happen.", "Yeah, OP didn\u2019t need to stay home with her", "No one said lie to the family? They said GO to the family even and TELL THEM she is mourning but didn\u2019t want to miss the chance.

It'd be cruel to bury him just to keep a petty secret for sure. And it'll help clarify for the future - which is why you should also still tell her if she does decide to get another, because it'll hurt her feelings but it'll prevent a similar mistake from happening again.\n\nBtw, I didn't weight in beforehand but I think a bit of ESH is in order. You shouldn't belittle her grief but she is handling it badly. I understand the grief in itself, but I wonder about her own emotional maturity if its \\*incapacitated\\* her in such a way. Up to you whether you want to explore that avenue (ideally in some form of safe environment, such as therapy) or not.", "We buried him in a shoebox though, with some flowers and a couple of his toys.

She\u2019s probably homesick and then her hamster dies.

She actually didn't need to do that. You wanted her to do that. There's a difference. \n\nShe didn't want to, because she was afraid of making a bad impression as her feelings were still raw, and she was right because they picked up on it. Now she feels even worse because apart from her losing her pet, she also feels she made a bad impression on your extended family and has the evidence (in her eyes) that that is the case.", "Just want to add that a hamster should live 2-3 years, not just 1x Hopefully you guys didn\u2019t have a funeral for a hamster that was alive and just trying to hibernate.

Your girlfriend obviously knows that she'd not make a good guest right now in her current state of mind and you forced her to attend in sub optimal circumstances to meet them for the first time. \n\nDepending on the family, they can actually find it more insulting to have a guest over who is not enjoying themselves and showing their best, than having them over regardless of the circumstances.

However, not having access to oxygen (due to being buried) is definitely not conducive to a living hamster.If left alone, hamsters will often hibernate for 2-3 days but if the temperature is very low then they may remain in hibernation for up to a week.\n\nIt takes minimally an hour in warmer (minimum of 68 farenheit or 20 degrees celsius) environment for the hamster to wake up from hibernation.If it was in a cage where the temperature dropped below 20 celsius it could have gone into hibernation and then you need to move them to a warmer spot."]}
