As she lives across the country from her parents and couldn't do the travel this year, she was invited to come to my family Christmas instead. She has met my parents but it was her first time meeting most of my extended family. \n\nA couple of days before Christmas, we woke up to find her pet hamster had died in the night. She was really upset about it, it was a year old which I think is a pretty normal life for a hamster. She cried and didn't feel like doing anything for the whole day, which was fine. We even had a little funeral for it and buried it in our backyard. \n\nCome Christmas morning, my gf is still sad, doesn't want to wake up and have breakfast together or open presents. She said she couldn't enjoy it as she'd bought presents for her hamster and it was making her too sad. I told her I could take her to the store and she could pick out a new hamster as a present to cheer her up. She got extremely upset at this suggestion and started bawling, telling me I was being heartless, it wasn't something she could just replace. I started to get pissed off because at this point it had been 2 full days of this, and it felt a little bit performative. I left her alone so I could cool off.\n\nAt about 1, I went back to check on her, and she was just laying in bed on her phone. I told her she needed to start getting ready as we had to leave the house by 2 for Christmas dinner. I saw she was watching  hamster tiktoks, and I told her this was only making her more upset and she needed to get up right now or she was going to make us late and embarrass us. She started shouting at me and said she wasn't coming to Christmas, that I shouldn't expect her to come when her pet had just died, that I was being emotionally unavailable. I said my whole family was expecting to meet her, they'd bought gifts for her. She said they'd all understand that she was just too upset to deal with everything. She claimed she would make a bad impression if she came because she was too miserable. I told her she was being utterly ridiculous, I know she's sad, but my family aren't going to take a hamster dying as a serious reason to miss the biggest holiday of year. I said she needed to get ready to go and there would be no further discussion. \n\nShe ended up coming, but we were late. I thought everything went fine. Afterwards, my mother sent me a message saying my girlfriend didn't seem herself, and asking was everything alright. My girlfriend saw the message and lost it at me again, saying this was exactly what she was worried about and now my whole family would hate her.\n\nI really am at a loss for what to do at this point. It's been a couple of days now and the fight is not resolved. I really don't think I was in the wrong but she is extremely hurt and says I am being a \"psycopath\". \n\nTL;DR I took my gf to Christmas dinner with my family after her hamster died the other day. Now she's shitty with me and calling me a psycho.", "created_utc": 1672143036, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zwe94u/aita_for_taking_my_gf_to_christmas_dinner_after/", "score": 500, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Jeez dude. I'm going to go with YTA even if I think this is why hamsters make kind of bad pets in general.", "YTA.  You might not think a dead hamster is the end of the world.  But your girlfriend really loved the rodent, and needed more time to come to terms with his passing. \n\nThis issue wasn't really about the hamster.  It was about a young lady who was not in the proper mindset to be meeting the boyfriend's family, but you made her go anyway.  \n\nYou can think she was over-reacting, but that does not matter.  She shouldn't have been made to leave home until she felt ready to leave home.", "Yo! Your hamster probably wasn\u2019t dead! Hamsters get buried all the time from going into a hibernation that is very similar to death.", "Not to be morbid, but just in case she decides to get another hamster\u2026are you sure the hamster wasn\u2019t hibernating?\n\nhttps://www.veterinary-practice.com/article/is-my-hamster-hibernating-or-dead", "YTA, I don\u2019t know why you were so concerned with them meeting her because I doubt she will be your gf much longer.", "Replace hamster with cat/dog/horse/some other animal in this story. Does her reaction seem more understandable now? Just because it's just a hamster to you doesn't mean it was the same for her. YTA.", "Everyone grieves differently, regardless of what loss they've experienced and what day of the year it is.\n\nYou were insensitive suggesting to replace her pet to try to minimize her grief.\n\nYou were pushy and self-centered by verbally browbeating her to force her out of bed.\n\nAnd wow were you seriously out of line giving her that craptacular \"no further discussion\" nonsense! \n\nCalling her grief \"performative\" to try to make yourself sound less assholey here really just puts a fine point on exactly how much YTA.\n\nClearly you didn't understand how attached she was to her pet and you did nothing in the moment to actually try to be understanding. You attempted to minimize her grief (and you're still doing so to try to appear less assholey). You showed her you thought she was ridiculous and then actually told her she was. And you were more concerned with potentially being embarrassed than her not feeling up to meeting lots of new people... I really don't see how you could be in any genuine doubt that YTA. No wonder she called you \"emotionally unavailable\".", "YTA. Losing a pet is very similar losing a friend. Imagine if one of your best friends died and she told you to get over two days after. If it'd been over a week and she refused to leave the house over a pet dying you might be in the right, by 2 weeks completely right, but two days? Heck, I randomly cried for a month when my favorite chicken died. You should have at least told your family prior she'd just lost a pet. You seem to completely lack any sympathy here, she's completely right. Anyone who disagrees has clearly never lost a pet.\n\nOn another note, hamsters are the worst pets possible. Every time I hear about one it's about them either dying tragically or being the actual devil. Kinda funny from an outside perspective.", "YTA for your lack of empathy, YTA again for pushing when another adult tells you \"no\".", "Hey also make sure the hamster is dead. They can hibernate if it gets cold enough like the temperature everywhere got. I\u2019d dig it back up today tbh just in case.", "YTA and who TF do you think you are, telling another grown adult \"there will be no further discussion\"? If my boyfriend spoke to me that way, ever, he would be alone very fast.", "YTA. You have no right to dictate how someone mourns.", "YTA her reaction was big, but everyone handles death differently. It wasn't right to try and force her into a large social gathering with new people when she was still in the early stages of grieving.", "You were definitely insensitive to her needs, whether or not you think it was a big deal it's clearly something she's struggling with. My cat is everything to me I feel like it would take me more than two days to feel up to a big social gathering if I were to lose him.\n\nIt reminds me a little of a similar situation. My dad runs a small business and one of his employees had her guinea pig pass away and she took 2 weeks off because she was too sad to work. He called me absolutely dumbfounded for perspective asking whether or not people actually get that attached to guinea pigs haha he gave her the time off because he's a good boss but I do think he needed me to bounce his frustration off so he didn't accidentally tell her he thought it was ridiculous.", "YTA\n\nDo I fully understand that level of sadness over a hamster no - do I have to understand her grief to make it  real also no. She can be as sad as she is.\n\nAnd she set a boundary that you yelled her into changing she didn't wanna go you forced her and belittled her sadness... That is on you.\n\nYour being an A .", "YTA- but don\u2019t worry, with a little luck you\u2019ll have a new girlfriend by next Christmas to bring.", "Holy shit youre the asshole. YTA YTA YTA im not sure why you think you get to dictate anything to another grown ass person.", "YTA and your failing to see the point that even she knew she wouldn't have been good company.  Instead of letting her stay and just explaining to your parents you put her \" reputation \" or worry of it ahead of her own feelings that makes you an AH . Looks like she will be mourning having a  boyfriend soon too !", "YTA. If it was a dog would you have been more understanding? She loved that hamster like one would any other pet and you basically told her she was wrong for grieving.", "YTA.\n\nHer pet meant a lot to her, and her grieving should be a priority. You really need to work on your empathy, otherwise this relationship is doomed (although I think you already ruined it)!\n\nTo many people, pets are *friends and family members*, and she just lost it!\n\nYou forced her into a situation where she had to put her FRESH GRIEF aside and \"function\" for your comfort, selfishness and entitlement.\n\nWhen you can\u2018t even realize that you\u2018re an AH now after posting this, you really don\u2019t deserve her and should do some inner work before entering a relationship ever again.", "YTA for prioritizing social expectations over her feelings. People have the feelings they have. It doesn't do any good to tell them they're unreasonable to have those feelings or to try to rush them to get over their feelings. By telling her your family wouldn't care about her \"excuse\", you further invalidated her feelings.\n\nWhat you could have done was invited her to still come, but to be open with your family about what happened and how she was feeling. Based on how your family reached out to check if she was okay, I'd guess they'd be supportive. If you'd done that, your girlfriend might start to see your family as a support structure, not an obligation who you portrayed as poised to judge her for excessive grief.", "Woooooooooooooow, you seem like you\u2019d be a real hoot in a crisis Mr. Get Over It Police. Just because her hamster wasn\u2019t important to you, doesn\u2019t mean it was not a friend and family member to your GF. \n\nA simple \u201ca beloved pet of my GF\u2019s died suddenly two days ago and she\u2019s not feeling up to a celebration, she extends her deepest apologies and was vey excited to meet everyone\u201d would have sufficed in this situation.\n\nFYI, hamsters live 2-3 years so this was was a premature death. YTA.", "YTA - Grief is not something that can be directed. I once grieved for a kitten I never even had in my possession (I was supposed to go pick him up and a day before he fell from the roof and they had him euthanized without informing me). If you have an emotional bond with something, regardless of whether it's a human who lived to 90+ or a hamster who has the life span of around 2,5 years in captivity, the loss of them can be hard to take.\n\nShe was definitely not in the right mind set to meet your family and they noticed. You could have told your family something happened and that your gf couldn't come. No obligation or reason at all to go into detail on why she couldn't come. Personal emergencies are personal and your family isn't privy to that. \n\nMaybe after a while she'll want a new pet, but trying to replace one so shortly after the loss of the first one IS insensitive to someone who has formed a bond with their pet.", "YTA. You did nothing to 'help'; your primary concern was how things would look and avoiding any 'embarrassment'.", "YTA.\n\nThis may be important to remember: *you don't get to dictate how someone else feels*.\n\nIs it excessive to mourn so hard for a hamster that you can't leave your room for 3 days and miss Christmas?\n\nProbably.\n\nIs it your place to say so?\n\nNo.\n\nShe gets to decide how her pet's death affects her. If that causes you to go off her a bit, that is your right. If you want to make the suggestion to \"go to the dinner anyway, and everyone will understand you're not feeling cheery because your pet died, but they'll appreciate that you came anyway\" then good for you, but do it gently.\n\nBut don't tell her that her feelings are invalid because it's only a hamster. Or try and tell her that watching hamster videos won't help. You have no idea what the critter meant to her and you are not here to rate her grieving process.", "I think it's more ESH\n\n1. Big family events can not always be rescheduled - especially if it's coinciding with a national holiday. \n\n2. A death in the family is a valid reason not to feel up to going to a large family event.\n\n3. It is a perfectly acceptable thing to go to the family event, and tell them that she is grieving but didn't want to miss the chance to meet family. \n\nThere is a way of handling her grief and the family obligations without stressing out or being an AH.", "YTA \nIt's a really tough situation, everyone reacts differently when a pet dies. Some people get really attached and describe it as feeling like they lost one of their closest friends. You weren't supportive or there for her in the way she needed. I dont understand people's grief about their pets either but I try to do the right thing about it even though I have never understood it. If you approached the situation differently it could of changed the outcome but you were a little dismissive of her feelings. I dont believe she should of missed the family event for it. But getting defensive over it definitely isn't what you should do. Apologise to her, and maybe ask her if she wants to talk about the hamster and show you photos or videos of her/him.", "YTA for the way you handled it. Had you shown a bit more tact or sympathy, she may have been more receptive and feel a bit better about the situation, but you weren\u2019t supportive. \n\nYour intentions with the replacement hamster may have been good but it is a very bad move to suggest that someone\u2019s beloved pet is so easily replaceable, even if you think it\u2019s \u201cjust a hamster\u201d. \n\nThe way you told her what to do was pretty rough as well and I\u2019m not surprised she reacted poorly to your actions on Christmas. \n\nWith some communication this situation seems salvageable to me", "YTA but only slightly because of how you handled things on Christmas Day. I agree with you it is is 100% ridiculous to want to skip Christmas dinner because a pet hamster died. BUT Your not her dad- \u201cI told her\u2026she needed to get up right now or she was going to make us late and embarrass us.\u201d \u201cI said she needed to get ready to go and there would be no further discussion.\u201d This is how you talk to a child , not your partner. I know you were really frustrated with her but think a different approach would\u2019ve served you better. Ex- gf I understand that you\u2019re heartbroken, this holiday is really important to me and my family and I really want you by my side, I know it will be hard for you and I\u2019ll support you however I can. Something like that. Not demanding she get up and go.", "I\u2019m not going to vote either way, and she should\u2019ve been allowed to stay home, but\u2026 dang, that\u2019s a lot of reaction from a 22yo. Pet loss grief impacts me for a long time, but you have to deal with it while going to work, continuing to raise children, caring for other pets. You don\u2019t just stop living. He was a jerk, and she became comatose with grief. Neither party is right.", "\"I said she needed to get ready to go no further discussion\"\n\nYTA for this. Look I agree, a hamster is a minor thing but she was upset and your reactions were just making it worse. She probably already had the pressure of meeting the rest of your family while not spending it with your own and if she said she didn't feel comfortable going then she didn't feel comfortable going. Forcing her, \"leaving her alone to cool off\" wasn't going to make things better", "ESH.  You shouldn\u2019t have forced her to go, you should\u2019ve left without her.   As for her, I mean, we\u2019ve all lost pets, but a hamster of one year, days later and she won\u2019t get out of bed on Christmas is a bit much.", "Your girlfriend's hamster dies after 1 year. Life expectancy is 2-3 years. That's like a human dying when they're 30. So that hamster died very unexpectedly. And your girlfriend takes that to heart.

You were ok until you offered to go get a replacement. It doesn\u2019t work that way.\n\nI will say though, as much as I love my pets, it\u2019s not the same level of grief as when I lost a parent. I really worry for people who get so immersed in grief for a pet you know has a 1-2 year life expectancy. I think your gf probably needs to learn some coping behaviours.", "Idk man sounds like she needs therapy to me", "NTA she's 22 not 12 but clearly needs to grow up", "NTA  what is this thing with people, it was a hamster who has a lifespan of up to 3 years maybe a little more.  She is being a drama queen \ud83d\udc51  she needs to grow up and talk about her feelings, nothing wrong with mentioning at dinner my hamster died, get a bit of sympathy and learn to deal with death.  It is really not healthy to be acting like this, mental health is important but we have to look after our own mental health and not put ourselves in situations  which make us feel worse like laying in bed moping.  Apologise for invalidating her feelings but mention you are worried about her and your mum  probably was 2.  Take her out of house, walking/fresh air and talking about future pets will help and of course let her talk about hamster, maybe even get her a framed photo of him/her to hang in home.  Good luck", "NTA and quite frankly she sounds like a really toxic person that believes everything should revolve around her and her emotions.\n\nI get that she's sad, and she had every reason to be upset but you were doing her a very kind favor by inviting her to your family Christmas.", "NTA... If she cannot conduct herself appropriately after a hamster's death how will she react after real issues throughout life. This is telling.", "You\u2019ve done nothing wrong here but I wouldn\u2019t go as far as to say your GF ITA in this story.", "NTA\n\nI get that she was attached to the animal for a year, but for a small as little as a hamster, she shouldn't be this upset. It wasn't a child.\n\nFor this being the first time meeting your extended family, her staying behind would've been worse then showing up in a sad state of mind. She should have out a on poker face, and showed up \"happy & jolly\". \n\nI think you did the right thing regarding offering to buy her a new hamster, they're small pets, easy to manage and replace when their time comes. Transitioing from one to the other shouldn't be an issue, even with something as small as a hamster. \n\nI'd talk to her, recommend that you still think you're right and that she's over reacting. If she still maintains the mindset that you're in the wrong on this, I'd say pack your bags and move on. Little situation like this can be a flag for what's to come over something more serious. \n\nAgain, **NTA**.", "ESH - You shouldn't have forced her to go when she was miserable.

Getting out and around people can be a good thing while you're grieving, to keep you from spiraling.\n\nBut YTA for suggesting someone replace their pet a day after it had died and for thinking that someone being sad their pet had died for 2 days is \"performative\" to the point where you had to leave to cool off. Even if you didn't care about the hamster, she obviously did. She bought it Christmas gifts for goodness' sake. Have some empathy, or else don't date people who get attached to pets if this is how you'll react.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I can't speak to how you handled this situation but ultimately you were trying to remind her to do the adult thing and to continue to be part of not just your life, but the life of your family.  You (and your family) have made a clear investment in both of your futures.  The expectation is that she will be present and able to interact and make a good impression, and show that she is equally invested in that future.  \n\nIt sounds to me like she has poor coping skills and doesn't take her obligations to you or your future together seriously.

Asking your partner and your partner\u2019s family to continue with one of the biggest holidays without you because of the death of your 1 year old hamster is not reasonable.  You don\u2019t have to be cheery or pretend to be completely fine, but you should still be there.  OP NTA", "I'm very lucky to have a partner who would not react the way you did. Everyone deals with the death of a family member differently. Offering to buy a new hamster for the toys she specifically bought for her baby... Is just soulless.

Reschedule your little family dinner, you made everyone feel uncomfortable and really hurt your partner.\n\nNo shit you're an asshole.", "YTA. It\u2019s not unreasonable to be sad about losing a pet for more than 2 days. Just because it\u2019s a hamster doesn\u2019t mean anything less.

God op, you make me sick.\n\nTo you It's just a hamster, to her It's a pet she loved dearly and lost and then her boyfriend decides to be a ass.\n\nIf I was her, this would be a deal breaker, honestly you have no heart.", "ESH\n\nYou can\u2019t force someone to feel better.

She's being way too dramatic and extra about it.", "I don\u2019t think you were a purposeful AH but the way you handled it made you the AH. To you it was just a hamster, to her it was a loved pet. It could also have been about certain memories around the pet that made her sad. Also as others stated, people deal with emotions in different ways. Relationships are about meeting your partner where they are when they need you. I myself would not have understood why someone is so upset about that death of a hamster as the hamsters I had when I was a kid were cute until they ate their young that\u2019s another story for another time. You could have been more supportive even if you didn\u2019t understand. You could watch hamster TikTok\u2019s with her. Cook her some of her favorite foods for breakfast. Offer to watch a movie/massage her feet or w/e. Run her a nice warm bath with some of those calming salts. When the time for the party came, if she wasn\u2019t feeling like coming reassure her that\u2019s okay. Everyone deals with grief differently, your emotions are valid. Pick some little flowers to put on the hamsters grave. Tell your family she just lost a pet and isn\u2019t feeling okay right now. You could also say she\u2019s not feeling well and didn\u2019t want to be a damper on a holiday that\u2019s all about happiness. You did the opposite of all that. You forced someone who was emotionally upset/vulnerable into a high stress/high anxiety situation. I would say talk to your girlfriend, not to Reddit. It\u2019s not too late to be there for her emotionally and explore the communication breakdown that lead to what happened.", "YTA cus of how you handled it. \"No further discussion\" lmao she is not even married to you dude. She can tell you to fuck off and you can't do anything about it.

Can't even bear to open presents because it makes you too sad? Like OP isn't even worth the effort to try and have a nice Christmas?\n\nI also think GF is reading too much into meeting the family.

I get that obviously, the hamster was important to her, but I think the correct way to have gone about this would have been for them to still go, for OP to warn parents ahead of time that gf was feeling upset because of her hamster, and to take a LOT of care to make gf feel loved and included in the festivities.

And it's not like she made an actual effort, she lazed in bed all day (which they gave her space to do) watching cute hamster tiktoks to upset herself further knowing FULL WELL what the plans were. If she was really too upset to go she should have made that clear beforehand. The night before, that morning, etc. Honestly gf sounds emotionally immature and wanted OP to miss holidays with extended family they likely rarely get to see to be coddled for...how long exactly?

Because there's an animal involved it just doesn't matter?\n\nIf I had to explain to my family that her pet died they'd likely be understanding...until I told them what it was. It's a hamster. OP should have not forced her to go, but honestly she doesn't sound mature enough to be in a relationship.

Like an apology would cover it, it's not the grave offense you're all making it out to be.\n\nGrief for pets is hard, I get that, but like honestly people on Reddit have more empathy for a goldfish than an actual human being in any given situation. Everyone blasting OP over this is enabling really shitty self-centered behavior on the GF's behalf. If she was just feeling down and said she wasn't up to going that would be one thing, but she was dramatically laying in bed watching hamster videos to upset herself on purpose. That was an active choice to do on that day, not day one, two or three, THAT day.

I made up a hot water bottle (wrapped up in towels so it wouldn\u2019t burn) and gently placed him on it to keep him warm and comfortable during his final moments. He could barely move but somehow he mustered up the energy to crawl slowly towards me, so I scooped him up, where he laid cozily before he died in my arms. He didn\u2019t want to die on a warm, comfy water bottle. He just wanted to be loved. That was 6 years ago and I still tear up sometimes when I think about him. Hamsters are not the disposable, detached pets you think they are and their deaths can be seriously upsetting, especially if a particularly strong bond was formed, as it sounds is the case here. \n\nFYI a year is still considered a pretty short life even for a hamster, and not all hamsters show signs of illness before they die, so it\u2019s entirely reasonable that the death was unexpected therefore even more upsetting for your gf.

I'm hoping the gf knew this before and verified it was dead and not hibernating.", "Agree completely (and I\u2019ve had many pets including hamsters in my lifetime!) And I wonder if it wasn\u2019t also about being separated from her own family at Christmas *and* OP not being at all sensitive to her needs. I doubt this relationship will last if this is the case *especially after the \u201cno further discussion,\u201d bit.", "I'd bet she retreated to the bed to get away from HIM and his callous _nagging_ about being 'embarrassed'.

How does she have mental health issues for grieving a pet for 2 days and not wanting to go to Christmas? She\u2019s had this pet longer than she\u2019s even known OP, and his first advice is just to go buy another one???\n\nYou and OP are honestly heartless.

Humans pack bond with anything.", "I work at a funeral home where I\u2019m expected to not show emotion when a mother is telling me about how her 4 year old son died. But when my rat died I balled for a day straight, some people are just more emotional. She\u2019s entitled to her feelings.", "Thank you!

She\u2019s entitled to her feelings.", "Especially since it mentions early on that she has no family nearby. That little hamster has probably been her whole world and only comfort for most of its life.", "You didn't consider her needs at all. All you care about is yourself. You're so selfish. She just needed time to herself; you could have told your family that she wasn't feeling up to it. Instead you forced her out of bed so that YOU wouldn't be embarrassed. You're such a bad partner. You're not a partner at all. You don't care about making her feel better. You just don't want her to ruin YOUR day. Shame on you!", ">I think my needs\n\nThis is not needs, this wants", "If you don\u2019t see how laying in bed would make her feel better then you clearly don\u2019t understand a lot of basic grief.\n\nI know it\u2019s different, but I lost my grandmother 3 or so weeks ago and I spent like nearly a full week in bed. No it didn\u2019t *heal* my pain but it meant I had a comfortable place to *feel* my pain. When we\u2019re sad or scared or in pain and emotional distress, we seek out the most comforting place we can. She should be allowed to grieve her lost pet in a way that gives her the safest and most comforting recovery possible.\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t something that affects your \u2018needs\u2019, this is a \u2018wants\u2019.

But that doesn\u2019t mean you have the right to shut her down (re: \u201cno further discussion\u201d, such a shitty thing to say.) and belittle her feelings. You\u2019re being incredibly insensitive. Not an attractive trait. \n\n\nYTA", "Doesn't it depend on the kind of hamster?

A hamster can be loved and well cared for but have an unknown medical problem that cuts it\u2019s life short. Or who knows how long that hamster was alive before she adopted it.

Genuinely curious sorry if I read as a dick", "Cats do that too, in fact many animals do including Rats, Lions, Bears, Prairie Dogs (up to a third in some places!).

Except I wound up with like 20 donated fish tanks and more hamsters then any human should have . It was too much so my dad brought in our 3 cats and I let like 200+ hamsters go free by pushing over their tanks. It was like a flood of adorableness.

If you move somewhere new, away from family and friends, feeling a little lonely, then a pet is such a big deal!

OP said that she wasn't able to go home to see her family - that could have been adding to her grief.\n\nOP, YTA for the bots.

Jesus Christ the death of a beloved pet is *infinitely* more important than a stupid family gathering on a holiday that happens every fucking year.", "No I wouldn't because it's not the same thing. A dog or cat is a pet you typically have for over a decade. You form a genuine bond and a symbiosis. You become part of each other's lives like family. That hamster thinks you're going to eat it every time you pick it up, it doesn't care if you live or die. Plus they're incredibly fragile, they just die all the time. In this case though these two jack wagons probably buried a live hamster that was hibernating. Look, for the record I think OP was an AH. He was incredibly insensitive and should have just let her stay home. I'm genuinely sorry her pet died. Just because it was a hamster doesn't mean it's life didn't have value and she shouldn't grieve, but if we're going to act like her behavior isn't out of proportion to the level of loss then we're doomed as a species.

Did you told them after so they could understand why she wasn't on her best mood? or again omitted that info and cared only about appearances?", "And just like you have a tangible, emotional bond with your pet, so did this woman. Hamsters are surprisingly smart, they can learn tricks, their names, and form bonds with their people. The fact that you were over the death of a pet of any sort that fast is... a little sad to me. It implies to me that you didn't care about the animal - did you spend much time with it? If not, you probably didn't bond very well with it. If you did you would have noticed that it had a full bright personality. To an animal, we're essentially their world.
