Haylee (25f), Amy (25f), and Danni (24f). \n\n\nEveryone was there minus Danni as she was putting her kids to sleep.

I know i would really enjoy OPs plan on my wedding day and i wouldnt connect it to negativity so maybe OP is the same\n\nSo YWNBTA for me. If OP wants to do it she should go for it, if not, not", "So.. why are you still friends with Tammy and Amy? You seem to not like them. What\u2019s the point of continuing a relationship with them? It makes you seem like the drama chaser. Emotionally mature people understand how to walk away from those who are so negative and childish", "[removed]", "The wedding isn\u2019t just about what OP wants. The wedding is about her *and* her fianc\u00e9. \n\nShe has already stated that her fianc\u00e9 is among those who want her to uninvite Tammy.\n\nIt\u2019s his wedding too, remember.", "Then I feel like the place for her is in a psychiatric hospital, not your wedding", "The timeline isn't completely clear, but I think that at the time of OP sending the link to the dress in the group chat, she didn't know about Tammy's nonsense. She just thought it was her friend showing interest in her wedding, like a normal person.", "Partial comment stolen from: /u/Auroraburst \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10fz71h/wibta_if_i_let_my_friend_make_a_fool_of_herself/j4zpmuc/\n\nBot Reported.", "Oh right, of course!"]}
