They learned valuable lessons, that crying doesn't always get what you want, and that growling dogs mean business and should be left alone. NTA", "NTA. It's your job as a pet owner to both protect that animal, and to make sure that animal is not a danger to others. Your sister is the one out of line for presuming it is her right to demand her children be able to interact with *your* dog. The kids will get over not being able to pet her, but it would be an absolute shit-show for everyone were Zoey to bite one of them.", "NTA \n\nThank you for taking responsibility for your dogs actions and being an aware dog parent. Your niblings wouldn't have had a reason to be upset if they had listened to you when you stopped them earlier. Let this be a lesson in consent for them.

Thanks for being a responsible and caring dog owner, you know your dog can react negatively to small kids, so you were keeping her from the impact of her behavior should it result in a bite, and you were protecting your nibbling from a possible negative interaction with your dog that could have ended Ina bite", "NTA what the hell kind of parent would want their child to pet a growling dog? Your sister is so out of line.", "NTA- Doggy safety is a huge priority and kiddos are old enough o be able to understand that.", "NTA, you were protecting her kids. \n\nalso, LOL at Niblings", "NTA - you were trying to keep the kids safe. She is your dog, so at the end of the day, if, you don't want someone touching her, that's your prerogative. Also, it's safer for the dog too, you don't want her to have what could be a traumatic event for her (which she signalled with growling) and further ruin any contact with young kids she might have. You did the right thing, as upsetting it is for the kids not to play with the dog. Your sister is out of line for telling you what you should do with your dog, especially since you know her temperament better than anyone", "NTA. You were doing what you had to in order to protect the kids. And it sounds like you were nice about it and explained why. So yeah, definitely NTA", "What\u2019s a nibling\u2026? NTA for keep your nieces and nephews away from your dog.", "NTA for not letting them touch a dog who is giving you signs of distress.  I\u2019m a bit concerned you take a dog who dislikes kids this much into public.  A dog that growls at kids needs more training and shouldn\u2019t be around them without it.  You aren\u2019t TA for not letting them touch the dog, but if kids are a trigger and the dog is going to react this strongly they can\u2019t come over safely.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have no doubt that the mom would have been out for blood if that dog had bit or nipped those kids, so what you were doing was keeping both the kids and your dog safe. Mom should be teaching her kids to first ask to pet, because anything less than that is putting them in harms way.", "NTA - your 2 older niblings are well old enough to learn that no means no.  And your sister is not only an AH, she's freaking idiot who probably shouldn't have kids because she's stupid enough to try to force interaction between her own children and a growling dog.  Has she always been this clueless?  Sheesh!  Thank you so much for taking care of innocent on both sides of this equation.", "NTA. My pup was the same way. She'd growl at my younger nephews but she loved the eldest. As they grew up she started being friendlier as they aged. She sadly passed last year, right when she was warming up to the youngest. He was very sad about that.\n\nYou know what my brother never did? Scolded me for not letting the little ones pet the distressed dog. He'd help me gently tell them that she was nervous around them but when they were older she'd warm right up. \n\nI guarantee your sister would have been a lot more pissed if any of her kids had gotten bitten. She needs a reality check", "You did the responsible thing for the kids, your dog, and YOU.  Your sister needs to say thank you and move on.   You are protecting everyone.  I applaud you.", "NTA.
