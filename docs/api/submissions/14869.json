{"id": 14869, "submission_id": "12ne09g", "title": "Update: Refusing to Cook", "selftext": "I spoke with each family member individually about their behavior. 10F apologized profusely and said that \"sometimes \\[she\\] doesn't like my cooking\". 17F (who has only been with us since she was 16 and didn't grow up with us. It was a bit too long and off-topic for the original post) said she appreciated that I make varied recipes, even if she didn't always like them. She also said that she WANTED to cook, but had seen Husband and 10F's reactions to mine and was put off it. Husband accepted the TA judgement from the sub and to his credit, he planned and executed every evening meal.\n\nThe kids ate his meals, but husband's lack of finesse (overboiled vegetables, untrimmed meat, soggy pasta, etc) caused some picked-over meals from the kids. Everything was edible, though, and he very politely asked for some tips on things (like how long to cook rice) but I did not physically help. I reassured him that I wasn't trying to watch him fail but that I needed him to learn a lesson.\n\nAfter a couple of weeks, both kids were tired of husband's oft-repeated recipes (homemade pizza, Korean beef/veg bowls, and nuggets/fries) and he was stressed trying to get home from work in time to get meals done. The very first night, 10F cried over her \"dry, gross\" pizza crust. Husband fought her over it and BOTH OF THEM looked to me to solve the issue. I redirected 10F to Husband, saying it's his call since it's his dinner. With several meals, he made WAY too much mediocre food and had to eat leftovers for DAYS, which was cathartic.\n\nEventually, I sat down with Husband and we evaluated the fallout. Husband said it hurt when the girls didn't like his food, and it was hard to plan things ahead on night he worked late. He also admitted he was in a rut for recipes and that it was hard to modify for people's preferences.\n\nThere is now a posted schedule and rule set that ALL family members are expected to adhere to. Each kid picked a night to cook (10F has Sunday, 17F has Saturday). Husband and I split the weekdays according to work schedule. Since he works late on Monday and Friday, I took those. I work Tuesday and Thursday nights, so those belong to him. Wednesday is a flex day. Anyone can cook, or we might go out, and group projects are encouraged. The rules are:\n\nNO gagging, \"faces\", or complaining\n\nCook chooses the meal, period\n\nAssistance may be requested by anyone\n\nSpecial ingredient requests must be made a minimum of two days in advance\n\nSo far so good. 17F has been learning a lot of technique, 10F is thrilled to be addressed as \"Chef\" by whoever is assisting her, and no one has yet broken any of the Rules. Husband more easily asks for my advice when he's cooking (how to season, how long to cook things) which is a huge improvement. It's too early to declare victory, and it takes a long time to make permanent changes, but it's encouraging progress.\n\nThanks everyone for the advice and the support!

I was so stressed out by it, because my sibling doesn't tolerate family members correcting the kids' behaviour, and when sibling told me I'm shit with the kids I went upstairs and cried. \n\nI spent a fortune trying to buy food they'd eat, I cooked two sets of every meal so they'd have food they could eat, made multiple supermarket runs and watching a 12 year old sulk because their oblivious aunt had bought nice sourdough bread instead of a french baguette, and they didn't like it, was truly a stab to the heart as ridiculous as it sounds. I'd made so much effort cooking and bringing in food to make nice meals. The 10 year old flipped their shit because I served fresh peas and they only eat frozen. \n\nMy sibling doesn't know it, but they and the family aren't welcome in my home until behaviours change. There will not be an invite, probably for several years. \n\nI absolutely feel for you, and I seriously don't know how it hasn't destroyed your marriage because if my partner had done that and encouraged the kids the same way, I wouldn't have been able to be as gracious as you.
