{"id": 14869, "submission_id": "12ne09g", "title": "Update: Refusing to Cook", "selftext": "I spoke with each family member individually about their behavior. 10F apologized profusely and said that \"sometimes \\[she\\] doesn't like my cooking\". 17F (who has only been with us since she was 16 and didn't grow up with us. It was a bit too long and off-topic for the original post) said she appreciated that I make varied recipes, even if she didn't always like them. She also said that she WANTED to cook, but had seen Husband and 10F's reactions to mine and was put off it. Husband accepted the TA judgement from the sub and to his credit, he planned and executed every evening meal.\n\nThe kids ate his meals, but husband's lack of finesse (overboiled vegetables, untrimmed meat, soggy pasta, etc) caused some picked-over meals from the kids. Everything was edible, though, and he very politely asked for some tips on things (like how long to cook rice) but I did not physically help. I reassured him that I wasn't trying to watch him fail but that I needed him to learn a lesson.\n\nAfter a couple of weeks, both kids were tired of husband's oft-repeated recipes (homemade pizza, Korean beef/veg bowls, and nuggets/fries) and he was stressed trying to get home from work in time to get meals done. The very first night, 10F cried over her \"dry, gross\" pizza crust. Husband fought her over it and BOTH OF THEM looked to me to solve the issue. I redirected 10F to Husband, saying it's his call since it's his dinner. With several meals, he made WAY too much mediocre food and had to eat leftovers for DAYS, which was cathartic.\n\nEventually, I sat down with Husband and we evaluated the fallout. Husband said it hurt when the girls didn't like his food, and it was hard to plan things ahead on night he worked late. He also admitted he was in a rut for recipes and that it was hard to modify for people's preferences.\n\nThere is now a posted schedule and rule set that ALL family members are expected to adhere to. Each kid picked a night to cook (10F has Sunday, 17F has Saturday). Husband and I split the weekdays according to work schedule. Since he works late on Monday and Friday, I took those. I work Tuesday and Thursday nights, so those belong to him. Wednesday is a flex day. Anyone can cook, or we might go out, and group projects are encouraged. The rules are:\n\nNO gagging, \"faces\", or complaining\n\nCook chooses the meal, period\n\nAssistance may be requested by anyone\n\nSpecial ingredient requests must be made a minimum of two days in advance\n\nSo far so good. 17F has been learning a lot of technique, 10F is thrilled to be addressed as \"Chef\" by whoever is assisting her, and no one has yet broken any of the Rules. Husband more easily asks for my advice when he's cooking (how to season, how long to cook things) which is a huge improvement. It's too early to declare victory, and it takes a long time to make permanent changes, but it's encouraging progress.\n\nThanks everyone for the advice and the support!

Although the \"taking a taste\" part may be something you want to do every time even if the food wasn't liked before: palates grow with the rest of the child and what was yucky before might become a favorite after several tries. Looking at you, mushrooms!).\n\nParticipation in the menu choosing/food prep is a great way to get children to be more adventurous eaters.

I'm lucky that my parents were very good about catering to me, and I also learned to start making things myself from a pretty early age so I could always make myself something I knew I liked if I needed to.\n\nMy mom had a lot of issues around eating due to being forced to choke down any meal she hated while growing up whereas my dad is much more open to trying new foods and such because his family had a rule that if you didn't like what was made for dinner after trying it you could go make yourself a sandwich. So they made a decision to allow me to try things and not have to eat it all if I didn't like it.\n\nMy dad figured out it helped to learn what exactly I hated about certain foods though, cause then he could work around it. That also helped me eventually be able to tailor recipes to my own restrictions. Like how he would make soup and leave the onion whole and the celery cut into thirds. It would give the soup flavor, which I was fine with, but he could scoop them back out and cut them up to add to his own bowl while I wouldn't have to deal with the texture in mine.\n\nI even started taking that to more extremes for some things. One example is salsa, as silly as it is. I love the flavor of it, but cannot stand the texture of the chunks in it. So now I dump the jar of it into my food processor, give said jar a little rinse, puree the salsa until there's no chunks, and dump it back in the jar.

So after he'd finished shouting at me, I'd wait an hour or so til he wasn't watching and then I'd go to the cupboard and fill up on chips and biscuits because I was still hungry.\n\nWasn't til I was in my late teens that I managed to break out of the 'vegetables =bad' mindset, but yeah...

Quite possibly the best possible outcome that could have come out of this.\n\nWhat I would like to know is this: ever since yall have switched to your current schedule rotation, has your 10YO had a change in attitude at all, or is she still a picky eater? I was really picky at that age myself, and I feel like if I was made more involved in the cooking, that it would not have been as prevalent as it was.\n\nIn any case, congratulations on the very positive change in your household. I'm rooting for you!", "Great outcome. When my son was at home and soup was on the menu for supper all of us had a hand in fixing it. I usually cooked the meat at the time. Hubby would cut and or add the veggies. We would all end up finishing the the spices. I usually started them and my son would be the last one putting his touch on it. After he left home our soup isn't the same. \nNow my 10 yr old granddaughter does it when we make chili. Hubby cooks the meat and I chop and open the cans. My granddaughter puts the chopped and open cans in the pot and she does the majority of the spices. We still test it to see what is missing until the lid goes on. When hubby and I make it without her it doesn't taste the same. \n\nAn idea you might think about is all of you sit down and menu plan. Dig out the cookbooks and have them look at websites. Include some freezer meals in your rotation. If you have a slow cooker or Insta-pot you can put the majority of the ingredients in a freezer bag. If you have a busy night coming up take your freezer meal out a day or two before and put it in the refrigerator to thaw. Throw it in the slow cooker in the morning before the cook of the day leaves the house. \n\nNot real positive on putting some websites on here. If you need a site or YouTube channel send me a message and I'll send you the links. Everyone can help throw together the freezer meals once or twice a month. It really will help when you plan ahead. \n\nOne more thing. Get some freezer to microwave containers. If there is a meal that you have leftovers for one or two, but not enough for the whole family. Put them in the container label and freeze. You have it for a lunch, or a meal that just does not appeal to someone. For example, you made mashed potatoes, chicken nuggets and gravy with a vegetable. You have a little bit of everything enough for one meal. Make a KFC bowl with a bit of shredded cheese on top. Instant lunch or meal for someone later on.", "Not only did you teach everyone a valuable lesson in respect and appreciation for the effort in cooking, you\u2019ve also taught a very valuable lesson in being a family.

Like the 17 years old \u201cday\u201d is Saturday I\u2019m sure there will be days she would rather be out with friends then cook for family. And rely every weekend on the kids to cook in theory might be good to teach them, but after some time it\u2019s making it a chore instead of challenge. \nI\u2019m speaking from experience. I was expected to cook during weekdays (every other day, as we had leftovers) and right now\u2026 I honestly hate cooking if it\u2019s a chore. I can cook if I feel like it and feels inspired but cooking everyday? Big no. \nIt\u2019s good it works for you now. But ultimately it\u2019s on you and your husband to provide food, not on the kids.

She noted, also, that in a professional role social events might occur where refusing a dish could have an adverse effect on my career or that of my husband. I have more than once been grateful for that training and her explanation.", "[removed]", "That's good advice. Taste and texture are such huge things when it comes to food and not everyone realizes it. I refuse to order veggies from a couple of restaurants (one chain and one local to my parents' home in Michigan) that oversalt the veggies. Don't know what it is that makes them do it either. If it was an ethnicity thing, that'd be one thing, but the chain is one of those typical American restaurant chains while the other is Italian. I've been to other chain restaurants that do veggies right, so I'm assuming the other restaurants never learned to make the veggies correctly. With the Italian, I'm betting they've got pots of boiling salted water ready for whenever someone orders pasta (a good chunk of their orders), so it probably doesn't occur to them to not cook the veggies in anything else, or so I miss my guess.", "The downside is some kids (and adults) are autistic or have sensory issues in general; sensory issues can cause all sorts of issues when it comes to food. I can't eat most seafood because of that and my mom, when we're out and wants calamari, has to order it in very specific dishes so the smell of the calamari doesn't overwhelm me. Most of it, with seafood, is a smell issue. With shrimp, it's more texture and I have to eat it in very specific ways and yes, I have tried it in almost every way imaginable, that's how I know. I have a similar texture issue with most mac and cheese, though some of it's taste, too.\n\nWhile having autistic kids try a bite might work, it honestly depends on the autistic kid. I'm mostly fine with trying new foods, but some, I'll reject because I know I won't like an ingredient and can't always ask for it to be made without-prepackaged meals, for example. Making it at home, I can adjust as needed, but I don't always feel comfortable asking at restaurants. Other autistic people, even as adults, have problems because their sensory issues are worse than mine are. Not every autistic person can make those adjustments either, which makes it hard for them.", "That's what my mom did with me growing up and now I can cook almost any recipe. Some recipes, though, just need 2 people and that's just because if one of us is making it for ourselves, we have to do stuff in very specific ways to have everything ready on time. For me, if I'm making any sort of beef stew, especially if I'm doing it in a slow cooker, I cut everything up *first,* doing the onion last even though it's the second ingredient that needs to be cooked up before getting dumped into the slow cooker. Why I do it that way...well, it's more because I'll sometimes grab bites of whatever I'm cutting up and onion juices just make them taste weird.", "Yes. We had a family dinner most nights, and my mom was not at all a great cook. But she got home from work and prepared a proper family dinner every weekday. We were expected to help: Set the table, all the cleanup, etc. She made about 10 meals, and we liked most of it well enough. when we didn\u2019t tho\u2026\n\nI\u2019m trying to picture my father\u2019s face if one of us had been disrespectful to my mother about the food.

Actually, I believe they taught us that language: \u201cI don\u2019t care for x.\u201d you might have replied if someone asked. Nobody ever left the table to make something different. You just filled up on the other dishes. \n\nWe were regular, smart mouth, middle class, kids. But the dinner table was an important space for my parents. You had to show up hands scrubbed, tv off, and with a decent attitude. My folks were big on manners, and before you left the table we were taught to say \u201cthank you for dinner mom.

I've got this turkey chili recipe I **love** that I rarely make, mostly because to get the ground turkey, my mom has to go to Sam's Club. It also takes close to 5 hours to do, once all the prep is done, but it's well worth it in the end.

We got what was served and mostly had to finish our plate. If we were stuffed that was one thing or if there was something we really, really didn't like it wasn't pushed. If we didn't finish dinner though and got hungry later, well here you go. No dessert if dinner wasn't finished and definitely no snacks. We also had to ask to be excused if we were done before everyone else. Dinner time was family time.\n\nIt's just me and my boyfriend now and we eat on the couch, but the TV stays off.

No ketchup or tartar sauce allowed.  \n\nMy epic vomiting at the table that night became a thing of family legend. \n\nThe next time my mother made fish, there was a little quiche sitting on my plate.", "My mom was the same way.  Luckily, I would eat pretty much anything and I even liked things like brussels sprouts, lima beans, liverwurst, etc.\n\nThe one exception was sauerkraut and kielbasa.  Even the smell of sauerkraut makes me gag, so on those nights I would just stay in my room and read because I wasn\u2019t allowed to eat anything else.  Mom eventually relented after the 4th or 5th time she cooked it, and began bringing a couple of hot dogs for me to eat in my room.", "My aunt had the no leaving the table u til it's finished rule and one night, my cousin actually fell asleep at the table because she refused to eat.\n\nMy mum had the \"eat your plate or have a sandwich/toast\" rule so that I still got food and didn't starve but also learnt that picky eaters don't get major catering too. My aunt would routinely make 3 types of vegetables for her family of 4 as well as some nights, which were 2 types of chicken or 2 types of pasta dishes. \n\nI have 2 picky eaters but both my boys have learnt that if they don't eat what's on their plate all they can have is some fruit or a sandwich and after awhile they realised that they were still hungry so I told them all they had to eat was their dinner. Now they have started eating their dinner without arguing and are even trying new things (7M still has vegetable issues but is getting there) because apparently the sandwiches and fruit were boring.", "Yeah. The 80\u2019s. My parents didn\u2019t trip about whether we ate or not. Our school lunch was 11 AM. We didn\u2019t have a lot of chances to buy or procure junk food or whatever throughout the day. We all played a lot of sports afterschool and so we were starving by 730. We ate. And then if someone didn\u2019t feel like it, it wasn\u2019t a problem. They did want us to take one bite, to try any new to us food on our plate. But it wasn\u2019t something they were going to throw down about.\n\nThey were all about manners, and I could even call it decorum. My brother once turned up for dinner in a white T-shirt. And to my dad, that was an undershirt, some thing you had on under your clothes like underwear. And he asked him to go put a shirt on. No books were open at the table. It was conversation. Sometimes it was torture. Sometimes it felt forced. Sometimes it was very natural. And it could be a lot of fun. It was an hour we spent together as a family almost every night.
