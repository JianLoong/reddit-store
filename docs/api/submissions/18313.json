My mom didn\u2019t tell me all the details about the trip and the reason we are going is for an event happening on June 24th. Anyway she tells me she is going to book tickets she doesn\u2019t tell me what dates and she didn\u2019t even know what days she was going to book the tickets. I have something to do June 17th-18th, I really didn\u2019t think that trip would interfere. But then yesterday after school she tells me she booked the trip June 17 - June 25. I tell her that I had something planned June 17-18 (she was there when I made plans but they were really weren\u2019t important to her). She tries to tell me that I\u2019ll have to compromise but I was really forward to what I had that weekend and at the same I feel frustrated that she didn\u2019t check with me the dates before booking and expressed that to her. She claimed that she had to do it because tickets were expensive. I asked her if maybe she could change the leaving date to June 19 (she still had 24 hours to change the reservation). She started getting frustrated that I was giving the weekend event more importance than the trip which was making me get frustrated. She started saying how she felt disrespected by me and started crying. I started crying too because I didn\u2019t feel respected by her for plans that I had made and I kind of had set in stone and even confirmed with people. She said that I should learn to compromise but how should I if this all could\u2019ve been avoided if she just would\u2019ve told me the dates before she booked them. In  the end I told her to reschedule my ticket or cancel my tickets completely. She decided to do cancel and reschedule both of our tickets but then she got mad because they didn\u2019t fully refund the luggage and tickets were expensive. My dad said that he wasn\u2019t taking sides but I felt like he was taking my mom\u2019s side and blaming me for all of this.

I'm sorry that the compromise couldn't be reached even though I had seen you show restraint. When the dust settles explaining to her that as an young adult sometimes your decisions won't always align with hers (your event is more important than she realized) but you appreciated the gesture/thought regardless of the outcome, is probably the closest you should get to apologizing. You shouldn't apologize for knowing what your priorities are."]}
