My mom didn\u2019t tell me all the details about the trip and the reason we are going is for an event happening on June 24th.

I have something to do June 17th-18th, I really didn\u2019t think that trip would interfere. But then yesterday after school she tells me she booked the trip June 17 - June 25. I tell her that I had something planned June 17-18 (she was there when I made plans but they were really weren\u2019t important to her). She tries to tell me that I\u2019ll have to compromise but I was really forward to what I had that weekend and at the same I feel frustrated that she didn\u2019t check with me the dates before booking and expressed that to her. She claimed that she had to do it because tickets were expensive. I asked her if maybe she could change the leaving date to June 19 (she still had 24 hours to change the reservation). She started getting frustrated that I was giving the weekend event more importance than the trip which was making me get frustrated. She started saying how she felt disrespected by me and started crying. I started crying too because I didn\u2019t feel respected by her for plans that I had made and I kind of had set in stone and even confirmed with people. She said that I should learn to compromise but how should I if this all could\u2019ve been avoided if she just would\u2019ve told me the dates before she booked them. In  the end I told her to reschedule my ticket or cancel my tickets completely. She decided to do cancel and reschedule both of our tickets but then she got mad because they didn\u2019t fully refund the luggage and tickets were expensive. My dad said that he wasn\u2019t taking sides but I felt like he was taking my mom\u2019s side and blaming me for all of this.

It's a thing adults do.", "NTA.

I'm sorry that the compromise couldn't be reached even though I had seen you show restraint. When the dust settles explaining to her that as an young adult sometimes your decisions won't always align with hers (your event is more important than she realized) but you appreciated the gesture/thought regardless of the outcome, is probably the closest you should get to apologizing. You shouldn't apologize for knowing what your priorities are.", "Info: what was the difference in ticket price and what were your plans? I feel this is relevant info.", "NTA it's ridiculous that your mother started crying over this. I know people aren't going to like this but IMO parents don't get to cry over disagreements like this with their kids. They need to set examples of healthier behavior and crying because you can't come to an agreement with someone over something like the dates of a vacation is childish. Unless you were hurling verbal abuse at her that's not a good example she's setting.", "INFO what are your plans and what do you mean your mom was there when you made the plans? And why are you going to Texas? Is it a vacation? Is it to visit someone? \n\n\nYTA for now for being vague about your plans and not answering when asked about the details. I feel like your story has holes.", "INFO: What is the reason for going to Texas and what are your plans?", "YTA. You say you compromised, but you didn\u2019t. Your mom cancelled tickets and lost money. The fact that you left out major details like what plans you had and what event is in Texas says a lot. You made your mom cry because you acted like an entitled brat. For the people that say it doesn\u2019t matter, that\u2019s bullshit. If the 17 year old is just hanging with friends, but there\u2019s a wedding in Texas that matters. Also, as a 17 year old in America living with their parents, you are still a minor. You don\u2019t get the autonomy of dictating where and when you\u2019ll go somewhere.", "NTA. You have to learn to compromise because she never did? Good work OP for standing your ground.", "Info:\n\n\nWhat is your event?\n\n\nWhy are you going to Texas?\n\n\nYou can't claim your Mum is wrong without context!", "If you're the only one making a sacrifice, you're not compromising. Compromising requires both sides to meet in the middle.", "ESH. Your mom sounds chaotic and who plans trips that way? I know you said your mom was there when you made the plans, but if this is what your mom is like then it was on you to very clearly communicate to her. \u201cMom, I now have plans this weekend and will not be going if you book the trip conflicting with those dates.\u201d Yes, your mom should pay attention and you are a child, it doesn\u2019t seem like this should be your responsibility. However, you knew she was booking an undefined trip, you you knew she was winging the booking, and you knew these plans were happening within one week of that trip, you should have gone the extra mile.", "NTA, mom should be compromising in this situation. Not you.", "Compromise goes both ways. She just thinks her plans are more important because she's the mom. She should have asked you about dates before booking. That's common courtesy.", "What\u2019s the event", "Sorry.  I cant make this trip at this time. Next time we'll try to coordinate better", "ESH. You and your mother did not sufficiently communicate with each other. Even in the days before shared electronic calendars, my parents and I had a paper calendar we shared to avoid situations like this. All this stress sounds avoidable.", "That info is not relevant.", "How does that matter?\n\nI mean, her mother booked tickets without talking to her daughter about the availability on that date and just assumed her daughter would drop everything here and there just for her.\n\nShe should have asked her daughter before booking something. \n\nOr do you expect the daughter to put her life on hold and never ever plan something for herself that doesn't include the family, so that she is always available?", "You keep saying that she says you need to compromise. What is the compromise and what is she giving up? A compromise doesn\u2019t just come from one side.", "INFO: what does \u201cshe was there\u201d mean? She was there while you were on the phone making the plans, she was nearby doing something else, she was actively involved in the conversation?\n\nI\u2019m leaning toward ESH cause even when my mom is near me, she\u2019s not 100% invested in every thing I\u2019m doing. Partly out of a sense of giving me space and privacy and partly because she\u2019s a human living her own life. I don\u2019t expect my mom to remember everything that\u2019s important to me, unless I communicate to her how important it is. She has a million other things going on. Why didn\u2019t you make sure your mom knew for a fact those were no-go dates?\n\nIf you did that and THEN she was trying to force you to compromise, then it would be N T A. However, it seems you both had poor communication and execution for planning this trip, so for now it\u2019s ESH.", "It is crucially relevant!\n\nShe is 17. What kind of major non-postponable plans can she have, without her mother knowing about it? \nIf her plan was on going out with some friends, yes, she is absolutely unreasonable. If her plans were a more or less mandatory eg. school event or something objectively important, well the mother is just very bad at planning.", "In my universe, it\u2019s all relevant and interrelated.  Plans to hit the mall with friends is exponentially different that plans to travel out of town for a one night only concert.  Mom saving $80 by booking so early is likewise incredibly different that mom saving $600, especially if money is tight.  Context can change my vote either way.", "Several reasons. I wonder if these plans were something that could have easily been moved and that was part of the \u201ccompromise\u201d since mom said she bay word but this post doesn\u2019t include one.  Also, this is a minor, her mom can make plans for her, sorry.  The lack of detail makes it too sketchy for a judgement to me.", "I see this all the time. When someone says, \u201cyou need to compromise\u201d, what they really mean is \u201cyou need to come over to my side\u201d. If they were willing to move any on their side, they would say \u201cwe need to find a compromise\u201d, which of course, they never say.", "My spouse and I have a running joke: \u201cSure, we\u2019ll compromise. We\u2019ll do it my way.\u201d", "But when you plan travelling with someone else, in this case with your daughter, you make sure that the other person agrees to the date and not just planning something without telling them beforehand so they can say that this is a good or bad date for the journey and even book the tickets without confirming it with the other person!!! And then have the audacity to be upset and even crying is beyond me!!\n\nOP is NTA here."]}
