You don't give any mention of the trips importance or your plans. That does factor in. And sometimes when you are checking/booking flights, you have to decide at that moment or its going to cost more later or be sold out. To me, it sounds like she told you as soon as she booked it.

She's asking you to compromise but you're really looking forward to your plan.... is it a plan that can be moved more easily than an entire flight/weeklong trip?

If it was something important (prom, graduation, unable to call off work, etc) I'd agree with you but anything else I have to say you're kind of at the whim of the person who purchased the tickets for you, which were probably fairly expensive. It's alright for your mom to be upset that she purchased the tickets and then had to waste money because of your plans, it was kind of her to spend extra to change the tickets in the first place. You'll probably feel differently when you're a little older and start booking your own tickets and realize that little changes can raise the cost a ridiculous amount.

There are big price differences in tickets depending on when you fight out sometimes.

Many concerned are asking for more info and this deliberate omission of info likely compromises OPs situation. \n\nYes the plans are relevant. Context is relevant. Making your parent spend more money on something they shouldn't have to for a event that can be rescheduled makes OP the TA\n\nBut if OP has solid plans that really can't budge then they are not TA, like a concert, birthday party, something that is date dependant etc\n\nI get autonomy and exercising it, but unless OP opted to not come for any family vacation they shouldn't be dictating the dates around a possibly a plan that could be rescheduled and making others shell out more money than needed.", "Paragraphs man", "NTA.

Having a girls weekend at your friend\u2019s house: reschedulable\n\nOP knew they had this coming up and should\u2019ve clearly communicated with mom that they wouldn\u2019t be available. It\u2019s on OP *and* her mom *both* to make sure her mom had all the info prior to making plans. So if it\u2019s not something OP can reschedule, E S H. Mom and OP both should\u2019ve communicated better, and mom shouldn\u2019t expect OP to be the only one to \u201ccompromise.\u201d If OP\u2019s event can be rescheduled then OP is T A for making mom waste the money on rebooking tickets instead of rescheduling", "Mom spending a chunk of money might want to double check the dates for the parties involved.\n\nETA: It is possible for parents to exhibit respectful actions to their offspring.", "She is 17 years old not 7! \n\nAnd just because something is important to her mother, doesn't automatically mean, that she has to feel the same way. And if the mother wants to support a dying friend, which is a great thing to do by the way, she can do it, I bet she doesn't need her daughter for that or at least she can rebook her a ticket for two days later!!!", "They want OP to compromise like a bridge gets compromised-it\u2019s breaks under the unyielding weight of a tsunami it can\u2019t escape.", "Especially mothers, and especially between mothers and daughters from my experience.", "It's also possible for teens to understand that Mom doesn't have an extra 500 bucks lying around to accommodate ops prefered flying date.\n\nI don't know what ops plans are so it's not possible imo to say who is the ass. But aita teens live in a parallel universe where money is no object.", "Parents cannot always arrange their life\u2019s around kids (potentially unimportant) event. Their not AH for occasional prioritizing something of extreme importance (which we would know if OP would tell us) to them over something of the kids. \nThis is also disregarding that it may have been much more expensive to flight out another day. Maybe they cannot swing the extra cost, which is why they cancelled. Godforbid OP have to reschedule something to accommodate their parents and possible save them a ton of money. \n\nAlso, by you logic - just because it\u2019s important to the OP doesn\u2019t automatically mean that important to the mom.", "Mom did this to herself. She knew about the plans. I have no sympathy for someone also trying to gaslight their child by saying they need to \"compromise\" when op literally gets nothing and the mom gets what she wants. Pretty gross tbh"]}
