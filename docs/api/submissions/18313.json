You don't give any mention of the trips importance or your plans. That does factor in. And sometimes when you are checking/booking flights, you have to decide at that moment or its going to cost more later or be sold out. To me, it sounds like she told you as soon as she booked it.

She's asking you to compromise but you're really looking forward to your plan.... is it a plan that can be moved more easily than an entire flight/weeklong trip?

If it was something important (prom, graduation, unable to call off work, etc) I'd agree with you but anything else I have to say you're kind of at the whim of the person who purchased the tickets for you, which were probably fairly expensive. It's alright for your mom to be upset that she purchased the tickets and then had to waste money because of your plans, it was kind of her to spend extra to change the tickets in the first place. You'll probably feel differently when you're a little older and start booking your own tickets and realize that little changes can raise the cost a ridiculous amount.

How is it compromising when her solution is you don\u2019t get to do your thing, & y\u2019all only get to do her thing? The compromise would be changing the leave date to the 19th like you suggested.

There are big price differences in tickets depending on when you fight out sometimes.

Many concerned are asking for more info and this deliberate omission of info likely compromises OPs situation. \n\nYes the plans are relevant. Context is relevant. Making your parent spend more money on something they shouldn't have to for a event that can be rescheduled makes OP the TA\n\nBut if OP has solid plans that really can't budge then they are not TA, like a concert, birthday party, something that is date dependant etc\n\nI get autonomy and exercising it, but unless OP opted to not come for any family vacation they shouldn't be dictating the dates around a possibly a plan that could be rescheduled and making others shell out more money than needed.", "Paragraphs man", "NTA.

Does she do this often? Personally I would have been inclined to remind her when you were talking about the date of 24th that you have plans the prior weekend, or to talk to you when she was looking at booking, but I wonder if, given the fact you're still a young adult, she's not kind of engaging with the you being an adult bit of that. It's natural, it happens more times than it doesn't and it's a pain in the a\\*\\* because parent goes 'but I am parent' and you go, but I'm an adult. And this will carry on into your 20s, 30s, 40s whatever because some parents can't get out of the idea that their offspring is a child and not a fully fledged adult. It's hard, because she may mean well, but I also appreciate you don't want to be the person who makes plans and then breaks them. NTA", "NTA. Unlike some of these other people, I don't think what your plans are are relevant.  You had plans set and your mom disrespected that.  You're 17, not 7.

I have definitely zoned out while my husband made plans with his friends as soon as I realized it had nothing to do with me.  \n\n\nAlso, OP is 17 - their friends can do the road trip without them.

Context matters\u2026which again is likely why OP isn\u2019t telling. \n\nAlso you\u2019re disregarding the monitory component- just because OP made plans (possibly easy to reschedule) why should the parents be force to pay extra money?

It makes me think really poorly of teenagers.\n\nOp's plans are going to the beach with friends. If flying out 2 days earlier saves the family $500 you should willingly reschedule your beach weekend.\n\nIf this is a terrible compromise in your mind ok - you do you. I am not your mom so i don't have to convince you that thus is a selfish attitude and shows you don't care much about the family finances.", "I do agree with that, I\u2019m not really arguing that she should have remembered. I think she should have checked. I don\u2019t know who buys plane tickets for others without checking they 100% are available that day, in my personal opinion that\u2019s impulsive and a disaster waiting to happen. I understand the tickets were likely cheaper and that\u2019s a good deal, but still, double checking is key. Hell, when I book flights for myself I triple check to make sure whatever I\u2019m flying out for, like a concert, is 100% on the date I thought it was before I book. Those things aren\u2019t cheap, as we all know, so you gotta be careful.\n\n17 could mean a lot of things but if they\u2019re a senior at 17 then their friends may be gone after summer, off to college. We don\u2019t know if there will be other road trips. I haven\u2019t seen a single high school friend since 2019 because the pandemic hit and then we graduated and all moved away. Life is unfair like that, but OP deserves to have a fun time with their friends. OP could also be the only reason some friends can go, I was often not allowed to go places unless one specific friend was there. Some parents are very strict when it comes to planning. Like I said, OP\u2019s friends plans shouldn\u2019t be ruined because of someone else\u2019s mom.", "Mine isn't an assumption, I'm going with the facts as presented. They may be an unreliable narrator, and we've seen quite a few here, but until we have more knowledge, the story is that the mom wants what she wants and honestly, what compromise could there be. Rescheduling her thing isn't a compromise. That's just mom getting what she wants after she scheduled something without making sure. I'm sorry she lost money but that's her fault", "How though? If it was just her then I\u2019d agree she\u2019s the AH. But her friends are going, and assuming they\u2019re teens like her, it can take a lot of planning to do something like that. Friends may have taken off work for the weekend, or maybe their parents only agreed to that weekend specifically, or maybe considering it\u2019s the summer her friends are going out of town later. Being a teenager, it\u2019s unfair to change plans like that because making plans as a minor is hard as is. \n\nOP\u2019s mom not acknowledging her plans and not checking before buying whole ass plane tickets is not her friend\u2019s problem, nor should it mean they have to reschedule entire plans to work around it since it\u2019s not their problem, and OP deserves to go.", "I agree.", "I agree, I don\u2019t understand why the mom would book the flight without asking her daughter first. But the daughter also had ample time to tell her mom her schedule. She knew the wedding was less than a week away from her plans, but she didn\u2019t speak up about it. A simple \u201cI can attend the wedding trip but I\u2019m busy the 17-18, will that still work?\u201d By daughter in advance would have solved the entire problem", "But the issue is OP\u2019s plans involve other people. It\u2019s not just rescheduling personal stuff, other people have to move around their entire schedule assuming they have other things to do on other weekends, all because OP\u2019s mom couldn\u2019t double check. \n\nAs minors it\u2019s hard to make plans like that as is. Some of them may have summer school, college planning, work they had to take off for the weekend, strict parents\u2026 If OP\u2019s plans were alone then I\u2019d say she\u2019s the AH, but these involve other people and OP\u2019s mom\u2019s poor planning should not be their problem.

Having to reschedule said plans because one person\u2019s mom fucked up is unfair. They might as well just go without OP to avoid rescheduling, which is unfair on OP too. This puts other people in uncomfortable situations.", "But their plans aren\u2019t ruined? OP just doesn\u2019t go to this ONE event. There will be others.

But if they\u2019re doing an overnight trip at a friend\u2019s house, it\u2019s harder to reschedule. If they rented an AirBNB, it\u2019s an AH move to expect her to reschedule. \n\nThere\u2019s not enough context here to determine if OP\u2019s plans really can\u2019t be moved. It\u2019s also still almost a month before the plans, so again - context is important.", "The mom didn't fuck up, she tried to save her family money on airline tickets which vary in pruce based on date. She could have triple checked the plans and that doesnt change the issue that ops orefered  dates are particularly expensive.  Not everyone has an unlimited budget and can easily afford to blow an extra $500 to take am ideal flights.\n\nThese kids are all older teens so this whole other parents are inconvenienced narrative doesn't really make sense. If the teens are allowed to do overnights by themselves at the beach why can't the parents go out of town or a date night and leave their teens at home?", "We don\u2019t know that though is my point. How do you know they aren\u2019t all going away to college? \n\nLike I said, I haven\u2019t seen any school friends in nearly 4 years because of stuff like this.

Most of the time, you unfortunately grow apart from high school friends once going to college.\n\nThere is so little context in this post it\u2019s hard to judge.

But being a teenager is such a unique experience it could literally be anything.", "If mom had been respectful and checked on the dates, we would not be here for this.", "The bottom line is that you are making up reasons to not ask travel companions about dates. Frankly, the fact that you had to go to \"dying of cancer\" tells me plenty about how weak your argument is.", "Again the main event, what is important for her mother is happening on the 24th of June, so why booking so early, by starting at the exact date where their daughter had already made plans. And this journey goes till the 25th of June when I remember it correctly, so why on earth are they forcing their 17 year old daughter to come with them?\n\nWhy can't they leave her alone a few days? I can't wrap my head around the fact that in such posts where this \"kids\" are nearly a legal adult, that their parents never trust them to be home alone for a few days!!!\n\nAnd if they aren't sure she will manage to be on her own for a few days, I am sure there are some family members or family friends who can come by every two or three days to make sure everything is going well!! \n\nThis would also reduce the cost of that trip, when they only need two tickets!!", "You too.", "Yeah, I agree. We don\u2019t know how far the beach is. I lived in a beach town so we could reschedule a beach trip for literally any day without plans. If OP lives in a landlocked state though that probably can\u2019t be rescheduled unless the friends are very flexible. With that said, all parents are different and OP\u2019s friends parents could be extremely strict about planning, or like I said, they took work off for it. Tons of reasons why they may not be able to reschedule, and I still truly do not believe it\u2019s OP\u2019s friends burdens of changing all their schedules because the mom couldn\u2019t simply ask.

My mom would let me go out with my friends if I asked and I could stay out til midnight if I wanted to but she drew the line at going over to people\u2019s houses. Some parents require you inform them of big plans like a roadtrip *months* ahead, and changing those plans might mean they just can\u2019t go. Any good parent would be protective of their kid going on a road trip without them, so a sudden change of plans may just be a no-no. And parents wasn\u2019t my only example.

Sometimes it's neccessary to postpone a sleepover to save $500.\n\n Now if op would have to miss something important - a school concert she had been practing for for months - ok mom should sacrifice and come up w/extra $500.

Money has to come from somewhere.\n\nThat's not about respect- it's about understanding budgets and priorities.", "I\u2019m saying the mom may have even known about the conflict but made an executive decision based on monitory factors and gauging the importance of each event.

That means that the 17th and 18th of June is still available for my own plans (like for OP), so it doesn't matter then, what OPs plans are or if they can be rescheduled earlier or after that trip!

That\u2019s how this sounds to me. NTA in any event.", "NTA. This is open and shut.", "NTA.\n\nI've been through experiences similar to this with my mom before. I understand where you're coming from, and it's about more than money or the simple fact that plans weren't coming together. It's unnecessary guilt on you because of the position she put you in. I would be willing to bet that this kind of \"respect\" conversation has occurred before and will again. Obviously holding a grudge over your mom in this situation isn't the most healthy thing to do, so I wouldn't, but you are NTA for being upset about it and trying to see if there was any way to make it all work. It's not fair for her to decide to change the plans because you were trying to find a different way to make it work out for the both of you, and then blame you like you forced her to do it that way, which you clearly didn't. I completely understand this feeling. You have a right to the respect of just a simple, problem-solving situation without being guilt tripped into feeling like you're the only one who did anything wrong. No. Matter. How. Old. You. Are. NTA.", "This could have totally been avoided if your mother just had a check with you first before making plans say less", "Yeah, they can. She made the plans already, and her mother was there when they were made. She knew the dates her daughter wasn't going to be home and disregarded it.", "First off, the Mom wasn't asking for a compromise, she was just trying to make OP comply. \n\nSecond, she asked her Mom which days, no but her mother failed to include her in the decision, and didn't inform her until much later, even after OP made plans with a friend. \n\nThird, you are expecting OP to act more adult like than the Mom. The Mom is the adult, and should be wise enough to speak to her daughter before buying the tickets. \n\nFourth, she isn't being entitled here, she tried to make the decisions with her Mom, the mom refused. She was more responsible than her mom.", "She didn\u2019t forget. She didn\u2019t care.", "This sounds like someone who is not a parent or hasn\u2019t bought anything as a parent like this. Also pretty clearly, I\u2019m generally agreed with.", "OP assumed her mother knew the plans because she was {very vaguely} there. OP is just as much at fault for not making sure mom knew both what the \u201cevent is irrelevant\u201d per OP and the dates involved. \nI think OP is much more TYA than mom based solely on her refusal to tell this forum what the plans involve.", "I listen to people I care about and use the calander app in my phone so my plans don't interfere with theirs. If their mother actually listened to and cared about what they were doing then they never would have booked the flight during their end of high-school Beach trip. I have some bad news for you, being a parent doesn't give you a pass to be a selfish dickbag. Hitler had a lot of people that shared similar views and agreed with him too. It doesn't make him right.", "mom: OP change your event plans\n\nThat isn't a compromise.", "Yeah, I agree. Most people just want more information so they can make an informed \"ruling\" but right now I'm leaning towards NTA because of that \"compromise\" situation.", "That isn't a compromise though.\n\nAnd also, this is purely the Mom's fault. She should have checked and still has the option to change the tickets. Not only that, generally it's more expensive the closer you are to the present, so pushing back two days shouldn't make it 500 more dollars, normally.", "It specifically says she asked her Mom, and she didn't tell her until after she had booked them.", "Mom should have asked before buying anything as well. \n\nShe did eventually tell plans and honestly I never cared and thought it was weird how so caught up on that fact. \n\nMom didn't ask just made plans. And the whole compromise gaslighting is a whole other issue and blatantly disrespectful. It's not a compromise if one party gets everything they want and the other nothing.", "So you\u2019re bring up Hitler now, yeah you\u2019re a sane person with relevant points worthy of being listened to. No thanks.", "First off, apologies. I thought you were OP. Second, not necessarily Mom's responsibility, especially if daughter never explicitly said \"Please do not book before the 19th as it's my friend's party.\" Mom may have been there when she made the plans, but if they're personal, that doesn't mean the information was absorbed into her brain. OP had the opportunity to explicitly express her desire to have the 17th and 18th open and has not stated anything that I've seen to make me believe she has. This opinion is also coming from someone who made plans to attend a teammate's party at her age only for Mom to book a college tour on the same day. It sucks, but OP really should have spoken up if the plans were personal.\n\nETA: It's a road trip to the beach. My opinion still stands. She had the opportunity to remind her mom of the dates and didn't. You can say Mom sucks, but OP is being entitled. My judgement is YTA.", "Pretty sure I stated this above but I'll restate it.   \n\n\nOP is the definition of an unreliable narrator. They choose to give zero details about what their plans were, nor did they give ANY information  about what was discussed as a compromise. Those gaps contain critical information and the omission indicates that they likely don't paint OP in a good light. Eg: OP is planning a movie night with friends. Mom asks to compromise by offering a different date/use of vehicle later/even paying for it. OP comes back and says \"mom said to compromise by changing it\" and gives nothing. That colours it all very differently.  \n\n\nBut, also as said before, you are an individual with your personal opinion and I am an individual with mine. I fail to see why you are trying to change my opinion/perspective on this when it is clearly an AITA question and I have clearly voted YTA based on my interpretation of the information both given and not given.   \nGo ahead and vote your vote and enjoy your evening.", "There\u2019s a wedding? I didn\u2019t see that anywhere in the comments. If so is the daughter an attendant, because if so there could be several events happening during that full week. Most certainly there would be fittings and such.", "Sounds like a good analogy to show just because people agree with you doesn't make you right. But sure, gloss over the parts that make sense and hyperfocus on the one thing you can argue with to dismiss what I said.", "Being upset because someone disagrees with you on a public forum is your first problem.\n\nSecond, she gave the information up after being asked. If she really intended to try to trick us, she easily could have just not said or even lied about the plans, saying a graduation or something.\n\nThird, plenty of people, and especially parents demand you change something and then call it a compromise. \n\nFourth, OP said they tried to talk about this, but her Mom refused, even after witnessing the plans.", "I don't see where it says the tickets will be 500 or that pushing it back would make it more expensive.", "Oh dear... you think I'm \"upset\" because I don't get why you would bother to reply and \"correct\" me (bring me around to their thinking which can be the only correct response?) hours later.  \n1. you don't know me so I guess you don't know I'm not upset. Enough time had passed that I (incorrectly) assumed people would give their own replies and not bother trying to change my opinion because opinions aren't facts so why would you bother after so much time? Or at all? Are you so invested. Please vote for yourself and allow others to do the same.  \n2. There was no information the last time I bothered to read it, which was, admittedly, a while ago. This hasn't claimed my evening, I just happen to be on here now and see your reply coming in.  \n3. Many parents will do that, however, I wrote my response based on my own experience as a sentient human being. I'm allowed to do that.   \n4. OP is 17. I was 17 once, I remember it. I remember my opinions being coloured based on my life as a 17 year old, and I voted reflecting that and the apparently intentional vagueness of the post itself. My vote for YTA remains intact.   \n\n\nI won't reply again to you. I will, once again, wish you a good evening (as it is evening in my timezone) and hope that whatever endeavours you choose to partake in bring you joy or, at least, satisfaction.", "Exactly. It\u2019s just a tough one to judge because of the missing context. I can see it going either way; that said, if flights were $500 cheaper on a Thursday versus a Saturday, that\u2019s out of mom\u2019s control and a very good reason to book the cheaper tickets.", "Saying \"I'm allowed to do that\" is meaningless. Bad opinions are bad regardless of whether you can or can't make them.\n\nAlso, you seem pretty upset that people are replying to you.", "Definitely don\u2019t disagree it\u2019s a good reason. That\u2019s a great deal. I think the bottom line that even OP\u2019s mom would agree with now is to just check. Hell, even on my trips I go on by myself I triple check the dates before booking flights. One thing goes wrong and sorry, you\u2019re out hundreds of dollars *and* you don\u2019t get to go on a trip\n\nHopefully OP clears stuff up so it\u2019s easier to judge but who knows", "YTA. A beach day with your friends isn't some kind of unmissable opportunity or something that can't be rescheduled. You've caused your mother a lot of aggravation and some money because you didn't want to go back into the groupchat? Boohoo.", "Nta. Who books tickets without making sure it works for all parties involved???", "NTA, your mom was crying about compromise when a compromise could have been met by her rescheduling during the 24 hours she had to reschedule. That sounds frustrating, I'm sorry.", "YTA Try paying for the trip and cancellation fees yourself, because your mom wanted to go to the beach with her friends, and see how you feel. This is very entitled, should behavior. If your money was wasted like that, you would be crying too.", "NTA why was she being so cagey about the dates? Also, I hate it when the other parent (Dad in this case) refuses to take sides. It\u2019s so lazy. Having someone with less skin in the argument would have been helpful in meditating this.", "NTA. A) she knew you had made plans that weekend, and b) who makes plans WITH OTHER PEOPLE and doesn't confirm when they are free before booking dates? That's just basic respect and common sense. Your mom was very inconsiderate and you have every right to be upset.", "I\u2019m leaning towards NTA, mostly because Mom crying is such a bizarre response to their teenager being a teenager.", "Frankly the nature of the plans is irrelevant.  She could have just not wanted to go anywhere on those dates.  Mom screwed up by not communicating before spending money and then got pissy when she had to deal with the consequences.", "Depends on the state. Funnily enough, TX actually considers you an adult at 17.", "OP's plans could have been to sit around and eat iranian yogurt for two days straight and it still wouldn't change he core issue.  Mom decided to just make the arrangements without consulting the people that were going.  Having to reschedule and losing the money is a consequence of her poor planning.", "They weren't answering because they were at work as stated in an update. You do know that people work at jobs that don't allow phones out right?", "Her mom is paying for her own mistake.  She didn't ask about availability prior to booking and had to eat a financial loss because of it.", "I totally agree with you. Reading this comments where people are saying she\u2019s not an asshole are mind boggling to me.", "I see a bigger thing. You're getting to an age when you can legitimately make your own plans and prioritize people other than your family. I think your mom knew about your plans. She wanted you to pick her.\n\nIf I am right, then she is going to struggle to let go. If you have a good relationship with her, then it's time for a heart to heart.", "She literally says in the comments her friends have planned a weekend road trip to the beach. It isn\u2019t a conspiracy, Jesus", "She clearly states in the post that she told mom she had plans and mom didn't care.", "OP says that at the time of making the plans mom \u201cwas there\u201d which could mean mom was in the same room talking to other people, taking a nap on the couch, or helping make the plans. We don\u2019t know if OP actually specifically told mom *before* mom booked the flights; we only know that she did *after*", "They actually updated the post and noted that they weren't replying because they were at work, but k."]}
