I was by my doctor, cause I have urinary tract infection, so she could give me meds. Just so you know, I don\u2019t have any infectious disease, I don\u2019t throw up, don\u2019t have fever or cough. Just pain in my lower stonach, nothing more serious. \nIt\u2019s december and ofc the waiting room was full. I\u2019m 18, so I still have \u201cchild doctor\u201d. There were like 6 parents with children waiting, so I sitted down and texted friend. \n\nAnd suddenly I heard \u201cgagging\u201d. I looked up and saw a boy was throwing up. And don\u2019t take me wrong, but I would rather break my leg, than throw up. I just hate so incredibly much I can\u2019t describe it. I tried to ignore it so badly. Played a game, tried to \u201cinconspicuously\u201d cover my ears and nothing helped. The worst thing was, he threw up for like 3 minutes in row. He\u2019s started crying that he can\u2019t breathe and so on.\nI just couldn\u2019t listen to it anymore, and got out of the waiting room to the hall. Trust me, if I stayed there for 30 more seconds I would throw up too. \n\nHere\u2019s the issue. Spent few minutes in the hall, and than the boy and mother came out of the waiting room cause the doc took them \u201cprioritly\u201d or something. I sat there, and the mother looked at me with judging face and said \u201cYou made my son feel uncomfortable when you left. He felt like it\u2019s his fault.\u201d I must say, I was speechless at the moment. Really didn\u2019t know what to say. The boy stand there looking like he absolutely didn\u2019t care about someone leaving the room and just wanted/needed to go home. Afterwards she told him to sit down, next to me. I stand up (for my own health) and said \u201cYep, don\u2019t worry about it, I\u2019m gonna make you space.\u201d I said it nicely, not ironicaly, I really meant it, I saw he wasn\u2019t feeling well, but just didn\u2019t want myself to get infected. I politely said goodbye and went back to the waiting room. Guys. If you saw those judging faces. They all were killing me with their faces.\n\nSo, AITA for leaving, when I felt triggred to throwing up? For not dealing with the sound of vomiting? Was I supposed to stay there and threw up with him?!?\n\nThank youuu", "created_utc": 1671059044, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zm54el/aita_for_leaving_the_waiting_room_when_someone/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why would you not be grossed upon someone throwing up a few meters from you ? Yes it\u2019s not this kid\u2019s fault that he did throw up, but still, I wouldn\u2019t have remained either and he was actually the reason why you left. If it were an adult throwing up, he would have apologised to everyone in the room. My guess is that the either the parent did say nasty comments before leaving the waiting room, or the child was actually feeling very guilty and warmed everyone\u2019s heart, which automatically made you the villain for no reason.
