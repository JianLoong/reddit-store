He works a physical job and generally wears clothes that tend to retain bad odors. From the very beginning he didn't care to present himself as clean, I would feel his BO and notice when we would spend the weekend together he wouldn't shower at all (not even wipe himself with some baby wipes). He didn't use a deodorant so the smell would be very noticeable after a day, especially two.\n\nSo I began telling him \"Hey, I need the bathroom for a while, do you need to shower or something?\" just to hint that a shower is an activity in life. He'd just say no. I did this for some time but ultimately I just became frustrated and started telling him I noticed he doesn't really shower or uses a deodorant. So he started using a deodorant but that didn't really help much as he's one of those people who just have a combined smell of perfume and sweat when using a deodorant (I'm the same, which is why I take care of showering and changing my shirts often, and experimenting with different deos). \n\nI do not want to force him to use a deodorant as I fully understand people not wanting to use deos filled with chemicals and whatnot. But there are alternatives...like showering and wearing clean clothes, using natural deodorants etc.\n\nWe're still in the beginning of our relationship and I would love to be able to cuddle with him or initiate sex without worrying how many times he went to the can without showering. I do not want to have sex with him not washing his ass for two days straight. \n\nSometimes he would initiate but I would just say I'm not in the mood. After some time I bluntly told him that if he doesn't shower and he went to take a shit in the meantime, I don't want to have sex with him. I also don't want to cuddle under his smelly armpit either. I told him the same about washing his hands before sex. He'd eat chips and then put his hand in my pants. Yeah, I don't think so. As someone who had big problems down there, this is not debatable.\n\nHe didn't change his habits at all and I'm starting to feel like this could be a deal breaker for me. Not necessarily for the smell/cleanliness but more so because he could give two shits about how I feel. And it's not that he doesn't have the time. He comes home around 4, and plays games for 5 hours. But that's whole 'nother story.\n\nI know it's his body and I can't make him shower but is it really too much to ask for your SO to be clean and fresh? And if it bothers me, why is it so hard for him to adopt a habit that is generally considered the norm? Anyway, if you all decide I'm the asshole, I will accept it but it will not change how I feel about his \"habits\" and would probably need to think if I can get over this or not. Thx for reading.\n\nEdit: I also see how I could sound like a clean sex nut but I really don't think I am. If we both shower every day, all the drama can be avoided and I'll do all kinds of nasty stuff with him.", "created_utc": 1669804473, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z8o6xr/aita_for_wanting_my_bf_to_shower_more_often/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not showering for a day or two or recycling some clothing for a few days is not the end of the world when you don't work a laborous job. But your partner does, and that means that he's bringing not only bad smells, but contaminants from his job into your spaces (i.e. food, drinks, sheets, *your* body). \n\nAnd it seems like this is a full hygiene issue, not just a showering issue. \n\nIf he can't understand why this bothers you, I think its time to move on.", ">He doesn't like showering.  \n>  \n>he didn't care to present himself as clean  \n>  \n>He didn't use a deodorant   \n>  \n>I also don't want to cuddle under his smelly armpit  \n>  \n>He'd eat chips and then put his hand in my pants.  \n>  \n>He comes home around 4, and plays games for 5 hours.\n\nNTA.

Hope he's rich or something...", "NTA. My dad was like this when he first married my mom. He worked in a pizza parlor and wouldn't shower at the end of the day. Yeah, imagine that.  And she got it because he was tired after a long day, but she put her foot down and said, \"Take at least 15 minutes in the shower with soap. Please.\" That was all. Being hygienic is not optional. There's a reason humans bathe. It's not just for aesthetic reasons. Tell him you love him but you're worried about getting an infection if he's not clean. Women have different parts, which means different flora - most of which are sensitive to dirtiness!", "NTA but I gotta wonder what's going on in your head getting together with a man who you knew from the start does not wash himself", "NTA. That would be my criteria for getting in the same bed as me lol. He doesn\u2019t seem to understand that you are thinking this is a deal breaker. Nothing sexy about sweat, smell and dirt in the bedroom. You need to have a good talk to him. Be direct and to the point because either he didn\u2019t get the hint or he doesn\u2019t care.", "NTA, but this is probably somewhere you should give him a direct ultimatum. Either he showers, or you leave. He also might need to see a therapist. Not showering is a big sign of depression.

I shower every morning and her deodorant daily. I even keep deodorant in my jeep great job weekends i usually go hiking and buy the time i get back go the jeep in sweaty and stinky do i change my shirt and use deodorant. \n\nIt's basic hygiene. I did not shower daily... But then again i was 12. Tell him that at this point be probably doesn't notice but he NEEDS go shower daily. I cannot think of any way to sugarcoat it", "NTA, but why not just come out straight and tell him? This is not about being a \"clean freak\", but there are just several red flags, especially if you have history with infections or similar issues. I'd really recommend to just be open about these issues, tell him. I can't imagine what my wife would say I didn't shower for two days and then tried to get in her pants, she'd probably straight on asked me if I was mental, doesn't matter if I was just sitting around or did physically demanding work.", "NTA hygiene is really important, especially for us women.

Who the hell needs to be nagged at 30+ to shower?! Time to dump him.", "NTA - Having sex with him is a good way for you to get a UTI. It might be a little different if he worked in an office and showered every second day, but manual labor is a different story. This is a hill to die on.", "NTA. Compatibility issue.", "NTA he sounds gross. Just leave him and find someone who won't give you an infection", "NTA and honestly run. My bf grew up in a farm and now has a desk job so in his head he doesn't really need to shower so often now. But if I say he stinks a bit he will jump in that shower. That being said whenever we go to his parents house and he works outside he showers, he'll shower two or three times if needed. \nAs you said very clearly, he doesn't give two shits about how you feel if this is important for you and he just doesn't care. You're not asking for anything strange or difficult, just to be clean and he can't do it? You had a conversation and he still won't change. What other things in the future will he not care about that you ask if him?", "sleeping in filth is so gross. that\u2019s a no from me. i\u2019m a SAHM and can go two days without showering during the winter when we don\u2019t go outside and play or something and be fine. but i change ALL my clothes before getting into bed and will wash my sheets before i get into bed clean. bacteria lives on our skin. he\u2019s just spreading that where ever he sits or touches. and holy shit, as far as sex - no one has time for cheeto dust in their lady bits. that sounds like 2 extra trips to the gynecologist no one wants to take. fuck. that.

I'm gonna go against the grain here and it probably won't be popular but ESH. No, absolutely not because you asked him to shower. That's more than reasonable. You suck because, WTF are you doing? You talked to him already.  You told him how you felt. He didn't care. So instead of leaving, you're on here asking if you're an asshole? You've been together for 5 months. It's not like you're going on 25 years together. This isn't about him being noxious. \n\nTaking a shower everyday isn't necessary honestly. If you take a shower everyday, you strip your skin of natural oils. Taking a shower once every other day is good. Body odor occurs when your sweat mixes with bacteria. You naturally have bacteria on your skin. If he wants to risk infections, that's on him but why are you still hanging around? Did this behavior only start to occur after you got together? If he was always like this since you got together, why are you on here? It wasn't a deal breaker when you got together and YOU'RE STILL WITH HIM. \n\nYour boyfriend suck for all the obvious reasons but sorry, you're not entirely guiltless in this. Just leave already.", "Soft YTA. If you don't like stinky dudes then don't date a stinky dude. If it's this much of a problem this early in the relationship then it's probably something you shouldn't have overlooked. You're expecting him to change his habits when maybe you just shouldn't be dating him in the first place.\n\nI work with a lot of smelly guys and they all have girlfriends.

The way I see it is....everybody is free to take care of their hygiene as they please, but you guys are together. His lack of hygiene affects you. You're not a control freak for having criteria in what goes in contact/inside your body. You can tell him, of course. But the fact that you have to constantly remind him of it...I don't know...after only 5 months I would ask myself if it's worth. I would love my partner to have the initiative to want to feel nice and clean for me, the same way that I'd take care of being fresh and clean myself when I'm with them. The fact that he spends 5h playing video games but it doesn't come naturally to him to wash himself after a long day doing physical work...it's so off putting for me.", "Well thanks for making me laugh :D\nHe is not homeless, thankfully. Just careless it seems.", "Deep down (well not even that deep) I know it too. I am maybe just still \"giving it a chance\", not wanting to give up too soon (as I've been accused of in the past).", "Thank you.", "This, 100%. There is a big difference between two days not showering, and having showered 3 hours ago, especially when you have a physicall demanding job.", "There's nothing wrong with your English! \nThanks for your input :)", "Thanks for your objecive perspective. I will definitely still talk to him about this, hopefully we will work it our. Otherwise I have some decisions to make.", "Next time you see him, you're gonna have a Spice Girls song stuck in your head, you're welcome.\n\nHmm.. ok you really like this guy somehow. Have you been intimate before? If so... and bear with me... could you ask him to, idk, shower *with* you?\n\nSometimes my husband gets home stinky and exhausted. He really works hard and sometimes all I can do is hop in the shower with him and scrub him down with the loofah before he's passes out. It's not about sex in this scenario, more about caring for my other half. If you've been intimate before, maybe lure him into the shower and hold him down and scrub his ass. Idk.\n\nI have two teenage boys and the most I ever had to do was to make them smell the armpits of their own shirts and tell them EVERYONE ELSE CAN SMELL THAT.", "He\u2019s in his 30\u2019s and doesn\u2019t shower daily \u2026. Give up!!!   Give up!!  I give you permission to give up!   \ud83d\ude06", ">(as I've been accused of in the past).\n\nWho is saying this, and why do they want you to suffer?  What purpose does it serve them to see you unhappy?  It feels like the kind of thing a parent would say when they equate you giving up the violin at age six to leaving a relationship that isn't working for you and is causing you pain. \n\nIf you need to hear it I will say it.  It's OK to change. It's OK to change your mind.  Tolerating uncomfortable situations or relationships is not an amazing moral value in itself. It's very OK to leave relationships when they are harmful to you, or if they don't work (or for any reason at all).", "Go see a therapist. Are you fucking kidding me? You deserve better than this. The bar is set damn low and this guy is still worse. You have this one life and your wasting time on a guy who stinks up your bed, puts his dirty hands on your genitals, and prefers 5 hours of video games over you. And he\u2019s in his 30s! And you\u2019re in your 30s! Have some self respect.", "Haha thank you!", "Thank you so much for that. My friends and family have been saying this to me so much I started to believe them :/"]}
