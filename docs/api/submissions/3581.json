I am a bit embarrassed because it seems like I am in fact an asshole for thinking I'm an asshole in this situation.... I'm like those oblivious posters who ask if it's ok to dump a cheating partner...\n\nMy BF and I(both early 30s) have been together for 5 months.\n\nHe doesn't like showering. He works a physical job and generally wears clothes that tend to retain bad odors. From the very beginning he didn't care to present himself as clean, I would feel his BO and notice when we would spend the weekend together he wouldn't shower at all (not even wipe himself with some baby wipes). He didn't use a deodorant so the smell would be very noticeable after a day, especially two.\n\nSo I began telling him \"Hey, I need the bathroom for a while, do you need to shower or something?\" just to hint that a shower is an activity in life. He'd just say no. I did this for some time but ultimately I just became frustrated and started telling him I noticed he doesn't really shower or uses a deodorant. So he started using a deodorant but that didn't really help much as he's one of those people who just have a combined smell of perfume and sweat when using a deodorant (I'm the same, which is why I take care of showering and changing my shirts often, and experimenting with different deos). \n\nI do not want to force him to use a deodorant as I fully understand people not wanting to use deos filled with chemicals and whatnot. But there are alternatives...like showering and wearing clean clothes, using natural deodorants etc.\n\nWe're still in the beginning of our relationship and I would love to be able to cuddle with him or initiate sex without worrying how many times he went to the can without showering. I do not want to have sex with him not washing his ass for two days straight. \n\nSometimes he would initiate but I would just say I'm not in the mood. After some time I bluntly told him that if he doesn't shower and he went to take a shit in the meantime, I don't want to have sex with him. I also don't want to cuddle under his smelly armpit either. I told him the same about washing his hands before sex. He'd eat chips and then put his hand in my pants. Yeah, I don't think so. As someone who had big problems down there, this is not debatable.\n\nHe didn't change his habits at all and I'm starting to feel like this could be a deal breaker for me. Not necessarily for the smell/cleanliness but more so because he could give two shits about how I feel. And it's not that he doesn't have the time. He comes home around 4, and plays games for 5 hours. But that's whole 'nother story.\n\nI know it's his body and I can't make him shower but is it really too much to ask for your SO to be clean and fresh? And if it bothers me, why is it so hard for him to adopt a habit that is generally considered the norm? Anyway, if you all decide I'm the asshole, I will accept it but it will not change how I feel about his \"habits\" and would probably need to think if I can get over this or not. Thx for reading.\n\nEdit: I also see how I could sound like a clean sex nut but I really don't think I am. If we both shower every day, all the drama can be avoided and I'll do all kinds of nasty stuff with him.", "created_utc": 1669804473, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z8o6xr/aita_for_wanting_my_bf_to_shower_more_often/", "score": 177, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not showering for a day or two or recycling some clothing for a few days is not the end of the world when you don't work a laborous job. But your partner does, and that means that he's bringing not only bad smells, but contaminants from his job into your spaces (i.e. food, drinks, sheets, *your* body). \n\nAnd it seems like this is a full hygiene issue, not just a showering issue. \n\nIf he can't understand why this bothers you, I think its time to move on.", ">He doesn't like showering.  \n>  \n>he didn't care to present himself as clean  \n>  \n>He didn't use a deodorant   \n>  \n>I also don't want to cuddle under his smelly armpit  \n>  \n>He'd eat chips and then put his hand in my pants.  \n>  \n>He comes home around 4, and plays games for 5 hours.\n\nNTA. Also, sorry - I missed the part in this story where you said what was keeping you in this relationship? For him, you seem to be more of a convenience than an actual person.", "Why would you stay with someone or even get involved with someone with no hygiene?", "NTA, but *please* ask yourself why you\u2019re twisting yourself in knots over a totally reasonable expectation and just **tell** him you can\u2019t continue to date someone who has this casual an attitude toward hygiene.  If you feel weird about asking this, it\u2019s because you shouldn\u2019t have to ask, not because you\u2019re wrong for wanting it.", "NTA and what the hell you're doing with this guy?? Hope he's rich or something...", "NTA. My dad was like this when he first married my mom. He worked in a pizza parlor and wouldn't shower at the end of the day. Yeah, imagine that.  And she got it because he was tired after a long day, but she put her foot down and said, \"Take at least 15 minutes in the shower with soap. Please.\" That was all. Being hygienic is not optional. There's a reason humans bathe. It's not just for aesthetic reasons. Tell him you love him but you're worried about getting an infection if he's not clean. Women have different parts, which means different flora - most of which are sensitive to dirtiness!", "NTA but I gotta wonder what's going on in your head getting together with a man who you knew from the start does not wash himself", "NTA. That would be my criteria for getting in the same bed as me lol. He doesn\u2019t seem to understand that you are thinking this is a deal breaker. Nothing sexy about sweat, smell and dirt in the bedroom. You need to have a good talk to him. Be direct and to the point because either he didn\u2019t get the hint or he doesn\u2019t care.", "NTA, but this is probably somewhere you should give him a direct ultimatum. Either he showers, or you leave. He also might need to see a therapist. Not showering is a big sign of depression. That doesn't *excuse* it, but it could *explain* it. \n\nI have trouble making myself shower as well, so this is coming from someone who gets it. \n\nHe also might like baths more than showers. \n\nBut anyway, NTA.", "NTA. He isn\u2019t making an effort towards even the bare minimum of hygiene. Asking someone to not be filthy and stinking is nat assholeish at all. It seems unlikely he\u2019s going to change though so I (personally) would consider this a deal breaker.", "Nta\n\nHe should shower daily especially of he has a more physical job. I shower every morning and her deodorant daily. I even keep deodorant in my jeep great job weekends i usually go hiking and buy the time i get back go the jeep in sweaty and stinky do i change my shirt and use deodorant. \n\nIt's basic hygiene. I did not shower daily... But then again i was 12. Tell him that at this point be probably doesn't notice but he NEEDS go shower daily. I cannot think of any way to sugarcoat it", "NTA, but why not just come out straight and tell him? This is not about being a \"clean freak\", but there are just several red flags, especially if you have history with infections or similar issues. I'd really recommend to just be open about these issues, tell him. I can't imagine what my wife would say I didn't shower for two days and then tried to get in her pants, she'd probably straight on asked me if I was mental, doesn't matter if I was just sitting around or did physically demanding work.", "NTA hygiene is really important, especially for us women. Apart from the whole smell/odor thing, his dirty male parts are really dangerous for you. Touching you with dirty hands? Hell no. I'm also worried about his overall habits. Does he contaminate food as well?\n\nHe may perfect in other aspects, but between jeopardising your health and dismissing your feelings, I think this relationship is doomed.", "NTA. Just gross. Why are you with him? Dump him.", "My dudes, it's not gay to wash your butt and hole. And AXE is not shower in a can. OP, I wish you well. NTA", "NTA. It's perfectly reasonable to want to have sex with someone who doesn't have sticky fingers and smelly ass.

You should not have to beg a grown man to have good hygiene.", "NTA for literally asking the bare minimum. Your bf is TA for being unhygienic and disgusting. Who the hell needs to be nagged at 30+ to shower?! Time to dump him.", "NTA - Having sex with him is a good way for you to get a UTI. It might be a little different if he worked in an office and showered every second day, but manual labor is a different story. This is a hill to die on.", "NTA. Compatibility issue.", "NTA he sounds gross. Just leave him and find someone who won't give you an infection", "NTA and honestly run. My bf grew up in a farm and now has a desk job so in his head he doesn't really need to shower so often now. But if I say he stinks a bit he will jump in that shower. That being said whenever we go to his parents house and he works outside he showers, he'll shower two or three times if needed. \nAs you said very clearly, he doesn't give two shits about how you feel if this is important for you and he just doesn't care. You're not asking for anything strange or difficult, just to be clean and he can't do it? You had a conversation and he still won't change. What other things in the future will he not care about that you ask if him?", "sleeping in filth is so gross. that\u2019s a no from me. i\u2019m a SAHM and can go two days without showering during the winter when we don\u2019t go outside and play or something and be fine. but i change ALL my clothes before getting into bed and will wash my sheets before i get into bed clean. bacteria lives on our skin. he\u2019s just spreading that where ever he sits or touches. and holy shit, as far as sex - no one has time for cheeto dust in their lady bits. that sounds like 2 extra trips to the gynecologist no one wants to take. fuck. that. (is that a pun?)", "Nta but it\u2019s only been 5 months, cut your losses and break up", "INFO: is he depressed? Does he have a history of depression? How often does he shower?", "Ok. I'm gonna go against the grain here and it probably won't be popular but ESH. No, absolutely not because you asked him to shower. That's more than reasonable. You suck because, WTF are you doing? You talked to him already.  You told him how you felt. He didn't care. So instead of leaving, you're on here asking if you're an asshole? You've been together for 5 months. It's not like you're going on 25 years together. This isn't about him being noxious. \n\nTaking a shower everyday isn't necessary honestly. If you take a shower everyday, you strip your skin of natural oils. Taking a shower once every other day is good. Body odor occurs when your sweat mixes with bacteria. You naturally have bacteria on your skin. If he wants to risk infections, that's on him but why are you still hanging around? Did this behavior only start to occur after you got together? If he was always like this since you got together, why are you on here? It wasn't a deal breaker when you got together and YOU'RE STILL WITH HIM. \n\nYour boyfriend suck for all the obvious reasons but sorry, you're not entirely guiltless in this. Just leave already.", "Soft YTA. If you don't like stinky dudes then don't date a stinky dude. If it's this much of a problem this early in the relationship then it's probably something you shouldn't have overlooked. You're expecting him to change his habits when maybe you just shouldn't be dating him in the first place.\n\nI work with a lot of smelly guys and they all have girlfriends. I always wondered what kind of women put up with that nastiness. There's plenty of guys out there that wash their ass regularly.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
