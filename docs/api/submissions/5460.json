Am I wrong in thinking that the polite thing to do would have been her telling us to go without her?

I believe she has every intention to go with you when she commits.\n\nI'd continue to invite her, maybe saying that you understand if that day things change for her but you're still going to go, and then have games nights at whatever frequency works for you so she still has the social time. \n\nIt sounds like you care about her a lot, so having scheduled games nights and inviting her to other things but going without her if she cancels is the best middle ground", "NTA and you didn't make a mistake posting that photo.  You do what you want to do with your life.  If you stop posting stuff because you are worried about what a friend \"might\" do, then you are living in co-dependency.  You aren't responsible for her happiness, and you shouldn't wait for your happiness until she has hers.\n\nYou have not been unreasonable.  If you want BBQ and a friend is a vegetarian, you don't expect them to come.  If you want to go parachuting but your friend fears heights of course you don't invite her.  She is taking offense when there is none being offered.  And that is probably part of the illness.  So you can have compassion for her, but you don't owe her staying home.\n\nJust because someone is upset doesn't mean you did anything wrong.  Part of having healthy boundaries means others might be upset when you do what you want.", "NTA  You didn't exclude her. You have learned from past experiences that your friend doesn't enjoy crowds. If she wants to stay home that's perfectly fine. But it's not okay to ask all of you to stay home.", "NTA at all. If someone continually cancels, backs out at the last minute, makes the entire group cater to them, or forces last minute changes eventually they will not be invited to future events. \n\nIt is extremely unfortunate that her mental health is preventing her from doing fun activities with y\u2019all but it also seems after reading this that this all could also be affecting your happiness and mental health. Plan periodic game nights to spend time with her comfortably and specific outings that she can choose to attend or not. But continue with your plans whether she comes out or not, it\u2019s not fair for you to sacrifice your social life for someone else.", "NTA. Your friend seems a bit self-centered. Just explain to her the reality: every time y\u2019all try to go out publicly, she\u2019s uncomfortable. No one can expect to be continually invited to something when their answer has always previously been no. I have a feeling that later in life you will find out this friend is not really a friend.

That said, it is not fair for her to expect you all to cancel planned activities altogether when that occurs. \n\nMaybe approach it more as an offer for her to participate when things are planned, if she can go great, but if not no hard feelings on either side while the rest of you do the planned activity. \n\nThe flip of this would be to also plan the more simple board game nights that she does participate in. Maybe reserve a certain day or days a month for low-key nights in together.", "NTA for wanting to go out and do things. You don\u2019t always need to take everyone in a big group. \n\nBut it sounds like you need to have a straightforward conversation with Laura and (with kindness and compassion) tell her how you feel. Say that you still want to invite her places, but she should understand that if she doesn\u2019t feel up to it on the day of, the others will still be going because they were looking forward to it.\n\nAnd if that does happen, consider not posting excessively to social media, to spare her feelings.

It\u2018a okay to grow apart, and also to have different lifestyles as friends. Communicate this, based on your post I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be empathetic. She\u2019s being stubborn about her needs and wants. Which is important when someone has a mental illness, but you have to look out for yourself and not have to fear reactions or walk on eggshells around another. You\u2019re not an AH but try to resolve it, if she wants to keep being invited but not show up that\u2019s also fine - but if it seems like she\u2019s bending your plans and social desires to her wishes, it is very unfair to you.", "NTA", "stand up for yourself-you can hang out w whoever, whenever! NTA, don\u2019t be scared into moderating your posts for another person", "NTA. You're allowed to do your shopping where/when/with whom you choose. But I'm wondering if you've had an open and honest conversation with your friend about feeling conflicted by your desire to support her and your own wants and needs. It's OK to let her know in advance that if she always wants to stay in that sometimes you'll do that with her and sometimes you'll be going out.", "NTA. But as someone who has been this friend, please communicate your frustration to her kindly. Maybe you can both agree that you\u2019ll accept the fact that she might cancel on you sometimes because of her mental health but that at the same time, you might want to make more reliable plans with other friends sometimes.", "So.. here's the thing. I tend to be that friend who happily agrees to plans, and then as the day draws near, my anxiety often gets the best of me and I end up cancelling. I hate it, but I can't help it. With that said (and this is in my case alone, not necessarily your friend) if I push myself to go, I often have fun. \n\nHOWEVER. It is unrealistic and selfish of her to get upset if you do things without her. That's not fair. \n\nNTA. She is using her mental health issues to manipulate you into staying within her comfort zone with no regards to your feelings, and that's not okay. She can't expect everything to be her way only.", "NAH yet.  \n\nYou need to sit down with your friend and have a serious conversation to lay out expectations moving forward. Reiterate that you love her and love spending time with her and want to continue to make plans that include her, but that while you respect and understand if she can\u2019t actually do those plans on the day of, you won\u2019t be changing your plans and staying home. \n\nI\u2019m not a bar/club person. Never have been. I\u2019m miserable, I melt down, I just can\u2019t handle the loudness and people. And my friends know that I\u2019m going to say \u201cthank you but have fun without me\u201d.  And I\u2019m not going to resent them because they are having fun and I\u2019m sitting at home with a book. I also know that if I\u2019m having a bad mental health day, I may miss out on something fun, and that\u2019s not my friends fault or their responsibility to cance their plans to take care of me. \n\nIf she knows she\u2019s not up to going out ahead of time, she needs to be upfront about that. She also needs to understand and accept that if you have delayed doing something that you want to do (especially something with a limited time frame) to accommodate her, you will continue with those plans even if she has to cancel. \n\nIt\u2019s not wrong to continue to live your life while simultaneously respecting her limitations. Neither of you is entitled to control the other. And that includes you not being able to force her to go out AND her not being able to force you to stay in.", "NTA, every time she is invited to an activity she completely reroutes it to what she wants. She's not trying to punish you for not hanging out with her? You don't need to invite your entire friend group every single time you need to do an individual activity. It just sounds like she's trying to trick you into believing that you're not allowed to do anything without her so she can avoid doing her personal work to ensure she is invited to more things. \n\nIf all she has to do is put in the mental work into tricking all of you into believing you have to invite her to every single thing, then she doesn't have to put in any of the bigger work in to addressing her issues.", "NTA. A friend and I are going through something similar with one of our friends - all enthusiasm,  then cancels day of. We're at the point of do we even bother inviting them any more, or do so with the knowledge they probably won't come? \n\nI know that mental healthy struggles are real and there are some events I have had to back out of because I just couldn't.  But you need to live your life too. Maybe make plans and tell Laura that this is the plan (shopping/market/whatever) and you'd appreciate her company, but this is the plan. And keep doing the game nights that you know she can do.", "NTA. It was just quick shopping, and she seemed to consistently cancel, so it's not your fault.", "NTA\n\nIt seems like your friend is enjoying being able to control your ability to have fun. If she is, then she's self medicating with that power. Fighting her depression doesn't mean controlling you in-order to get her mind off of her depression.", "NTA.\n\nI suffer from depression. And there are times I can't even handle phone calls.\n\nAnd if I make plans and can't I tell them to go without me. \n\nYou are a great friend group. I have never had friends agree to stay in with me.\n\nBut you are allowed to go do things.\n\nSet a night each week you will try to get together and do boardgames. Rest of the time you can hang out alone or in pairs or be a trio.

Invite her and tell her nicely that you are going day of and tell her if she decides to stay in that\u2019s on her.", "Totally agree with this.\n\nAs some one with anxiety especially in social situations who has been in therapy for it, the treatment is..... leaving the house and going to social situations and crowded places! You ramp it up under the care of the therapist. Staying in all the time is actually doing Laura more harm than good because her anxiety is controlling her, and by extension her friends, life. It literally will not get better without any change in her current lifestyle. And that's not fair to her friends to miss to accommodate her refusal to take action. Her mental health is not her fault, but it is her responsibility.\n\nYour suggestion of options is a good one. Then Laura can choose, but her friends still get to do what they want. It might even force the issue of leaving the house because she clearly does get fomo.", "Exactly my thoughts!", ">consider not posting excessively to social media, to spare her feelings.\n\nI agreed with you up to this point.  Again OP is being asked to not do something she wants to do or may like to do in order to not hurt her friend's feeling.  This reminds me of how parents expects their abled bodied child/ren to put aside their wants and needs in order to accommodate the sensibilities of their disabled sibling.", "I mean, that's a pretty valid reason to not invite someone, especially when you take account that she's guilt - tripp-y.", "Seriously, it's ridiculous that you should shield an adult from the reality that you hang out with other people. She's grown she can take it", "NTA. I also struggle with depression and anxiety. I hate big crowds and I am definitely a big homebody. But I don't hold anyone else back from doing their thing. If I'm asked to do something, I'll tell them that I'll get back to them closer to the date. I will definitely admit I've made plans when I'm in a good mood and then don't want to go the day of. But that's my problem and I just say Hey I'll catch you guys later. \n\nIt's on your friend to manage her own mental health and her own symptoms. If the only thing she wants to do is have nights in, that's fine but she needs to accept that other people will do other things without her. I'd sit down and ask how she wants outings to be handled. You shouldn't put your life on hold because of your friend.", "NTA. I have a friend, we used to be close. Now we only talk on the phone about once a month to catch up (she's all about drama, so it's mostly her talking about the latest). I stopped inviting her to my girls night game night a year ago as every time I've invited her she calls me the day of to tell me she isn't coming because isn't feeling good.", "NTA. Your friend's condition will obviously impact her but beyond giving her your support and understanding it shouldn't impact yours. I agree, if she can't manage to join you in your plans she should accept that the plans can go ahead without her.", "NTA, and unfortunately, Laura will not be your bf much longer.  People grow and you are at the age where your growth expands rapidly.  Due to her illness, her growth will be much less.  Not her fault, not your fault.  Let her know that you MUST get out more for YOUR health.  You can try to accommodate Laura as much as possible, but expect her to not only be unable to participate, but become even more antisocial, which is unfortunately a common result of those experiencing depression and anxiety.  While I know you are saddened by this, you have to continue your personal growth.  I am making an assumption that Laura has been properly diagnosed, if not she needs professional help.  My mom went through something similar with her cousin/bf years back.  Mom's life was literally spiraling out of control like her cousins because she was the only outlet for cousin.  You can support Laura and love her, but more than likely you cannot cure her.", "NTA, with a \"however\".\n\nLaura is having a hard time. I do think you should keep inviting her - I've been in her position, and it sucks to feel excluded - but if she flakes or cancels, don't adjust your plans for her. For example:\n\nHer: \"Hey I don't feel like going to the Christmas market, it's too much for me. Can we hang out at home instead?\"\nYou: \"Aw I'm sorry to hear it! I am / we are still gonna go, but it's okay if you can't come; let's hang out soon instead.\"\n\nThis situation is on both her and you - her for laying on the guilt trip, and you for letting her. Set some boundaries and don't keep changing your plans to suit her.", "NTA.\n\ni\u2019m severely depressed and i\u2019d rather my friends have fun without me than dragging them along in my misery at home", "NTA- I share Laura\u2019s anxieties about large crowds but I would never make my friends miss out on something bc I didn\u2019t want to go. Your feelings are justified", "NTA I have these same conditions plus some others, my husband adds autism to the mix we regularly don't feel like going on planned outings we still go 90% of the time bc we think it rude to make plans then change them last minute (extenuating circumstances not withstanding ) my hubby loathes crowds, but still goes (I act as a bulldozer for him since they don't bother me as much) \n\nI can understand the emotions/ feelings behind your friends' actions, but sometimes we have to understand our personal stuff can't be forced onto others", "NTA, but there's a compromise between \"don't ever invite her\" and \"invite her, then bail on your plans when she doesn't want to go.\" Invite her and tell her that you understand she may not be up for the event on the day, but your plans aren't changing. Don't choose activities to invite her to that require tickets or reservations. If she tells you the day of the activity that she can't go, say you're sorry to hear that and you'll see her another time, and go anyway. She can't guilt trip you into staying if you refuse to play that game.", "YTA. You can stay connected without doing everything together - but talk it out because its not okay to make those decisions for her.", "> ask Laura which of those two approaches she would prefer you to take.\n\n**This.** Plain, clear, honest communication. She can\u2019t hold it against you if she chose which she would prefer. \n\nAnd she can\u2019t propose the option she actually wants (\u201c*no I would prefer you all sacrifice everything in your social life because of my mental health*\u201d) because it\u2019s ridiculous. \n\nAnd if she tries to make out like you being honest with her and asking what she would prefer is you \u201cattacking\u201d her (which she might), then you can interpret that as a sign that you need to take a step back from her right now. She\u2019s not capable of thinking reasonably or prioritizing anyone else\u2019s best interest with empathy because she\u2019s too preoccupied with her own mental health. \n\nI have had to completely step back from friends in this situation. When (if) they are later ready to have a meaningful relationship again, you can be open and let them know you absolutely won\u2019t hold anything against them. But if they start to guilt trip you in a manipulative way again, take a step back again. She\u2019s not ready yet.", "Agree with this also. \n\nYou can continue inviting her to events and sharing what the plans are. If she doesn\u2019t feel up to it that day she can opt out with no hard feelings.

Don\u2019t become like her.", "NTA.\n\nI have a friend exactly like this - we can plan events months ahead of time and have everything laid out so there's no guessing or stress involved for him, but the day of his attitude towards everything changes and it's frustrating. At the end of the day you can't force them to act a certain way and there's nothing wrong with being up front about being frustrated with plans always changing at their whim.\n\nMental illness is a factor but never an excuse - at a certain point people need to understand that others will not always accommodate their needs. If your friend is unwilling to step outside her box, you're not obligated to stay in that box with her.", "NTA \nMy sister has a friend like this. They invite her to everything but make it clear these are the plans and she is welcome to join if she feels up to it. She will also make time to catch up with her friend in the ways that she feels comfortable. You don\u2019t put your life on hold for someone else.", "NTA.  you should establish boundaries.  make an schedule or something like that.  for example:  two days a week you will spend in her living room making her company and doing nothing, and the other days you are allowed to make your own plans and live your own life without being guilt tripped.", "NTA\n\nNot everything needs to be a group activity\n\nAnd you don't need to cancel plans just bc she doesn't feel up to going when it's an ongoing occurrence\n\nFind a middle ground. Plan nights in with her but plan and stick to regular nights out", "NTA. You sound like you are doing your best.  It is draining being friends with someone with mental health conditions, and I think they often fail to see the huge impact it has on everyone else. It is easy for her to focus on the one time you went without her rather than the many times you accommodated her. I would just explain to her it was just because she didn't want to come last time and you didn't want her to feel bad. Not because you wanted to go without her,  which is maybe what she is insecure about. Maybe in the future, agree that you will let her know you are going, and if she wants to come, she can, and if not,  you will go without her, but ask her to understand that while you want to support her,  you do need to sometimes do things she can't.", "NTA\nIs she seeing someone about her crippling anxiety?  Is she on meds? \nThere is help if she seeks it..she also seems minipulative", "Make your plans. Invite her to your plans. Don\u2019t change them. Mix in game nights with that also.", "You do not belong to one friend, mentally well or otherwise. Just because there are many things she doesn't want to do doesn't mean you also cannot do them. Keep up the game nights but you also need to go out and have fun, unrestricted by your friend's issues. Do so without guilt. Otherwise you will look back with bitter resentment, NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't required to change everything for her mental health, you still need to live your life.\n\nIf you are worried about excluding her, maybe you could try inviting her, but phrasing it differently, eg. We are going to do X activity on this day, we would love you to join us if you feel up to it. If you don't, we completely understand and we will organise a game night in on another day so we can all hang out. \n\nBall is then in her court, if she says yes and then decides she can't, you need to stick to your guns and tell her that you will arrange something she is more comfortable with on another day.", "NTA.\n\nLaura shouldn't be calling all of the shots regarding your outings.\n\nThat and you two (you and Laura) aren't attached at the hip.", "NTA, but you need to learn to say, Sorry you can\u2019t make it, we\u2019ll miss you.  Maybe next time?", "Sometimes it's ok to not want to haggle on plans. So if you know inviting someone will involve a haggle because that's how it is with them, it's ok to not invite them. People don't need to be invited to everything. I'm not saying ghost, but they don't need an invite to every set of plans.", "So the approach here is invite your friend so she feels wanted and not excluded but do not change plans when she opts out. \n\nShe may still be a bit sad that she\u2019s missing out but that is her own fault and she can\u2019t claim you\u2019re excluding her because you did invite her. \n\nStill include the occasional staying in night so she\u2019s not completely out of the loop but there is no need to restrict yourself.", "NTA---I have been that friend, and honestly, it still can be. The depression and anxiety are a bitch to deal with. But I would never expect people to shift their plans just to accommodate me, and I sure as heck wouldn't get upset if they went out without me. If I'm feeling too anxious to go, I'm relieved my friends still go have fun, and I don't feel pressured.  \n\nOf course, mental illness affects everyone differently; but it does not give one a free pass to call the shots and make other's lives revolve around it. It sounds like you both have been really great and supportive friends to her! That's awesome, and please don't feel like the AH.", "NTA and, as someone who has battled depression & anxiety for years, I applaud your actions. You weren\u2019t rejecting Laura, you (and your other friend) were taking care of your own needs and having a little fun. I like Sunflower_dream85\u2019s take on it; very honest and upfront, and it makes it very clear that Laura has a choice in the matter.", "NTA. The problem here is that when you invite her and she doesn't want to go, you do what she wants. Stop doing this. Keep your plans up, enjoy time with your other friend. Post online. Make new friends. \n\nShe is basically calling the shots of your friendship. She needs to understand she will either go or stay home.", "NTA", "NTA - I've had two friends who I've excused bad behavior from because of their mental health issues. I loved them too at the time. But suddenly when I gently brought up how those issues were affecting me and our other friends they went batshit.\n\nI would suggest gently speaking with her about the issue and then seeing how she reacts. Guilt tripping is manipulation. Set some boundaries and stick to them.", "NTA. This won\u2018t solve any underlying issues, but my practical advice - coming from someone who\u2018s had similar issues with a friend - is to not meet up at someone\u2018s place, but at the place of the activity or at least not directly at home. If you say \u201ewe\u2018ll meet at the railway station at 4 pm and then take the train to the city christmas market\u201c or \u201elet\u2018s meet at the amusement park at x time\u201c it\u2018s on her to either show up or not, but if you\u2018re not home she can\u2018t talk you into staying in. If she changes her mind last minute the rest of you will already be there and can enjoy your activity\u2026", "NTA she need to go to therapy, get on medications, and she ruins your plans every time and then gets mad if you go. She\u2019s entitled, not a good friend. I have panic disorder and have 9 hour panic attacks and I still go out. by giving into her anxiety and depression your enabling her to behave like a child.", "Nta, she needs to get help for her anxieties, trust me I struggle with getting out of bed daily but therapy has helped immensely. You need to live your life and just because you do things without her doesn't mean you don't care. She needs help and you have to live your life.", "NTA. You can\u2019t sacrifice your life for her. She needs to get some help, but you can\u2019t live your life working around her needs. She\u2019s a friend, not your child.", "NTA", "As I do with a similar friend, Present the plan, invite her, but no option for HER to change the plans...and never when she's at your home. It's too late then for her to voice her change of heart.", "NTA\n\nInvite her. When she ultimately says she can't, respond with, 'okay, we'll miss you, have a good day!' The plan was to attend a Christmas market. You're either in or out. If complains and says she wants to play games, plan a games night later on another day. Today is Christmas market day! Don't feel bad. It's okay to be firm and it's okay to do what you want to do without feeling guilty. Your friends feeling are HER responsibility and not yours.", "NAH\n\nI\u2019m not considering any of you assholes because I\u2019m not sure on how the scenarios work out. \n\nDoes she pressure you all into cancelling and staying in, or is it just a quiet decision made by everyone really?  If she pressures everyone into staying in, then she\u2019s an asshole. \n\nExpecting her to say \u201cjust go without me\u201d isn\u2019t realistic. If she\u2019s struggling with anxiety she\u2019s also struggling with feeling left out - she wants to be with you all. \n\nYou\u2019re also quite capable of going anyway. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re not feeling up to coming out! We\u2019ll make plans another day\u201d is a boundary you are allowed to set. \n\nContinue including her in plans and invites. Just stop cancelling the plans to stay in when she isn\u2019t up to going out. When it\u2019s a group plan that isn\u2019t just 1:1 then you can easily still go and do X with one less person. \n\nBasically, when it comes to plans and visits there are two priorities. A plan can prioritize a Thing/Place. Or a plan can prioritize People. \n\nWhen you make a plan that is prioritizing a Thing, then stick to the plan and if she doesn\u2019t join then that\u2019s ok. If the priority is People then stay together even if it means you stay in for games. \n\nIt sounds like you primarily prioritize the Thing and you\u2019re resentful to be missing out in the Things. She prioritizes the People. It\u2019s a conflict, but you can work together if you value the friendship. \n\nWhen you\u2019re mostly just making plans to hang out together: \u201cHey, let\u2019s all get together on Friday. Maybe we could catch a movie or just order in - we can decide on Friday!\u201d makes it clear you\u2019re prioritizing being together that day regardless of what you\u2019re doing. \u201cI want to go to X on Saturday. I\u2019m thinking 3pm if that works for everyone - but if it doesn\u2019t I\u2019m going anyway!\u201d makes it clear that the priority is the Thing. \n\nIf you as a group start being more clear in your plans together you can help minimize the conflict and hurt feelings you\u2019re both having.", "NTA it's ok to not set your activities on the back burner for chronic depression.  You can still be with your friend but in boundaries or it will start eating away at your friendship.", "YTA.   \nBe like Pooh and friends to Eeyore. They always invite him along and never exclude him from anything. They never treat him any differently than any of the others. \nAsk her to go. If she declines, that's on her. But at least then, you've shown effort.", "NTA, I think you need to make it clear to Laura that a) you WANT to spend time with her, you WANT her to feel better and to be able to do these things and b) you will NOT be cancelling plans for her anymore. Let her spend time at home alone if she has a bad day when you have plans, and make plans specifically TO have game nights other times. If you think she'll be able to abide by that (instead of trying to guilt you) then that might be a better option. But if she's not going to be able to go, and determined to make it so that means YOU don't get to go either, then you've done what you can, and SHE is the one creating the problem. Part of managing mental illness is accepting when it makes you miss out on things and handling resentment/loneliness from that instead of making it constantly everyone else's problem.", "Nta. You have every right to meet up with your other friend 1on1 and that's it. You can also invite her, tell her that you want to include her and if she says 'no' than it's on her. You dont need to change plans every time just for her and you can have night at home every other week. Simple solution", "I have similar issues and sometimes have to miss scheduled plans with friends because of my anxiety. I would be hurt if this was done to me but not because of my friends but because I would feel bad about letting my anxiety control me. You have been a great friend and you deserve to me able to go out and live your life and not feel like you are wasting your 20s.Laura needs to realize that this is her issue and she needs to work on it\n\nNTA", "NTA TFFFFF", "Great point. Posting the photo was not a mistake.", "Agree! Both of you should have a clear conversation with her and put down boundaries, if you all make plans and she cancels, that\u2019s ok, but if she tries to keep everyone at the house, that is crossing a boundary. If she chooses not to go, that\u2019s fine but she can\u2019t be upset when you go and post pictures online. \n\n(NTA)", "I don\u2019t think YTA, in fact you\u2019re NTA at all because you\u2019re considering her feelings and adjusting to her comfort. My husband has terrible anxiety and hates to go out at all. He will suck it up sometimes, but he struggles. However, he hates to feel left out. Being given the choice and being offered an invitation means a lot. Keep trying to include her, knowing she will most likely turn you down, but also make plans that will definitely include her. Maybe say something like \u201cHey, we are heading to the Market on Thursday, would you like to join us?\u201d  That way you can go without and not feel guilty when she turns you down. Then next time ask her if she\u2019d like to come over for a game night. She\u2019s still included, but no one is obligated.", "I have a friend that has blown me off for plans at the last minute\u2014or three hours after the last minute\u2014more times than I can count. The same friend also has depression , anxiety and agoraphobia as a result of cptsd. Neither of you is an AH. But you need to talk. It\u2019s ok to not want to miss out on doing things because of where she is, but excluding her outright could devastate her. Try talking, letting her know your feelings, and try to understand where she\u2019s coming from. Then work on compromises. Still invite her, give her time to try and prepare herself, but also let her know that if she can\u2019t make it, you\u2019re still going to go, and you can hang out with her another time. Give her the option to come along if she wants, but be clear that even if she can\u2019t make it, you and your other friend will still go. Maybe you can bring her back a keychain or something to let her know you were thinking of her. \n\nBut the most important part is talking and conversing. You need to communicate.", "NTA- - Laura isn't your responsibility nor are you obligated to invite her to every hangout. You don't have to invite her everywhere especially if you know she won't go", "I\u2019m gonna vote YTA because you\u2019re blaming this on her anxiety/depression when you\u2019re the one choosing not to go through with these plans. No one\u2019s holding a gun to your head telling you you can\u2019t go to the damn Christmas market because your friend has anxiety. Just extend the invite, if she cancels she cancels, go anyway. Why is this a question.", "as someone with severe anxiety and depression (as well as asd and adhd), I agree. \n\nI accept(ed) invites because at the moment I really really wanted to do the thing. However with chronic pain and other things, I couldn't guarantee I would be there. Add in autistic kids and a partner and well, it was rare that we made it out of the house.   I never tried to change the event, I just didn't go and profusely apologised.", "Imagine me doing that orange is the new black pensatucky hands in the air gif right now. I'm bipolar and you know what I do when I'm depressed, I tell my husband, daughter, friends and family to go do whatever they have planned. I don't expect them to stay in when I'm physically sick, I don't expect them to stay on when I'm mentally sick.", "Since it's the holidays, I'd add one other option if she's unable/unwilling to go out to something like a Christmas Market: ask her if there's something that she'd like you to purchase for her, and phone her to show her what you selected. It might make her feel like part of the planned activity.\\*\n\nAs someone with depression and anxiety, there are times when I just can't face the world. These are my issues, and I don't expect the world or my friends to stop living their lives for me.\n\n(\\*Note: I'd only say to do this as part of an event, like a major holiday or someone's birthday; not as a routine obligation/offer on your part.)", "Honestly OP and friends should put some preassure on her to get her to go with them anyway. Its the best cure for anxiety."]}
