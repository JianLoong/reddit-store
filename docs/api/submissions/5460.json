{"id": 5460, "submission_id": "zti9be", "title": "AITA for not inviting my mentally ill friend to activities anymore?", "selftext": "I (21f) have a best friend (Laura, 22f) who has really bad depression and anxiety.\n\nWe have a friend group of 3 people, and almost every single time we plan to do something (going out at night, going to an amusenent park etc. and most recently going to a christmas market) she is as enthusiastic about doing it as everyone else, but when that day comes, she doesn\u2018t feel mentally well enough to go anymore. \n\nThis time we even tried to compromise by not going to a christmas market in the capital city like we initially wanted to, but offering to go to a smaller, local one bc she said that she can\u2018t handle big crowds. At first she seemed to consider it, but eventually decided that it would still be too much and pretty much guilt tripped my other friend and me into staying in. We played board games and watched movies. Like we always do. We literally haven\u2018t done anything else for months. Don\u2018t get me wrong - I love our game nights, I love her and I would never expect her to do something that gives her anxiety, but I feel like I\u2018m wasting my 20s sittting in my living room because all of our plans never become reality bc of her. Am I wrong in thinking that the polite thing to do would have been her telling us to go without her? Especially because we had been planning on going to the christmas market for weeks, finally found a date that worked for everyone and I could tell the moment she came to my place that she didn\u2018t want to go. \n\nYesterday I realized that I needed to do some last minute christmas shopping and finally wanted to go to a christmas market after going to the mall. Knowing that there would be huge crowds, I only asked my other friend (Mary, 23f) to come with me and made the mistake of posting a picture in my instagram stories later on. Laura texted me today, upset that we excluded her. On one hand I feel like an awful friend, bc it's not her fault that her mental health is so bad, but on the other hand I feel like if I keep asking her to come with us, we'll never make it out of my living room.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your comments, they have been very helpful! I wanted to clear some things up: Laura is in therapy and on medications and has been since middle school. My issue also isn\u2018t that she cancels plans last minute - of course that\u2018s upsetting but I could definetely understand that. My issue is that she doesn\u2019t cancel when she doesn\u2019t want to go anymore. She agrees to go, shows up at my place at the agreed upon time (we usually meet at my place bc I\u2019m the only one with a car) and when we\u2018re literally standing in my doorframe ready to go - that\u2018s when she\u2018ll back out. And to her it seems obvious that the two of us will stay in with her once she has decided that she\u2018s unable to go. It\u2018s like the activity depends on all of us going because we\u2019re only 3 people. On the rare occasion that we have something planned with more friends, she\u2019ll usually push herself to go or cancel, but since we\u2019re her closest two friends, she almost expects us to put her mental health first as good friends. She\u2019s genuinely a sweet person and not manipulative at all, I just think she\u2019s insecure and wants to spend time with us, so she doesn\u2018t want to be left out.", "created_utc": 1671807583, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zti9be/aita_for_not_inviting_my_mentally_ill_friend_to/", "score": 688, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You do what you want to do with your life.  If you stop posting stuff because you are worried about what a friend \"might\" do, then you are living in co-dependency.  You aren't responsible for her happiness, and you shouldn't wait for your happiness until she has hers.\n\nYou have not been unreasonable.  If you want BBQ and a friend is a vegetarian, you don't expect them to come.  If you want to go parachuting but your friend fears heights of course you don't invite her.  She is taking offense when there is none being offered.  And that is probably part of the illness.  So you can have compassion for her, but you don't owe her staying home.\n\nJust because someone is upset doesn't mean you did anything wrong.  Part of having healthy boundaries means others might be upset when you do what you want.", "NTA  You didn't exclude her. You have learned from past experiences that your friend doesn't enjoy crowds. If she wants to stay home that's perfectly fine. But it's not okay to ask all of you to stay home.", "NTA at all. If someone continually cancels, backs out at the last minute, makes the entire group cater to them, or forces last minute changes eventually they will not be invited to future events. \n\nIt is extremely unfortunate that her mental health is preventing her from doing fun activities with y\u2019all but it also seems after reading this that this all could also be affecting your happiness and mental health. Plan periodic game nights to spend time with her comfortably and specific outings that she can choose to attend or not. But continue with your plans whether she comes out or not, it\u2019s not fair for you to sacrifice your social life for someone else.", "NTA. Your friend seems a bit self-centered. Just explain to her the reality: every time y\u2019all try to go out publicly, she\u2019s uncomfortable. No one can expect to be continually invited to something when their answer has always previously been no. I have a feeling that later in life you will find out this friend is not really a friend.

Maybe reserve a certain day or days a month for low-key nights in together.", "NTA for wanting to go out and do things. You don\u2019t always need to take everyone in a big group. \n\nBut it sounds like you need to have a straightforward conversation with Laura and (with kindness and compassion) tell her how you feel.

It\u2018a okay to grow apart, and also to have different lifestyles as friends. Communicate this, based on your post I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be empathetic.

Which is important when someone has a mental illness, but you have to look out for yourself and not have to fear reactions or walk on eggshells around another. You\u2019re not an AH but try to resolve it, if she wants to keep being invited but not show up that\u2019s also fine - but if it seems like she\u2019s bending your plans and social desires to her wishes, it is very unfair to you.", "NTA", "stand up for yourself-you can hang out w whoever, whenever!

I tend to be that friend who happily agrees to plans, and then as the day draws near, my anxiety often gets the best of me and I end up cancelling. I hate it, but I can't help it. With that said (and this is in my case alone, not necessarily your friend) if I push myself to go, I often have fun. \n\nHOWEVER. It is unrealistic and selfish of her to get upset if you do things without her. That's not fair. \n\nNTA. She is using her mental health issues to manipulate you into staying within her comfort zone with no regards to your feelings, and that's not okay. She can't expect everything to be her way only.", "NAH yet.  \n\nYou need to sit down with your friend and have a serious conversation to lay out expectations moving forward.

And I\u2019m not going to resent them because they are having fun and I\u2019m sitting at home with a book.

She also needs to understand and accept that if you have delayed doing something that you want to do (especially something with a limited time frame) to accommodate her, you will continue with those plans even if she has to cancel. \n\nIt\u2019s not wrong to continue to live your life while simultaneously respecting her limitations.

She's not trying to punish you for not hanging out with her? You don't need to invite your entire friend group every single time you need to do an individual activity.

It literally will not get better without any change in her current lifestyle. And that's not fair to her friends to miss to accommodate her refusal to take action. Her mental health is not her fault, but it is her responsibility.\n\nYour suggestion of options is a good one. Then Laura can choose, but her friends still get to do what they want.

People grow and you are at the age where your growth expands rapidly.  Due to her illness, her growth will be much less.  Not her fault, not your fault.  Let her know that you MUST get out more for YOUR health.  You can try to accommodate Laura as much as possible, but expect her to not only be unable to participate, but become even more antisocial, which is unfortunately a common result of those experiencing depression and anxiety.  While I know you are saddened by this, you have to continue your personal growth.  I am making an assumption that Laura has been properly diagnosed, if not she needs professional help.

Don't choose activities to invite her to that require tickets or reservations.

If you don't, we completely understand and we will organise a game night in on another day so we can all hang out. \n\nBall is then in her court, if she says yes and then decides she can't, you need to stick to your guns and tell her that you will arrange something she is more comfortable with on another day.", "NTA.\n\nLaura shouldn't be calling all of the shots regarding your outings.\n\nThat and you two (you and Laura) aren't attached at the hip.", "NTA, but you need to learn to say, Sorry you can\u2019t make it, we\u2019ll miss you.

For example, \"When I see something I'd like to do, I'll put it out there for you to join, but if you're not feeling up for it I will go ahead and do it either by myself, or with whoever else is available. It's really important to me that we do the activity that we've planned, as I get excited for it and then disappointed when the plans change last minute.

So are happy to plan stay in days with her, but will also be doing other stuff. I'd continue to invite her along the lines of \"no pressure. But we're doing X, lmk if you can make it!\" Then just to some degree prepare to go even without her, and stick to it. \n\nIt can be a lot, but it's worth considering for someone you care about.

With social anxiety and severe depression while growing up I've said no to many events but never once asked plans to be changed because of me.

He's also trying to guilt trip me to do the same while not realizing I'm not doing so well either. Mostly it's because he's driven himself into this situation to be her around the clock entertainer and needs a break once in a while but still doesn't see that he needs to let her live her life. I feel guilty but refuse/find it impossible to play his game and find it ruining my relationship with my sister. I see her pretty much every weekend or whenever I find myself having enough energy to join her plans. I'm not willing to sacrifice my own well-being by giving into what I don't have energy for. I know she struggles and I feel like an awful person since my brother is more like my dad and often makes plans with her. My mom doesn't think our dad's behavior will do my sister any favors in the long run. \n\nI guess compromise would be best, doing the things that you have planned, she comes along or doesn't, and then have seperate days spend inside. This must be quite draining for you no matter how much you love your friend, and will probably hurt your relationship in the long run if she can't compromise/see that you guys keep missing out.

If she continuously tries to control and disrespect those boundries, It's better to distance yourself a bit. \n\nYou are not the resolution to her problems.

And though she's on medication and in therapy, she can also do lifestyle changes other than just leaving the house that can improve things for her. Eating a healthy balanced and relatively unprocessed diet with 15 minute of physical activity a day can help balance her gut health which significantly impacts mental illness. Hopefully she'll push herself more eventually cause the avoidance is proven to make the anxiety worse.", "NTA\n\nBut let me correct a bit of your last part. \n\nShe *is* being manipulative. \n\nShe knows that all she has to do is play her depression/anxiety card and you and your other friend will jump through hoops to make her happy and do only what she wants to do. She has turned her support system into her enabling system. I say this as someone with anxiety, depression, and PTSD. \n\nShe's not faking the depression/anxiety. She's faking the enthusiasm, so you'll believe that her \"new\" bout of depression/anxiety is sudden and unexpected. The reality is that it's constant because she's not being challenged enough to work through it. I'd bet dollars to doughnuts that she's running the same game on her therapist: taking the meds but showing no real progress. She's not doing her therapy homework. \n\nHere's where she is:\n\nShe wants to stay home but she doesn't want to be alone. \n\nShe doesn't want to be around people, but she wants people around her.\n\nIn each case, she fakes enthusiasm all the way up to the point when you and your other friend have no choice but to coddle her and only do what she wants to do.\n\nDon't stop inviting her. Not just yet.\n\nPlan another outing. As you're leaving, make sure she's the one in front 'cause y'all might have to push her ass out your door.\n\nWhen she tries to back out at the last minute, tell her that it's okay, you understand. Continue out the door and lock it. Tell her that you're going to take her home, and then, you and your other friend are going out. \n\nShe will protest and want to go back inside. The answer is a firm, \"Momma-Said-No\" kind of no. Not mean, just firm. She goes on the outing or you take her home. Period.\n\nIf she has a meltdown/panic attack, call an ambulance and let them take her to the hospital. Once she's on her way, go have fun. She'll be mad, but she'll be fine.\n\nWhy an ambulance? Because panic attacks can mimic heart attacks, and you love her so much that you don't want to take a chance of making a mistake. If she refuses to go with the paramedics, call her an Uber and send her ass home. You don't want to be responsible for somebody who goes AMA.\n\nThen, you and your other friend go have fun. \n\nIf she doesn't have a meltdown, she will protest. Tell her that you don't want to force her to go anywhere she's not feeling up to going, so you're going to drop her off at home, where she'll feel better. \n\nShe'll protest that, too. \n\nGive her a choice: You can take her home or you can keep with your plans, but you're not going back inside your house. And if she decides to keep with your plans, there's to be no complaining. Tell her that at the first sign of a panic attack, you're going to drop her off at the nearest ER, charge her for the gas - and you and your other friend will return to the activity without her.\n\nIf she digs in her heels, leave her ass standing there and go have fun. \n\nSee, here's the thing:\n\nAt this stage of the game, she knows what she can handle on outings and when she can handle it. She knows your plans and activities. She's not being proactive with her depression/anxiety, because no-one is holding her accountable. \n\nNow, her currency is time with her friends. Use that as a way to motivate her into spending equal time doing what you and your other friend want to do - just like you two do with her.\n\nAnother tactic is to plan game nights with her - and only do game nights in the nights you plan with her. So, say, one Friday is game night and the next Friday is market night or whatever, and alternate. She can  choose to do only game nights, but you and your other friend do not change your plans for her to have an extra game night. If she tries her at-the-door shenanigans, tell her that she has two minutes to get it together, or you'll call an ambulance. Then, give her the choice: home or market. Game night on your all's night is not an option, and no, you're not switching.\n\nThis will be difficult, because she's your friend. But if you want to break the cycle, you have to change the rules. She's not going to, because she has no incentive to. Hanging out with you two is her currency. Incentivize it and make it worth her growth.\n\nPS it'll only take one or two ER visits to let her know you're serious.", "Nta have a frank discussion, if she backs out thats fine but plans will still stand. Or if she doesnt like that, plans will be made with out her."]}
