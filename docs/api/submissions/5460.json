At first she seemed to consider it, but eventually decided that it would still be too much and pretty much guilt tripped my other friend and me into staying in. We played board games and watched movies. Like we always do. We literally haven\u2018t done anything else for months. Don\u2018t get me wrong - I love our game nights, I love her and I would never expect her to do something that gives her anxiety, but I feel like I\u2018m wasting my 20s sittting in my living room because all of our plans never become reality bc of her. Am I wrong in thinking that the polite thing to do would have been her telling us to go without her? Especially because we had been planning on going to the christmas market for weeks, finally found a date that worked for everyone and I could tell the moment she came to my place that she didn\u2018t want to go. \n\nYesterday I realized that I needed to do some last minute christmas shopping and finally wanted to go to a christmas market after going to the mall. Knowing that there would be huge crowds, I only asked my other friend (Mary, 23f) to come with me and made the mistake of posting a picture in my instagram stories later on. Laura texted me today, upset that we excluded her. On one hand I feel like an awful friend, bc it's not her fault that her mental health is so bad, but on the other hand I feel like if I keep asking her to come with us, we'll never make it out of my living room.", "created_utc": 1671807583, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zti9be/aita_for_not_inviting_my_mentally_ill_friend_to/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she can't do things because of her mental health, there are two options to protect your self from the effects of her disorder.\n\nYou could invite her to things, and not change the plans if/when she isn't feeling up to the planned actvities. \"I'm sorry you're not feeling up for it, but we're still going to the Christmas market. Perhaps we can do something later.\"\n\nor you could not invite her to things that you think she won't be up for.\n\nAnd you could ask Laura which of those two approaches she would prefer you to take.\n\nIf Laura's disorder is putting her inside, playing board games for months, thats no reason that you should let it force you inside, playing board games.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is easy: Invite her, but if she can not come, do't change the plans.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: Tehre is NOTHING wrong in going shopping with only one friend.", "NTA. \n\nI get that it's hard for Laura, because her mental health shifts how she can do things, and it sounds like she hasn't fully accepted that yet. I believe she has every intention to go with you when she commits.\n\nI'd continue to invite her, maybe saying that you understand if that day things change for her but you're still going to go, and then have games nights at whatever frequency works for you so she still has the social time. \n\nIt sounds like you care about her a lot, so having scheduled games nights and inviting her to other things but going without her if she cancels is the best middle ground", "NTA and you didn't make a mistake posting that photo.  You do what you want to do with your life.  If you stop posting stuff because you are worried about what a friend \"might\" do, then you are living in co-dependency.  You aren't responsible for her happiness, and you shouldn't wait for your happiness until she has hers.\n\nYou have not been unreasonable.  If you want BBQ and a friend is a vegetarian, you don't expect them to come.  If you want to go parachuting but your friend fears heights of course you don't invite her.  She is taking offense when there is none being offered.  And that is probably part of the illness.  So you can have compassion for her, but you don't owe her staying home.\n\nJust because someone is upset doesn't mean you did anything wrong.  Part of having healthy boundaries means others might be upset when you do what you want.", "NTA  You didn't exclude her. You have learned from past experiences that your friend doesn't enjoy crowds. If she wants to stay home that's perfectly fine. But it's not okay to ask all of you to stay home.", "NTA at all. If someone continually cancels, backs out at the last minute, makes the entire group cater to them, or forces last minute changes eventually they will not be invited to future events. \n\nIt is extremely unfortunate that her mental health is preventing her from doing fun activities with y\u2019all but it also seems after reading this that this all could also be affecting your happiness and mental health. Plan periodic game nights to spend time with her comfortably and specific outings that she can choose to attend or not. But continue with your plans whether she comes out or not, it\u2019s not fair for you to sacrifice your social life for someone else.", "NTA. Your friend seems a bit self-centered. Just explain to her the reality: every time y\u2019all try to go out publicly, she\u2019s uncomfortable. No one can expect to be continually invited to something when their answer has always previously been no. I have a feeling that later in life you will find out this friend is not really a friend. People who take and never give, the nonreciprocators, are just a drain and end up needing to be dumped.", "NTA. But definitely communicate that to her.", "You gotta be open and honest about this but NTA. It's not her fault her mental health is bad but it's also not fair to you and your friend to constantly be cancelling plans. God forbid yall plan something that costs money to go to and Laura dips out on that.", "From the perspective of someone with both anxiety and a mood disorder - NTA. \n\nIt's not your fault and you're not obligated to deal with it.", "NTA.\n\nYou have your own needs and priorities. If she cannot manage her anxiety, it's not allowed to dictate your schedule", "NTA at all. You can't live your life if you're constantly babysitting her. \n\nShe's also never going to want to leave her living room comfort zone because you are enabling her to stay home. You never push back, so why should she?\n\nNext time, make plans to go wherever you want as usual, but if she doesn't want to go, just say \"ok, the two of us are still going and hopefully you want to join us next time because we really want you to come with us.\"", "NTA OP but CONSTANTLY putting your wants and needs to the side while trying to accommodate her in her mental health struggle is not only affecting your mental health but will foster resentment towards her in the near future.  You just need to calmly tell friend that you and companion(s) understand she don't want to go but you've made these plans for some time and do not want to and will not cancel them.  Then go ahead with your plans and feel no guilt.  You can't constantly stop living your life for someone else.", "NTA, but stop referring to her as your \"mentally ill friend\".", "NTA", "NTA\nYou're not her therapist and while it is great that you take her needs into consideration and change plans accordingly, you should also lead your own life. You have no anxiety and depression and your don't need to live your life as someone who does.\n\nI would not go behind her back. Invite her and if she doesn't want to join, too bad. Try again next time. She cannot blame you for doing stuff she doesn't want to do - but she can blame you for being excluded.\n\nMy suggestion would be to make space for activities that she enjoys and can do fear-free, while also leaving space for activities that you also want to do, that she might have an issue with.", "NTA - sometimes people who are depressed/have anxiety want to be invited so that they feel included even if they cannot mentally bring themselves to do the activity. That said, it is not fair for her to expect you all to cancel planned activities altogether when that occurs. \n\nMaybe approach it more as an offer for her to participate when things are planned, if she can go great, but if not no hard feelings on either side while the rest of you do the planned activity. \n\nThe flip of this would be to also plan the more simple board game nights that she does participate in. Maybe reserve a certain day or days a month for low-key nights in together.", "NTA for wanting to go out and do things. You don\u2019t always need to take everyone in a big group. \n\nBut it sounds like you need to have a straightforward conversation with Laura and (with kindness and compassion) tell her how you feel. Say that you still want to invite her places, but she should understand that if she doesn\u2019t feel up to it on the day of, the others will still be going because they were looking forward to it.\n\nAnd if that does happen, consider not posting excessively to social media, to spare her feelings. Focus on sharing the memories with the people who were there :)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2018a okay to grow apart, and also to have different lifestyles as friends. Communicate this, based on your post I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be empathetic. She\u2019s being stubborn about her needs and wants. Which is important when someone has a mental illness, but you have to look out for yourself and not have to fear reactions or walk on eggshells around another. You\u2019re not an AH but try to resolve it, if she wants to keep being invited but not show up that\u2019s also fine - but if it seems like she\u2019s bending your plans and social desires to her wishes, it is very unfair to you.", "NTA", "stand up for yourself-you can hang out w whoever, whenever! NTA, don\u2019t be scared into moderating your posts for another person", "NTA. You're allowed to do your shopping where/when/with whom you choose. But I'm wondering if you've had an open and honest conversation with your friend about feeling conflicted by your desire to support her and your own wants and needs. It's OK to let her know in advance that if she always wants to stay in that sometimes you'll do that with her and sometimes you'll be going out.", "NTA. But as someone who has been this friend, please communicate your frustration to her kindly. Maybe you can both agree that you\u2019ll accept the fact that she might cancel on you sometimes because of her mental health but that at the same time, you might want to make more reliable plans with other friends sometimes.", "So.. here's the thing. I tend to be that friend who happily agrees to plans, and then as the day draws near, my anxiety often gets the best of me and I end up cancelling. I hate it, but I can't help it. With that said (and this is in my case alone, not necessarily your friend) if I push myself to go, I often have fun. \n\nHOWEVER. It is unrealistic and selfish of her to get upset if you do things without her. That's not fair. \n\nNTA. She is using her mental health issues to manipulate you into staying within her comfort zone with no regards to your feelings, and that's not okay. She can't expect everything to be her way only.", "NAH yet.  \n\nYou need to sit down with your friend and have a serious conversation to lay out expectations moving forward. Reiterate that you love her and love spending time with her and want to continue to make plans that include her, but that while you respect and understand if she can\u2019t actually do those plans on the day of, you won\u2019t be changing your plans and staying home. \n\nI\u2019m not a bar/club person. Never have been. I\u2019m miserable, I melt down, I just can\u2019t handle the loudness and people. And my friends know that I\u2019m going to say \u201cthank you but have fun without me\u201d.  And I\u2019m not going to resent them because they are having fun and I\u2019m sitting at home with a book. I also know that if I\u2019m having a bad mental health day, I may miss out on something fun, and that\u2019s not my friends fault or their responsibility to cance their plans to take care of me. \n\nIf she knows she\u2019s not up to going out ahead of time, she needs to be upfront about that. She also needs to understand and accept that if you have delayed doing something that you want to do (especially something with a limited time frame) to accommodate her, you will continue with those plans even if she has to cancel. \n\nIt\u2019s not wrong to continue to live your life while simultaneously respecting her limitations. Neither of you is entitled to control the other. And that includes you not being able to force her to go out AND her not being able to force you to stay in.", "NTA, every time she is invited to an activity she completely reroutes it to what she wants. She's not trying to punish you for not hanging out with her? You don't need to invite your entire friend group every single time you need to do an individual activity. It just sounds like she's trying to trick you into believing that you're not allowed to do anything without her so she can avoid doing her personal work to ensure she is invited to more things. \n\nIf all she has to do is put in the mental work into tricking all of you into believing you have to invite her to every single thing, then she doesn't have to put in any of the bigger work in to addressing her issues.", "NTA. A friend and I are going through something similar with one of our friends - all enthusiasm,  then cancels day of. We're at the point of do we even bother inviting them any more, or do so with the knowledge they probably won't come? \n\nI know that mental healthy struggles are real and there are some events I have had to back out of because I just couldn't.  But you need to live your life too. Maybe make plans and tell Laura that this is the plan (shopping/market/whatever) and you'd appreciate her company, but this is the plan. And keep doing the game nights that you know she can do.", "NTA. It was just quick shopping, and she seemed to consistently cancel, so it's not your fault.", "NTA\n\nIt seems like your friend is enjoying being able to control your ability to have fun. If she is, then she's self medicating with that power. Fighting her depression doesn't mean controlling you in-order to get her mind off of her depression.", "NTA.\n\nI suffer from depression. And there are times I can't even handle phone calls.\n\nAnd if I make plans and can't I tell them to go without me. \n\nYou are a great friend group. I have never had friends agree to stay in with me.\n\nBut you are allowed to go do things.\n\nSet a night each week you will try to get together and do boardgames. Rest of the time you can hang out alone or in pairs or be a trio. But the only time that is devoted to staying in is that day.\n\nObviously it will be missed sometimes and maybe you will need to reschedule. But you all deserve to do what you can handle", "YTA if you don\u2019t invite her because of this. HOWEVER you do not and should not change your plans to cater to her. If she doesn\u2019t want to go the day of. That\u2019s on her. Invite her and tell her nicely that you are going day of and tell her if she decides to stay in that\u2019s on her.", "Totally agree with this.\n\nAs some one with anxiety especially in social situations who has been in therapy for it, the treatment is..... leaving the house and going to social situations and crowded places! You ramp it up under the care of the therapist. Staying in all the time is actually doing Laura more harm than good because her anxiety is controlling her, and by extension her friends, life. It literally will not get better without any change in her current lifestyle. And that's not fair to her friends to miss to accommodate her refusal to take action. Her mental health is not her fault, but it is her responsibility.\n\nYour suggestion of options is a good one. Then Laura can choose, but her friends still get to do what they want. It might even force the issue of leaving the house because she clearly does get fomo.", "Exactly my thoughts!", ">consider not posting excessively to social media, to spare her feelings.\n\nI agreed with you up to this point.  Again OP is being asked to not do something she wants to do or may like to do in order to not hurt her friend's feeling.  This reminds me of how parents expects their abled bodied child/ren to put aside their wants and needs in order to accommodate the sensibilities of their disabled sibling.", "I mean, that's a pretty valid reason to not invite someone, especially when you take account that she's guilt - tripp-y.", "Seriously, it's ridiculous that you should shield an adult from the reality that you hang out with other people. She's grown she can take it"]}
