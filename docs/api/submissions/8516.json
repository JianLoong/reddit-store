We danced and had a good time together, we exchanged numbers and we became great friends. We never dated or anything like that, just friends. \n\nWe spend a lot of time together as he lives a few blocks from my house and we are also coworkers (we work in a music store, I started working there before and recommended him).  We like to go to parties and clubs, we often go together with other friends, almost never it's just the two of us. \n\nWell, five or six months ago he started dating one of his classmates \"Mia\" (f20). I'm a very extrovert person so I tried to be her friend when he introduce us but I could already tell she doesn't like me. Still I've tried until I realized it was a lost cause, I still treat her nicely enough, just don't try to be her friend as she clearly doesn't want to. \n\nShe has openly told me she thinks something fishy is happening between Aaron and I, we both assured her that was not the case. She thinks it's \"weird\" that me and her and both similar looking (not even that much, I guess she's saying this and we're both Asians, but our styles are totally different). I think that's the main issue with her as she doesn't seem to dislike any of Aaron's female friends besides me. \n\nAnyway. Yesterday we were at a party in a friend's house. I got there with a friend, but asked Aaron if he can drive me home (he never drinks so it's the safest way). Mia was there too. Around 3AM Aaron asked me if I wanted to leave already (we worked on Friday so we were kinda tired) I said ok, then Mia started making a big drama because she \"didn't know any of this\" and Aaron was \"supposed to leave with her and not his side bitch\" along with some other stuff. I was very annoyed at that point so I told her something like \"leave me the f alone, I would've wanted to fuck Aaron I would have done it ages ago\". She started crying because that \"confirmed her suspicions\" (it didn't, but she was drunk so she might have understood wrong) and she asked someone to call an Uber for her. Aaron and her went outside to talk and apparently had a fight as he went back inside and asked me to wait for a bit until the Uber arrived, he was afraid that she'll leave with some drunk friend. We waited like half and hour and then left the party after Mia took her own drive home. \n\nI didn't wanted to ask Aaron about what happened (and tbh I was too drunk and tired to care) but this morning I woke up feeling very much like an asshole. I know Mia gets very weird when she's drunk and also know that I probably made her feel more insecure.

She shouldn't be burdening you with them. You might have blurted out something that seems rude but it wasn't uncalled for because she was the one who said something uncalled for.   \n\n\nFirst of all she called you a \"side bitch\".

If you were a guy, she wouldn't have cared at all. She only got upset because she thinks something is going on between you two.   \n\n\nJealousy often comes from the fear that you're not enough and your partner will leave you. She has to deal with that herself otherwise she's going to find someone else to be jealous over if it isn't you.   \n\n\nMaybe Aaron has had a thing for you, maybe his girlfriend picked up on this, but so what?

I don't take stock in whatever drunk people say to each other.", "ESH but just you and the bf - leaving drunk with someone else\u2019s bf at 3am whilst planning to leave the gf at the party is clearly inappropriate.

He didn\u2019t even tell her that he was going to leave her there while he took you home. How can that not be seen as an issue? If she only has a problem with you and no other female friends then I think it\u2019s clear that you overstep some boundaries with your behaviour around him. If you had a bf that spent all their work time and their free time with another woman, took you to a party then they planned to leave with her who had ditched who they arrived with without even informing you, you\u2019d think it would be pretty sus.

I would say, though, to be prepared for your friend to either limit his contact with you and put some distance or expect him to be single. A relationship is about respect for each other's boundaries.

While I believe OP cares deeply about Aaron and his friendship, the factors above sort of imply to me that he is in the friendzone from his perspective and Id bet Aaron\u2019s girlfriend is aware of that from subtle clues.
