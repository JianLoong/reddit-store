We danced and had a good time together, we exchanged numbers and we became great friends. We never dated or anything like that, just friends. \n\nWe spend a lot of time together as he lives a few blocks from my house and we are also coworkers (we work in a music store, I started working there before and recommended him).  We like to go to parties and clubs, we often go together with other friends, almost never it's just the two of us. \n\nWell, five or six months ago he started dating one of his classmates \"Mia\" (f20). I'm a very extrovert person so I tried to be her friend when he introduce us but I could already tell she doesn't like me. Still I've tried until I realized it was a lost cause, I still treat her nicely enough, just don't try to be her friend as she clearly doesn't want to. \n\nShe has openly told me she thinks something fishy is happening between Aaron and I, we both assured her that was not the case. She thinks it's \"weird\" that me and her and both similar looking (not even that much, I guess she's saying this and we're both Asians, but our styles are totally different). I think that's the main issue with her as she doesn't seem to dislike any of Aaron's female friends besides me. \n\nAnyway. Yesterday we were at a party in a friend's house. I got there with a friend, but asked Aaron if he can drive me home (he never drinks so it's the safest way). Mia was there too. Around 3AM Aaron asked me if I wanted to leave already (we worked on Friday so we were kinda tired) I said ok, then Mia started making a big drama because she \"didn't know any of this\" and Aaron was \"supposed to leave with her and not his side bitch\" along with some other stuff. I was very annoyed at that point so I told her something like \"leave me the f alone, I would've wanted to fuck Aaron I would have done it ages ago\". She started crying because that \"confirmed her suspicions\" (it didn't, but she was drunk so she might have understood wrong) and she asked someone to call an Uber for her. Aaron and her went outside to talk and apparently had a fight as he went back inside and asked me to wait for a bit until the Uber arrived, he was afraid that she'll leave with some drunk friend. We waited like half and hour and then left the party after Mia took her own drive home. \n\nI didn't wanted to ask Aaron about what happened (and tbh I was too drunk and tired to care) but this morning I woke up feeling very much like an asshole. I know Mia gets very weird when she's drunk and also know that I probably made her feel more insecure.

She shouldn't be burdening you with them. You might have blurted out something that seems rude but it wasn't uncalled for because she was the one who said something uncalled for.   \n\n\nFirst of all she called you a \"side bitch\".

If you were a guy, she wouldn't have cared at all. She only got upset because she thinks something is going on between you two.   \n\n\nJealousy often comes from the fear that you're not enough and your partner will leave you. She has to deal with that herself otherwise she's going to find someone else to be jealous over if it isn't you.   \n\n\nMaybe Aaron has had a thing for you, maybe his girlfriend picked up on this, but so what?

He didn\u2019t even tell her that he was going to leave her there while he took you home. How can that not be seen as an issue? If she only has a problem with you and no other female friends then I think it\u2019s clear that you overstep some boundaries with your behaviour around him. If you had a bf that spent all their work time and their free time with another woman, took you to a party then they planned to leave with her who had ditched who they arrived with without even informing you, you\u2019d think it would be pretty sus.

INFO please!", "YTA or ESH because you put Arron in a position to drive you home and have his girlfriend Uber rather than the other way around. Also Arron made the situation worse by not telling his girlfriend before you two were getting ready to leave. Arron also could have offered to take you both home and dropped you off before his girlfriend. Because you and Arron know how she feels you egged it on rather than bad empathy.

I thought that if I respected her wishes that she would get less insecure, but that never happened. I was young, stupid, and insecure myself, so I never caught onto the abuse and manipulation until it was too late.\n\nShe's jealous and insecure, and that isn't your problem. I would say, though, to be prepared for your friend to either limit his contact with you and put some distance or expect him to be single. A relationship is about respect for each other's boundaries. She isn't respecting his relationship with you, while he also isn't respecting her feelings by staying close with you. Neither of them are wrong or right, but a relationship can not work like that and is doomed unless one person caves into the other person. \n l\nSorry you're in that position with your friend OP.

I can't be sure, but I am completely sure that insecure people project their fears on others.

OP yields a power she doesn\u2019t realize and needs to reign it in.  Aaron needs to find a way to balance his relationship with having a close female friend. \n\nI am a married woman with male friends.  The only way to make that work is to always put your romantic partner above everyone else and to also set very strict boundaries with your opposite sex friends.  \n\nAlso, maybe both women need to drink less and party less.

That's what I mean but never has he told me he liked me or have I developed feelings for him, we're just friends. \n\nWhen I say Mia acts weird when she gets drunk I mean she says stuff that she doesn't mean to. Like once (at the very start of hers and Aaron relationship) we went to a club together and suddenly after many drinks she told us her family hated her and think she's a failure. We got worried about her because her family sounded very toxic so we asked the next day if she needed help or something, she said that's not how her family is and she didn't knew why she said that. It has happened in other occasions too. \n\nMia was offered a ride home. Aaron was gonna drive me home and then they were gonna sleep in his apartment (my house is near his).

I don't know how to approach her to make her feel secure about her relationship.", "This is an incredibly unhealthy way to look at this, wow. She should not have to stop being friends with someone she\u2019s been friends with for years because his new girlfriend of a few months is insecure and jealous. It\u2019s not emotionally cheating to have friends you\u2019re close to, goodness. This is not her fault nor her problem really. This is between Aaron and his gf. They need to sit down and have a long talk, and decide if either of them are willing to shift their stance. If not, it\u2019s not going to work long term anyways because someone that insecure will just pick a new target over and over again until she finally has him alone.

Maybe Mia didn't want that and made a scene. Just a thought.", "Yeah, we'd need to know what Aaron had discussed with his gf before the party.

Aaron has had a female friend for three years and his new girlfriend Mia is too insecure to handle it. They are not right for each other.", "u/Sepasdfgh is possibly a bot.

So I wouldn't call that weird really.", "Why couldn't you get an uber and they both would leave? Wouldn't it have solved the whole issue? Also if she's acting weird after drinking, wouldn't it be better for Aaron to drive her since that's what Mia assumed was gonna happen?", "I'm gonna give this an ESH but you only slightly....in the future, if Aaron and his gf are having problems, go on your own way. They clearly have shit they need to sort and you hanging around doesn't help. She wasn't right to take her insecurities out on you but they are pretty common and understandable.", "You all need to grow up. ESH", "Nah she views Aaron as some kind of orbiting fan that she can use as she pleases. Seriously explain having the gf Uber home while OP gets the personal chauffeur service from this girls boyfriend? OP thinks she\u2019s the main character.\nAnd by assuming Aaron of course will drive her home she\u2019s flexing on that other girl and showing that she has priority with that girls boyfriend \n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t want this girls boyfriend, because she sees this girls boyfriend as just one of her many admirers that she would never settle for, though hes good enough for this supporting character girl", "I disagree. I don\u2019t think they have a healthy friend relationship and it\u2019s probably closer to a friendzone friendship. The OP screaming I could have fucked him if I wanted to years ago implies there is more to Aaron\u2019s feelings than friendship. \n\nI\u2019m also of the belief that male female relationships are amazing BUT there have to be clear social boundaries and the impression I get here is that the boundaries are unclear and Aaron is in love with OP. There is no other explanation for him literally telling OP he was leaving before his GF. When you are in a romantic relationship you generally have to put your romantic partner first within reason. It seems like Aaron puts OP first and his girlfriend. That is unworkable. You may disagree with me but I\u2019d bet that Aaron will never maintain a healthy romantic relationship so long as he\u2019s hanging out with OP several times a week, including times when they are alone. I would not be cool with my wife getting dinner and drinks or hanging out regularly alone with an attractive single straight man, nor would she be cool with me going to a female friends apartment and getting drunk alone frequently. \n\nIf you\u2019ve made these type of male female relationships work while maintaining a healthy romantic relationship more power to ya!", "That's not how it reads.  OP got to the party on her own, then arranged for Aaron for take her home once they were there.  Aaron asked the OP if she was ready to go, and per the OP (we weren't their) it was not only a surprise to Mia, but the way the OP quotes her, it was just Aaron and the OP about to head out.  \"He's supposed to go home with me, not his side bitch\", would indicate she was excluded from Aaron's ride out the gate.", "He left with his friend of 3 years....Who he has been around drunk multiple times....Because their favourite thing to do together is go clubbing and according to OP he doesn't drink often and nothing has ever happened between them.\n\nWhy are we making this man out to be a creep? He's clearly got a good friendship with her. Also OP has posted this after the ride home???? So clearly the BF didn't try anything....", "She was supposed to leave the party with us, they would leave me at my home and then they were going to stay at Aaron's home together", "Nah... It's just a crude way of saying that if something we're going to happen it would have happened a long time ago. OP hit a breaking point with this crazy chick. \n\nEdit: I read part of the OP wrong", "I get your point, but if a woman asks a man in his early 20s to have sex there's an extremely good chance he'll say yes even if there was never intimate feelings between them before.", "Hardly a male only privilege. I was at work the other week and when I went on my lunch break, sitting there minding my own business a couple of women colleagues come in discussing a \"mistake\" that one of them made at the weekend. I really didn't want to know but unfortunately they were talking loudly and my headphones were dead so I heard the entire spiel about one of them getting drunk and hooking up with a friends bf.\n\nWhy they thought it was a good idea to talk about it in a relatively occupied room at work is beyond me.", "I thought so too but Aaron said her family seems to be okay and they are happy she got into college. I haven't met her family so I can't be sure, but if she says everything is ok then I don't have another option but to believe her I guess.", "Wait, who\u2019s idea was it to get an Uber tho? OP or the drunk girlfriend going off on OP for being friends with her boyfriend? How is she flexing anything? How does she show she has priority over the gf? You\u2019re reaching big time. The gf is obviously insecure and you\u2019re an enabler. It is not okay to be rude to someone just because you don\u2019t like that they\u2019re friends with your partner. Op did nothing wrong, In fact she tried to be nice to the girl even after the disrespectful comments. She asked her friend for a ride home, he could\u2019ve said no, but he\u2019s HER FRIEND SO HE DID IT. His girlfriend was never not in the equation. She took it upon herself to call OP a \u201cside bitch\u201d and then got an Uber because she\u2019s mad. None of that is on OP. Idk if someone cheated on you or something but you\u2019re fucking projecting and it\u2019s nasty. If your partner did that to you, I\u2019m sorry, but maybe pick a better partner next time and don\u2019t go on the internet blaming others for your own relationship fails \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "OP said in a comment that Aaron was going to drive them both home because Mia was sleeping over and OP lives close by.

Mia is insisting there is something more than friends to their relationship, OP was trying to convince her that she\u2019s never had any interest because if she had it would have happened when they first met not years later.", "Why she says she didn't know any of this..? She was so drunk to forget that you three previously made arrangements for the drive back (and she agreed to those)? Or you did change the plans and she actually didn't know about your presence in the drive back?", "Why does she have to ride with you, why couldn't you find your own ride or your own uber. Why be dependent on a man whose with his GF that night?", "Even 20 year old guys aren't going horizontal with someone they find completely unappealing.", "Yes exactly! I don't know why I even said that but it was only a dumb comeback due to tiredness and being drunk!", "Family usually has 2 sides, private and public. It's your choice to believe her or not, so you do have options, just saying. I don't think your an AH, but I do think this girl has some issue she is possibly projecting on you.
