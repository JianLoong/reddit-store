We danced and had a good time together, we exchanged numbers and we became great friends. We never dated or anything like that, just friends. \n\nWe spend a lot of time together as he lives a few blocks from my house and we are also coworkers (we work in a music store, I started working there before and recommended him).  We like to go to parties and clubs, we often go together with other friends, almost never it's just the two of us. \n\nWell, five or six months ago he started dating one of his classmates \"Mia\" (f20). I'm a very extrovert person so I tried to be her friend when he introduce us but I could already tell she doesn't like me. Still I've tried until I realized it was a lost cause, I still treat her nicely enough, just don't try to be her friend as she clearly doesn't want to. \n\nShe has openly told me she thinks something fishy is happening between Aaron and I, we both assured her that was not the case. She thinks it's \"weird\" that me and her and both similar looking (not even that much, I guess she's saying this and we're both Asians, but our styles are totally different). I think that's the main issue with her as she doesn't seem to dislike any of Aaron's female friends besides me. \n\nAnyway. Yesterday we were at a party in a friend's house. I got there with a friend, but asked Aaron if he can drive me home (he never drinks so it's the safest way). Mia was there too. Around 3AM Aaron asked me if I wanted to leave already (we worked on Friday so we were kinda tired) I said ok, then Mia started making a big drama because she \"didn't know any of this\" and Aaron was \"supposed to leave with her and not his side bitch\" along with some other stuff. I was very annoyed at that point so I told her something like \"leave me the f alone, I would've wanted to fuck Aaron I would have done it ages ago\". She started crying because that \"confirmed her suspicions\" (it didn't, but she was drunk so she might have understood wrong) and she asked someone to call an Uber for her. Aaron and her went outside to talk and apparently had a fight as he went back inside and asked me to wait for a bit until the Uber arrived, he was afraid that she'll leave with some drunk friend. We waited like half and hour and then left the party after Mia took her own drive home. \n\nI didn't wanted to ask Aaron about what happened (and tbh I was too drunk and tired to care) but this morning I woke up feeling very much like an asshole. I know Mia gets very weird when she's drunk and also know that I probably made her feel more insecure.

She shouldn't be burdening you with them. You might have blurted out something that seems rude but it wasn't uncalled for because she was the one who said something uncalled for.   \n\n\nFirst of all she called you a \"side bitch\".

If you were a guy, she wouldn't have cared at all. She only got upset because she thinks something is going on between you two.   \n\n\nJealousy often comes from the fear that you're not enough and your partner will leave you. She has to deal with that herself otherwise she's going to find someone else to be jealous over if it isn't you.   \n\n\nMaybe Aaron has had a thing for you, maybe his girlfriend picked up on this, but so what?

I don't take stock in whatever drunk people say to each other.", "ESH but just you and the bf - leaving drunk with someone else\u2019s bf at 3am whilst planning to leave the gf at the party is clearly inappropriate.

He didn\u2019t even tell her that he was going to leave her there while he took you home. How can that not be seen as an issue? If she only has a problem with you and no other female friends then I think it\u2019s clear that you overstep some boundaries with your behaviour around him. If you had a bf that spent all their work time and their free time with another woman, took you to a party then they planned to leave with her who had ditched who they arrived with without even informing you, you\u2019d think it would be pretty sus.

In relationships (speaking to your friend), sometimes we deal with other peoples traumas/insecurities they acquired before being in that relationship. I have this same problem sometimes as a gay female with mostly female friends. Sometimes their partners get weird thinking there\u2019s something else going on there but it\u2019s like? No. I mean there\u2019s even a certain stage of friendship where if humankind\u2019s survival depending on us having sex I wouldn\u2019t be able to do it. You just don\u2019t see them in that way even if you date people of that same sex. It would be like having relations with someone you consider blood family.

Idk maybe invite her to lunch or something, be like hey. You\u2019re his partner, you\u2019re important in his life. I am not a threat. I am not trying to date your man. I want to be your friend too. I want the three of us and four if you have a partner to be friends. Sometimes you gotta meet people where they are before you can hope to meet them where they wanna be. I don\u2019t think Mia likes feeling this way. Maybe she just genuinely doesn\u2019t know how to deal with her emotions. It\u2019s not your problem to solve. It\u2019s not your emotions to deal with, I get it. Even the most stubborn of people won\u2019t stay that way in the face of love and compassion, it just takes time to build up from places that years of pain brought people to. I wish you the best. If this person continues to be toxic to you and to Aaron it\u2019s a sign that this person has not reached the emotional intelligence level to understand how to process their trauma. That\u2019s not a slight. People process their trauma differently. Trauma takes time.

They live only a few blocks away from each other and hes sober, so why wouldn't it make sense for a good friend to drop his friend off and make sure she reaches home safely?", "He would have mostly likely driven them all together, no one said they were gonna be alone.", "Idk about you but I\u2019ve met some cool people at the bar that I have no interest of dating, even if we date the same sex. I want to be your friend. Like we had a good conversation. I had a good time with you. I want to go to silly movies or hikes and bring your partner to! Knowing your partner is like another adventure of knowing you as a friend. They a big part of your life. If I met Stacy at a bar and we both like going to conventions doing cosplay. I want to be friends with Stacy. Matt, her partner, probably likes the same things to. So in essence, bonus friend is how I see it", "I mean the GF *did* tell Aaron he didn't want him taking her home", "The GF said she didn't want Aaron taking her home", "No part of it is a good look, including the way she said it to Mia. \n\nIncluding the getting that drunk and expecting this woman\u2019s bf to be the one to drive her home.\n\nThere\u2019s a very short window where behavior like that is slightly acceptable and it\u2019s college / early twenties, which they definitely are in, so it\u2019s fair if you just want to call it \u201cmessy\u201d but I stand by my take - it\u2019s not a good look. \n\nNo part of it is and I\u2019d call anyone annoyed by this behavior in a partner and their friend beyond reaonsable.", "Still, literally all of this is messy messy behavior. She\u2019s 21 so it\u2019s kinda socially acceptable still, but it\u2019s less and less so every year. Mia doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s particularly great, but she\u2019s well within reason to be annoyed by this.", "That\u2019s awesome then", "Mia is threatened by OP.", "It was an issue because Mia is a messy drama queen.", "OP and this guy have been friends for years and live close to each other. OP should not have to Uber just to appease the insecurities of a new gf.", "From the context of her post it sounded like it was just Aaron and OP leaving. So I\u2019m a bit confused at that bit (apparently commenters said they were all planning to leave together, but I guess I missed that detail in the comments).\n\nIf OP just wanted to carpool, then I would say the girlfriend overreacted. But this sounds like an issue that Aaron and Mia need to hash out. It\u2019s none of OP\u2019s business, and she needs to take a step back.", "Mind blown that you were downvoted wtf do people here not have friends??", "His GF was supposed to be in the car with them - how exactly could he try his luck in this situation?", "Considering OP changes her story in the comments, I get the impression we don\u2019t have the entire story. I absolutely believe the girlfriend overreacted and is insecure, but why does OP\u2019s story keep changing?", "Exactly! It\u2019s blowing my mind that everyone here assumes 21 year olds at house parties have so much Uber money! We didn\u2019t have Uber back then but most of us were still scrounging for bus fare.", "I'm calling in my reservations because I want the main course", "Haha! Thank you! I... I love you too?", "You must be the gf you sound insecure."]}
