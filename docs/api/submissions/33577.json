I even gave her our keys.\n\nThe day she picked us up from the airport, I asked her if she had stopped by our house while we were away. She said no, which honestly was disappointing and confusing. Even if she didn't remember my request, I thought my daughter would be thoughtful enough to check our home to see everything was okay. But, I decided to not ask more about it and left it at that.\n\nA few months after we got back, my daughter took an apprenticeship where she had to live only an hour away from her apartment. She asked our son to occupy and housesit her place for 6 weeks, a much bigger request then we were even asking of her to just check our house for a 2 week vacation.\n\nAll of this has felt like a slight, and a bit self-absorbed on our daughter's part. I didn't feel it was a big enough point to bring up to her, but I did want to get it off my chest, so I have mentioned how I felt about this to my wife and son a couple of times.\n\nI just learned today that my son told our daughter about what we've been saying. He said that her explanation was that she simply \"didn't think about it\" (checking our house during the two weeks), but that's my point: the carelessness bothered me.

If she had, I could understand why you would be upset.  But you and your son are different people, and she's allowed to have a separate relationship with him that is distinct from her relationship with you.

If you have an issue, speak with her directly like an adult or get over it.", "N T A for **asking** your daughter but YTA for talking about her behind her back to your family rather than to her face. It seems like you don't want to resolve your issue (yours, no one else's), but just punish her. But what was the result of her failure? Nothing. So why does she need to be punished, at 26, for not dropping by your house while you were away for 2 weeks vacation when no plants needed watering, no pets needed feeding, no faulty furnace or freezing pipes needed checking? It seems like you're angry only because you were \"disobeyed\". Now that your daughter asks her adult brother (who lives with you) to house sit her home while she's away several weeks for work, you think he shouldn't do it because it's \"unfair\"? I assume you thought it was FAIR to ask your daughter for a favor. So why should it be UNFAIR for her to ask something similar, which actually has a huge benefit to your son? What young man living at home wouldn't jump at the chance to have his own place for 6wks? You're notion (as you put on a comment) that it was unfair for her to ask is bullshit. Your son is an adult and can make up his own mind if he wants to do it or not. It has nothing to do with you. Do you feel it would be FAIR for him to not do it? Isn't that exact behavior from your daughter why you are mad in the first place? You might want to ask yourself why you feel the need to try to control your adult children in this way, and also, as an adult yourself, why would you not speak to your daughter directly rather than talking about her behind her back to others? What do you hope to accomplish with your behavior? Grow up dude.", "YTA - your attitude in general and the way you've gone about all of this (complaining to everyone else without once bringing it up with your daughter). And 6 weeks is triple the time you were on holiday. As per your other comments, it is quite normal to ask neighbours to check in on your home. You only asked your daughter to drive by the house - so why is it inappropriate in your mind to trust your neighbours to simply look out their window at your house??? Your logic doesn't add up and you sound very immature.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t ask daughter (more so demanded vaguely) and she didn\u2019t agree. \n\n30 mins is a long drive out of the way - you could\u2019ve asked her to housesit if it was that important to you. Or you could\u2019ve asked and detailed what you expected and waited for a confirmed \u201cyes\u201d from her. You also chose to complain about her to her brother, who unsurprisingly, told her. YTA for not bringing up an adult feeling to another adult and instead badmouthing them to others. \n\nA 20 year old that lives at home sees housesitting as a luxury of privacy and freedom. Your daughter is right - it\u2019s not comparable.", "YTA\n\nEven if she agreed to check on your house (which it sounds like you didn't really ask) and failed to do so, does that mean she can never have favors from anyone for the rest of her life? I would understand if she asked you and you chose to say no, but you're really upset that her brother is helping her out? That's so confusing to me. It has nothing to do with you.", "Given how you treat your daughter and son can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised. YTA", "ESH. She should have checked on the house since it sounds like she agreed to it. I disagree with your feeling that she should have anyways.\n\nI also disagree that her having your son house sit is comparable.\nYour request is in many ways a much more annoying inconvenient chore. Also it sounds like your son lives with you, and I can say from experience that house-sitting when living with your parents is sometimes a nice change of pace.\n\nBut what makes you also TA is complaining about it enough to your son that he felt compelled to talk to your daughter about it. Have adult conversations with your adult kids if you're upset with their actions.", "I don't think YTA for feeling slighted or even speaking to your wife. However if it wasn't important enough to speak to your daughter then you should not have involved your son.\n\nAlso, am I the only one who thinks it strange that your adult children don't already have keys to your home? All my siblings have keys to my parent's home so that we can respond to emergencies. Likewise my kids have keys to my home.  We also always give a heads up if we are dropping by.", "YTA. \n\nYou said you asked.

Are daughters the ones expected to take care of their elders while sons are held to different expectations?\n\nRegardless, is it reasonable to expect your adult child, who has all the demands of her own life, set aside whatever they\u2019ve got going on to drive an hour just to drive by your house to make sure everything looks ok? Honestly, from my POV, it sounds like you targeted her to do this task specifically. Not because you didn\u2019t have other options that you could have utilized, but the sense I got was because you\u2019re entitled to her time. You being entitled to her time is more important to you than the idea that it is inconvenient for her. If she had another reason to be driving to your town and did a drive by all at the same time, that would have been one thing. But it sounds like you didn\u2019t actually ask and she didn\u2019t say she would. You just expected it to be her honor to spend her time and money to go look at your house while you, wife, and son are off on vacation. Despite the inferred fact that your daughter is busy working and living on her own. Despite the fact that there are other options out there more convenient to you all. But you would much rather inconvenience your daughter because you\u2019re entitled to inconvenience her, right? Because family? Because she\u2019s a woman? Because her building her life on her own isn\u2019t nearly as important as the honor of living up to your expectations?\n\nYes yes, a lot of assumptions on my end here but you have been *extremely* quiet on answering some questions from others, and what answers you have given are very short and I see an effort to not divulge anything that you know would make you look bad. You trying to pull the wool over our eyes won\u2019t shield you from the fact that you *know* you\u2019re being a turd. But you\u2019re the patriarchal head of the household and that\u2019s your right, innit?\n\nYou\u2019re being a petulant child. Giving someone a ridiculous charge to inconvenience themselves instead of choosing something that wouldn\u2019t inconvenience anyone but they\u2019re supposed to just \u201cdo it\u201d because you expected it, and airing out your grievance with your son, her brother, instead of talking to her about it directly, and then expecting him to take on your feelings on your behalf to get back at her. You just want to control people \u201cjust because\u201d of how you\u2019re related. Are you gonna control your adult son of going to stay in her apartment? You don\u2019t think we can\u2019t see that you\u2019re just trying to poison your son against his own sister so he\u2019ll not do it? Because you want control and want people to do your bidding?\n\nYour daughter and son aren\u2019t puppets, and you aren\u2019t a child. Grow up.", "YTA", "YTA.
