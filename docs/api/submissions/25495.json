It is about 30 minutes after putting child to sleep.  Jes is preparing for bed as well. And a severe thunderstorm watch alert goes out, with a possible tornado warning.  Outside is lightning show and strong winds visible.\n\nI tell Jes it is time to go down to the main floor.  We have a two story house and bedrooms are on the top floor.  She is visibly frustrated but agrees.  I wake up the children and bring them down to the couch.\n\nThe whole time we are waiting, Jes is complaining about not being able to get enough sleep.  And asking \"why can't I just go back up to the bed upstairs with the children, and come back down if it gets worse.\"  She kept calling it a thunderstorm, when I kept saying it is a 'severe' thunderstorm.\n\nI kept responding about how that isn't what you do when there is a severe thunderstorm and we need to wait longer.  The radar showed a swell of bad weather heading in our direction within the next half hour. Also, the beds are right next to big windows.\n\nReminder, she is normally the cautious one, so it was bothering me that she was downplaying the storm so much.\n\nAfter about 3 or 4 times of her doing this, I accused her of putting her need for sleep ahead of the children's safety.  I think I said something along the lines of \"your need for sleep isn't more important than the kids safety, stop downplaying the storm\".\n\nThat did not go over well.  What followed was a massive tongue lashing about how could I even say to her that she cares more about herself than the kids.  How she is not a bad mom.  How she has been so tired that whole day.\n\nI told her that I wasn't saying she was a bad mom, but in that moment she was being selfish with her needs.  And that sorry, the storm doesn't care how tired/sore you are.  None of that changes the fact we were under a severe thunderstorm warning, and I didn't think it was a good idea to have the kids upstairs.\n\nFortunately the storm pushed north of us and nothing more came of it in our area.\n\nUnfortunately she is using this as justification that she was right to suggest going up stairs all along.\n\nBut the storm north of us did result in a tornado.  Houses were damaged, and news is reporting a small death count.  So it could have just as easily been our area.\n\nSo AITA for telling my wife to stop being selfish with her need for sleep?\n\nedit:  A few people have asked why I didn't just let her go upstairs.  I didn't have a problem, if that is what she wanted to do.  But she wanted to bring the kids up with her, and that I had a problem with.

I have some anxiety around bad weather and a tornado watch or a high winds warning is enough to get me and my kid down to the basement but if I woke my kid up for every severe thunderstorm warning we would have done it the last two nights and three times in the three weeks before that.  Severe thunderstorm usually means don't drive anywhere or go outside.  You are being very cautious and casting judgment on people who are not the same hyper level of cautious is not a great look.  \n\nA gentle YTA.  Its fine if you want to be hyper cautious with the kids - but implying your wife is a bad parent is over the line.  Unless your house is fragile then the kind of weather that would take out the second floor would get an upgraded warning.  \n\nIf anyone is curious- tornado watch is less serious than a warning and comes if the conditions are right.  A tornado warning is very serious and you should immediately take cover.", "Where I grew up in the Midwest, there was a severe thunderstorm watch/warning probably 3/4 times a week during the summer. The storms just rolled in one after the other across the plains. \n\nIf we had freaked out about every one of them, we would have spent all summer huddled in the basement. As it was, we didn\u2019t fret much until the sky turned green. Then we booked it for home. And we didn\u2019t head for the basement until the tornado sirens went off.\n\nA severe thunderstorm watch just means conditions are ripe for a severe thunderstorm to develop. A ST warning means there\u2019s one nearby. In either case, you could have stayed in bed. Just pay attention and move fast when the tornado warning hits.", "YTA\n\n> a possible tornado warning\n\nA possible warning is NOT a warning. And a thunderstorm, even a severe one, is not a hurricane or tornado. You were premature here and messing with everyone's sleep that night.", "YTA. \n\nSleep isn't a \"selfish need.\" \n\nI'm really REALLY not understanding why you didn't just take the kids downstairs with you and let your grown-ass wife make decisions for herself.", "A thunderstorm watch is not a reason to do anything other than stay close to home. A thunderstorm warning you just stay inside. A tornado watch is stay inside and stay alert. A tornado warning is when you take cover in a basement or shelter. If I was getting ready for bed after putting kids to bed and my husband made everyone go downstairs for a severe thunderstorm WATCH then I\u2019d be mad as hell too. Wake me when we\u2019re in a tornado warning.", "YTA. I live in a place with severe storms. A severe thunderstorm is still just a thunderstorm. I don\u2019t get out of bed until the tornado sirens go off.", "YTA - its a thunderstorm. All you need to do is just stay in your house. There was no reason to wake up the kids or go downstairs.", "YTA because you accused your tired ill wife of selfishness as you overreacted to a thunderstorm and disrupted the children's routine during the start of school.\n\nGet a weather radio with NOAA alerts, learn the terms \"advisory\", \"watch\" and \"warning\", have a plan to grab those kids even if they're sound asleep and get them into a deeply sheltered space, and apologize to your wife.", "YTA.\nIt\u2019s a thunderstorm. You don\u2019t modify your routine for a thunderstorm. \n\nWhen the storm escalates, it creates a tornado watch. At that point if you feel the need to be overly cautious, you could go into your basement. \n\nBut most people don\u2019t actually do that until there\u2019s a tornado warning in their area, or the sirens are actively going off.\n\nLike damn.", "When a person is exhausted, they can\u2019t think clearly or logical. Many act as if drunk. While I understand your frustration what you said is about putting her needs in front of the kids\u2019 safety was OTP.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a tornado warning. \n\nYTA", "She didn't need to be told she was selfish for expressing her needs, in this case, the need to get some sleep, so kinda YTA. Instead you could have acted as if you agreed that her concern about getting sleep was also important, and been in a better position to succeed as her teammate that moment. If you assumed her concern about sleep was also important, your problem solving and conversation could have focussed on how to quickly get everyone to bed when it was over, how to make the morning easier, whether to set up sleeping downstairs. Maybe you could have offered to stay with the kids. You could have asked follow up questions about her concern about sleep - is work going to be ok?   Is something particularly difficult happening tomorrow?  \n\nLonger term you still have a chance to respond better to this - you could suggest coming up with a better plan that includes sleep if these storms are a frequent thing, such as having sleeping bags and bedding downstairs.  If it really seems like your wife was prioritizing her own sleep over the potential risk to her children, that is a strong sign that she is not getting enough sleep day to day and you may need to get involved in discussing and supporting her in that as well.

Thunderstorms happen. It\u2019s not that dramatic. Nobody needed to go downstairs.", "INFO: why isn't  Jess bedroom in the ground floor? since she has joint pain and fatigue?", "YTA - she has severe joint pain. After pregnancies I and many other women I know got weird auto immune disorders including joint pain causing ones  - I'm not saying this happened to her but unless you felt her pain you don't know", "YTA, I don't understand moving floors for any thunderstorm. Maybe I am desensitized from growing up in tornado alley, but that seems irrational, and a good way to make your kids scared of basic weather. \n\nMay have the possibility of tornados is also a silly thing. Watch the weather if you are worried.", "YTA\nI assume your wife suffers from a condition such as M.E/C.F.S or Fibromyalgia. I have both of these illnesses and unless you have suffered from something similar you will not understand how crippling the fatigue is. I certainly didn't until I developed these. If I miss out on sleep I am in so much pain I can barely walk. My brain fog has me not knowing if I'm on my head or my heels and I feel as if I'm swimming through treacle. You have no idea how it feels to go to bed exhausted and wake up the same way. Your wife is doing really well to cope looking after the house and children as it is, you don't mention whether or not she also works.Why couldn't you keep the children downstairs and let her go up to bed? I feel as though you were using this storm to punish her for having an illness you don't understand and show no signs of wanting to.", "Dude. Do you live in a Lego house? YTA.", "YTA. If we went into the basement for every storm, we would never leave. This whole thing is so weird, from your reactions to mentioning twice she is more usually the more cautious one, it just feelings like you are leaving info out.", "YTA.

Way to overreact and be insulting to your wife who was in pain.

You could've been more considerate. It's not selfish to be exhausted and wanting to sleep. It's a severe thunderstorm with a CHANCE of tornado, not even a full warning. You could've just said she can go sleep and you'll stay with the kids downstairs (not even a basement so whats the freaking difference) but you decided to be a jerk and call her selfish over what amounted to a storm and no actual tornado warning.", "Info: If a tornado hit your house, would being on the couch make any difference? Also, if she wanted to take the risk, why wasn\u2019t she allowed to go to bed?", "better safe than sorry I get it but soft YTA for saying what you said to your wife. \n\nThe windows were next to the beds, and during a severe thunderstorm as you stated could easily blow in something shattering the window and possibly injuring someone in your family. \n\nThat part you could have explained it to her if you haven't. Also your wife was clearly not in her right mind especially if she was fatigued. I for one could not think of others as well as I'd like to when I'm fatigued. NOT TIRED...fatigued. What was she doing that she was so tired from?\n\nYou could also be more understanding of her situation as well. \n\nThat's why SOFT YTA.

He didn\u2019t mention that so I think he\u2019s being ridiculous.", "East Texas, and we don\u2019t even take shelter for cloud rotations (nobody said we\u2019re a smart bunch). Until you see that tornado and it\u2019s coming straight for you, you don\u2019t move. Not until the debris is hitting all around you. THEN you stop recording and go in from the porch.\n\nAll kidding aside, those I describe above exist plentifully but even the rest of us don\u2019t take shelter in our makeshift bunkers until we hear the sirens go off. Seems like that\u2019s normal behavior based on the rest of these comments.", "In tornado alley it\u2019s like, \u201cDod someone actually see a tornado right here? Nah? We\u2019re good.\u201d", "But it was 9 pm.  Not 1 am.", "I grew up in tornado alley and we used to watch the tornadoes form on the front porch and would only take shelter for seriously extreme cases. OP totally overreacted.", "Part of Alabama here that hardly ever sees tornadoes. (But we sure as hell see severe thunderstorms.) Tornadoes scare the bejeezus out of me. Even I\u2019m not taking action until I hear sirens.", "So many people are talking about sirens.... we don't have that on the East Coast.  If you happen to have the TV on, or maybe you have your local TV station weather app on your phone, you might know about a tornado warning.  Otherwise, you just aren't really going to know about it.  In OP's case, I assume he must have had the TV on or it was in the news in advance (\"bad storms tomorrow, even a chance of a tornado\").  But yeah, even so you would wait for the warning. We have a surprising number of small/weak tornadoes or \"possibility of rotation\" every year, but the TV meteorologists will pre-empt all programming and will remain on the air live, showing where the rotation is, the direction it's going in and when it will get to various places. Unless you're the first place it appears.", "Especially with two very young children. NTA, OP. Better to be safe than sorry.  That being said, apologize to your wife.", "In the town next to the city me and my wife love in, where my wife's family lives there was literally no severe thunderstorm warning for a strong cell that I saw on radar before it went through (was headed our way but veered east at the last moment) the town and thought to myself why haven't they severe warned it yet? The whole city got blasted by straight line winds from the rear flank down draft that knocked trees and we're talking huge trees down all through the town including crushing houses and vehicles. Some parts of the town were without power for 3-4 days.\n\nWhile normally I wouldn't take my family downstairs etc. for a regular severe thunderstorm warning, if we do get a warning I'll at least look at it on radar and if it looks like it's going to be bad then that's a different story. I know that really doesn't apply to most who aren't a weather nerd like me lol but just pointing out severe thunderstorms can still be deadly.", "Are you talking about the storms in Michigan?", "Michigan last night? Those storms were fast moving and unusually severe. We had two confirmed tornadoes within 15 miles of our home, and rotation was detected a lot closer. I've never seen our pets so freaked out.", "I agree. Better safe than sorry. OP NTA", "It was green\u2026 I was there. Well more of a bile-yellow color, but worth sheltering from.", "We know you called her selfish and accused her of putting herself over her kids' safety because of the symptoms of her illness. YTA.", "Trust me, I 100% understand the frustration of getting annoyed by it all.  My husband has tried to kill himself 3 times because he thinks I will be better off, we've been married 28 years, the answer is I won't.  \n\nBy the way, you'd think I would be more freaked out by storms after getting hit with over $85k in hail and it busting out 9 windows, we had 5 animals with glass everywhere, kids were 9 and 14 at the time. Hubby was out of town for work. I sat down at 2:30am and made my claim to State Farm after getting the windows covered. \n\nWoo.", "She should check out CFS school, Website, Instagram for more info and recovery stories, it might be a way out. I feel for her, when you have fatigue and someone takes away your sleep it's a whole different ballgame and makes you irrational to a point people without it can't understand. I don't think either of you are the AH here. Try and make up, this is not worth it.", "What does her being a SAHM have anything to do with it? I've been one for 6 years and suffer from severe chronic pain and other issues that leave me exhausted when I wake up after a full night of sleep and in pain no matter what I do. I can't even scrub out a bath tub with out wearing myself out. Keeping a home and chasing after high energy little ones takes a lot of energy and it sounds like she's running on fumes or at least was at the time. She wasnt being unreasonable, you perceive it that way because you couldn't possibly understand what she's going through unless you've lived with that kind of energy depletion and pain. She probably already feels like she isn't a good enough mom because it's hard to keep up. You probably made one of her worst fears come true when you implied that. And maybe she did react sensitively to what you said but if I was in her position I'd have been mentally spent and probably reacted the same.", "Your ridiculous.. Thats all there is to it.. Period!", "YTA for describing taking care of your kids as picking up your wife\u2019s slack and freaking out during a thunderstorm.", "to me as someone who\u2019s mom has had rheumatoid arthritis for 15 years: this actually makes your insult that much worse. she is not able to be there for the kids as much and she probably feels like a bad mom already then you, her partner in life, accused her of putting her needs above the kids safety. it\u2019s like rubbing salt directly into her wound. that mixed with pure exhaustion, it\u2019s no wonder she blew up at you.", "Same here.  Supposedly our tornado sirens were going off but I think I've only heard of a couple people who confirmed hearing them.\n\nMultiple trees down on my street, an entire parking garage collapsed, and roofs ripped off houses.  That storm was nuts, one of the worst I can recall in 40 years.", "I live in Iowa.\n\nWhen the tornado warning comes, I go out to the front porch and look for it.\n\n\ud83d\ude05", "Yes. God, I know other people whose parents acted like this at every crack of thunder and they have terrible anxiety about the slightest inclement weather. My dad took me out on the porch as a baby during every thunderstorm and just acted like it was great. I only remember going to the basement twice, during tornado warnings.", "Like OP, my child\u2019s bed is next to a large window. I had to pull her out of bed once this summer because the wind was horrible during a storm. We lost power when a tree fell a street over (another fell on our street). Found out the next morning that we\u2019d had straight line winds in excess of 75 mph. Kiddo still has to be talked down from a panic when it starts to rain.", "Exactly. If it was a tornado, and you don't have a basement, you go to a room away from windows. Certainly not a living room.", "Michigan here, we had a severe thunderstorm last night.  I sat on the screen porch with my dog to watch it.", "OP does not know how to Midwest. Last time I heard a tornado siren I was in the grocery store parking lot and thought well, I\u2019m already here and got things to do today. Did my shopping and drove home just fine.", "Pff, we live on the county line and can hear both counties' sirens from our house. They blow them if there's even a hint of rotation anywhere in the county. Usual response to sirens? Meh.", "I have seen Twister at least 3 times, and I agree with you.", "Here too, and I would be so irritated if someone did this to me over a thunderstorm. You don\u2019t even come in off the porch for that.", "Do you ever see tornados or other dangerous weather events?", "Yup just spent 2 weeks camping in the storms in Cornwall, honestly can't imagine stopping everything for a thunderstorm", "49 MPH is like\u2026 a day ending in Y where I live.", "That's fair I guess. I didn't read every comment. It was pretty freaky where I was so I was giving benefit of the doubt.", "Yeah: 2 hours is a long time. If you\u2019re on a hike, sure, time to worry. But it takes all of two minutes to move within your house.", "I was in this storm. We went from a severe thunderstorm watch straight into a tornado warning, with the sirens sounding 4-5 mins after I received the warning on my phone. So it\u2019s definitely strange, but it did happen here. Got to say I wasn\u2019t prepared at *all* for the tornado warning, had to load up my dad and his dog from his trailer and get the hell out of dodge fast. Luckily we weren\u2019t hit hard in my county, I think it was just radar-indicated rotation.", "> If there was a take cover now message, then that would\u2019ve been accompanied by a warning of some kind beyond severe thunderstorms.\n\nThere was. In addition to the severe thunderstorm warning, there was also a \"possible tornado warning.\" That's the additional warning. Different areas have different alarm protocols, but where I am it says \"current conditions could cause a tornado, take cover immediately if strong weather approaches\" or something like that. OP did that.", "Also, who says sirens will go off on time? Then he has to get 2 sleeping kids out of bed and go downstairs. That takes precious seconds when a tornado is on the way. Not to mention any pets that need to be secured downstairs\u2026 better to go down there calmly to avoid the kids freaking out. He\u2019s talking about going from upstairs bedrooms to the main level of a 2 story house. He didn\u2019t take them to hunker in a crawl space or Michigan basement (it\u2019s a thing).

I have trees in my yard and we\u2019ve sustained a lot more than that. But they\u2019re very healthy trees. If you\u2019re losing major limbs, you need to get that tree looked at. Some wind should not cause that to happen.", "49 MPH\n\nSo it was just a regular thunderstorm.  Lol", "Then cut them down before the next storm, if you're that concerned and need to remove them from their bedrooms every time you get some wind. \n\n# YTA", "Are you from the PNW?

Gross.", "Did you make your house out of straw or sticks?", "Umm you live in Michigan.

Tornados aren\u2019t the only things that cause trees and limbs to fall on peoples houses and kill them.
