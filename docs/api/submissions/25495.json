It is about 30 minutes after putting child to sleep.  Jes is preparing for bed as well. And a severe thunderstorm watch alert goes out, with a possible tornado warning.  Outside is lightning show and strong winds visible.\n\nI tell Jes it is time to go down to the main floor.  We have a two story house and bedrooms are on the top floor.  She is visibly frustrated but agrees.  I wake up the children and bring them down to the couch.\n\nThe whole time we are waiting, Jes is complaining about not being able to get enough sleep.  And asking \"why can't I just go back up to the bed upstairs with the children, and come back down if it gets worse.\"  She kept calling it a thunderstorm, when I kept saying it is a 'severe' thunderstorm.\n\nI kept responding about how that isn't what you do when there is a severe thunderstorm and we need to wait longer.  The radar showed a swell of bad weather heading in our direction within the next half hour. Also, the beds are right next to big windows.\n\nReminder, she is normally the cautious one, so it was bothering me that she was downplaying the storm so much.\n\nAfter about 3 or 4 times of her doing this, I accused her of putting her need for sleep ahead of the children's safety.  I think I said something along the lines of \"your need for sleep isn't more important than the kids safety, stop downplaying the storm\".\n\nThat did not go over well.  What followed was a massive tongue lashing about how could I even say to her that she cares more about herself than the kids.  How she is not a bad mom.  How she has been so tired that whole day.\n\nI told her that I wasn't saying she was a bad mom, but in that moment she was being selfish with her needs.  And that sorry, the storm doesn't care how tired/sore you are.  None of that changes the fact we were under a severe thunderstorm warning, and I didn't think it was a good idea to have the kids upstairs.\n\nFortunately the storm pushed north of us and nothing more came of it in our area.\n\nUnfortunately she is using this as justification that she was right to suggest going up stairs all along.\n\nBut the storm north of us did result in a tornado.  Houses were damaged, and news is reporting a small death count.  So it could have just as easily been our area.\n\nSo AITA for telling my wife to stop being selfish with her need for sleep?\n\nedit:  A few people have asked why I didn't just let her go upstairs.  I didn't have a problem, if that is what she wanted to do.  But she wanted to bring the kids up with her, and that I had a problem with.

I have some anxiety around bad weather and a tornado watch or a high winds warning is enough to get me and my kid down to the basement but if I woke my kid up for every severe thunderstorm warning we would have done it the last two nights and three times in the three weeks before that.  Severe thunderstorm usually means don't drive anywhere or go outside.  You are being very cautious and casting judgment on people who are not the same hyper level of cautious is not a great look.  \n\nA gentle YTA.  Its fine if you want to be hyper cautious with the kids - but implying your wife is a bad parent is over the line.  Unless your house is fragile then the kind of weather that would take out the second floor would get an upgraded warning.  \n\nIf anyone is curious- tornado watch is less serious than a warning and comes if the conditions are right.  A tornado warning is very serious and you should immediately take cover.", "Where I grew up in the Midwest, there was a severe thunderstorm watch/warning probably 3/4 times a week during the summer. The storms just rolled in one after the other across the plains. \n\nIf we had freaked out about every one of them, we would have spent all summer huddled in the basement. As it was, we didn\u2019t fret much until the sky turned green. Then we booked it for home. And we didn\u2019t head for the basement until the tornado sirens went off.\n\nA severe thunderstorm watch just means conditions are ripe for a severe thunderstorm to develop. A ST warning means there\u2019s one nearby. In either case, you could have stayed in bed. Just pay attention and move fast when the tornado warning hits.", "YTA\n\n> a possible tornado warning\n\nA possible warning is NOT a warning. And a thunderstorm, even a severe one, is not a hurricane or tornado. You were premature here and messing with everyone's sleep that night.", "YTA. \n\nSleep isn't a \"selfish need.\" \n\nI'm really REALLY not understanding why you didn't just take the kids downstairs with you and let your grown-ass wife make decisions for herself.", "A thunderstorm watch is not a reason to do anything other than stay close to home. A thunderstorm warning you just stay inside. A tornado watch is stay inside and stay alert. A tornado warning is when you take cover in a basement or shelter. If I was getting ready for bed after putting kids to bed and my husband made everyone go downstairs for a severe thunderstorm WATCH then I\u2019d be mad as hell too. Wake me when we\u2019re in a tornado warning.", "YTA. I live in a place with severe storms. A severe thunderstorm is still just a thunderstorm. I don\u2019t get out of bed until the tornado sirens go off.", "YTA - its a thunderstorm. All you need to do is just stay in your house. There was no reason to wake up the kids or go downstairs.", "YTA because you accused your tired ill wife of selfishness as you overreacted to a thunderstorm and disrupted the children's routine during the start of school.\n\nGet a weather radio with NOAA alerts, learn the terms \"advisory\", \"watch\" and \"warning\", have a plan to grab those kids even if they're sound asleep and get them into a deeply sheltered space, and apologize to your wife.", "YTA.\nIt\u2019s a thunderstorm. You don\u2019t modify your routine for a thunderstorm. \n\nWhen the storm escalates, it creates a tornado watch. At that point if you feel the need to be overly cautious, you could go into your basement. \n\nBut most people don\u2019t actually do that until there\u2019s a tornado warning in their area, or the sirens are actively going off.\n\nLike damn.", "When a person is exhausted, they can\u2019t think clearly or logical. Many act as if drunk. While I understand your frustration what you said is about putting her needs in front of the kids\u2019 safety was OTP.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a tornado warning. \n\nYTA", "She didn't need to be told she was selfish for expressing her needs, in this case, the need to get some sleep, so kinda YTA. Instead you could have acted as if you agreed that her concern about getting sleep was also important, and been in a better position to succeed as her teammate that moment. If you assumed her concern about sleep was also important, your problem solving and conversation could have focussed on how to quickly get everyone to bed when it was over, how to make the morning easier, whether to set up sleeping downstairs. Maybe you could have offered to stay with the kids. You could have asked follow up questions about her concern about sleep - is work going to be ok?   Is something particularly difficult happening tomorrow?  \n\nLonger term you still have a chance to respond better to this - you could suggest coming up with a better plan that includes sleep if these storms are a frequent thing, such as having sleeping bags and bedding downstairs.  If it really seems like your wife was prioritizing her own sleep over the potential risk to her children, that is a strong sign that she is not getting enough sleep day to day and you may need to get involved in discussing and supporting her in that as well.

Thunderstorms happen. It\u2019s not that dramatic. Nobody needed to go downstairs.", "INFO: why isn't  Jess bedroom in the ground floor? since she has joint pain and fatigue?", "YTA - she has severe joint pain. After pregnancies I and many other women I know got weird auto immune disorders including joint pain causing ones  - I'm not saying this happened to her but unless you felt her pain you don't know", "YTA, I don't understand moving floors for any thunderstorm. Maybe I am desensitized from growing up in tornado alley, but that seems irrational, and a good way to make your kids scared of basic weather. \n\nMay have the possibility of tornados is also a silly thing. Watch the weather if you are worried.", "YTA\nI assume your wife suffers from a condition such as M.E/C.F.S or Fibromyalgia. I have both of these illnesses and unless you have suffered from something similar you will not understand how crippling the fatigue is. I certainly didn't until I developed these. If I miss out on sleep I am in so much pain I can barely walk. My brain fog has me not knowing if I'm on my head or my heels and I feel as if I'm swimming through treacle. You have no idea how it feels to go to bed exhausted and wake up the same way. Your wife is doing really well to cope looking after the house and children as it is, you don't mention whether or not she also works.Why couldn't you keep the children downstairs and let her go up to bed? I feel as though you were using this storm to punish her for having an illness you don't understand and show no signs of wanting to.", "Dude. Do you live in a Lego house? YTA.", "YTA. If we went into the basement for every storm, we would never leave. This whole thing is so weird, from your reactions to mentioning twice she is more usually the more cautious one, it just feelings like you are leaving info out.", "YTA.

Way to overreact and be insulting to your wife who was in pain.

You could've been more considerate. It's not selfish to be exhausted and wanting to sleep. It's a severe thunderstorm with a CHANCE of tornado, not even a full warning. You could've just said she can go sleep and you'll stay with the kids downstairs (not even a basement so whats the freaking difference) but you decided to be a jerk and call her selfish over what amounted to a storm and no actual tornado warning.", "Info: If a tornado hit your house, would being on the couch make any difference? Also, if she wanted to take the risk, why wasn\u2019t she allowed to go to bed?", "better safe than sorry I get it but soft YTA for saying what you said to your wife. \n\nThe windows were next to the beds, and during a severe thunderstorm as you stated could easily blow in something shattering the window and possibly injuring someone in your family. \n\nThat part you could have explained it to her if you haven't. Also your wife was clearly not in her right mind especially if she was fatigued. I for one could not think of others as well as I'd like to when I'm fatigued. NOT TIRED...fatigued. What was she doing that she was so tired from?\n\nYou could also be more understanding of her situation as well. \n\nThat's why SOFT YTA.

Soon after, a tornado warning alert went off on my phone and a tornado, confirmed EF1 this morning, did touch down within a few miles. My house was completely fine. Michigan is on some maps at the tip of tornado alley. We sometimes get them, and they're usually EF1 or Ef0 most of the time. This usually brings tree damage, roof damage, possibly window damage if debris is flying around and hits your house in the right spot. A tornado basically has to be on top of your house in this case to cause substantial damage, but straight line winds are also a danger. \n\nAll that to say, OP may not have been aware of the specific warnings and watches that night. And meteorologists will always advise people to move to the interior, lowest level of a house away from windows during a severe thunderstorm out of an abundance of caution.

With advanced technology, we can see the crossroads of a tornado on radar instead of having a warning cause sirens to go off all over your county. It's good to be aware during a storm and pay attention, check the news etc., but it's unrealistic to think everyone needs to go to the basement every time a storm rolls through the area.\n\nAlso, why couldn't he keep the kids downstairs and let her go to bed? The low pressure of the storm probably wasn't doing her joint pain and fatigue any favors.", "I encountered the taco watch/warning meme for the first time this spring - it cracks me up every time but it really did help sear the difference between a watch and a warning. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/_PyintheSky/status/1424824296543821834 one of the many variations.", "It's the \"unusually severe\" part for me. The weather had been straight up ominous, and in my forty years, I've never seen anything quite like it. I am not usually worried about a severe thunderstorm warning. Last night I was.", "That calm before the storm was very real last night right before the sky ripped open..", "The one near/over i-96 continued for TEN miles, ef2.", "When I was in grade 8, in Canada, there was a storm brewing, and I remember a kid in class telling us that it might be a tornado cause the sky was sorta greenish.\n\nI've definitely held onto that tiny bit of trivia for the last 30+ years, despite the fact that there has been almost zero hurricanes/tornadoes here, ever.", "I\u2019m very familiar with the green sky concept", "Over 75% of the world's tornados happen in the US, and it's much more common in some states than others. \n(Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, and Minnesota are usually the core states used to define \"Tornado Alley\" conditions, ([maps are fun!](https://www.amnh.org/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/amnh/images/ology-images-folder/super-article-imagery/tornados-spinning-thunderstorms-imagery/tornado-alley-map/1666620-1-eng-US/tornado-alley-map_full_990.jpg)) but [recent research](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/watch-out-tornado-alley-is-migrating-eastward/) has suggested the \"alley\" is traveling eastward and will impact the central-eastern US more frequently in the future. \n\nThere are places in the US where you could reasonably associate \"bad storm\" with \"I hope that doesn't mean tornado risk\", but it's less common to think \"bad storm\" absolutely equals \"immediately shelter for impending tornado risk\" unless an actual tornado warning is sent out. \n\n...Despite tornado alley (& neighboring states) being the overall region where most tornadoes occur, the most tornadoes per land area actually happen in Florida. Because when *aren't* the gods smiting Florida?", "Actually, it IS recommended you go to an interior room (just away from windows) for a severe thunderstorm.", "Possibly he's got a phobia of thunderstorms and doesn't want to admit it. My brother, bless him, goes to great lengths to insist that his fear of being attacked by crocodiles in our local wetland has a rational basis and cannot be a phobia - despite the fact that we live in England. Dunno if it's a masculinity thing or a non-gendered shame thing but I think some people really can't admit to themselves that they've got a 'weak' point in the form of a phobia so they push it down deep and dig in on believing they're the only ones behaving rationally,"]}
