I hadn\u2019t met my in laws that much because they live in another country, but they wanted to come and see the baby, which I was more than happy to accommodate. I prepared the spare bedroom for them, bought lots of food for their arrival and cooked all of their meals during their stay, which was exhausting while juggling a new baby and really struggling with breastfeeding, but I was happy to do it for my in-laws. \n\nMy ownership of the house predates my relationship with my husband and is a large 6 bedroom house with 4 bathrooms. We have one, we keep one for guests and the other 4 are rented out to lodgers. All lodgers were carefully selected and are like part of our family, they were very kind to my in-laws during their stay. \n\nNow the issue; my MIL(61) didn\u2019t want to share a bathroom with my lodgers and wanted to use my en-suite (which would involve walking through my bedroom and my dressing room). For health reasons she likes to lay down after a shower and didn\u2019t want to use any of the other 3 bathrooms because it would either involve walking through the house in a dressing gown or the pyjamas that she\u2019d slept in, or having to get dressed and undressed again (the spare bedroom is on the top floor next to the master so this would have been somewhat negated by using the en-suite). Normally I am not precious about these things but pretty much all the time I was in my room I had my boobs out desperately trying to feed my son. I was still leaking lots so the entire room smelled of off milk and there was often washing all over the place from where I was struggling to keep up with things. I really didn\u2019t like the idea of this space being intruded upon and politely declined, saying she was very welcome to use any one of the other bathrooms. Initially she burst into tears about this and I was made to feel really bad for saying no, but knowing it would make me unable to cope with the visit I stuck to my guns. \n\nAt the end of the 4/5 day visit I was getting ready to drive them to the airport for their flight home and my MIL pointed out how uncomfortable she was staying in my home and that it was an uncomfortable place for her to be. This really hurt me because not only did I expend lots of energy on hosting, but also, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time and money renovating my home to a high standard over the last 5 years and am very proud of it. \n\nThe fact that my in laws are still adamant I was an AH for this make me wonder whether it might be the case, so I thought I\u2019d throw it out there\u2026..\n\nEdit: A lot of people have asked about where my husband was. He did help me with cleaning and preparing the house. Generally my husband is very helpful with childcare and the house. However, he\u2019s been very hesitant to stand up for me with his family so while he tried to explain to MIL why it was important to me to have my privacy and tried to deescalate things, he never set a boundary that it wasn\u2019t appropriate for them to act as they did (and also wouldn\u2019t acknowledge this to me).", "created_utc": 1691148668, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15hxkn6/aita_for_not_allowing_my_mil_to_use_my_ensuite/", "score": 1833, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
