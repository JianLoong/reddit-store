I hadn\u2019t met my in laws that much because they live in another country, but they wanted to come and see the baby, which I was more than happy to accommodate. I prepared the spare bedroom for them, bought lots of food for their arrival and cooked all of their meals during their stay, which was exhausting while juggling a new baby and really struggling with breastfeeding, but I was happy to do it for my in-laws. \n\nMy ownership of the house predates my relationship with my husband and is a large 6 bedroom house with 4 bathrooms. We have one, we keep one for guests and the other 4 are rented out to lodgers. All lodgers were carefully selected and are like part of our family, they were very kind to my in-laws during their stay. \n\nNow the issue; my MIL(61) didn\u2019t want to share a bathroom with my lodgers and wanted to use my en-suite (which would involve walking through my bedroom and my dressing room). For health reasons she likes to lay down after a shower and didn\u2019t want to use any of the other 3 bathrooms because it would either involve walking through the house in a dressing gown or the pyjamas that she\u2019d slept in, or having to get dressed and undressed again (the spare bedroom is on the top floor next to the master so this would have been somewhat negated by using the en-suite). Normally I am not precious about these things but pretty much all the time I was in my room I had my boobs out desperately trying to feed my son. I was still leaking lots so the entire room smelled of off milk and there was often washing all over the place from where I was struggling to keep up with things. I really didn\u2019t like the idea of this space being intruded upon and politely declined, saying she was very welcome to use any one of the other bathrooms. Initially she burst into tears about this and I was made to feel really bad for saying no, but knowing it would make me unable to cope with the visit I stuck to my guns. \n\nAt the end of the 4/5 day visit I was getting ready to drive them to the airport for their flight home and my MIL pointed out how uncomfortable she was staying in my home and that it was an uncomfortable place for her to be. This really hurt me because not only did I expend lots of energy on hosting, but also, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time and money renovating my home to a high standard over the last 5 years and am very proud of it. \n\nThe fact that my in laws are still adamant I was an AH for this make me wonder whether it might be the case, so I thought I\u2019d throw it out there\u2026..\n\nEdit: A lot of people have asked about where my husband was. He did help me with cleaning and preparing the house. Generally my husband is very helpful with childcare and the house. However, he\u2019s been very hesitant to stand up for me with his family so while he tried to explain to MIL why it was important to me to have my privacy and tried to deescalate things, he never set a boundary that it wasn\u2019t appropriate for them to act as they did (and also wouldn\u2019t acknowledge this to me).", "created_utc": 1691148668, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15hxkn6/aita_for_not_allowing_my_mil_to_use_my_ensuite/", "score": 412, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were probably trying to feed on demand, adjusting to the pains after childbirth and your room wasn't presentable (was she going to lie down on your bed?).\n\n *I prepared the spare bedroom for them, bought lots of food for their arrival and cooked all of their meals during their stay, which was exhausting while juggling a new baby and really struggling with breastfeeding, but I was happy to do it for my in-laws.*\n\nSounds like you tried to be a good host despite of learning your child and trying to cope with PPD.\n\n *my MIL pointed out how uncomfortable she was staying in my home and that it was an uncomfortable place for her to be.  This really hurt me because not only did I expend lots of energy on hosting, but also, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time and money renovating my home to a high standard over the last 5 years and am very proud of it.*\n\n *The fact that my in laws are still adamant I was an AH for this make me wonder whether it might be the case*\n\nShe might have been uncomfortable but this is your home. Your home, your rules. She does not get to dictate what the arrangements are in your home just as you can't do that in her house. Tell her, or better yet, have her son tell her that those are the rules of the house. She can either adjust or stay in a hotel the next visit.\n\nOP, you did nothing wrong. Your MIL has strange bathroom habits that you could not  accommodate. Next time point them to the nearest hotel.", "Info: was your husband aware that your in laws were present and behaving this unacceptable way? Because from your post it sounds like your husband wasnt involved in this visit.", "NTA\n\nWhen I visited my inlaws after giving birth, they gave US (my husband, our newborn, and myself) *THEIR* bedroom because it had an ensuite and was larger and they figured I needed more space for the baby. They also figured it would be easier for breastfeeding and for quick washes incase any accidents happened. It was sweet and I didn't ask them to do that, but it was so kind and helpful. \n\nAlso, I wonder if this is my misunderstanding, but I thought that when you visit a home with a newborn, you are not a guest. You're a helper. Is that not the case? \n\nI was taught not to visit new parents overnight unless you understand that you are there to help THEM.  Don't expect them to cater to you. Don't expect them to rearrange their living arrangements for you. You are there to help them with whatever they need. \n\nIf that's not something you want to do, then keep your visits under 2 hours. Anything after that, and I'll need you to watch the baby while I do the dishes/laundry/have a shower/cry myself to sleep...", "NTA. Sounds like the baby wasn't the only one still being breast fed. You have a husband problem.", "NTA. You have the right to privacy in your own bedroom. What did she want to do, lie on the bed beside you while you nursed? \n\nThe baby was probably still preventing you from getting a good night's sleep at this time and you wouldn't want her traipsing through your room while you catch some precious moments of rest while your little one napped.\n\nAt least if she was so uncomfortable in your home, she may not want to come back. \n\nWhat a terrible guest, she should have been helping you while you cared for the new baby.\n\nAnd as everyone else has said, your husband should have stood up for you!", "NTA. Guests, even family, are not entitled to your private space. Your husband needs to grow a spine. THis is not a subject to bring up anymore. Your MIL didn't want to use the bathroom provided, and wanted to use yours and your bed presumably (to lay down after her shower) while you were struggling with your body, the baby, and all the changes and mess that comes with bringing a new human into the world. On top of all this, you cooked for them (they didn't cook for you) and you drove them around. \n\nYour husband chose you to be a part of his family. HE now has a wife and a child and if he won't put them first, he needs to figure himself out. \n\nThey should have been catering to you, bringing you meals, cleaning up the place, running errands on your behalf. You just created a life.", "NTA and your husband sucks", "I stopped reading at \u201cmisbehaved\u201d because firstly, what, and also, it\u2019s been a year and a half! This is some ridiculous grudge", "Agree. And she had a C-section AND was struggling with PPD. If I had been in her shoes, I would not have hosted at all. If MIL felt so uncomfortable in OP's house, they could have stayed at a hotel.\n\nNTA and the fact that they still hold a grudge over this 18 months later and try to drive a wedge between you and your husband is very telling. Also, by the sound of it, you could have a husband problem. Why was it your job to host and cook for HIS PARENTS, prepare the guest room and drive them to the airport when you had a newborn? Why was it your job to communicate the bathroom boundary? Why didn't he stick up for you? Why is he even open to hearing them trash talk you behind your back?", "Seriously! She was made to cook for all of them. Essentially, the idea is for them to do it for you since you are a new mom. They are coming to help you out and not the other way around. If they were looking for a vacation - they are mammoth AH to spring it on a new mom like that. \n\nDid they not raise an objection when you were doing the chores?\n\nInfo: Is your husband away? What's his take on your so called \"misbehavior\"? Why is he not helping you?\n\nEdit : Also, your MIL is petty. A perpetual AH is what she is. NTA, OP.", "Yea, I admit, I got stuck on \u201cmisbehaved\u201d, too.  That word, from IL\u2019s, directed at a grown adult\u2026\ud83d\udea9.", "I was about to comment the same thing. He didn't act then, but he should shut them down now. Keeping the tiniest bit of privacy and comfort for yourself is beyond reasonable.", "\n>my MIL pointed out how uncomfortable she was staying in my home\n\nI am appalled at the audacity of the statement  Are these real people?", "It sounds like she wanted to air dry on OPs bed", "I am not at all standing up for MIL, just offering this as a partial explanation (NOT justification), some older generations will NOT be seen by non family in the clothes they sleep in. \n\nMy mom apologizes to ME when I come over and she isn't dressed yet.  She has no issue when I'm in my pj's or whatever. But even on vacation together, she has a hard time just being in her pj's around us.", "We did, we have a hot tub, so we always keep clean spare bathrobes on hand for guests to use and my husband had offered her this.", "Do you live somewhere with low humidity by chance?", "As soon as I saw that word I made my judgment, but finished reading to confirm. Definitely NTA.", "LOL. This reminds me of a wedding we went to 30 years ago! It was a supremely sexist wedding and the bride - one of the world\u2019s great ball busters - vowed to be \u2018amiable\u2019. Our necks almost snapped as we turned to each other to express our distain for the idea of amiability in a wife. So much so that we still laugh about it 30 years later \ud83d\ude09", "Good- maybe next time they will stay at a hotel or not come at all. They sound like very petty in-laws, she\u2019s not the ass for wanting a room to her self! It\u2019s 100% her house.. little hubby has no ownership in the house. So it\u2019s your call on everything!", "IKR??", "Well MIL can put on some sweats before she ventures out,", "Sure. But then it's on her to make sure that doesn't happen by dressing before she leaves the bathroom. Not on OP to give up her privacy.", "Which means it wasn't at all about any of the things she said, but was actually about showing that she was in charge and more important.", "If they are well off and uncomfortable in your home please recommend a good hotel for their next visit.\n\nThey were very poor house guests.\n\nI can understand how she may have health issues that make the previously acceptable sharing of the bathrooms a concern now.  However you were a new mum with some immediate health issues of your own.\n\nYour comfort wins hands down.\n\nNTA", "Agreed.  It's her problem to deal with, not throw a fit for everyone else to tiptoe around her sensibilities.", "I agree.  I said I wasn't defending.  The person I replied to said it made no sense.  I was adding some context, that's all.", "Gotcha!", "It's no longer safe for her to shower standing then. She needs a shower stool. And maybe an emergency alert button. \n\nYour husband should talk to her about that. As he should also be dealing with her abhorrent behavior."]}
