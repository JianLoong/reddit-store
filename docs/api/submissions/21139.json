Emily (30f) and Hayes (26m) with my ex-wife. She left me a few months after Hayes was born and ended up getting back together with her high school ex Sam. Sam and my ex ended up marrying seven months later. Emily has always adored Sam. I, however, hate the guy. For years he would work on getting under my skin, saying I wasn't a good enough dad to my daughter because I wasn't enough and she considered him her dad too. He'd tell me every single time she had called him Daddy Sam or Dad Sam. When I told him he was being childish he'd tell me in return that he knew it cut me up inside to have to share her affection as dad. He told me one day he would be walking her down the aisle and maybe she'd even want him to do it alone and would not want me anywhere near them for that.\n\nDespite all this Sam was never able to come between me and Emily and we have always been very close. Sam never cared for Hayes as much. I think Hayes being gay has a large part to play in Sam not caring for him as much as he does Emily.\n\nThere are times I had to restrain myself from exploding in front of the kids when Sam would taunt me. I knew he'd love a chance to get me out of my kids lives.\n\nLast year Sam was diagnosed with motor neuron disease. He's now in a wheelchair and has lost his mobility and his speech has suffered greatly.\n\nEmily is getting married in a few months and wanted us both to bring her down the aisle.\n\nA week ago she came to my house and told me she wanted to pay a special tribute to Sam and she wanted my help to do it (both finance and planning). I told her I would not help her with that. She was upset. Said Hayes refused to help her as well. She told me Sam means a lot to her and she would have thought I would be glad that she had two amazing father figures. I told her Sam and I did not have a positive relationship and there is no way I would ever spend my money or time doing something nice for the man. I told her he had treated me poorly over the years and I accepted she loved him. But he was not worthy of my money or that effort in my eyes. She asked me if I would do it for her. I told her I could not. She said okay.\n\nEmily's fiance called me up after this and said whatever petty issues between Sam and I, could I not do something for my daughter when she's going to lose one of her most special people. He said I was breaking Emily's heart because she doesn't want to be caught between us. That it's clear I am enjoying watching Sam suffer as he is and that's proven by my actions and I'm not being a good dad to Emily.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1688305645, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ooqxr/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_daughter_honor_her/", "score": 5761, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ask Emily why it was ok for Sam to dismiss Hayes because he was gay yet show her so much attention because she wasn't.  Her relationship with Sam is her own. She can't expect others to forget or ignore their own mistreat by Sam just to make her happy. She is an adult. She should know better.", "NTA OP\n\nActions have consequences. Tell fianc\u00e9 if he feels you're ruining his fianc\u00e9e's big day he can arrange for that along with his MIL's help. He will back out for sure once he hears it.\n\nAlso your daughter never felt bad when her stepdad was taunting you and her brother but now feels dejected that you aren't going out of your way to help that same man.", "NTA. You were perfectly willing to walk your daughter down the aisle with Sam and accept that she wants Sam in her life. You are not required to fork out anything financial for him, and if your daughter wants this to happen, she and her fianc\u00e9 need to either figure out a way to do it or ask her mother for help. You are being more than reasonable, if Emily wants more than that, she\u2019s 30 years old and needs to figure it out. She\u2019s also more than old enough to take into consideration the nuance and nature of you and Sam\u2019s relationship. The fact that two separate people won\u2019t help her with this should be a wake-up call to her. Sam has treated two people she loves very badly. She\u2019s allowed to honor and include him in her wedding if she chooses, but she\u2019s not entitled to anyone\u2019s time or money to make it happen.", "NTA.  Have you sat down with her calmly and explained to her all the things he has said and done to you?  It's not a matter of sour grapes on your part, this man actively and purposefully tried to turn your own child against you for his own benefit.  Give specific incidents - take the time before you talk to her to write it all down.  This man's words and actions caused you great harm and absolutely did impact your relationship with YOUR daughter.", "NTA. It's time to sit Emily down and explain everything. She's am adult, and her wishes don't get to overwrite other people's trauma.\n\nSam is homophobic, and has antagonised you for years for the sake of twisting the knife as much as possible. Her step father is an awful human being and honestly it seems he was only good with her to get at you. She may have positive memories of him, but she's the only one, and she's allowed them, but she doesn't get to pretend he wasn't horrific to everyone else.", "My response would be \"I'm not ready to make nice.\" Sam's been an epic dick, there's no way in hell I'd front money or effort to help someone who's treated me like that.\n\nYou may \"nope\" yourself right out of the wedding, but only because you have the self-worth to not allow yourself to be a doormat. The problem lies with Sam, not you, and he needs to make it right. Unable to do that, Emily and her fiance need to understand that one of Emily's \"most special people\" is the asshole who caused the current situation.\n\nNTA", "NTA I think? Part of me says that a couple getting married should be given a lot of leeway to celebrate the day however they like, and the families should set differences aside to make it happen. But reading this I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being unreasonable in saying \u201cI did not have a good relationship with this person, so I don\u2019t want to be a part of honoring them\u201d.  Seems like they should be able to figure out how to do so without your involvement.", "NTA. \n\nIf she wants to honor him have her mom help her.", "NTA. The level of emotional manipulation that Sam has been able to inflict seems to have long stems including into the fiance. \n\nIf Emily is determined to honour Sam then it should be on her own dime and not yours. Fianc\u00e9 is majorly overstepping in terms of emotionally manipulation. Maybe point out, he could finance it himself or do you need to do it because he isn\u2019t even paying for his own wedding?", "She was likely the golden child for Sam and reaped a lot of extra love and time that he wasn't willing to give to Hayes. It was very rude of her fiance to get involved and if it was so important to him, he should find the funds to support her tribute. \n\nFunding a tribute to a person who put you down for years and tried to drive you away from your family is a big no. You might try one more time to explain your reasons, but she likely sees this as her last chance to show him what he means to her. You are both allowed to have your feelings and she needs to grow up and understand a wedding doesn't mean you get to steamroll other people's feelings. NTA", "NTA , It seems really odd Emily would be blissfully unaware of the situation between Sam, Hayes and You for all this time.\n\nSurely as a 30 year old she's financially stable and intelligent enough to pay for something herself ? Also to involve the Fiance was out of line.", "INFO: What is the special tribute she has planned, and why would she come to *you* to finance it? I can see you contributing to any other aspect of the wedding, but why did she come to you for this specific request when she knows how much contention it would inevitably cause?", "NTA. I\u2019m sure she can find a way to honor this guy without dragging you into it. She should respect what you went through.", "NTA but because of this he may get his wish of you not being there.", "NTA.

I get a parent sacrificing their feelings to be the bigger person. But if I was Hayes, having been rejected & ignored by Sam for being gay all these years, I wouldn\u2019t feel great watching my dad honor that guy. If your daughter wants to do this she can do it with her fianc\u00e9 & her mom.", "Sam is/was a freaking sadist. \n\nJust because he is dying, does not mean you have to make nice or play happy families. \n\nYour daughter is asking to much. Do not allow her to emotionally manipulate you into making a decision you are uncomfortable with. She may have loved him, but it is not right or appropriate that she asks this of you. \n\nNeither you nor Hayes have a positive relationship with this man. If she is happy with Sam treating the people she loves badly, well that says more about Emily than anyone else.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Why can\u2019t his wife pay for it? Ridiculous.", "This is a toughie, but I'd say NTA. It sounds as though you were honest with your daughter without being cold or hateful. It is her wedding, sure, but you have a right to respectfully decline just as much as she has the right to ask. The man has tormented you for years while turning around and playing saint to your daughter, which is just gross. It sucks that he's going through something awful, but it doesn't change the years of bad blood.", "NTA. You have every right to refuse to help pay and plan for a way to honor someone who has belittled and mistreated you for years. It's not like you're trying to hijack the wedding demanding for him to not be involved. You simply said you're not wasting your time and money on the man. Emily is an adult. She should be able to understand and handle that.", "NTA.  His decades-long needling and mistreatment of both you and your son has consequences.", "NTA - I she has a mother, her mother can pay for it", "NTA. This man used your kids against you for years and took sadistic pleasure in it.

She can find a way to honor her stepfather that doesn\u2019t involve her bio dad\u2019s time, energy or money. Even if she didn\u2019t know about the taunting, you\u2019d think she realize that your wife left you for him and that it was always going to be a bit of a sore subject. \n\nShe\u2019s welcome to honor him using her own money. Or honor him in a free way\u2014like a dance or toast or something at the wedding.", "NTA, he\u2019s reaping what he sowed.", "NTA and your daughter and her stupid fiance are being amazingly inconsiderate of your feelings and how Sam the Asshole basically taunted you for years.  Well, karma has come home to roost for him and it's time your daughter had this imaginary bubble image of Sam as a nice and good person finally burst.", "Nta if she wants sam in her wedding it okay but she should be one pay for it since it important to her not to you.", "NTA", "Does she not see \u201crelationship\u201d you and Sam have had over the years? If not, maybe you can let her in on it a little. Don\u2019t let it all out, that might not go well. If she did know and asked for your help, then that\u2019s kinda shitty.", "I'm a bit confused as to why you're the one being asked to provide finance and logistics for the step-dad. Does nobody else have any planning skills? On the finance side, surely a tribute doesn't need to be about money? There would be touching ways to do this without a big financial outlay. \n\nHowever, I'm also thinking she's coming to you because you are maybe the most stable and reliable point in her life - in other words a dad. When she's about to lose one of the most valued people in her life she has turned to you for help. You've made your reservations about the guy very clear and everybody will know that, which should reflect well on you if you go ahead and support her in this.", "NTA Your daughter is a grown woman, she can organise and pay herself.

No is a full sentence.\n\nNTA", "NTA, I think you need to sit and have an adult conversation with your daughter about why your relationship is the way it is with Sam and what you saw towards your son. I don\u2019t think you should have to help a man who was tormenting you like a school bully. It\u2019s some sort of karma what happened to him and his health it seems.\n\nA possible compromise could be you give money towards another area of the wedding to free up her money if this is so important she do something as he is important to her so therefore you help her but your money isn\u2019t directly to Sam\u2019s tribute.  I know it still technically means your helping pay for it but if you pay for part of something else you can see it as your real contribution, but please don\u2019t feel guilty for not paying for someone who was rude to you.", "NTA.", "NTA. This man was vile to you and your son for decades.

It's been years but my view ,even now, is he can go fuck himself. Frankly ,he treated you like shit and manipulated the situation to mess with you.

There\u2019s an idea from the Bible of showing favor and grace to people who treat you terribly, \u201cand in doing so heap ashes on their head\u201d. The idea being, if you show them kindness when they know they don\u2019t deserve it, it shames them.\n\nNow, to be clear, fuck that guy and while I also feel a little shameful thinking this, it sounds like he\u2019s getting what he deserves. You might want to consider doing this thing for your daughter but making sure she understands why you don\u2019t want to. In the end, it is her day and she will remember a sacrifice you made for *her* and not *him*.

IT IS A PARENT'S JOB TO SUPPORT THEIR CHILD,** ***PARTICULARLY*** **WHEN THEIR CHILD IS TRYING TO DO SOMETHING KIND AND THOUGHTFUL*****.*** \n\nPut another way: yes, Sam has been shitty to you. We get it. He's your archenemy, your nemesis. All completely valid. He's an AH, without doubt. But in case you hadn't noticed, Sam is dying in one of the most painful, agonizing ways in existence. Motor neuron disease, which you have sort of glossed over here, is a HORRIFIC way to die. Sam is going to die in literal agony, as every individual part of his body shuts down and forgets how to swallow without choking, how to breathe. It's a terrible, painful death. So I think we can be satisfied that if you wanted to get revenge on Sam, the universe has already done that for you better than any minor pettiness around a wedding ever could. \n\nAnd no one is even asking you to empathize with him. Hell, you can go ahead and enjoy his suffering if that's what makes you feel better.\n\nBut you seem to want to lay claim to being a good dad to your daughter, to put paid to Sam's claims that you weren't. And in order to do that, it would be a good start to actually care that  his dying is going to hurt her. And that she wants to make sure while he is still alive that she lets him know that he contributed to her life.\n\nAnd again, yes, we he was a dick to you. BUT THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU, or your relationship with him. It's not even about your son, or their relationship, which you can address separately. This is about your daughter, who is asking you to step up as her dad and help her do something nice on her wedding day for someone she loves . . . and your only reason for saying no is, \"I don't like the guy and he was mean to me.\" I just . . . I can't even begin to imagine my parents saying something like that to me. \"I won't help you because I don't like that person.\" YTA, and I'm sad for you that your ego is more important than your daughter.", "This is a case where I really need to hear the other side of the story. While it\u2019s possible, I doubt that this has been a one sided problem- that Sam, for no reason has launched a years long battle with long and silent suffering OP. More likely OP was rightly wounded by his wife\u2019s betrayal with Sam and fell into an unhealthy pattern of interaction with Sam, who reciprocated poorly. I wish OP was showing as much concern for his daughter\u2019s pain as he is his own.", "[deleted]", "YTA, your daughter thought enough of you that she would even ask.

Listen to HER, not your own ego and delusions of what you think she should feel. To be honest you will drive a wedge between YOU AND HER if you continue down this path in an attempt to show everyone that you can't stand him. No shit, everyone can imagine that based on what he has done in the past. But just because he isn't the best person all the time doesn't mean he deserves to be shit on at every opportunity. **Obviously he has done something right because he has left a positive impression on the star of the show here... your daughter**.

Not if you don\u2019t want.", "YTA\n\nYour contempt for your ex, and Sam, practically oozes out of your post. \n\nSam seems to have been there for your kids, when you weren't.  You say you still had a good relationship with your daughter, so he wasn't getting between the two of you, even if she did also bond with him as a parental figure who was there every day in her life.  I'd be more concerned if she hadn't bonded with Sam, as a person who was in her daily life as she grew up.  You should want her to feel affectionate and comfortable with someone she lives with and interacts with every day.\n\nYou say you think Sam dislikes Hayes for being gay.  But when they were young kids, that wouldn't really have been an issue. And you've given no mention of you being close to Hayes.  There are many reasons why a child and parent or parent figure aren't close.  You \"thinking\" it is because Hayes is gay is not actual evidence that Hayes is treated badly, or that Sam's motivation for treating Hayes badly is because Hayes is gay. \n\nKeeping you informed of their relationship, and how things are going, is not Sam \"taunting\" you.  It is giving you information you need as a parent.  And your jealousy and contempt is palpable enough that I'd call it Sam describing you, not taunting you.

Emily (30f) and Hayes (26m) with my ex-wife. She left me a few months after Hayes was born and ended up getting back together with her high school ex Sam. Sam and my ex ended up marrying seven months later. Emily has always adored Sam. I, however, hate the guy. For years he would work on getting under my skin, saying I wasn't a good enough dad to my daughter because I wasn't enough and she considered him her dad too. He'd tell me every single time she had called him Daddy Sam or Dad Sam. When I told him he was being childish he'd tell me in return that he knew it cut me up inside to have to share her affection as dad. He told me one day he would be walking her down the aisle and maybe she'd even want him to do it alone and would not want me anywhere near them for that.\n\nDespite all this Sam was never able to come between me and Emily and we have always been very close. Sam never cared for Hayes as much. I think Hayes being gay has a large part to play in Sam not caring for him as much as he does Emily.\n\nThere are times I had to restrain myself from exploding in front of the kids when Sam would taunt me. I knew he'd love a chance to get me out of my kids lives.\n\nLast year Sam was diagnosed with motor neuron disease. He's now in a wheelchair and has lost his mobility and his speech has suffered greatly.\n\nEmily is getting married in a few months and wanted us both to bring her down the aisle.\n\nA week ago she came to my house and told me she wanted to pay a special tribute to Sam and she wanted my help to do it (both finance and planning). I told her I would not help her with that. She was upset. Said Hayes refused to help her as well. She told me Sam means a lot to her and she would have thought I would be glad that she had two amazing father figures. I told her Sam and I did not have a positive relationship and there is no way I would ever spend my money or time doing something nice for the man. I told her he had treated me poorly over the years and I accepted she loved him. But he was not worthy of my money or that effort in my eyes. She asked me if I would do it for her. I told her I could not. She said okay.\n\nEmily's fiance called me up after this and said whatever petty issues between Sam and I, could I not do something for my daughter when she's going to lose one of her most special people. He said I was breaking Emily's heart because she doesn't want to be caught between us. That it's clear I am enjoying watching Sam suffer as he is and that's proven by my actions and I'm not being a good dad to Emily.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The really objectionable thing, imo, was letting her dad pay for her whole wedding and then not telling him til the night before that she wanted him to 'co-give her away.'\n\nAlso, I know that Reddit loves to jump to 'villain/hero,' but you've got to remember that OP only knows his own perspective in that story. The sister might tell it differently.\n\nI don't know, I'm with you that aside from the mom and step-dad, I feel horrible for everyone in that story and I hope they all get some type of therapy.", "Why do I feel like the tribute idea was a seed planted by the stepfather?", "There is so much wisdom in your last sentence. \ud83d\udd25", "That\u2019s not a \u201ctribute\u201d to somebody.

I would have popped Sam in the kisser if he said a fraction of those things to me.", "You would've thought that Emily considering Sam a father figure would've been enough for him too though, there was no need for him to twist the knife. Saying that, pettiness is more likely to be caught from OP so best to avoid that and just remain as neutral as possible, Emily will also be affected by the words for far longer", "Right. Finally a story where bad things happens to bad people.", "\"That grandpa is moving pretty slowly, I wonder if he's wearing diapers...\"\n\n<.<", "Ableism isn't okay even if the disabled person is an asshole..

But Reddit has this trope of responding *sEeK tHeRaPy* for every unpleasant emotion someone experiences. It\u2019s dishonest. The *appropriate* emotion to experience after what she did is a period of crushing regret. If she can\u2019t function a year down the line then that\u2019s one thing, but paying someone 125/hour to tell you it\u2019s not your fault and absolve you of the consequences of your choices borders on narcissism.", "A few sheets of plywood solves this.", "These stories are getting more and more fake.  \n\nLast one I called out for being fake was deleted when my comment started getting traction.\n\nThis Reddit is more or less the modern day Jerry Springer.\n\nSomeone just got a tone of likes for a similar bs storey so someone tries a similar one.\n\nEveryone on here is getting trolled big time.", "what\u2019s making you think the post isn\u2019t entirely true? /gen", "I agree with you.

I mean, we're talking about any years here of SD taunting and baiting BD, all the while his daughter has this great relationship and sees him as a second father figure? She really *never* picked up on any of that? And why wouldn't she ask her mom to help her plan something for her SD?! SD also having an issue with the gay son is such a trope, not to mention that it's hard to believe that OP's daughter wouldn't pick up on that since it seems he's out and it's accepted by the rest of the family. \n\nIt seems made up to me, especially with SD conveniently being in a wheelchair now so he *can't* walk her down the aisle. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "And what could the parent do about that?

So fuck the other child? F that. A parent shouldn\u2019t do something that\u2019s purposely going to uplift a bully, bigot, homophobe asshole that mistreated one of their kids just to make the other kid happy.

I really wonder where the mother is in all this and what exactly they are fighting about if nothing is planned yet.\n\nOr maybe  they have exact plans but do not want to tell him? \n\nNevertheless, the only reason I see for OP to get involved in this is that the stepfather is dying, OP soon will be the only father figure anyway (along with maybe being grandfather one day) and he gains absolutely nothing by making his daughter sad on her wedding day. \n\nSo maybe to help would be a good \ninvestment into the future despite despising this man.
