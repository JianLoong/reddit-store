No one wants a man who is not secure in himself. You're gonna have a mix of comments of people saying you should protect his insecurities or his wallet nope. There was no reason for him to offer and embarrass himself and try and turn it on you.", "He obviously feels bad about not having as much money as you or his friends. He needs to work on that. Fortunately it seems the two of you are able to have a somewhat open discussion about it. That bodes well for the future. \n\nYou're not an asshole, but it wouldn't have cost you much to let him save face.

Ben most likely didn't want to look bad to YOUR friends. I'm he probably wants your friends to like him/respect him and got put in a position he wanted to save face/not look broke. Rather than supporting him you intentionally went nah, I'll pay, and didn't give a damn how it made Ben look or feel. \n\nI wanted to be on your side until I read that Ben was invited somewhere by you, that he couldn't afford and with your friends. He is the outsider, he wants to be accepted. You knew that the guys often pay for the girls before the meal and this could be a likely expectation. Don't be surprised if Ben refuses to do anything with your friends again.

He was just trying to provide as most men do. He spoke up because he didn't want to sit while other men paid for his food. \n\nHis actions were actually honorable. \n\nThere are countless stories of women helping the man out in this situation just as a temporary measure to not feel put down.\n\nBottom line He is with you and asked you for a very manageable favor. You could have done it and discussed your displeasure privately. But be honest with yourself, you know why you said no.\n\nIf he could afford it but forgot his wallet would you still say no? Something tells me you said no so others can see either the dynamic of your relationship or you wanted it to be known it was your money. You are no team player, which is one of the best parts of being a spouse.", "NAH. \n\nIt sounds as though you have money. He doesn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t matter to you but it does to him. It might seem odd to you, but for people without money it matters that they don\u2019t have it. Particularly if he likes you and sees you guys going further. \n\nYou need to explain to him that your friends would not see anything off in splitting the bill three ways. That you didn\u2019t emasculate him (assuming you didn\u2019t make it explicitly clear that the table that he couldn\u2019t pay. If you did you are a massive ah). However you don\u2019t want to \u201cfront him\u201d in a money contest with other men - perhaps because you don\u2019t want to have to put your own money up against the boyfriends who sound like they pay easily. So from your point of view it was better everybody paying their own way than you having to pay for him and other people through him. \n\nBut he also needs to understand that you cannot help him be something he is not. And be proud of the fact that you chose him irrespective of your financial situations. I would also suggest that you have a frank talk about how he would prefer to go out- (maybe less fancy places? Maybe just for drinks not dinner etc?) so that he doesn\u2019t continuously feel that he is \u201clesser\u201d than your friends.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The fact that the two guys, according to you, ALWAYS pick up the check, means you were perfectly willing to fall into the stereotypical gender roles previously.

He put you in an impossibly stupid position and you did what you felt was right. But what came after that is what raises concern to me.

Adults talk about money like adults and they do it privately, not with a small group of eyes participating. \n\nIt wasn't a pissing contest. It was awkward because there was no way for him to anticipate how the bill would be divided because you guys didn't talk about it before you went to dinner. Some people pick up the tab for everyone.

I think the OP is an AH because she mistreated her BF and vilified him. She blindly accept her groups tradition of the men paying and did not see the unspoken social rule.

Back when I was making like 35k a year I couldn't afford much. I did put aside $100 or so a month to my girlfriend/date night fund. Well early in the month she was invited to a comedy show. Tickets were like $45, but okay cool, that's only half the budget. Well then it became dinner before and drinks after. The total cost of this night was like $150 each. I picked up an extra shift to cover some of those expenses and a week later my ex got upset I didn't want to go out at with her friends again the following weekend.\n\nI'm sorry, you make nearly double than I make, I can't go out every weekend as much as I enjoyed it. I have a budget for a reason! Needless to say we aren't together anymore.", "I feel the same way. Op says it didn't matter to her. Ben made it apparent that it mattered to him, in this instance. If it really didn't matter to OP she could have just done it out of empathy for Ben's feelings.", "This is exactly what I wanted to say but didn't think I'd have the patience to actually type out. Glad someone covered it. Thank you", "Great response. Notice the OP has ignored this one and not replied as doesn\u2019t fit her narrative.", "agreed, I think the focus has been on the gender dynamic, and not on the class dynamic. It seems like there is a very significant class divide, and OP likely doesn't realize how difficult it is emotionally for her partner to be thrown into this culture difference.", "Completely agree. The OP should have warned Ben about the tradition of the men paying beforehand. He could have made decisions on what to do early on rather than have to figure it out right there and then. OP has zero empathy for Ben. This relationship is not going to last.", "Thanks for typing my thoughts.", "Yeah, unfortunately OP is slightly in the YTA category. The group has established an apparent social norm (i.e. men will pay for nice dinners when the group goes out). Boyfriend wasn\u2019t previously aware of this based on OP\u2019s summary, as he was caught off guard. By paying instead of boyfriend, OP has put boyfriend on lower footing than his peers in the group at a time when he\u2019s presumably working to build those relationships. If the friend group is an important part of OP\u2019s life, and OP anticipates a long term relationship with boyfriend, then this was a disservice to boyfriend and their relationship. Maybe the group doesn\u2019t care, but I would guess that there is a subtle implication there simply by the fact that the rule exists to begin with.\n\n\nAs mentioned in other comments, this is irrespective of the broader societal toxic masculinity issues. This isn\u2019t a situation where boyfriend was proactively trying to look good by paying for the group \u201cas the man\u201d and having OP reimburse him behind the scenes. This is a situation where men paying is \u201ctable stakes\u201d for the group. The norm itself certainly has toxic masculinity implications, but boyfriend\u2019s intent seems to be focused on adhering to the group\u2019s norm and not asserting dominance.\n\nSlightly YTA, because it doesn\u2019t seem like you caught onto that nuance in the moment or compromising (like boyfriend pays, OP reimburses and boyfriend pays her back over time by taking more of the cost of the next few dates).", "Jesus Christ. Always got to go way too far down to find the correct answer.\n\nIt's normal for the 2 guys to pay for the meal. I.e. it's normal for the men to foot the bill. \n\nIt really should be obvious that the bf is feeling insecure because of a social construct that is clearly present. OP made it so much worse by loudly announcing she would pay for 1/3. Why didn't she just hop up and shout \" My BF can't afford this, so I am going to pay instead!\" That's the takeaway. Either that or bf is a cheap jerk. \n\nI'm even going to go so far as to say YTA to op. Why has the whole friend group allowed 2 men to pay for meals for so long? Taking advantage of people because of their gender is not a good thing.", "Fully agree. But I think ESH. OP is not impressed with boyfriend\u2019s gestures, she claims it\u2019s his words that describe her reactions but if that were completely true it would have been properly explained in the original narrative. Wealth privilege is difficult to understand for the common folk and b/f is just trying to fit in it seems and failing in OP\u2019s opinion. These two need to communicate better and it starts with o/p not grandstanding and start taking things private.", "We should normalize wealthier people paying for people of less wealth especially as society becomes more unequal.", "Yeah, I definitely agree.\n\nSocial constructs and expectations put a lot of pressure on people, from beauty to financial stability to gender dynamics.\n\nIn this case, men are seen as the ones who are supposed to pay. So it would be an 'emasculating' feeling to he the only man not paying here. Whether OP of OP's friends care about that or not.\n\nNow, the boyfriend did mention it, but his request was ignored. I think something as 'embarrassing' would be to call out the other men's S.Os to pay the bill instead of the men.

If one of our girl friends brought a guy who didn't pay while all the guys paid, he'd be violating the weird gender roles we had going and been seen as not a good provider for her.

OP's boyfriend shows up and want to appear to continue that tradition and suddenly he is sexist, misogynistic and has outdated views? Seriously? So, all this time Ben and Max, including the women who were OK with that tradition somehow aren't any of those things? This is why some men say women only want special privileges under the pretext of feminism and that they couldn't care less about the essence of feminism and equality. Hypocrisy at its finest.\n\nAlso, I thought women were supposed to be more emotionally intelligent than men?

Why would anyone treat someone they care about this way? I don't understand how the way men make women feel about themselves is such an important thing to some women, yet the moment they get to reciprocate or make their man look good they take that opportunity to either insult him, emasculate him or call him all sorts of things I'm seeing in this thread. What does it cost you to have him pay and zelle him back? Yes, it's an extra step but extra steps are what people do to people they care about. And then everyone is surprised why men don't open up more. When money is in play, it's not that women with money intimidate men. That's just something women say to make themselves feel better.

With that being said, these are \"friends\" of hers, who are subversively pushing the old ideology that a man covers the cost. Instead of just letting him pay now and sending him the money to cover it, what she did was emasculate him in public, and to people who absolutely are judging him and his character.

A next time he is joining anything, people will notice if he DOESN'T show the same behaviour.

YTA if that's the case.", "The sad truth here is that men are often held to social standards around things like being able to pay, it impacts our identity as a man if we feel like we are \"unable to provide\".  It's silly and it should not be the case but sadly gender norms are often so ingrained into our brains at a base level that it is none the less the case.\n\nIn the same way a women might feel entirely responsible for children, even if she has a spouse who does 100% of his share of parenting, the women often feels responsible for parenting particularly in social situations.  Or if a couple is hosing other people for a dinner party, the women often feels a higher level of responsibility for the tidiness of the home or the quality of the food even if her and her partner share those duties equitability. \n\nI learned this lesson during a Christmas Dinner for my family that my GF and I at the time hosted.  It was nothing major but my parents place was going through a reno so we hosted my family at our apartment.  It was not our first time having them over for dinner but THIS was christmas dinner, not a normal dinner.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to it my GF was just going insane.  The decorating, the tidying, the practice cooking.  The stress was causing arguments, it was becoming a problem.  It took me time but eventually we figured out that the reality of the dinner was secondary to how she was feeling about the dinner.\n\nTo her, hosting christmas dinner was a HUGE deal.  Something that her mother (and my mother) took very seriously as the women of the house.  Even though we were sharing the actual work, to her it was an exercise in proving her worth as a wife/mother/women but to me it was just dinner with the parents.\n\nI bring up this example because I want you to imagine yourself in that situation.  You might have a gender balanced relationship but where feelings get involved reality sometimes slides away.  \n\nIn this way, gender norms still impact our thinking and self image in ways that we disagree with on an intellectual level but on a more instinctual level those thoughts are still there.\n\nYour BF wanted to save face in front of the other guys by appearing to be the one who paid. This was not really about you or your relationship but much more about his own insecurities as a man in front of other men.  It doesn't really matter if they were actually judging him or not, what matters is that he was judging himself.\n\nMy mom was not going to start hating my GF if her Christmas Turkey was less than perfect.  Both my GF and mom are modern women and neither really are master cooks.  But the Christmas dinner thing was more about how my GF was feeling about herself than anything our guests would have actually thought. \n\n> This struck me as totally absurd because firstly, it\u2019s an unnecessary step, second even split the cost was something I wasn\u2019t sure he would realistically be able to cover, and third I felt like he was trying to enter a pissing contest with my friends which was just childish.\n\nYou are 100% correct, but I still think it's something that you could have done anyway.  It's not that big a deal, it's not really any additional cost or work and it would have made your BF feel more secure about something that you are already aware that he's insecure about. \n\nTo that end, the ultimate answer here is that you get rid of the insecurity.  To do that is actually deceptively simple.  See he does not actually care about the income difference, this is much more about feelings than it is about income.  \n\nHe wants to feel like you appreciated him as a man and as a provider.  He wants to feel like your friends think he's a good long term partner for you that they're not out there talking behind his back that you should be with someone with more money.  He's insecure, and that's OK.  It's OK to be insecure. \n\nSo instead there's little things that you can do day to day that will kill the insecurity on a long term basis.  Then next dinner it won't matter who pays because he won't be feeling insecure.   And the key is right here..\n\n> Ben and I are from different income brackets, and Ben has expressed that he sometimes feels a little bit weird about this because he is a gentleman at heart but he says it\u2019s hard to treat me since I\u2019m not really impressed by his gestures.\n\nBe impressed by his gestures.  Don't fake what you do not feel, but recognize the sacrifice he makes in doing the gesture even if it's not as large a sacrifice for you. \n\nFor example, you two go out on a night out.  The dinner bill comes and Ben grabs it to pay.  You both know that this dinner is not that special for you, you go to such restaurants all the time.  But Ben paying is a gesture he is making to show you that he cares, take it in the sprit that it's given. You smile, you thank him and you kind of make it a bigger deal than it really is.  Pump up his ego a little bit. \n\nI'd leave you with this analogy.  Not every BJ is the best BJ I've ever recelived.  But you'd never know it from my reactions.  Whenever someone has my dick in their mouth I'll act as if it's the best BJ I've ever received.", "NAH or a very soft ESH. Is Ben caught up the patriarchy and feels emasculated if he can't pay for dinner? Maybe. Could it also be that he is embarrassed about his income, regardless of gender, and didn't want it to be obvious to your friends? Also maybe. Either way, he is clearly embarrassed about his income, for whatever reason. Even it seems unreasonable at the time, you could have let him pay and pay him back, but then sit down with him and have a serious conversation about finances and why he is so self-conscious. It's what a good partner does; have their partners back, even if they are being somewhat (I mean somewhat) unreasonable.", "I am a person who came from little means.

Do you really think this is what Ben signed up for when he agreed to go to dinner with your friends.

Maybe I\u2019m being toxic but there\u2019s no way in fuck I\u2019m letting my gf pay for dinner the first time we go out with a group of her friends. They are judging everything (especially the first meeting). Now, my friends or her friends I\u2019ve come to know well, yea if she picks up the check in that scenario it isn\u2019t a big deal. I\u2019m also lucky enough to make good money. If we go out with her parents I at minimum pay for her and I but offer to pay for the table.

What do men offer in a relationship ?

What reaction is he expecting?\n\nI'm not asking these questions to say you're in the wrong, but sometimes we think we're doing something, but we're only seeing it from our perspective.  I don't really care about receiving gifts.  My wife though LOVES giving gifts.  It's how she expresses her love.  So I quickly realized that I needed to amp up my appreciation for her gifts.  I don't focus on the gift - I focus on the fact that it's an expression of her love and she took the time and effort to do it and to express that love to me.\n\nAlso, your boyfriend is insecure and needs to grow up.  But that's life.  I don't care how old you are, we've all got insecurities that we need to overcome.  You kind of showed total apathy to his insecurity here and sort of put him on blast, from his perspective.  You knew he was insecure about this, but you didn't handle it with tact because you thought his insecurity was stupid.  And personally, I think it is stupid.  But I also get it.  A lot of men define their masculinity in really stupid ways.  Your hope is that he'll continue to grow and mature and overcome that.  Disregarding that insecurity in front of a group of people and making him feel exposed wasn't a very supportive thing to do.\n\nI've been married for 15 years.  My wife has insecurities that I genuinely cannot relate to.  From my perspective, they're every bit as \"stupid\" as your boyfriend's insecurity about the bill here.  But it is what it is.  I love her, and she's doing her best.  We're growing and maturing together.  So I do my best to be cognizant of that and treat her with compassion.\n\nIf you only respect the insecurities that you understand or think are legitimate...you're kinda being a bit selfish.

If OP isnt legally required to do so, OP is NTA, regardless of whether we are dealing with their spouse or a stranger on the street.", "And yet nobody has laid any blame at the women who choose to keep their mouths shut and be paid for.", "This. So much of the reduction in gender roles is like this - not more accepting of men expressing emotion, but more judgemental of women doing so. Not raising boys to be more considerate, raising girls to be less considerate. Eugh.\n\nObviously there are some great improvements, but there is a pattern of just applying toxic masculinity to women more rather than less to men. It makes me want to pull my hair out.\n\nThe money thing is also just our capitalist hellscape of course. Whee.

I suspect she is a lot less innocent in this than she paints herself here. You don't talk about paying before the date and then have it come up as a question at the end, you *just fucking do it*. She didn't. BF is obviously insecure, but I am not so sure that is some inherent behavior of his as it is a result of the relationship dynamics.", "This. I think some of the comments are unfair - OPs friends set the precedent for men providing for women, which sort of reaffirms his insecurities.", "Yea, no way they would act like this. I have to remind myself that a lot of people on the internet but here especially so get to live out there fantasy safely away from reality.", "Yeah, they're all contributing to the gendered expectations that OP's bf had to deal with.", "Oof that's just crazy pathetic. I can feel sympathy for OPs boyfriend because there's a lot of pressure placed on us early on to be seen as a \"provider\". It's ridiculous and not an excuse for his behavior, but it does explain it.\n\nBut to be a lazy bum, a leech, and try to save face?

Why do Max and Harry usually pay? Could it be anything to do with traditional gender roles?\n\nI don't think it's fair of you to spring it on Ben that he was getting treated by the guys (like the rest of the girls). Nor to conform to completely standard social customs but expect Ben to not feel embarrassed when failing to meet those customs. The fact that he had to say something to you before it occurred to you to help split the bill speaks volumes about how little regard you give his anxiety.\n\nNobody, that isn't a freeloader, is comfortable being paid for. Unless: 1. It is clearly agreed upon first. (You implied you'd cover him, then it was Max and Harry).\n2. Everyone is close enough that it goes unsaid. This should be long-term best friends and family territory. (You may feel comfortable with this but are Max, Harry and Ben close close friends? I'm guessing not enough from his reaction).\n3. It's a special treat in their celebration. (Nope)\n4. They can say they will get the next one. (Not a chance. In fact compounded by knowing they will never be able to get any)\n5. It follows social customs. (Ben was put in the recipient position instead of giving, and was powerless to change that)\n\nSo he was deeply uncomfortable. It's all very well to say nobody cares about this stuff. But easier said from a position of comfort. Like telling the one ugly person in a group of otherwise gorgeous friends to not feel insecure. Or like when rich people say \"Money doesn't buy happiness\". It may not but it makes many potential sources of stress and anxiety vanish. Situations like this for Ben being one.", "BINGO.  he wanted the optics of him paying, not the reality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwhich is why he is 100% an insecure moron.", "I totally disagree. If you're out with a mixed gender group of friends, and the guys offer to pay for the girls, as a man you're not *supposed* to say thank you. You're expected to pitch in.

I think it shows lack of character and lack of talent. If you only feel good about yourself because you are wearing a $900 coat and a $6000 watch, then you clearly are of little substance.

And nobody sees the imbalance about this.", "Exactly. The amount of praise OP is getting for knowing that her BF is insecure about not being wealthy and then *choosing to maximize that insecurity in front of her friends*, is insane.\n\nHis perfectly reasonable desire to meet the expectations of the group could've been respected at zero impact to her. But instead, she dumped all over his feelings. And now she's incredulous that he didn't appreciate that.\n\nI don't think OP deserves this guy.

He was invited out to an expensive restaurant where gf knew he wouldn't be able to afford to pay.\n\nHow expensive was this restaurant exactly? My cousin who is a medical specialist who is married to a specialist lawyer is currently in the middle of a million-dollar renovation project and when they invite us to dinner we have to hold cash in reserve because the places she goes are usually upwards of $200/head (and this is when they  limit themselves to \"affordable\" dining because they're aware that the rest of the group are \"poor\" with combined incomes under $500k).\n\nThis is one reason many cultures look down on relationships that cross class divides. A person with $10k discretionary spending just isn't going to pull their weight when involved with a person with $80k discretionary spending. The strain of having to lean on the partner on every occasion that money is involved can rip otherwise healthy relationships apart.\n\n\"Ben\" needs to wise up and accept that he has the luxury of dating a sugarmommy and allow the woman he's romantically involved in to shoulder the burden of the extravagant lifestyle that she's able to live thanks to generational wealth. He should focus on what he does bring to the relationship, not what he doesn't.", "lol too hilarious.", "Being judged by potential romantic partner isn't the only part of what I said.

On both sides as I was comfortable at one point. \n\nSome of my friends are well beyond \"comfortable\". When we went out, I always got the tip. I think they appreciated that more than if I scrounged to pay more than I could afford. \n\nBeing \"comfortable\", I would also offer to pay for my other friends of all financial levels, if they got the tip. One, to pay it forward, I ate some really good food. Two, because I could and it feels nice to be nice.\n\nI am no longer \"comfortable\". My family is fine, wife has a good job, but I'm no longer able to cover the entire bill. Those friends now offer to pay if I get the tip.
