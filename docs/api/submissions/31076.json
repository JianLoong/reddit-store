No one batted an eyelid, but Ben was sulking. \n\nHe\u2019s now mad at me saying I emasculated him and made him look bad in front of my friends.

It would be normal if you all are 80-90 years old.", "NTA  He feels less like a man that's on him. He didn't need to offer. He is trying to make it your issue when it's not. No one wants a man who is not secure in himself. You're gonna have a mix of comments of people saying you should protect his insecurities or his wallet nope. There was no reason for him to offer and embarrass himself and try and turn it on you.", "He obviously feels bad about not having as much money as you or his friends. He needs to work on that. Fortunately it seems the two of you are able to have a somewhat open discussion about it. That bodes well for the future. \n\nYou're not an asshole, but it wouldn't have cost you much to let him save face. He probably feels hurt because your actions made him look bad. \n\nAs always - talking to your partner about these things will likely be more productive for the long term relationship than anything we strangers on the Internet can put forth.", "NAH. You aren\u2019t wrong or an AH for being realistic about the situation but I can absolutely see where he feels emasculated. \n\nHe does need to work on getting over it and get with the times but I can still see why he felt the way he did.", "After reading some of your comments you are 100% TA.\n\nYou invited Ben.\nThey were your friends who clearly have money.\nYou went to a restaurant you knew he couldn't afford.\n\nAt the end of the night a situation arose where Ben felt like he had to pay or at least be seen to pay because of how your friends pay for the girls. Ben most likely didn't want to look bad to YOUR friends. I'm he probably wants your friends to like him/respect him and got put in a position he wanted to save face/not look broke. Rather than supporting him you intentionally went nah, I'll pay, and didn't give a damn how it made Ben look or feel. \n\nI wanted to be on your side until I read that Ben was invited somewhere by you, that he couldn't afford and with your friends. He is the outsider, he wants to be accepted. You knew that the guys often pay for the girls before the meal and this could be a likely expectation. Don't be surprised if Ben refuses to do anything with your friends again. He probably felt set up to a degree. 100% YTA.", "NTA and the moaning about wishing he could treat you and how he can't would be off putting to me aside from the whole \"let me take the credit for paying for something I want you to pay me back for\"", "NTA\nYou didn\u2019t emasculate him.  The situation is what it is and you came by it honestly.  \n\nAlso, he shouldn\u2019t have asked or expected you to lie to your friends.", "YTA. Seems like you wanted to enter the pissing contest. He was just trying to provide as most men do. He spoke up because he didn't want to sit while other men paid for his food. \n\nHis actions were actually honorable. \n\nThere are countless stories of women helping the man out in this situation just as a temporary measure to not feel put down.\n\nBottom line He is with you and asked you for a very manageable favor. You could have done it and discussed your displeasure privately. But be honest with yourself, you know why you said no.\n\nIf he could afford it but forgot his wallet would you still say no? Something tells me you said no so others can see either the dynamic of your relationship or you wanted it to be known it was your money. You are no team player, which is one of the best parts of being a spouse.", "NAH. \n\nIt sounds as though you have money. He doesn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t matter to you but it does to him. It might seem odd to you, but for people without money it matters that they don\u2019t have it. Particularly if he likes you and sees you guys going further. \n\nYou need to explain to him that your friends would not see anything off in splitting the bill three ways. That you didn\u2019t emasculate him (assuming you didn\u2019t make it explicitly clear that the table that he couldn\u2019t pay. If you did you are a massive ah). However you don\u2019t want to \u201cfront him\u201d in a money contest with other men - perhaps because you don\u2019t want to have to put your own money up against the boyfriends who sound like they pay easily. So from your point of view it was better everybody paying their own way than you having to pay for him and other people through him. \n\nBut he also needs to understand that you cannot help him be something he is not. And be proud of the fact that you chose him irrespective of your financial situations. I would also suggest that you have a frank talk about how he would prefer to go out- (maybe less fancy places? Maybe just for drinks not dinner etc?) so that he doesn\u2019t continuously feel that he is \u201clesser\u201d than your friends.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Do we not all know that girls get in free at clubs?", "All my money is someone else\u2019s, I inherited it. \n\nBut I invited him to the dinner knowing I was going to pay for him if we split it. It\u2019s an expensive restaurant that he wouldn\u2019t otherwise choose to go to, and it\u2019s dinner with my friends, I had no issue paying. I just thought it was childish that he wanted to take credit and cause an unnecessary inconvenience for us later because he thought my friend were judging him, which they weren\u2019t", "Well I was going to pay anyway, that\u2019s the point. They just wouldn\u2019t have known about it. And if Ben is more concerned about what my friends think of him than what I think he should ask Max out", "Why are women arseholes when they don\u2019t pander to insecure men, if he couldn\u2019t afford the meal then he shouldn\u2019t have attended.", "Why did no one else speak, including you, when they were talking about the bill being paid? If it didnt bother you to pay, why didnt you say that before this convo with your bf. This feels like you intentionally were embarrassing your bf.", "Yeah, you just don\u2019t get it. YTA.", "your problem is your other friends doing the sexist \"we men will pay for this.\" Perhaps you need to be a bit more attuned to this kind of thing so your friends don't emasculate your bf.\n\nI think your friends are very weird. I might say \"I'll get this\" but I'd never say \"this demographic will get this.\" I kind of feel like your friends might've been deliberately emasculating your bf because \"we men will pay for this meal\" is just weird in any context", "I bet OP invited Ben out for the meal, I mean it was with her friends and everything.", "Because this wasnt a one time thing - with OPs social circle then men normally pay.", "Because when we\u2019re out, the guys at the table often pay the bill, not always but a lot of the time they offer. It doesn\u2019t bother me to pay, but in the moment it wasn\u2019t my first thought. When Ben whispered that he wasn\u2019t okay with it I was like yeah I get that no problem. And then he decided he wanted to pretend to pay. \n\nIf I felt any urge to intentionally embarrass him, I wouldn\u2019t be dating him", "He could still decline the invite or just be happy with his gf paying.", "Maybe the girls pay for takeout or prepare food when they stay in. The guys could earn more or are just being nice. Not everything is a sexist power move.", "So you\u2019re fine with this display of the guys paying normally - and this precedent has been set, in part by you. \n\nSorry but I really can see how Max felt here. You\u2019re mad that he got upset by a standard you helped set.", "I\u2019m fine with them paying, if they\u2019re paying. It\u2019s nice if they do, it\u2019s not a big deal if they don\u2019t. \n\nBut Ben wasn\u2019t going to, he just wanted to look like he was going to. The \u201cstandard\u201d was one he wasn\u2019t adhering to either way (which I didn\u2019t care about), it felt to me like he just wanted to pretend for the benefit of people whose opinions shouldn\u2019t matter to him.", ">it felt to me like he just wanted to pretend for the benefit of people whose opinions shouldn\u2019t matter to him.\n\nsurely Max and Harry's opinions to hold some kind of weight for you. It's very Zen to say \"don't worry about what your girlfriends' friends think of you\" or \"don't worry about what this acquaintance thinks of you\" but it's not very realistic. A billion years of evolution means people do actually care about how others perceive them. \n\nIt's also very easy for you to be Zen about whether or not people think you're broke because you are not broke and never will be broke. Ben's anxieties surrounding wealth and class will be nothing like yours.", "Alright im done after this bc you dont seem to want to understand this. \n\nThese opinions unfortunately *did* matter because that was the tone that was set. Of course he wanted to pretend to keep up with the jones, because thats what ya\u2019ll had always done. You can think these opinions shouldnt matter, but youre not the one worried that people will think you\u2019re less than or poor."]}
