We've been planning this trip since around February before she was even in the picture. We were gonna go roadtrip up to Louisville to go to the Louder than Life music festival (my first concert/festival). It was gonna be me, my brother and my buddy. We book the room in March and we haven't bought the tickets just yet, but we know how much they are gonna be. We had it all budgeted out. It was gonna be 450 per person all said and done. Well cut to a few weeks ago and my friend mentions he's bringing his girlfriend. He doesn't ask or anything he just says \"yeah she's gonna be coming too.\" He also just so happens to call me about on speaker next to her so I look like an asshole if I say anything. The thing is that she just went on a \"girl's trip\" to Florida  that he helped pay for her to go to and wasn't allowed to go himself because \"they made the plans before they were together.\" So what is the difference here? I want to bring this up in a way that doesn't make me seem like a complete asshole but it definitely annoys me. It's not even that it's not a guys trip anymore-- I honestly can't stand his girlfriend and limit interaction with her as much as I can. I wouldn't have even been as mad if he at least gave the choice, but the fact that he just made the executive decision she was coming really pissed me off. Again it's not like we didn't already budget everything out and have our plan together. We're having to pay 75 extra a piece to cover her ticket on top of it. Again just kind of stuck on what I should do, because the whole situation has really just turned me off from going to the festival in the first place.

Not only is it incredibly rude to add another person to the plans without talking to you about it, but the audacity of expecting you to pay MORE for her to come is insanity.
