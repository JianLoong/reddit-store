They just had to suck it up if they wanted to maintain a relationship with him cause he was full on ready to go no contact.\n\nThey ended up being right (my brother has admitted this) because he racked up a bunch of credit card debt to live elsewhere, but at the time he just needed to get out.\n\nYou sound like you're in a stable financial situation and need your own space as your parents aren't respecting your boundaries.

Tell them, how you appreciate the offer, how accepting it in the way they want makes you physically unwell and not accepting it harms you mentaly. How you worry about your fathers health. How you love them. Then offer some alternatives and ask for reasons, when they decline. If they don't offer some, ask to be treated like a human being (not like an adult, but a human, because even/ especially children need reasons).\n\nI'm leaning to NAH, but with a strong tendency towards NTA."]}
