{"id": 24130, "submission_id": "15ktrea", "title": "AITA for telling my daughter she'd have more say in household decisions if she contributed to the rent?", "selftext": "I (48F) have 2 daughters, 22F and 24F. Sara, 24, has a job but lives at home. She pays $500 for rent monthly. 22F, Lily, has autoimmune issues, heart issues, and got a diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome 2 years ago. Lily considers herself disabled, and says her fatigue is too severe to work.\n\nYesterday Lily and I got into an argument about what decisions she gets to make in the household. We recently downgraded to an apartment after her father and I got a divorce.Lily did not get to see the new place before we moved and was with a relative during the moving process, so I decided who got which room. I chose the biggest room. Sara chose the smallest room, but the size difference isn\u2019t huge between the rooms.\n\nLily claimed she wasn\u2019t upset that she did not get the biggest room but was upset that she didn\u2019t get input in the discussion and says she feels like she doesn\u2019t have any say in the decisions of the house, or any personal space. She cited an example of a few days ago when she took the car keys in after a doctor\u2019s appointment, and I walked into the bathroom while she was in it to ask for the keys. She asked if she could finish but I told her I needed the keys right then to see a friend. She felt it was \u201cinappropriate that her personal space was intruded upon\u201d and I came in without knocking.\n\nShe comes into my room without knocking to ask me questions, so I do not see how it was a big deal. I also told her simply, I get the biggest room and I get to decide who gets what in this house because I am the mother. I then asked Lily since she doesn\u2019t contribute rent to the household, what exactly does she contribute? She listed simple chores and tasks she does that were basic tasks an 11-year-old could do. She claimed because of her chronic illnesses it is hard for her to do much and she gets very fatigued very easily.\n\nI told her if she contributed rent money she would have more power in family decision making. Lily started crying and said she is currently trying to get disability, but that it is a long process. She also said I was being unfair because I know she has been feeling worse the past two months or so. (She has lost 12 lbs, hasn\u2019t had an appetite, and has been sleeping 12-20 hours a day.) I told her I understand it\u2019s hard that she currently can\u2019t contribute money, but that\u2019s just the reality of it. She pressed to still be included in household decisions, and I asked her if she really thought we were equals. She said yes, which was surprising to me. I am the adult of the household and sole provider. My child is my child, but I do not view her as an equal.\n\nLater, Sara told me that Lily had a conversation with their father (my ex-husband) and he called me an AH. I\u2019ve told Lily multiple times in the past that if she is so unhappy here she is free to live with him, but she claims she cannot because he has moved across the country and she doesn\u2019t want to leave her team of doctors here.\n\nAm I the AH in this matter?", "created_utc": 1691434995, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ktrea/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_shed_have_more_say/", "score": 1234, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She 100% has a disability that is preventing her from being contributing. As some one who struggles with chronic fatigue it is really hard for people to understand how debilitating it can be. You like a mountain of bricks is on top of you, and staying awake is torture so doing anything is difficult including those little tasks that you claim an 11 can do. It might not be a big deal to you, but it is for her. So many people just assume you are lazy, and it is really hard to not feel like that. Even finding a good doctor who believes you is difficult, and when you do it takes a while to find a treatment that is effective(which is why she is stuck where she is. Moving means starting from scratch). \n2) yes ok some things you do get to decide because you are the one paying the bills, but that doesn\u2019t mean your daughter shouldn\u2019t get a say in anything at all. \nShe 100% should have a say about her privacy (you entering the bathroom while she is using it), and other small things like about how her things are being used, how she is being treated.

If she gets approved for disability, whatever contribution she could make from her benefits would be much appreciated and I would feel more inclined to include her in household decisions. I understand completely that she wants to be an autonomous adult but she is not self-sufficient right now. \n\nI'm not sure if she's depressed or if these new symptoms are related to her health issues. She has been on anti-anxiety mediciation since she was 13. Her doctors seemed concerned hearing what's been going on with her at our recent appointment and ordered a bunch of blood tests and other testing, and I think their reaction scared Lily. She keeps saying if it's something bad, like cancer, that she doesn't want treatment and wants to move out to California to just be with her dad. That hurt me. So I know she doesn't really want to live with me either, she's just living with me because it's close to her current medical team, her friends, and her girlfriend. I think living with her father would make her happier. She stayed with him for two weeks before he moved across the country and our relationship during that time was much more pleasant.", "Yeah, and simply agreeing to not just barge in the bathroom without knocking when someone is using it?

She may not be able to live on her own. She struggles a lot with daily tasks. Yes, she takes out the trash and does the laundry when she can, but she will get winded quite easily from cleaning or moving objects, her heart races, she gets visibly and audibly out of breath. Not gasping for air, but her breathing gets labored. This is because she also has bronchiectasis (lung wall widening) due to her being immunocomprised. I would have included all this in the post to specify her issues if the character limit would have allowed. So she may need help from other people for the rest of her life, but living with a roommate, friend, or her current partner would be fine for her. She has talked about living with her girlfriend before but it is not feasible for them until she gets approved disability and is able to pay her share of rent. \n3. I suspect if I suddenly could not take care of her tomorrow, she would move out to be with her dad. She feels he understands her more because he is disabled as well.

I have read a lot of them and reflected on them tonight and feel that having a conversation with Lily about her autonomy and support in this house and family is much needed. I have read a lot of what people have been saying about chronic illness and chronic fatigue syndrome in particular, and want to learn more. There are very limited resources and it is not very well-known, I had never heard of it before Lily was diagnosed. I also want to apologize to her about the bathroom incident. We have lived in houses that mainly have one bathroom for Sara and Lily's whole life, so it was normal for people to be in and out at different times. I understand now she is 22 and suffering from GI symptoms post-surgery she may not feel the same way.\n\nI think the confusion on the \"equals\" comment I made that some people are questioning came from our different understanding of my words. I meant, \"do you view us as equals in that we both equally care for and contribute to the household?\" She might have seen this as, \"do you view us as equals in that we are both worth the same as people?\" I am not sure but regret not making my wording clearer to her.\n\nOne thing I will say is that no, we do not own our current apartment. I pay rent as does Sara. I probably should've mentioned this in the original post, but I was almost exceeding the character limit already. We did not own the house we moved from, either. We live in an area where cost of living is extremely high and despite saving for years, I have accepted the fact that after the cost of the divorce (which was within the past 3 years) and the distribution of much of my money to my ex-husband, I will most likely never buy a house of my own. Part of the reason Sara is contributing to rent is that she understands the financial stress the divorce has had on me and how much more careful we have to be money now. Lily understands this too, which is why I think she got so emotional when I asked what she contributed to our household.\n\nI never wanted to make her feel bad about not contributing, which a lot of the comments are thinking was my intention. I simply wanted to say: this is how things go when you cannot contribute (even if you are physically unable to). I am still the mother to my children. I am aware they're adults, and they do deserve their own autonomy.

There's no bonuses or anything based on how many people you deny. There is absolutely no benefit try and deny anyone. And it honestly tends to be more work to try and deny people, if you're not denying them for non-compliance.\n\nI approved many claims on the time, though I ended up denying quite a few as well. I did keep track of every single claim that went I approved on the first application to see if they got picked up by QA at the level, and every single one did - and my decisions were signed off on by the feds as well. I also took a lot of time to write extremely, overly detailed reasonings as to exactly why I was making the determination I was so that the doctor who would sign off on the claim - and the QA reviewer - would understand the reasoning. While it took me a lot of time to write up those decisions, my reasoning were air tight and I never had those decisions come back to me and folks got their money.\n\nAnd no, you don't have to be dying to get disability. Some of the conditions included in my \"approved on the first applications\" greatest hits included migraines, schizophrenia, autism, intellectual disability, heart failure, transplants, HIV, amputations, depression, personality disorder, liver failure, transplants, kidney failure, seizures, asthma, and eating disorder. None of these people were actively dying. If you can meet a Blue Book listing, you're golden. If you can get close enough that your examiner can argue that while your condition doesn't meet the listing, but can \"equal\" the listing, still golden.", "Yes, a Dr has to say so in order to get SSDI. But \"has not gone through the abusively complex process to legally get SSDI\" is NOT the same as \"not disabled\". People don't have to be legally declared disabled for it to be too hard to hold down paid employment. Our SSDI system is ableist bs that hasn't been updated since the 60s", "Op specifically mentioned her daughter has chronic fatigue syndrome. \n\nYou clearly know absolutely Jack shit about that.", "People should not be forced into labor that could make their issues worse just because they technically can do it. You have no idea what OP\u2019s daughter can handle doing. Also, there are ways to be \u201cproductive\u201d other than work.", "> read a book [about chronic fatigue syndrome] \n\nNo. I don\u2019t care enough, and I don\u2019t need to. She is not comatose, she can find *some* way to positively contribute to her household. She can take care of the vast bulk housework - it is an apartment, not a mansion - or work with a doctor to ameliorate whatever symptoms that she can, and get a part time job. She can, at minimum, not act like she is entitled to the biggest space. The harsh reality is that Lily is **not** an equal with OP, here. \n- if Sara were not there, there may or may not be more of a financial drain. \n- if OP were not there, neither sister would have a roof over their head, or food on the table. \n- if lily were not living with them, the other two would have to do a bit more in the way of chores. \n\nWhich of those people is the lynchpin of the household?\n\nThe world does not revolve around empathy-driven decision making. Maybe sad, but not realistic.", "She doesn't want to \"take priority\". She just wants to be treated like a human being.", "That bugged me too.\n\nThe bathroom is not the same as bedroom(invasion-wise for questions)\n\nNor is going to OP's friend's house important enough not to wait a few minutes, knock on door, etc.\n\nAnd not wanting to leave her doctors and start the process ALL over again somewhere else is REASONABLE(where she'll need to find a GP then have GP refer her to all the doctors she needs to see, then to get them scheduled for first Chat appt, then TESTS up the WHAZOO then get actual treatment).\n\nPlus Daughter will be dealing with a whole new State's disability office(across the country).\n\nIf OP keeps this up, daughter **will** move and then she'll make a MISSING REASONS post.  *Why doesn't my daughter ever visit me*???????", "Don\u2019t take someone else\u2019s keys and forget to return them if you want your privacy.", "Is it really, really necessary to be so nasty about another persons opinions?  We all have a right to give our opinion on AITA.  In fact, I'm pretty sure the people posting are looking for a variety of opinions.   I said nothing nasty or mean about OP or her daughter.   I gave my opinion and tried to comment on OP's post with my take on it and thinking of it from various angles.  The fact that you have to be nasty, is something about you, not me.     \nHaving said that, you do actually know that there are computer jobs that people can do online from home, right?   And you do know that many people with various disabilities do, indeed, work, right?   Again, we all have a right to our opinions.  You do not need to agree, but you also don't need to be disrespectful, either.", "you're a bad person, and you should feel bad.", "It's appalling that so many people (including the us gov) only think about disability in terms of \"can they sell their labor to others for money?\" Human beings have worth, value and dignity without paid employment"]}
