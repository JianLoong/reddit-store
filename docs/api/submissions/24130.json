{"id": 24130, "submission_id": "15ktrea", "title": "AITA for telling my daughter she'd have more say in household decisions if she contributed to the rent?", "selftext": "I (48F) have 2 daughters, 22F and 24F. Sara, 24, has a job but lives at home. She pays $500 for rent monthly. 22F, Lily, has autoimmune issues, heart issues, and got a diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome 2 years ago. Lily considers herself disabled, and says her fatigue is too severe to work.\n\nYesterday Lily and I got into an argument about what decisions she gets to make in the household. We recently downgraded to an apartment after her father and I got a divorce.Lily did not get to see the new place before we moved and was with a relative during the moving process, so I decided who got which room. I chose the biggest room. Sara chose the smallest room, but the size difference isn\u2019t huge between the rooms.\n\nLily claimed she wasn\u2019t upset that she did not get the biggest room but was upset that she didn\u2019t get input in the discussion and says she feels like she doesn\u2019t have any say in the decisions of the house, or any personal space. She cited an example of a few days ago when she took the car keys in after a doctor\u2019s appointment, and I walked into the bathroom while she was in it to ask for the keys. She asked if she could finish but I told her I needed the keys right then to see a friend. She felt it was \u201cinappropriate that her personal space was intruded upon\u201d and I came in without knocking.\n\nShe comes into my room without knocking to ask me questions, so I do not see how it was a big deal. I also told her simply, I get the biggest room and I get to decide who gets what in this house because I am the mother. I then asked Lily since she doesn\u2019t contribute rent to the household, what exactly does she contribute? She listed simple chores and tasks she does that were basic tasks an 11-year-old could do. She claimed because of her chronic illnesses it is hard for her to do much and she gets very fatigued very easily.\n\nI told her if she contributed rent money she would have more power in family decision making. Lily started crying and said she is currently trying to get disability, but that it is a long process. She also said I was being unfair because I know she has been feeling worse the past two months or so. (She has lost 12 lbs, hasn\u2019t had an appetite, and has been sleeping 12-20 hours a day.) I told her I understand it\u2019s hard that she currently can\u2019t contribute money, but that\u2019s just the reality of it. She pressed to still be included in household decisions, and I asked her if she really thought we were equals. She said yes, which was surprising to me. I am the adult of the household and sole provider. My child is my child, but I do not view her as an equal.\n\nLater, Sara told me that Lily had a conversation with their father (my ex-husband) and he called me an AH. I\u2019ve told Lily multiple times in the past that if she is so unhappy here she is free to live with him, but she claims she cannot because he has moved across the country and she doesn\u2019t want to leave her team of doctors here.\n\nAm I the AH in this matter?", "created_utc": 1691434995, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ktrea/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_shed_have_more_say/", "score": 209, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She 100% has a disability that is preventing her from being contributing. As some one who struggles with chronic fatigue it is really hard for people to understand how debilitating it can be. You like a mountain of bricks is on top of you, and staying awake is torture so doing anything is difficult including those little tasks that you claim an 11 can do. It might not be a big deal to you, but it is for her. So many people just assume you are lazy, and it is really hard to not feel like that. Even finding a good doctor who believes you is difficult, and when you do it takes a while to find a treatment that is effective(which is why she is stuck where she is. Moving means starting from scratch). \n2) yes ok some things you do get to decide because you are the one paying the bills, but that doesn\u2019t mean your daughter shouldn\u2019t get a say in anything at all. \nShe 100% should have a say about her privacy (you entering the bathroom while she is using it), and other small things like about how her things are being used, how she is being treated.

As a member of the household, she deserves a voice that should be considered, if not a full vote.  I don't think your room assignment strategy was inappropriate.

She has been on anti-anxiety mediciation since she was 13. Her doctors seemed concerned hearing what's been going on with her at our recent appointment and ordered a bunch of blood tests and other testing, and I think their reaction scared Lily. She keeps saying if it's something bad, like cancer, that she doesn't want treatment and wants to move out to California to just be with her dad. That hurt me. So I know she doesn't really want to live with me either, she's just living with me because it's close to her current medical team, her friends, and her girlfriend.
