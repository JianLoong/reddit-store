{"id": 24130, "submission_id": "15ktrea", "title": "AITA for telling my daughter she'd have more say in household decisions if she contributed to the rent?", "selftext": "I (48F) have 2 daughters, 22F and 24F. Sara, 24, has a job but lives at home. She pays $500 for rent monthly. 22F, Lily, has autoimmune issues, heart issues, and got a diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome 2 years ago. Lily considers herself disabled, and says her fatigue is too severe to work.\n\nYesterday Lily and I got into an argument about what decisions she gets to make in the household. We recently downgraded to an apartment after her father and I got a divorce.Lily did not get to see the new place before we moved and was with a relative during the moving process, so I decided who got which room. I chose the biggest room. Sara chose the smallest room, but the size difference isn\u2019t huge between the rooms.\n\nLily claimed she wasn\u2019t upset that she did not get the biggest room but was upset that she didn\u2019t get input in the discussion and says she feels like she doesn\u2019t have any say in the decisions of the house, or any personal space. She cited an example of a few days ago when she took the car keys in after a doctor\u2019s appointment, and I walked into the bathroom while she was in it to ask for the keys. She asked if she could finish but I told her I needed the keys right then to see a friend. She felt it was \u201cinappropriate that her personal space was intruded upon\u201d and I came in without knocking.\n\nShe comes into my room without knocking to ask me questions, so I do not see how it was a big deal. I also told her simply, I get the biggest room and I get to decide who gets what in this house because I am the mother. I then asked Lily since she doesn\u2019t contribute rent to the household, what exactly does she contribute? She listed simple chores and tasks she does that were basic tasks an 11-year-old could do. She claimed because of her chronic illnesses it is hard for her to do much and she gets very fatigued very easily.\n\nI told her if she contributed rent money she would have more power in family decision making. Lily started crying and said she is currently trying to get disability, but that it is a long process. She also said I was being unfair because I know she has been feeling worse the past two months or so. (She has lost 12 lbs, hasn\u2019t had an appetite, and has been sleeping 12-20 hours a day.) I told her I understand it\u2019s hard that she currently can\u2019t contribute money, but that\u2019s just the reality of it. She pressed to still be included in household decisions, and I asked her if she really thought we were equals. She said yes, which was surprising to me. I am the adult of the household and sole provider. My child is my child, but I do not view her as an equal.\n\nLater, Sara told me that Lily had a conversation with their father (my ex-husband) and he called me an AH. I\u2019ve told Lily multiple times in the past that if she is so unhappy here she is free to live with him, but she claims she cannot because he has moved across the country and she doesn\u2019t want to leave her team of doctors here.\n\nAm I the AH in this matter?", "created_utc": 1691434995, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ktrea/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_shed_have_more_say/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She 100% has a disability that is preventing her from being contributing. As some one who struggles with chronic fatigue it is really hard for people to understand how debilitating it can be. You like a mountain of bricks is on top of you, and staying awake is torture so doing anything is difficult including those little tasks that you claim an 11 can do. It might not be a big deal to you, but it is for her. So many people just assume you are lazy, and it is really hard to not feel like that. Even finding a good doctor who believes you is difficult, and when you do it takes a while to find a treatment that is effective(which is why she is stuck where she is. Moving means starting from scratch). \n2) yes ok some things you do get to decide because you are the one paying the bills, but that doesn\u2019t mean your daughter shouldn\u2019t get a say in anything at all. \nShe 100% should have a say about her privacy (you entering the bathroom while she is using it), and other small things like about how her things are being used, how she is being treated.

I want nothing more than for her to be healthy. I don't resent her. I resent the way she talks to me as if our position in the household is the same.", "I would love if Lily got a job, but I understand it's not possible for her right now. I do see her day-to-day life and feel terrible that she's had to struggle with these conditions for so long now. We've been working with her doctors for so long to try and figure out how to best help her. If she gets approved for disability, whatever contribution she could make from her benefits would be much appreciated and I would feel more inclined to include her in household decisions. I understand completely that she wants to be an autonomous adult but she is not self-sufficient right now. \n\nI'm not sure if she's depressed or if these new symptoms are related to her health issues. She has been on anti-anxiety mediciation since she was 13. Her doctors seemed concerned hearing what's been going on with her at our recent appointment and ordered a bunch of blood tests and other testing, and I think their reaction scared Lily. She keeps saying if it's something bad, like cancer, that she doesn't want treatment and wants to move out to California to just be with her dad. That hurt me. So I know she doesn't really want to live with me either, she's just living with me because it's close to her current medical team, her friends, and her girlfriend. I think living with her father would make her happier. She stayed with him for two weeks before he moved across the country and our relationship during that time was much more pleasant.", "Yeah, and simply agreeing to not just barge in the bathroom without knocking when someone is using it? That's just decency and respect.", "Would you feel the same way if she was treating her sister like that? If the situation became Lily living with her sister and her sister financially supporting her, would it be fair for Lily to demand to be equal in the household? The bathroom thing is not cool but her mother also says that Lily barges into her room without knocking. I\u2019m genuinely curious because that\u2019s something that crossed my mind too. If I were in that situation with my sister, how I would feel if they wanted that.", "Thank you. This is how I see it. I've asked her before what she is going to do if I choose to retire early and can no longer support her. She doesn't really have a plan for her future.", "It takes multiple applications and rejection to get disability benefits. Lily has multiple health problems and isn't in a position to work", "Disabilities are different, the fact you manage to work doesn't mean she can", "Did you even read the post?", "1. Lily does not currently receive disability. She was denied once, and is applying for a second time with the help of a pro-bono lawyer. If she is granted disability, he will get a share of that for the time he has taken to help her. If she is denied again, he will get nothing and his work will have been free. \n2. She may not be able to live on her own. She struggles a lot with daily tasks. Yes, she takes out the trash and does the laundry when she can, but she will get winded quite easily from cleaning or moving objects, her heart races, she gets visibly and audibly out of breath. Not gasping for air, but her breathing gets labored. This is because she also has bronchiectasis (lung wall widening) due to her being immunocomprised. I would have included all this in the post to specify her issues if the character limit would have allowed. So she may need help from other people for the rest of her life, but living with a roommate, friend, or her current partner would be fine for her. She has talked about living with her girlfriend before but it is not feasible for them until she gets approved disability and is able to pay her share of rent. \n3. I suspect if I suddenly could not take care of her tomorrow, she would move out to be with her dad. She feels he understands her more because he is disabled as well. He has been on a comfortable amount of SSI since 2006 due to his past occupation as a lawyer after contracting a neurodegenerative disease, so he could certainly take care of her just as well as I can.", "Couldn't you have just knocked on the door and spoken to her through the door about the keys? \"Hey, I really need the keys, can you hop up and hand them to me as soon as it's possible?\" \n\nThat's just basic respect.", "Oh, in that case, barge right in. YTA.", "That\u2019s even worse for gods sake!", "Holy shit.  You were an asshole before but youre an even bigger asshole for this", "So now were learning stomach surgery, yep your daughters with all these issues should def be working not calling herself disabled and paying you rent/S\n\nThis fairy story you navigate are you the evil mother!!", "This isn't how SSDI/SSI works", "This is true. While I'd love for Lily to have disability benefits, because they would give her a sense of financial independence and autonomy, in reapplying again for disability, she will most likely have to get a functional capacity evaluation in order to prove her unable to work. I also did not mean I did not view her as disabled, I just did not want to label her that outright in case some found it offensive.\n\nAnd you're 100% right, most diagnoses do not automatically qualify you. My ex-husband was misdiagnosed with ALS after contracting a neurodegenerative disease back in 2006, was told at first he had 6 years to live, and still had to go to court to get disability. It was a long and excruciating fight, and I hate that Lily has to go through it as well.", "You're dismissive of her disabilities in every word and dismissive of her as an adult human because you find her of low value since you feel she doesn't \"contribute\". She'd be better off if you just threw her out! Then, she'd atleast immediately qualify for assistance and live away from your constant belittling and negatively. \nWalking in on someone on the toilet and making demands is the ultimate show of your disrespect of her.", "She may never be healthy. You should still treat her with dignity and respect. She is still a human being, same as you and your preferred daughter... and not seeing that that makes you the huge AH.", "> as she feels unsafe driving not knowing when her heart could start beating abnormally\n\nYou need to ask a doctor, but it may illegal for her to drive (if you're in the US.)   \n\n\nIf you have a condition that affects your heart, or causes you to go unconscious, you're not legally allowed to drive for 6 months in the US, and if she had an event where someone was hurt, she would be legally liable, or you would for letting her drive depending.", "Thanks for clarifying. NAH.\n\nYour daughter is getting older, many of her peers are beginning adulthood and figuring things out for themselves. Because of her health problems, she is not at this state of life, and is probably resentful and eager to grab onto any autonomy she can claim.\n\nOf course, you're right in that she's not a self-sufficient adult, or even someone that contributes to the household at all. Still, if you love her as a daughter, it may be worthwhile to try and find middle ground. If she wants more say, then delegate her more responsibilities. If she refuses to do anything, then you'll still not be an ass.", ">I know she doesn't really want to live with me\n\nWell yeah, with how ableist you are, I wouldn't either.", "Why would she want to live with you when you treat her so badly?", "I don\u2019t know about, you but I don\u2019t sit on the loo, and open my bowls, in my bedroom. Nor do I still use the \u201cthey did it first\u201d excuse to justify my own poor behaviour.", "The bathroom thing is gross though. She could have been on the toilet. \n\nIt's your house and you call the shots. Fortunately it doesn't sound like you're making Lilly live in squalor. That said, please don't make Lilly feel like a burden because of her disability. Show her sympathy and kindness. Let her pick a family dinner to eat once a week. At least let her have the freedom to make those kinds of decisions.", "Of course she doesn't have a plan, she's not approved for disability and can't apply for Section 8 housing until she is, if the list opens.", "You brought her into this world. She didn\u2019t ask for this existence. Sometimes people with disabilities require help from their parents far longer than those without. The way you treat her is dehumanizing and lacks an ounce of empathy. Furthermore, you said she\u2019s working on getting disability so cut her some slack.", "Yes, it is. It's more complicated definitely, but in the end, many diagnosis require a doctor to sign off that you meet the qualifying factors and simply having a disorder/disease/condition doesn't make it automatic. There are some diagnosis that automatically qualify you, but most do not.", "She doesn\u2019t seem to have any plan but to live with her mother for the rest of her life though\u2026.\n\nTo be fair, no one asked to be in existence. Besides the not knocking (but her daughter barges into her room too), I think her mother isn\u2019t dehumanizing her. She has a place to live, food to eat, and is living life. The only thing she is \u201cdepriving\u201d her of is having the equal power in the household. Unless the home is under your name or you are paying for it, I think it\u2019s fair that her mother makes the decisions.\n\nIf she\u2019s unhappy with being treated as a kid, she needs to leave or start making plans to support herself. She\u2019s still living with her mother but expects to be treated equal as her mother? Crazy", "It's way more than a \"doctor signing off\" lol. If that's it, then why are there law firms that help people navigate the social security administration? Why did the TANF office in a nearby county where I live have employ someone at the local SSA because people were getting denied when they shouldn't have been?", "Some people literally cannot work but she\u2019s working on getting disability. She deserves to be treated as an adult.", "As I said, it's way more complicated, but nothing you've said negates the medical team involvement or my actual point, that I think the women (who I said was an asshole) meant her daughter wasn't receiving any disability.", "What if the situation was that she was living with her sister and her sisters family rent free but had the expectation that she was equal in decision making?", "I guess if you ignore all nuance", "That isn\u2019t the situation"]}
