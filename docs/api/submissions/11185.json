I used to think that of course he would be in the delivery room with me. However, I\u2019m a idealistic person with very specific and high expectations that I\u2019m thinking he wouldn\u2019t be able to live up to in this situation. \n\nTo start, when my husband and I were in college years ago, we were watching the show Mad Men (show that takes place in the 60s), the episode were Betty has a baby and her husband Don waits outside for it to be born. I was horrified and just couldn\u2019t get over how that used to be normal. It didn\u2019t even seem like the husband in the show was concerned about his wife at all while he was waiting. My husband didn\u2019t understand what the big deal was and said that his own dad wasn\u2019t present at his birth and that\u2019s normal where he\u2019s from (I\u2019m from the US and he\u2019s from a different country). He also said that his mom said it didn\u2019t even hurt that bad (which is awesome for her but I just know I\u2019m going to have vastly different feelings about it for me). \n\nI see so many posts on here about husbands who admire and respect their wife so much after being present for the birth, and are just so grateful to have gotten to witness something so amazing, and many as well about husbands who worry so much about their wives in labor and dote on them, feeling terrible for them that they are in so much pain and struggling. If I were the partner not giving birth, I know I would have all of these feelings. I just don\u2019t think my husband would feel these ways. \n\nHere\u2019s where I think I\u2019m the asshole. My husband said he wants to be there for the birth, and I think he would truly be sad to be uninvited. \n\nThat being said, this is going to be one of the hardest things I ever do, I\u2019m going to be very vulnerable, and for selfish reasons I think I\u2019ll just feel sad to have someone with me who won\u2019t see this as an absolutely insane, incredible and trying experience, and instead sees it as something cool to be a part of but not that big of a deal not to be a part of, if that makes sense. I just always imagined my husband feeling a similar way about birth to me, and me coming to terms with the fact that he doesn\u2019t, makes me just want to have this experience alone (well, with my doula who I specifically chose because we have similar views on birth). \n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not angry at my husband for having a different view, I just feel like this is the one situation I should get to be selfish and do what makes me comfortable. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1677653714, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ewxlk/wibta_if_i_uninvited_my_husband_from_our/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can say with a fair amount of confidence that most guys go into the birthing experience with a VERY different attitude than they leave with. Most people just aren't that good at imagining a situation - they don't know what's coming until they're in the middle of it. I can understand wanting to have a doula there but I don't understand wanting to shut your husband out. \n\n>I\u2019m a idealistic person with very specific and high expectations\n\nThis approach could really set you up for some challenges. Do you have a counselor to work with?  One thing about birthing and parenting that's almost universally true is that it's a massive exercise in learning to let go of your expectations for control. You can prepare and communicate but you ultimately can't control how your birth experience will go and you definitely can't control who your children will become. If you've had a history of needing a high level of control over your environment and your relationships, I would get a family therapist lines up to support you through this transition.", "YTA if you don\u2019t have a conversation with him about why you feel this way, but may or may not BTA for uninviting him based on his response.", "ESH. You\u2019re about to be parents, TALK TO EACH OTHER FFS. I\u2019m 34 weeks pregnant with my second baby and if I had a concern like this, I\u2019d talk to the father of my daughters. I\u2019m 23 and was raised with poor communication skills myself (abusive parents, addict mother). \n\nHe\u2019s not obligated to feel the same way as you about the birth of your child. He\u2019ll never give birth, he doesn\u2019t understand how traumatic it can be. \n\nI tore badly vaginally with my first born, nearly needed a c-section and had issues breathing, good for his mom that it \u201cwasn\u2019t that hard\u201d for her but that\u2019s definitely not the case for every birth. \n\nSit down, talk, and you should honestly think about how great it is he wants to be present when it\u2019s not common in his home country. He wants to be there to meet your baby and that should be plenty. \n\nIf you need someone to be just as worried about you, bring a second support person, your mother would be a great choice if she doesn\u2019t suck.", "You would be TAH if you didn't have a very specific conversation with him and explained how you feel about all of this. Specifically about him not being there and the feelings that this situation could invoke. The end choice is yours, but by not having this discussion with him, were you give him free reign to talk about the things that he's feeling about this, and not accusing him of what you believe he feels about this, you could be robbing both of you of this wonderful experience. You obviously want him to feel a certain way, and it sounds like he didn't know that that was a way to feel, his background and culture didn't give him this viewpoint. Please have the conversation before you uninvite him.", "YWBTA.\n\nYou're correct, giving birth isn't a spectator sport. However this is the father of the baby and your husband not some random off the street.\n\nTalk to him. Express your concerns. Give him the opportunity to express how he feels too.\n\nOf course your comfort is most important, but you can't ignore the fact whatever decision you make will impact your relationship and family going forward.   So it doesn't matter what a thousand strangers on the Internet think, will this decision negatively affect your marriage going forward (and believe me the weeks and months after giving birth can be an emotional minefield at the best of times!)", "INFO\n\nAre holding against your husband a conversation you had back in college years ago.\n\nOne think I'd say is how are you going at the moment.  I ask because I had pre natal depression and was hormonally a mess in the weeks leading up to birth.  It caused me to make some wonky decisions that looking back on I can see where they came from but I regret them.  I wouldn't want you to have that.  \n\nLook yes, your body and it is your choice but you also have to understand that with those choices come consequences that you will have to live with.  Will you regret it? Will you really need him there to support you? Is his current way of reaction his way of processing things at the moment.", "I\u2019m going to go with ESH here because you two aren\u2019t talking to each other. If you can\u2019t properly communicate now, how the hell are you going to do it once the baby arrives? \n\nEvery person who births a child has a different experience; even those who have more than one themselves. \n\nTalk to each other, FFS, but also understand that whatever expectation either of you have may not be 100% realistic. Things happen during the birthing process and some can get quite upset that things didn\u2019t go to plan. \n\nThe baby doesn\u2019t know nor care about said plans. What will happen, will happen.", "YTA!\n\nMost guys have no idea what childbirth is like.  And if you keep him out, he still won't have any ideas.  I started getting some idea during the birthing classes.  And then I got some idea when I saw her go through the first contractions. And then I had a whole lotta idea when my otherwise really calm wife looked at me and said \"Will you stop with the stupid breathing exercises?!?\"  And the look on her face was clear that it was a life or death decision on my part. (So much for those birthing classes.)\n\nMy point is that he WANTS to be there.  So what if he has no idea what it's actually going to be like.  He's going to learn right after that first contraction, exactly how \"absolutely insane, incredible and trying experience\" it is.  If he's a loving husband that's shown the ability to be empathetic and learn, and if he's someone you do normally count on for support, let him try to do those things for you.", "I'm sorry but YTA. From what I can see you haven't had a conversation with your husband about this. You're not giving him a fair chance. You're basing your decision on the idea that you MIGHT be bitter if he doesn't deal with the birth in the way that you want/need. You're ignoring the fact that he MIGHT be wonderful and exactly what you need in the moment. Or your birthing experience MIGHT fall somewhere in the middle of those two extremes. It's the first time for both of you. You have no real idea what will happen and you are being unfair to him on the basis of a tv show", "YTA. You're making a decision without giving him a chance. If he stays in the room during birth you may find that he is totally engaged and very joyful about the birth and will be very supportive once he sees what is actually going on. I think you need to give him a chance. He wants to be there so don't make the decision for him.", "YTA\n\n> I should get to be selfish and do what makes me comfortable.\n\nYou're punishing your husband over a hypothetical situation after he didn't get all worked up over an episode of a TV show.   According to my Mom, my Dad was similar - and yet he was the first to notice my brother's heartrate dropped when my Mom was in labor with him (he was watching the monitor like a hawk) and he was straight ready to throw hands with the doctor in defense of my mother when she was in labor with me. \n\nSometimes, people can truly surprised you in the moment - and instead of discussing this with your husband, you're going from 0 to 100 with a \"You're not allowed inside the delivery room and will miss your child being born because I don't think you think it's a beautiful experience\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the end of the day, it IS your choice and it IS about what makes you comfortable - but don't be surprised when there are ramifications to that choice.", "YTA. Most of your conflict seems to be one that you\u2019ve constructed in your head far more than it is grounded in your husband\u2019s actual behavior or feelings - based on his reaction to a TV show about the 60s. You planted a seed then and let it grow out of control. \n\nKicking him out of the birth sounds like planting another seed of resentment towards your husband and I don\u2019t see what he has done to deserve that. I\u2019m a stranger on the internet, but I don\u2019t trust that this is actually what will make you more comfortable rather than a misandrist thought you will indulge in.\n\nAnd it will only get harder after the delivery. Things like breast feeding, sleeping, diapers will all give you more easy opportunities to resent him if you box him out of the role of a father and husband with the attitude that men just don\u2019t understand what it is like.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing better for the baby (or frankly for you), than being good partners to each other. If you start taking away someone\u2019s ability to be a good partner, it is self fulfilling that they will not be.", "I'm not sure if you're TA or not but what I do know is if I was your husband and I ever found out that this is the reason I wasn't allowed to be there for the birth of my child we would be getting a divorce", "YTA. You're going to deny him this experience because he shares a different background and viewpoint than you due to a different upbringing? He may totally feel differently after seeing it in person. Most people do...it's a life changing experience. Ever think he and his Dad feel that way because they were denied that experience and now you are perpetuating it as well? How petty of you to not even give him the chance.", "I can see both sides in this. I think you would be the asshole if you told him you didn't want him there because he \\*might\\* not live up to expectations that you have. I think if you had a conversation outlining your exact expectations for him while he is present in the delivery room and establish clear boundaries/consequences, then you should at least give him a chance to try and see how it goes. If it ends up being a horrible experience, you can always have him leave and at that point, you would not be the asshole.", "YTA. You don\u2019t want him there based on some nebulous standard you have in your head. What is wrong with you? You can always kick him out if he isn\u2019t supportive. Otherwise why would you even have a child with him?", "NAH\n\nHe has specific cultural expectations around child birth. He didn't grow up expecting to be there and the closest person to him to experience it (his mother) either didn't experience it as significant or didn't share it with him that she did.\n\nObviously it's your choice who you want there, but I'm wondering if you're writing him off too quickly. Does he know your expectations around this?", "YTA.\n\nSpeak to him.. Does he actually see birth in the way you think he does or is that a thought you're not claiming as truth? \n\nIf you don't speak to him about it and just uninvite him because you think he thinks that way, you're an asshole who robbed him of his daughter's birth", "I agree with YTA \n\nYou need to sit down with your husband and discuss this. Then educate him ons what you expect and what his role would be. \n\nThe best way to have a birth (in my opinion and experience) I to literally make sure every person you want in that room understands their and each other\u2019s roles. \n\nFor instance with my first baby\u2019s birth: \nMy hubby - support. Tel Jokes, kiss me when needed etc. He also ended up being the person holding the bucket when I got sick and when I was pushing I was literally holding into him. While he was physically holding me. He also did a ton of admin things, fed me, kept giving me fluids to drink etc. He was absolutely amazing. \nMidwife - so what midwives do \nDoula - support midwife \nBaby - chin to chest, relax, keep arms next to body and don\u2019t try and turn mid birth. \nMyself - stay calm, stay on top of contractions, push down  etc. \n\nALSO: Please read up on your partner being your oxytocin provider and how important that is for birthing.", "Definitely YTA. Not allowing your husband to be there for the birth yours and his first child all because you don\u2019t think he\u2019s gonna live up to some sick fantasy you have in your mind? No disrespect, but are you mentally ill? It\u2019s just so hard for me to imagine human beings saying this like this. If you think your husband isn\u2019t going to feel resentment towards you if you exclude him from this precious moment, you\u2019ve lost it.", "YTA. \n\nGuess what it's birth,  it's messy,  it can hurt, it can go unexpected ways - usually (and apologies for those I trigger)  the ultimate hope is an alive baby. \n\nAn alive,  healthy,  perfect baby is a total bonus. \n\nYou are being selfish,  short sighted and just judgement in a way that sets you up on a bad foot. \n\n Go get some counselling,  talk to your husband and be at least open to things may not meet your expectations.", "Yta...of course you can choose who should be in the room but denying him an experience he wants to be part of because he doesn't feel exactly the same way as you isn't fair. \n\nMen don't process pregnancy and birth the same way we do. They could never understand what it's truly like.\n\nThe best thing you could probably do would be going to antenal birthing classes so he can learn how to support you and you can learn how to communicate what you need. They also often open new dad's eyes to how incredibly hard pregnancy and birth are...and how hard recovery is afterwards. My classes even showed the dad's natural and c section videos. The class went into detail of all the bodily changes before, during and after and let me tell you there wasn't a dad in that room that didn't see his partner in a new light after that. They were even taught how to help with massage and emotional support.\n\nSo, writing him off without trying to include him seems a bit rash. \n\nI couldn't imagine giving birth without my husband there and he's not going to look or even cut the cord because he's too squeamish but he's damn well going to be there for me and to see his son for the first time.", "NTA: but I think you should be talking to your husband regarding your feelings (the lack of support, the comments about his mother saying it didn\u2019t hurt). He deserves the chance to apologise, or explain where he\u2019s coming from. Especially if it means he\u2019s missing out on the birth. \n\nI\u2019m purely voting NTA because when it comes down to it, *it is your birth*. But I still think it\u2019s unfair to just base the decision on a gut instinct which involves Mad Men.", "NAH. It's entirely your choice, as it's you giving birth. But I suspect that him seeing you in this difficult, painful process might well change his point of view. \n\nYou can also talk with your doula and make sure they can support you if you decide you'd rather your husband left the room.", "YTA big time. Your husband IS NOT YOU, he\u2019s not going to feel the same way you do all the time. That being said, robbing him of the experience, after he\u2019s already stated he wants to be there, simply because he doesn\u2019t think the way you do, is seriously awful of you. OP, if you\u2019re reading this, and you keep your husband out of the delivery room, he\u2019ll never forgive you.", "YTA - It's his child too and shutting him out of the birth opportunity is mean. Also, it's not just about you, it's about the baby, too.  He should be there with you to welcome her.", "Idk ESH\n\nI would say have an honest conversation with your husband and tell him all the things what u wrote in this post and then ask him how he feels", "YTA - is it normal for you to try to police other people\u2019s authentic emotions? Do you have a history of telling your husband how to feel about things? Are you going to continue this toxic behavior with your child?\n\nYou\u2019ve already set yourself up for disappointment, and now you\u2019re excluding a father from the birth of his baby because you are already disappointed in how you\u2019ve decided he\u2019s going to react.

My oldest daughter (8) who I did not give birth to wants to be there but she doesn\u2019t have the developmental capacity to support me in the way I\u2019d want it. Ofc she\u2019s a child and I don\u2019t fault her for that in any way shape or form. I know plenty of parents invite older siblings and I even feel selfish for not inviting her since I think it would be a good experience for her\u2026but I just really feel like birth isn\u2019t a spectator sport and wanting to be there isn\u2019t enough.", "If I give him a chance and he does something that upsets me, and then I kick him out, do you think that would be worse?

Ridiculous.", "A sizable portion of men and women in his country believe that men should not be at the birth because it will damage their view of their spouse and ruin the marriage. It is a cultural belief. I don\u2019t believe his dad was denied the experience, rather he chose to go get lunch while his mom was giving birth and missed it.", "Thank you.

That will get him more engaged and make the experience in the labor and delivery room better for both of you.", "My point stands. The cultural norms explain why he chose to miss it, but was still denied the experience regardless and doesn't know what he missed.
