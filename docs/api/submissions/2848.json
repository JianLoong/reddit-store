I say this because I am a recovering alcoholic who was diagnosed late in life with ADHD, autism, and severe anxiety/depression.\n\nNot all of us know how to do life without assistance, and if your sister has any issues, she may never have learned to fully fend for herself.

You should have able to enjoy your young adult years and enjoy uni rather that attempt to balance education and  full time work.\n\nYour sister has had plenty of opportunities to address the issues she has, you have tried to help but no longer.

If she's so disabled she loses jobs after a month and cannot handle taking about mental health,  she definitely needs services. Op, are you willing to look up an address for a shelter with services that will help people get their needs taken care of? As someone with both mental and physical disabilities in poverty, sometimes you need to have nothing more to lose to get the help you need.", "When your extended family calls say \u201cwhat date should I tell her to move to your house?\u201d", "Nta\n\nThose who think you should support her can always do it themselves!", "NTA.  I could have written this 20 years ago. You are doing the right thing. You are not required to care for your sister in perpetuity.  That said, I feel like your anger at having been forced to be an adult at 14 is being directed at your sister.  Parents are supposed to care for their children.  I hope you are able to talk to someone and heal from this.", "NTA", "Nta. Write out each family members address who has been critical of you. When she asks, give her one of those addresses. Keep doing it until they all shut. The fuck. Up.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry your sister has been hurt.\n\nBut you are absolutely right to seperate yourself from the situation, and protecting your mother from being taken advantage of.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to have sympathy for someone when they make their problems everyone else\u2019s responsibility, and fail to make any effort to get their own feet under them. Including using depression as a shield instead of seeking treatment.\n\nIt\u2019s easy for other family to criticize you when they aren\u2019t the ones who have been leeched off of since 14.\n\nAt some point you have to save yourself. (And in this case, your mother as well.)", "Family hard they will take the one in despair over the one that is in control of their life. Keep doing what your doing and hopefully the family will see who she truly is. You will be hated and cursed but just like the greatest who thought they were right. They will be judge and their thoughts  because no one saw their perspective. Your perspective don't change what you feel how you feel because family is judging but if your right in the end. Hopefully they'll see it and know you were right. You are your own person don't let people tell you how to run your life. I've been working since I've been 12 washing dishing at the local golf course for 5 dollars an hour. My mom died at 14 from leukemia and my dad got hurt 2 yrs earlier at a accident in the factory then whike recovering got hit by a drunk driver. Life Is hard but stick to your choices they'll prove to be more prominent then their voices.", "Nta and if your family members feel that strongly, *they* can support her.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nI think you need to move to the other side of your country and get a new number. Maybe even a new name.\n\nRun and enjoy your new freedom.", "NTA. She's a grown woman. If you can pay the bills as a teenager, she can figure something out now.", "Nta. Let her stay with the other family members", "NTA. I think her trauma is relevant to the story but she doesn't want to seek help well then that's on her. Sometimes it takes people years to get help. \n\nAnyways when family blows up your phone, add your sister to the text message with that family member and say thank you for their input and when will they make arrangements for your sister to move in with them since they are so concerned?", "Definitely NTA. I hope you\u2019re telling all the extended family to take in your sister if they care so much and then block them on your phone.", "NTA...  you have supported her for all those years, now it's the families problem", "I Googled \"parentification.\"  It didn't give a definition - just linked to u/throwaway9996655.  Odd.\n\nOP, you're unquestionably NTA.  After shouldering the burden of being the breadwinner since your teen years, it's time you got a break and your sister started figuring out how to adult.  And you could probably use some therapy yourself.  Pretty much anybody in your situation would.", "You think that OP resents the fact that she had been having to provide for an adult since she was 14 years old and has had enough of it? Of course she does. And she is right to feel that way.", "Real question: why did OP ask this question here if we\u2019re all supposed to say the same thing? This is strange.", "That\u2019s literally what I said?", "I wasn't objecting to what you said. I was arguing against your judgment that feeling resentment in this situation makes her TA.", "I said letting her become homeless and not caring for her sister made her TA. She\u2019s 100% entitled (and justified) to feel how she feels. Both things can be true. Her feelings don\u2019t make OP TA, her actions do.", "Since OP is not responsible for providing housing for her adult sister - not providing it can't make her an asshole. I'm also not providing housing for OP's sister and that doesn't make me TA. The fact they share DNA doesn't make someone responsible for their sibling for life.", "OK."]}
