It either takes the wind out of my sails, or we have a blast being ridiculous for a few minutes before we have to return to the world of work, bills and adult bullshit", "OP interpreted her as doing it more, but that\u2019s how she speaks. It\u2019s likely OP was aware of it more after asking her to stop and noticed it more than he did before. And of course she laughed. I would laugh too if someone asked me to literally alter my speech before taking to them.", "I actually have said after some comments that I realized giving an ultimatum was wrong and that I should apologize for it and accept that this is just how she's going to speak of I want to talk to her.", "Given their rampant pretentiousness about language and belief that they have some divine right to demand a person speak some way they feel is appropriate, I'd assume they're from another century, not just another decade.", "No.", "Well, we live and we learn. \n\nBut you should still apologize to your sister for issuing an ultimatum you didn\u2019t really mean. Assuming you want to start speaking again, of course.", "Like.... You really need to chill out brah, your harsh vibes are totally bumming everyone out. \n\nIn all honesty, enjoy no contact if the way she speaks to you is not up to your uppity standards. (Shrugs)", "Good on you! Please update and let ilia know how it goes. Best of luck!", "Sounds like you are the one with the problem so it's best you don't speak with her, and wait, didn't she grant your snooty \"If you can't talk to me using plain English, please just don't talk to me at all until you can.\" request?\n\nYou: shocked pikachu", "Have fun being NC with your sister, then.\n\nAnd you'll have to explain your reasoning when people ask. And everyone will know you're an asshole.\n\nSO I guess it's a good thing.", "Well we strictly have what he puts down. So going off that, it seems like she did it intentionally and that makes her a asshole.", "This is a new way of speaking for her.", "You weren't just wrong for the ultimatum. You were wrong for the entire situation. YTA on every level.", "But you also left the above comment we're discussing in this particular moment. You can say that in other comments and still be oozing your condescension in the above one. You may want to work on that condescension that spills into your communication so easily before worrying about other people's styles. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I was thinking the 80s or so just because the sister\u2019s choice of slang is a little outdated. Maybe she just watched a very specific subset of movies to pick up what modern people sound like.", "I just want my normal sister back. I don't understand this new person. I just don't \"get\" it.", "Thank you.", "Even though she talks to everyone like that and not just OP you\u2019re gunna go with she does it on purpose to make him mad? Wild.", "People change the way they speak with time/media influence/experience.", "He still doesn't get it.", "What? That I shouldn't be allowed to thank people? Sorry, I'm not getting it.", "Why do you have to \u201cget it\u201d and control her behavior? Why does she *need* to do what you think is right? \nI\u2019ll answer for you, she doesn\u2019t. The onus on you is to get over it or lose a sister.", "You have no right to demand or force your sister to go back to the way you preferred her. That is the asshole move. I get it, it\u2019s annoying and childish - but she has every right to be that way if she wants. You are old enough to be better than this. \n\nUse your words, go apologize and talk to your sister about how it\u2019s bothering you in an non-judgmental way or demanding way. THEN be an adult and drop it and let her life her life the way she has every right too. Hopefully this will be a funny story for you guys in ten years and not the start of a pointless rift because you think your sister needs to act the way you want and you will punish her if she doesn\u2019t.", "Just be cause you \u201cdon\u2019t get it\u201d doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s wrong. Also YTA for the \u201cnormal sister\u201d comment. \nMaybe she is being her true self after being forced in a box by family\n\nEdit - a word", "Have you asked her why she\u2019s doing it? \n\nHonestly, if she\u2019s anything like my siblings (and me) she might be doing it solely *because* it annoys you and she finds it funny. Perhaps if you stopped reacting to it and tried treating it as normal she\u2019d get bored and give it up.\n\nOr you could consider joining in, speaking to her in a similar way or using other \u201clanguage\u201d than you usually would. Worst case scenario is it does nothing and you feel a bit silly.", "Then ask. Don\u2019t just jump to an ultimatum. It\u2019s just modern slang. However, it sounds like you DO know what most of it means. This screams old person complaining those damn kids. \n\nYTA", "Did you ever think that she wasn't happy being \"normal\"? Did you stop and think about her or her feelings? My dude, you cannot control people like that.", "Try to appreciate your sister for who she is.  Growth is change, she can\u2019t be the person you grew up with forever.  By expecting her to always be the same person, you\u2019re expecting her not to grow and become her own person.  Very soft YTA", "Now your just being purposely obtuse and assuming. So I guess this convo is done. I have my opinion, you can have yours.", "So it's not just slang you have trouble comprehending. I already explained the reason your thank you comes off badly. Maybe ask your sister to help you if you struggle with communication so much, sounds like she is rather fluid in evolving speech and subtext of conversations.", "Thanks, I don't think this will become a huge rift. Obviously, if she's going to keep it up I'm just going to have to find a way to live with it, if we're going to continue to interact. I just can't convey how annoying (and sometimes confusing)  I find it.", "I am really just trying to understand your view point and where you got the idea that OPs sister is doing this specifically to annoy him. Your inability to explain something does not make the person struggling to understand it obtuse."]}
