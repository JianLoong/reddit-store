While they were gone their daughter, Sam (17f) stayed at my house. Sam does not have a driver\u2019s license. This is supposedly because she is scared of driving. I\u2019ll preface what I\u2019m about to say with I don\u2019t know this for sure but I don\u2019t think she has ever really been scared of driving. I think she never got her license because she knows if she did her parents would have her driving an old minivan. I say this because whenever I was around she always showed an interest in driving my car which is a Mercedes. Every time she brought it up my answer would be that I would let her drive if we were ever going down an empty road.  Now whenever I said this I did mean it but if I\u2019m being honest I never thought that would ever happen because I\u2019m rarely ever in a situation where I\u2019m driving and she\u2019s in the car.\n\nShe was at my house for 2 weeks. Near the end I got a call from a friend who needed me to drive him somewhere. This was pretty late at night and she woke up when she heard me getting ready to leave. She wanted to come with me and I didn\u2019t think anything of it. On the way back home she asked if she could drive. I was hesitant because it was dark out and deer frequently jump in the road out of seemingly nowhere. She reminded me of my promise so I pulled over and let her drive. Things are going well until we get to a deer standing in the middle of the road. I tell her to hit the brakes and instead she eases on it. The deer apparently went to the Prometheus school of running away from things because it just started going straight down the road. I had to have been yelling brake by now but she ends up hitting the deer going around 20mph. I get out and look at the car and there is no damage. The deer got up and ran away so it was fine. After that I told her to get out and I finished driving back. She wanted to keep driving and I could tell she was sad when she got out.\n\nThe next day I got a call from her mom and she was mad at me for not letting her drive. When they got back from their trip my brother told me I should\u2019ve just let her drive the rest of the way back because I know how she feels about driving. My SIL has been bringing this up every chance she gets. She didn\u2019t like me before this so I didn\u2019t think much of it at first. Now I need some outside opinions on if I really made the wrong move.\n\nEdit: Didn\u2019t think to say this at first but Sam does have a learner\u2019s permit.", "created_utc": 1676566873, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/113vd2d/aita_for_not_letting_my_niece_drive_my_car/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I hope she had her learners\u2019 permit, but this is how many people learn how to drive in the US. We don\u2019t all get classes in schools with professional teachers in cars with secondary controls. Some of us just get a permit, hop in a regular car and get taught by friend or family.  \n\nYou did do the right thing by switching drivers after the accident.

If you want to let her drive again though, maybe try a parking lot.", "NTA. You gave her a chance, obviously felt it wasn't safe, so you stopped it.", "If she wants to learn to drive she can do so with a certified instructor, not immediately after she hits a deer with your car. Firm up your boundaries hon.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n**You did let her drive**. You ended the drive when she refused to listen to you and then hit an animal.\n\n(Now, arguably, you are TA for letting her drive without a license, but you didn't ask that question, so I won't render my judgment on that element. Besides, I don't know where you live, or if fledgling drivers need a learner's permit, or if, once they reach a certain age, they can just practice with a licensed adult.)", ">Sam does not have a driver\u2019s license.\n\nAnd that should end any argument right there.

You made the wise decision to take over driving especially since she didn't seem too concerned about hitting an animal.", "NTA for not letting your niece drive.\n\nYou were an asshole for letting her drive in the first place!

One time driving down a highway service road like 5 deer were running directly down the middle of the road. I wanted to get by but safely because ik these mfers are erratic af so I tried to pass them in the left lane going like 10-15 mph.

I would of gone with E S H but from one of your comments she does have a learners permit. I\u2019m not we\u2019ll verse in most places besides my state but you had to take a test before you got a permit and I took a driving class at school so she should know basics. \n\nI would say that young drivers are dumb as I was in the backseat of a car where we are all doing driving practice and the driver slowly drove into a ditch.", "You let an unlicensed driver drive, they hit a deer by not following instructions and their parents are bitching you out for not letting the drive continue after hitting the deer.\n\nThere isn't a person who doesn't suck here, including the 17 year old. \n\nESH.", "ESH - You shouldn't have let her drive your car if you felt it was unsafe to do so, period.

And then when given simple instructions, she fails to follow them? Is this for real?", "ESH\n\nIf she wants to learn how to drive, she needs to get her permit and go to a driving class. Just throwing an unpermitted 17yo behind the wheel at night for her first experience--WTF?

First as the child is a minor you should have gotten permission from the parents first. Second her first time driving should not have been at night. You should have just not let her and made specific plans to go drive or taken her to a driving school.  And also YTA for making a promise without thinking. NTA for not letting her drive the rest of the way back.", "YTA - for letting her drive your car at all.\n\nFFS! She's no license and therefore no insurance when driving your car! What on earth are you thinking? How would you explain it to the police and your insurer if it hadn't been a deer but a pedestrian?", "ESH \n\nHer and her parents for being so entitled and pushy. \n\nYou\u2019re TAH a bit for letting an unexperienced person drive a car at night time. If she hasn\u2019t had any lessons at all, she shouldn\u2019t be driving at all. She\u2019s not even insured on your car, so you would have been up shitts creek forking out for any damage if it had been damaged. \n\nAnd I get the feeling if you had tried to her money of her parents, their response would have been \u2018well what are you doing letting her drive the car without a license or lessons?\u2019. Nighttime when you\u2019re running an errand is not the time for a driving lesson.", "ESH. Your brother and SIL suck, and you should have never let her drive without a license.", "YTA.    \n\n\n\n She doesn't have a driver's license. Next to no experience and you let her drive at night on a road that you know has deer cross...... what were you thinking.", "yta\n\nyou're no driving instructor, she has no training, your car does not have the instructor safeties (like 2nd wheel, throttle and brakes) etc...", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
