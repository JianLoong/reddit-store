While they were gone their daughter, Sam (17f) stayed at my house. Sam does not have a driver\u2019s license. This is supposedly because she is scared of driving. I\u2019ll preface what I\u2019m about to say with I don\u2019t know this for sure but I don\u2019t think she has ever really been scared of driving. I think she never got her license because she knows if she did her parents would have her driving an old minivan. I say this because whenever I was around she always showed an interest in driving my car which is a Mercedes. Every time she brought it up my answer would be that I would let her drive if we were ever going down an empty road.  Now whenever I said this I did mean it but if I\u2019m being honest I never thought that would ever happen because I\u2019m rarely ever in a situation where I\u2019m driving and she\u2019s in the car.\n\nShe was at my house for 2 weeks. Near the end I got a call from a friend who needed me to drive him somewhere. This was pretty late at night and she woke up when she heard me getting ready to leave. She wanted to come with me and I didn\u2019t think anything of it. On the way back home she asked if she could drive. I was hesitant because it was dark out and deer frequently jump in the road out of seemingly nowhere. She reminded me of my promise so I pulled over and let her drive. Things are going well until we get to a deer standing in the middle of the road. I tell her to hit the brakes and instead she eases on it. The deer apparently went to the Prometheus school of running away from things because it just started going straight down the road. I had to have been yelling brake by now but she ends up hitting the deer going around 20mph. I get out and look at the car and there is no damage. The deer got up and ran away so it was fine. After that I told her to get out and I finished driving back. She wanted to keep driving and I could tell she was sad when she got out.\n\nThe next day I got a call from her mom and she was mad at me for not letting her drive. When they got back from their trip my brother told me I should\u2019ve just let her drive the rest of the way back because I know how she feels about driving. My SIL has been bringing this up every chance she gets. She didn\u2019t like me before this so I didn\u2019t think much of it at first. Now I need some outside opinions on if I really made the wrong move.\n\nEdit: Didn\u2019t think to say this at first but Sam does have a learner\u2019s permit.", "created_utc": 1676566873, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/113vd2d/aita_for_not_letting_my_niece_drive_my_car/", "score": 265, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that she was perfectly happy to continue driving *after getting in an accident* shows just how irresponsible she is, and I wouldn't want to be driving near her, let alone have her drive my car.", "NTA.  She hit a deer.  It doesn't matter that the car was fine, but I doubt the deer was.  You don't take a hit at 20mph and not suffer some damage.  All that is does not matter, the thing is she hit something without stopping for it when you told her to.  Tell her parents to let her drive.", "ESH.  People aren\u2019t going to like that, but hear me out. You let a person drive your car in the dark without experience and a drivers license. You are at fault too, may not be legally, probably though. Think of it was worse and that was a person and not a deer. You would be up $hit\u2019s creek sans paddle. \n\nESH.", "Lmfao \nNta \nThanks for reinforcing why I hate most of my family. \ud83d\ude02", "NTA had a friend run off the road due to not paying attention some night. Her parents brought us their extra car so we could continue riding around and having fun. She was a brat a spoiled brat. Long story short she grew up to be a crackhead \ud83d\ude02", "NTA... I wouldnt let her drive my car either. It's a privilege not an entitlement", "NTA", "NTA.  She hit something avoidable with your car.   Game was over at that point.", "Getting taught by the teacher ain't that great either. Especially if they got no emotions like my old driving teacher.", "~~Yeah, the fact it ran off does not in any way indicate it was fine... animals often run off to suffer and die...~~\n\nSomeone else already said this, my bad!", "I know someone here in Washington (lots of back roads, lots of deer) who hit a deer that flipped up and went through her windshield. She woke up to white-faced cops readying the jaws of life to cut her out of her car and startled the shit out of them. They thought she was dead. \n\nTurned out all the blood was from the deer lying on top of her (RIP). She got out of it with a broken rib and a concussion. Her car was not so lucky.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/113vd2d/comment/j8ue1k4/?utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3", "Better yet let the deer drive it"]}
