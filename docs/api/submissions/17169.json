I try to keep it short. \n\nI (26F) write FanFiction for at least 15 years. \n\nAs I got older my Fanfictions got longer and more detailed and eventually a bit spicy. \nAnd I am a really big fan of Leonard Snart aka Captain Cold. \nSo about 3 years ago I wrote a FanFiction about him and it has a few very explicit, very spicy scenes. And it\u2019s written in I-perspective ad I write all my FanFiction in this Perspective. \n\nMy best friend joked about it and gifted me a printed version of it for my last birthday(2 weeks ago). She got it printed like a book. \nAnd because it has been while I started to read it just for fun. \n\nI left it in the living room and my MIL was over yesterday and apparently she had a look at it and read one of the spicy detailed scenes. Well it\u2019s not to miss that my best friend printed my name over the cover and so she knew I wrote it. \nAnd she got mad and told me how filthy and slutty it was to write such things about another men then my husband. And how I could do such things. And that I wasn\u2019t faithful imagining such things about another man. \n\nShe told a few family members and my SIL and my FIL are very pissed at me and I am starting to get the feeling I shouldn\u2019t have written that story. SIL texted me that I was a cheating sl\u2018t. \n\nMy husband hasn\u2019t heard about it yet, he is on a work trip and will come home in a few hours so he doesn\u2019t have an opinion yet.\n\nEdit: So my husband came home and he already knew about it. MIL called him on his phone multiple times and he thought somebody died by how often she tried so he answered it before coming home.\n And here is why I love my husband: \nHe took the book and told me to gather all the spicy scenes I wrote and that he would do all that to me what I wrote about after he ate dinner and read the scenes.", "created_utc": 1684001631, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13goly1/aita_for_writing_spicy_fanfiction_despite_having/", "score": 113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s absolutely not unfaithful", "It would be handy if your husband already knew because he's probably already getting the worst perspective from his family without ever talking to you about it.\n\nThat aside, all these people from your husband's family are judging you, and yet at the same time I'd comfortably bet $1000 that at least one of them has masturbated while thinking about someone other than their spouse.\n\nThe fact that you go an extra step and write about it for the enjoyment of others means you exercise creativity to a further degree, and there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nNTA.", "NTA The idea that writing readerfic is somehow cheating on your spouse is ridiculous. Your in-laws are basically claiming that writing romance novels is cheating.\n\nCheating requires that there be an actual live human person you\u2019re cheating with.

I have been writing fanfiction for 25 years now,. A lot of it is very popular too. My husband knows and supports my hobby. It is absolutely harmless and has helped me get through some hard times. Some is explicit some is not. It depends on the sorry. \n\nit's creative writing and you're an adult with adult experiences and interests so there is absolutely nothing wrong with your writing reflecting that.  In addition fiction does not always reflect reality. If you wrote a horror fic would your MIL think you're a murderer? Some of my fave writer friends who write the best smut are asexual. \n\nTalk to your husband about this yourself. Tell him the level of disrespect displayed by his family towards a harmless hobby you've had for years. One that you did not willingly share with them. Their reaction is unacceptable and he needs to understand that it cannot be tolerated.", "NTA and your husband\u2019s offer to read and act them all out is EPIC. Now, that\u2019s a husband.", "NTA. Also... Does your mom think every storywriter of romantic and/or smutty fiction in the world is single?

Does your mother believe that authors are all unmarried?", "WTF? Have they never read a book before? Where do they think fiction comes from, single people only? Have they read horror? They sound religious. Also, MIL was snooping but  apparently that\u2019s morally okay?\n\nNTA. Major AH to yourself for having the book out with in-laws like that.", "NTA. It\u2019s fanFICTION, the term fiction implying that its fictional made-up scenarios that relate to a existing media franchise. Yeah, the hobby is weird to the majority, so it\u2019s not surprising that a reaction like that can occur from your in-laws. What\u2019s shocking is that the implications of you cheating is way out of pocket for them. I guess to them, stumbling upon your dirty writing that you wrote is like accidentally finding out your not vanilla or something, and considering how prudish they sound they are probably thinking that their son is not meeting your expectations, and that your \u201cpromiscuity\u201d is to blame.

I just have one question, is it comics Len or Flash Leonard\u2026", "Your husband is fabulous and congrats on your 1st published book (it counts) .

I will be sharing this communication with (husband). OP'. You need to put her on notice that you won't tolerate her judgement or intrusion.\n\nFinally, shred the printed version now, and dispose of it before your husband gets home. Tell him you realized it was in poor taste to leave out and didn't want to risk it in the future. Just a silly gift from a friend that wasn't well thought out.
