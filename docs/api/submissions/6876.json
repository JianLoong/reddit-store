I\u2019m so sorry you have had to experience this. \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\udc9c", "NTA I would have done things you arn't allowed to say on this sub.", "NTA\n\nThat was abusive and manipulative. Time to cut contact again.", "NTA. No. That is straight up lunatic behavior. Cut her out of your life and never look back.", "NTA - I once had a friend's sister ring me up to tell me she had died. I cried on the phone and it even though they rang me back to tell me it was just a test to see if I cared (she also did it to another friend) I should have realised how shitty it was. Years later and I ended up cutting ties after some other drama but yeah.\n\nYou just don't do that to people. It's selfish as heck.", "This is a horrific, toxic, and manipulative way for your sister to play a joke.\n\nNTA\n\nYour sister and mother need psychiatric evaluation if they find this funny.  You did not overreact, and I would never condemn you for going no contact with them after this.  \n\nTheir behavior was sick and disturbing.", "Block them. No contact. That isn't funny, that isn't fair, that isn't ok at all period full stop. They are so disrespectful of boundaries and invalidating feelings they don't deserve your presence, your time, your sadness overhear fake death.", "I'm guessing that apple didn't fall far from the tree! If your sister and mum can't see how totally messed up that stunt is, they both need psychiatric help. She ruined your special break, cost you money in airfares, and put you AND your dad (and to a lesser extent your BF who was undoubtedly worried and inconvenienced too) through immense mental trauma and distress for an extended period of time, then fucking laughed about it?? You do not need people like that in your life. Oh, and I'd ask for the plane/gas/hotel costs back as well!", "NTA, honestly with a \u201cprank\u201d like this, she IS dead to you. Don\u2019t fight it, block her in everything and move on. You have grieved her enough, honestly.", "NTA.  \nThis might be the worst AITA I've read on here.  \nThis is abuse, pure and simple.  \nI wouldn't talk to her again after something like this.", "NTA, drop that crazy narcissist from your life.  You deserve better than that, next time don't show up even if it's real, that's disgusting of her.", "Nta and remember this moment, people like this do not change trust me!! I've been through it and they just pretend to change. Never feel guilty (it can be hard!) You love your family, you are not the problem. Stay safe out there friend! Good luck to you!", "Your sister is dead (to you), NTA. Cut her out of your life, wtf is wrong with that woman?\n\nIf that was me I'd have punched her square in the face after she opened up that door with her shit eating grin.", "Holy shit\u2026NTA! Your mother and sister need some sort of intervention if they think that this type of behavior is acceptable. If that comes in the form of you, your BF and your dad going NC with them, so be it. It\u2019s so sad to hear you\u2019re going through this OP!", "GIIIIRRRRLLL WTF IS THISS\n\nYou're clearly NOT the Asshole here. Your sis is a walking redflag and you need to get out of that toxicity.", "NTA. Go no contact. Your sister and mother are horrible", "NTA. \n\nIf this is true then you have one seriously fucked up family. This is not normal in ANY way, shape, or form.", "At the minimum, she owes your dad all of the travel expenses including for the cheap hotel room.\n\nA 'joke' like that is bad enough when it is resolved in a few minutes, but being resolved in a few minutes is like 'omg you gave me a heart attack', but impacting a significant trip like that is pretty damned unconscionable.\n\nNTA, but your sister AND her SO are HUGE AH.", "NTA. A \"little test\"?!?  That test cost a plane ticket, 7 hours of anguish, and no remorse for not only emotional but financial stress.  Don't forget to chew that boyfriend of hers out and block both of them.  If your dad has been the only parent that was good and not abusive, of course, it is natural you'll favor him.  Why would anyone favor the parent that was bad to them?  Block all of them OP and seriously go NC because there is no respect, just some petty \"testing\" bs.", "The horror on my face as I was reading this. NTA. What your sister did was insane.", "NTA! I would have said something to her boyfriend as well! omg if possible stay away from her!", "I\u2019m a skeptic about emergencies, I\u2019d be asking all kinds of questions and would then be able to gauge how serious the situation is. NTA however, a normal person would never do anything like this. Go NC now", "nta what the fck", "NTA.  \n\n\nMy jaw just dropped. WTF? You're sister is full-on crazy. Keep you, your dad, and your boyfriend as far away from them as you possibly can.  \n\n\nThis isn't a test or joke. It's vile. One of the cruelest things imaginable. And, they find it amusing. If anything did really happen, I hope you feel nothing for them.", "NTA. You know only sociopaths pull shit like this. Who jokes about their death?", "NTA you so did not overreact. Your mother raised. Mini me in her it sounds like and you have every right in the world to feel what you feel.", "NTA. That is definitely not a joke that would be acceptable in any situation. Your sister is a major AH for doing this. I would go NC and never respond to another call.", "NTA. Your sister only gets to die once, and she used that up. Really no reason to talk anymore.", "NTA  \n\n\nthat is not a test that is abuse and or sabotage", "That's sick. What they did was horrendous...not to mention expensive. I agree with those saying to let others know, and to go NC.\n\nNTA.", "NTA! WTF!\n\nYour sister is (supposed to be) an adult. I expect young children to pull stunts like that (and get punished for it afterwards). And, her boyfriend played along with this?! Cut them out of your life before they ruin it!", "NTA. That\u2019s straight up emotional abuse.", "NTA WHAT. THE. ACTUAL. FUCK. did I just read. That is absolutely mental, if my sister were to do something like this I\u2019d stop speaking to her too.", "NTA , your sister and mum are huge AH, go NC, it will be better for you mental and emotional health. They sound toxic and you need to be safe.  So does you Dad.  \n\nThis was not a test this was cruel and purposely malicious.  And I doubt it will get better or stop.", "NTA. Your sister is a narcissist and I would go NC with her over this. Truly reprehensible behavior.", "NTA NTA NTA\n\nCan not stress that enough. There is no way in hell that you are the asshole here because that wasn't a TEST, that was everything you turned away from your mother for. Emotional abuse and manipulation. I'm so sorry that your sister has shown her true colours right then, and you need to go NC and was your hands of both of them completely. That kind of spectacle is damaging in the worst way, and No. Just No.", "Fuck her.", "NTA, but you should genuinely stop caring about her, she isn't worth it, next time you get such a message don't bother yourself with it even if it is true, cut her and your mother out like the cancer they are.", "NTA", "NTA and half of your family is *insane.*  A \"little test\" does not interrupt a vacation and take seven hours and even if this WAS a \"little test\" it would still be *absolutely cruel to do to someone.* \n\nYour mom and your sister deserve to be NC completely. I'm so sorry you and your dad went through that.", "NTA.  Screw her and her tests.  She just failed big time.", "*Sister is no longer welcome in my life.  Mother, you are no longer welcome in my life either.  The two of you are on your own from now on*\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf your sister is like your mother, you are a saint.", "Lmao wtf\n\nNta 100%", "NTA - but your sister has serious issues and needs to seek help. So foes her boyfriend if he engages in these acts. \n\nShe deliberately caused you horrendous emotional torture. People don't behave like that, and to be honest it looks like she'll go to any extreme to provoke a reaction. Walk away and don't look back", ">also im not for posting drama on facebook et\n\n>but let your friends and family know what happened\n\nAgreed. I'm not one for airing dirty laundry on Facebook either, but there's dirty laundry and then there's utter batshit emotionally abusive laundry.", "Spot on. The FB thing, I agree not posting drama but I would make an exception in this case. I would post OPs post from here except I would change the last sentence from AITA to \"have a nice life and never contact me again.\" Then the block hammer falls for mom, sister and sister BF. Any family member that takes their side in this BS is also blocked... wow", "NTA\n\nAdded to this I would consider suing her for the cost of the plane tickets and emotional distress. And don't forget to tag her boyfriend into this as well. I hope he wakes up after participating in this and leaves her.", "Wtf. Who does this and smiles about it? NTA, OP. I would cut them off so fast.", "And sister's boyfriend, since he was in on it.", ">your mom and sister have serious mental health issues\n\nBipolar as a familial disease **comes to mind**.\n\n(No pun intended.)", "Also show sister the story of peter and the wolf. Someday no one will be there when she does shit like this because no one will take it serious", "Ungrateful creature, she was Resurrected for u, uuuuu... /s\nThis situation is incredibly tragicomic.\nU NTA, OP.", "How does a parent \"discipline\" their adult child?!", "Why would it have not been a big deal if OP was only 20 minutes away? In what scenario would this ever be okay in any way?", "No even 5min would have been the same.", "Even 7 minutes of believing that a close loved one has passed away is too much. The heartache of a sudden loss is unbearable and it feels the worst when you first get the news. Its like you\u2019ve been suddenly hit by a truck and you just want it all to be a bad dream.
