Of course I was absolutely hysterical, I couldn\u2019t walk I was in so much anguish. I frantically packed my bags and called my dad to tell him what just happened and if he could get me a ticket. He did, my boyfriend came with me on the courtesy of my dad not wanting me to be alone. I fly out at 3 in the morning and get picked up by my dad, I\u2019m still losing my mind over my sister.\nIt takes an hour from the airport to her house and so I call her bf\u2019s number telling him I\u2019ll be there and and I need to know what happened when I get there.\n\nI get there and run to the door with my dad in tow, my bf stays in the car out of respect and I frantically wait to be let in.\n\nMy sister answer the door with the biggest shit eating grin on her face, she says So you do care about me?.\nMe and my dad are floored. My dad immediately gets angry (in the saddest way possible) and bitter towards her and starts to huff and puff at her about how that her pulling this isn\u2019t a joke. She just shrugs at it and says towards me: \u201cI only did it so I know you\u2019d even care since you like to choose favorites with our parents.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m still speechless at that point, I gathered enough of myself to tell her that the reason I stoped taking to mom was because of years of mental and emotional abuse and manipulation, that I couldn\u2019t take being used as a middle man or the family failure scapegoat. I told her I just had the worst 7 hours of my life and that this just showed that SHE didn\u2019t care enough about me to think how this would effect me mentally.\n\nNever in my life have I ever felt such grief, sadness, and anguish. I was a mess. \n\nI told her I hate her. I left her house and my dad got us to cheap hotel to sleep at. \nI\u2019m still getting text from her and my mom for what I said was rude and how I reacted was unnecessary for a \u201clittle test\u201d.\n\nI feel like I may have overreacted but I just need some outside perspective, AITA?", "created_utc": 1673245675, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1076yff/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_hate_her_for_ruining/", "score": 314, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
