She ended up working in the foreign service which she did for 5 years but she quit that too. Her parents then paid for her to go to flight school and she\u2019s working as an airline pilot and she has for the past 7 years. Now she wants to quit that and retrain for something that will allow her to be home with the kids more. \n\nHer careers make her interesting and I didn\u2019t mind but I feel at this point she needs to pick one and settle down more.

Your wife sounds remarkably capable and intelligent and should by all means find a job that fits her in all possible ways.

This means; use my skills and vision, decide on where and when I work (ofc filling up the 8h a day) and enjoying the coworkers and company culture.", "YTA why on earth does this bother you? She sounds like a very smart and accomplished person and 5/7 years is plenty of time to have given something a shot before moving on. Unless it's a huge financial strain on the family (which you didn't mention) shut up and support your wife's happiness for christ's sake", "YTA.

And if she doesn\u2019t like having one job, which is pretty understandable, why would she continue? To be miserable and unhappy? Btw it is really admirable how she became a damn pilot and the previous jobs which are very hard imo", "YTA. Your reasoning is that work isn\u2019t supposed to be enjoyable - that\u2019s it. You don\u2019t mention relying on her maintaining a consistent career for financial reasons so it sounds like this is purely based on your own arbitrary expectations of what work is supposed to be like. Your wife prioritizing her mental health and enjoying her career is not a bad thing. If you really want to discuss it with her, I\u2019d suggest approaching the conversation with compassion and a desire to understand rather than being flippant or condescending.", "YTA I am sure you are no Ken.", "INFO: is this causing any financial harm? Is she unable to find work?", "Does it have any bad consequences for you ? If not, y t a for pulling her back. If there is an issue, talk to her in a more mature way, calling her barbie was rude", "YTA. What does Barbie have to do with any of this? Sticking with a job for 5-7 doesn\u2019t make someone a job hopper. As long as she is financially stable and contributing to the household it shouldn\u2019t matter what makes her happy.", "YTA but you're close to the edge if there's stuff that you've left out. Just a bit rude. It can be frustrating to deal with the education and job search support phase in a relationship, but it doesn't seem as if that's a common thing in your relationship?\n\nSome people work to live, others live to work. That basically translates to some people just stand their jobs until they get home (you) while others need to enjoy and find interest in their work (her). She doesn't sound like a serial job hopper. She's sticking with jobs for 5+ years and even spending years in training for them. Most serial job hoppers are changing jobs every couple months to a year. That isn't happening here.\n\n\nYou telling her she \"isn't Barbie\" is rude--you should really figure out why you have such an issue with what she's doing. Are you worried about finances? Is she pulling her weight at home when she's studying/dreaming about her next job? Is she using your job security to live her life to the fullest and you're jealous of that freedom? Her careers are insanely selective careers to get into. She passed med school (for her parents or herself?) and worked that for several years. Then she joined the foreign service! The foreign service is no joke and it's an accomplishment to even be considered. Same for becoming a successful pilot.\n\nYou said she wants to find a job that lets her find more time with the kids, but you're concerned that she hasn't picked a job to settle down more? Isn't that what she's trying to do right now? It sounds like she's trying to do what you want her to do.\n\nI realize this isn't an advice sub, but you should figure out your feelings before you go name calling her again.", "Yta. If you dont enjoy your work you will not be successful  at it. As long as she is not ignoring or bringing harm to the family, leave her be. Encourage her in new endeavours. Nothing wrong with reinventing yourself. You might want to try it.", "Mmm. YTA. So she likes to job-hop? So what? As long as she brings in an income, that\u2019s her choice. Also, who says that one can\u2019t enjoy one\u2019s job? What an odd concept.", "YTA. she is not hurting anyone. We should not live to work, but work to live. And she is living. She sounds brilliant for all these career changes! Honestly, you sound bitter. And she does not quit after few months, she takes her fill of the experience for years then jumps to the next adventure. Thats beautiful! She awesome!", "YTA, Barbie is a lot more well rounded a human being than you seem to be.  From the sounds of it, your wife has had some lucrative careers. So what's the problem if she prefers to change jobs rather than burn out? Especially as a pilot or doctor. She's absolutely right, she should enjoy her work. We all should, in theory.", "YTA - it's her life and her choices.  Just because you're jealous that she gets to go out and experience life while you're stuck in a fluorescent light humming, life sucking cubicle and are miserable doesn't mean that anchoring her down is going to change that.  Maybe you should take a page out of her book.  Also, if you do something you love you never work a day in your life.  So that last line about work not being fun is something that you have to absorb.  I have fun at work and I work in accounting.  (that's almost an oxymoron lol)  Lastly, it was very sexist of you to compare what she is doing to a Barbie doll.  Get over yourself and stay in your lane or you will lose her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGoogle this amazing human being:  Jonathan Yong Kim\n\nNow tell me that one shouldn't enjoy their job and that it's supposed to be miserable.", "YTA.\n\n>she should realise work isn\u2019t meant to be fun, she isn\u2019t suppose to enjoy it.\n\nThis is absolute horseshit.\n\nI was 35 before I finally settled on something. I tried everything I thought I wanted to do and wound up doing something I said I'd never do and loving it. Let her find her thing. Why on Earth should she be stuck doing something she hates?", "Dude I feel sad for you. We should all be living our best Barbie lives. YTA and your wife is an inspiration.", "YTA. Is it financially hurting you? If the answer is no, she should do what she wants. It\u2019s her life.", "YTA. 7 years in a career isn\u2019t \u201cjob hopping\u201d.  I\u2019d like to hear what you do for a living?", "Do you even like your wife? YTA.", "YTA - your wife sounds like an amazing and interesting woman.", "YTA\n\nIf she wants to do different things at different times in her life, and she's successfully supporting herself doing so, that's good and that's her own business.\n\nYou're the one with the problem: you're so indoctrinated, so stuck in the work Stockholm Syndrome, that you think work has to be abusive. I recommend you change that attitude, or you're going to be even more unhappy in future.", "YTA\n\nFirst. Never, ever say a woman isn\u2019t Barbie. Even if you were talking the job hopping, there\u2019s just too many other issues wrapped up in \u201cBarbie.\u201d\n\nSecond. Yes, a career involves hard work and boring stuff.  And becoming a doctor, an FSO and an airline pilot all require hard work.  I\u2019m also pretty sure she made enough money in each of those careers to pay off the last gig. \n\nThird. What kind of FSO was she? A generalist? 5 years is exactly the right point to leave if you don\u2019t want to turn it into a life. It\u2019s enough time for it to be meaningful on a resume, and yet not too long to become overspecialized in this career. If she was an RMO, come on! She was still a doctor.  And I mean no criticism here.  Is it possible she wasn\u2019t tenured at the 5yr mark?  Lots of people \u201cchoose\u201d to leave before they\u2019re terminated for being untenured. (And yes. I\u2019m an FSO.)\n\nFinally, what\u2019s the actual harm here?  Your wife is incredibly successful. The income from each of those is respectable, so that can\u2019t be it.  Are you envious here?", "She's correct. She should be able to enjoy what she does because she spends so much time doing it.\n\nTelling her that she isn't Barbie is belittling and YTA", "YTA.\n\nShe should work what she wants to work. Some people are happy doing the same thing for 40 years and some hate it. There is no right and no wrong, just different preferences. \n\nWhat is wrong is to try force your idea of what should be enjoyable onto someone else.", "YTA. Why not aim for a job that you enjoy? And maybe you are the type that likes to settle down into one career, but that doesn't mean that everyone else should too. In fact, some people don't like the idea of being tied down to one career their whole life, and there's nothing wrong with that. Perhaps your wife prefers doing different things, gaining experiences, *having fun* while working. Good for her.", "I wouldn't call working in a role for 5 - 7 years then wanting another job 'job hopping'  I thought you were going to say she'd start a job and leave after a month or so.", "YTA.\n\nYou're making your wife sound cool as hell... she have a Wikipedia page yet?", "YTA. \n\nJust because you don't like your job it doesn't mean everyone else has to be miserable. She wants to have careers that fulfill her, not just paychecks. If it's not a huge financial liability, then she should do what she wants.", "You sound jealous.\n\nYTA", "YTA. She\u2019s not supposed to enjoy her work? Since when? For the record, I\u2019m on my third career and I LOVE what I do. You sound miserable.", "YTA - and I say that because it doesn't sound like her career shifts have any impact on the household. If anything wanting to go from being a pilot where I would imagine she's gone a lot to doing something that lets her stay closer to the family is a great reason to make a change.\n\nLife is short, and spending 5-7 years in a career to then make a change when life changes isn't \"job hopping\". We aren't doomed to stay in our first career (or second) if it's no longer fulfilling.", "Why do you feel like she needs to settle? Is it because of money/pension?", "YTA.\n\nBecause you made up this nonsense story for imagine karma points and internet clout.", "YTA the jealousy is strong with you.", "YTA. If she can afford to do it and it makes her happy, why does it bother you so much? Why should she have to settle? If she can find a job that she has fun doing, good for her! You sound jealous, to be honest.", "Your wife sounds super intelligent\n\nShe brings in an income\n\nSo what if she likes to change career, it's not like she is changing jobs every few weeks and expecting you to financially support her\n\nShe should write a book about her life, I bet it'd be interesting", "YTA. Why does it matter where she works? How does this effect anything? \n\nHere\u2019s the vibes I\u2019m picking up. If she\u2019s a pilot and has been for 7 years my guess is she\u2019s in a union and recently got a regular job that causes her to be away overnight. This is causing her to miss her kids more and now she want to be home. \n\nMy question to you is, why does it bother you if your wife is home more often and with the kids more often. What are you up to you don\u2019t want her to find out about?", "YTA-what an amazing talented wife! I wonder what she will do next.", "YTA\n\nYou'd of gotten a N A H until you compared her life to a Barbie doll.  I get what you're saying but thats very condescending. \n\nINFO: How old are you two, how old are your kids?\n\nIt sounds like your wife is incredibly accomplished, I get where it's frustrating that she's not dependably employed, but it does sound like the jobs she goes for - she gets them, and they are well paying.  \n\nYes not everybody has FUN! at work BUT that doesn't mean everybody has to be miserable at work. Would it benefit her to go into therapy? Probably, but the goal wouldn't be to settle for 9-5 drudgery.  \n\nPlus - flying planes DOES take one away from the family.  She's not wrong.  It's also a job where somebody has to be extremely focused, you don't want a pilot who's 1/2 asleep because the kids were ill all night.  \n\nAgain suggest she look into therapy not because she's Barbie but because you'd love her to find the thing she enjoys, that meets her criteria ie more home life etc. if she's expecting her career to fulfill all of her 'happy life!' requirements THAT isn't realistic she may need help finding balance, she may have some OCD  etc. \n\nIf your wife is capable of mastering; Medicine, State Dept, Pilot every 5-10years - maybe she will be one of those people who 'jumps' careers all her life.  That doesn't mean it's inherently a bad thing.", "YTA for 2 reasons;\n1. Comparing your wife to Barbie\n2. Thinking she should suck it up and do a job she doesn\u2019t enjoy because how dare anyone try to find a career that they enjoy and makes them happy? \n\nMaybe the changes in career choices is exactly what she needs to do to be happy in her work life because staying in the same field might bore her? Just be thankful she hasn\u2019t decided that you bore her and decides to change that!", ">She\u2019s not barbie and she should realise work isn\u2019t meant to be fun, she isn\u2019t suppose to enjoy it.\n\nYTA. She wants to switch careers to spend more time with your kids and you berate her for it? Great husband and dad you are.\n\nAs long as she has different career options open it's absolutely fine to choose the one that she'd enjoy most and that'd fit her circumstances in life best. I feel kinda bad for you since you must not only be working at a job you dislike or hate but must have also accepted that as the normal thing to do. It's not.", "YTA\n\nIf she was broke and struggling to find work I get the frustration... But here is the thing,  all here careers are high powered and high paying.\n\nWhy can't she enjoy what she does???", "YTA. Sounds like you are jealous that she has the balls to actually seek work that she loves to do. It also sounds like her latest move will allow her to spend more time with the children, which is super important for their relationship with her.", "\"Shame on you, work isn't supposed to be fun! Pick one job that will make you miserable and do it for the rest of your life.\" \n\nSounds like you're quite jealous of how massively talented your wife is and you feel the need to take her down a notch because she is too interesting. \n\nYTA, bet you're tons of fun at parties.", "YTA but I also don\u2019t believe you, how old is she? My guess late 50s? Is she not close to retirement? I wasn\u2019t aware Barbie was known for her job satisfaction.", "So she did almost 9 years in medicine working and is at 7 years as a pilot and you think she should just spend every day miserable because I'm guessing you hate your job so she should embrace the suck? You do realize many companies don't offer pensions anymore so 20 years with a company doesn't mean shit anymore and if this is the US, she still gets social security so what's it matter exactly? She still did a long time in each field. The problem is that when you get burnt out and are MISERABLE mistakes can start to happen and in her fields that could have massively serious consequences, like loss of life level. I'm not saying it will happen but it COULD and that is enough for her to know she needs to find something different that is more fulfilling and isn't what she is doing now. \n\nYou insulting her by comparing her to Barbie, who is associated with being brainless and fake who brings nothing to the table other than physical appearance is crazy. It is just so telling of how little you respect her. It also shows how jealous you are that she is capable of doing two different jobs that are high stress and typically high earning. And she is gearing up to challenge herself with a whole new career experience that probably will be exciting for her while you continue to not value yourself and slave away at a job that kills you on the inside day after day. \n\nBut ultimately I also think this post is fake. Doesn't mean YTA doesn't apply to you, cause it does.", "YTA. She\u2019s working, stop being boring", "YTA. And you're right, your wife isn't barbie.

You may think it isn\u2019t supposed to be fun, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re right. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re bitter.

She ended up working in the foreign service which she did for 5 years but she quit that too.
