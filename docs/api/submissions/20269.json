Turns out I had gallstones and needed to get my gallbladder removed, which happened 2 days ago.\n\nYesterday I was discharged from the hospital, and while the doctor did say I should walk around I don't think I should be 100% back to doing everything I was before the surgery. I asked my husband for just a little extra help with our child. I said I don't mind holding her in my lap for feedings, but diaper changes and anything involving carrying the baby from room to room I'm uncomfortable with, at least the first day or 2 being back home. He got upset because the doctor said I should be fine. We got into a big argument after I explained that this is my 2nd major medical procedure int he last 2 months and I didn't say I wasn't doing anything, I just needed a little extra help. \n\nThis morning, my MIL, who I usually get along great with, stopped me on my way to the bathroom to tell me I shouldn't be asking for extra help. That I have a child now and it doesn't mater what healing I'm doing because the baby comes first. Again, I said I wasn't asking for anyone to take over for the baby completely, I was just uncomfortable carrying the baby from room to room since she is pretty big now and kicks right where the incisions are.

She disregarded your discomfort and, indirectly, suggested you're a bad parent for needing to heal from a literal organ removal.\n\nThe thing is, your MIL stopping you on your way to the bathroom, in the morning, at your own home, clearly shows your husband ran to her and told her you were being unreasonable. Then she chose to scold you instead of helping.\n\nThis requires a long talk regarding boundaries.\n\nIs there anyone from your side of the family willing to give you a hand for a couple of days? Or will DH and MIL finally decide to help you after you pop a stitch or two?", "NTA. These people are a pack of wolves. Do you have any family or friends you could stay with while you heal? If not, call your Ob Gyn, explain the gallbladder emergency and ask if they'd give you a letter to share with your family. The gallbladder doctor was just giving you the generic instructions and not modify them for the fact that you're post partum and caring for a newborn.\n\n\nBut really, these people are horrifyingly awful and I doubt they can be reasoned with.", "NTA.\n\nHe's the father, not the hired help.  He is expected to help.  He and his mother need to get off their \"childcare is the mother's responsibility\" horse.", "NTA - your husband needs to learn a lesson in compassion and his mom needs to back off.", "I have a feeling your husband might be being a teeny weeny bit unreasonable here. Just a little bit. NTA. \n\nAlso tell your MIL it\u2019s your husband\u2019s baby too. How about he put it first.", "NTA. He\u2019s your husband, he SHOULD be helping you after surgery. Why the heck is he getting his mommy involved? Terrible.", "NTA. Your husband should be helping more since you just had a major surgery. Your MIL isn't making sense. You need to heal, or it will affect the baby.", "NTA it\u2019s your husband\u2019s baby too? You shouldn\u2019t even have to ask for help parenting the child you have together", "Nta. It will take at least 2 weeks to fully heal from this last surgery, this first week is the tougher one. I\u2019m an NP, have had my own gallbladder out (and am a mom), and just spent a week helping take care of my adult (childless) sister after she had hers out. She rested while I grocery shopped, made meals, stocked her freezer with more meals. Reorganized her pantry, kitchen cabinets, and 4 closets (with her permission and input) hauled a carful of donations away, cleaned her house and took care of her pets before flying back home. And I\u2019d still be there happily helping if she had an infant. You MIL is uneducated about this at best and is adding to stress by sharing her unsolicited opinion and unhelpful advice. You asked for help instead of suffering silencing, which is what her generation was taught. Does she not realize babies pick up everything, including if they are causing physical pain to their mommas? You deserve a voice and the extra help while you heal. She also might remember if she wants a good relationship with that baby, pissing off it\u2019s mother is not the way to go about it. Your partner needs to step it up, and have your back, without his mommy, pronto.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband ran to his mom when he had a disagreement about you asking him to step up a bit and take care of his baby.  Sounds like he needs to grow up.", "NTA- But, did you try reminding him that he's your husband and your child's father?  Maybe he just forgot that he has any responsibilities whatsoever.", "NTA. Your husband is lazy and pissed that he has to change diapers. What you asked (that he carry the baby and bend over to change the baby) is minimal.", "Sounds like you have two babies, a newborn and a mama\u2019s boy. NTA and insist on the help you need for yours and the newborn\u2019s sake!", "So what do they want? A doctor\u2019s note? Get on the phone with your doctor and get a detailed list of all the things you can and cannot do while healing from TWO surgeries in the last 8 (?) weeks? Good grief!", "NTA;  You need support, your partner is not providing it, and your MIL is being judgemental rather than helpful.\n\nCan you stay with your parents?", "NTA.  Those two can go straight to hell with their ignorant nonsense.  They are wrong on every single thing.", "You are NTA. Call your OB, and ask them for direction. IMO, this surgery recovery should basically be treated like a c-section recovery... no lifting over 10lb, no stairs, minimal to no bending, etc. I had mine out 4 months postpartum with my 2nd kid, and that's what my doc told me to do.", "You are absolutely NTA but your husband is being one. It is completely reasonable for you to be requesting extra help considering what your body has been going through the last several months, and reasonable to be asking it of your spouse. The fact that your MIL is getting involved is also unacceptable. You need to tell MIL to get back in her lane and make it quite clear to your husband that he helped make the baby and he needs to care for baby in whatever capacity is needed for you to recover.", "NTA. I hope you leave that toxicity - it's not a good environment to raise the baby in.", "NTA.  Even if you hadn\u2019t just had surgery\u2026.why is your husband unwilling to TO DO ANYTHING for his child?  His mother should be harping on HIM to take care of  baby, it\u2019s his too\u2026and as she says, baby comes first.", "you are NTA.  I am so sorry that you're stuck with such selfish people.", "NTA. The lines of division have been drawn, it\u2019s you versus them now apparently. I do not envy what you\u2019re in for. A husband who thinks that taking care of his own child is babysitting, and a mother-in-law who agrees with him.\n\nCall your doctor and ask if you\u2019re allowed to have help with the baby. Since his is the only opinion that matters to these idiots.", "Why did you marry an ableist asshole?\n\nOtherwise NTA", "NTA. You are also recovering from anesthesia. They are thoughtless.", "NTA. Getting the gallbladder removed is no picnic. \n\nYou need to first have a talk with your husband. Tell him that if he has an issue with you, that he needs to discuss it with you, and not go running to his mommy. That you didn\u2019t appreciate her lecturing you. And the next time he gets a \u201cman cold\u201d he is on his own. You didn\u2019t ask for an issue with your gallbladder, and the saddest part is that you were looking to him as your partner, and now you see that his role as a partner is conditional.\n\nThen you need to talk to his mother. Tell her, that you have always respected her and thought of her in a positive way. Well that has now ended. Since she put herself in the middle of your marriage. If she hasn\u2019t had a gallbladder removed, and especially after giving birth, she don\u2019t know what it is like. But now that she has meddled, her visits with LO is now only when her son is home. If she stays over that she will now go to the hotel. That you see how she really is now, and you want no part of it. Tell her to research it.\n\nAfter open surgery, you'll usually have to stay in hospital for 3 to 5 days, and your recovery time will be longer. It can take around 3 to 4 weeks to return to your normal activities, and 6 to 8 weeks if you have a more manual job.\n\nDos and don\u2019t\n\nDon't do any strenuous activity or lift anything heavy for at least a couple of weeks. At any time, if any activity causes pain or pulls on the incisions, just don't do it. You may be able to go back to a desk job after a week depending upon how much pain you are having and how energetic you feel.\n\nI had mine removed. No picnic. I did go back to work after a week because I was bored. But my boss had made sure I was comfortable, had everything brought to me and no walking. Just say in a comfy chair the whole day for a week.\n\nEdit to add:\n\nNow that your gallbladder is out, careful after you eat at times you need to be near a bathroom. \n\nNever wear white pants for a while. Farts can turn into sharts, just sayin. \n\nThose are my side effects", "NTA.  Honestly having my gallbladder removed was the most painful recovery of my life and I've had a hysterectomy, breast reduction, eye surgery, etc.  It took me a week just to walk around normally.  I cannot imagine carrying a baby around, too!  You need to find an advocate before you end up with postpartum depression.  Your doctor is apparently a misogynist.", "NTA and calling it \u201cextra help\u201d is ridiculous. It should be a no brainer for him to look after his own child while you recover. It\u2019s not \u201cextra\u201d. It\u2019s fucking normal. I wouldn\u2019t take what your MIL says seriously, she has clearly enabled his entitled lazy ass behaviour in order for him to be like that so she is a cause and effect. Fuck em both.

I'm sorry you're going thru such a difficult time.", "NTA do you have friends or family you can stay with that can help? You\u2019re not going to get any help from them. They way they are treating you is disgusting.", "Ah, yet another man not understand that having a child includes responsabilities and that he is not a baby-sitter, he is a father and he should\u2019t \u201cbe asked\u201d to help, he should just **do it** because he\u2019s the fucking father \ud83e\udd70\n\n(NTA)", "NTA.

I was, my bad. Edited", "It sounded to me like he gave no instructions on lifting restrictions, and walking short distances, yes....not taking on normal mommy duties immediately.

Unlike you I actually do have a medical degree - I didn't realize I was talking to your father.\n\nThis is a laparoscopic surgery. A 2 month old is well below a lifting restriction anyways for most minor surgeries. Most parents would be comforted that they could lift their child should they need to. I'm not arguing she should be expected to do everything - I'm saying this is her husband and MIL at fault, not her surgeon.", "Another female MD here. Outpatient mental health. Agreed with you on all fronts. Husband and MIL are the dicks here and need to step the fuck up. \n\nA bigger concern for postnatal depression is that mom doesn\u2019t have enough help with baby so she can get the sleep she so desperately needs to heal. If they don\u2019t care to support her recovery from surgery by doing more for baby, you know they aren\u2019t helping her get consolidated sleep.", "I had laparoscopic surgery to remove my gallbladder way back in 2000. The worst part of the recovery was the excruciating shoulder pain post op. I had the surgery on a Friday morning, was home Friday night, and back to work on Tuesday morning. I was never given lifting restrictions. \n\nActually, the scariest part of the whole surgery was when the anesthesiologist came by to dope me up. He came over to my bed with the BIGGEST NEEDLE I've ever seen in my life. I used to donate blood a lot and those needles were pretty large, but this was next level. I said to him, \"You're putting that thing in my arm?!?!\" He just laughed and injected whatever it was into the IV line/port/something like that. IIRC I was singing 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" by the time they wheeled me in.", "NTA.  Having had my gallbladder out 5 months post-birth, I can vouch for difficulty lifting and carrying just after.  Lifting, carrying, coughing, sneezing, even laughing hard was excruciating.  \n\nIt kills me when men are asked to \"help with the baby.\"  IT'S CALLED PARENTING.  It's not a d@mn favor.  It's part of the job description. \n\nSee if SO and MIL will agree to a simulation.  Stab each of them 4-5 times in various parts of the abdomen with a 5\" stiletto, and then they can carry the baby around.

Baby, tore badly and needed stitches. Few months later I needed gallbladder surgery. Had my SO acted that way I would have taken my happy ass 18 hours away to my own family with my child.

The father is a lazy asshole and went running to mummy because the woman isn't doing her duty and the MIL reinforced that. Both of them are assholes, you can't ignore healing and just care for a baby.

Who tf does MIL think would take care of baby if something happened to OP due to complications from pushing herself too hard? Or is this part of MILs nefarious plan to get the baby? \nJk.

I was five months postpartum when it happened to me.", "That's interesting! My lifting restrictions after a laparascopic cholecystectomy was 10lbs, and a 2mo baby is usually 11+ lbs. \n\nMy youngest was about a year old when I had my surgery, so he was well past that. My partner isn't a jackass, though, so he just helped me when it came to carrying the kids around. He wouldn't even let me do diaper changes in case an ill-placed kick caught me in a wound.", "Depends on the surgeon (and your surgeon is absolutely who you should listen to on restrictions post-surgery). Nothing over 10 kgs is common at a lot of sites, some will be more cautious and go lower like you experienced! Some surgeons will leave it at \"no heavy lifting\" - what they are all trying to avoid is making you strain. The biggest thing is you should also listen to your own body when you are recovering- its obvious in this case it hurts and she shouldn't be doing it.\n\nEdited to add: Gentle activity, light lifting (incld breastfeeding if mom wants - a lot of parents requiring surgery immediately postpartum are hugely upset by the thought that they aren't allowed to do this and are relieved that they can do basic tasks if they feel up to it) does not mean having sole responsibility for a new born. My main point was that a general surgeon (not an obstetrician talking about postpartum recovery) giving basic post-op instructions does not equal misogyny. There are plenty of very real cases of mistreatment of women in health care - this doesn't seem to be the main issue at hand here.", "NTA - after anesthesia you definitely should have someone else carrying the baby for a few days. It can take awhile to work completely out of your system. \n\nAlso your husband is also a parent and the baby comes first for him too, which means making sure the baby is safely carried around the house and secure while changing (no groggy mommy on painkillers!)\n\nYour husband is a whiny baby.", "NTA What kind of husband complains to his mom because he doesn't want his wife to have time to rest or recover from surgery and childbirth? \n\nHow inconvenient for him that a person he loves and is committed to needs his support.
