Fast forward to after college and our paths cross again. We\u2019ve been dating for two years with constant issues caused by his mom (his dad was the nicest person, but sadly passed away years before we started dating).\n\nI know every story has two sides, but my boyfriend and his sisters (all 4 of them) know his mom is in the wrong. They\u2019ve all had many problems and fights in their own marriages because of her constantly interfering and making nasty comments.\n\nI\u2019ve been dealing with this for two years and very recently it reached it\u2019s peak when she sent nasty messages to me (I responded respectfully as always) and she went as far as to send nasty messages to my boyfriend about me. She has never met my mother in person and even went about insulting my mother, religion etc. She even claimed I was using her son and she gave him an ultimatum of choosing me or her. (PS I pay most of the financial expenses in our relationship so not sure what I could be using him for).\n\nAfter she sent the nasty texts I remained respectful, but have decided to not talk to her until she apologizes to me. My boyfriend is trying to avoid the drama by acting as if it doesn\u2019t exist, but it\u2019s making everything uncomfortable to the point where his sisters (who I have amazing relationships with) has decided that because of the uncomfortable vibe, he needs to meet them for coffee etc. alone stating I am not allowed to go with when his mom is there. I think that it\u2019s quite obvious that this will be an ongoing thing for all events such as holidays, birthdays etc. But why do we need to be separated because of his mom? I didn\u2019t say or do anything offensive towards her.\n\nShe never apologizes for anything. Her own kids banned her from Christmas last year because of her behavior towards them (she still has not apologized), she just goes on and blames everyone else so they have given up on waiting for any apologies. I feel like the least she can do is apologize to me and I don\u2019t need to let it slide.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that my boyfriend experienced the same issues with his mom in his previous relationship also leading to a breakup.\n\nMy boyfriend\u2019s mom doesn\u2019t like anyone in her children\u2019s lives besides her. We got along very well up until he notified her that we are together after that she started calling me his ex\u2019s name on purpose, gossips about me, says nasty things whenever she gets a chance etc. She is emotionally manipulative with her own kids and they admit it too.. She wants to be the main character and when she needs to take accountability for anything she blames everyone else and starts to cry.\n\nAm I the asshole for telling my boyfriend that if he isn\u2019t going to deal with his mom and put some boundaries in place, that I am leaving?", "created_utc": 1697548050, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/179xyp1/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_to_get_his_mom_in/", "score": 86, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But your issue isn't with the mother - it's with your boyfriend. He's prioritizing the feelings of a disordered narcissist over you, his partner. This speaks VOLUMES about his character and integrity. He will not put you first. Take this information for the gift it is and break up with him now. If you don't you can expect this bullshit to go on forever. \n\nThe ultimatum you gave him is useless. Why? Because if it takes the threat of you leaving for him to do the RIGHT THING, then his motivations are crap. You want to be with someone who willingly and voluntarily and readily defends you against bullies, even if they are his own family.", "NTA. \n\n>My boyfriend is trying to avoid the drama by acting as if it doesn\u2019t exist\n\nYou don't have a future if this is how he wants to live.

I\u2019m not certain why you don\u2019t just block her number or just don\u2019t respond to her. Why does everyone continue to engage with & tolerate Mom\u2019s nonsense? \n\nI think your bf needs to either figure out how to mange his mother or at the very least keep her away from you. Sure ask for an apology from her. Doesn\u2019t sound like that will fix anything.", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend needs to get some balls and stick up to her. He being very aware this is an ongoing deal with his mother and acting like nothing happened is simply him being a coward.\n\nYou also have to ask yourself, if he didn't set her straight for calling you his ex's name, and he didn't set her straight for sending rude texts to you, and he's trying to act like nothing's happened, What do you think the future is going to be like with him?", "NTA. You have a huge SO problem despite his Mom's track record with his siblings. Start laying your boundaries now, before your relationship gets anymore serious.\n\nIf you two work through it, great.

He KNOWS and he doesn\u2019t CARE.", "NTA.\n\nDoes his mom have a personality disorder? \n\nI think you should block her and make sure she does not come im your home. There is absolutely no point in engaging with her, so dont play her game.\n\nSecond I would say that you will never get an apology, since it is not in your bfs control to make her do it. So maybe drop that.\n\nBut yeah, your bf needs to set boundaries in place. He might also need a bit encouragement by you to do it? His mum is probably beating down on him his whole life. Maybe he needs someone to positively encourage him to stand up? Mayve he wants to do that since a while but did not figure out how?\nI mean his whole relationship with his crazy mother is defined by avoidance. Once a pattern sets in, it is not easy to get out (however, he needs to and should).", "NTA - the boyfriend's mom is very much in the wrong and he should consider no-contacting her if she's not going to change her tune", "NTA - I\u2019m sick of grown adults acting entitled to act completely immature and straight up mean.

Screams narcissist behaviour.", "NTA Your boyfriend needs to put a stop to this narcissist immediately. The fact that he isn't sticking up for you is disgusting. Imagine this woman when/if you have children. Absolutely not. Get out while you can.", "NTA you need to ask him how he plans on dealing with his narcissistic mother. Avoiding the problem is not an acceptable solution. How will your life be dealing with her hatred? How will she be if you decide to have children? If he isn\u2019t willing to stand up for you now he never will be. Maybe he needs to see a therapist to learn how to set boundaries with her. But ask yourself if this is the future you want.", "NTA, not one bit. If he's not willing to step up, he's not your partner. Why would you want to waste your life being second in his life? \n\nYou're giving him a choice, if he doesn't choose you then move on. You're never an AH for that.", "Thanks for all the insights from everyone and all the advice! Appreciate your input and I\u2019m definitely taking everything into consideration!", "Don't bother. Hand him back to his mommy, you'll never pry him loose from her stranglehold.", "Look, this clearly isn't something you caused, and it's not something you can fix.  This woman has a long history of being terrible to people around her children (and TO her children, apparently).  And they deal with it in their own ways.  He needs to deal with it, not ignore it.   It's his Mom.  \n\nHaving said all that, if my BF was this spineless, to let not just me but other women go because of his reaction to his Mother's behavior....well, that's too bad for him, but I'm gone.  I wouldn't even try to set the boundaries with this one.  If her children are banning her from Christmas, *and she still hasn't apologized*, what makes you think you'll EVER get an apology, much less the one you deserve?  If you move mountains you MIGHT get a \"sorry you feel that way\" and then it'll just go back to status quo.  Just cut your losses and walk away. \n\nYou wouldn't necessarily be an a h for talking to him about it, but.. you kind of will be for continuing to put up with it.  Like I said, just walk.  You're young, count this as a life lesson in what you will and won't tolerate.  In this case, I wouldn't tolerate this behavior from my boyfriend or his mother.", "NTA and you ga e my sympathies \n\nmaybe go check out jystnoMIL. (I may be missing some capital letters on the subreddit, but I am sure you can find it. And find plenty of people in your shoes).", "NTA - BF has dealt with her all his life, so her behavior is more normalized to him. At this point, I seriously doubt she will ever acknowledge her actions, much less apologize. You have every right to  expect him not to tolerate it and protect you from her toxic games. If he won't, you are faced with choosing between being marginalized the rest of your (her) life or moving on.", "You\u2019re never going to get an apology and need to get over that. It won\u2019t change anything. Block her everywhere, refuse to talk to her or about her and live your life.", "Your bf needs to man up.  Ignoring an issue does not make it to disappear.", "Wait, you are the financial support, he doesn't deal with his Mom on your behalf, and you are still with him?\n\nWhy?  You are NTA if you break up with him.  YTA if you don't.", "Info- this is how his mother had been for years, it's how she treats his siblings, it's how she's treated his past relationships, you *knew* this was how she was before the relationship started... why were you expecting it to be any different for you? \n\nDo you honestly think your boyfriend will say anything now? After more than just the 2 years you've been together, but after his whole life? You aren't asking him to say something to her, you're asking him to cut her out of his life completely, because you know she's not changing.\n\nAre you actually expecting *any* kind of apology? I hope that isn't any kind of sticking point for you, because everyone involved knows that is *never* happening.", "NTA - for the ultimatum, clearly his family ignores her and you should too. Why haven\u2019t you blocked her? That\u2019s on you. Just block her and make sure she isn\u2019t invited to things at your place. If she speaks to you, ignore her or leave. Don\u2019t spend any energy on her. It seems like her children are already moving in that direction and you\u2019re just making it harder on your bf who already chose you.", "YTA for the ultimatum.  What do you honestly expect to change here?  You cannot force someone to apologize or change behavior on the other hand you cannot force your BF to cut his mother off and choose only you.  Maybe he isn't effectively doing this but he is trying, his sisters are trying.  Wouldn't it be more constructive to establish boundaries together (and not just what you want.)  Your attitude is not much different from his mom's it's your way or the highway.  Relationships are give and take.  While I am not suggesting you put up with her abuse, you both need to establish personal boundaries as well as boundaries as a couple.  Ultimatums do not work.", ">if he isn\u2019t going to deal with his mom and put some boundaries in place, that I am leaving \n\nESH, Everyone Sucks Here.\n\nIf you've known this woman 2 decades and have been dating this guy for 2 years with \"constant issues,\" then you have already gotten more than enough history with the topic.  Issuing an ultimatum is asshole behaviour, just make your own decision about the relationship already.\n\nYour boyfriend's mother sounds awful, but it sounds like all her children prefer to deal with her on their own terms.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Thanks for your comment!", "If you do ultimately decide you need to leave, you could give him a parting gift of Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents (book).", "I hate too say it OP but I'd get out while you still can. It's been two years and clearly getting worse with no end in sight...BF will always be Mummy's liddle man and you should be the priority but I don't see it happening. Good luck and throw us an update!", "Also an ultimatum isn\u2019t healthy and not a boundary.", "Thank you! I\u2019m going to have the conversation with him and if he follows through maybe we stand a chance otherwise I\u2019m prioritizing myself for once!", "I\u2019m so sorry that you had to deal with that! It\u2019s horrible to go through and I\u2019m so happy to hear that you\u2019re hubby stood up for you! Thank you for your insight and sharing your story!", "Just try to ignore her. Let her think & say whatever she wants. \n\nThis is not a person who is kind, respectful or trustworthy. Her actions & words should mean nothing to you. You do not need this persons approval nor should you waste your time or energy seeking her approval.\n\nHer problems are her problems. Not your problems.\n\neta \u2014 I\u2019m guessing but it sounds like Mom is narcissistic. Very challenging to deal with. I hope y\u2019all are able to work together to find some ways to cope with her nonsense.", "She feels safe to do that because she can see that her son still is in contact with her despite all this. She knows that the wedge is placed and that she only has to push on it a little more for you to separate from him. Then she has reached her goal. If you value your relationship, he has to realise that. He has a choice: he can either stay single for as long as his mother lives, or he can choose you and his mother needs to deal with him going no contact.", "And also OP, why are you contributing more financially? Because it seems like you\u2019re doing way more (having tolerated the mom, his dismissive behavior etc) in the relationship than he is. Honestly, redirect your efforts into being single and then finding a partner who does respect you.", "I know it's hard when you really love someone. But they should love and respect you equally. Best of luck to you.", "They have a great booklist that has some books that your bf may want to take a look through. This won\u2019t end until you end it with him or he stops playing her games and starts making his own rules.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/wiki/books/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&rdt=45482", "She won't change or back down, and I doubt he'll actually talk to her. \n\nYou're in a no win situation. \n\nHe chooses to cut her off without you saying anything, if you brought that idea up then you would be the AH.\n\nHe says nothing, she keeps treating you like crap, and you just suffer for the rest of the relationship. That option sucks. \n\nYou dump him because he doesn't, and has never, had the spine to stand up to his mother. I'm sure you'd like to be with him, but this won't get better, and if you ever get married or have kids, it will get worse, because it means she will be locked into your life.", "Sorry about that. You know who she is and don\u2019t have to engage. It isn\u2019t like your bf or his family listens to her when she says negative things. Just don\u2019t go to things if she\u2019s there and cut her out. That includes the wedding. Set conditions where she might be permitted and if she and your bf won\u2019t respect your boundaries, break up and move on.", "I think this is a good idea as a gift if we split up or not.. Thank you for your advice!", "Thank you! I\u2019ll update after having a thorough conversation with him. I appreciate all the insight!", "So random example, if my partner were to take up smoking. And I said I never agreed to have a partner that smoked, so if you don't stop, we're finished. That wouldn't be okay?", "Did anyone say an ultimatum was the same as a boundary?", "Thank you kindly for your advice!", "Our finances just worked out that he has more study loans so when it comes to rent we split 50/50, but gas and groceries I cover as well as the household chores (he is in charge of gardening). I\u2019ve never minded it at all.. But as you said dealing with his mom and his dismissive behavior and contributing physically and financially more is just not adding anything to my life or emotional well-being! Thank you for your input!", "Thank you kindly for your input!", "Very true! Thank you kindly!", "Thank you for the advice, I appreciate your point of view on the matter! You\u2019re right!", "Release this spineless mooch so he may suck upon his mother\u2019s teat freely.", "Just be careful. You clearly like this guy and maybe couple\u2019s counseling is a good way to negotiate boundaries because you have someone as an arbitrator.", "Thank you! I\u2019ll consider all options and make a decision that would be best for everyone involved! Appreciate your suggestion and advice!"]}
