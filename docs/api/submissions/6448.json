That's not a normal expectation and you can't be blamed for not considering it.", "NTA- you cut them in half and they dry out.

I think a lot of people wouldn\u2019t think to do that. It\u2019s a good idea. She should just let up & accept you will do it next time.

Next time eat all the donuts because ungrateful people do not deserve mochi goodness.", "nta wtf", "NTA. It\u2019s one thing if they\u2019re sitting out at work or you brought them all home to graze, but it\u2019s a pain to do this on the go and who wants basically leftovers her way.", "The correct response is \" awe thank you for the Donetsk i appreciate you!,\" not whatever tf this is\n\n\nNta", "YTA though not a big one. Just text or call and check next time. Communication is a big one in marriages, even for little things.", "NTA. Now that you know better, you can do better.", "NAH. Honestly, I think your mistake was not waiting until she was home so you could talk about what to do with them, but it wasn't an unreasonable way to divide them and you could always buy six of the same kind next time you go and give her the flavors she didn't get to try this time.", "NAH in my marriage there would likely have been a text discussion as to what the flavours all were and if either of us had any preferences.", "Um he committed a donut sin, he must repent with more donut flavors. This is the way.", "Um as a donut expert they do NOT dry out in a matter of hours. Must try all the flavors!", "I agree with this take. They just had different expectations. I'm with you and the wife though, it's totally better to split 6 instead of each taking 3 different flavors and missing the other 3.", "Also he needs therapy too!", "You forgot to put the /sarcasm at the end", "Also he put it here and we have read of it, so he has to get us donuts too right? Please? Heck I want a donut now!\n\nBtw OP you're NTA, I get her wanting to try them all but you had no way to know she would want you to cut them all in half. On the upside you now have an excuse to buy six more so you can each try the ones you missed first time!", "I'd be disgusted if you did eat half of each one - I definitely wouldn't be eating the other half's! lol\n\nI'm assuming this doughnut shop isn't a pop up therefore there will be other times she can try the other flavours.

Thank you very much Reddit.", "Let me change that for you \u201cAita for marrying an entitled wife who doesn\u2019t appreciate me?\u201d", "NTA.  People respond to incentives and your wife is training you not to do anything nice for her.  Next time buy six artisan donuts and keep them somewhere other than your house, eat three one day and three the next.", "NTA have you considered divorce?", "NTA ( but that is with the view that you didn't leave her flavours she didn't like or took all the tasty ones.)", "You know what's not polite, bitching about something nice someone did for you. Next time, just get enough for yourself to eat. You are NTA.", "Not judging. But when I do this with my friends we just cut them in half so everyone tries everything.", "My God people, how old are you two? That's some childish argument you two have. If you left halfsies she could've argued that what you did is gross.\n\nThe mature thing on her part would've been to thank you for the gesture and tell you that next time leave her the flavours she hasn't tried yet. Or simply ask you the name of the place and go herself and pick whatever flavours she wants. \n\nOn your part, if the donuts were bought specifically for her you shouldn't have touched them before her. It's like buying someone a pair of shoes and wearing them first. \n\nESH for how you both dealt with the situation.", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain and suggest YTA. \n\nThis is silly and ridiculous. But we all have silly ridiculous things that matter to us. It is part of what makes us unique. For me I get annoyed if my partner opens fresh bread from the market before we get home, infuriates me every time (which I suspect is why she does it\u2026). \n\nYou probably should have known this kind of thing mattered to your wife. And as silly as it is it\u2019s harmless. She wants to share the experience and flavours with you. Or she\u2019s a curious person and didn\u2019t want to miss out on new things. \n\nOn the upside you got to learn something new about your wife! A silly thing that matters to her. How cool is that?", "She is not the AH for wanting him to save half of each doughnut (sorry, I just couldn't spell it the American way, it felt nasty)\n\nShe's the AH for getting upset at him for some weird rule that was only in her head after he did something nice for both of them.\n\nNTA", "Doesn't it just give you an excuse to buy more though? Not that I personally think people need an excuse, but some people like to justify things in their own minds I guess.", "INFO is she actually mad at you or just saying that's what she would like in the future? NTA either way.", "I have to say NTA.  I would be annoyed if I got 6-half donuts.   You were so super thoughtful.  If there is a next time, Next time she bitches tell her your donut duty has expired and she can buy her own in the future.\n\nI", "Next time just get two of each flavor and eat one of each flavor. NAH, but I don't know how you didn't see this one coming.", "NTA. I hate people who do this at work - no one wants partially eaten donuts.", "Gift horse mouth looker\n\nSorry you married a sack of flour", "NTA. Your wife is being absolutely ridiculous.", "NTA. Yeah, I agree with her that it's a better way to split her, unless you didn't like the other ones, but it's not rude or anything to split it the way you did.", "I could see a situation where you ate all your wife's favourite flavours and being an A. Otherwise just say lesson learned and either order 3 of her favourites or cut them all in half.", "Info- did you take all the \u201cbetter flavours\u201d and she got your leftovers, or flavours that are not seen as being as good?", "NTA. While I would have strongly preferred your wife's method of trying half of 6 donuts, I think you're fine. I am impressed you ate 3 mochi donuts - those things sit in my stomach like lead balloons.  \n\nNow that you know this preference for your wife, however, I would advise that at least sometimes you split things her way. She sees it as more polite, and therefore it would be a kindness to her.", "YTA I think that most comments here don\u2019t realize what mochi donuts are. The highlight to me of mochi donuts are the different flavours you can try. And each mochi donut has balls of donut connected together that are supposed to be ripped apart to be eaten. So there aren\u2019t really issues of them drying out. I\u2019m guessing she probably expressed that she wanted to try these to you before and you were kind enough to get them as a surprise for her during one of your errands. But why would you not just wait to try them all with her? And if you were to eat them you definitely should\u2019ve eaten maybe one or two pieces of some, then waited to eat the other ones with her. \n\nI also think this depends on if this is the first time you tried mochi donuts. If you\u2019ve had them before then it\u2019s not a big deal for you to eat three. But if you both haven\u2019t had mochi donuts before the big allure IS to try all the flavours with the interesting mochi texture. \n\nPeople who are saying that you can always get more donuts are missing the point lol. He ordered 6 for them both to enjoy and she didn\u2019t get to try them for what they\u2019re supposed to be known for\u2026 the flavours. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re a huge asshole and I don\u2019t think she is ridiculous. Just get a new box I guess and eat them together. It\u2019s more fun anyways to try the flavours together.", "NTA.  Your wife is being unreasonable and a bit entitled.  You were considerate enough to bring her donuts.  She should be thankful.  A lot of men portrayed in this forum are not so considerate and thoughtful.   Hopefully she will realize she's being dopey.", "I think this is just misconstrued. She is teaching you how to please her. Don't worry about the semantics around the language of rudeness or whatever, just remember that your wife is into flavor and wants a taste of everything, and act accordingly in the future. It's like a love language or something, it will be great for both of you.", "Strangers sure but husband and wife sharing nice donuts?!\n\nFelt like a wholesome couple thing.\n\nNow I feel like I want to find mochi donuts in my city and its in the middle of the night.", "NTA. It really depends on how she communicated with him. OP makes it sound like she made a big deal about it and was genuinely upset about it. I understand she\u2019s disappointed but there\u2019s no reason to get upset about. \n\nIf she has said \u201caww man I wanted to try the other ones. Next time, can you cut them in half?\u201d then that would have been N A H since she wouldn\u2019t have made a big deal.", "OP wasn\u2019t told until after he ate the donuts and next time he should just not get her anything if she is going to be ungrateful and ridiculous about her own issues. Pick up your own damn donuts.", "I honestly don\u2019t like them. Part of the appeal of a donut for me is the light and airy texture whereas mochi donuts are chewy and dense. Mochi pancakes on the other hand I love."]}
