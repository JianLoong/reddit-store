You brought her donuts, which is super considerate. NTA", "NTA She completely missed the point that there are more donuts at the store, and that next time you can buy the same 6 and eat the different ones....like you didn't get to try the flavours she was given. Sounds is selfishly projecting her gluttony on you LOL", "NTA\n\nI would be insulted if someone left me six half-eaten doughnuts. That's not a normal expectation and you can't be blamed for not considering it.", "NTA- you cut them in half and they dry out. It\u2019s rude of your wife to call someone rude for doing something nice for her. I wouldn\u2019t bother bringing the donuts home next time. \n\nMy husband doesn\u2019t do the dishes the way I do. I would never call him out for it because he does his part. My preferences are mine alone. It wouldn\u2019t be right of me to assume his preferences are worthless.", "NTA- at least you left her some", "NAH I\u2019d have felt the same way she did, that it would be better for each of you to try 6 flavors than just 3. But I also don\u2019t think you not thinking that way makes you an asshole, especially since your intent was to share.", "NTA.  This was a bonus she wasn\u2019t expecting and she still got 3.  She can go back herself next time and pick out the other ones she didn\u2019t get to try this time around.", "NTA. Should have said \u201csorry for bringing you donuts, I\u2019ll never do it again\u201d", "NTA but i\u2019m curious - was she genuinely annoyed or was this just an offhand comment that she\u2019d prefer the \u201ceat half of each next time\u201d? tbh if they\u2019re fancy donuts i can understand that, but if she was annoyed at you for not knowing she\u2019d prefer that then it\u2019s obviously unfair on you.", "NTA - what would be not polite is getting 6 donuts and eating all 6 yourself. I can understand where she is coming from but I wouldn\u2019t go as far as calling you rude for it", "NTA, why would she be upset about this? Is the donut place closing, will she never in her life be able to try the other flavors? You did something nice, the correct response is \"Thank You.\"", "NTA for not knowing she wanted 6 half-earen donuts.", "NTA I'd love for my hubby to be so thoughtful.", "NTA - It was nice of you but you didn't even have to get her any donuts.", "NTA. Do nut buy her anymore donuts", "NTA - I would have been happy if my partner just left me one donut", "This is a stupid thing for your wife to get upset about \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f no nta", "NTA Next time, don't save her anything or buy 2 of each. \ud83d\ude05", "NTA\n\nYou did a nice trying bringing home surprise donuts. \n\nAlso, you said they\u2019re mochi donuts? I assume that would mean there are fillings? Cutting them all in half would be messy.

You also didn\u2019t get to try all the flavors. Now you can go back later.", "NTA.  I\u2019d hate to what the rest of your marriage is like if she\u2019s creating issues out of your thoughtfulness.", "NTA. Next time dont buy her anything as a surprise", "NTA. I think a lot of people wouldn\u2019t think to do that. It\u2019s a good idea. She should just let up & accept you will do it next time. It\u2019s not rude to not be able to read her mind.", "Yikes, is she always like this?", "Nah but...yah you should have either cut them in half or waited for her to be there to share together", "As a donut aficionado you broke the holy donut rules (see what I did there) I would also be heartbroken if I didn\u2019t get to try all the flavors! Now go get her all the flavors you donut dream killer!", "NTA - but don\u2019t ask her for a bite of her remaining three haha", "YTA - this is a cardinal sin, your wife missed out on the taste of 3 different donuts, hope she files for divorce. This is blatant abuse, your wife is a saint to put up with you", "You can always go back. And take her with you.", "A doughnut hole in the doughnut's hole. But we must look a little closer.

I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s rude - that was harsh on her part\u2026 but my husband would 100% have known to eat half of each. NTA, but now that you know, you know. Get her more donuts.", "YTA, you should have either done what she suggested, or waited until you got home so that she could have some say in which flavours she wanted.\n\nEating half without letting her choose or try all the flavours was a little inconsiderate.\n\nI say YTA, but realistically only barely, it's not a big deal, and I don't think you were actually an arsehole, but it was a little selfish.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Next time eat all the donuts because ungrateful people do not deserve mochi goodness.", "nta wtf", "NTA. It\u2019s one thing if they\u2019re sitting out at work or you brought them all home to graze, but it\u2019s a pain to do this on the go and who wants basically leftovers her way.", "The correct response is \" awe thank you for the Donetsk i appreciate you!,\" not whatever tf this is\n\n\nNta", "YTA though not a big one. Just text or call and check next time. Communication is a big one in marriages, even for little things.", "NTA. Now that you know better, you can do better.", "NAH. Honestly, I think your mistake was not waiting until she was home so you could talk about what to do with them, but it wasn't an unreasonable way to divide them and you could always buy six of the same kind next time you go and give her the flavors she didn't get to try this time.", "NAH in my marriage there would likely have been a text discussion as to what the flavours all were and if either of us had any preferences.", "Um he committed a donut sin, he must repent with more donut flavors. This is the way.", "Um as a donut expert they do NOT dry out in a matter of hours. Must try all the flavors!", "I agree with this take. They just had different expectations. I'm with you and the wife though, it's totally better to split 6 instead of each taking 3 different flavors and missing the other 3.", "Also he needs therapy too!", "You forgot to put the /sarcasm at the end", "Also he put it here and we have read of it, so he has to get us donuts too right? Please? Heck I want a donut now!\n\nBtw OP you're NTA, I get her wanting to try them all but you had no way to know she would want you to cut them all in half. On the upside you now have an excuse to buy six more so you can each try the ones you missed first time!", "I'd be disgusted if you did eat half of each one - I definitely wouldn't be eating the other half's! lol\n\nI'm assuming this doughnut shop isn't a pop up therefore there will be other times she can try the other flavours.  You did a lovely thing bringing her whole doughnuts NTA", "This makes me want macaroons so now I'm going to the bakery tomorrow. Thank you very much Reddit.", "Let me change that for you \u201cAita for marrying an entitled wife who doesn\u2019t appreciate me?\u201d", "NTA.  People respond to incentives and your wife is training you not to do anything nice for her.  Next time buy six artisan donuts and keep them somewhere other than your house, eat three one day and three the next.", "NTA have you considered divorce?", "NTA ( but that is with the view that you didn't leave her flavours she didn't like or took all the tasty ones.)", "You know what's not polite, bitching about something nice someone did for you. Next time, just get enough for yourself to eat. You are NTA.", "Not judging. But when I do this with my friends we just cut them in half so everyone tries everything.", "My God people, how old are you two? That's some childish argument you two have. If you left halfsies she could've argued that what you did is gross.\n\nThe mature thing on her part would've been to thank you for the gesture and tell you that next time leave her the flavours she hasn't tried yet. Or simply ask you the name of the place and go herself and pick whatever flavours she wants. \n\nOn your part, if the donuts were bought specifically for her you shouldn't have touched them before her. It's like buying someone a pair of shoes and wearing them first. \n\nESH for how you both dealt with the situation.", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain and suggest YTA. \n\nThis is silly and ridiculous. But we all have silly ridiculous things that matter to us. It is part of what makes us unique. For me I get annoyed if my partner opens fresh bread from the market before we get home, infuriates me every time (which I suspect is why she does it\u2026). \n\nYou probably should have known this kind of thing mattered to your wife. And as silly as it is it\u2019s harmless. She wants to share the experience and flavours with you. Or she\u2019s a curious person and didn\u2019t want to miss out on new things. \n\nOn the upside you got to learn something new about your wife! A silly thing that matters to her. How cool is that?", "She is not the AH for wanting him to save half of each doughnut (sorry, I just couldn't spell it the American way, it felt nasty)\n\nShe's the AH for getting upset at him for some weird rule that was only in her head after he did something nice for both of them.\n\nNTA", "Doesn't it just give you an excuse to buy more though? Not that I personally think people need an excuse, but some people like to justify things in their own minds I guess."]}
