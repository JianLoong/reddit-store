He is genuinely my (40F) best friend.\nOur mother died last month, it hit L the hardest because she was his carer. She had cancer, so we had time to discuss any wishes that my mother had, one of them was that when she died I let my brother live with me, I agreed. I got an extension added on to the side of our house for my brother, so he would have his own space and I could always look out for him.\nOur family has always been close with L, he would stay with us when my mother was away. My son (11) adores him and they're always doing fun things together like sports and gaming, I also thought my daughter B(20) got along with L, they often have mario kart tournaments together and L has even convinced me and my husband to give her a bit more independence.\nTwo nights ago B came home late from a party with her friend. I always stay up when B is out to make sure she got home okay. I heard her come into the house with her friend and I heard B say \"we need to be quiet so we don't wake my r slur uncle up\". I thought my mind was playing tricks on me. Me and my husband have never raised our kids to say such things.\nThat comment just took me back to when me and L were younger and me defending him against all the horrible people that would stare and make fun of him.\nI got up out of bed and I asked my daughter to repeat what she said. I could tell from the look on her face that she didn't think I'd hear that. I asked how she could say something so cruel about her own uncle. That this is not how she was raised and at 20 she should know how awful that is, and if she thought saying that to her friend made her look cool she was wrong, that she made herself look like an insecure bully. \nShe didn't apologise, she just said that nobody was meant to hear that and it's not a big deal. I asked B's friend if her parents are okay with her having friends stay over. She said yes so I told B to leave and stay at her friend's house.  B said I'm meant to take her side, that I'm her mother, I told her I have been L's sister longer than I've been a mother. B didn't think I was serious, I've always been a calm parent and I have never told her to leave the house before. I had every intention of having B back home, but she needed to learn a lesson that I meant that behaviour would not be tolerated. I apologised to B's friend for being in the middle and I gave her cash to cover the cab to her house. \nI called B yesterday, hoping she understood how out of line she was, she didn't. She was unhappy that I took L's  side over hers. I told her to come home so we could discuss this properly but she refused. I have been in touch with her friend and B is still staying with her, so at least she's safe. \n\nMy husband said I was too harsh, but there's still that protective big sister rage in me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1696452548, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16zy7t2/aita_for_kicking_out_my_daughter_for_what_she/", "score": 2590, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's (was) her house, too. I love my family and adore spending time with them but I don't want them moving in. \n\nShe could have just been being a little shit, too.

Throwing her out In the middle of the night over what she said is not okay. What she said was serious, but as her parent you could've handled that way better than how you did.\n\nThat comment about how you were L's sister for longer than her mother just rubs me the wrong way. Why was this comment needed? To me this sounded like you were saying L is more important than your own daughter. \n\nYou needed to talk to her about her behavior not kick her out. At 20 she is no longer a child, but she is still learning. Y'all were not done teaching her once she turned 18.", "ESH. That was a crappy thing for her to say but you wildly overreacted in a way that might permanently damage your relationship with your daughter.", "Esh, your comment on knowing your brother longer was not a good comment to make.

Ground her. Take her phone. Make her cook and clean for a week. Let the punishment fit the crime. Also, just sending her friend home also addresses just how serious you were.\n\nWhen my son was in his late teens, his mom kicked him out for a week (over a way more serious thing). Many years later he confided in me how huge that was to him. Before, he always thought home was his one absolutely safe place for him where he was loved and welcome. Forbidding him to come home broke that unconditional safety that was his home.\n\nKicking out your daughter may have a similar effect - the punishment seems way to harsh for the crime.\n\nAlso, while B and your son may like L, taking on full time care of a disabled person brings huge changes to family dynamics.", "ESH your daughter for obvious reasons and you for \u201cI stay up when my adult daughter is out just to make sure she\u2019s safe\u2026 the I kick her out of the house!

And will may have continue to think its ok. Your daughter is 20, and she was mocking her uncle\u2026 yes it may sound harsh, yes you overreacted, but she may have not taken your anger seriously enough to had you just let it go. Let her sulk.

I don\u2019t understand why this is perceived as \u201cpicking sides\u201d your daughter displayed very hateful behavior to a family member who loves her and then acted like nothing was wrong. In fact I would go even further by saying she\u2019s vindictive. My mom knee jerk kicked me out when I was 18 and when she told me to come home to talk I was hurt but came back with humility for what I did wrong.

He is genuinely my (40F) best friend.\nOur mother died last month, it hit L the hardest because she was his carer. She had cancer, so we had time to discuss any wishes that my mother had, one of them was that when she died I let my brother live with me, I agreed. I got an extension added on to the side of our house for my brother, so he would have his own space and I could always look out for him.\nOur family has always been close with L, he would stay with us when my mother was away. My son (11) adores him and they're always doing fun things together like sports and gaming, I also thought my daughter B(20) got along with L, they often have mario kart tournaments together and L has even convinced me and my husband to give her a bit more independence.\nTwo nights ago B came home late from a party with her friend. I always stay up when B is out to make sure she got home okay. I heard her come into the house with her friend and I heard B say \"we need to be quiet so we don't wake my r slur uncle up\". I thought my mind was playing tricks on me. Me and my husband have never raised our kids to say such things.\nThat comment just took me back to when me and L were younger and me defending him against all the horrible people that would stare and make fun of him.\nI got up out of bed and I asked my daughter to repeat what she said. I could tell from the look on her face that she didn't think I'd hear that. I asked how she could say something so cruel about her own uncle. That this is not how she was raised and at 20 she should know how awful that is, and if she thought saying that to her friend made her look cool she was wrong, that she made herself look like an insecure bully. \nShe didn't apologise, she just said that nobody was meant to hear that and it's not a big deal. I asked B's friend if her parents are okay with her having friends stay over. She said yes so I told B to leave and stay at her friend's house.  B said I'm meant to take her side, that I'm her mother, I told her I have been L's sister longer than I've been a mother. B didn't think I was serious, I've always been a calm parent and I have never told her to leave the house before. I had every intention of having B back home, but she needed to learn a lesson that I meant that behaviour would not be tolerated. I apologised to B's friend for being in the middle and I gave her cash to cover the cab to her house. \nI called B yesterday, hoping she understood how out of line she was, she didn't. She was unhappy that I took L's  side over hers. I told her to come home so we could discuss this properly but she refused. I have been in touch with her friend and B is still staying with her, so at least she's safe. \n\nMy husband said I was too harsh, but there's still that protective big sister rage in me.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That is important to know because there are others living there, not just OP. \n\nThough more importantly, what sort of care does the brother require? If it's minimal and he's capable of bathing himself, feeding himself, going to the washroom, dressing himself, doesn't require medicine or if he does can take it himself, etc and just needs someone to generally keep an eye on him every now and again that is fine. However, if he does in fact require help with any or all those things and maybe more...who is doing the bulk of this care? The sister? Is she capable of doing that all the time or does her daughter or husband also have to help? \n\nThat is a lot to put on someone who maybe never even got a say to begin with. \n\nSo if the Uncle requires a lot more than simple care, then yeah, sometimes it is best to have them with a professional who is better equipped to care for them the way they need to be. For instance, if the Uncle requires being changed, that is not easy for some people who are close to that person to do. A professional will also give them the care and attention they require more adequately than a person who has never had to do that sort of care before. \n\nIt doesn't sound like the Uncle is necessarily that severe, but he does require living with someone so he does have needs that OP has failed to mention. So it would be really important to know the exact nature of the help he requires and who helps with those needs. Of course no one ever wants their loved ones to have to go to a home or have someone else take care of them, most people want to be able to do all of that care for said family member but it's not always that easy. It is also very easy to become frustrated and exhausted with it. \n\nAll that being said, the daughter was way out of line and it doesn't matter the type of care required, what she said was absolutely awful. She is an adult and therefore could move out if she does not want to be there. I just think that what you said is really not taking into consideration the whole picture.

People with mental disability are also capable of being a-holes, of being brats and taking advantage of the favoritism. As much as I love my brother and am protective of him, I am able to see that. I\u2019m sure I wouldn\u2019t if he was my son or my much younger brother like in your case. I think your daughter got to experience what it is like to be the younger sister of someone with a mental disability. You have conflicting feelings of love and resentment. And it\u2019s on the parents to manage that. I\u2019ve had lots of therapy to understand that those feelings did not make me a bad person, they are pretty normal for the siblings of disabled people. \n\nAnyway, your daughter probably needs therapy to sort those feelings out. I would never kick my own daughter out, no matter what came out of her mouth because I know her heart. I think YTA for not thinking about how your daughter felt growing up about your brother and the time and emotional space that he has always taken from her.

She's used to being the only person (besides her brother) that you take care of, but now there's suddenly someone else in her home occupying that role as well, someone who has an entire history with you that she doesn't know.

How often did they play video games? Was this at OP's home or her mother's? Did she ever actually ask her daughter if she even liked that game?

He argues it isn't an excuse. My reasoning is that he was told to make dinner so his mother did not have to, yet she was working on dinner. It got ugly. Shouting, more excuses. Accusations of me being a bad father. Did I mention that his mother did not want to let him move back home, but I spent a month talking her into it?\n\n\n\nAnyways, long story short... we are pausing the whole argument to let things cool, but he has been told that he will be better about his responsibilities and not argue when we get upset when he does not. He has also been told that if he does not agree, he has to find someplace else to live. His reply was that he has to live here because he cannot afford to live elsewhere. I told him I did not care. That I would start the legal process to have him removed if necessary, and if he forced me to do that, nothing would change my mind once the process was started.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll he has to do is pull his weight around the house and not disrespect me.

She isn't prone to yelling, being excessively punitive, and - most important - has *never* asked her daughter to leave the house. Why in the world would B think she'd been expelled, never to return? Not to mention, B was coming in late enough that the household was (presumably) asleep and OP called her the next day to ask her to come home and discuss the issue. Literally *less than 24 hours later* and likely far less than that! B is unlikely to be traumatized for life over that. How melodramatic everyone is being here! I really think that if B had called her uncle the \"N\" word or used a gay slur, everyone would be praising OP and would be advising her not to let that bigot come back home until she'd gotten on her knees and begged forgiveness and then went to therapy and took classes on how not to be a bigot.

It's some ableist bullshit how little anyone is reacting to what B did. ***She's a 20-year-old woman, not a child, ffs!*** She's certainly acting like one but she is well old enough to know better, old enough to apologize, and absolutely old enough to spend *ONE NIGHT* away from home as a punishment.", "If the daughter is attacking the innocent brother just bc of his disabilities then she deserves to not have her mom to back her and enable this ablist nonsense. You reddit users have never had a slur used against you and it shows", "Lol ok. It was clearly not forever, she called her 20 year old adult child in the morning.", "Part of my concern about this is that she didn't use the word in a general way, she  used it specifically to describe her own disabled uncle. The way she used it is particularly nasty.", "None of us are her daughter.  Our children take away very different messages from us their parents than they do from others.  So get out of my house followed by I loved my brother longer than I\u2019ve known you makes it all open for interpretation since kicking someone out of your house is SO EXTREME.  \n\nI read what she wrote and thought she intentionally let her daughter think she was kicked out to \u201cteach her a lesson\u201d.  Others in this thread clearly also thought that. WTF type of lesson is go have a sleep over at your friend\u2019s house?", "And in those hours in between \u2026.  How much time is it ok to let someone think they\u2019ve been kicked out?"]}
