He is genuinely my (40F) best friend.\nOur mother died last month, it hit L the hardest because she was his carer. She had cancer, so we had time to discuss any wishes that my mother had, one of them was that when she died I let my brother live with me, I agreed. I got an extension added on to the side of our house for my brother, so he would have his own space and I could always look out for him.\nOur family has always been close with L, he would stay with us when my mother was away. My son (11) adores him and they're always doing fun things together like sports and gaming, I also thought my daughter B(20) got along with L, they often have mario kart tournaments together and L has even convinced me and my husband to give her a bit more independence.\nTwo nights ago B came home late from a party with her friend. I always stay up when B is out to make sure she got home okay. I heard her come into the house with her friend and I heard B say \"we need to be quiet so we don't wake my r slur uncle up\". I thought my mind was playing tricks on me. Me and my husband have never raised our kids to say such things.\nThat comment just took me back to when me and L were younger and me defending him against all the horrible people that would stare and make fun of him.\nI got up out of bed and I asked my daughter to repeat what she said. I could tell from the look on her face that she didn't think I'd hear that. I asked how she could say something so cruel about her own uncle. That this is not how she was raised and at 20 she should know how awful that is, and if she thought saying that to her friend made her look cool she was wrong, that she made herself look like an insecure bully. \nShe didn't apologise, she just said that nobody was meant to hear that and it's not a big deal. I asked B's friend if her parents are okay with her having friends stay over. She said yes so I told B to leave and stay at her friend's house.  B said I'm meant to take her side, that I'm her mother, I told her I have been L's sister longer than I've been a mother. B didn't think I was serious, I've always been a calm parent and I have never told her to leave the house before. I had every intention of having B back home, but she needed to learn a lesson that I meant that behaviour would not be tolerated. I apologised to B's friend for being in the middle and I gave her cash to cover the cab to her house. \nI called B yesterday, hoping she understood how out of line she was, she didn't. She was unhappy that I took L's  side over hers. I told her to come home so we could discuss this properly but she refused. I have been in touch with her friend and B is still staying with her, so at least she's safe. \n\nMy husband said I was too harsh, but there's still that protective big sister rage in me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1696452548, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16zy7t2/aita_for_kicking_out_my_daughter_for_what_she/", "score": 890, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's (was) her house, too. I love my family and adore spending time with them but I don't want them moving in. \n\nShe could have just been being a little shit, too.

Throwing her out In the middle of the night over what she said is not okay. What she said was serious, but as her parent you could've handled that way better than how you did.\n\nThat comment about how you were L's sister for longer than her mother just rubs me the wrong way. Why was this comment needed? To me this sounded like you were saying L is more important than your own daughter. \n\nYou needed to talk to her about her behavior not kick her out. At 20 she is no longer a child, but she is still learning. Y'all were not done teaching her once she turned 18.", "ESH. That was a crappy thing for her to say but you wildly overreacted in a way that might permanently damage your relationship with your daughter.", "Esh, your comment on knowing your brother longer was not a good comment to make.

Ground her. Take her phone. Make her cook and clean for a week. Let the punishment fit the crime. Also, just sending her friend home also addresses just how serious you were.\n\nWhen my son was in his late teens, his mom kicked him out for a week (over a way more serious thing). Many years later he confided in me how huge that was to him. Before, he always thought home was his one absolutely safe place for him where he was loved and welcome. Forbidding him to come home broke that unconditional safety that was his home.\n\nKicking out your daughter may have a similar effect - the punishment seems way to harsh for the crime.\n\nAlso, while B and your son may like L, taking on full time care of a disabled person brings huge changes to family dynamics.", "ESH your daughter for obvious reasons and you for \u201cI stay up when my adult daughter is out just to make sure she\u2019s safe\u2026 the I kick her out of the house!

In fact I would go even further by saying she\u2019s vindictive. My mom knee jerk kicked me out when I was 18 and when she told me to come home to talk I was hurt but came back with humility for what I did wrong.

He is genuinely my (40F) best friend.\nOur mother died last month, it hit L the hardest because she was his carer. She had cancer, so we had time to discuss any wishes that my mother had, one of them was that when she died I let my brother live with me, I agreed. I got an extension added on to the side of our house for my brother, so he would have his own space and I could always look out for him.\nOur family has always been close with L, he would stay with us when my mother was away. My son (11) adores him and they're always doing fun things together like sports and gaming, I also thought my daughter B(20) got along with L, they often have mario kart tournaments together and L has even convinced me and my husband to give her a bit more independence.\nTwo nights ago B came home late from a party with her friend. I always stay up when B is out to make sure she got home okay. I heard her come into the house with her friend and I heard B say \"we need to be quiet so we don't wake my r slur uncle up\". I thought my mind was playing tricks on me. Me and my husband have never raised our kids to say such things.\nThat comment just took me back to when me and L were younger and me defending him against all the horrible people that would stare and make fun of him.\nI got up out of bed and I asked my daughter to repeat what she said. I could tell from the look on her face that she didn't think I'd hear that. I asked how she could say something so cruel about her own uncle. That this is not how she was raised and at 20 she should know how awful that is, and if she thought saying that to her friend made her look cool she was wrong, that she made herself look like an insecure bully. \nShe didn't apologise, she just said that nobody was meant to hear that and it's not a big deal. I asked B's friend if her parents are okay with her having friends stay over. She said yes so I told B to leave and stay at her friend's house.  B said I'm meant to take her side, that I'm her mother, I told her I have been L's sister longer than I've been a mother. B didn't think I was serious, I've always been a calm parent and I have never told her to leave the house before. I had every intention of having B back home, but she needed to learn a lesson that I meant that behaviour would not be tolerated. I apologised to B's friend for being in the middle and I gave her cash to cover the cab to her house. \nI called B yesterday, hoping she understood how out of line she was, she didn't. She was unhappy that I took L's  side over hers. I told her to come home so we could discuss this properly but she refused. I have been in touch with her friend and B is still staying with her, so at least she's safe. \n\nMy husband said I was too harsh, but there's still that protective big sister rage in me.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That is important to know because there are others living there, not just OP. \n\nThough more importantly, what sort of care does the brother require? If it's minimal and he's capable of bathing himself, feeding himself, going to the washroom, dressing himself, doesn't require medicine or if he does can take it himself, etc and just needs someone to generally keep an eye on him every now and again that is fine. However, if he does in fact require help with any or all those things and maybe more...who is doing the bulk of this care? The sister? Is she capable of doing that all the time or does her daughter or husband also have to help? \n\nThat is a lot to put on someone who maybe never even got a say to begin with. \n\nSo if the Uncle requires a lot more than simple care, then yeah, sometimes it is best to have them with a professional who is better equipped to care for them the way they need to be. For instance, if the Uncle requires being changed, that is not easy for some people who are close to that person to do. A professional will also give them the care and attention they require more adequately than a person who has never had to do that sort of care before. \n\nIt doesn't sound like the Uncle is necessarily that severe, but he does require living with someone so he does have needs that OP has failed to mention. So it would be really important to know the exact nature of the help he requires and who helps with those needs. Of course no one ever wants their loved ones to have to go to a home or have someone else take care of them, most people want to be able to do all of that care for said family member but it's not always that easy. It is also very easy to become frustrated and exhausted with it. \n\nAll that being said, the daughter was way out of line and it doesn't matter the type of care required, what she said was absolutely awful. She is an adult and therefore could move out if she does not want to be there. I just think that what you said is really not taking into consideration the whole picture.
