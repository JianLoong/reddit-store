Another info is I am plus size and she is a 100 pounds wet. So little comments came here and there that I was eating everything in sight.

Now I am accused of eating all the butter, drinking all of the milk, eating all of the eggs, using the detergent that 80% of the time I AM PURCHASING. \n\nAfter the last argument I lost it genuinely, I am passive for the most part because I dont care enough to sit and nickel and dime someone.

I buy it for myself and it keeps being eaten by her. I also budget very well, nearly everything is store brand and the cheapest i can buy it. I can make $40 stretch to feed me for 3 weeks on meals. I have had to eat rice and beans to pay rent before. I know how to struggle, I lost both of my parents. I dont have a financial security net, if i dont have money, im fucked.
