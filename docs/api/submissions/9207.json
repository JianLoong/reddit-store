Could you explain that a little bit better?\n\nFor contrast, here in the city of Los Angeles; it was recently legalized that homeowners could turn their garage into a separate apartment. That has the potential of two \u201cfamilies\u201d on one property. One family in the main house and then a single person or perhaps a couple in the garage unit. \n\nI could understand how that will attract a change of demographics, as it allows lower income people to move into a high priced area and also increases cars and people in that area.

They might find that they just need a room with four walls for a short bit of time before they are back in a bigger space, so renting from your neighbor is perfect. We don\u2019t know all the details and this could be beneficial for the renters, too. \n\nIMO, if they aren\u2019t hurting anybody and don\u2019t seem to be mistreated by the owner, I\u2019d keep an eye out for any signs of abuse and not say anything until something suspicious or concerning comes up.
