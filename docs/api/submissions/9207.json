The flats themselves are around 7 years old.\n\nI'm lucky enough to own my flat, and the block itself is a mixture of renters and owners. The flats are however, all leasehold.\n\nEvery flat has a similar layout. They have two beds, with a main bathroom, and one ensuite. The living room and kitchen are open plan. Each flat has two assigned parking spaces.\n\nNow in the current climate (UK based), the flats aren't selling too well despite being in a very desirable area of London. One of our neighbours who owns his flat, has therefore decided to rent it out so that he can move to a larger property. My issue is, he has decided he wants to maximise his profit and to do this he has converted the living room into a third bedroom.\n\nThis doesn't sit well with me at all and I'm pretty sure he can't legally do it. \n\nFirstly, I think it's pretty shitty to convert the living room and leave the renters with one small kitchen as the only communal space. I really don't like the idea of him maximising his profit at others expense and creating overcrowding. \n\nSecondly, this is a block full of couples and families. I'm concerned that if more and more people start doing this it changes the demographic. \n\nThen there's just the issues of having multiple people In one flat. More cars which the block doesn't have space for, more noise from the occupants etc etc.\n\nHe has managed to successfully get some renters as the rental market is booming but they haven't moved in yet. I'm very tempted to make some enquiries to the freeholder and the council about his set up, but if it is illegal (which I strongly suspect it is) then I'd not only lose this guy his renters, but he'd have to put everything back at expense. Alternatively, I could just let it go.\n\nSo WIBTA if I reported him?\n\nEdit to add: I can accept the asshole judgement, thats what I came here for...but Jesus I don't need to be reported by a concerned redditor for suicide watch you weirdos.", "created_utc": 1675618237, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ui2ji/wibta_if_i_reported_my_neighbour_for_turning_his/", "score": 705, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Could you explain that a little bit better?\n\nFor contrast, here in the city of Los Angeles; it was recently legalized that homeowners could turn their garage into a separate apartment. That has the potential of two \u201cfamilies\u201d on one property. One family in the main house and then a single person or perhaps a couple in the garage unit. \n\nI could understand how that will attract a change of demographics, as it allows lower income people to move into a high priced area and also increases cars and people in that area.

They might find that they just need a room with four walls for a short bit of time before they are back in a bigger space, so renting from your neighbor is perfect. We don\u2019t know all the details and this could be beneficial for the renters, too. \n\nIMO, if they aren\u2019t hurting anybody and don\u2019t seem to be mistreated by the owner, I\u2019d keep an eye out for any signs of abuse and not say anything until something suspicious or concerning comes up.

Additional cars is often the first sign there are more than allowed people in a flat. Let's say a 2br flat comes with two parking spaces.

The jobs in is within commuting distance off. The local schools it gives you the right to send your children too. The business like restaurant and cafes it allows patronize.

It cost a certain amount of money (probably a lot.)  The expectation therefore is that everyone else in the neighborhood also spent an equivalent amount on their properties or the people renting those properties are paying amounts that would require them to generally be in the same socioeconomic situation.  \n\nBy modifying one of the flats to accommodate more renters, this means two things.  First, each renter would be able to pay less than the going rate in that neighborhood, meaning lower income renters.  Second, each renter in that flat would be willing to live in less ideal conditions, probably meaning that they'll be spending more time outside, wandering about maybe.  Maybe getting up into other people's business instead of staying home and minding their own?  Who knows.  A possible third is that there might be an extra vehicle taking up extremely limited available parking (although I've been told that London has excellent public transportation and nobody there ever drives).  \n\nSo although some places here in the US have HOA's, which apparently everyone despises for doing exactly the sort of thing you want the council to do, you instead have the council, which from what I can gather is a government ordained HOA that's only slightly more annoying.\n\nAt the end of the day, I kinda don't care.  If you moved into an area that allows you to control what your neighbors can do, why should anyone argue when you do exactly that.  Of course, that means they can do it to you too, so you have fun with that.", "So he put up a wall to close off his kitchen in the house that he owns", "She\u2019s more worried about the 3 cars over the 2 I think honestly", "Because three independent people means 3 cars when they rent out only 2 spaces unless there\u2019s street parking", "I am sharing my experience as a landlord in which the test of whether a unit can be offered as a 2 or 3 or 4 bedroom property rests on how the deed and tax register describe the unit and not on whether there is an i formal conversion w/ bedroom furniture in the living room vs an actual partition. (A partition to an owned property would require a building license and would be reflected in updated property records.)  \n\nI own a 3 bdr.condo in a historic brownstone in Washington, DC. Just 1. I live in FL (moved to my hometown due to illness.) To address this issue- what can/should OP do if he thinks an owner of a 2bd. is renting it illegally as a 3bd. First- find the rules ASAP. Look online, call the council ASAP bc once renters are in it can be hard to remove them even if they would not legally have been allowed to move in if the situation were known ahead of time. In a regulated area like DC and it sounds like where OP lives too, you can\u2019t take a 2bed unit w/ a family room and dining room and magically rent the 2 communal rooms as extra bedrooms to increase profit (for the many reasons he noted.) It doesn\u2019t matter if the landlord just adds bedroom furniture. If it was sold as a 2 bedroom and remains taxed as one, you likely can\u2019t throw a bed in any room and call it a 3 bedroom. In DC (and FL) a bedroom must have 2 ways of ingress/egress in case of fire and a closet. So in my condo in DC, I have 2 regular bedrooms downstairs that share a bathroom. There is a shared kitchen, family room and dining area downstairs too. Upstairs, there is a loft bedroom that has a sep. entrance. It is LEGALLY listed (and taxed) as a bedroom bc it has 2 ways in/out of the room and a full closet. It also has a full bathroom but that is not the test. Again- I do agree that OP needs to look up the rules & reach out to the council ASAP (tomorrow is Monday!)Better to stop it before your property value goes down & the renters take less care than the owners thereby creating an unpleasant feeling in your own neighborhood.
