Honestly everyone in our family is kinda surprised how much their relationship has lasted because generally neither of my sister's past relationships have survived the one year mark lol. Also they're quite different regarding personalities, it's amazing they had been able to put their differences aside so far. What I mean is that my sister is very much superficial, kinda like a real life Regina George lol. He's more laid back, I actually like talking to him as we share some hobbies like skate and surf that my sister and brother doesn't really like so it's nice to have someone in the family interested in the same kinda stuff than I.\n\n Anyways, she's planning most of the wedding, she wants the wedding ceremony to be held in a bit church at our city, she picked the flowers and such. That part of the wedding is almost done, they're starting to plan the reception. And this is where the conflict comes. My sister wants to help the reception at a venue, the same one that she hosted her 18 birthday, it's a fancy place and really nice, it really suits her style. My FBIL wants to have some kind of beach reception, he thought about reserving a restaurant that's near the beach and have a party at there, something less fancy but that suits his style and that I personally like better. My sister is refusing completely to the idea, mainly because she wants to have a big and expensive wedding and the beach idea sounds too \"trashy\" for her. \n\nTwo days ago we all got together for his birthday. Then my sister wss telling us about this conflict and was actually looking for us to agree with her to prove a point to her fiance. Most family and friends agreed with her, however I think that the beachy wedding is a good idea so I told her that. Then she told me I was \"as trashy as (BILs name)\" we started arguing and then I told her she got the ceremony she wanted and she should let him pick this one thing because it's not only her wedding, it's their wedding. I also called out for acting like a bridezilla. That caused the argument to escalate, it was me, BIL and some other relatives against her and basically everyone else. Then she started crying and accused me of hating her and always being against her wishes, she also told her fiance to fuck off and marry me if he was willing to make her cry over their reception. \n\nSuddenly I'm the bad guy and my mom called me out because I know my sister has dreamed about her wedding for a long time and I should agree with her.

He \"yes, ma'am\" his fiance\u00e9 about the ceremony and then expected her to \"yes, sir\" him regarding the reception. Furthermore, he is letting his FSIL who has a crush on him (which I doubt he's not aware about) fight his battle for him. \n\nHe's not the biggest asshole in the situation (OP and her sister are, equally), but he isn't innocent. He sucks too.", "He is more likeable, my sister not so much but I hope they can have a nice marriage", "girl youre 1 in love with the groom 2 dont know if hes even helped this far uop 3. called her names too. 4 YTA. you only know some info and decided to make a choice imma give you a lil info beach weddings are hard to organize i know i was gonna plan one because i wanted to get married on the beach a place that host weddings like a castle venue is much 1 safer 2 easier to deal with. theres so much probably going on with your sister doing all the planning cause as you say FBIL is laid back which in my terms means he didnt try to get into the wedding plans but now wants to pick a spot that will be difficult and when you say on the beach i do thing ON THE BEACH not in a venue right by. i will need more info on if FBIL even tried helping with any of the plans or just wanted to pick the venue, at the end of the day i see where your sister is coming from beach weddings are overdone and a bit trashy, it also seems you guys live close to a beach, so i mean you can go celebrate at a beach millions of times but a big fancy wedding venue thats not often unless you marry new people every once in awhile or celebrate every big event you have there  also if anyone tries say \"but....\" i dont care this is all based off the info ive read and recieved and is my personal opinion i am leaning toward esh but idk tbh i dont necessarily like op", "Just keep lying to yourself, you already know why", "To quote Perks of Being a Wallflower, \u201cYou can't just sit there and put everybody's lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love.\u201d\n\nFBIL probably thinks he\u2019s being nice by giving in to the ceremony she wants.", "My exact thought. I've been reading comments from OP and just thinking ummmmm does op not realize she is also a shallow judgmental mean girl?", "I called her bridezilla after she called me trashy, childish I know but there's that. \n\nI never called her superficial or a mean girl to her face", "I don't have more info because she didn't gave it to me. I don't know how detailed his idea is, neither do I know how much has my sister already planned her reception at the venue. I imagine not so much since she was planning the ceremony and just starting planning the reception. \n\nI've been at a beachy wedding, granted it was a friend of mine getting married and neither her or her husband are as classy as my sister so it was a lot more laid back. He should completely step up and help plan the reception", "\u201cHonestly everyone in our family is kinda surprised how much their relationship has lasted because generally neither of my sister's past relationships have survived the one year mark lol.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s talk about this.  She\u2019s 27 and dating him for 2 years, which means that they met when she was 25.  Why do you think it\u2019s weird that she hadn\u2019t had a dating relationship hit the one year mark thus far?  It\u2019s not uncommon to not stay together very long if you\u2019re not the right people for each other.\n\nDH and I got married in our mid/late 30s.  For both of us, it was the second dating relationship to hit the one year mark.\n\nYour complaint only makes sense if you\u2019re trying to paint your sister in a bad light.", "It's cause you a little pick me girl that's why you want him.", "Fuckin hell I read that quote and now I have to go and do some self reflection", "Bruh O_O", "For what it\u2019s worth,my BFF is an attractive female who I never even wanted to kiss and I do not think you\u2019re crushing on your FBIL. It\u2019s amazing to me how some people just don\u2019t understand something as simple as a,heaven forbid,mixed gender friendship.", "You\u2019re being obtuse.  \u201cI don\u2019t know what this beach wedding idea is - they can work it out!\u201d  The exact problem with the \u201cbeach wedding\u201d is that feeding a hundred people on a beach, and making plans for inclement weather, is *hard*.\n\nI\u2019m guessing you know perfectly well what FBIL\u2019s idea was, and it\u2019s hare-brained.", "Your sister is right, you are trashy lol.", "I mean, you are trashy. Only trash acts like this to their sisters' fiancee.", "I don't think it's weird to have relationships that last more than a year when you're young. I've been with my ex boyfriend three whole years before breaking up. My friend (f24) got married last year and her and her husband had been dating since HS, many other people I know have had years of relationship too, and all of them are my age so quite young", "What's funny is that we're not even friends or close, but I admit someone is attractive and that suddenly means I'm jealous of my sister and I'm trying to steal her man lol, you can find other people attractive and not want to date them for whatever reason", "Right? I'm embarrassed FOR her!", "Just like the man she's marrying", "You know what else he doesn't want...you.", "Your logic skills are poor.  Your argument is that it was weird for your sister to have a relationship get to the engagement stage because her previous relationships failed before the one year mark.\n\nMy point is that it\u2019s not at all uncommon for people\u2019s dating relationships to not last all that long until the find the right person for them.\n\nYou are arguing against a straw man, pretending I think it\u2019s weird for dating relationships to last several years.  Sucks to be you, because \u201cX isn\u2019t weird\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201cNot X is weird.\u201d\n\nOnce you take a break from your fantasies about your BIL, take a logic course.", "You don't have to say it, your behavior shows it! Actions speak louder than words.", "Wow, what a clueless brat. It's very much at the root of the conflict and it's sad you dont see that.", "Probably say you\u2019re more trashy tbh :)", "You can't even say one nice thing about your own sister? How sad", "With a \u201csister\u201d like you\u2026 no wonder. Lol haha (/s in case it wasn\u2019t clear)", "That's fine", "Ah I thought you meant something else, sorry I misunderstood you then", "And the difference in tones when she writes about him and when she writes about her sister is so telling.", "She was asked a question and here you go \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you just liiiiieee\u201d", "\"Know thyself\"  is a good thing, as is copping to your character traits while being publicly roasted.\n\nI admire OP a lot more than the people downvoting her for this truthful acknowledgement.", "Actually having these thoughts is not trashy at all. It's only trashy to let them affect your behaviour. The OP should just keep away from FBIL so that the feelings can dissipate.", "You might want to begin with stopping your creeping on your FBIL. It's plain as day in your posts and comments. Your thirst is written in your own words.\n\n\ncreepy......", "Yeah, it's really sad. I feel for OP's sister having to deal with this, but I pity the heck out of OP for living her life just to spite her sister. That's so, so sad", "Ok, all your comments are just pushing back against the conclusion every commenter has reached - that you have feelings for your FBIL.\n\nBut you\u2019ve admitted to some. More importantly, your sister has picked up on it - she actually yelled about it her fianc\u00e9. And finally, your behavior appears to objective outsiders, the people on this sub, and based solely on your own subjective account, that your negative interactions with your sister are coming from your crush (or whatever) on FBIL.\nSo\u2026\nThis is the kind of situation that can cause family rifts that never get healed. Undermining your sister\u2019s relationship with her fianc\u00e9, deliberately or subconsciously, is a terrible thing to do. Everyone commenting here has pointed it out to you so now you have a choice - now that you know, you can 1) take a step back from commenting and getting in the middle of their relationship or wedding, or 2) stay in the middle until they break up or they stop talking to you and the family has to pick sides.", "But she actively asked for our opinion on beachy weddings, I could've said something else and I was meant to be tell them they should find a common ground between the traditional wedding and the beach themed one, but she insulted me", "My relationship with my sister has been this way since we both were teens, it's not recent.\n\nI won't talk about her wedding with her ever again after this"]}
