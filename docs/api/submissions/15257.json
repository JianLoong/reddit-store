Honestly everyone in our family is kinda surprised how much their relationship has lasted because generally neither of my sister's past relationships have survived the one year mark lol. Also they're quite different regarding personalities, it's amazing they had been able to put their differences aside so far. What I mean is that my sister is very much superficial, kinda like a real life Regina George lol. He's more laid back, I actually like talking to him as we share some hobbies like skate and surf that my sister and brother doesn't really like so it's nice to have someone in the family interested in the same kinda stuff than I.\n\n Anyways, she's planning most of the wedding, she wants the wedding ceremony to be held in a bit church at our city, she picked the flowers and such. That part of the wedding is almost done, they're starting to plan the reception. And this is where the conflict comes. My sister wants to help the reception at a venue, the same one that she hosted her 18 birthday, it's a fancy place and really nice, it really suits her style. My FBIL wants to have some kind of beach reception, he thought about reserving a restaurant that's near the beach and have a party at there, something less fancy but that suits his style and that I personally like better. My sister is refusing completely to the idea, mainly because she wants to have a big and expensive wedding and the beach idea sounds too \"trashy\" for her. \n\nTwo days ago we all got together for his birthday. Then my sister wss telling us about this conflict and was actually looking for us to agree with her to prove a point to her fiance. Most family and friends agreed with her, however I think that the beachy wedding is a good idea so I told her that. Then she told me I was \"as trashy as (BILs name)\" we started arguing and then I told her she got the ceremony she wanted and she should let him pick this one thing because it's not only her wedding, it's their wedding. I also called out for acting like a bridezilla. That caused the argument to escalate, it was me, BIL and some other relatives against her and basically everyone else. Then she started crying and accused me of hating her and always being against her wishes, she also told her fiance to fuck off and marry me if he was willing to make her cry over their reception. \n\nSuddenly I'm the bad guy and my mom called me out because I know my sister has dreamed about her wedding for a long time and I should agree with her.

The sister is acting my way or the highway, there is no meeting in the middle to find something they both want.\n\n  \n\n\nI'm planning my wedding and every big decision gets run past my partner. I'm not chosing my venue until I can get him to go there with me to look at it, because I fell in love with it when I saw it but I need him to be happy with it as well. A wedding should be about the TWO people involved, not just the bride.\n\n  \n\n\nBut yea OP spent a bit of time explaining how much she gets on with her future brother in law. That was not needed at all, she for sure has a crush.", "Came here to say the same: ESH except maybe BIL. Sister should consider his wants with hers, OP kinda went a bit too far.

Like I know siblings can have tough relationships but dude, harsh. And for why? Weddings are stressful. A beach reception sounds like a *nightmare* tbh. Lighting, weather (wind, water), sound, food, how many people is it? Will they hire a tent? Sounds like that would cost significantly more and be a lot more stress on her than just booking something at a venue where they have coordinators to take care of all that. Sounds like you like BIL more than your sister though, and in a weird way. I\u2019d apologise personally and try and work through this one with your sister.", "Then she shouldn't ask for my opinion don't you think?

Most of the ceremony will be set by the religious leader. They can pick the flowers, and songs, and if they want to add-in a poetry reading or something. While the ceremony is more important, it's not as big as the reception.\n\nSo this definitely feels like he was quiet on purpose as she went through those choices, all so he could then say the entire reception is now his to pick.", "Because you\u2019re not the one marrying her fianc\u00e9? Seems like a strong case of jealously to me lol", "> However I'm upset about the name calling tbh, I don't really care if the reception is at the beach or at the venue, but don't ask me for your opinion and then insult me!\n\nYou *know* she's like that.  Don't let her bait you.", "She\u2019s not a bride silla though. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to not want some flaky reception on a beach. I\u2019m sorry but have a big fancy ceremony then having the reception at a restaurant then beach IS trashy.
