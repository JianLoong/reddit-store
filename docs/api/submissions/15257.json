Honestly everyone in our family is kinda surprised how much their relationship has lasted because generally neither of my sister's past relationships have survived the one year mark lol. Also they're quite different regarding personalities, it's amazing they had been able to put their differences aside so far. What I mean is that my sister is very much superficial, kinda like a real life Regina George lol. He's more laid back, I actually like talking to him as we share some hobbies like skate and surf that my sister and brother doesn't really like so it's nice to have someone in the family interested in the same kinda stuff than I.\n\n Anyways, she's planning most of the wedding, she wants the wedding ceremony to be held in a bit church at our city, she picked the flowers and such. That part of the wedding is almost done, they're starting to plan the reception. And this is where the conflict comes. My sister wants to help the reception at a venue, the same one that she hosted her 18 birthday, it's a fancy place and really nice, it really suits her style. My FBIL wants to have some kind of beach reception, he thought about reserving a restaurant that's near the beach and have a party at there, something less fancy but that suits his style and that I personally like better. My sister is refusing completely to the idea, mainly because she wants to have a big and expensive wedding and the beach idea sounds too \"trashy\" for her. \n\nTwo days ago we all got together for his birthday. Then my sister wss telling us about this conflict and was actually looking for us to agree with her to prove a point to her fiance. Most family and friends agreed with her, however I think that the beachy wedding is a good idea so I told her that. Then she told me I was \"as trashy as (BILs name)\" we started arguing and then I told her she got the ceremony she wanted and she should let him pick this one thing because it's not only her wedding, it's their wedding. I also called out for acting like a bridezilla. That caused the argument to escalate, it was me, BIL and some other relatives against her and basically everyone else. Then she started crying and accused me of hating her and always being against her wishes, she also told her fiance to fuck off and marry me if he was willing to make her cry over their reception. \n\nSuddenly I'm the bad guy and my mom called me out because I know my sister has dreamed about her wedding for a long time and I should agree with her.

That's ok, however the reception is something they're both interested in and they both need to listen to each other and work together, that's my humble opinion on this.\n\nHowever I'm upset about the name calling tbh, I don't really care if the reception is at the beach or at the venue, but don't ask me for your opinion and then insult me!", "Uh I\u2019m certain they absolutely would not mind that lol", "It IS your fault that YOURE so terrible though.
