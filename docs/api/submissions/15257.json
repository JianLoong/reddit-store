Honestly everyone in our family is kinda surprised how much their relationship has lasted because generally neither of my sister's past relationships have survived the one year mark lol. Also they're quite different regarding personalities, it's amazing they had been able to put their differences aside so far. What I mean is that my sister is very much superficial, kinda like a real life Regina George lol. He's more laid back, I actually like talking to him as we share some hobbies like skate and surf that my sister and brother doesn't really like so it's nice to have someone in the family interested in the same kinda stuff than I.\n\n Anyways, she's planning most of the wedding, she wants the wedding ceremony to be held in a bit church at our city, she picked the flowers and such. That part of the wedding is almost done, they're starting to plan the reception. And this is where the conflict comes. My sister wants to help the reception at a venue, the same one that she hosted her 18 birthday, it's a fancy place and really nice, it really suits her style. My FBIL wants to have some kind of beach reception, he thought about reserving a restaurant that's near the beach and have a party at there, something less fancy but that suits his style and that I personally like better. My sister is refusing completely to the idea, mainly because she wants to have a big and expensive wedding and the beach idea sounds too \"trashy\" for her. \n\nTwo days ago we all got together for his birthday. Then my sister wss telling us about this conflict and was actually looking for us to agree with her to prove a point to her fiance. Most family and friends agreed with her, however I think that the beachy wedding is a good idea so I told her that. Then she told me I was \"as trashy as (BILs name)\" we started arguing and then I told her she got the ceremony she wanted and she should let him pick this one thing because it's not only her wedding, it's their wedding. I also called out for acting like a bridezilla. That caused the argument to escalate, it was me, BIL and some other relatives against her and basically everyone else. Then she started crying and accused me of hating her and always being against her wishes, she also told her fiance to fuck off and marry me if he was willing to make her cry over their reception. \n\nSuddenly I'm the bad guy and my mom called me out because I know my sister has dreamed about her wedding for a long time and I should agree with her.

If it does seem worth it, you\u2019re clear about your opinion without the added layer of sexism.", "Stop acting like a child and start acting like your age. You sound childish and immature", "ESH\n\nThe word \"bridezilla\" is both a loaded term and sexist. Best to avoid.\n\nSister is certainly displaying excessive wedding emotion, and acting like it's her wedding instead of their wedding.\n\nA good time will be had by all.", "Oh dear not going to end well", "I agree with you. ESH!", "If you want to know more details I'll answer, what else do you want to know?", "Honestly, this is bad advice. This person needs to stay far away from wedding planning, and getting into discussions about her opinions.", "No ofc I wouldn't make a move on him lol, there's plenty of other men haha", "I don't know if he had any more ideas or actually put the effort to help in the planning or not, neither of them told us about that, I do think he should do more about the wedding if he wants to be heard tho, like he let her do whatever she wanted with the ceremony because it's important for my sister (family traditions and such, he's not religious at all so he didn't mind) so my sister did all the work since she wanted the ceremony to be a certain way. That's ok, however the reception is something they're both interested in and they both need to listen to each other and work together, that's my humble opinion on this.\n\nHowever I'm upset about the name calling tbh, I don't really care if the reception is at the beach or at the venue, but don't ask me for your opinion and then insult me!", "Uh I\u2019m certain they absolutely would not mind that lol", "It IS your fault that YOURE so terrible though. You seem so hung up on the fact that your sister is superficial, Regina George, etc but don\u2019t seem to realize how shallow and awful you are", "Are the specifics of the fianc\u00e9s plan actually thought out at all or does he just kind of have a vague idea about renting out a restaurant that he wants your sister to do all the work to book, coordinate with and decorate?\n\nWhy is your sister a mean girl for being superficial but you aren\u2019t a mean girl for shit talking her to your family behind her back and constantly insulting her in your post, while also crushing on her fianc\u00e9 just because he is hers?", "You have a crush on your BIL, you are trashy", "I don't know honestly, she only told us a vague description of each of their ideas for the reception but I'm guessing they can work it out together whatever they decide? \n\nI say she's a mean girl because she was a bully in HS and never grow out of that", "Her plan has the exact venue that she has booked a large event in the past with. His is just the idea of a restaurant on the beach\u2026\n\nOk but how are you any different. You clearly shit talk her relationship with the rest of your family. Have a crush on her fianc\u00e9 who you don\u2019t even think is special but just want because he is with your sister. Think very highly of yourself and say you could get 100 men like him. And just generally insult and be rude to your sister throughout this post. All those things are classic mean girl behavior. It\u2019s literally the lesson Lindsey Lohan has to learn in the movie, she\u2019s not better than the mean girls when she acts exactly like them.", "I\u2019m just waiting for OPs next AITA when she ends up doing something that\u2019s going to ruin this marriage and cause her sister to go no contact. But you know, it\u2019s not her fault she\u2019s not like other girls\u2026 barf.\nAlso had to double check the age because I thought this was written by a teenager", "A compromise would be the best and they both should put the same effort in the wedding, that's my opinion however I'm upset because she gets to call me names just because I don't agree with her? Like she can do whatever she wants with her wedding if her fiance agrees but she shouldn't ask for opinions and then insult everyone who doesn't kiss her ass\n\nOk I'm a mean girl too, you win", "Haha you're right", "This comment screams 10 year old arguing a parent \ud83e\udd23", "Name calling is wrong. I especially think her name calling her fianc\u00e9 is wrong. But it\u2019s just hard to believe that you were calmly explaining your thoughts on the wedding in a nice and productive way and she insulted you out of nowhere, when you come off as a total mean girl in your own description of events.", "Or that Django unchained Leo's meme tbh", "Do you have a type of people you like? It's literally just that some of the things he does match some of the things I like, it's not deeper than that. I'm not in love with him and I'm not trying to steal my sister's husband what", "She told us his idea and said it was trashy, I told her that beachy weddings can be nice too, then she escalated it out of nowhere just because she thinks that as her sister I need to agree with her!", "yeah, i have types. that doesn't mean as soon as i see those boxes checked off that i'm into the person.\n\ndon't get defensive just because *you admitted* that you're into your brother in law and people can read.", "It\u2019s hard to trust that this is an accurate account of what happened. But if it is then your sister was definitely in the wrong. It just seems hard to believe that you are able to talk about your sister this way to everyone else without it reflecting in your direct interactions with her.", "I'm not into him tho", "I know how to socialize without being an asshole all the time I guess, that's what happened and I don't have a way to prove it so you either believe my word or not I guess."]}
