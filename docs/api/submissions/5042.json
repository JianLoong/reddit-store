She loves surprises, so I threw her a surprise party. I called/texted/contacted all her friends and invited them. \n\nMy daughter has been best friends with \u201cMatt\u201d (17 M) since elementary school, and they started dating 2 years ago. Matt is a really sweet boy, and he treats my daughter very well. I called Matt to tell him about the party, and he was a bit confused. He told me that he and my daughter had broken up 2 weeks ago. \n\nThat was news to me. My daughter was still going out at least twice a week, always telling me she was going out with Matt. She had even told me she was going out with Matt the night before I called Matt. I still have no idea where she\u2019s been going, and it\u2019s very concerning to me that it must be something bad because she\u2019s keeping up the ruse that she\u2019s still with Matt. Plus, she\u2019s been hanging out with some new people in the last few months. One of them is a person who my daughter used to joke about being a hard drug addict. She doesn\u2019t make those jokes anymore, but she used to make them very seriously and frequently. So that concerns me a lot.\n\nI didn\u2019t say this all to Matt. I apologized for calling him and told him to have a good day. Before I hung up, he asked if he actually could come to the party, as he really wants to talk to my daughter and she\u2019s been distant at school. \n\nAgain, Matt is a really good kid, and he\u2019s known my daughter for a long time. If she was really into something dangerous, like drugs or alcohol abuse (which sadly run in my family), talking to him might be able to help her out it. So, I told Matt he could come to the party, but he had to leave if my daughter asked him to leave. \n\nWell, the party was last week, and my daughter was surprised by all her guests. But she got really mad when she saw Matt. I saw her having an angry conversation with him, and he left shortly after that. After the party, she told me that she and Matt were broken up, and she couldn\u2019t believe he had come. I told her that I had known they were broken up, but I invited him because I thought it might be good for him to talk to her. She was livid. She called me a terrible mother, and she\u2019s been cold to me ever since. \n\nI understand how I could have hurt her, but I still don\u2019t know if I was fully in the wrong in this situation. I love her more than anything, and I really wanted to do what was best for her. I\u2019m sort of lost, so I was hoping you all could give me a judgement so I can understand this situation better.

You never invite an ex. Ever.", "YTA Are you insane? There was no way this was going to end well.", "YTA\n\nInstead of asking your daughter why they broke and asking if she was OK. You decided to invite Matt to her party?!\n\nI can't wrap my head around how you thought it was a good idea and why you thought it would good for your daughter to have him there.\n\nYou automatically took Matt's side and thought you'd make his feelings and wants (he wanted to talk to her) a priority over your daughter's.\n\nIf she didn't want to talk to him, I would 100% have my daughter's back and not invite him.\n\nDid you even consider that he did something to your daughter to cause them to break up? Doesn't sound like it.\n\nHow can you have so little disregard for your daughter, her wellbeing and her wishes?\n\nIs this a pattern for you? Is there a reason your daughter withold's information from you? I used to do that with my parents and it was because they never trusted me, they took everyone else's side and punished me when they didn't agree with the choices I made for myself.", "YTA\n\nYou invited him thinking they were dating: fine\n\nHe told you they were broken up so you assumed he wasn't coming: fine\n\nHe asked if he could come anyway: correct response? \"Let me ask my daughter if she wants you to come.\" (Edit: If it wasn't a surprise party. Since it was, then it should have just ended there.)\n\nInstead, you snuck it on her, manipulatively.\n\nThere's a lot of other things floating around this situation that are concerning and stuff, that you aren't wrong about, and should investigate more. But that was what your question was about so that's the ruling.", "If Matt hadn't told you about the break up then you wouldn't have been the a, because she didn't tell you either so it would be her fault. But you have said you were indeed informed of the break up, and you had only heard Matt's side of the story. Even if you think you know someone, there's always the chance they would do something you didn't expect, maybe Matt managed to really hurt your daughter during the break up, and seeing him again therefore really upset her. Regardless of whether he hurt her or not, springing a confrontation upon her at an event that is supposed to be positive and a happy occasion for her is not ok. This was not the time or place for them to talk out their issues even if she was informed beforehand. YTA here.", "YTA. This is exactly the kind of stuff why your daughter won\u2019t tell you anything ever again! Congratulations!", "YTA you should have checked with your daughter. You knew she would be uncomfortable with having her ex around but you invited him for your own benefit. You just ruined any chances you had of your daughter opening up to you. She is not going to trust you now.", "YTA for Inviting him after you knew they'd broken up. You have no idea why they broke up. Maybe he cheated. Maybe he tried to move too fast. Or maybe she just likes someone else. \n\nThe point is, you. Didn't. Know.", "YTA she broke up with him but you invited him anyway? What\u2019s wrong with you? What was the purpose inviting him to the party. You didn\u2019t want what\u2019s best for her, you wanted it for you. He told you they broke up but you didn\u2019t care. I would\u2019ve ended the call as soon as he said that. The wildest part is that you thought she was using drugs and alcohol, she probably didn\u2019t tell you because she knew how you would\u2019ve reacted. Just like you did in this case, stay out of your daughters business.", "YTA,\nI get thinking it would be good for them to talk but her party was not the place.  You forced it, and she was rightly passed.  \n\nAnd he basically said he wanted to come just to talk with her.  You should have talked with her first.  You need to apologize right away.", "YTA for still inviting him after you knew they had broken up. Had it been me, I wouldn't be throwing a party for a child I had discovered had been lying to my face. That would be a series of conversations", "YTA for multiple parts of this. First if you\u2019re concerned your child is involved in drugs or alcohol, you need to be a parent and talk to her and deal with it. Making it her ex boyfriends problem is insane. Also allowing him to come to confront her about their breakup at her party is awful. You need to take some parenting classes if this is how you deal with issues with your child", "Yep, YTA. \n\nHer behavior is certainly concerning and you need to address that, but her surprise party is not the place to air things out with her ex.", "YTA. Big time.\n\nWhy would it ever be a good idea to invite her ex to *her birthday party*?!?! \n\nYour concern for your daughter is totally valid. You should have talked to her about your concerns or asked Matt or her friends, but not at *her birthday party*!!!!! Damn, that was awful; I would be furious.", "I think the bigger issue is she\u2019s been lying to you that she is with Matt and clearly not. So where has she been going and with who. I would confront her that her lying put her in the situation of Matt being invited and address that.", "\u201c I love her more than anything, and I really wanted to do what was best for her.  \u201c\n\nThen why on earth didn\u2019t you talk to her when you found out and address the fact that she\u2019s been *lying* to you for months????\n\nThis makes no sense!?", "YTA you did what YOU thought was best knowing that it wasn\u2019t what your daughter would want. \n\nInstead of actually having an honest conversation with her, you used her own birthday party to manipulate her. Invite Matt to your own party if he\u2019s so great. \n\nMaybe there are issues that need to be addressed with your daughter but that doesn\u2019t mean that she and Matt getting back together will magically fix them. He might be a great guy but that doesn\u2019t automatically mean they\u2019re romantically compatible.", "YTA, You essentially cornered her into whatever conversation he was hoping to have with her at her birthday party. \n\nI get that you feel like he\u2019s a good kid and you\u2019ve got some potentially valid concerns about whatever is happening in her life right now but her party isn\u2019t the place to start figuring that out, ya know?", "You acted just as sneaky and dishonest as your daughter did by inviting Matt to her birthday in order to trap her into admitting they were broken up. \n\nIf you were a good mother you would have sat down and spoke with your daughter as an adult.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. As soon as he told you they have broken up you should have taken the invitation back. Your daughter's bday party is not a place for any confrontation. You ruined her bday and she will always remember it. \nThey broke up for just 2 weeks and not 2 years.  Teens won't tell their parents about every breakup. Some of them break up and makeup 10x a week.", "YTA. This was supposed to be her birthday party. Inviting him when you knew they were broken up was inappropriate. Clearly, you need to have a conversation with your daughter about what\u2019s going on and why she lied to you and where she\u2018s been going. Inviting her ex to her birthday party so he could talk to her instead of you being a parent and talking to her yourself is inappropriate.", "YTA, not for calling him up. That was sweet, and you didn't know. You became TA after knowing they split and Inviting him anyways. Talk to her about whats been going on. She's clearly hiding something.", "YTA.   Purposely inviting your daughter's ex was indeed an AH move.  Would have been one big surprise for her though.", "YTA - You we\u2019re fully in the wrong. You don\u2019t know everything about their relationship and when he told you they had broken up you should have apologized and withdrawn the invitation.\n\nIf you respect your daughter then you should trust that she had a reason for breaking up with him that was valid and her decision to make, not yours. Tell her that and hope she forgives you sooner rather than later.", "ESH\n\nYour daughter for lying to you about where she was. Matt for asking to come to the party as a way to blindside your daughter. And definitely you for inviting your daughters ex after he basically told you his intent was to blindside her at her party.", "Hot take but, ESH. \n\nShe sucks for lying to you. \n\nYou suck for inviting her ex-boyfriend. What did you think would happen after a pretty fresh break up? Even if they broke up on good terms, it's been 2 weeks and she clearly didn't want to interact with him based on his own words.", "I\u2019m sorry YTA.\n\nThey\u2019re practically adults and I couldn\u2019t imagine doing that to two adult friends let alone a relative. I can understand you wanting what\u2019s best for these two and  that you had good intentions, but her not telling you and it only being two weeks should have been enough to know it was a bad move. Apologize and move on.", "Soft YTA - when he said he wanted to talk to her but she was being distant at school, you should have dropped the importance if the surprise and focused on communicating with your daughter and you certainly should not have thought it was a good idea for him to bombard her for her birthday.\n\nOverall this is a situation of happenstance, but she's a teen and her communication skills are going to be all over the place. You need to take initiative when something like this is presented to you.", "YTA first, a surprise birthday party is a horrible time to have a talk, so not even sure how you rationalized that. Second, instead of being a parent and approaching your daughter to talk and figure out what is going on with her, you leave that responsibility to her 17 year old ex boyfriend", "YTA for still saying he could come, but I'd be having a serious conversation about why she's been lying to you and your concerns.", "Yta. \n\nWhy would you even think that was a good idea?  \n\nWhat would you have done if your mother bring your ex to a party for you?   Youd b pretty pissed off also.", "Ooooh YTA I can see why you thought you were helping but this fits firmly into the category of \"maternal meddling\"\n\nBetter would have been waiting till after the party and saying \"so Matt didn't come\" and taking it from there", "YTA. When you found out they broke up, you should have talked to her then. Having her ex boyfriend come to the party was not the thing to do.", "Why is it you could not just ask her what\u2019s going on in her life??? YTA", "Do you just like to cause drama! You discovered that they were broken up and invited him just to cause waves because your resentful your daughter doesn't feel she can be truthful with you..... I wonder why... It couldn't be because you're super manipulative could it.  YTA", "YTA You knew they were no longer together and chose to invite him anyway. She doesn\u2019t owe him a conversation just because you think he\u2019s a great guy.", "YTA", "Here's your problem...You daughter doesn't trust you. She's lying to you because clearly you will insert yourself into her relationships. It's fine that you called Matt being you didn't know but you crossed a major boundry by not respecting her decision to not associate with him any longer. She's almost 18 yrs old she will continue to lie to you if you don't trust her to make to make her own mistakes. Let her grow up on her own terms, be friends with who she wants to be. She was have plenty of friends that suffer from addiction...you can't control that. You'll lose you daughter if you can't come to some form of an open agreement. ESA her for lying and you for not respecting her decision to no longer be with Matt.", "YTA.\n\n\nMy mom invited my ex boyfriend (whom I hadn't spoken to since the breakup) to a dinner party witbout telling me and my dad jokes that he spent half the night making sure I wasn't going to put the serving fork through the guy's heart because I looked so pissed off.\n\nI would have absolutely lost my shit if she pulled it on my birthday.", "Completely inappropriate of you. Yta.", "YTA. If you are concerned your daughter is spending time with drug addicts, why on earth would you put the responsibility of dissuading her on a 17 year old kid?? That is specifically your job as a parent. \n\nAlso you\u2019re an AH for inviting him after you knew they broke up. Your responsibility is to your daughter, not to a \u201cnice kid\u201d. What is wrong with you?", "You set your daughter up instead of talking to her, maybe getting her side of things? Yikes, this is just cold. YTA", "YTA why the hell aren\u2019t you concerned with where the hell she\u2019s been when she\u2019s said she\u2019s with him??!", "YTA. They broke up, your daughter didn't tell you, fine. But tell him he can come to HER birthday? I agree with everyone else. You don't know why they broke up. \n\nYou decided to invite him to see if they would \"talk\" and, I imagine, start dating again. Well, now you ruined her birthday anyway.\n\nThe moment he became an ex, everything related to him is your daughter's decision.", "YTA. You allowed what could have been a fun day for her become awkward, and embarrassing by creating the space for him to corner her. She clearly needed some distance from him and you took his side without even talking to her", "YTA- even if your daughter is hanging out with people who use drugs, that's your responsibility.\n\nYou knew the two broke up, you have no idea what happened that caused the breakup. When Matt asked if he could attend the party, you should've asked your daughter or said no.", "YTA. Matt told you your daughter was avoiding him . That should have been all you needed to know. You decided a surprise was more important than your daughter\u2019s emotional state. Instead of continuing with your plans for a surprise party, you should have had a talk with your daughter, telling her you know she\u2019s lying and how you found out. Instead, you\u2019ve shown yourself to be someone who can\u2019t be trusted.", "YTA. As soon as he told you they have broken up you should have taken the invitation back. Your daughter's bday party is not a place for any confrontation. You ruined her bday and she will always remember it. \nThey broke up for just 2 weeks and not 2 years.  Teens won't tell their parents about every breakup. Some of them break up and makeup 10x a week.", "NAH. \n\nYou were completely unaware that they had split up *until* you called him to invite him. So, technically, *you didn\u2019t know.* Give your daughter some time, but don\u2019t act any differently than you usually would. Respect that she will have feelings about this that she\u2019ll need space to process. \n\nOnce the situations cooled down, sit down and talk to her. Explain it all to her exactly the way you explained in the post. Let her know that you didn\u2019t know, how it felt wrong to uninvite him after he shared the news with you, and how concerned it made you that she didn\u2019t share this herself and possibly could have been keeping other secrets. \n\nApologize to her for handling this in the way you did and let her know that you see where you went wrong even though your intentions were in the right place and let her know you won\u2019t do anything like this again but that you hope that she knows she can trust you. Just be genuine and sincere and open to her thoughts and feelings around this situation and in general, and take accountability wherever it\u2019s due. In due time she\u2019ll understand and forgive. \n\nTeenagers can be difficult around this age but as long as they feel like they have a safe space in their relationships with mom and dad, they\u2019ll be okay. You\u2019re a good mom. You evidently have a lovely relationship with your daughter, and you care very much about her safety, well being and emotions. I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll shine through to her as well even if it takes her the usual 3-5 teen business days to see that.", "I mean to be fair. If OP would have never called Matt she wouldn\u2019t have never know that her daughter has been lying about where she\u2019s been for a few weeks. Her mentioning a drug addict friend is a red flag. Let\u2019s think about this rationally for a second. If something happened to her daughter the mother would either blame Matt or call him. So if the daughter didn\u2019t want Matt around then she needs to stop involving him in her lies. Imagine if her daughter dies and the police go arrest Matt cuz she told her mom she was with Matt. Matt would be the first suspect. NTA", "NTA your daughter is lying to you about where she is going and she just turned 17. This is suspicious as hell. She\u2019s mad that she lied to you?", "YTA!!!! What a mortifying experience that must have been for her. You ruined her birthday. I don't know why you even remotely believe that YNTA in this situation, put yourself in her shoes, you have no idea why they broke up or what went on in their relationship. Unbelievable.", "YTA \n\nIf you have concerns about your daughters choice in friends it\u2019s up to you to have that conversation with her, not invite her ex boyfriend to her birthday party in the hopes that he will talk to her for you. What terrible parenting", "YTA. \n\nNothing like an intrusive mother to manipulate her almost adult daughter into believing she could trust said mother. I doubt this is your first infraction when it comes to her boundaries. And no. You don't want what's best for her. You want what you think is best for her.\n\nSend her over to r/raisedbynarcissists when she's 18 so she can air the rest of your dirty laundry. She'll find her tribe there.", "NTA.  Maybe you shouldn't have invited him but your intentions were good and you did tell him he'd have to leave if she wanted him to.  Also, SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU THEY BROKE UP!  Also it sounds like he is concerned about her too and genuinely wanted to help.  I think the bigger issue is what is going on with your daughter?", "you need to talk to Matt ASAP to find out what happened. stop thinking about the party, it's done,move away from it. As you said your daughter has been hanging out with a different group. Just check what is up. Your intuition as a mother is sending you red flags! You need to check out what is happening with your daughter.She will be eighteen next year, by then you will have no control to help her if she is on drugs.", "NTA. She couldn\u2019t tell you herself not to expect him around any more And she was sneaky about it, still going out and using his name with it. You were right to be concerned.", "YTA. No wonder your daughter didn\u2019t tell you about the breakup. It\u2019s clear she doesn\u2019t trust your enough to be open with you and this move just pushed her further away.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There's definitely something to address if she's been lying about going out with Matt, but this is a conversation for you to have with her, and not her ex. He says she's been distant and he wants to talk to her, and you've automatically connected it with the lies and hanging out with new friends, but I think you've put an (understandable) spin on it that isn't necessarily there. They broke up, so of course she's distant from his perspective, and he probably wants to talk about break-up.\n\nFinally, even if you believe he's the absolutely best person to find out what's going on and help her out, her surprise 17th birthday party is totally the wrong place for that conversation.", "ESH.

Which would also explain her hanging out with a 'bad' group of people trying to navigate that trauma on her own.\n\nAnd if you are always praising Matt and what a good boy he is, she might be afraid to tell you because you will call her a liar.    I don't care how long they have known each other, he is still a teenage boy.\n\nWhy is Matt more important to you than her?

I love the comments saying ops daughter doesn\u2019t trust mom and that\u2019s why she\u2019s been lying. Lmao What sounds like is happening is that the daughter has new friends who ex bf doesn\u2019t like and she dumped him.  Daughter is lying to mom not bc she doesn\u2019t trust her but bc she is hiding bad behavior. Mentioning a drug addict friend is a major red flag, \n\nOp, to hell with daughter being mad you invited Matt. You need to find out where she\u2019s been going the past two weeks when she says she is out with Matt. She didn\u2019t tell you they broke up bc she\u2019s using it as a cover to her real behavior bc you won\u2019t second guess if she\u2019s with Matt.  As a teen who did the same, I can tell you I was experimenting with drugs and getting high/drunk when I lied to my parents about who I was with.

Good luck.", "YTA\n\nHow, in your mind, is a 17 year old\u2019s birthday party the perfect time for the two of them to talk about their relationship?  Matt already told you that they broke up.  The end.  There was no reason for him to be there.\n\nIt would\u2019ve been one thing if you assumed he wasn\u2019t coming and he showed anyway.  Then he\u2019s violating boundaries.

So when she broke up with Matt, it's possible she didn't want to tell the mom in case the mom started trying to get them back together against the daughters wishes (like what has happened here where the mother effectively forced a confrontation). It's not like drugs were found in the daughters room or anything, and strange behavior can be reasonably attributed to going through a major breakup & then hiding it.

The daughter may have just been lying about being together with Matt still since she doesn't want her mother interrogating her on why they broke up or trying to convince her to get back with Matt when she doesn't want to.

But since she doesn't want her mother interrogating her, I guess the next step is let her go", "The girl also lied about still being in relationship with Matt and is hanging out with a guy known for being connected with drugs.

I also don't see the problem in manipulating things so her date always has to leave the table and I make sure daughter and ex sit next to each other while daughters date ends up on the complete opposite end of the table. Why is my daughter so horrible to me?!\" It's not like haven't seen that kind of situation before.\n\nOP, YTA for inviting the ex after he said they were broken up. If you have concerns for your daughter, be an adult and treat her like the adult she pretty much already is (1 year) and talk TO her about it. Don't talk at her, don't do the \"but oh Matt is so perfect blah blah\" type of thing. Sit her down and let her know your concerned and why. This is a topic, and she is at an age, that you do need to talk to her like you would talk to a friend. Do not talk to her like you are a parent that disapproves of her choices (even if you do) because it will yet you nowhere good. You say your concerns and why, let her talk and most importantly LISTEN TO HER. I have seen so many parents say they are listening to their kids, when they are really only hearing that the kid isn't doing what the parent wants and taking it as an insult. \n\nAgain, she is 17, she will be 18 in a year. This is the time in her life where the relationship starts to transition. Yes she is your child and you will always want the best for her, for her to be safe and happy. But, she is not a child anymore. She is becoming independent and starting to live her life by her own decisions, choices and beliefs. \n\nThis transition in the parent/child relationship is extremely important and can also be extremely fragile. Just remember she is more of an adult, and her own individual person than she is a child, and needs to start being treated as such.", "That's the 'other things floating around.'\n\nThe daughter wasn't upset that the mother invited him until *after* she learned that the mother *already* knew they had broken up. In fact, the daughter even explained to her mother why she was upset with Matt, that they had in fact broken up. She was prepared to admit responsibility for why he showed up.\n\nBut then the mother admitted she already knew they had broken up, and the daughter was justifiably upset about it. \"If you knew that, then why'd you do it?\" \"Because YOU didn't tell me\" is not a mature response. Hence why OP is the AH and not the daughter.\n\nThe daughter is fishy and investigation is needed as far as why those lies were told and what all is going on. There are probably other topics that she is indeed acting an AH on. Truth-telling already being one of them.\n\nBut the daughter is not to blame for Matt being at the party (which is what this ruling is on, and only that). She would have been if the mother had been uninformed. But the mother *was* informed, even if that wasn't because of the daughter. That puts the blame for Matt being at the party completely on the mother.\n\n(And Matt, of course, but he's a child, deferring to mother's judgment.

That said, he is her ex, now, they just broke up, and I totally get why that would throw her off/cause her to be upset, especially given that it was so recent. This party was for her, not for her to be forced to play nice with him. If my Mom did that to me, I\u2019d be pretty pissed as well. \n\nHindsight is 20/20, but I think a much better approach would have been, \u201cI called Matt so we could coordinate plans for your birthday, and he was confused, and told me you guys broke up a couple weeks ago.

Sure, she didn't tell you they broke up, but Matt did.  So you knew that she had no interest in seeing Matt (how good a person he is is irrelevant).  You intentionally \"played dumb\" to cause a crisis.  You have concerns about possible drug use or who she's hanging out with and you have ONE currency with her to address that: trust.

I fully respect whatever reasons you two aren't seeing one another, but what concerns me is you've been telling me for the past two weeks that's where you've been, with him.  I'll be honest, I'm concerned about that.  Here's why: when I was your age I did something pretty similar and that's how I got into drugs/alcohol/whatever.  Here's how my life unfolded from the choices I made at that time (and tell her about the bad things that happened and how much you missed out on with your bad choices).  This didn't just happen to me either.  Family member X and Y had similar paths and similar negative consequences because of it.  When I was your age, I didn't have someone to tell me how that path ended.  You're 17, and nearly 18 where you'll legally be able to make all your own choices as an adult.  Even now I understand I can't stop you from doing many things I wish you may want to.  What I'm talking about now is wisdom I wish I had.  I hope it helps you make better choices than I, Family member X, and Family member Y did.  Understand that even if some bad things have already happened, its likely early enough to unwind some of those.  I love you and just want the best for you, but also understand and respect that you are your own person.  Know that I'm here whenever you need me at any time day or night without judgment only love for you.\"\n\nYou don't get to say that now and have her believe it.  You blew it.\n\nYTA", "YTA.

You should have canceled the whole party!", "YTA  Once you found out they broke up you should have never let him come to the party.\n\n But at the same time you missed a golden opportunity when your daughter got upset with you when she found out that you did know they broke up. You should have pointed out to her that maybe if she hadn't lied to you repeatedly when she was leaving the house by telling you that she was going out with Matt maybe none of this would have happened. You aren't the only bad guy here...

I would have told her if she plays stupid games then she wins stupid prizes.\n\nThe problem is that you are concerned about drugs and or alcohol and are handling it by springing her ex on her.  You can't deal with a problem like this by having one of her peers talk to her.", "I'll prob get downvoted for this, but NTA\n\nI'm not saying that inviting Matt was a good decision, but I get where OP's coming from. They've known each other for many years, they were friends before they dated and seeing as the daughter has been lying weeks and OP is worried about who she hangs out with and that she might be using drugs and alcohol. She thinks that if daughter is lying to her without any prompting, she might double down on the lies if confronted. She thinks that Matt might have a better chance of talking to daughter and maybe help OP figure out what's going on and if daughter is in trouble so she could help her.\n\nFor me (and the way I read this post) she's doing all of this out of love and concern and genuine attempt to find out what's going out with her daughter. \n\nLet's not forget, parents aren't perfect and sometimes there aren't good options. We can't deem them AHs every time they make an unwise decision if that decision is genuinely made with the kid's best interest in mind and from lack of other good options at the time.", ">My daughter was still going out at least twice a week, always telling me she was going out with Matt.

What you did was incredibly manipulative and you only lost her trust, so now she is going to keep lying to you more. \n\nAlso, there's a good chance none of your suspicions are correct. She may just be heartbroken over Matt and wasn't ready to talk about it. As far as the drug addict jokes, she may no longer be friends with this person. Maybe she realized that this person's problems were not something to joke about, or maybe that person is into drugs again (read: they are, not her) and it is causing strain on her & their relationship. Or a million other things. \n\nAlso, if she did get into drugs explain to me how \"talking to Matt\" would help? Especially if they just broke up? If anything, that heartbreak or the desire to spite the both of you would only fuel such behaviors. Also if you don't know if your own daughter is drinking or doing drugs, you sure as hell don't know if Matt is into that stuff too. A lot of times, the really \"good kids\", the ones the parents love, are the absolute worst ones because they can get away with it. Not to mention, you should have more trust in your own daughter than her ex boyfriend. \n\nTry to talk to her- openly, honestly, empathetically, and calmly. Do not make accusations or speculate, especially about drugs or other such behaviors. Ask her what happened with Matt, what's going on with her, and how she is doing. If you are lucky enough to get the truth, do not punish her for her honesty, but support her.  Firmly (not aggressively) explain the damage of such things, try to figure out why she feels the need to do those things, and get her the help she needs. If she won't talk to you, get her a therapist. \n\nI played this game with my mom in high school, I would lie, she would try to catch me in it, and I would lie more. She never asked me genuinely what was going on and the few times I tried to tell her I was ignored or got in trouble. It took years to rebuild our relationship and I still don't tell her most things because I can't fully trust her.", "ESH\n\nDid you confront your daughter about her lying to you about her whereabouts?", "YTA. If you're worried about your daughter then YOU need to talk to her, not her ex boyfriend. I don't know why you thought that would be the most effective solution to find out what's going on in her life rather than communicating directly. What's more, because you didn't ask about the breakup, you have no way of knowing the circumstances. You assume Matt is a nice kid; that may not be the case. Are you comfortable with the possibility of enabling a stalker? Because that's what happens when you meddle in your child's romantic relationships/breakups when you have half the story.", "Same. OP knew that the daughter didnt want to talk to the ex. The ex said so. Why would you give the ex the opportunity to ruin the birthday with this kind of drama?", "only him", "NTA, having broken up with someone does not automatically constitute their being any issues with seeing one and another. Your daughter could have just told him to go home after seeing him and you knowing they broke up does not negate the fact that your daughter was lying to you, she is more of an asshole imo. \n\nYou are worried, rightfully so, hope things get better.", "My mother constantly shoved my ex down my throat because he was \u201csuch a good boy\u201d and he and I \u201chad so much history\u201d and she \u201cconsidered him her son in law\u201d. \n\nNever mind the constant verbal and emotional abuse he subjected me to, and all the manipulation, which she was unaware of. Mother knows best, right? I was also the same age as your daughter and my mother continued this nonsense until I was 21. It was traumatizing.\n\nYTA don\u2019t be like my mom \n\nAlso, serious question, think back to any of your exes; has someone springing them on you without your consent ever been \u201cgood\u201d for you? Seriously, ask yourself that.", "YTA. So what...? You think your child's life is some reality show now? In what universe does anyone want to see their recent ex at their BIRTHDAY PARTY. He  *told* you that she was avoiding him. That is typically indicative of not wanting to see someone, and you ignore that basic common sense?!?!? What if they'd have broken up because he was abusive, and literally just brought him back in her circle?? The truth sounds like you romanticized their relationship for a myriad of not terrible reasons, were disappointed it didn't work and tried to stage a reconciliation. Frankly it is weird being this intrusive into your almost adult child's romantic life. Back off and apologize.", "You're going to have to give your daughter the benefit of doubt, there's no signs that she's doing wrong (drugs etc). Her life path just changed &; she's evolving into the person she will become. Her ex was wrong for putting you in that position", "And what does that have to do with inviting her ex into her party. Yanno, instead of talking with her and finding out what's going on with her without ruining her birthday.", "This sub is weirdly anti-male.\n\nMan defends wife against mom - \"Omg why didn't you stand up for the woman who gave birth to you??\"\n\nMan defends mom against wife - \"lol you're such a Mama's boy\".", "Correct answer is not inviting him to the party just to hash things out. That's horrible timing. If she felt so compelled, which was still wrong, she could have told him to stop by after the party. Op should overall just have talked with her daughter to see what's going on with her.", "True, but sometimes we don't make the best decisions.", "YTA for throwing a birthday party for your kid who is repeatedly lying to you. As soon as you found out about the suspicious behavior, party should have been put on hold to address the issues. \n\nThe discussion could have been something like this: \"So I was in the process of planning a surprise party for you when I found out you and Matt aren't together. Where have you been going when you said you were with Matt. And why have you been lying about it?\"", "She shouldn\u2019t have invited the ex boyfriend after he told her they had broken up. She should have talked to the daughter and asked her why she was lying about going out with him when she wasn\u2019t. The daughter may be giving her the silent treatment but she should ground her for lying.", "All of the above", "But wait, didn\u2019t you see at the end? OP said she was only doing what was in her daughters best interest! /s. \n\nI swear to god the crap some parents pull and expect to paper over it with \u201cbut I only want what\u2019s best!\u201d No sweetie\u2026 that\u2019s just a mantra you repeat to get yourself out of reflexive thinking.", "Also reminder that you have NO idea what Matt did and he obviously can't take NO for an answer which SHOULD concern you. My mom always asked about / wondered why I wasn't still with some of my absolute garbage boyfriends bc they were charistmatic and handsome but terrible people (example: one of them slashed my bike tires while we were still dating, he was my mom's favorite and she had no idea)", "YTA. That was just a dick move. You don\u2019t get to just invite people into her life that she doesn\u2019t want there. That\u2019s controlling behavior. The path to hell is paved with good intentions.", "NTA your daughter has been lying to you for weeks about who she was seeing!", "ESH. Matt could've kept his ass home, you could've said no, and holy shit your daughter is creating potential '90s Lifetime movie of the week set ups for herself and you all.", "YTA Stop meddling in your 17 year old daughters dating life. She probably always like this person she joked about, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have talked about them, also it was obviously a joke no teenager is dumb enough to actually talk about a real drug addict to their parents. You should apologise to her and tell her you\u2019ll always back her, you were just confused, which you clearly were given what you wrote in your post.", "\"I told her that I had known they were broken up, but I invited him because I thought it might be good for him to talk to her.

She called me a terrible mother, and she\u2019s been cold to me ever since.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe is right: You ARE a terrible mother, and an AH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt her age, she should set her own guest list. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPushing her ex at her ruined her birthday party. How did you expect that to work out? A party is for celebrting, NPOT for tedious talks with an ex she does not want to see any more. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu priorized her ex over your own daughter. And it ruined YOUR relationship with her. It will be hard for you to get oveer that ... she now KNOWS she can not trust you, because you don't have her back.  STOP MEDDLING in her relationships.", "INFO- If you're really concerned about your daughter, then why don't YOU talk to her?", "Op DID know that daughter didn't want to talk to him, and invited him on purpose so she would have to anyway. That's pretty F'ed up.", "I agree with you. Initially (even though it's definitely the wrong move), I agreed with OP inviting the ex, since OP's daughter has been lying to her. Easy way to catch daughter in a lie.\n\nBut the justification for it is suuuuuper suspect. \"He's a good kid, maybe he could talk to her\"???? Um.... that's your job as a parent. Daughter didn't even **tell you** that she wasn't dating him anymore, and has been lying to you. Even if it's because she's fallen in with a hard crowd and the ex is 100% innocent, why the fuck would you risk it if that's not the case? What if daughter was lying because the ex was abusive in some way, and the daughter was lying as a way of coping? Obviously that's a bit of a stretch, but why would you want someone your daughter doesn't want to be involved with, who is also a child, to try and fix this problem for you?\n\nOP is utterly baffling.", "The girl likerly did not tell her mom because she knew her mom would be an AH and push er ex at her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: At 17, there is no need to tell every detail of your love life to your parents.", "I disagree that i am removing her agency or choice. Just the opposite.  If my daughter wanted to/wants to interact with him, she could/ can.\n\n  I would not invite him because it would not be my place to invite him knowing they are not together.  I am not going to be dragged into drama, especially at a surprise party. \n\nIn short,  I would let my daughter handle her business unless she comes to me."]}
