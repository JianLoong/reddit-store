She loves surprises, so I threw her a surprise party. I called/texted/contacted all her friends and invited them. \n\nMy daughter has been best friends with \u201cMatt\u201d (17 M) since elementary school, and they started dating 2 years ago. Matt is a really sweet boy, and he treats my daughter very well. I called Matt to tell him about the party, and he was a bit confused. He told me that he and my daughter had broken up 2 weeks ago. \n\nThat was news to me. My daughter was still going out at least twice a week, always telling me she was going out with Matt. She had even told me she was going out with Matt the night before I called Matt. I still have no idea where she\u2019s been going, and it\u2019s very concerning to me that it must be something bad because she\u2019s keeping up the ruse that she\u2019s still with Matt. Plus, she\u2019s been hanging out with some new people in the last few months. One of them is a person who my daughter used to joke about being a hard drug addict. She doesn\u2019t make those jokes anymore, but she used to make them very seriously and frequently. So that concerns me a lot.\n\nI didn\u2019t say this all to Matt. I apologized for calling him and told him to have a good day. Before I hung up, he asked if he actually could come to the party, as he really wants to talk to my daughter and she\u2019s been distant at school. \n\nAgain, Matt is a really good kid, and he\u2019s known my daughter for a long time. If she was really into something dangerous, like drugs or alcohol abuse (which sadly run in my family), talking to him might be able to help her out it. So, I told Matt he could come to the party, but he had to leave if my daughter asked him to leave. \n\nWell, the party was last week, and my daughter was surprised by all her guests. But she got really mad when she saw Matt. I saw her having an angry conversation with him, and he left shortly after that. After the party, she told me that she and Matt were broken up, and she couldn\u2019t believe he had come. I told her that I had known they were broken up, but I invited him because I thought it might be good for him to talk to her. She was livid. She called me a terrible mother, and she\u2019s been cold to me ever since. \n\nI understand how I could have hurt her, but I still don\u2019t know if I was fully in the wrong in this situation. I love her more than anything, and I really wanted to do what was best for her. I\u2019m sort of lost, so I was hoping you all could give me a judgement so I can understand this situation better.

You never invite an ex. Ever.", "YTA Are you insane? There was no way this was going to end well.", "YTA\n\nInstead of asking your daughter why they broke and asking if she was OK. You decided to invite Matt to her party?!\n\nI can't wrap my head around how you thought it was a good idea and why you thought it would good for your daughter to have him there.\n\nYou automatically took Matt's side and thought you'd make his feelings and wants (he wanted to talk to her) a priority over your daughter's.\n\nIf she didn't want to talk to him, I would 100% have my daughter's back and not invite him.\n\nDid you even consider that he did something to your daughter to cause them to break up? Doesn't sound like it.\n\nHow can you have so little disregard for your daughter, her wellbeing and her wishes?\n\nIs this a pattern for you? Is there a reason your daughter withold's information from you? I used to do that with my parents and it was because they never trusted me, they took everyone else's side and punished me when they didn't agree with the choices I made for myself.", "YTA\n\nYou invited him thinking they were dating: fine\n\nHe told you they were broken up so you assumed he wasn't coming: fine\n\nHe asked if he could come anyway: correct response? \"Let me ask my daughter if she wants you to come.\" (Edit: If it wasn't a surprise party. Since it was, then it should have just ended there.)\n\nInstead, you snuck it on her, manipulatively.\n\nThere's a lot of other things floating around this situation that are concerning and stuff, that you aren't wrong about, and should investigate more. But that was what your question was about so that's the ruling.", "If Matt hadn't told you about the break up then you wouldn't have been the a, because she didn't tell you either so it would be her fault. But you have said you were indeed informed of the break up, and you had only heard Matt's side of the story. Even if you think you know someone, there's always the chance they would do something you didn't expect, maybe Matt managed to really hurt your daughter during the break up, and seeing him again therefore really upset her. Regardless of whether he hurt her or not, springing a confrontation upon her at an event that is supposed to be positive and a happy occasion for her is not ok. This was not the time or place for them to talk out their issues even if she was informed beforehand. YTA here.", "YTA. This is exactly the kind of stuff why your daughter won\u2019t tell you anything ever again! Congratulations!", "YTA you should have checked with your daughter. You knew she would be uncomfortable with having her ex around but you invited him for your own benefit. You just ruined any chances you had of your daughter opening up to you. She is not going to trust you now.", "YTA for Inviting him after you knew they'd broken up. You have no idea why they broke up. Maybe he cheated. Maybe he tried to move too fast. Or maybe she just likes someone else. \n\nThe point is, you. Didn't. Know.", "YTA she broke up with him but you invited him anyway? What\u2019s wrong with you? What was the purpose inviting him to the party. You didn\u2019t want what\u2019s best for her, you wanted it for you. He told you they broke up but you didn\u2019t care. I would\u2019ve ended the call as soon as he said that. The wildest part is that you thought she was using drugs and alcohol, she probably didn\u2019t tell you because she knew how you would\u2019ve reacted. Just like you did in this case, stay out of your daughters business.", "YTA,\nI get thinking it would be good for them to talk but her party was not the place.  You forced it, and she was rightly passed.  \n\nAnd he basically said he wanted to come just to talk with her.  You should have talked with her first.  You need to apologize right away.", "YTA for still inviting him after you knew they had broken up. Had it been me, I wouldn't be throwing a party for a child I had discovered had been lying to my face. That would be a series of conversations", "YTA for multiple parts of this. First if you\u2019re concerned your child is involved in drugs or alcohol, you need to be a parent and talk to her and deal with it. Making it her ex boyfriends problem is insane. Also allowing him to come to confront her about their breakup at her party is awful. You need to take some parenting classes if this is how you deal with issues with your child", "Yep, YTA. \n\nHer behavior is certainly concerning and you need to address that, but her surprise party is not the place to air things out with her ex.", "YTA. Big time.\n\nWhy would it ever be a good idea to invite her ex to *her birthday party*?!?! \n\nYour concern for your daughter is totally valid. You should have talked to her about your concerns or asked Matt or her friends, but not at *her birthday party*!!!!! Damn, that was awful; I would be furious.", "I think the bigger issue is she\u2019s been lying to you that she is with Matt and clearly not. So where has she been going and with who. I would confront her that her lying put her in the situation of Matt being invited and address that.", "\u201c I love her more than anything, and I really wanted to do what was best for her.  \u201c\n\nThen why on earth didn\u2019t you talk to her when you found out and address the fact that she\u2019s been *lying* to you for months????\n\nThis makes no sense!?", "YTA you did what YOU thought was best knowing that it wasn\u2019t what your daughter would want. \n\nInstead of actually having an honest conversation with her, you used her own birthday party to manipulate her. Invite Matt to your own party if he\u2019s so great. \n\nMaybe there are issues that need to be addressed with your daughter but that doesn\u2019t mean that she and Matt getting back together will magically fix them. He might be a great guy but that doesn\u2019t automatically mean they\u2019re romantically compatible.", "YTA, You essentially cornered her into whatever conversation he was hoping to have with her at her birthday party. \n\nI get that you feel like he\u2019s a good kid and you\u2019ve got some potentially valid concerns about whatever is happening in her life right now but her party isn\u2019t the place to start figuring that out, ya know?", "You acted just as sneaky and dishonest as your daughter did by inviting Matt to her birthday in order to trap her into admitting they were broken up. \n\nIf you were a good mother you would have sat down and spoke with your daughter as an adult.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. As soon as he told you they have broken up you should have taken the invitation back. Your daughter's bday party is not a place for any confrontation. You ruined her bday and she will always remember it. \nThey broke up for just 2 weeks and not 2 years.  Teens won't tell their parents about every breakup. Some of them break up and makeup 10x a week.", "YTA. This was supposed to be her birthday party. Inviting him when you knew they were broken up was inappropriate. Clearly, you need to have a conversation with your daughter about what\u2019s going on and why she lied to you and where she\u2018s been going. Inviting her ex to her birthday party so he could talk to her instead of you being a parent and talking to her yourself is inappropriate.", "YTA, not for calling him up. That was sweet, and you didn't know. You became TA after knowing they split and Inviting him anyways. Talk to her about whats been going on. She's clearly hiding something.", "YTA.   Purposely inviting your daughter's ex was indeed an AH move.  Would have been one big surprise for her though.", "YTA - You we\u2019re fully in the wrong. You don\u2019t know everything about their relationship and when he told you they had broken up you should have apologized and withdrawn the invitation.\n\nIf you respect your daughter then you should trust that she had a reason for breaking up with him that was valid and her decision to make, not yours. Tell her that and hope she forgives you sooner rather than later.", "ESH\n\nYour daughter for lying to you about where she was. Matt for asking to come to the party as a way to blindside your daughter. And definitely you for inviting your daughters ex after he basically told you his intent was to blindside her at her party.", "Hot take but, ESH. \n\nShe sucks for lying to you. \n\nYou suck for inviting her ex-boyfriend. What did you think would happen after a pretty fresh break up? Even if they broke up on good terms, it's been 2 weeks and she clearly didn't want to interact with him based on his own words.", "I\u2019m sorry YTA.\n\nThey\u2019re practically adults and I couldn\u2019t imagine doing that to two adult friends let alone a relative. I can understand you wanting what\u2019s best for these two and  that you had good intentions, but her not telling you and it only being two weeks should have been enough to know it was a bad move. Apologize and move on.", "Soft YTA - when he said he wanted to talk to her but she was being distant at school, you should have dropped the importance if the surprise and focused on communicating with your daughter and you certainly should not have thought it was a good idea for him to bombard her for her birthday.\n\nOverall this is a situation of happenstance, but she's a teen and her communication skills are going to be all over the place. You need to take initiative when something like this is presented to you.", "YTA first, a surprise birthday party is a horrible time to have a talk, so not even sure how you rationalized that. Second, instead of being a parent and approaching your daughter to talk and figure out what is going on with her, you leave that responsibility to her 17 year old ex boyfriend", "YTA for still saying he could come, but I'd be having a serious conversation about why she's been lying to you and your concerns.", "Yta. \n\nWhy would you even think that was a good idea?  \n\nWhat would you have done if your mother bring your ex to a party for you?   Youd b pretty pissed off also.", "Ooooh YTA I can see why you thought you were helping but this fits firmly into the category of \"maternal meddling\"\n\nBetter would have been waiting till after the party and saying \"so Matt didn't come\" and taking it from there", "YTA. When you found out they broke up, you should have talked to her then. Having her ex boyfriend come to the party was not the thing to do.", "Why is it you could not just ask her what\u2019s going on in her life??? YTA", "Do you just like to cause drama! You discovered that they were broken up and invited him just to cause waves because your resentful your daughter doesn't feel she can be truthful with you..... I wonder why... It couldn't be because you're super manipulative could it.  YTA", "YTA You knew they were no longer together and chose to invite him anyway. She doesn\u2019t owe him a conversation just because you think he\u2019s a great guy.", "YTA", "Here's your problem...You daughter doesn't trust you. She's lying to you because clearly you will insert yourself into her relationships. It's fine that you called Matt being you didn't know but you crossed a major boundry by not respecting her decision to not associate with him any longer. She's almost 18 yrs old she will continue to lie to you if you don't trust her to make to make her own mistakes. Let her grow up on her own terms, be friends with who she wants to be. She was have plenty of friends that suffer from addiction...you can't control that. You'll lose you daughter if you can't come to some form of an open agreement. ESA her for lying and you for not respecting her decision to no longer be with Matt.", "YTA.\n\n\nMy mom invited my ex boyfriend (whom I hadn't spoken to since the breakup) to a dinner party witbout telling me and my dad jokes that he spent half the night making sure I wasn't going to put the serving fork through the guy's heart because I looked so pissed off.\n\nI would have absolutely lost my shit if she pulled it on my birthday.", "Completely inappropriate of you. Yta.", "YTA. If you are concerned your daughter is spending time with drug addicts, why on earth would you put the responsibility of dissuading her on a 17 year old kid?? That is specifically your job as a parent. \n\nAlso you\u2019re an AH for inviting him after you knew they broke up. Your responsibility is to your daughter, not to a \u201cnice kid\u201d. What is wrong with you?", "You set your daughter up instead of talking to her, maybe getting her side of things? Yikes, this is just cold. YTA", "YTA why the hell aren\u2019t you concerned with where the hell she\u2019s been when she\u2019s said she\u2019s with him??!", "YTA. They broke up, your daughter didn't tell you, fine. But tell him he can come to HER birthday? I agree with everyone else. You don't know why they broke up. \n\nYou decided to invite him to see if they would \"talk\" and, I imagine, start dating again. Well, now you ruined her birthday anyway.\n\nThe moment he became an ex, everything related to him is your daughter's decision.", "YTA. You allowed what could have been a fun day for her become awkward, and embarrassing by creating the space for him to corner her. She clearly needed some distance from him and you took his side without even talking to her", "YTA- even if your daughter is hanging out with people who use drugs, that's your responsibility.\n\nYou knew the two broke up, you have no idea what happened that caused the breakup. When Matt asked if he could attend the party, you should've asked your daughter or said no.", "YTA. Matt told you your daughter was avoiding him . That should have been all you needed to know. You decided a surprise was more important than your daughter\u2019s emotional state. Instead of continuing with your plans for a surprise party, you should have had a talk with your daughter, telling her you know she\u2019s lying and how you found out. Instead, you\u2019ve shown yourself to be someone who can\u2019t be trusted.", "YTA. As soon as he told you they have broken up you should have taken the invitation back. Your daughter's bday party is not a place for any confrontation. You ruined her bday and she will always remember it. \nThey broke up for just 2 weeks and not 2 years.  Teens won't tell their parents about every breakup. Some of them break up and makeup 10x a week.", "NAH. \n\nYou were completely unaware that they had split up *until* you called him to invite him. So, technically, *you didn\u2019t know.* Give your daughter some time, but don\u2019t act any differently than you usually would. Respect that she will have feelings about this that she\u2019ll need space to process. \n\nOnce the situations cooled down, sit down and talk to her. Explain it all to her exactly the way you explained in the post. Let her know that you didn\u2019t know, how it felt wrong to uninvite him after he shared the news with you, and how concerned it made you that she didn\u2019t share this herself and possibly could have been keeping other secrets. \n\nApologize to her for handling this in the way you did and let her know that you see where you went wrong even though your intentions were in the right place and let her know you won\u2019t do anything like this again but that you hope that she knows she can trust you. Just be genuine and sincere and open to her thoughts and feelings around this situation and in general, and take accountability wherever it\u2019s due. In due time she\u2019ll understand and forgive. \n\nTeenagers can be difficult around this age but as long as they feel like they have a safe space in their relationships with mom and dad, they\u2019ll be okay. You\u2019re a good mom. You evidently have a lovely relationship with your daughter, and you care very much about her safety, well being and emotions. I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll shine through to her as well even if it takes her the usual 3-5 teen business days to see that.", "I mean to be fair. If OP would have never called Matt she wouldn\u2019t have never know that her daughter has been lying about where she\u2019s been for a few weeks. Her mentioning a drug addict friend is a red flag. Let\u2019s think about this rationally for a second. If something happened to her daughter the mother would either blame Matt or call him. So if the daughter didn\u2019t want Matt around then she needs to stop involving him in her lies. Imagine if her daughter dies and the police go arrest Matt cuz she told her mom she was with Matt. Matt would be the first suspect. NTA", "NTA your daughter is lying to you about where she is going and she just turned 17. This is suspicious as hell. She\u2019s mad that she lied to you?", "YTA!!!! What a mortifying experience that must have been for her. You ruined her birthday. I don't know why you even remotely believe that YNTA in this situation, put yourself in her shoes, you have no idea why they broke up or what went on in their relationship. Unbelievable.", "YTA \n\nIf you have concerns about your daughters choice in friends it\u2019s up to you to have that conversation with her, not invite her ex boyfriend to her birthday party in the hopes that he will talk to her for you. What terrible parenting", "YTA. \n\nNothing like an intrusive mother to manipulate her almost adult daughter into believing she could trust said mother. I doubt this is your first infraction when it comes to her boundaries. And no. You don't want what's best for her. You want what you think is best for her.\n\nSend her over to r/raisedbynarcissists when she's 18 so she can air the rest of your dirty laundry. She'll find her tribe there.", "NTA.  Maybe you shouldn't have invited him but your intentions were good and you did tell him he'd have to leave if she wanted him to.  Also, SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU THEY BROKE UP!  Also it sounds like he is concerned about her too and genuinely wanted to help.  I think the bigger issue is what is going on with your daughter?", "you need to talk to Matt ASAP to find out what happened. stop thinking about the party, it's done,move away from it. As you said your daughter has been hanging out with a different group. Just check what is up. Your intuition as a mother is sending you red flags! You need to check out what is happening with your daughter.She will be eighteen next year, by then you will have no control to help her if she is on drugs.", "NTA. She couldn\u2019t tell you herself not to expect him around any more And she was sneaky about it, still going out and using his name with it. You were right to be concerned.", "YTA. No wonder your daughter didn\u2019t tell you about the breakup. It\u2019s clear she doesn\u2019t trust your enough to be open with you and this move just pushed her further away.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There's definitely something to address if she's been lying about going out with Matt, but this is a conversation for you to have with her, and not her ex. He says she's been distant and he wants to talk to her, and you've automatically connected it with the lies and hanging out with new friends, but I think you've put an (understandable) spin on it that isn't necessarily there. They broke up, so of course she's distant from his perspective, and he probably wants to talk about break-up.\n\nFinally, even if you believe he's the absolutely best person to find out what's going on and help her out, her surprise 17th birthday party is totally the wrong place for that conversation.", "ESH.

Which would also explain her hanging out with a 'bad' group of people trying to navigate that trauma on her own.\n\nAnd if you are always praising Matt and what a good boy he is, she might be afraid to tell you because you will call her a liar.    I don't care how long they have known each other, he is still a teenage boy.\n\nWhy is Matt more important to you than her?

I love the comments saying ops daughter doesn\u2019t trust mom and that\u2019s why she\u2019s been lying. Lmao What sounds like is happening is that the daughter has new friends who ex bf doesn\u2019t like and she dumped him.  Daughter is lying to mom not bc she doesn\u2019t trust her but bc she is hiding bad behavior. Mentioning a drug addict friend is a major red flag, \n\nOp, to hell with daughter being mad you invited Matt. You need to find out where she\u2019s been going the past two weeks when she says she is out with Matt. She didn\u2019t tell you they broke up bc she\u2019s using it as a cover to her real behavior bc you won\u2019t second guess if she\u2019s with Matt.  As a teen who did the same, I can tell you I was experimenting with drugs and getting high/drunk when I lied to my parents about who I was with. At 17, 2 ppl in my friend group were already doing heroin. I thankfully wasn\u2019t dumb enough to try it but I was smoking weed and doing coke and drinking. Good luck.", "YTA\n\nHow, in your mind, is a 17 year old\u2019s birthday party the perfect time for the two of them to talk about their relationship?  Matt already told you that they broke up.  The end.  There was no reason for him to be there.\n\nIt would\u2019ve been one thing if you assumed he wasn\u2019t coming and he showed anyway.  Then he\u2019s violating boundaries.  But when he asked if he could come, you should have said no.", "You weren't TA when you didn't know they'd broken up. You became one the second you found it out. \n\nIf she's not talking to him at school, she has her reasons.  She's not discussed that with you and she has her reasons for that, as well. \n\nYour concerns surrounding her behavior are valid, but that's your responsibility to discuss with her, not to use him as your spy.\n\nYTA and you need to apologize to your daughter.", "YTA. Nobody wants to have an ex sprung at them. No one like ever. You invited him because YOU wanted him there, not because you thought she would.", "YTA, have you considered I know this is going to sound strange but just talking to your daughter instead of this ruse? She's definitely not going to confide in you now", "YTA. When you called to invite him he told you they were broken up. That should\u2019ve been the end of it. Instead you decided to be manipulative.", "You have a weird way of staging an intervention if you thought your daughter was doing drugs. \n\nYou have no clue why they broke up. Instead of asking her, you invited him to a night that was supposed to be about her. Not at all how birthday surprises are supposed to work. \n\nTalk to your daughter. Ask her why they broke up. In the future, don\u2019t invite her ex (even if he\u2019s \u201ca really sweet boy\u201d) to anything without her consent. If you are worried about her new friends TALK TO HER. I can\u2019t imagine why you thought the solution was to invite her ex when you could TALK TO HER. \n\nYTA.", "I was all ready to say YTA, but frankly you found out she'd been lying to you for weeks. At which point, I would have invited him SPECIFICALLY to force it to a head, and make her come clean. \n\nLiars are garbage, don't let your daughter continue imo...  NTA", "If not only for the fact you don't know what they did. Plenty of \"nice boys\" hit their girlfriends, or rape their girlfriends or cheat on their girlfriends. Consider that for a second op. You don't know what you brought to your daughters party through your \"momma knows best\" attitude.", "I agree except for the \u201clet me ask my daughter if she wants you to come\u201d part. It\u2019s a surprise party. You\u2019re right though in the rest of it.", "The entire decision making is strange daughter lies and makes mom think she is still dating the boy. But the boy tells her they are not and still wants to come or the party. \n\n\nI mean it was one thing if he would have never said anything, but he did. That should have been the end of it. And at that point have a conversation with the daughter who was lying to OP.", "That's my thinking. Even if Matt were 100% innocent in the breakup and the daughter is in trouble, a birthday party is not the time or place to handle the issue.", "It was a surprise party, how was she supposed to do that?", "Months? I thought it was two weeks hold on let me go double check", "So. A lot of assumption here about the mom and her motives.   Just gonna say, this is a pretty nothing situation. This was not a trap or confrontation.   OP didnt even invite the ex, he asked to come and talk,  they did and she left.  Mom's like closure I guess.  \n\nOP didn't confront the daughter for lying(worrying where she is going and who she's going with are the things parents are allowed to be snoops about in the same way we expect kids to be sneaky about it.), that conversation doesn't seemed to have happened yet.\n\nAll that really happened was a 17 year old girl discovered her mother's \"involvement\" in an uncomfortable situation, and said mean things to her.  This tends to happen a lot.  \n\nNAH, but probably make sure your daughter isn't dating/becoming a junkie.", "I agree with the rest of this, but the \"clearly hiding\" part? Have you considered this might be a pattern of behavior on the mom's part where she interferes with the daughters private life? The mom clearly approves of Matt, and the daughter probably knows that. So when she broke up with Matt, it's possible she didn't want to tell the mom in case the mom started trying to get them back together against the daughters wishes (like what has happened here where the mother effectively forced a confrontation). It's not like drugs were found in the daughters room or anything, and strange behavior can be reasonably attributed to going through a major breakup & then hiding it. Drugs may be on a list of possibilities but the mother shouldn't be automatically assuming the worst of her child and instead doing her best to communicate better with the daughter without making accusations against her.", "This. This is exactly what I was thinking. So many bad decisions in this whole party mess.", "Op is the asshole for expecting the ex boyfriend to deal with her behavior. Op needs to be a parent.", "She needs to NEVER talk to Matt. That\u2019s inserting herself further into their situation than she should be. If she can\u2019t talk to her own kid then that\u2019s her real problem.", "She should NOT talk to matt at all, she should talk to her daughter.", "Exactly. OP\u2019s daughter used Matt in her lies. He has more than enough reason to confront. If something happened to the daughter Matt would be the first person the cops would look for.", "Oh yeah, missed that part. Then yeah it should have just ended there.", "I did not see the surprise party part. My judgement still stands. She should have known better than to invite an ex to a party.", "Then she just should not have invited the boy after she knew they were broken up.  Not for nothing, but did she really think the surprise party was a good time for daughter and her ex to speak?\nOp YTA", "It is indeed two weeks ago that they broke up. The only place it says a few months is where she is said to be friends with people that use drugs. The only proven lie is from two weeks ago, you are jumping to conclusions along with the mom based on circumstantial evidence, it's not like drugs were found in the daughters room or anything, nothing has been confirmed. Attitudes like this toward her that automatically assume the worst of her are probably why she feels the need to lie and hide in the first place.", "Very valid points I didn't think of. Thank you.", "If she tells her mother she\u2019s with him and is not with him for 2 weeks that\u2019s clearly lying regardless of whether there gets in her business or not.", "Why was she lying about Matt while using Matt as an excuse when leaving the house? She noticed about the guy she is hanging out with now being into drugs. This is something she needs to check. She is a parent not a friend, she needs to check out if her daughter is okay", "That's terrible advice", "It happens to the best of us.", "I understand what you\u2019re saying, but also realize that OP had no clue about the breakup until the ex told her about it. She could have fairly responded to her daughter\u2019s objection to her inviting the ex with \u201cI don\u2019t understand how he could be your ex\u2026 you told me you were going out with him LAST NIGHT!\u201d", "I didn't say it wasn't lying, I was objecting to the phrasing that made it sound like she had secrets that needed to be exposed for her own good. Sometimes people have decent motivations to lie even if the person being lied to doesn't like it. Sometimes the person being lied to isn't being told the truth because they have responded in ways in the past that show telling that person the truth is not the best course of action.", "Then she can simply ask the daughter if she is alright and needs help, not go interrogating people the daughter knows to pry into her business. Have you considered all the drug related stuff is circumstantial evidence at this point? It's not as if she found actual drugs in her room. The mother clearly approves of Matt, and the daughter probably knows that. The daughter may have just been lying about being together with Matt still since she doesn't want her mother interrogating her on why they broke up or trying to convince her to get back with Matt when she doesn't want to. If this mother regularly does stuff that invades her privacy like inviting the ex to her birthday party for the sake of pushing a confrontation, then I would be lying to this mother too if I was the daughter.  Mother-YTA.", "Oh please no.\nDon't remember how you were as a teen? \nThe more a parent tries to get involved, the more a teen will push the parent away.\nThe parent does not know \"what's best for her\" in her beliefs. \nIf this girl lied about her whereabouts it is probably because the parent's wouldn't allow it if they knew, or at least she thinks so. Hence the lying.\nThe only way to get the full and honest story from a teen is by not judging them and by not trying to control their lives anymore.", "Her checking doesn\u2019t mean going to Matt. It means talking to her kid and paying more attention to her.\n\nMatt is going to have is opinion. Supposed Matt was abusive? Then she\u2019s going to the abuser for answers.", "Exactly, \"if she can't talk to her own kid, then that's her real problem\" How stupid was that? Gosh some people here are treating parents like they are friends. No, parents need to be parents and do whatever they can to make sure the children are okay. Like this case, OP realized a sudden change in her daughter. It will be too late if she acts much later. She is turning 18 in a year", "And at point when the ex asked if he could still come, the mother should have said no. And what you are proposing is her lying to her daughter. The daughter shouldn\u2019t have lied but the OP should have been able to see that the daughter would be upset with her ex being there.", "Yeah, that is actually a better answer. But since she doesn't want her mother interrogating her, I guess the next step is let her go", "The girl also lied about still being in relationship with Matt and is hanging out with a guy known for being connected with drugs. Sounds like letting her do her thing is a smart idea.", "Yup she definitely needs to talk to her daughter and pray she does not lie", "I\u2019m not suggesting that she be friends with her kid. I\u2019m saying that she\u2019s not going to learn about what\u2019s going on with her child by not talking to her and paying attention to her movements.\n\nShe\u2019s been missing things because she made assumptions about where her kid was and who she was hanging out with. If she needs to go to Matt for answers then she\u2019s a crap mother.\n\nSimple parents go begging for short cut answers rather than actually talking to their children. \u201cOh, I\u2019m going to talk to everybody else in the world but my own kid!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one thing if she tried talking to her kid on multiple occasions and Matt is a last resort. But that\u2019s not what you suggested.", "Exactly!", "I\u2019m not advocating any lie at all. Based upon what the daughter told her mother, the statement is 100% accurate. \n\nOr, are you saying that the mother should automatically take the word of another person over her daughter? The last she heard from her daughter, this man was her boyfriend. \n\nSeriously\u2026 think through what you\u2019re saying here.", "It\u2019s not just talking to her kid, but also paying attention to her movements. \u201cOh, you are hanging out with do n so, we\u2019ll bring them in the house so I can say hi.\u201d You know, a thing called active parenting? Ha!", "She didn\u2019t make assumptions. Her daughter actively lied to her. While I advocate giving your children privacy it comes with caveat if you think they may be in danger. I consider the chances of becoming a drug addict a huge danger. \nShe should talk with her daughter definitely but if it still seems like lies are afoot I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to find out what\u2019s going on. By the time her friends say something she would be damn near a full fledged drug addict because otherwise they don\u2019t tell on each other. They\u2019ll just whisper amongst each other.", "But we all know that the daughter was lying and the boyfriend disclosed that they were broken up. Therefore it would be a lie if the OP said that she didn\u2019t know that they were broken up.", "What are the chances that the ex would lie about that? Especially if he was wanting to talk to her still, it would be so much easier to not say anything about the break up and accept the invitation. The daughter has motivation to lie, the ex doesn't. It's a pretty reasonable assumption that the ex was being honest, and turns out he was.", "I am actually less concerned with the privacy issue, but otherwise I agree with you. I think she looks and talks to her daughter first and foremost. \n\nFrankly, I\u2019d use that \u201cyou lied to me\u201d all the way to as much clarity and honesty as possible. *We need to talk and I need more transparency from you **because you lied to me.** Why did you lie to me and what did you lie about? If you are satisfied with your behavior then you shouldn\u2019t have a problem being honest. The last thing I want is to not trust you because you are being dishonest and engaging in harmful, dangerous behavior. If you can\u2019t be honest with me then I\u2019m going to assume the worst and we, as your family, are going to do everything to love and protect you.*"]}
