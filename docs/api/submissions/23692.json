But before that he would be fine, because we worked hard on it and I would leave for his sake and mine and the sake of the hosts. When he got worse it was very very very rarely in public and managed just fine now. I so often see stiff like this and think *if my kid can do it why not some of the other kids?\"", "At 10 she was too old to be a flower girl, anyway. Ridiculous.   \nOP, NTA.

In my experience, kids don't really enjoy weddings and it's extra stress on the parents.", "Then, as a parent, you don\u2019t put them in situations where you set them up to fail or allow them to ruin events. I have a special needs kid that I missed many events for due to behavioral issues. However, they were aware that they would be allowed once they had control and could learn to excuse themselves when they recognize they were getting overwhelmed and not unpredictable. I left grocery carts of food behind in grocery stores on occasion. I would never have taken them to a wedding and didn\u2019t until they understood the expectations, had control of their actions, and would accept an exit plan if needed. I still won\u2019t take them on a plane or cruise because it is does not afford an exit strategy. Our next step will be train travel.", "Straight up this is what would\u2019ve happened to me.

LMAO\n\nSooo...I was 8 (??) and my little brother and sister were 4 and 5. Now, this was back in 1980/81. It was my Aunt's wedding (my Mom's sister) and we are a HUGE Italian/Cajun family. Needless to say, there were A LOT of adults, and few kids (my Mom was the oldest and this was the second get married.) Mom was the oldest of 7. None of her siblings had had kids except her. So, we were basically the only kids there (I know we were the youngest kids there). We were also in the wedding. So were my parents. We also were NOT being watched. I remember dancing with my Dad and I remember running around and just having fun. Then there was this cool-looking fountain that I thought was punch and I went over there to get some. Now, let me add, my Dad was an alcoholic. (I use the past tense because he passed away from alcoholism in 2015). He gave me a glass and told me not to tell my Mom.  It was bubbly and it was good. It was champagne. This was NOT my first experience with alcohol. Being the oldest I went and told the other three siblings, he gave each of them a glass too, and told them not to tell also. Then he went to hang out with the rest of the groomsmen. We hit that damn fountain like flies to honey. My brother was in a rented tux and Grease was popular. So much so that my brother was sliding across the dance floor on his knees and had burned holes in them! LOL! Everyone thought he was hilarious. Then my brother and sister got sick. Like....they were puking everywhere. My Grandmother was the first to see my brother throw up. She thought it was the cake. She grabbed him and me and I had to help him in the bathroom. That's when she realized he was drunk. Ohhhhh boy was she pissed. I had to go get my Mom. LMAO. Then Mom went and got my two other sisters and that's when my Mom and Grandmother realized we were ALL drunk. That champagne fountain came down REAL quickly. Then my little sister got sick. We laugh about it now, and when my Aunt got the VHS tape back of her wedding we watched the reception, she had NO idea about any of this. Mom was pissed all over again...and boy did my Dad get his ass chewed cause there on the videotape the videographer captured my Dad giving us the glasses of champagne and him telling us NOT to tell our Mom and then him leaving. Have y'all ever seen TWO half-Italian - Half Cajun women pissed? I have, holy shit!!!! And that was the last time alcohol flowed freely at ANY of our weddings. LMAO", "I saw a similar group start gathering at a wedding just recently, but the hovering kids waited reasonably patiently until it was cut and presented - the little goobers just wanted to eat cake!\n\nNone of them would have deliberately ruined it, although stealing some icing does sound like a real possibility.", "My late Mother-in-law remarried when my husband was 3 (his bio Dad had passed away) and there is a picture of him with one finger in the icing of the cake.  Grown-ups put him up to it because they thought it would be a cute picture.\n\nNo one would have allowed any child to seriously damage the cake.  Linda needs to take some parenting classes because she is failing miserably.", "But that would suggest a very targeted tantrum. As soon as the kid started acting up, they should have been taken aside or out, not let run free.", "She probably has a developmental disability and isn\u2019t being properly treated for it.", "Oh yeah, I can see this. She violated the midwestern rules where we\u2019re all surface level polite and pretend to like each other while thinking scathing things quietly to ourselves.", "Sometimes it's hard to recognize when family is \"toxic\" because that's the only family you know. I grew up in an emotionally abusive environment, but I didn't realize that until I was in college and away from my family. I had to come to terms with the idea that my childhood was NOT normal and that mentally healthy people didn't behave the way my family did. A lot of therapy and self reflection during those years, lol.\n\nEdit: Grammer.", "And demands her child gets presents at her cousin\u2019s/friend\u2019s birthdays, no doubt!", "Same here.", "I mean the stranger yelling at a 7 year old for accidentally spilling water is actually the bad guy here tho.", "I would kill to see this tape lmao", "There is no such thing as too old to be a flower girl, age is a state of mind.

ESH definitely feels different than a JAM.", "Please tell me that someone was able to run out to a bakery or even a grocery store and get a quick replacement cake or cakes or any cake with white icing plus a bunch of cupcakes. I'd have strangled that kid (not really, but you get the idea).

Have you had recent interactions with her that lead you to believe she would still throw a fit? \n\nMy daughter was a nightmare in certain situations for years (despite our best efforts), but two years is a long time for a small child. She is now a lot calmer than she was two years ago, and I would expect that Cerrie might be, too.", "YTA. Holding a grudge against a ten year old is nearly as juvenile as that kid's behavior at past weddings. If you don't want her there, that's your right, but the courteous way to exclude the child is to also not invite the parents.\n\nTo invite the parents and NOT the child, but to invite other children , you were inviting this confrontation. It's your wedding, so you can do what you see fit, but the way you went about it is passive aggressive and kind of shitty. That's why you've gotten so much shittiness in return.", "YTA. I know I am in the minority but can you imagine what it would be like to be the only kid not invited? I would be a good uncle and have a talk with the kid and let her know how important the day is. Why not give her a small role?  She is older now and everyone deserves a chance. She is too close of a relative to do single her out. She is just a kid.  \n\nI am assuming she is not seriously mentally ill (where a wedding might be \u201ctoo much\u201d), just spoiiled.", "Yes. And really who are these people complaining anyway? Mostly the cousin\u2019s friends, who wouldn\u2019t be invited anyway. A few extended family members. \u201cCousin\u201d is extended family; their opinions on the wedding are irrelevant.

Sure you are fine not inviting the girl. However the a h part comes from inviting the parents.  Just don\u2019t invite any of them.  Y", "Sounds perfect to me. Dad was embarrassed by his kid\u2019s actions. Karen saw nothing wrong with it, refuses to apologize, and wants to keep on ruining everyone\u2019s celebratory time with her brat kid.

Most ten year long of girls would be mortified and embarrassed to be a flower girl, which is for like three to seven year olds.", "It is generally accepted as a dick move to not invite a specific person from a group to literally anything. Reddit tends to lean towards not liking kids and also lean towards being more provocative when dealing with shot like this so it makes sense that this comment section is all behind him. To me its justified to an extent but it is also a hugely asshole move. Let's look at it from that family's perspective. Yeah the kids an ass but you usually don't see as much of the problems of your own family. They get an invitation that specifically leaves out their child. That's an asshole move. See it from the families point of view. Literally everyone is invited from the family but one specific person. That is absolutely a dick move. It being justified is because of previous behaviour from the child. It still doesn't take out the asshole from the move if you get what I am saying. Sometimes you have to be an asshole to get through life bit you are still being an asshole by singling a singular person out behaviour or no. I have gone to quite a few weddings where the cousin everyone hated was there because general manners would tell you not to single out a single person.", "Looks like it!", "Oh, in that case.

A person with narcissistic traits, for example, will pass their behaviors to their children as well as causing the children to develop defensive mechanisms to cope with a life where you're constantly gaslit and questioning reality. Passive aggression is a terrible thing, too.\n\nA very very common behavior among families with maladaptive behaviors is to punish others instead of dealing with their own feelings. Many patterns of this type of emotionally stunted shorthand type of behavior end up in the person being outraged and rallying other people to back them up. They require the validation. For them, having people side with them is winning. \"See, they agree with me, so you're obviously wrong.\"\n\nThey're awful people and not worth knowing. Sadly, too many people cater to them because \"family\" and \"that's just how he/she is.\" If people would outcast the bad ones instead of pitying them and enabling their maladaptive behaviors, families would be happier.", "You can be right, and still be an asshole. They aren\u2019t mutually exclusive", "I strongly disagree. If the kid deserved to not be invited, it's not an asshole move. It's only an asshole move if the kid had done nothing wrong.

I can't honestly say that they weren't an AH, but there was good reason for it.  That's obviously different from N T A because they aren't blameless, but it's also different from Y T A because their admittedly bad behavior is, well, *justified*.

She said (at 7 years old), \"Mom is gonna get mad.\" She is also the one who doesn't drink and was always the tattle tell growing up. It's funny how even at that age, everything played out for how we would be as adults. \n\nIt's also a funny side note, those two younger siblings are also alcoholics too. I will admit I drank A LOT when I was in my 20's and in college, but when I had my kids I stopped/slowed down and then 5 years ago I had weight loss surgery and now it's very rare to see my rink at all.
