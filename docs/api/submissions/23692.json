It\u00b4s your wedding and u two are being too polite to invite her despite of her awful personality, but with kids is another story.

How old was she at the time of Lily's wedding?\n\nTwo years can make a huge difference in maturity and the capacity to navigate social situations for children.  Even for spoiled children.  \n\nUnless there are ongoing examples of the same behavior continuing to occur, holding a tantrum they had two years ago against a child is AH.  A seven year old can deal with things a five year old can't. \n\nPlus, two years ago was 2021.  You might remember a somewhat socially disruptive global event going on at that time?  Cerrie was not only two years younger than she is now, she'd also probably lost a year of socialization experience to quarantine.  Which she's probably had a chance to make up for, to some extent, by now. \n\nThe lockdowns were absolutely necessary, and saved many lives, but they were also disruptive, especially for children. Cerrie's now had a year or more to make up some of the things she didn't have a chance to learn, then. \n\nIf the only reason you're excluding Cerrie is one incident two years ago, that would be AH.\n\nIf Cerrie has ongoing problems, excluding her might make sense, and not be AH.  But it sounds as if her parents are as much or more to blame for any inappropriate behavior than she is, so why are you inviting her parents?", "Info: Did Carrie show any remorse at all or has changed her attitude since? 10 is indeed old to throw a tantrum but it is still a child and it has been 2 years. A lot can change in that time for a kid.", "It was two years ago? Maybe she's better behave now?", "YTA, deliberately excluding one child is in fact very rude.
