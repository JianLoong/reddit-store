If you want to do the things like dancing and the museum trip just do it yourself.", "NTA, wait until she has the kid.  Then it will be child friendly places only.  Start to look into second friend groups.  You can always do things with more than one group.", "Group dynamics change as we get older. You\u2019re allowed to mourn that. \n\nBut don\u2019t exclude your friend because she\u2019s pregnant. You\u2019re coming across as extremely self-centered. I bet if you were pregnant or injured, you would want your friends to make accommodations for you.\n\nI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re being so passive here? You let plans fall apart and then get big mad. You have agency. You can talk to her and to your other friends about how best to coordinate plans.\n\nIf there\u2019s something you really want to do that she can\u2019t, you\u2019re allowed to do it.

You can still be friends but hanging out all the time is probably going to change.  If she is tired and woozy from being pregnant, just wait until that baby comes.  Talk about no sleep for months, and then it will be catering to her always bringing baby/toddler along, or changing dates because of babysitters....  Not saying she's in the wrong... I'm just pointing out that this is only the beginning.  Figuring out now how you want your friendship to move forward will be key.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You\u2019re phrasing jt like she\u2019s ill when she\u2019s not, she\u2019s just pregnant, and obviously likes hanging out with your group of friends.", "YTA. Your attitude is really icky. You basically want to ditch your friend, saying she\u2019s \u2018entering another period of life\u2019.\n\nNews flash, you are *all* entering another period of life where someone people are going to start having kids. That means if you care more about your friends than going dancing, you\u2019ll accommodate them. Your friends sound like much better friends than you.", "YTA - I would wonder how much you actually care about your friendships with this attitude tbh. Clearly the rest of the group is putting more value on spending time together than the activity, so if you value the activity more, go on your own.", "I have a friend like that, and she's not pregnant.  She always thinks she can set the agenda.\n\nYou and your friends have the right to decide what you want to do.  If she's not up to it, tell her that the rest of you want to go, and you'll see her next time.  You've invited her, but if she can't make it, that's up to her.", "Eta- she doesn\u2019t realizing that she\u2019s manipulating every hang out to be in her best interest. She doesn\u2019t realize that maybe some people were really looking forward to the museum and manipulating every hang out is just selfish. \n\nYou should say something to the rest of your friends about it and see if they can try to maybe accommodate her less. And all of you (including the pregnant friend) can sit down and talk about it like adults. \n\n\u201cBecause of your pregnancy, we\u2019ve been changing all our plans to accommodate you. And it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t wanna hang out with you, I do! But I also still wanna do things like go to the museum or go dancing. Maybe we can do some things like that, without you, every other hang out or something. And the next hang out we can stay in and get pizza or go to the bar.\u201d\n\nIdk something like that. I understand where you\u2019re coming from and where she is coming from. But as adults, I think that you guys should be able to find a middle ground. At least I hope.", "Soft YTA, yes she wants to be included and soon shes not going to have the time to go to those things and places. \n\nYes it\u2019s frustrating to look forward to things and not be able to do them in favor of something more mundane, so I suggest maybe going by yourself or asking your friends seperately. Like \u201cHey I really want to see this Exhibit, I understand \u201cY\u201d cant go but I\u2019m going to take loads of photos and we can catch up at the cafe after\u201d that way you do plan A & you can still accommodate her need to be included", "YTA\n\nIf it's something you can do some other day why not accommodate the friend and make plans to do the original plan, also with her, in another day?\n\nIf it's something she can't do I'd say there's no harm in still going as long as it's not all the time.", "NTA OP should not rearrange her lude for her friend!", "This here. Pregnant people engage in all sorts of  activities that non-pregnant people do, if they are safe to do so.", "She can of course and she doesn\u2019t directly ask us to change plans, but points out that she barely got any sleep so doesn\u2019t have much energy etc, then my friends suggest we do something else, usually boring so she can hang with us.", "info: how is going to a bar accommodating a pregnant woman?", "Yeah I guess that makes sense. I was used to doing this kinda of things with this group of friends, so it\u2019s a weird change for me. I\u2019ll invite other friends for this kind of stuff.", "That\u2019s what I think it will happen. I think this group will become just the kind of friends you meet a couple times a year to catch up on things, not like going out and traveling together like we used to do", "Honestly I wonder what will happen with the group once the baby is born. Hopefully we could back to how it was but I\u2019m not confident on that", "Yeah I totally get that and that\u2019s okay. The issue for me is that the group dynamics totally changed and we stopped doing the things we used to do often. There\u2019s still times that she can\u2019t go out with us for another reason and we are able to do something fun.. that doesn\u2019t seem to bother anyone else so I might just have to accept and either go do what I enjoy by myself or with other friends", "Fair enough", "I get your point, and I don\u2019t want to ditch her but at the same time I want to do the fun stuff we used to do before like. I might have to accept that this group dynamic has changed and start going out with other friends as well for the fun stuff", "Honestly I value both so as others comments pointed out I might have to go by myself or with other people to do the activities I want to do and that\u2019s fine. it\u2019s just weird how the group dynamic changed so quickly", "Thanks for your words I think so too. I want to have that kind of conversation but it seems I\u2019m the only one bothered so I wonder if I am the problem not her? Idk how to bring it up but I\u2019ll try", "Yeah that\u2019s a good idea thank you", "It\u2019s kinda all the time, we meet as a group once every weekend more or less and she usually tags along so we have to change the plans and there\u2019s no other date everyone is available", "Ask her. \n\nHey pregnant friend, how are you doing and how is the baby? How are your symptoms? \nWe are planning to go cheese tasting this friday afternoon. Do you want to come with us? It is okay if you do not feel good last moment and want to sit this one out. We will try to sneak a doggy bag for you to try. \n\nJust let it open and ask her. \n\nHer complaining can also be venting. Be open and direct with her.", "Sounds like a lot of indirect communication. Next time, try pushing a little bit more. \n\n\"I was really looking forward to the museum. Pregnant friend, do you think you can manage the museum despite your exhaustion?\" She might have said yes. If it's no, then it's also totally cool to say \"Great, let's do coffee instead. But after we're done, I'll still head over to the museum. Anyone who wants to join can come.\"", "Then talk to them, not her. They're trying to be considerate--but it doesn't sound like she ever asked you all to change plans.\n\n\"Actually I'd really like to see the museum today, maybe we could hit a cafe next time?\"\n\nNAH", "So your friends are being supportive of her during a major life transition but it sounds like you are only fussed with her about it when she isn\u2019t even the one suggesting the changes? Sounds like you are the only one feeling inconvenienced so why don\u2019t you just be the one to stay home? \n\nYou should be grateful you have friends that adjust to each other\u2019s needs in this way. You never know what will happen in life and it could just as easily be you with an illness, injury, or other major life change that means you need extra consideration for some time to not be isolated and ostracized from the group.\n\nYTA for blaming her but ultimately NAH life changes are hard", "Right? She can't dance but she's going out for drinks? How does that make any sense?", "Yeah that\u2019s a good idea just do those things with a different friend group", "Listen to what the others are saying, there may be more in the group that are just going along with it because no one has the courage to stand up to her.  Next time have backup plans.  Have a drink at the bar then excuse yourself as you were invited to go dancing.", "Nope she will want to do thing that she can have the baby with her.  Just wondering is baby daddy part of the group?", "So was the \u201cgroup dynamic\u201d before to exclude people from hangouts if they couldn\u2019t do the activity due to continuous physical limitations? Or was it more your perception of the group being \u201cwe get together and do certain activities\u201d, but in reality the rest of the group mostly cared about spending time together?\n\nIf she wasn\u2019t pregnant but broke her foot/was in a boot for months and the group similarly accommodated, would you still have the same attitude?", "There might be others like you, but no one has been brave enough to stand up to her on this.", "But if she is not feeling well on the day you were supposed to go to the museum (for instance) why not go when she's feeling better?", "Yeah sounds like a good idea thank you", "Fair enough.. it does sound like I\u2019m the bothered one, and as others have said I can still go out my self or with a different group of friends for the things I want to do. I guess I just miss the things we used to do together.", "Not usually no we mostly see him on events like birthdays", "What I mean by group dynamic is that we are in our late 20s so we used to go out more, if not dancing we could be at a bar late hours getting drunk and having fun. What we do now is go out for coffee/dinner and maybe a drink but not much more than that", "She still joins even when she\u2019s not feeling well which is almost all of the time due to the pregnancy. In the end we end up changing our usual plans for something more chill (and boring at times) so we can all hang. Instead of some drinks in the evening, we might go for a coffee in the afternoon and things like that.\n\nIt\u2019s not that she really wants to go to the museum and I don\u2019t want to postpone to go with her, it\u2019s more like all our plans end up changing and we don\u2019t do the things we used to do", "Things change, people evolve, that's normal. I used to go to the movies with my friends. I think the last we went was like 6 or 7 years ago. Now we do other stuff. That's life.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that she's for sure not always feeling bad, so you could all go together do the fun stuff on a good day.\n\nI don't think you need to always be changing the plans.", "I hope that\u2019s the case soon but the past couple of months have been tough for her.. not enough sleep, back pain, nauseous, etc"]}
