You basically want to ditch your friend, saying she\u2019s \u2018entering another period of life\u2019.\n\nNews flash, you are *all* entering another period of life where someone people are going to start having kids. That means if you care more about your friends than going dancing, you\u2019ll accommodate them. Your friends sound like much better friends than you.", "YTA - I would wonder how much you actually care about your friendships with this attitude tbh. Clearly the rest of the group is putting more value on spending time together than the activity, so if you value the activity more, go on your own.", "I have a friend like that, and she's not pregnant.  She always thinks she can set the agenda.\n\nYou and your friends have the right to decide what you want to do.  If she's not up to it, tell her that the rest of you want to go, and you'll see her next time.

She doesn\u2019t realize that maybe some people were really looking forward to the museum and manipulating every hang out is just selfish. \n\nYou should say something to the rest of your friends about it and see if they can try to maybe accommodate her less. And all of you (including the pregnant friend) can sit down and talk about it like adults. \n\n\u201cBecause of your pregnancy, we\u2019ve been changing all our plans to accommodate you. And it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t wanna hang out with you, I do! But I also still wanna do things like go to the museum or go dancing. Maybe we can do some things like that, without you, every other hang out or something. And the next hang out we can stay in and get pizza or go to the bar.\u201d\n\nIdk something like that.

I was used to doing this kinda of things with this group of friends, so it\u2019s a weird change for me. I\u2019ll invite other friends for this kind of stuff.", "That\u2019s what I think it will happen. I think this group will become just the kind of friends you meet a couple times a year to catch up on things, not like going out and traveling together like we used to do", "Honestly I wonder what will happen with the group once the baby is born. Hopefully we could back to how it was but I\u2019m not confident on that", "Yeah I totally get that and that\u2019s okay. The issue for me is that the group dynamics totally changed and we stopped doing the things we used to do often. There\u2019s still times that she can\u2019t go out with us for another reason and we are able to do something fun.. that doesn\u2019t seem to bother anyone else so I might just have to accept and either go do what I enjoy by myself or with other friends", "Fair enough", "I get your point, and I don\u2019t want to ditch her but at the same time I want to do the fun stuff we used to do before like. I might have to accept that this group dynamic has changed and start going out with other friends as well for the fun stuff", "Honestly I value both so as others comments pointed out I might have to go by myself or with other people to do the activities I want to do and that\u2019s fine. it\u2019s just weird how the group dynamic changed so quickly", "Thanks for your words I think so too. I want to have that kind of conversation but it seems I\u2019m the only one bothered so I wonder if I am the problem not her?

How are your symptoms? \nWe are planning to go cheese tasting this friday afternoon. Do you want to come with us? It is okay if you do not feel good last moment and want to sit this one out. We will try to sneak a doggy bag for you to try. \n\nJust let it open and ask her. \n\nHer complaining can also be venting. Be open and direct with her.", "Sounds like a lot of indirect communication. Next time, try pushing a little bit more. \n\n\"I was really looking forward to the museum. Pregnant friend, do you think you can manage the museum despite your exhaustion?\" She might have said yes. If it's no, then it's also totally cool to say \"Great, let's do coffee instead.

They're trying to be considerate--but it doesn't sound like she ever asked you all to change plans.\n\n\"Actually I'd really like to see the museum today, maybe we could hit a cafe next time?\"\n\nNAH", "So your friends are being supportive of her during a major life transition but it sounds like you are only fussed with her about it when she isn\u2019t even the one suggesting the changes? Sounds like you are the only one feeling inconvenienced so why don\u2019t you just be the one to stay home? \n\nYou should be grateful you have friends that adjust to each other\u2019s needs in this way. You never know what will happen in life and it could just as easily be you with an illness, injury, or other major life change that means you need extra consideration for some time to not be isolated and ostracized from the group.\n\nYTA for blaming her but ultimately NAH life changes are hard", "Right? She can't dance but she's going out for drinks? How does that make any sense?", "Yeah that\u2019s a good idea just do those things with a different friend group", "Listen to what the others are saying, there may be more in the group that are just going along with it because no one has the courage to stand up to her.  Next time have backup plans.  Have a drink at the bar then excuse yourself as you were invited to go dancing.", "Nope she will want to do thing that she can have the baby with her.  Just wondering is baby daddy part of the group?", "So was the \u201cgroup dynamic\u201d before to exclude people from hangouts if they couldn\u2019t do the activity due to continuous physical limitations? Or was it more your perception of the group being \u201cwe get together and do certain activities\u201d, but in reality the rest of the group mostly cared about spending time together?\n\nIf she wasn\u2019t pregnant but broke her foot/was in a boot for months and the group similarly accommodated, would you still have the same attitude?", "There might be others like you, but no one has been brave enough to stand up to her on this.", "But if she is not feeling well on the day you were supposed to go to the museum (for instance) why not go when she's feeling better?", "Yeah sounds like a good idea thank you", "Fair enough.. it does sound like I\u2019m the bothered one, and as others have said I can still go out my self or with a different group of friends for the things I want to do. I guess I just miss the things we used to do together.", "Not usually no we mostly see him on events like birthdays", "What I mean by group dynamic is that we are in our late 20s so we used to go out more, if not dancing we could be at a bar late hours getting drunk and having fun. What we do now is go out for coffee/dinner and maybe a drink but not much more than that", "She still joins even when she\u2019s not feeling well which is almost all of the time due to the pregnancy. In the end we end up changing our usual plans for something more chill (and boring at times) so we can all hang. Instead of some drinks in the evening, we might go for a coffee in the afternoon and things like that.\n\nIt\u2019s not that she really wants to go to the museum and I don\u2019t want to postpone to go with her, it\u2019s more like all our plans end up changing and we don\u2019t do the things we used to do", "Things change, people evolve, that's normal. I used to go to the movies with my friends. I think the last we went was like 6 or 7 years ago. Now we do other stuff. That's life.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that she's for sure not always feeling bad, so you could all go together do the fun stuff on a good day.\n\nI don't think you need to always be changing the plans.", "I hope that\u2019s the case soon but the past couple of months have been tough for her.. not enough sleep, back pain, nauseous, etc", "NAH. Just read another similar post about restaurant choices. \n\nThe solution suggested by many people was to rotate who decided where they went, so everyone got a fair turn. \n\nSo your turn could be \u201cdefinitely museum\u201d and everyone else can choose if they want to cater to pregnant friend or not. \n\nBut maybe with a sub-rule of \u201cno changing at the last minute - if I\u2019m looking forward to dancing then let\u2019s still go dancing - make changes at least 48 hours in advance\u201d. \n\nIt would drive me mad having all my Fun Plans changed last minute.", "I mean no. But also if no one else cares. They are happy with changing plans. Then you may need to do those activities with other friends or something.", "NTA If every gathering is changed to something she wants to do just to accommodate her then honestly that's absurd just because her life circumstances have changed does not mean that everybody else has to accommodate that in every single instance. That's ridiculous. To mention that having a baby is a choice. it's okay for her to leave this life stage but to expect everyone else to is not fair or reasonable. It seems like everyone else is only willing to change plans if she protests in one way or the other about the current plans. I'm getting queen B vibes. I would branch out to another friend group.", "[deleted]", "INFO Is she actually asking you to make these accommodations for her condition or are you assuming she needs accommodations?", "NTA people need to learn that different stages of your life comes with different outings and being accompanied by people that share your experience. That\u2019s not to say that y\u2019all should stop hanging out with her fully but she needs to accept that you guys are on a different stage and she probably needs to find friends that are on her same wave and can give her guidance/advice/fully empathize with her.", "NTA \n\nBut tbh, pregnancy isn\u2019t very long, I wouldn\u2019t do or say anything that will ruin the friendship.

Then you'll have to go to a splash park instead of a rave....sigh \n\nThis is the beginning of the friend split between kids/no kids. It happens. If she really is a friend talk it out with her.

And you sit down while doing it?", "You may become happier in life when you let go of the idea that your happiness rests on things going \"back to how it was.\" Regardless of the topic, they almost never do.\n\nLearning how to enjoy new things is a valuable life skill. And as others have gently noted, these changes are probably not just because one of your friends is pregnant. *Most* people get tired of staying out all night clubbing as they get older, so you'll likely find it increasingly difficult to find peers who retain that interest as time goes on. Museum trips you'll probably get back though. In fact, probably *especially* with your friends with kids, once the kids are a few years old and their parents want to start exposing them to culture.", "I was the first of my friend group to get married and have kids.  My social life with those friends definitely changed.  It was far more nights in together.  But, I could see when they were really making an effort to spend time with me and those friendships stuck.  I missed my old social life and it can be a hard adjustment on her as well. \n\nIf there are things you love to do, go do them! You'll find the right people to do them with.

Life changes are hard. The pregnant friend will soon be the friend with a newborn and then the friend with a toddler and she will be also realising that her life changes mean that she needs friends in the same place.\n\nBut by accommodating her now it shows a genuine care for her and almost a way to mourn the life change -- which will affect the friendship circle in some way.", "at a restaurant, sure. at a bar? i\u2019m not saying pregnant people can\u2019t go to bars, but the idea that that would be the \u201cpregnancy-friendly\u201d option strikes me as absurd.", "At least at a bar you can sit, get food, and be part of the conversation.

Usually I go more for music festivals etc when I can or a just a place with good vibes and drinks. Agree on letting go about how it was though, it will be different but I can look for what I want in other places and other people I guess", "And keep in mind she may actually just want to stay home and chill but might feel like she has to keep up being social and fun. I was the first of my group to get pregnant and I felt like a shitty friend for not being energetic and becoming a homebody. So she might be relieved.", "Lots of people slow down and get sick of things like clubbing as they get older. Your friends could very well be using her as an excuse to not do those things because they're not up for it either.", "Hey that makes total sense. Grief is a normal part of change and it\u2019s okay to acknowledge that. I\u2019d guess your pregnant friend feels that way sometimes too. It really does sound like your friend group has a good thing going so hang in there. Change comes with good and bad.", "No idea why your comment is downvoted here. It is honest and fair.", "Yes? Why not. Especially if the bar is one with good food.

It sounds like maybe the friend group is entering a different stage of life and wants to do different things now and you're feeling left behind. What happens if other members of the friend group start families? Maybe they feel tired of drinking and partying every weekend.\n\nKeep doing what you like, but this isn't your pregnant friend's fault.
