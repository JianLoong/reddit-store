She always thinks she can set the agenda.\n\nYou and your friends have the right to decide what you want to do.

I think this group will become just the kind of friends you meet a couple times a year to catch up on things, not like going out and traveling together like we used to do", "Honestly I wonder what will happen with the group once the baby is born. Hopefully we could back to how it was but I\u2019m not confident on that", "Yeah I totally get that and that\u2019s okay. The issue for me is that the group dynamics totally changed and we stopped doing the things we used to do often. There\u2019s still times that she can\u2019t go out with us for another reason and we are able to do something fun.. that doesn\u2019t seem to bother anyone else so I might just have to accept and either go do what I enjoy by myself or with other friends", "Fair enough", "I get your point, and I don\u2019t want to ditch her but at the same time I want to do the fun stuff we used to do before like.

How are your symptoms? \nWe are planning to go cheese tasting this friday afternoon. Do you want to come with us? It is okay if you do not feel good last moment and want to sit this one out.

You never know what will happen in life and it could just as easily be you with an illness, injury, or other major life change that means you need extra consideration for some time to not be isolated and ostracized from the group.\n\nYTA for blaming her but ultimately NAH life changes are hard", "Right? She can't dance but she's going out for drinks? How does that make any sense?", "Yeah that\u2019s a good idea just do those things with a different friend group", "Listen to what the others are saying, there may be more in the group that are just going along with it because no one has the courage to stand up to her.  Next time have backup plans.  Have a drink at the bar then excuse yourself as you were invited to go dancing.", "Nope she will want to do thing that she can have the baby with her.  Just wondering is baby daddy part of the group?", "So was the \u201cgroup dynamic\u201d before to exclude people from hangouts if they couldn\u2019t do the activity due to continuous physical limitations? Or was it more your perception of the group being \u201cwe get together and do certain activities\u201d, but in reality the rest of the group mostly cared about spending time together?\n\nIf she wasn\u2019t pregnant but broke her foot/was in a boot for months and the group similarly accommodated, would you still have the same attitude?", "There might be others like you, but no one has been brave enough to stand up to her on this.", "But if she is not feeling well on the day you were supposed to go to the museum (for instance) why not go when she's feeling better?", "Yeah sounds like a good idea thank you", "Fair enough.. it does sound like I\u2019m the bothered one, and as others have said I can still go out my self or with a different group of friends for the things I want to do. I guess I just miss the things we used to do together.", "Not usually no we mostly see him on events like birthdays", "What I mean by group dynamic is that we are in our late 20s so we used to go out more, if not dancing we could be at a bar late hours getting drunk and having fun. What we do now is go out for coffee/dinner and maybe a drink but not much more than that", "She still joins even when she\u2019s not feeling well which is almost all of the time due to the pregnancy. In the end we end up changing our usual plans for something more chill (and boring at times) so we can all hang. Instead of some drinks in the evening, we might go for a coffee in the afternoon and things like that.\n\nIt\u2019s not that she really wants to go to the museum and I don\u2019t want to postpone to go with her, it\u2019s more like all our plans end up changing and we don\u2019t do the things we used to do", "Things change, people evolve, that's normal. I used to go to the movies with my friends. I think the last we went was like 6 or 7 years ago. Now we do other stuff. That's life.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that she's for sure not always feeling bad, so you could all go together do the fun stuff on a good day.\n\nI don't think you need to always be changing the plans.", "I hope that\u2019s the case soon but the past couple of months have been tough for her.. not enough sleep, back pain, nauseous, etc", "NAH. Just read another similar post about restaurant choices. \n\nThe solution suggested by many people was to rotate who decided where they went, so everyone got a fair turn. \n\nSo your turn could be \u201cdefinitely museum\u201d and everyone else can choose if they want to cater to pregnant friend or not. \n\nBut maybe with a sub-rule of \u201cno changing at the last minute - if I\u2019m looking forward to dancing then let\u2019s still go dancing - make changes at least 48 hours in advance\u201d. \n\nIt would drive me mad having all my Fun Plans changed last minute.", "I mean no. But also if no one else cares. They are happy with changing plans. Then you may need to do those activities with other friends or something.", "NTA If every gathering is changed to something she wants to do just to accommodate her then honestly that's absurd just because her life circumstances have changed does not mean that everybody else has to accommodate that in every single instance. That's ridiculous. To mention that having a baby is a choice. it's okay for her to leave this life stage but to expect everyone else to is not fair or reasonable. It seems like everyone else is only willing to change plans if she protests in one way or the other about the current plans. I'm getting queen B vibes.

And you sit down while doing it?", "You may become happier in life when you let go of the idea that your happiness rests on things going \"back to how it was.\" Regardless of the topic, they almost never do.\n\nLearning how to enjoy new things is a valuable life skill. And as others have gently noted, these changes are probably not just because one of your friends is pregnant. *Most* people get tired of staying out all night clubbing as they get older, so you'll likely find it increasingly difficult to find peers who retain that interest as time goes on. Museum trips you'll probably get back though. In fact, probably *especially* with your friends with kids, once the kids are a few years old and their parents want to start exposing them to culture.", "I was the first of my friend group to get married and have kids.  My social life with those friends definitely changed.  It was far more nights in together.  But, I could see when they were really making an effort to spend time with me and those friendships stuck.  I missed my old social life and it can be a hard adjustment on her as well. \n\nIf there are things you love to do, go do them! You'll find the right people to do them with.

Life changes are hard. The pregnant friend will soon be the friend with a newborn and then the friend with a toddler and she will be also realising that her life changes mean that she needs friends in the same place.\n\nBut by accommodating her now it shows a genuine care for her and almost a way to mourn the life change -- which will affect the friendship circle in some way.", "at a restaurant, sure. at a bar? i\u2019m not saying pregnant people can\u2019t go to bars, but the idea that that would be the \u201cpregnancy-friendly\u201d option strikes me as absurd.", "At least at a bar you can sit, get food, and be part of the conversation.

Usually I go more for music festivals etc when I can or a just a place with good vibes and drinks.

I was the first of my group to get pregnant and I felt like a shitty friend for not being energetic and becoming a homebody. So she might be relieved.", "Lots of people slow down and get sick of things like clubbing as they get older. Your friends could very well be using her as an excuse to not do those things because they're not up for it either.", "Hey that makes total sense. Grief is a normal part of change and it\u2019s okay to acknowledge that. I\u2019d guess your pregnant friend feels that way sometimes too. It really does sound like your friend group has a good thing going so hang in there. Change comes with good and bad.", "No idea why your comment is downvoted here. It is honest and fair.", "Yes? Why not. Especially if the bar is one with good food. More friendly than clubbing.", "She had a mocktail and we chatted, it wasn\u2019t a bad day but by midnight everyone was home", "That's true, I suppose I'm biased since I don't drink", "I mean, that's just how friendships change as you get older. It sounds like maybe the friend group is entering a different stage of life and wants to do different things now and you're feeling left behind. What happens if other members of the friend group start families? Maybe they feel tired of drinking and partying every weekend.\n\nKeep doing what you like, but this isn't your pregnant friend's fault. She's just different now", "Good point I think that might be the case", "more friendly than clubbing. i suppose that is a way of looking at it. then again, at least at a club there\u2019s dancing. anywhere a pregnant person has to sit and watch their friends and strangers get drunk is not pregnancy friendly, in my view. take a pregnant person to a bar if you like, it\u2019s their choice to go or not. but you must realize; you\u2019re not accommodating them. they\u2019re accommodating you.\n\nedit: spelling", "Honestly, that just sounds more like being in your mid-twenties to me.

Such is life.", "YTA- she\u2019s your friend", "NAH, because life changes are natural, and dynamics change without it being anyone's fault. Your pregnant friend didn't *do* anything to hurt you, and it also sounds like you haven't done anything to hurt your friend, despite your disappointment at plans changing.\n\nIt sounds like *you* are the one bothered by these accommodations for your friend, not the rest of your friends. I think it's not just your friend that might be grieving entering a new phase in life.", "I mean sometimes you should 100% change your plans (eg. you planned to go out drinking) but maybe ask her before you change plans since she might feel like first everyone is going to a museum then they are going for coffee because of her, but she can\u2019t complain because she\u2019s the one who asked to join in the first place.\n\nSorry if I made it too complicated lol", "I have a friend in my group like this too. Not pregnant or anything but always tried to change plans to suit herself. I\u2019ve learned if it\u2019s something i really care about, i just text the details: This is what I\u2019m doing, time and place. Anyone want to join? She\u2019s a smart girl and got the idea right away and she\u2019s fine with it. If yours is a good friend I hope you do some special things for her sometimes too. Having a baby, while very exciting, can also be very lonely when your best friends aren\u2019t at the same place in life.", "FYI -  she\u2019s pregnant, not sick with the flu.   If your friends automatically accommodate her just because she mentions she is tired, that\u2019s on all of you.  She\u2019s not broken.  So sorry your friend got herself pregnant and inconvenienced your social life.  Why don\u2019t you just stay home so you don\u2019t have to spend time with your friends.  YTA.", "Stop changing plans to accommodate her.  Either she can join or not.\n\nNTA", "I rock climbed (with doctors permission) until by bump got in the way.", "Yeah that\u2019s a good idea just do those things with a different friend group", "You need to realize the group dynamics always change.\n\nIt is very possible that you are the only one who really sees this change as a negative. For all you know, a lot of them actually enjoy the new dynamic, and that shift is likely to continue.", "The group dynamics won\u2019t be the same, I\u2019d appreciate it for what it is and then find what you\u2019re looking for with other people. If the other friends really don\u2019t have a problem with the changes she\u2019s bringing, she\u2019ll probably try to bring the baby along once she gives birth, and then the group will change even more to accommodate her. This kind of thing just happens. Either talk to the others or find more friends to go out with.", "It kinda sounds like everyone's growing up and hitting 30 and doesn't want to be going out every weekend.", "I think this is the best approach. You sound like a great friend SinkShrink!!", "You may become happier in life when you let go of the idea that your happiness rests on things going \"back to how it was.\" Regardless of the topic, they almost never do.", "Or make plans to meet her for coffee before/after the museum", "What all people and parents do when a kid arrives, \"well fuck, what do we do now?\"", "NAH. She is just a few months away from a total life change. Since your other friends don't care it would be generous to indulge her a little longer.", "It doesn't really sound like she is when no one else is complaining but OP.", "Indeed. It may be less that she wants to prove that she is \u2018young and still fun\u2019 and more that she is afraid to lose her connection with her friends while she enters this stage of life. The dialogue suggested by u/Physical_Stress_5683 seems a good route for this. She gets to join in for the things she can and the rest can go to the original plan after and perhaps this will clue in your other friends that a balance can be made.", "NAH. She is just a few months away from a total life change. Since your other friends don't care it would be generous to indulge her a little longer.", "Unless friend has the baby and then expects the friend group to always do something that accommodates the baby. I've seen this happen. So I would carefully start nipping this in the bud. Accommodate pregnant friend at times but don't adjust EVERY event for her."]}
