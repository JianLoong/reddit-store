It's a cute and fun tradition your family (minus the cousin) enjoy and something your nieces and nephews will remember for years to come. NTA", "Absolutely NTA.  Your cousin obviously has issues and should be the one offering an apology.  Unless you're leaving out some highly relevant context, I'm perplexed as to why anyone would think you owe any apology.\n\nYour cousin's financial situation shouldn't have any bearing on you financial choices.  And giving gifts is a financial choice.", "You're also not responsible for your cousin's feelings about her own lack of prosperity. She's old enough to know not to pull this kind of crap. No apology required. You're NTA.", "NTA The cousin doesn't seem to have realized that there is ALWAYS going to be someone with more money than you.  It's just the way life works.  If she resents this fact then she should keep it to herself.  Your method of gift giving isn't open to her envious policing. You don't owe a rude person an apology.  Exactly what does your mother think you should apologize for?  \"Oh I'm so sorry for reminding you of the bad financial decisions you and your husband have made.\"?", "NTA.  Apologize for being financially better off than your cousin?  Not sure how that\u2019s your fault, so I don\u2019t see what reason you\u2019d have to apologize.", "NTA - if complaining about kindness fixed anyone\u2019s money issues we\u2019d all be doing it. This is projection and despicable for being done at a child\u2019s birthday. Do not apologize, this cousin needs a financial expert and a therapist to deal with their misplaced frustration. \n\n\nI also give presents from my dog! She gives my boyfriend pawther\u2019s day gifts and my friends pawsome presents. lol", "NTA - one of the advantages of being child free is the lack of expenses kids create.\nYour love language is clearly gift giving so continue to do what brings you joy.", "NTA \u2026.WTF kinda twilight world is she living in that your mom thinks you should apologize \ud83e\udd23", "NTA, you don\u2019t owe that rude cousin crap", "This is wild to me. I always buy family more than one present - it feels weird to give less than three - and I don't even have dogs to explain the extras. The fact three of them come from your animals is super cute. Sorry that your cousin is having financial difficulties but that really has nothing to do with you (and your pets) giving your niece presents. NTA.", "I'm poor as hell. It sucks. But I NEVER, in a million years, would feel upset at a child getting a bunch of presents just because I couldn't afford them myself. That is absolutely ridiculous. I'd be ecstatic that a child could experience that, even if it wasn't my own. Would she have said the same thing had you given their children 4 gifts? Have you bought her children gifts like that before? My husband's aunt is filthy rich, she helps everyone out with houses and cars and whatever they ask for. But we don't want the control that comes with that so we don't ask for anything. But I'm no less happy for his siblings that are able to provide a home or safe car for their kids because of her. Why wouldn't I want somebody I care about to have nice things? This really says a lot about her character, imo.", "Ew\n\nAbsolutely NTA", "NTA. I have a close group of friends, 4 out of 5 of us have pets. Our pets exchange Christmas gifts every year.", "NTA\n\nDo not ever stop giving generously.  It is adorable your pets give gifts.  Your cousin really does need therapy.  Enjoy your sweet nibblings and your sweet doggies and kitty.", "NTA. Sounds like she's jealous of your lifestyle. You simply stated the obvious. Sounds like your mom folds like a wet paper towel when it comes to conflict, tell her to shut up about this, you're an adult and she has no control over you. You won't be pushed around by someone so selfish they'd have 4 kids when they can't afford them, and then insist everyone else cater to them.", "NTA.  Tell your mother that your cousin attacked you, not the other way around.  You did nothing wrong.  You weren't \"showing off\" and won't apologize for getting gifts for your niece.  \n\nYour cousin and his wife chose to have 4 kids and live on one income.  That's clearly a choice.  You are single with a good income - also a choice.", "I don\u2019t think your pets should buy your cousin any presents, going forward. Obviously she doesn\u2019t respect your pets, and so she does not need to enjoy their generosity. \n\nYou, OP, can also choose to \u201cflaunt your wealth\u201d, elsewhere. NTA", "NTA. Unless the child or the child's parents have an issue with the gifts you're fine. Gifts from animals are cute.", "NTA - first of all this is your niece you can give her as many presents as you please. But also even though the presents are from you fur babies it\u2019s also pretty clear they\u2019re from you, like a little kid giving a gift at the birthday party. I\u2019d only see an issue with this if you only did the four presents for your favourite family member and didn\u2019t do it for the others.", "This reads like a piece of childfree fiction. \n\nINFO: Did everybody clap?", "NTA from the looks of it this is the first time the topic even came up. Her insecurity is her responsibility, so are her feelings and how she handles them.\n\nIf you flaunt your wealth, as she says, by giving many gifts, then flaunt away imo. You sound like a kind person, don't let her jealousy steer you away from being like this.", "NTA. If your cousin is jealous of your \u201cwealth\u201d than that is a her problem. \nIt\u2019s pathetic that a grown woman caused a scene at a child\u2019s birthday party because of her petty jealousy and insecurity. \nYour mom needs to mind her business. Why should you apologize to an asshole who threw and adult tantrum? If anyone should apologize it\u2019s your cousin. She owes you one and brother and SIL. In fact  she owes everyone who witnessed her bullshit an apology. \nFour kids and one income? That\u2019s a her and her husband issue.\nYou handled her perfectly which is why she got even more pissed. \nFuck her. Glad you enjoyed your slice of cake.\nI also give gifts \u201csigned\u201d by my pup to family.", "I would be inclined to sarcastically apologize saying \n\n\"sorry for how I celebrated my niece's birthday without consulting you first. I definitely should have taken your feelings into account on her special day. Going forward I will remember for all special events, you should be my first priority.\"", "Apologise for what exactly? For working hard and having money in the bank? For being kind and loving your family? For having a nice personality? You have nothing to Apologise for. My goodness.", "Nta, your cousin's jealousy. You're so palatable. It's ridiculous. Keep doing what you do, and let her know. I'm sorry my dogs are doing better than you and your husband. If you can't afford four kids, don't have four kids. They only have that income because the cousin doesn't work.\n\nYou did the right thing and the cousin is an idiot. Don't apologize and don't stop giving the gifts you give.", "NTA, this is just a bit bizarre to me, is there some weird expectation that you should only get 1 present for people? It's a quirky lil thing to address as from your pets, would they still be upset if they were all labelled from you?", "NTA", "So just to confirm,  you gave a December baby who isn't yours more than one birthday gift?\n\nNTA at all! And as a parent of two of them, you're a Saint!", "Unless you are giving an Xbox, your dog gives a switch, the cat gives a motorized car and the other dog gives a full size doll house, I doubt you\u2019re flaunting your wealth. It\u2019s a cute tradition, especially for the kids, but if your cousin has such a disdain for your animals, I think it\u2019s time for them to stop gifting her anything ;)\n\nNTA and for her next birthday, might I suggest a gift certificate for the nearest therapist", "I mean, i think it's fucking weird, but NTA. You do you.", "Her jealousy and money problems are not yours to deal with.  She is owed no apology for having her breakdown at a freaking party. \n\nI think it is adorable your furbabies send gifts and that having 4 kids on one income is monumentally stupid. \n\nNTA", "ESH Gifts from your pets is actually extremely cringy. And no kid needs 4 presents from an aunt/uncle. That being said--she made something just a bit tacky into a *huge* screaming deal and it didn't have to be.", "Didn\u2019t even have to finish reading. NTA in the slightest. You have this little tradition and the funds to make it happen. Your cousin needs to learn to keep shit to themselves. You\u2019re not responsible for their financial situation and not doing anything wrong. I\u2019d have laughed at her too", "NTA - She should not be allowed to squash the joy surrounding your niece's birthday. She needs to learn to not vomit cruel opinions on others that are fueled by her life experiences. Repeating a hurtful rant is disrespecting why peopled gathered.  Best to you & cool tradition!", " NTA. I love this and I am jealous of your neice getting a present from the cat. Because cats :)", "But it doesn't matter. It's her money and she likes giving gifts to her family. Why should she deprive her niece of beautiful gifts if she can afford it ? So she doesn't offend a cousin ? Really ?\n\nEnough of always walking on freaking egg shells to make sure nobody is offended. \n\nThey are the one with money problems. Why should that affect how OP treats her family ?\n\nAnd I beg to differ that a cat giving an Ipad is really funny and cute.", "Oh don't worry! My cat is a hedge fund executive. She can afford it. \ud83d\ude0a", "Why does it matter? We all know the gifts are from OP, adding that the gifts are from the pets is a cute joke. OP giving gifts to her neice has nothing to do with the cousin. As long as the kids' parents are fine with the gifts, then it doesn't matter how much OP spends. Cousins financial issues and jealousy have nothing o do with OP and have no place being argued about at a child birthday.", "I think context should be focused on how the niece reacts to getting gifts from the other family members. If she's showing the same level of excitement with everyone and isn't expressing favoritism for the better gifters, then this is just cousin being jealous throwing a hissy fit. If the kid isn't being a spoiled brat, there is no reason to start a fight about this issue to the point of yelling in front of said child. That will be one of the more memorable parts of that's kid party for the next few days.", "She has two dogs, so they each give one.", "Yeah, and what's with all these people demanding apologies from one person to a third person? Cuz was throwing a temper tantrum. Your sister recognized what was going on and your mom just wanted to placate her?

I have people like the cousin in my family. I had one of my in laws tell me once that since we have a nice car and our kids go to private school that we needed to pay their delinquent light bill. When we said no you would not believe the tantrum a full grown adult had and complained to everyone in the family that we refused to help them it was ridiculous. \n\nThe same inlaw was upset they didnt get more from us for Christmas and literally said \u201cis this it? You cant be serious!\u201d Welp that was the LAST gift they every received from us.", "The cousin can also get a job to help out with their financial situation.

That part doesn't sound unbelievable. \n\nBut OP writing how the the \"just sit back and enjoy their delicious cake\" and how they are \"not responsible for cousin's bad choices\" (4 children! Gasp!)\n\nThat all reads wayyyyyy to smug.", "We have 3 kids and I'm a SAHM (trying to find a WFH job due to toddler and ND kiddo but not having much luck) and we manage but that's only because we get roughly a $1000/fn in government benefits which is around a third of hubby's cheque extra. We also have all the kids birthdays around Xmas which sucks but I have a plan that I start a year out (so money for this time next year started getting put away this yesterday).\n\nIt takes discipline and planning to do it (and I'm sure there are some families where that's not enough) but we manage, my kids don't go without and I certainly never complain that people are better off than us financially.

It\u2019s embarrassing that someone old enough to be married and have four kids is acting so childish, and your mom should see that.
