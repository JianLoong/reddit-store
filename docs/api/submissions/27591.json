She complained that it was unfair that i wouldn't cook for her even though I stayed home all day.

I think you mean 3500-4000.\n\nCopying my comment above.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCanadian former construction worker chiming in. I am 6'4\", 250 lbs at the time and not overweight at all. I would regularly eat 4k calories a day and would still lose weight. my BMR is around 2400 cal and my TDEE at the time was 4-5k cal.", "Why does everyone downvoting this comment? We all know this is true.", "I saw someone bring up the division of labour and how it seems he is taking the biggest burden. The sub went nuts when their own games were played against them", "LOL.   We pretty much subsist on pre-made microwave meals from costco (their Tikki Masala is excellent), so don't feel bad.   Throw something green on the plate to assuage the guilt a little.", "That what you took from that? It seems like he never agree to be \"his chore\". It seems he is stuck doing ALL the household chores Just because he Works less than his wife. He isn't a SAHD, actualy. He also contributes financially to the household. Wife needs to step up...", "That\u2019s called raising a child, not watching them. \n\nYou are the dad, so put some effort into your family. You\u2019re not an uncle, neighbor, or nanny; act like it.", "Did OP\u2019s wife use the word unhealthy or is that the word OP is using to categorize the food that she requested?", "And he specifically put unhealthy in quotes. So that could mean anything he deems as unhealthy but doesn\u2019t really mean it is, just that it\u2019s not on his diet. A little butter every now and then isn\u2019t unhealthy. Salt can be good for you in moderation, as sodium is an essential mineral. Dairy is healthy for women especially.", "It is mentally healthy to have unhealthy foods sometimes tho. Ask anyone who grew up in a house too focused on \"health\" and most of us have problems regulating unhealthy food intake because we were restricted as children instead of being taught moderation", "Where did OP say he did ALL the chores?", "Unhealthy might mean Mac and cheese or a sandwich in this context", "Unhealthy in scare quotes - it\u2019s obvious OP\u2019s family didn\u2019t ask to get more unhealthy food verbatim, he\u2019s just hiding what they asked for.\n\nI reckon the verdict would change if he explained what their \u2018unhealthy\u2019 ask was. Otherwise it\u2019s similar to missing missing reasons.", "I have a sibling who\u2019s done basically every fad diet that there is, and when they\u2019re in \u201chealthy eating\u201d mode, the food they tend to prepare is not delicious. It is the opposite of delicious. \n\nSo if the wife did actually say she wanted OP to prepare less healthy meals (we don\u2019t know that she actually used the word unhealthy, only that OP did when describing her request to us, but if she did say she wanted him to cook unhealthy food), it\u2019s possible that what she meant was \u201cfood that tastes like something.\u201d", "You\u2019re taking OP\u2019s word that \u201cunhealthy\u201d (in quotes) means actually unhealthy. OP used scare quotes around that, so he\u2019s leaving part of the situation out. We don\u2019t even know what he\u2019s cooking - he could be going hard on keto for all we know.\n\nThis can easily be settled by asking what OP\u2019s wife and kid are actually asking to eat.\n\nBut you\u2019ve said it yourself - OP wants gym culture diet. That is categorically not appropriate to share with people who aren\u2019t working out. Those diets are highly specific to your routine and body composition.", "I\u2019m specifically replying to the person who mentioned lean protein, rice/potatoes and veggies. Only veggie that will supply the healthy fats is avocado. It\u2019s worth flagging that the typical lean protein/rice/veggie gym bro meal typically underperforms on healthy fats.", "Agreed. Cooking rice is super easy and there are even rice makers, meaning essentially zero extra work.", "But if you are cooking \u201clow calorie\u201d food - wouldn\u2019t you simply cook the same meal, but more of it to meet the other people\u2019s caloric needs? Way too much specific info missing from OP", "Well, there actually are meals that are lower calorie by default. Hence OP, in comments, saying that he's making larger portions for wife and daughter. Meaning, the meal is low calorie and requires a larger portion in order to meet the appropriate calorie requirement. Otherwise OP would just be making meals and then portioning *less* for himself. I already pointed out that there's a difference between low calorie and healthy. You can have a low calorie, but very unhealthy diet (like eating very small amounts of garbage food) or you can have high calorie, healthy food. It seems if OP is in charge of meal planning/prep, it makes sense for the meals to be healthy and to meet the caloric needs of each person eating said meals. I personally do not enjoy eating very much and it's hard to get enough calories. I try to make sure the foods I eat have a high nutrient density so I don't have to eat as much or as frequently. The idea of having to eat way more because the food is low calorie would be annoying. It doesn't really need to be that difficult either. Just add some avocado or nuts or olive oil, if it's a salad, for example. And yeah, I agree if the wife's request is specifically for \"unhealthy\" food (which to me, relates more to the quality of food, as opposed to the calories), I think it's fine to say no, and if she wants fast food, she is welcome to get that instead.", "If you have fats, proteins, carbs and macros, you absolutely do need to also account for calories.\n\nHonestly, low calorie diets *do* tend to work because in order to eat enough food on a low calorie diet, you need to bulk out on veggies. End of the day, CICO is an effective tool, and yeah, you can balance everything else but not meet goals if you are over on calories.\n\nIt's not a BS way to measure food. We burn calories. The only actual, long term way to lose weight is to introduce a caloric deficit, and the only way to gain weight is to have a caloric surplus. To maintain, you have to have a caloric balance. \n\nWe can have different ways to induce caloric deficits - binging and purging, fiber pills to fill the stomach so we can't eat too much, lap bands, gastric bypass, stimulants, low-carb to remove carb calories, inducing ketosis to change our metabolism, one meal a day, intermittent fasting, South Beach diet, Weight Watchers, Atkins... exercise. There are various ways of inducing caloric deficits. Essentially, that's literally every single diet ever.\n\nHonestly, setting a calorie limit based on your BMR and activity level and then matching your macros to that caloric limit is the absolutely healthiest way to diet, because it doesn't say 'cut out huge swaths of your diet you can't eat butter/ bread/ red meat.'\n\nIt just means you go, 'oh, wow, 6oz of top sirloin is 400 calories. I can't eat that and a baked potato with butter or sour cream. I get sirloin *or* baked potato. I need a big salad on the side. If I trim all the fat, it's about 300-320 calories. I can have like one roasted red potato if I trim the fat, along with my salad. I'm trimming the fat to cut calories, so I get a potato.' Or, you leave the fat and eat 100-200 extra calories and decide to take a long walk, moderate run, or nice bike ride. You realize a lot of vegetables are near zero calories and you can pack a ton of nutrients and fiber and bulk your diet on leafy greens. You can't have a porterhouse steak every week. You have a cheat day where you give yourself a treat you don't count.\n\nYou think about *how* you fuel yourself adequately.\n\nNo, you can't eat 800-1400 calories of McDonalds. But calories and then matching your actual macro needs is how to diet *without* crash dieting. Spinach has tons of iron without fat and calories like red meat. Kidney beans. Lentils. Lots of ways without red meat. You can properly fuel and looking at calories doesn't blanket ban food groups. Eat a cookie. Take your dog for a walk. You can always have a treat, you just have to balance your activity to your intake. Nothing is off-limits.\n\nCICO is a very good way to think of your diet.", "Like adding avocado, for example.", "Maybe she just wants some pasta once in awhile....OPs definition of unhealthy is definitely lacking.", "OP says. Click in the username...", "Okay well that's his problem then.   You can't demand someone make one meal for you a day to meet all of your caloric requirements when you're working a labor intensive job.   Be a grown up and eat like a normal person.", "It's insane the difference. I used to work a desk job where I skipped breakfast, ate a salad and small amount of protein for lunch, and then had a relatively normal dinner, and I weighed about 170lbs. Then I switched to a construction job working outdoors in the Canadian winter. Between the calories burned from the physical labour and your body just trying to keep itself warm, I was eating literally 3x as much food. A full egg breakfast, big snack on our first break of the day, a massive lunch, then a massive dinner and usually snacks through the evening and I still lost 25lbs. It was unbelievable.", "Yeah, this place is a trainwreck, I can't believe anyone would take the advice/ comments on here seriously. And the people on here think that the consensus of a bunch of biased, bitter, basement dwellers actually means they hold the correct opinion, it laughable at best. This is not to say that they're aren't well thought out comments, but the average is unhinged people that mostly project their own problems onto a story.", "Apparently, I'm the only one in this comment chain who doesn't get confused by terms like \"maltodextrin\" on food labels.", "He also mentioned gym and \u2018other hobbies\u2019 dude is a bodybuilder so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he was spending 2-4 hours a day at the gym."]}
