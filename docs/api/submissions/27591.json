She complained that it was unfair that i wouldn't cook for her even though I stayed home all day.

Eg, my dad basically only eats vegetables and they aren't always well-formed, because he doesn't really care about the texture it's just fuel for him. If this is how OP's meals are (like, classic gym bro plain chicken and rice and veg with no sauce or w/e) I think it's fair for the wife to ask he find a way to sometimes feed her food that she likes.", "iirc he wasn't eating much breakfast or lunch and wanted to have a big meal in the evening.", "Depending on his job it wouldn't be enough. When I'm doing labor I need around 3000 calories a day or I start losing weight.", "Except the example of the construction worker in the comment you're replying to, right?", "No everyone lives in America. Those foods are actually healthy everywhere else.", "Except cheese, bread, bagels, ham, peanut butter and cereal don't have to be over processed/have added sugar. You're the one making that assumption. There are healthier versions of all of these foods available. Have you literally never had bread that doesn't have sugar in it? Natural peanut butter? Homemade granola? Ham from a butcher instead of pre-packaged deli meat? Aged cheddar instead of processed Kraft slices?", "Look everyone! Someone who has never been to a grocery store!", "Someone failed label reading 101. Healthy versions of all of these do exist. Lmao.", "Feel free to disagree with my judgment or opinion. I don\u2019t take it personally. \n\nHow we eat in our house is not your concern but I appreciate your perspective.", "So what the do you do during the day??", "There's roughly 7-8 hours the kid is at school.  You're telling me cooking and cleaning the house takes 7 hours every single day?", "Well, watching one 9y old is easy. After age of 7, majority of children become kind of nice to handle.", "OP stated he does all the chores. If a SAHM say that we would believe her, but you doubt probably because he is a man, which is not fair at all. And she is asking for unhealthy food, not for slightly different condiments.", "He could be just good at doing that. And maybe the gym offer childcare while he is training (I know a few gyms that have that benefit)", "Funny how no one is asking if she contributes to child care either like many do when the dude seems more AHish", "The mystery of where the food that teenage boys consume goes still remains to be unsolved hahaha", "its just more lean meat and healthy carbs for energy not really optimised for for minimum calories or anything I dont think the child has a problem with it they seem to like the food and the doctors havent found any deficiencies", "\u201cUnhealthy\u201d could be a joke. Not everything is literal. As in (said mischievously) \u201cLet\u2019s live dangerously and eat some crap tonight!!!\u201d\n\nBut his post does smack of martyrdom. I\u2019m sorry, I worked full time (not from home, commuted 1 he each way) cooked for five, took care of parents and MIL, and never blinked. It\u2019s called life.\n\nNice that he throws his wife under the bus. I\u2019m getting man turning 40 ready to get a sports car vibes.", "Yeah, does he go to the gym every day? They can maybe find a compromise and on the days he doesn\u2019t he can cook other food for her", "Yeah when I was doing heavy farm labor I ate about twice the amount I do now, and was thinner. People who do desk work don't realize.", "That was an example of a woman who was criticized because she was **literally not giving her husband the calories he needed**.\n\nHOW is that comparable to the current situation?\n\nIf OP is not giving his daughter the requisite calories both he and his wife are awful people. Him for doing it and her for focusing on the taste of the food instead of the health of the child.\n\nUnless you're prepared to assert that OP is leaving out MASSIVE portions of his conversations with his wife/completely misleading us, I think its safe to assume the child is not going hungry.", "The example of the construction worker was a poor one because the wife was not providing that man with sufficient calories. That is not the case here.", "I'd bet my paycheck she lives in America or Canada.", "Look at the grocery stores in America. 95% of it processed garbage and bullshit.  This person is choosing the easiest slap together meals she can and calling it cooking.  There's a roughly zero percent chance she's sourcing and making her own things.\n\nThe bread I eat is baked at home on the weekends.", "*less unhealthy\n\nPeanut butter is fine.  Store bought bread is almost universally garbage.\n\nProcessed lunch meats and cheese on sugar bread isn't a balanced meal for a child.  It's lazy parenting and shitty habits.", "It wasn't my concern at all until you tried to use it to justify OP being bad for not cooking a whole additional meal because you think slapping a shitty sandwich together is the same as chopping and roasting vegetables and preparing healthy, lean meats.", "Working a office job isnt exactly back breaking labour either my guy"]}
