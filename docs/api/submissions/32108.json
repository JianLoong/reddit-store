I'm seeing the same thing with my siblings (M2, F8 and F13) and brought up in the argument that she could at least find time to spend with them. I mentioned a card game, watching a movie together or even just pushing my little brother on the swing, all things I know they or I would love because we all just want a relationship with her.\n\nHer response to this was straight away that I was trying to \"manipulate\" her into thinking she's a bad person and that the reason we have no relationship is because we have different interests. She said that she has plenty of friends and a fiance so the problem is not her but me. She also implied that she does not need to have a relationship with me because she has these other friendships.\n\nShe kept comparing the situation to what happened with my dad, who had an affair, saying that he made the same arguments.  I don't know how to feel about this because she has spent my whole childhood explaining that he is a terrible person, so it was very hurtful hearing this comparison - though she uses it against me often.\n\nI don't know whether to be mad at her as she isn't abusive and keeps a roof over my head but at times I feel like that's all she does and she has called me \"needy\" for wanting something more than that. Am I needy and an asshole for bringing this up or is it fair for me to want an actual relationship with my mum?", "created_utc": 1701412413, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/188573l/aita_for_being_upset_at_my_mum_for_not_wanting_a/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is for your own mental health.  It is not your problem that your mother is cold to you. I know how much it hurts because my daughter doesn't have a relationship with me.  I've accepted that finally.  For me. I have a beautiful granddaughter and her children.  You are worth much more than your mothers distance.  Love who loves you.  Only. If your mother wants to change later, only you make the decision. Love yourself more then she can not appear to love you.  I just want you to love yourself.", "NTA. She is abusive; you\u2019re literally describing it. You didn\u2019t miss out on anything; it was never there. I\u2019m really sorry you don\u2019t really have a mom.", "NTA\n\nIt's fair for you to want that, but unfortunately if she isn't willing to make an effort that isn't going to be possible. Her implying that she \"doesn't need to have a relationship with you because she has other friends\" is weird. She's making it about herself and isn't concerned about your feelings at all. Her comparing you to your dad (someone who betrayed her and someone who she clearly has a very negative opinion of) is again EXTREMELY weird. The nicest thing I can say about your mom is that she is very emotionally immature. You told her how you felt. You can't really do anything else if she refuses to listen, but you have every right to feel upset.", "I\u2019m sorry that your mom doesn\u2019t see the problem between the two of you. Almost more so that she is continuing the same path with your siblings. You are NTA for wanting a relationship. That said, it is a two way street and if she isn\u2019t willing then it isn\u2019t going to happen. \n\nWithout taking over the role of mother, please let your siblings know you are there for them. Someone that is stable in their lives. Take the time to do the things you wish your mom would do with them. It will have a huge impact in their lives.", "You are NTA at all but your mom certainly is. She seems to have totally missed the whole concept of being a parent if she thinks she doesn\u2019t need to have a connection with you because she already has friends.\n\nIt sounds like, unfortunately, she just associates you with your dad because you simply existing reminds her of him. \n\nOne thing I\u2019ve learned is not to waste your time, energy, or effort on people who don\u2019t reciprocate. Focus on developing solid relationships with your siblings. Try to forge a greater bond with your grandma. Remember that family doesn\u2019t have to be blood and there are lots of us out here that share those bonds with our found families rather than those we were born into. And remember as you both get older, when she starts whining about needing help or money or someone to tend to her - you don\u2019t owe her anything. You don\u2019t have to dedicate your time and attention to her just for her to use you. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry your mom is so indifferent, and even against, developing more of a bond with you and your siblings. You sound kind and thoughtful and she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s missing! Chin up and focus on the other people in your world who want to give you the same love and attention that you want to give to them. You should never have to beg or ask for someone\u2019s attention and you should never have to sacrifice yourself or your needs to get it either. People who expect you to do that are not worth the attention, no matter how much it may hurt and you want to fill that hole. You\u2019ll find your pack. Hang in there.", "Your mother's response to your feelings seems to lack empathy and understanding. It's important in any relationship, especially a parent-child one, to listen and try to understand each other's emotional needs", "NTA: \"Your feelings are valid. Wanting a closer relationship with your mother is completely normal, and it's not manipulative to express your feelings. It's unfortunate that she's not receptive to your needs", "Your attempt to communicate your feelings and needs to your mother is a healthy approach. Her response, however, seems dismissive and doesn't acknowledge your valid emotional needs", "nta", "NTA. \n\nI am sending you hugs. \n\nIt is natural of course to want some relationship with the person who gave birth to you, who raised you, who loved and cared for you. This rejection is incredibly painful and will continue to hurt, I wager, for years to come. It is a difficult thing to accept. \n\nRead about attachment styles. I bet you find that the description of an avoidant attachment style resembles your mother, and your experience of your relationship with her. Maybe see a therapist? \n\nGood luck.", "Absolutely NAH  \nCalling someone needy for wanting basic emotional connection and family bonding time is unfair. It's natural to want to have a meaningful relationship with your parents", "NAH  \nIt sounds like there's a fundamental difference in how you and your mother perceive and value family relationships. Neither of you are wrong, but it's clear there's a mismatch in expectations and emotional needs", "**NAH**  \nIt seems like there's a deep communication gap between you and your mother. Both of you have different views on family dynamics, and that's okay. It might be helpful to seek a family therapist to bridge this gap", "if she doesnt want a relationship with you, or your siblings, thats her loss. honestly, just give up on her and move on.

Feeling rejected by a parent can be emotionally devastating and I suspect your mother is emotionally neglectful.", "NTA it sounds like she doesn\u2019t want to be a mother. Also, maybe your Dad wasn\u2019t a bad guy but genuinely iced out.", "I wonder if OP's father was right about how the mother is in relationships. Obviously he expressed that the wrong way, but it's kinda telling he had the same issues OP is having now.", "it's important to consider that understanding and accepting these differences can be a crucial step in navigating your relationship with your mother. It may help to approach the situation with empathy for her perspective, while also acknowledging your own feelings as valid. Finding a middle ground or a way to communicate effectively about these differences could be beneficial. It might also be helpful to seek external support, like counseling, to facilitate better understanding and communication between you two", "there's different views, and there's just being a bad parent. this one seems closer to the latter.", "Definitely possible!
