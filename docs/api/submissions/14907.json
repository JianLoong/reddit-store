I don\u2019t know maybe I should\u2019ve asked around to see if someone wanted them, but I also wanted to have fun with my friends and girlfriend.

You're under no obligation to offer up a gift to \"someone who would appreciate it more\". NTA", "NTA. Those tickets were given to you. You used them. Doesn\u2019t matter if you aren\u2019t a fan. That person has no right to gatekeep Taylor Swift concerts. Also, you had fun, so the tickets were not wasted just because you didn\u2019t know the music. \n\nA lot of non-fans go to concerts of people they don\u2019t know, only to become fans afterwards. That is one way the artists get more fans. This old co-worker of yours was out of line and acting entitled. If you aren\u2019t close, I suggest just blocking her.", "NTA. They were a gift.

Everyone who saw the message would want them, and be pissed when you gave them to someone else. No win situation. Glad you enjoyed the show! Maybe Taylor made a new fan or two out of the 4 of you.", "NTA - and I say this as a huge Swiftie! Sucks for the other people but it\u2019s not your problem, and tickets are still available from resellers (and yes they\u2019re $$$$) if they\u2019re absolutely dying to go. \n\nGlad you got to go and hope you had a great time\u2014whether you know her music or not, I don\u2019t think anyone denies she puts on a great show!", "NTA - Why do these people feel that they have a right to the tickets? You barely know them! You did nothing wrong, you received a gift and you enjoyed it. They are the entitled assholes who think they're owed something just because they can't afford it. That's not how shit works.", "NTA. You were interested in going to the concert and you had tickets that were gifted to you. Just because someone else would have enjoyed them more doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re obligated to give the tickets away/ sell them.", "NTA!!! You were gifted the tickets and they were yours to use however you wanted! Imagine if the client found out you gave the gift away, he/she might not have been very happy about it.\n\nThis ex coworker from years ago is very entitled to think you should have give her those tickets even though you aren't friends and haven't met her daughters. For all you know she could have been lying and would have sold the tickets for a good amount of money. I am so sick of this culture we have about people feeling other should just give them things because they want them!\n\nDo not feel bad, they were your tickets!!! I am glad you went and had fun!", "NTA Your allowed to keep your gift even if it\u2019s not something that you wanted.

If it was that important to her, she should have done whatever it took to get tickets. From what I\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s been pretty easy to find tickets for resale. They\u2019re not cheap but they\u2019re not out-of-reach expensive either. This leech just wanted a handout. Block her.", "NTA she\u2019s behaving like she\u2019s entitled to them.

And it would\u2019ve been nice if you had found fabs to give them to, but the woman crying about her daughters is the AH. Her situation in life has nothing to do with you and she\u2019s crazy to think trying to make you feel guilty will accomplish anything. I\u2019d just block her.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nReminds me of people who want stuff being sold in classifieds for free, and get mad that people want to charge for it...\n\nUnless they're paying your bills, they aren't entitled to be offered anything, no matter the sob story.", "NTA. They were yours, you used them, and you enjoyed yourself.", "NTA. \n\nYour tickets, you can do what you want with them.\n\nYou could've sold them, give them away, ripped them up and you still wouldn't be TA.", "NTA - You were under no obligation to give them up, and your client probably would've been mad if they found out you did. So you did the right thing and went and enjoyed yourself. I say this as a Taylor fan. \n\nGetting tickets to the show was super tough, so everyone who hasn't been able to get them have been super in their feelings about it, but that doesn't excuse them yelling at you and saying you owed them to a fan. It'd be one thing if you had someone very close to you who you knew was a super fan, but people you vaguely know? Come on.", "NTA.", "NTA. Not even a little.", "NTA. By this logic I assume everyone who told you you should give the tickets away also give everything of theirs away.  By their logic there's always someone out there who likes the thing you have more than you...so they should be giving all of their things away to someone \"more deserving\" how many homeless people do you think they give their guest rooms to? NTA.", "Lol NTA by that logic only the most die hard fans should go to any concert. She is being entitled and delusional, I would take this as all the reason I need to block and never talk to again", "Tell them we are never ever getting back together so I can hand over MY tickets. NTA", "NTA. Glad you had fun. \n\nThose people are good candidates for r/gatekeeping", "Nta that are your tickets and you can decide how to use it . But was not smart sell the tickets for resale value and gain big money and time.", "NTA but honestly it's weird you could have sold them to fans that had a hard time getting them which everyone knows and used the money to go to something you actually like", "NTA. Old coworker needs to shake it off! A LOT of Taylor Swift fans were unable to get tickets so her situation isn\u2019t special. Also it would\u2019ve been rude to give away a gift. I\u2019m glad you went and had a good time!", "I assume not accepting generous gifts isn\u2019t a good way to show your appreciation for their business. nta", "NTA but Taylor Swift tickets are going for a lot of money. You could have sold them and made a small fortune.  My sister had 2 tickets for an upcoming Taylor Swift concert in my city and she sold them for over $1k each (they cost her about $300 each).", "NTA but you should have seen this backlash coming. Especially when you posted about going and wrote that you weren't really a big fan. I don't know if you're aware but... Taylor Swift fans are a very dedicated bunch and tickets for this tour have been notoriously hard to buy. You are NTA for accepting the tickets and going, but Y kinda TA for posting about it the way you did.", "You do realize that Taylor is now going to be forced to write a song about you since you confessed to not being a fan.  \n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have seen a number of bands that I am not a fan of but enjoyed their live show. There are countless bands who you will never see me listening too, but I would 100% see them live again. There are bands I didn\u2019t see at a point in time that I regret not seeing. You don\u2019t have to love a band to have a good time and enjoy a performance. Hell, that might be what turns you into a fan. The hype and chaos around this tour builds it up to be a something special. Why would you not take the opportunity to experience that? \n\nIf you were interested, of course you might give them to someone who would knew the artist more. But you\u2019re under no obligation to sacrifice the tickets you got because someone else likes the artist more. Not enough, not easy to get, too expensive tickets is Taylor Swift and Ticket Masters fault, not yours. \n\nI saw one of my wife\u2019s bucket list bands on our honeymoon in Amsterdam when they announced their first tour in a while. I don\u2019t listen to them, but i like them and neither of us has seen them. It was a great show and I\u2019m glad I experienced it.  A few months later my wife also had tickets for a show in a local city (that she got for free). I decided that since I had seen them earlier on the tour, I would give my ticket to a friend of ours who loved them and hadn\u2019t seen them. They went to the concert and me and her wife chilled in the city til they needed picked up. I would 100% see this band again, but having already seen them once a few months before, I wanted someone else to experience it.

Instead you chose to go and enjoy yourself and that was absolutely fine too.\n\nThe only version of this scenario that would be less than ideal is if you skipped the show without finding another home for the tickets.\n\nIf it had been me, I would have likely sold them at a fair price.
