There is no such thing as betrayal when it comes to food and taking care of your self. Lol", "No, ~~Y T A~~  NTA\n\nYou're brother was fired *with cause*.   If he had been fired 'just because' then it *might* be a betrayal.  But not if his employer had a valid reason to fire him.\n\nEdit: Put in the wrong judgment,  thank you u/ReidingChase for pointing that out for me\n\nEat from where you want to eat from.", "That is my feeling as well.

So, not a teen, for sure.", "I know it's a joke, but, quite frankly, it's never come up before. I couldn't really eat at the other places that he worked at previously. There *may* have been a token item, but I was also wary of cross contamination.\n\nAt this place, not only can you watch them cook your food, there are different sections, cooking surfaces, utensils, etc for different food groups, potential allergens, etc.", "We're in the U.S.\n\nHe was a manager and started dating a server. It is against company policy for managers to date subordinates.", "You might want to change your Y T A to a NTA if you meant they weren't the ass", "You might want to re-read.", "NTA! At all.

It's uncommon here though. Generally frowned upon, sure. But a fireable offence? No.", ">But a fireable offence? No.\n\nEven when the company has an existing policy about it?\n\nIn the US companies can fire employees at-will, as long as it's not discriminating on a protected characteristic.  If the company policy says \"don't do X\" and you do X anyway, legally speaking it's just cause for firing.  Morally speaking, a manager dating a subordinate is at best tricky to navigate well -- even if they're discreet, it's hard to shake the appearance of favoritism, and if the relationship ends will the workplace implode? \n\nI don't know how much my perception of what's ok/normal is influenced by being in the US with its shitty work culture, but I don't find this particular point shitty.", "We both have our opinions I guess. Glad I don't work in the States. It sounds like an even shittier work culture than up here.\n\nIt's inevitable that relationships form when people are close. It's up to them to self-regulate the effects out of the workplace. I do agree that it could be difficult to navigate with a direct subordinate. Transfers to other departments or locations are options. Firing with cause for something that is inevitable (and depending on your perspective - none of anyone's fucking business) strikes me as unnecessary and invasive.", "NTA. He shouldn't have gotten himself fired in the first place.", "To my knowledge,  there isn't a Bro Code/Girl Code with jobs.  This is so NTA. As a manager, he knows the rules better than anyone (or should), and you can bet his idescretions are going to be way more obvious than anyone else's.  He blatantly disregarded the rules and got fired, that's on him, and shouldn't impact your ability to enjoy a meal. NTA", "NTA for going there. YTA for not saying why he was fired. We need context for why he\u2019s angry.", "Thank you!\nThe food is delicious and I have choices!", "He was a manager and started dating a server. It is against company policy for a manager to date a subordinate.\n\nThis was over a year ago. He has another job.", "well if he was fired for being gay or they were abusive to him or if he saw some racism and spoke up about it and then he got fired, or they stole tips and he called it out, or he found out they were doing something else illegal and he wanted to stop it and he got fired, then i would think his sibling would boycott the place.", "Damn, you're right I did mean NTA.  Thanks, edited now :)", "Ehhhh- you\u2019re not the AH for going there. Are they still together?", "No.\n\nHe's since gotten married to someone else.", "As in he was fired without just cause I think they were saying possibly? Not sure myself.", "Wow- he moves fast. Finding places with good vegan option is hard.", "(If it's inevitable then why isn't every employee in a workplace romance? ;) )\n\nI agree it's inevitable that *closeness* can develop, but that's not the same thing as dating; it's the distinction between relationship and Relationship.  Plus there's a difference between coworkers dating and boss/subordinate dating.  The latter raises conflict-of-interest issues and power imbalance issues.  It's similar to why teachers shouldn't get involved with their students (at least while actively teaching them. \n\nIt also depends on how much the dating relationship affects the job.  A couple who are discreet and professional is less risky than a couple who take smooching breaks at work.  A boss who goes to HR (if a large company) saying \"I would like to begin seeing X romantically, how can we rearrange things so they aren't under my supervision\" shows better judgment than a boss who, when questioned, says \"lol it's okay I didn't coerce them\".\n\nI think the places here (US) that try to prohibit *any* workplace romance are extreme, for basically the reasons you state, and there are definitely \"shitty but perfectly legal reasons for firing; but at the same time I tend to agree with \"don't date subordinates\" rules.  I also don't have the details of how things went down in this case (what options there were, whether the restaurant even had multiple locations, how cooperative everyone was, whether the response was \"you have several chances to fix this\" or just \"no you're fired\", etc)  \n\n\n> It sounds like an even shittier work culture than up here.\n\nLoool yep. It doesn't matter how bad you think US work culture is, something somewhere will inevitably prove it's really worse.\n\nOut of curiosity where's \"here\" for you?", "I\u2019d say NAH.\n\nYou have no real details about why your brother was fired, and even if you say it was \u201cwith cause\u201d it\u2019s impossible for us to properly judge that.\n\nYou\u2019re not an asshole for eating at a place that has good food options for you.\n\nYour brother also isn\u2019t an asshole for being upset though. Is he maybe a little too into his own feelings? Yeah. Was he maybe being a little dramatic? Yeah. But he wasn\u2019t being an asshole either.\n\nThis just comes across as mostly petty sibling drama that could be solved with a convo or two about y\u2019all\u2019s feelings.", "Well as the restaurant didn't nothing wrong you shouldn't punish them and yourself for your brother mistakes. NTA", "NTA.. if they had good reason to fire him then you are not being disloyal.  I'm glad you found a restaurant you can eat at. I'm confused when I have a full menu. There is one restaurant I will drive to that is 100% gluten free and even people that can eat gluten, love it.", "Well, if you're the A H, so am I (and my husband), because we regularly eat at a caf\u00e9 our son was fired from - partly because they have a number of items I, with multiple allergies, can eat. So the cases are parallel. \n\nNTA. Your life shouldn't lose richness because your brother made mistakes. \n\nps my son doesn't mind us going there at all."]}
