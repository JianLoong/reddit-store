Middle one is 10, she\u2019s my bonus daughter. Youngest one is 6 she is biologically mine with my wife. This is about the middle child, though. With only a week before Christmas break, she was suspended along with two classmates. My wife at home with our youngest asked me to handle it. \n\nThis was her first suspension, she was in the principal\u2019s office when I arrived and was obviously scared. She not only truthfully stated her involvement, but took responsibility for her actions by acknowledging she was wrong. I was proud of her for doing that, this is what we taught our children. But that didn\u2019t let her off the hook. On the way home I told her this suspension doesn\u2019t mean vacation. She\u2019s to do her schoolwork and regular chores, no video games, and I took her phone away. This is for the full duration of the suspension since they basically suspended her for the remainder of the semester. \n\nWhen we got home, I discussed everything in with my wife. She said the punishment was too weak. I reminded her she told me to handle it, which I did. Anything harsher would just make her want to lie next time to protect herself, honestly. My wife felt it was necessary to add to the punishment, she went through her gifts and returned basically everything. She kept necessities like clothes and shoes. \n\nShe didn\u2019t even bother to tell me until after she made the returns. It would have ruined her Christmas, honestly mine too and probably the other kids seeing her sad. So I bought everything back minus one item I\u2019m still trying to find since it\u2019s sold out everywhere. I brought the gifts home and told my wife it\u2019s not right to take her Christmas away. She\u2019s just a child and children make stupid choices all the time. After all, the kid knows she did wrong. \n\nShe didn\u2019t really say anything, didn\u2019t appear upset either. The next day I came home to my dresser, nightstand, my side of the closet and my toolboxes ransacked. I then caught her going through my truck\u2026looking for the receipts. Honestly I was pissed, the fact she didn\u2019t even ask for the receipts but tried to find them behind my back to yet again return everything. Plus the disrespect of going through my stuff like that and leaving a mess, I have never done that to her. I probably should have walked away to cool off but instead ripped into her which caused a huge fight. \n\nThis kid isn\u2019t one to get in trouble, this is the first big thing and I feel my wife is overreacting. My niece has done far worse and basically had the same consequence as I gave my daughter. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair, my wife thinks I\u2019m undermining her by rebuying the gifts. She says the consequences I gave aren\u2019t enough to teach a lesson, her idea of snatching Christmas away, she believes will send a message.

In addition to the school\u2019s consequence, I gave her limitations and expectations while at home during her suspension. My wife said this wasn\u2019t enough to teach her a lesson, however I felt it was justifiable. My wife I suppose wanted to add her form of punishment, which basically eliminated the child\u2019s Christmas gifts except for needed items. I did not agree with this, I felt my wife did it in a sneaky manner so I purchased the gifts back. She didn\u2019t seem upset at first but later told me how wrong I was for buying the gifts back. I think I might be the asshole here because I did technically override her authority and decision.

You accidentally forgot to empty the dishwasher twice in one week? Too bad, you\u2019re not getting Christmas this year. You got a low grade on your math test? No birthday party for you. If my mother hadn\u2019t fought him on those ridiculously out-of-proportion punishments, my brother and I would\u2019ve missed out on many, many holidays. We were constantly walking on eggshells to be \u201cperfect\u201d because we were afraid to have our childhood experiences taken away. Your wife is doing this for a reason. You need to sit down and have a serious conversation about the effects this will have on your daughter. Does she honestly believe this is something your daughter will benefit from behavior-wise? I don\u2019t think so. Dig more into the root cause, because it\u2019s alarming she\u2019s trying to normalize this. NTA.", "Your wife needs therapy. Clearly she had this done to her by her parents and the trauma is still there. \n\nNTA. You did everything well, I would just add that I feel the punishment should really reflect what she was suspended for. For example, if she punched some kid and they got hurt, I'd take her to the hospital to volunteer or to the homeless shelter (all supervised and accompanied by you, of course). So she doesn't just get punished for being bad, but she actively works on becoming a better person overall.", "NTA - if you rebuying the gifts undermines her, then her getting involved undermines you. She\u2019s asked you to handle it, you did - and in a well thought out, adult way. She escalated it to a point that was unnecessary - while undermining you. She needs some self reflection.", "NTA.\n\nReturning Christmas gifts as a punishment is incredibly fucked up and extreme. Taking away screens during suspension is a reasonable and acceptable punishment. Your wife needs mental health services, ASAP.", ">She said the punishment was too weak\n\nNTA.  How so?  Your daughter knows she did wrong, admitted to everything, probably understands the severity of what she did (suspensions aren't light things and most kids are generally aware of that) so what is the point of throwing more grief on her other than sadism.\n\nChristmas is a once a year thing, the \"magic\" dissipates the older we get.  Your wife is trying to torpedo a rare occasion for a child who is generally well behaved.  That doesn't sound like trying to correct behaviour to me, it is just a punishment for the self-satisfying sadistic urge to give out punishments.", "NTA, but you guys really need to have a discussion on what\u2019s expected because your wife is overreacting if you\u2019re being fully honest about the situation. Using big holidays and gifts as a form of punishment sets the wrong tone and can create a really unhealthy dynamic. Is your wife usually harder on this child vs the others?", "NTA! That big of a punishment your wife tried to give her would have made her despite her mom, and as you said, would have encouraged her to lie the next time.", "NTA..She admitted what she did and acknowledged she was wrong. Your punishment seems quite fair and your wife's was over the top. She wanted to ruin her Christmas? I could see this if she was constantly in trouble but she isn't.", "NTA - Your approach seems right to me. Plus, your wife asked you to handle it, so she doesn't really get to decide this.", "NTA.\n\nWife overstepped by being more punitive when she asked you to handle it, and especially sketchy for going behind your back.\n\nYou mentioned the middle is your \"bonus\" child. What does that mean exactly? It feels like your wife is projecting jealousy or anger issues onto the kid, when you two need to work it out.\n\nAnd the wife clearly undermined you first with returning the gifts.", "NTA\n\nINFO: It's hard to determine if your response was appropriate without knowing what your daughter did to warrant the suspension.  I'm leaning towards NTA, as your wife's response does seem extreme and even if your punishment wasn't enough, there are likely other better ways to address the behavior.  But again, that depends on what your daughter did.", "NTA but your wife has major issues. Your daughter was curious about some fireworks and the kids wrongfully thought water would put them out. I've done worse at that age. This is hardly an offense to ruin Christmas over.", "NTA. The suspension was the punishment and you took it further by telling her she needed to apply herself during the suspension. Your wife went way overboard and that is extremely cruel. Do you know why she would go to such extremes? It seems like your daughter has essentially already learned her lesson so what was your wife hoping to teach through this hurtful action?", "NTA - She is acting extreme toward you and the daughter. You are not the ahole for rebuying gifts. This issue seems to reflect something bigger.  How did you both raise three girls and all of a sudden she went from 0 to 100% to embarrass and demean your child? Suspensions are to be learning experiences which she tasked you to do. No need to scorch the earth. Something has tipped your wife to be unreasonable. Protect all 3 children cause she is not balanced to do so.", "NTA - Agree with a lot of the other commenters and want to add that your wife is the one who undermined you. If she\u2019s going to change your punishment then she should not have told you to handle it in the first place.", "NTA. She delegated to you, and I think you handled it firmly and appropriately. She needs to back you on this, not try to make things worse for her daughter. Her idea is terrible, frankly.", "NTA, your initial punishment was enough, especially as she owned up and took responsibility for her actions. If it were my kid the only way I would even entertain the idea of taking away their Christmas was if they had harmed or bullied another child, or had caused damage that I had to pay to repair/replace.", "NTA Your wife sounds like a mean mean mom, and an asshole!", "NTA.   Your wife asked you to handle it.  You did.   The drama regarding the presents has little to do with niece and everything to do with the power dynamics between you and your wife.  Instead of working as a team you are actively at war with each other.   Could very well be your last Christmas together.", "NTA\n\nWhat you did seemed enough consequence for your daughter. You had a conversation with her, took away her phone, which honestly should be enough because kids can\u2019t live without their phones! LoL. Your daughter already seemed remorseful and accepted the consequences of her actions \n\nYour wife went extreme. She went all grinch! She returned all the gifts and tried to steal the stuff you bought to return!  It\u2019s worse when you mentioned that your niece has done way worse things, yet wasn\u2019t even punished the same way!  Why does she want to torture your daughter that much?!!\n\nYou were also correct that making the consequence the way your wife wanted WOULD make your daughter lie in the future and not talk to either of you if/when she\u2019s in trouble. Or even if she just needed someone to talk to because she would feel judge by you both.\n\nYou and your wife have a huge issue here..... and it\u2019s not just about the daughter.", "NTA, taking away gifts is way too harsh.  But, why is she so lenient on the older kiddo and so harsh on the middle one?", "NTA. I want you to understand and make your wife understand that this shit is why, as adults, many of us are estranged from one or both parents. We keep a mental tally, and when she's old enough, she'll leave. My dad was an overreacting asshole about everything, I was always punished way harder than siblings, and I noticed. I left as soon as I could and didn't speak to him for years. That's her future. \n\nShe is unhinged right now. She wants to intentionally hurt her at xmas to \"teach\" her a lesson. That's fucking cruel, cruel, cruel. Wtf man?", "NTA. I think taking away Christmas is too harsh for a 10 year old. However, I think your wife may be right about the punishment not being harsh enough too, depending on what she was suspended for. At least around here, you have to do something pretty bad to get out of school suspension for a full week, especially on your first offense. It is almost unheard of with an elementary student.  Maybe have here volunteer somewhere for the days she was suspended or several days over the break or have extra work she has to do around the house.", "NTA and you are married to the Grinch! Your wife told you to handle it, you did, and now she\u2019s saying you are undermining HER? That\u2019s rich. \n\nFrom everything you said, you have a good kid there who made a bad decision. Taking away her whole Christmas is cruel and unnecessary. Your wife violating and making a mess of your area is also unnecessary. \n\nI am 100% on your side OP and I hope you\u2019re able to keep the Grinch from stealing Christmas!", "info: what did she do?", "NTA. Return the presents you bought for your wife. She should have Christmas canceled for her since she ransacked your stuff.", "Your wife asked you to deal with it and you did.\n\nShe went overboard.", "Your wife isn't right in the head.\n\nNTA.", "You are NTA. I get so upset in this sub when I see people trying to justify withholding gifts from kids at Christmas. She is a child. She did something stupid, as kids do. It *might* be different if she was defiant and not remorseful, but she\u2019s not. She\u2019s taking responsibility - like an adult. I\u2019m honestly proud of her for that. Your wife needs to buy a vowel.", "NTA... The child might need a bigger punishment, but ruining Christmas isn't the one...  I'm not sure what the message might be, but I guarantee that she would remember it for a life time and probably be hurt by her mothers action for just as long", "NTA. Your daughter had remorse, took responsibility, and you didn\u2019t shield her from the consequences of her actions (suspension). Even if your wife had another reasonable response in mind, taking away gifts (which is generally not a good way to go about raising kids) without talking to you was not ok. \n\nHave you and your wife had issues with discipline before?", "NTA - Depending on how long is left in the semester it might be illegal for the school to suspend her for that long. Where I live the district needs to reasonably provide an equitable education, even if that meant alternative placement. \n\nI do agree that your wife is taking to the next fucking level though. Which will only cause resentment. Good on you for being the best father you can be!", "INFO: What was you niece suspended for?", "NTA\n\nYour daughter showed remorse for her actions, and your wife's response to your punishment is to ruin Christmas for everyone? That's so freaking whacked. You're 100% right. Any further punishment would encourage her to hide it next time. You set the record straight by establishing that this was a punishment period and not a vacation to her. Your daughter understood. Idk what's going on with your wife, but she's off her rocker with this overreaction.\n\nI think going forward, you and your wife need to get on the same page about punishment with your kids. You need to tell your wife that the next time she says, \"You to handle it,\" that she needs to back up your decisions and support you. She undermined your discretion and authority as a father, and that's not ok. Not to mention her blatant disregard and respect for your possessions.", "Info: what did she do?", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nWhen your wife said \"handle it,\" surely she meant \"go to the school because I'm home with the younger kid\"---not that she was washing her hands of any involvement in the situation.  The two of you should have discussed **and agreed** on the consequences before announcing them to your daughter.\n\nSuspension for that long, and the fact that your wife thinks the consequences are too little, that sounds like a serious school problem. What exactly happened? \n\nYour wife's reaction seems pretty over the top, but yours might be just as wrong on the lenient side, who knows since the \"crime\" isn't detailed. And regardless, you're both assholes for not coming to agreement instead of just thinking you could override each other.", "Suspension for the rest of the semester (as opposed to 1-3 days) means whatever middle daughter did, it was pretty serious. OP, if you didn't also ban TV, computer games, and ground her, you should consider doing so, and/or add extra chores. It's hard to say, given that we don't know the nature of the offense. (Pilfering candy from the teacher's desk vs. physically abusing or emotionally scarring another kid.)\n\nHOWEVER, taking away all her Christmas gifts is NOT a good punishment. You want to support the school's message that the behavior won't be tolerated, not show the girl SHE isn't tolerated. For all the stories about a lump of coal in the stocking, Christmas isn't really a reward for good behavior.\n\nESH. Your wife should have come to an agreement instead of returning the gifts. You should have discussed it with her before buying back gifts. She should have talked with you instead of searching for receipts. (And she wanted you to know she'd been looking, OP: hence the mess.)

Then the two of you *should* have discussed the punishment together before doling it out.\n\nWife takes it upon herself to extend the punishment, takes gifts back *without discussing it.* \n\nYou think that's unfair, so you buy gifts back *without discussing it.* \n\nI do think your punishment was fair, but honestly, do y'all ever *talk*??", "I'm going with ESH. After seeing what she did, I think your punishment is more appropriate, but y'all are both parenting this kid and need to communicate better and come to agreement about stuff like this. For example, you could have listened to her concern that she needed more punishment but then compromised (maybe one or two fun presents are returned, or maybe she has to do additional chores over break, or something). Instead you both ended up sneaking around returning and buying items and undermining each other.", "ESH\n\nDaughter for whatever she did.\nYou for believing your wife wanted you to decide how to handle it. That usually means handle it exactly like she would without consulting you.\nHer for adding to the punishment against your objection.\n\nI agree that punishment should be appropriate.\nRandom arbitrary punishment does not teach anything you want them to learn.", "ESH You're leaving out what she did, which could hugely influence our judgement. On top of that, you both need to get your shit together. It's not right for you to undermine how she parents her child by just going and re-buying the gifts.

A kid that young isn't going to put together either that a firecracker may sound like a gunshot either. A lot of of what happened just sounds like kids doing something very stupid without understanding the depths of the consequences. A suspension is a very fitting punishment for this.

The commenters saying this wouldn\u2019t be an issue pre school schooling are ignoring reality.  We now live in a society where school shootings happen way too frequently.

When one parent acts in an abusive and unreasonable fashion towards the other or the children you don't just pull the, \"I'm a cool, rational, reasonable adult who never gets angry, because anger is evil.\" No, you make them known that this behaviour won't be tolerated, and you do so firmly. She wants to talk about weak punishments, well than be verbally aggressive so she knows that you won't be \"weak\" with her if she's fuckin ransacking the house.\n\n>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair, my wife thinks I\u2019m undermining her by rebuying the gifts.

You are so NTA, but she is to a really concerning level. Why is it so important for her to actually hurt your daughter as punishment? Because that's what she's trying to do... Your punishment isn't hurtful enough for her, so she needs the kid to suffer more so she learns the lesson more?

Physical punishment was used too. The problem with adults like this is they feel they are right and cannot accept criticism. My mother was always right, if you didn't want to be treated that way don't misbehave or do x thing. Coming home after midnight at 23 = being kicked out the house. My siblings had issues when they got to their late teens, one sister dyed her hair purple and mum went missing for a few hours threatening to end her life, she thought she was right, I was disowned for getting a tattoo and defacing the body she gave me.

He can back to tell the officer who showed up he wanted to press charges and the officer said he didn\u2019t see anything and that he advises him to face the fact he got his ass kicked by an agent 17 year old and move on. Never seen that bitch ass step dick again!", "I agree with this. It's definitely situational, but OPs daughter already understands and has owned she is wrong, and would most likely be an empathetic volunteer and fit exactly what you describe.  Taking someone that has little remorse to volunteer is a disservice to the volunteering organization and the folks they're volunteering for.", "Agreed, it\u2019s definitely situational. Each kid is different, and the parent should not frame it as a punishment but an activity or learning opportunity.", "You really think people in need would prefer less volunteers and less work being done to help them, just to weed out the people who aren't doing it for the \"right reasons\"?", "Teach your kids empathy from the beginning of their lives, and they will want to help. It has nothing to do with being 'pure'. Helping humans is in our DNA, it isn't the people with empathy fault society tried to breed ot out of us.", "NTA, but you could have spoken with her first to see what compromise could have been met. There was a middle ground but neither of you could see it because the both of you were convinced that how you handled it was the only right way. Sit down and talk to your wife and figure it out before it becomes something bigger than it needs to be. \n\nP.S. Thank you for treating your bonus child fairly. As a person who was abused by both step parents, it's nice to see good ones.", "Jesus that's dangerous af", "This is one of the most accurate posts (especially the last paragraph) in this chain and I'm really befuddled why so many posts in the chain are screaming in opposition to what you/us on this side are saying", "Let\u2019s remember that this kid is 10 years old. Most volunteer organizations *cannot* accept her at that age. For instance, no animal shelter would have her working with dogs when she\u2019s younger than 18, she could be knocked over or bitten, and the liability would be astronomical. She could work at a food bank sorting canned goods, but nothing public-facing, like direct contact with the homeless, unless she was with a parent behind the line serving a meal. I don\u2019t think she could even visit the elderly until she\u2019s a teenager.", "Go touch grass. This is a horribly online take", "ETA, you should have talked to each other first to have a united front and to avoid all this. With this being the first offense and depending on what she did I would say some gifts should go back but not all the toys. You both messed up and need to calm down and talk.", "ESH. \n\nWhatever your daughter did has to be bad enough to get suspended for the rest of the semester. \n\nYour wife shouldn\u2019t have returned things without talking to you first. \n\nYou buying things back is also not the greatest choice without first having discussed with your wife. \n\nYou both should have talked about this like adults. The best compromise would have been to take some Christmas gifts back and keep a few others besides the essential items. You two just went to two extremes when there was a chance to be in the middle and teach your daughter a lesson.\n\nEdited to fix a word", "Ok, then yes I agree with your punishment. I was wondering what she could\u2019ve done to get a multiple day suspension that wasn\u2019t heinous, but this certainly qualifies. I will say though your wife went behind your back, so, seemingly, you went behind her\u2019s, so she escalated things and went behind your\u2019s in a disrespectful way. You did talk to her about your reasoning, and your reasoning is sound, but did you discuss it before or after you bought things back- it seemed like after. I\u2019d get couples counseling do you can get on the same page. NTA.", "Yea. Removing holidays is emotional abuse. It\u2019s overboard and won\u2019t teach anything but that the kid is not important or worth celebrating. \n\nMaking mistakes or choosing the wrong thing in a moment doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t deserve nice things, gifts, holidays, family time, etc.. \n\nYou gave a reasonable and proportionate consequence, meant to teach, your wife is trying to give punishment that will hurt and cause emotional damage. \n\nNTA big time, and your wife needs to gain some perspective. \n\nTalk to her about natural consequences and appropriate response to something, and remind her how hurtful and lasting those scars can be when it\u2019s not done right. \n\nThere\u2019s a really good resource I went to a lot, empowering parents (just search for the website). The guy behind it wrote a book called the total transformation. James Lehman. There are options to buy material and a whole program and etc., but as a poor single mother, I just scoped the free articles and it was amazing to have a voice of reason to turn to when I found myself unsure or feeling crazy or at my wits end. \n\nGood luck.", "Yeah but as a teacher this is about as innocuous as it can get. She didn\u2019t hurt anyone, although they were scared, she didn\u2019t bring a weapon to school (gun/knife), she didn\u2019t bully anyone. It was dumb n she got suspended for multiple days.  If she were to continue on this path she\u2019d also get expelled. You only get x number of days per year before you are up for expulsion and it sounds like she already got quite a few, probably 3-6 days. It\u2019s 10 days in a year in special ed, and I think the same in gen ed. before they consider you for expulsion.  Plus she\u2019ll get a little set of letters on her file that say she\u2019s done something wrong likely with an attached summary so every teacher will see she\u2019s considered more dangerous. So yeah it wasn\u2019t nothing, but it wasn\u2019t hateful either.", "You said you couldn't find one of the gifts, so there's the \"minus one gift\". NTA.", "Even better, it means they don't have to take responsibility for things.", ">\"She\u2019s acting out because she doesn\u2019t have her mother\u2019s love so all we can do is love her.\"\n\nIs your wife saying this in front of your 12yo adopted daughter (who's biologically your wife's sister's daughter)? It's a very weird thing to say as your adopted daughter never lived with her biological mom. You and your wife raised her for most of her life and did your best to give her a good childhood. So you and your wife are her parents and therefore your wife should be the mother who loves her.\n\nI don't understand why your wife thinks it's okay to emphasize to your adopted daughter her biological mom doesn't love her whenever she does something wrong. I think it could be emotionally damaging to hear that over and over again.\n\nI also don't understand why your wife wants to teach your adopted daughter she needs to be pitied because her biological mom doesn't love her and not face any consequences for her mistakes and (teenage) misbehavior. I don't think that's a healthy thing to teach her. And I don't understand how it helps her becoming a healthy, responsible, kind adult. Lack of proper boundaries and not putting in the effort of teaching your child things could be emotional neglect.\n\nAnd your wife is being unnecessary cruel to your 10yo stepdaughter (your wife's biological child) by wanting to take away all her Christmas presents. I think such an excessive punishment could be emotional abusive.\n\nGoing through your belongings, behind your back, to punish your stepdaughter is very weird and concerning behavior. She's purposely crossing your boundaries to punish your stepdaughter. Again, not healthy behavior. I think your wife needs therapy.\n\nedit: NTA", "I just got a vicarious surge of joy - having shit parents sucks enough and learning to stand up for yourself and the people you love is so much harder with assholes for parents.\n\nBut you *literally* took him to the mat? Fuck yeah and that cop had your back.", "There are comments in this thread from people who have been in situations of financial insecurity who are all caps saying almost unanimously that, that is exactly what they would prefer, there are studies being quoted that go in great detail as to why its not a great parenting method. \n\nI believe there is a comment from a person who explains how such behaviour leads to resentment of the underprivileged because they are associated as part of punishment and can also lead down to abuse of underprivileged people, but hey, feel free to ignore it all.", "Hey don't take my word for it, read the comments from people who have been on the receiving end of such educational moments while being underprivileged, and go tell them to touch grass lol.
