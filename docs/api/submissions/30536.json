The realistic comments he could have made were: The previous owners were horrible ppl to dump their animal / That dog is lucky to have came across you guys.\n\nFor your daughter this may be about more than a birthday party and may end up be the defining moment that she sets clear boundaries against the uncle. I hope you continue to honor them... if that is what it comes to.", "Did the dog survive?", "NTA - if he wants to come to the birthday, he needs to apologize for being an A$$.

He has no compassion. Even if the dog didnt make it, that doesnt mean that it deserved to die alone tied to a pole. Passing in a comfortable bed in a warm house surrounded by people that genuinely tried to help is the least that is due to that animal. How can you trust the care of a child with a man that would allow a dog to starve to death tied to a pole? Such callousness. Such cruelty. That he would have the power to help, but not only would he not help, but he counseled others that WANTED to help the dog to not do so. That is monstrous behavior. There are evil people in this world, and their evil is possible because of the indifference of \"good\" people who will stand by and do nothing while evil is performed before their very eyes. I wouldn't let that man around any vulnerable creature(including children) without supervision, just in case something bad happens and he decides it's \"pointless\" to do anything about that too.\n\nAlso, he was clearly incorrect as well as being morally wrong, since the dog is still alive.", "NTA.

That last bit is a pretty important lesson, especially as a woman, that it's OK to be angry when people do or say crappy things, and that letting it go should happen when they resolve the issue with you, not because you being hurt or angry inconveniences other people.", "NTA. Gently saying to be prepared for the dog not to make it would be one thing, implying you shouldn't have bothered to take it in and left it to die alone is quite another.

Obviously a lot of people believed that my sick pup deserved a life and this beautiful 14 year old girl saw the same for that pup which shows she has a kind heart. Time and money and resources were given to my pup who was lucky enough to pull through and if anyone told me she shouldn\u2019t be saved I wouldn\u2019t talk to them either.

I did not care and could not calm down, even after we got home. Eventually, he went back out and brought me the rabbit, and my mom helped me nurse it. It took a few weeks, but it healed, and we released it. It stayed close by, and we saw its family often for the few years we lived there.\n\nI'm an adult now, but I can't honestly say I'd handle the situation or my emotions differently.
