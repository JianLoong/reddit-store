I did not come on here to again defend my fianc\u00e9 against people I don\u2019t know nor know him. I wanted to know if I was an asshole for telling my management that another co worker just wished death upon my fianc\u00e9. I know for a fact that I didn\u2019t say anything about her, her daughter or her grandson. She was saying things about my fianc\u00e9 that I was highly uncomfortable with and then tried act like we could be friends. I told her your saying this about someone I care about, which she then said \u201c I hope he chokes and dies, THATS HOW MUCH I CARE ABOUT HIM\u201d which was obviously her trying hurt me because I care about him. But her caring for him or not doesn\u2019t matter to me, it became a problem the second she said she hopes he dies. Any sort of positive and or neutral relationship with her after this would be nearly impossible. I made the decision to report her knowing she would most likely get fired because I was uncomfortable and felt it would affect my job. And I shouldn\u2019t have to feel uncomfortable going to work because someone told me my fianc\u00e9 should die. I didn\u2019t come in here to get opinions about the child support case, WHICH IS STILL PENDING AND GOING THROUGH COURT AS I TYPE THIS. \n~\nMy fianc\u00e9 (25 m) and I (24 f) have been together for almost 3 years. I was very aware that he had a child with another woman and it\u2019s not a problem for me. I have tried to form a relationship with the baby\u2019s mother but she was bitter towards my fianc\u00e9. They are going through court proceedings for child support, so there was some tension. \n\nI recently had gotten a job at Amazon as a delivery driver. I had taken some time off for about 3 months due to being sick. When I returned, there had been a lot of new hires. One of the new hires was Amber. I, of course did not know who she was until she said this to me. At Amazon, there is a daily stand up meeting with all of the associates. At this meeting they give updates about our safety scores and delivery rates and such. On this particular day, I arrived early enough to where I had time to interact with some of my other co workers. A conversation started where we were talking about the military. Mind you, my fianc\u00e9 is in the military, so when this topic was brought up, I felt like I could easily talk about it because I experienced first hand what it is like to be with someone in the military. Amber also felt the same way, stating that her ex husband was also in the military.\n\nOnce I began to speak, Amber interrupted me and said \u201cI know your boyfriend, I know Tyler.\u201d I immediately questioned how she thought she knew my fianc\u00e9. To which she then said \u201cyou know Madi?\u201d ( his baby moms name) \u201cI\u2019m the woman who raised her.\u201d I said something back to her which I don\u2019t remember specifically what I said, but whatever what was said she ultimately responded \u201c I hope Tyler chokes and dies, that\u2019s how much I don\u2019t care about him.\u201d Then proceeds to say it was nothing against me. \n\nI was obviously offended and upset by this. She tried to go into damage control and tell me we don\u2019t have to let this affect our workplace and she didn\u2019t want any tension between us. I immediately walked away. And after loading my delivery van I went straight to management and explained to them what she said to me. They assured me that they would talk to her and she would most likely would not be returning to work after that day. \n\nI called my fianc\u00e9 because I was so upset . I began to cry because someone who I did not even know nor ever met just told me that my fianc\u00e9 should die. Someone for whom I care very deeply about. Someone who I love. \n\nMy boss later reached out to me and told me she was terminated. So am I the asshole for getting my fianc\u00e9s baby mom\u2019s mother fired?", "created_utc": 1703100925, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18n34jj/aita_for_getting_my_finances_baby_moms_mother/", "score": 812, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You remember exactly what she said to you, but do not remember what you said to her immediately preceeding this? Nope. I don't buy it.

He buys food and diapers, but that's pretty offensive and demeaning to the mother of the child.\n\nYou're young and seem really immature. \n\nThis isn't your husband, and you haven't even known him for three years. I guarantee you have ruined any chance of a healthy co-parent situation with them, as long as you're around.\n\nYour first inclination was to have her fired, and then call your boyfriend to do damage control on the fire you just started. You are now a danger to his court case.", "NTA.  Wishing death on a coworker's fiance AND SAYING IT OUT LOUD TO HER COWORKER is what got her fired, and rightfully so.", "I really would like a reply and explanation from you about my question about you changing your story about how the conversation actually went since you conveniently change it after being called out. So I\u2019ll copy and post it directly to the post instead of relying to a comment of yours. \n\nThe way you told the story in the original post was implying that the conversation went something like this\u2014\n\nYou\u2019re talking to co workers about the military. Fianc\u00e9s former mother in law over hears and agrees with your experience.\n\nThen ex MIL said I know your boyfriend\n\nYou ask how and she tells you. She\u2019s the mom of fianc\u00e9 ex wife.\n\nThen you reply something to her that you conveniently can\u2019t remember causing her to for some reason say she hopes he dies?\n\nThis is exactly how you told us things happened. She didn\u2019t say anything at all negative about him before you started \u201cdefending\u201d him.\n\nWhatever you said after she said she raised the fianc\u00e9s ex wife had to be SOMETHING that provoked that response from her.\n\nBUT NOW you\u2019re changing the entire scenario and claiming that supposedly whatever you said to her was just you defending your fianc\u00e9 from negative comments. You changed your story after people were asking you what you said and calling you out for conveniently \u201cnot remembering\u201d or even paraphrasing.\n\nThat makes me believe you said something passive aggressive or offensive about her daughter which is what made her comment about your fianc\u00e9. I\u2019m going to also assume you left whatever comment you made out of your story when going to management.\n\nUnless you clear up the actual details of exactly how the interaction went down and exactly what you said to her then I\u2019m going to say YTA, because you\u2019re purposely leaving out important details AND changing the story to make yourself look better.

Let's look at this portion of your post:\n\n>They are going through court proceedings for child support, so there was some tension.\n\nIf your fiance is in the military and isn't paying child support then he is an AH.

If you can\u2019t understand why the grandmother of a child who has been deserted by the father would resent that man and why there is tension towards the deadbeat dad and why that resentment and tension might emerge in bitter and angry words towards someone defending him, then you and Tyler deserve each other. This whole situation is gross and you made it worse by getting her fired over it. I hope your fianc\u00e9 gets taken to the cleaners in court and has to pay a lot of child support. \n\nAnd for your own sake, realize that someone who is a deadbeat to one ex will absolutely be the same with you if your relationship falls apart.", "I kind of doubt this story.

You conveniently forgot what you said to his baby mama\u2018s mother, but can remember word for word what she said to you? Lying by omission. In my experience military divorces are quick, easy, and expedited. Mine took six months.

She\u2019s gonna be singing a different tune when she\u2019s on the other side.", "& it\u2019s free. He pays nothing.", "> Alright im calling this as incel women be greedy posts.\n> \n> \n\nWe call people like OP \"pick me\"s.", "Seriously, I can\u2019t imagine how much more dramatic she\u2019s gonna be when her fianc\u00e9 dumps her for causing drama with his ex\u2019s family in the middle of a custody case.", "I like your random generated name \ud83d\ude09\nFinally someone close to mine lol", "Thank you!", "Which is so stupid because it benefits him to have a court order as well. \n\nMaybe currently via the 'support' he was paying was too much and he can get it reduced or he wasnt paying enough. It works both ways, but it seems like the deadbeats are all out in force trying to paint the baby mama as the bad one.", ">He\u2019s not dodging supporting the child. He\u2019s trying to dodge being bled dry. He provides what she asks for, now she wants more plus everything he\u2019s already providing. For what? So she has money for herself? To buy purses and get her hair done? The baby is provided for, and that is his only responsibility.\n\nSounds like the ex wants more child support and he\u2019s having the court assess what that amount will be.", "You really think everyone that has divorced/split up considers their ex family? Or their partner\u2019s ex family?", "Not really. I had a student with 5 kids and a husband who beat her and them- putting her in jospital more than once. He wanted to pay 30 bucks a month. Took her years. They also turned a blind eye to abuse"]}
