Having that overarching control and not teaching or allowing her children to be able to perform normal tasks keeps them fully dependent, and unable to leave. MIL is angry but OP is giving SIL tools to leave and build her own life, as an adult. OP is NTA, but there is a *lot* to unpack with this situation, and diffusing it is a super difficult and delicate process, like figuring out when to use \"strong\" labels like directly stating something was abuse and when to tip toe around it to prevent scaring her or causing her to become defensive.

I highly recommend it.)", "I figure if we didn\u2019t step in and let her come live with us, she\u2019d be asking us for drug money or end up homeless 10 years from now", "MIL believes public school is a political hoax, so just kept SIL home, and she never really learned anything because of that. \n\nMIL liked the control too, and would tell SIL that she\u2019d mess up showering by herself and then end up covered in bugs (the bugs were already there because MIL is messy, but she\u2019d try to convince SIL she\u2019d wake up covered in bugs and such)\n\nSIL isn\u2019t formally developmentally delayed, but has a lot of issues (as a result of MIL I think) so we are trying to figure out insurance for therapy.", "Once we figure out the insurance, definitely", "Schools are political propaganda \n\nSchools force vaccines which have government spy chips and can give you government diseases.\n\nIf SIL showered by herself, she\u2019d mess up and bugs would come crawl on her.", "MIL thinks it\u2019s partially a wealth thing too though.

He\u2019s very laid back and his hobbies are weed and art. \n\nSIL could choose any beliefs or lack of she wants, as long as she follows our rules listed in the post with school, cleaning up after herself and helping with meals.

We try to do something as a family every week if she does well with everything that week, such as fast food, money to spend on Roblox, or a trip somewhere fun which has been motivating her well.  Her and I are also reading books before bed every night, which she really likes too. \n\nI think she feels kind of stuck too, because she loves her mom, but also loves how things are over here too. \n\nMentally she\u2019s not 18, but I think it\u2019s more of a result of being so coddled, and not a permanent disability.", "wait why Y T A?", "People don't care. \n\n\n\nTrue crime or fiction thriller- most people don't care if the horror really did happen. \n\n\nThis is entertaiment.
