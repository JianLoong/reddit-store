What if something happens to MIL? What fresh hell is this? No one ever noticed the child never went to school? Who washed her if she didn\u2019t start washing herself until a year ago, my god my skin is crawling? That poor girl. NTA I hope she gets therapy along with all the other help your giving her. How was your husband brought up it couldn\u2019t have been that much different I would think? So many questions!", "How did no one step in or call Child Services before your SIL was 18, illiterate and has no life skills?", "You should have called Child Protective Services.", "Please tell me she also has therapy. She's going to have a lot to unpack and they will help give her the tools to do that.", "If you live in the United States, she might be eligible for free therapy.  I am not sure what the criteria are exactly, but it's a federal program. \n\nhttps://www.samhsa.gov/find-treatment", "She would almost certainly qualify for Medicaid. Most states have an online application that is fairly easy. I have a lot of case management experience and I am happy to help.", "government diseases? holy shit, another day I am glad to live in Australia where we still have these BS ideas just on a much calmer scale", "See about finding a young adult friend group too. SIL obviously hasn't had the same amount of immersion like many kids get when in public school to make friends and build her social intelligence.", "I would look into your local technical colleges if you have them where you\u2019re at.  Many have programs for students to complete their GED. The one I work at, the program is completely free. There may be an occasional cost for books and you have to pay to take the test at the end, but at my school at the very least there\u2019s no tuition. It\u2019s all grant funded. And if it\u2019s anything like where I work they get a lot of support. As a student she may be eligible for certain benefits through the school as well. (Therapy being a big one)", "Yeah,  perhaps you should see about getting her labeled as a temporary dependent. Getting a evaluation done will help give a timeline for how long it could take to get her to being independent. Realistically,  it will take a couple years of VERY hard work.  \n\nGive her space to fail and learn,  and doing so with understanding and patience. To be efficient,  she's going to need to fail a lot to learn,  and by giving her the space to do so in a healthy way,  she will flourish.", "She didn't have her own room?\n\nMy God", "It really sounds like the ideal situation, or close to it. No one's making your SIL do anything, and she has goals she wants to attain, and support from you to get them. I think the closer she gets to the goals, and of course when she finally gets them, it'll be easier for her to continue.", "Change can be scary. Even when necessary. I'm so glad she has you.", "No she doesn't think she was protecting her. She purposely controlled her and made sure she was fully dependent on her so that she can have someone to control for the rest of her life. This is one of the worst - if not the worst form of abuse.\n\nETA: You're NTA, not even close.", "> What does MIL expect SIL to do as an adult to provide for herself?\n\nGoing to take a wild guess and say \"get married\", presumably to someone in the same idiotic culture.", "We did. They\u2019re pretty useless in my area, and MIL told SIL that she\u2019d never see her again if she told them stuff", "You should read it to your sister in law or get her an audio book version of it (you said she\u2019s learning to read? This could be above her reading level right now). It can be comforting to hear a similar story to hers and help her understand that while her situation is not normal, she\u2019s not the only person to experience this and recover from it. Also that her experience was 100% child abuse and she\u2019s got a long road to recovery ahead of her but others have traveled it and she\u2019s not alone.", "I want to, but I\u2019m worried about tossing her in. You\u2019re right that SIL hasn\u2019t had that exposure, but that also makes her very gullible. \n\nMaybe we could find her a peer mentor or something? Or sign her up for a hobby class? I\u2019m just worried she might get pressured into something or have something bad happen to her from being clueless. \n\nI hate throwing looks into it too, but SIL is really pretty, and I wouldn\u2019t want a guy taking advantage of her innocence. \n\nIf you have any suggestions though I\u2019d love to hear them. Maybe we watch a young adult show and talk about good and bad socialization? I\u2019m really clueless here but I agree that she does need friends", "That would be my guess, followed by being a baby factory and care provider to the husband and children the rest of her natural life.", "That\u2019s all the info you need to know you\u2019re doing the right thing.", "I second the audio book of it!", "Did he go to school? Learn basic hygiene?", "Yep aslong as she wants to do it you just gotta do the paperwork:)", "You 100% can. My step father adopted me as an adult.", "You absolutely can. My daughter Ms best friend asked her step dad to adopt her when she was 19, it was just finalized.", "Maybe start off by taking her with you shopping (grocery, clothes, etc).\n\nThen, when you are able to get her in therapy, maybe attend group sessions (you, husband, SIL) to discuss how to get her up to speed in the healthiest way for her :)", "You say that as if I understand you.", "He went to school and has good hygiene but only because his dad was much more involved than hers. His mom did pull him out of highschool, and tried to convince everyone he had cancer, but because SIL\u2019s dad isn\u2019t in the picture, MIL can run wild with her craziness.", "Thank you! It\u2019s a big decision but I\u2019ll definitely talk to her about it. Would the age difference be a problem either? We\u2019re about 8 years apart", ">His mom did pull him out of highschool, and tried to convince everyone he had cancer\n\nWhen he didn't, in fact, have cancer? This sounds like the behavior of a mentally ill person. MIL may need more assistance than she's currently getting.", "I can't imagine it would be your all adults :) might be worth speaking to a family lawyer to see about how to do it but I can't see why not"]}
