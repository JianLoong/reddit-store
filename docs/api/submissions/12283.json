And how was this child raised if she couldn't shower on her own until 18? Seems like there was a lot of abuse going on and your MIL is trying to keep a lid on it. Take this girl to a therapist or try talking to her to find out what was going on. This is NOT about beliefs, it's about child abuse.", "Wow!\nYou and your husband rock!\n\nThese \"rules\" are all about increasing sil's ability to survive this world!", " What rhe hell", "NTA \n\nmom is a relic of when only the privileged class got to read or some shit\n\nI\u2019m sure being entirely unaware of the world around you has some profound, spiritual meaning for the willingly ignorant, but to deny anyone access to basic ass life shit like words is fucking barbaric.", "MIL is the asshole.

And helping her get the education she will need to be independent. That\u201ds your MIL talking. Beliefs? It sounds as if she neglected her daughter, to a level that I think constitutes abuse. What was she thinking? How did the SILks educational neglect not come to attention of local school authorities?", "Off the charts NTA. You're doing this young woman a huge favour. You're teaching her life skills that her parents should have. \n\nMIL is pissed because you've taken SIL out of her cult and control.", "NTA", "And while all that happened, your husband, her brother did nothing?", "It seems you're \"forcing your beliefs\" that \"an adult should be a functioning member of society\".
