I agree with people who say that it's unreasonable to expect your neighbors to accommodate themselves to your irregular sleeping hours. If it's that important to you and since you don't want to move due to the rent,  have you considered switching your bedroom and living room around?", "YTA.  Your schedule is a you problem.  It\u2019s unreasonable to expect your neighbours to not use part of their apartment for normal living during the day because of your schedule.  It\u2019s also wild to me that you thought it was reasonable to ask your neighbours to put their kid in the master bedroom for your convenience.", "YTA \n\nThe world doesn\u2019t revolve around you. When the other tenants moved out, that should have been considered and you should\u2019ve moved to that unit. \nIf it\u2019s really that life threatening of an issue, talk to your landlord to break the lease early and move out. It\u2019s your problem having to pay more somewhere else as this is all a you problem. The tenants aren\u2019t doing anything wrong and it\u2019s unbelievably unrealistic to expect others to live their life around your sleep schedule.", "INFO: What kind of flooring is in their bedrooms? If they have a hard floor you could ask them to put down a rug or two.", "I worked the midnight shift and the kids playing outside in the backyards would keep me awake. I moved to the living room and slept on the couch. Your an adult sleep in another room or get noise cancelling headphones. YTA", "Yta. Consider sleeping in your living room.", "YTA if you bang at night.  It's unfortunate for you that you have that schedule but the noise is happening during the day when \"quite time\" is not expected. If that's your schedule choosing a place to live without people living above you is the solution. You got lucky with the past tents but people move out all the time and others move in.", "YTA \n\nShift worker here \n\nI get it- sleeping during the day is hard enough without all the sounds of life. I live next door to a daycare center so if I sleep with the windows open I\u2019ll hear screaming kids. But this doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m trying to find ways to bother them. My neighbor has also seemed to have gotten custody of his kids more often so I can hear them next to me as well.\n\nUnfortunately that\u2019s the downside to living in an apartment building. It\u2019s a shared space and not everyone is going to be silent when you need them to be, especially during the day when most people are awake. These are normal living sounds and unfortunately children stomping is also a normal sound they make. \n\nEither learn to live with it or switch up your living/sleeping arrangements. \n\nWaking their kid up won\u2019t solve anything and it\u2019s more likely to land you in hot water since you\u2019d be doing it intentionally.", "Nope, dude. It's on you to figure out how to get proper rest when you're working odd shifts, not on your neighbours. Sleep in your living room, in your car, in a motel, move, or work on isolating your bed space so the vibrations don't hit as hard. It's on you. YTA", "INFO: can\u2019t you bang on the ceiling while they\u2019re playing? Or is it done while the kid sleeps purely to spite them and be petty\n\nEdit: if it\u2019s done just for the enjoyment you get in \u201crevenge\u201d YTA. Sleep is also very important for kids developing brains. You\u2019re woken up anyway so bang on the ceiling then or go knock on their door if you want.", "YTA. You\u2019re the one with the problem you\u2019re free to move. It\u2019s daytime. The kids are gonna be stomping around all over the house. Maybe next time put a little more thought into your living situation. Like get a top floor or single unit space.", "YTA. They have a right to live their lives.  Their living situation does not revolve around your sleep schedule.  Some people aren\u2019t meant for shared living, and you seem to fall into that category.  Try earplugs, a white noise machine, or sleeping in another room.  Your sleep is your responsibility, not theirs.", "NAH - But can you sleep in a different room when you need daytime sleep? Since the stomping is so reliably above your bedroom could you set up a sleep area elsewhere in your place? You can't expect day-time activities and location of such activities to follow your need for day-time sleep.", "YTA", "You would be asshole if you banged on the ceiling while the kid is sleeping. \n\nYour neighbors are assholes for putting their kid over your room just so they can have a few extra feet in their room. It is their right to distribute the rooms however they want so not really anything you can do, beyond making the request the one time you did. \n\nNot much you can do here. Is there a family member or friend close to work you can spend those days at? Make the best of it until you can leave without it costing an arm and a leg. \n\nFor anyone pointing out for OP to sleep in the living room, I like to point out OP doesn't live alone. What is OP's husband suppose to do? Not use the kitchen?", "They pay rent and don't need you keeping the kid up. If they are quiet during normal quiet hours then you can't expect much else. You think your money is more important than their money?", "YTA. I get it. I work night shift 3x a week as a CNA. I bust my ass and break my back and I have chronic insomnia that makes this lifestyle really difficult. The landscaping company wakes me up, the trash man wakes me up, neighbors have early afternoon BBQ during football season and during summer kids scream and play all day in the area behind my townhouse. \n\nIt sucks that the world isn't made for or accommodating to people like us. Did you actually try white noise and earplugs? Because mine work great, so maybe you just need *better* ones... If they don't work, sleep in another room. It's not fair to ask the entire world to change for us. We are the ones outside the norm, it's why we get a pay differential. Shit sucks. But it's the life we chose when we chose night shift", "YTA try some earplugs or a white noise machine or the regular ideas for dealing with shared living space.", ">ear plugs don\u2019t work because of the super low frequency thuds\n\nGet better earplugs. Some stop sound up to X dB, others up to Y dB. I slept next to a chronic snorer for YEARS, and snoring is hardly high pitched. Ask me how I slept.\n\nBut at the end of the day, you can only expect a finite amount of flex from your neighbors \nAnd landlords. MOST people work a regular schedule, most noise bylaws assume a regular schedule, how much do you want people to tailor their lives to suit you?\n\nIf the noise really bothers you MOVE. I would suggest a newer, purpose-built apartment building. The soundproofing should suit you fine, and the odds are that a one bedroom apartment is going to be below a one bedroom apartment, is going to be below a one bedroom apartment and so on. \n\nYTA.", "YTA - welcome to apartment living, get the eff over it.", "It is an apartment, duh.  Try ear plugs or noise canceling headphones.", "Yta. It be different if they were noisy say from 11 at night to before 7/ 8 in morning but it's normal daytime hours so they can be as loud as daily living allows them.", "YTA you can't fix a problem like this by making .more noise. \n\nSwap your bedroom and living room\n\n\nYou are the one who sleeps at unusual times.", "YTA", "YTA", "Nta but you need to find a solution, maybe fill a complaint to the landlord, otherwise you\u2019ll have to sleep in the living room", "Lol do it and update us NTA", "Play really loud music all day while you're out of the house (not at night) with speakers facing the ceiling. Cops can't do anything during the day and the landlord can't legally enter the premises to shut it off without 24 hours notice. \n\nYou can annoy them to make them consider switching, but nothing at normal sleeping hours.", "As a fellow day sleeper, I get it. It sucks. Unfortunately not much you can do about your neighbors lack of consideration. You can however live your life during your hours and if that includes loud noises at night which wake thier kid, nothing they can say. As long as you aren't violating the lease. I had people complain to the landlord that I was walking around all night, keeping them awake.\nSuggest you look for a new place, talk with the landlord, and don't ever live under someone. NTA", "NTA but wake the parents instead", "NTA bang the shit outta that ceiling", "Yes please keep the parents up..I did this exact thing to an upstairs neighbor and I can guarantee you after I got done with all the noise while they were trying to sleep vacuuming the ceiling, banging a chair in the ceiling, using my broom and mop to bang on the ceiling like (petty I know)..or out blasting their sound system they blasted throughout the day I didn\u2019t hear a peep from them for the few months it took for my lease to end to move.

Someone who has sleep issues (schedule or otherwise) should avoid being below another unit if at all possible.", "Actually nevermind my judgement is the same regardless. YTA. petty. Mean. Ruining a child\u2019s sleep over them being a child. If you feel so inclined you could politely knock on their door and ask them very nicely if there\u2019s any way the stomping can be minimized (they are a kid the answer will be a polite okay but reality is a no). Find a spot in your apartment where the banging isn\u2019t as bad and sleep there. (For example: if the banging is louder over the bedroom go to the living room.). Buy one of those sleep masks that go over your ears and plays music. Find a solution", "Yeah this is going to be your only route. \n\nGet a sound measuring device and a camera to record, if it\u2019s over 80 decibels then it\u2019s considered unreasonable volume in most states. \n\nLike I could agree with the YTA scores if you were working from home and were mad about the noise.

Him playing music when he isnt in when they wont be home either wont help and just makes him the issue.", "In his story he says it doesn\u2019t work.. but I guess this solution is possible.

If another tenant is violating your right to quiet enjoyment, your landlord must take reasonable measures to remedy the situation. Because what's disturbing to one tenant might not be pleasant to another (such as the stomping on the floor or whatever the child is doing) Many state and local laws allow tenants in similar situations to withhold rent or move out without obligation to pay the remaining rent due under the lease.", "Well, if that's the case in their state or country then perhaps that's an avenue OP should explore."]}
