I live next door to a daycare center so if I sleep with the windows open I\u2019ll hear screaming kids. But this doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m trying to find ways to bother them. My neighbor has also seemed to have gotten custody of his kids more often so I can hear them next to me as well.\n\nUnfortunately that\u2019s the downside to living in an apartment building.

Did you actually try white noise and earplugs? Because mine work great, so maybe you just need *better* ones... If they don't work, sleep in another room. It's not fair to ask the entire world to change for us. We are the ones outside the norm, it's why we get a pay differential. Shit sucks.

Some stop sound up to X dB, others up to Y dB. I slept next to a chronic snorer for YEARS, and snoring is hardly high pitched. Ask me how I slept.\n\nBut at the end of the day, you can only expect a finite amount of flex from your neighbors \nAnd landlords. MOST people work a regular schedule, most noise bylaws assume a regular schedule, how much do you want people to tailor their lives to suit you?\n\nIf the noise really bothers you MOVE. I would suggest a newer, purpose-built apartment building.

They get to live their life in their apartment without your input, and you get to do the same. \n\nMost places have anti noise laws 10pm-7am, and it has to be a certain decibel, so I\u2019m sure a child playing in their room wouldn\u2019t fit.

Personally I think reasonable people walk with a light foot instead of stomping everywhere. U know who stomps everywhere are kids who never got told not to stomp around like a minotaur when their family lives in an apartment over other people. The people could easily teach their kid not to stomp everywhere\u2026 if they are old enough to play by themselves unsupervised then theyre old enough to understand a basic concept like that. \n\nIm sure Ill get downvoted for this given the trend of this thread but I would love to know why as a society a good portion of people think that parenting their kids is something beyond them and that they should just let their kids do whatever they feel like even when its a massive inconvenience to other people. Anyone who works retail knows this and has seen people just let their kids fuck up whatever they want and then walk away as if that\u2019s normal behavior. What ever happened to parents monitoring their childrens behavior and being mortified when their lack of oversight inconveniences other adults?\n\nEdit: lol bring on the downvotes salty parents too lazy to deal with their own kids", "I think the kids are probably just walking around and it\u2019s an apartment where you can hear the people around you. Unless it\u2019s a major steel/concrete tower it\u2019s pretty common to hear your neighbors.\n\nI don\u2019t really understand how you can regulate someone\u2019s walk. If they\u2019re jumping off of furniture then ok, but that doesn\u2019t sound like what\u2019s happening. Even if the kids are running/playing, if it\u2019s the middle of the day I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily inappropriate behavior. OP has a special need, which is fine, but it\u2019s up to him and only him to manage that. Which could easily be done by living on an upper floor.", "Name one state and one law.", "If it was that kind of an apartment you would think that the person would have said they were walking around instead of stomping. The word stomping is pretty specific and means slamming your foot into the ground more than is necessary. Although you may think its unregulatable the fact that we can distinguish easily between the two makes it quite clear that we can. \n\nAlso many people have probably not lived with someone who stomps almost all the time. I am related to someone who does this and it is the most irritating trait. I havent lived with them in years and it still irritates me now just remembering hearing all the stomping. Id agree with you that at a certain point people who stomp cant be fixed, but it is certainly a behavior started in childhood that could easily be stopped if people just taught their children to be mindful. Instead most kids aren\u2019t mindful nor have mindful parents and we slowly inch closer to a society inhabited exclusively by selfish assholes. \n\nMindfulness is not some big single thing you learn, nor can it be taught as such. Teaching your kids to be mindful requires teaching them to practice many types of mindfulness in many situations. To me personally, one of those is not stomping around unless youre in an appropriate place (like on hard ground). Stomping isnt something that is only annoying or inconveniencing at night, it can be just as much during the day.

And actually any management company should be having you sign off on a landlord tenant right guide.. every lease I\u2019ve signed I get one.", "Not sure how a kid making what sounds like a normal amount of noise during the day would fall under that. \n\n> Generally, a breach of the covenant requires more than just minor inconveniences and is found where the landlord alters or interferes with some essential aspect of the premise as to substantially interfere with its enjoyment or make it unsuitable for the purposes for which it was leased. Some jurisdictions have required that the breach amount to actual or constructive eviction. For example, where a landlord's construction activities cause dust, debris, and noise to force a tenant to evacuate their leased apartment, an action for breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment can be supported. Still, an alternative action for breach of the implied warranty of habitability may also be asserted by tenants for issues that are significant but not amount to a cause to vacate.", "Good looking out because I wasn\u2019t going to look for it again"]}
