Now your parents on the other end are not family, they are egg donors at best. Treating you as an unwanted child is the worst abuse possible considering that they chose to have you in the first place. I\u2019m glad to hear your grandma has your back !", "NTA - but your parents are. They neglected you almost your entire life and were dismissive about your feelings and your needs. \nYour grandma sounds like a great person. OP, I suggest therapy. Experiencing this kind of rejection from your parents often leaves scars on our souls that sometimes show very late. Usually when we settle and finally have the room to process our traumas. OP I hope you get over this and have a wonderful life even if your parents failed to provide a good start.\n\nEdit: typos", "NTA. Yes, they had a very stressful time with your sister.  HOWEVER, they still handled things very poorly.  Expecting you to be an adult at the age of 5 or 6 because they didn't want to deal with any issues not about your sister is toxic.  \n\nChildren aren't like dolls to be picked up and played with only when a 'parent' wants to.", "NTA. I'm assuming that you want nothing to do with them, so you can simply block them on all avenues and move on with your life. If you want closure, you can also write a letter laying out plainly how they neglected you and how grandma was the one who saved you, then block them right after sending. I'm also fond of the Absent Parent quiz, AKA you quiz them on who your best friend is, who your doctor is, what you want to major in, where you're going for college, etc. to really drive home how they completely failed you.", "NTA. My aunt has two daughters and one of them was severely disable from medical conditions since birth (can\u2019t talk, walk, sit or eat on her own) but the healthy daughter was never neglected. So it\u2019s very much possible to care for a disable child while raising the healthy one at the same time. No excuses for your parents at all.", "This is hard to vote on. You were an asshole here, but totally justified in being one. telling grieving people that both their kids are dead isn't the polite or kind way to convey this. It's the asshole way. It's retaliatory, its cruel, its 100% deserved by them in every way. It's also the way I would use here. We really need a justified asshole tag.\n\nGoing with NTA as you have nothing to feel bad about here. You spoke a painful truth. Your truth. They needed to hear it and you needed to say it.", "NTA", "NTA but don't hold any hard feelings towards your sister, she didn't ask to be disabled... Your parents could have tried a little harder to interact with you more though.  I am sorry you had to go through this and I hope you get to experience a great life from now on.  Good luck.", "NTA. You told the truth\u2014they treated you horrifically. They deserve less than nothing from you.", "NTA even their comments are centered on their own struggles and pain. It sounds like them reaching out to you has nothing to do with you, and everything to do with the changes in their own circumstances. Even with geniune regret and a commitment to doing better in the future, it is hard, sometimes impossible to get over years of neglect. It takes time and a lot of effort on their part. Your parents, unfortunately, seem incapable of even seeing your point of view.", "NTA. It\u2019s just a sad situation all round. Your parents were overwhelmed and clearly not firing on all cylinders. You grew up neglected. It\u2019s a terribly traumatizing thing for a child. \n\nI encourage you to seek counselling. There\u2019s a lot for you to heal from, getting help can make a huge difference. You deserve to have peace and joy. I hope you find it.", "NTA. They were never parents to you. Live your own life. Your Grandma sounds pretty cool.", "NTA. While I can understand that caring for a disabled child effects the home life and relationships with any other children; this is too much. Stress can make people act unusually cruel or mean, but this seems like it was normal behavior for them. It's a normal reaction for you to feel the way you do and even though you didn't state it, it's normal for you to hold resentment against your sister for monopolizing their time and love. I would expect a child to feel that way, but I would also expect parents to recognize that is happening and try to make it more balanced. \n\nIt's easy for me to pass judgement on them because I've never been in their situation, but this was happening for years. The relationship had been declining for practically your whole life. At any point your parents could have taken turns staying with your sister and the other doing even the smallest of acts like taking you out to the park, ice cream, a movie... Anything. Losing a child is an absolutely devastating event and they're looking for support from you, not even understanding the damage they have done. \n\nYou are your own person and you have every right to exclude people who aren't supportive of you from it.", "NTA. It sounds like your sister\u2019s death kicked up some strong feelings that wouldn\u2019t be there if your parents weren\u2019t neglectful. I hope you take the time for some self care. Regardless of how close you were to your sister, you may be feeling a lot of feels right now.", "Absolutely NTA. I\u2019m sorry for your loss of a childhood but your grandma is a beautiful soul. I\u2019m glad you have her.", "NTA\n\nMy daughter was the same as your sister. She was basically a newborn her whole life & had multiple machines that all had their own little noises they made. I was very concerned about my younger 2 not getting enough sleep, not to mention the glow from the machines used to cause them bad dreams. So we had them room together & she had a room to herself. \nI was always very worried about making them feel neglected because she required so much. So we worked very hard to make sure they had plenty of love & attention from us. We didn't want them resenting us or even worse, resenting her. Thankfully we managed to succeed. She's passed away now but our younger 2 still have beautiful memories of all of us & they don't have any resentment. \n\nI'm so sorry your parents handled this so badly. You deserved better. I obviously understand having a medically fragile child on top of work & another kid, I know it's a lot, but that's no excuse. They brought y'all into this world & they had a responsibility to do right by both of you. You're definitely NTA.", "I don't even know if they realize it now. Or they just feel lonely and decided to make do with me. Regardless, it came too late and without any kind of apology too so clearly it would never be to benefit my life in any way. I am so glad I have grandma and she 100% gets all the credit.", "Agreed. They abandoned me in every way they could without it being a legal issue. Even then, some of what they did should have been enough for me to be removed sooner. They were struggling with my sister and I always got that. But I was still little and I needed my parents and they weren't that for me.", "Thank you. Grandma is amazing.", "My grandma is the only reason I'm like I am today. My parents messed me up badly but it would be so much worse without her in my life.", "How was OP an asshole? Her parents left her alone in a hospital when she was vulnerable. Just because one child is sick doesn't mean you can completely ignore your other one and expect them to just take it without any consequences.", "How is OP an asshole? Cutting ties with neglectful parents is not being an asshole", "Op didn't say both kids were dead. \n\nOP said their only kid (singular) was dead.\n\nOP is no longer their kid, and never really was.", "You get to dictate if you'll have any future contact with your mother and father, and after what was done to you, nobody would look down on you for not having anything to do with them. Including your wedding and future children. Your folks can cling to old pictures of your sister and wallow in their own self pity, but it's ALL self inflicted wounds that you are in NO way responsible to help heal.", "If they wanted you back in their lives for *your* benefit, they never would have neglected and abused you. They\u2019re reaching out now because they want you back for *their* benefit. Your grandma was there for you when it counted and still is. You\u2019ll never be TA for telling those two narcissists to F off.", "I'm so sorry for your loss.  She was your sister and her life was miserable, but so was yours.  I'm sorry that your parents weren't there for you \n I'm grateful that you have the love and support of your grandmother.  I pray that you go out and make a found family.  Friends who will love and support you through life.  NTA.  It's your parent's loss.", "100% agree. That said, telling grieving people that both their kids are dead isn't the polite or kind way to convey this. It's the asshole way. It's also the way I would use here. \n\nAgain, we need a justified asshole tag because sometimes you deserve to throw kindness and politeness out the window and rip into people openly for being terrible to you.", "Added my reply to the other question to my post.", "Not being kind does not by default make you an asshole. You reap what you sow. Sometimes it\u2019s cathartic to be brutally honest. And in this circumstance I hope it helped OP moving forward", "Ah yes, calling a victim of child abuse an asshole because they\u2019re not polite to the people who abused them for 18 years.", "Same!", "You seem like a good human and we just have different definitions of AH or JHA.", "Likewise. Best of luck in life. :)", ">They were crying and angry and told me I was so cruel and my sister is   \ndead and I'm trying to punish them when they're grieving the worst loss   \nimaginable.\n\nThey lost you years ago, and they didn't grieve.\n\nNTA.", "2 parents and not 1 of them could stay with you when you had your tonsils removed or when your appendix. That's a bare minimum a parent should do for their child especially when they are married and in the same household. The failed you for years. My condolences for the loss of your sister. Just because 1 child has medical issues, sometimes severe ones, does not mean parents can ignore their other children. NTA. I hope you're getting counseling. Not so there can be a reconciliation but for your own mental wellbeing.", "NTA. This isn't about your sister. Having a disabled child is hard, on every member of the family. There may be occasions where parents have to make decisions, such as missing the other child's dance recital to take the poorly child to a doctor, or 'sorry kiddo we can't afford to get you the expensive gift you wanted, here's this other one instead'. Those parents have it rough and they do their best, and need compassion and empathy. But this was abuse, in every way. Grandma was clearly around, yet they chose to leave OP on their own. Things like dyslexia aren't to be punished, they're to be investigated and then supported.\n\nYour parents aren't crappy because they had a disabled child to care for, they're crappy because they're assholes.", ">Any time I wasn't a perfectly behaved, perfectly independent child I was met with anger from them. \n\nAs the proverb goes, a child who is not embraced by the village will warm themselves in its flames. Whatever follows this, the parents should be happy estrangement is all they got.\n\n>They were crying and angry and told me I was so cruel and my sister is dead and I'm trying to punish them when they're grieving the worst loss imaginable.\n\nI need to repeat that they got off light here. This is that, \"and everyone clapped\" scenario presented to most but once a lifetime, that moment where you can justifiably chew someone out and emotionally destroy them, with witnesses, and still not be considered a monster for it, because ooooh god the critical lack of self-awareness.\n\nSo, they neglect you in every way possible for all of your young life, and only when they're no longer trying to keep their one child alive do they realize, \"shit...we had a...whatchamacall it? *Other kid*, right?\" \"Yea, we should bond with them now, they clearly must need us\" as if that child didn't need them for a full decade and a half before hand. One wonders how they even raised you from infancy with such disregard.\n\nNo, you're NTA. Absolutely not the asshole. Not even if you stood there mocking them. Instead, you let them have their little self-indulgent cry fit, claiming themselves as the biggest victims who ever victimed and acting like they were being unjustly *\"punished\"* while grieving.", "NTA\n\nThey just reached you because your sister died, if it didn't happens they wouldn't even try, you alredy have a family with your grandma. You don't need this type of people in your life, trust me", "Nta. Who leaves a child in the hospital alone?? I could never do that to my kids.", "NTA. Wow. They were understandably stressed dealing with your sister's condition. But that does not justify the neglect you experienced. When a parent spends 18 years neglecting a child they have no business turning around and trying to bring the neglected child back into the fold. You did nothing wrong. Stick to your guns and good luck living your own life.", "Sad. But too little. Too late...", "NTA", "NTA\n\nIt's not an original thought and I encourage everyone to spread it wherever you feel necessary:\n\nYou do not owe peace to people who abused you", "NTA", "NTA virtual hugs, op. Don't let anyone tell you you did something wrong", "NTA. OP, I have a severely disabled sister like yours who can\u2019t do anything for herself & needs a lot more care than me.

I\u2019m sorry for you loss & wish you had better parents", "You were a waste of time to them then.\n\nJust let them know that they're a waste of time to you now.", "NTA. Hearing what you went through as a child was so sad. I think with a very ill child you give parents some slack but what I read about your treatment was heartbreaking, and thank God you had such a wonderful grandma in your life. What you said was honest and they needed to hear it. I don't think you have anything to feel guilty about. Even now they don't seem to realise that you too have lost a sister that it sounds like you never really got to have a relationship with, which is pretty tragic in itself.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve had such a rough start, it must be really hard for you to come to terms with that complexity. I hope you\u2019re ok.", "NTA\n\nI understand that your late sister took up a lot of their time and energy but you didn't ask to be born and treated like that. They abandoned you for years only to come crawling back when they realise they have no one to live for anymore. I truly hope they leave you alone so that you can heal from all the hurt they gave you and live your best life.", "My advice?\n\nSit down and list out all the things that you can remember...all the times where they abandoned you or treated you cruelly or neglectfully.\n\nList it all out one by one.  I know it will be hard.  But it will also be cathartic.\n\nThen...give them the list of all their failures and tell them that when they are mature enough to acknowledge how much they failed you as parents, you have no desire to even communicate with them, much less have them in your life.  \n\nI don't think they have ever thought for a second about how much they neglected you.  And if they have, and they simply don't care...then this list will help you figure out which is true.\n\nBecause if they were oblivious because of how overwhelmed they always were....the list will make them sad and remorseful\n\nIf the list makes them defiant and angry...then you'll know they aren't worth being in your life anymore\n\nBut if they show remorse...perhaps there is a chance that one day, you can at least be in the same room as one another.\n\nNTA", "The bottom line is that you are now an adult and you get to decide who is in your life and who is not. One thing they might be thinking is,,,oh shit we screwed up and now we have no child to fall back on and help us in our old age. If you communicate any more with them then you may want to clearly put them on notice that tell they need to start to planning for themselves because they can\u2019t just ignore you the entirety of your childhood then say oh wait,,,,we didn\u2019t mean it. \n\nIf you wanted to go to counseling with them to try and heal past wounds that\u2019s one thing but you are certainly within your rights to move on with your life and not look back. It\u2019s so sad to read about your childhood and I hope you can find peace and happiness for the rest of your life.

Give her a hug and tell her it's from a Crazy Reddit Lady.", "NTA.  If your own grandma calls CPS for you, then that is a giant red flag that serious neglect and abuse is happening.  However perhaps you could empathize for at least a moment how it feels to lose your own child.  It truly is one of the worst things that can happen to someone.  I know you don't want to mend your relationship with your parents, but a child's death can make people change tremendously, and realize the error in their ways.  Maybe you can even scrounge some money from them idk", "[deleted]", "What some people don't realize is parent aren't professional parents. They are learning to parent... no one is perfect. You are harsh. Why did you not go to your sisters funeral? Heartless.", "The situation is filled with tragedy. From the deal you got from them basically not parenting you to your sister's condition. But I do understand you. They were never parents for you. Why would they want to start now?

You have justification to be angry. My only hope for you is that you try to understand that it wasn\u2019t your parents intention to be cruel or to ignore you, they just felt that you were doing OK and they were, as you yourself note, \u201cstruggling\u201d with your sister. This doesn\u2019t have anything to do with your worth or how much they loved you, they were just two people who sadly had a special needs child that required ALL of their attention and then some. They weren\u2019t ignoring your needs because they were vacationing in the Swiss Alps, they were taking care of your sister. As someone who is close friends with a couple of people who have special needs children, I can tell you that they feel overwhelmed much of the time. I am not trying to justify anything your parents did and as I first noted I would probably feel the same way you do but I think if you try to see things from that perspective you may feel better about the situation. Please, for yourself only, try to find a way to forgive your parents and let go of the hurt you endured growing up. Best wishes.", "ESH. \nHope you all go separate ways and find happiness away from one another. \nFrom the angle presented the parents aren\u2019t the best, OP also don\u2019t seem like a good person either.

You don't have to accept the role that they have given you, and you certainly don't have to feel guilty for protecting yourself and your mental health. In these types of family systems,  there isn't enough love to go around for everyone. Love is given only when their child meets certain conditions.  The scapegoat's or invisible Childs need are only viewed as tantrums for attention that the child doesn't deserve to get. There are a couple of reads here that might help you, if needed.

You mattered too.", "NtAH - what they did to you was 100% wrong.

They caused that. They were the ones to act like they only had one kid, and now that kid has passed. Not ops fault she is a grown woman who chooses to no longer be shit on. That's not asshole behavior. That's a sane person standing up for themselves.", "I didn't want to see them firstly and secondly, it was weird knowing she was gone. I never had the chance to really bond with her but knowing she was gone meant I had to face the fact that while she was my sister, we never really had a relationship.", "I don't see that ever being an option. They were never my family, they were never my parents and that was their choice in the end. Some things are more than just not being able to juggle everything and I had no say in any of it.

She was my sister and it's sad she's gone but because of my childhood, there wasn't much time spent where a bond formed on my part.

There are some great videos on YouTube on childhood emotional neglect. Dr. Kim Sage has a lot of great videos on this topic. It\u2019s tricky because neglect can be harder to manage as it\u2019s an absence of something and the effects can be harder to trace. It\u2019s recoverable, but sadly, as you have done all along, you\u2019ll need to do your parents\u2019 job since they failed miserably.

I'm so glad you have a great grandma who has tried so hard to give you better. Good luck to you both.", "OP, listen. That man and woman suck and have serious problems.

I don\u2019t think your parents are the best, I also can\u2019t see them as completely evil. They fell short, but they tried. You may feel abandoned by them and you\u2019ll know better than I would there and if that\u2019s how you truly feel, then that is shitty. But it seems like they put effort into caring for your sister, so while not perfect they don\u2019t come off the completely terrible people from how I see it. You felt neglected and decided to leave and they didn\u2019t object from the way you tell it, so they\u2019re not earning any parenting points from that either. \n\nthey did lose a child recently, same way you lost a sister and while your bond with your sister may not have been as strong it\u2019s still gotta be tough on everyone involved. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re a full fledged asshole because you have every right to not want to be involved with your parents based on your history, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re fully in the right with your response to them. \n\nI hope the best for you and everyone grieving.", "Nobody reasonable or worth listening to*\n\nThat said, Just talked about this in another thread. When you neglect a kid you're likely to lose them. You can't devote 100% or even 90% to one kid, no matter how high needs, and expect the other to feel anything but resentment.

There's a difference.", "Please check out videos by Dr Kim Sage who specifically deals with treatment of childhood emotional neglect. You can learn to reparent yourself, and though it\u2019s terribly unfair, do the work yourself that your parents should have.

Do you understand the notion of toxic, emotionally abusive parents?? That people are allowed to cut abusive people from their life?? Do you know what victim blaming is?? No, op is not selfish at all. Those people ABANDONED her for years, even when she lived with them. It's because of people like you that victims are guilted into letting the abusers back in their life. \n\n>parents attempted outreach and were met with malice.\n\nI can't even with this.... what a disgusting view.

I could be wrong though.", "Op was a child when she was abandoned by her parents. Over and over again. She just told them the truth, they had lost their only child.
