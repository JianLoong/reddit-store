Scream that fact from the mountain top if you choose, regardless of how it makes your mother and father look.", "NTA.\n\n>They were crying and angry and told me I was so cruel\n\nThey have been cruel to you for the whole of your life. Effectively they abandoned you. They have no right to be involved in anything that you do.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry they weren\u2019t there for you. I\u2019m sorry they neglected you. I\u2019m sorry they placed unfair burdens on you. I\u2019m sorry they neglected your medical needs to focus on your sister\u2019s. I\u2019m sorry they left you on your own. I\u2019m sorry they ruined your relationship with them. I\u2019m sorry they ruined your relationship with your sister.\n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry for your loss.\n\nWishing you a brilliant future and sending a hip hip hooray to your grandma.", "Nta, they did not treat you like their child at any point in your life. They treated you as an inconvenience and now that the child they actually cared for is gone they want to pretend the last 18 years of your life didn\u2019t happen. You don\u2019t owe them anything, they never were parents to you.", "NTA you spoke your truth. It was very harsh considering they just lost another child, but they were not good parents to you. Obviously it was very difficult for them caring for your sister, but that did not mean they should have neglected you. Parents usually get the relationship with their kids that they deserve.", "NTA. They treated you like an inconvenience, instead of their own child.\n\nI'm sorry that your sister passed. Your biological parents will have to live with the consequences of their own actions.", "NTA.\n\nYes a disabled child can take up much time. But the had a second child who would have needed parent back then. They choosed to ignore you. So you have every right to cut them off. Good for you that your grandmother stics to you.", "NTA, go full on no contact so you don\u2019t have to explain it again. I\u2019m sorry you are in that position, it\u2019s not your fault.", "NTA  sorry that you experienced so much trauma. It\u2019s a miracle you are so grounded in understanding your boundaries with them and to understand they are grieving without giving into their request. You deserve to have your wishes respected.", "NTA, sorry this happened to you.", "NTA \nYour grandma sounds like a wonderful woman  no child should be neglected just because they have a sick child. You had a sick sibling  they are  now  how to realise they have to reap what they sowed", "Youre NTA and grandma is a truly good person. Glad you have each other.", "NTA.  Your egg and sperm donors neglected you for your entire life and now they want a relationship?  Nope.  Even if you were punishing them, that's OK, they deserve it.", "NTA.

Now your parents on the other end are not family, they are egg donors at best. Treating you as an unwanted child is the worst abuse possible considering that they chose to have you in the first place. I\u2019m glad to hear your grandma has your back !", "NTA - but your parents are. They neglected you almost your entire life and were dismissive about your feelings and your needs. \nYour grandma sounds like a great person. OP, I suggest therapy. Experiencing this kind of rejection from your parents often leaves scars on our souls that sometimes show very late. Usually when we settle and finally have the room to process our traumas. OP I hope you get over this and have a wonderful life even if your parents failed to provide a good start.\n\nEdit: typos", "NTA. Yes, they had a very stressful time with your sister.  HOWEVER, they still handled things very poorly.  Expecting you to be an adult at the age of 5 or 6 because they didn't want to deal with any issues not about your sister is toxic.  \n\nChildren aren't like dolls to be picked up and played with only when a 'parent' wants to.", "NTA. I'm assuming that you want nothing to do with them, so you can simply block them on all avenues and move on with your life. If you want closure, you can also write a letter laying out plainly how they neglected you and how grandma was the one who saved you, then block them right after sending. I'm also fond of the Absent Parent quiz, AKA you quiz them on who your best friend is, who your doctor is, what you want to major in, where you're going for college, etc. to really drive home how they completely failed you.", "NTA. My aunt has two daughters and one of them was severely disable from medical conditions since birth (can\u2019t talk, walk, sit or eat on her own) but the healthy daughter was never neglected. So it\u2019s very much possible to care for a disable child while raising the healthy one at the same time. No excuses for your parents at all.", "This is hard to vote on. You were an asshole here, but totally justified in being one. telling grieving people that both their kids are dead isn't the polite or kind way to convey this. It's the asshole way. It's retaliatory, its cruel, its 100% deserved by them in every way. It's also the way I would use here. We really need a justified asshole tag.\n\nGoing with NTA as you have nothing to feel bad about here. You spoke a painful truth. Your truth. They needed to hear it and you needed to say it.", "NTA", "NTA but don't hold any hard feelings towards your sister, she didn't ask to be disabled... Your parents could have tried a little harder to interact with you more though.  I am sorry you had to go through this and I hope you get to experience a great life from now on.  Good luck.", "NTA. You told the truth\u2014they treated you horrifically. They deserve less than nothing from you.", "NTA even their comments are centered on their own struggles and pain. It sounds like them reaching out to you has nothing to do with you, and everything to do with the changes in their own circumstances. Even with geniune regret and a commitment to doing better in the future, it is hard, sometimes impossible to get over years of neglect. It takes time and a lot of effort on their part. Your parents, unfortunately, seem incapable of even seeing your point of view.", "NTA. It\u2019s just a sad situation all round. Your parents were overwhelmed and clearly not firing on all cylinders. You grew up neglected. It\u2019s a terribly traumatizing thing for a child. \n\nI encourage you to seek counselling. There\u2019s a lot for you to heal from, getting help can make a huge difference. You deserve to have peace and joy. I hope you find it.", "NTA. They were never parents to you. Live your own life. Your Grandma sounds pretty cool.", "NTA. While I can understand that caring for a disabled child effects the home life and relationships with any other children; this is too much. Stress can make people act unusually cruel or mean, but this seems like it was normal behavior for them. It's a normal reaction for you to feel the way you do and even though you didn't state it, it's normal for you to hold resentment against your sister for monopolizing their time and love. I would expect a child to feel that way, but I would also expect parents to recognize that is happening and try to make it more balanced. \n\nIt's easy for me to pass judgement on them because I've never been in their situation, but this was happening for years. The relationship had been declining for practically your whole life. At any point your parents could have taken turns staying with your sister and the other doing even the smallest of acts like taking you out to the park, ice cream, a movie... Anything. Losing a child is an absolutely devastating event and they're looking for support from you, not even understanding the damage they have done. \n\nYou are your own person and you have every right to exclude people who aren't supportive of you from it.", "NTA. It sounds like your sister\u2019s death kicked up some strong feelings that wouldn\u2019t be there if your parents weren\u2019t neglectful. I hope you take the time for some self care. Regardless of how close you were to your sister, you may be feeling a lot of feels right now.", "Absolutely NTA. I\u2019m sorry for your loss of a childhood but your grandma is a beautiful soul. I\u2019m glad you have her.", "NTA\n\nMy daughter was the same as your sister. She was basically a newborn her whole life & had multiple machines that all had their own little noises they made. I was very concerned about my younger 2 not getting enough sleep, not to mention the glow from the machines used to cause them bad dreams. So we had them room together & she had a room to herself. \nI was always very worried about making them feel neglected because she required so much. So we worked very hard to make sure they had plenty of love & attention from us. We didn't want them resenting us or even worse, resenting her. Thankfully we managed to succeed. She's passed away now but our younger 2 still have beautiful memories of all of us & they don't have any resentment. \n\nI'm so sorry your parents handled this so badly. You deserved better. I obviously understand having a medically fragile child on top of work & another kid, I know it's a lot, but that's no excuse. They brought y'all into this world & they had a responsibility to do right by both of you. You're definitely NTA.", "I don't even know if they realize it now. Or they just feel lonely and decided to make do with me. Regardless, it came too late and without any kind of apology too so clearly it would never be to benefit my life in any way. I am so glad I have grandma and she 100% gets all the credit.", "Agreed. They abandoned me in every way they could without it being a legal issue. Even then, some of what they did should have been enough for me to be removed sooner. They were struggling with my sister and I always got that. But I was still little and I needed my parents and they weren't that for me.", "Thank you. Grandma is amazing.", "My grandma is the only reason I'm like I am today. My parents messed me up badly but it would be so much worse without her in my life.", "How was OP an asshole? Her parents left her alone in a hospital when she was vulnerable. Just because one child is sick doesn't mean you can completely ignore your other one and expect them to just take it without any consequences.", "How is OP an asshole? Cutting ties with neglectful parents is not being an asshole", "Op didn't say both kids were dead. \n\nOP said their only kid (singular) was dead.\n\nOP is no longer their kid, and never really was.", "You get to dictate if you'll have any future contact with your mother and father, and after what was done to you, nobody would look down on you for not having anything to do with them. Including your wedding and future children. Your folks can cling to old pictures of your sister and wallow in their own self pity, but it's ALL self inflicted wounds that you are in NO way responsible to help heal.", "If they wanted you back in their lives for *your* benefit, they never would have neglected and abused you. They\u2019re reaching out now because they want you back for *their* benefit. Your grandma was there for you when it counted and still is. You\u2019ll never be TA for telling those two narcissists to F off.", "I'm so sorry for your loss.  She was your sister and her life was miserable, but so was yours.  I'm sorry that your parents weren't there for you \n I'm grateful that you have the love and support of your grandmother.  I pray that you go out and make a found family.  Friends who will love and support you through life.  NTA.  It's your parent's loss.", "100% agree. That said, telling grieving people that both their kids are dead isn't the polite or kind way to convey this. It's the asshole way. It's also the way I would use here. \n\nAgain, we need a justified asshole tag because sometimes you deserve to throw kindness and politeness out the window and rip into people openly for being terrible to you.", "Added my reply to the other question to my post.", "Not being kind does not by default make you an asshole. You reap what you sow. Sometimes it\u2019s cathartic to be brutally honest. And in this circumstance I hope it helped OP moving forward", "Ah yes, calling a victim of child abuse an asshole because they\u2019re not polite to the people who abused them for 18 years.", "Same!", "You seem like a good human and we just have different definitions of AH or JHA.", "Likewise. Best of luck in life. :)"]}
