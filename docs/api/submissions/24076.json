We always go to one of three places to eat but they both absolutely love when we go to the sushi place.\n\nFast forward to yesterday and I arrive with my girlfriend who decided to join us this time to pick them up and my sister tells me that only Bella will be coming with because Andy is grounded. So we leave with only Bella and when I ask her where she wants to go she says Sushi so that\u2019s what we eat. We had fun and then I go to leave Bella back at home and that\u2019s it.\n\nEverything goes normal until today when my Sister calls me a bit mad because Andy apparently asked Bella where we went and he got jealous that we ate Sushi without him and now my sister wants to know why I would do that the day he couldn\u2019t go and tells me that it was very shitty of me to do so knowing that Andy likes sushi so much.\n\nNow, I feel kinda bad that I took Bella to eat Sushi the day her brother couldn\u2019t join us but also feel like he should\u2019ve behaved if he wanted to come.

Your sister tells your girlfriend that only bella is going because her son is grounded. She's mad at you? What in heck did your sister wanted you to do? You asked bella what she wanted she told you. Sucks to be the boy. But honestly. Your sister kinda is the asshole. You no. You in the clear.", "NTA. Your sister is the one who grounded her kid. Does she need someone to remind her what a punishment is?  Nephew NEEDS to learn the FAFO principle. You behave badly, you miss out on nice things. If you don\u2019t believe me, literally 2 posts below this one is someone asking AITA for not taking their cheating boyfriend to Hawaii because the boyfriend is now whining lol. A child who doesn\u2019t understand consequences grows up to be an adult who doesn\u2019t understand consequences.", "NTA\n\nHe's being punished. He needs to learn consequences somehow\n\nAlso, in terms of your sister, if this was a problem, she should have mentioned something before you went out", "I must be missing something here.  The sister told you that only Bella would be going.  Which one of you is taking crazy pills?  I don\u2019t get it. \n\nClearly NTA", "NTA.  Bella wanted sushi, and apparently you and gf did too.  It wasn't to be malicious -- it was to enjoy yourselves.  Why would you pay for a meal you didn't want as much, bc your nephew is grounded?  That's a punishment for him, not for everyone else.", "NTA What does she think grounding is? You miss out on doing fun things you want to do. He was being punished. He got punished. It's not like A. you guys aren't going to go out again next Saturday or B. if he really wants sushi, she can't buy it herself. What a ridiculous thing to gripe to you about.", "NTA cause he sister said only bella could go and now she\u2019s getting mad at U for not taking andy when he was grounded. very good of u to spend quality time with ur niece and nephew but ur sister might need to know that it\u2019s not something to be taken as granted.", "NTA. Assuming he wasn\u2019t capriciously grounded, this is the lesson he needs to learn. Choices have unforeseen consequences. Good ones and bad ones. \n\nIt\u2019s not your fault that that he was grounded and couldn\u2019t go. He knew you were coming. He made his bed. He needs to lie in it. \n\nIf it was a vital function of his life, it would be an issue, but it\u2019s sushi. \n\nHe\u2019ll live. \n\nYour sister probably doesn\u2019t want to deal with the bickering. \n\nAnd, in the same way that my little sister bought a teen magazine that I wanted and wouldn\u2019t share, his sister probably chose sushi in some small part to be able to gloat when she got home.", "NTA, your sister punished your nephew for something bad he did. That means if he wants sushi or an outing, he can't be a troublemaker.", "NTA but sounds like your sister is", "NTA\n\nHe was grounded. Maybe he gets to go next time. Life isn\u2019t always fair.", "NTA - He's GROUNDED. It means he doesn't get to leave and do things with everyone else. Let him cry over it.", "NTA. It does suck sometimes as a parent, getting consequences when you give them. I always said \"I hate grounding you because it's grounding me too. So don't expect me to care that you missed out this weekend, because I did too.\" \n\nAnd don't you dare \"make up for it\" next time. You just do whatever process you normally do next time. If the kids take turns picking, last weekend doesn't count as a turn used. Just my advice, and my kid grew up great.", "NTA- he was grounded choices have consequences. He\u2019ll get over it eventually. However, I do want to know what your solution is going to be when the next time you take them out and he wants sushi and she doesn\u2019t because she just had it last time what\u2019s going to be the solution there? Again, I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. He was grounded. There\u2019s nothing you could\u2019ve done about it. I just know that this problem is most likely going to arise, and I\u2019m curious as to how you\u2019re going to solve it.", "NTA.  Assuming it was your sister who grounded her child and not a random neighbor, you did nothing wrong in going to the sushi place.", "This is one of the nice things about being an Aunt/Uncle. You are not the parent, you are not required to do things the same way their parent would. You are another adult in their life who, beyond guaranteeing their safety when with you, will show them different expectations, rules, preferences, etc. that you have. If your sister as their parent did not want you to do x thing with the kids then that is something that should have been requested beforehand. \n\nShe's probably over hearing her child be upset about something she didn't forsee, but that's no reason to take her frustration out on you. \n\nNTA", "Your sister is the real absolute entitled asshole here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NTA sorry little buddy, but this is what we call consequences for one\u2019s actions. Sorry, not sorry, Sis. You were the one who said he couldn\u2019t go because he was grounded. Good parenting would have explained consequences often suck.", "NTA, but your niece clearly only wanted sushi to gloat to her brother about missing out, and I can kind of see how your sister would be annoyed by you being too naive to realize it. That\u2019s classic sibling behavior and now she has two fighting children to worry about when one is already apparently acting up.", "NTA. You guys can go for sushi next time, not going is just something you didn\u2019t think about and if your sister knew it would be a problem she should\u2019ve said something beforehand. Also she knew your were going out to eat and she decided to keep him at home, what you guys eat shouldn\u2019t be the issue", "She should have told you to not go to get sushi.\n\nThough I could understand out of respect not going.....but you were already going out with Bella?

This was HER parenting, not yours.", "At the end of the day, Andy was grounded.  Missing out on stuff is the shitty end of the stick when you are grounded.  Surely your sister knows you take the kids to eat out on a Saturday and, as such, why should Bella miss out because of Andy's grounding.  NTA.", "NTA\u2014You did nothing wrong. Those are the consequences of Andy\u2019s punishment. Glad you had a great time with Bella, she\u2019s not obligated to suffer for her brother\u2019s choices. Once his grounding is over, he can have his precious, sushi privileges back. Tell your sister, myself and millions of other Tokyoites ate sushi tonight too. There\u2019s no shortage.", "My sister says that knowing Andy likes sushi so much I should\u2019ve just went somewhere else and take both to eat sushi some other time", "> Also, in terms of your sister, if this was a problem, she should have mentioned something before you went out\n\nDepending on how long Andy has been grounded, the OP\u2019s sister may be as fed up of having a bored, resentful teenager around the house as Andy is of being grounded. If Andy has been complaining about Bella getting to eat his favorite food while he missed out, the OP\u2019s sister could be frustrated but, instead of telling Andy that it\u2019s his own fault he\u2019s grounded, not to mention accepting that grounding can end up being a punishment for the parent as much as for the kid, she is pinning the blame on OP, who did nothing wrong.", "What my sister\u2019s complaining about is I that I shouldn\u2019t have taken Bella to the sushi place the day Andy was grounded and instead take them both to sushi when Andy is no longer grounded. However, all I did was ask what Bella wanted and just took her there.", "You know she did, LOL. This is also a natural consequence of behaving well.", "I\u2019m just gonna do the same thing we always do which is ask them both and make a decision on where to go together", "Nah. I know what happens typical sibling behavior. Bro gets into trouble. So sis decides well I'm gonna pick his favorite food. Then tell bro I got his favorite food. Your sister is kinda dumb for not seeing it. Maybe teach your kid when you are naughty sometimes you have to deal with unforseen consequences", "Is there some limit on the number of times that you can take them to the sushi place?  This makes no sense.", "Does sushi only happen one time in life? Like absurd\u2026there will be another sushi day. She\u2019s make her problem your problem. Not it!", "Well, maybe he will think twice about doing something that gets him grounded in the future if he knows it might mean missing sushi.\n\nGrounding does nothing if it doesn\u2019t keep a kid from doing something they care about.", "Yeah, your sister is being completely ridiculous.", ">What my sister\u2019s complaining about is I that I shouldn\u2019t have taken Bella to the sushi place the day Andy was grounded and instead take them both to sushi when Andy is no longer grounded. \n\nDoes your sister have reason to believe that the sushi place does not allow customers to return once they have eaten there?", "[removed]", "NTA - were YOU the ones who grounded Andy? No - then why is any of this your fault?.\n\n  \nsis learned that her punishments have consequences she doesn\u2019t forsee and Andy learned that sometimes he loses out big time. \n\n  \nwhy would you make the evening deliberately less fun for Bella and you and your girlfriend so as to not make Andy feel even more jealous because he was being punished for something that presumably he actually did. Makes no sense at all.", "NTA", "Your sister should be incredibly grateful that you do this for her and her children every weekend. She is the one that grounded one of the kids and said he couldn\u2019t come. Your sister is the ass hole.", "So.. what was OP to do? Say \u201cno, because your brother was dumb enough to get grounded, you too are going to be punished by not getting to choose were we eat, as we usually do\u201d.
