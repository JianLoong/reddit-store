They've still got a good 10 years in the workforce at that age. If they want your brother to have a free ride, they can get jobs and pay for it. \n\nI've seen some weird posts on here where people palm their kids off onto other people at any given opportunity, but this is next level. Expecting someone else to pay nearly 200k for your kid's schooling is beyond the pale.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nI don't even have to read to know you're from an asian family.\n\nToo many \"parents\" try to guilty trip their kids into sacrificing their life for the family because \"fillial piety\"\n\nI'm not surprised they demand you (female) to pay for their son (male).\n\n\n\nmisogynistic ideas are still extremely popular in many asian society and those people believe daughter are not close family, because they'll get married to their husbands family so their son is their \"only\" child.\n\nThey'll try to brainwash their daughter into financially supporting their son because family comes first.\n\n\n\nShout out to OP for sticking to your ground.\n\n\nI'd stay to hell with their patriarchal views, pay what you own them and let them disown you.\n\nThey're doing you a favor if they really cut you off.\n\n\n\nI say this as an Chinese person myself. Some of the Chinese traditions are extremely disgusting and those who have these kind of views will try to brush it off as tradition and culture. \n\nAfter all Chinese culture and history is based on oppression and obedience.\n\n\nConfucius can eat dick", "Yikes NTA, this is manipulative in so many ways. You got screwed over in that original deal.", "Even if you were a millionaire living in South Dakota, it would not be your responsibility to entirely fund your brother's college education. It's very kind of you to pay anything for it. NTA. \n\nYour parents, btw, are not \"elderly.\" If they didn't want to work to support a kid at their age, they didn't need to have that kid 18-ish years ago.", "NTA - i dont even think your original deal was fair, damn\n\nBut hey - you agreed to half, no more. So do that.", "NTA\n\nA deal is a deal.\n\nIt's not your fault that he wants to go to a more expensive school. If your parents can't pay, he will need to look into scholarships and loans.\n\nYou need to save money for possible layoffs and for retirement.", "NTA this is their child not yours or your husband\u2019s. They need to mind their own financial business and not yours. They can\u2019t go changing the agreements. They are AH for telling your brother you were paying.", "NTA - did you give birth to your brother? Did you lie to him? \n\nThe answer to both of these questions is no. \n\nNot your child, not your responsibility. If your parents were planning to financially abandon their child, they shouldn\u2019t have had a second. It\u2019s not your job to supplement what is surely their poor financial planning. They\u2019re lucky you\u2019re willing to stick to the original agreement. Tell them it\u2019s either the original plan or nothing, it\u2019s a decision not a discussion, and if they aren\u2019t willing to accept that then it\u2019s nothing and no contact until they get their lives together. \n\nHold your ground. If you falter here, you\u2019ll never recover. I\u2019m wishing you the best!", "NTA.\n\nNot at all. Stick to your original agreement. Brother can do the same thing that you did, get scholarships and work. Or get financial aid. And parents can still cover some amount. If that doesn't work, then he goes to a cheaper college. \n\nThey shouldn't have planned for your money. And they also shouldn't have sprung this on you at the last minute.", "NTA\n\nThe fact that they are telling your brother you will pay for the whole thing without discussing it with you is insane to me. They were clearly hoping the guilt will be enough to get you to cover it so they didn\u2019t feel they needed to discuss this with you. \n\nYour parents are definitely TA because they\u2019re just turning you both against each other and expect you to cover the education of a child that isn\u2019t yours. Next time they say \u201cyou\u2019re childless\u201d you should tell them exactly, my brother is not my child and not my responsibility. \n\nMaybe have a conversation with your brother though so he knows your side to though.", "NTA, was this deal in writing? Did you sign anything. If not tell them to shut up or the verbal agreement won't happen at all.", "NTA pay what you can or want to. You're brother is on his own for the rest.", "NTA You're sticking to the agreement (which seems a bit much as it is). If they wanted to make sure your brother's education would be paid for, they should've saved the money.  If they didn't have enough money to pay for both of you, they shouldn't have given all of it to you.  Like you said, you don't have any kids. You brother isn't your son, you're not financially responsible for him.", "Disinherit you from what?  Your parents are forgetting they're broke.  NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYou are not responsible for your parents \"misinforming\" your brother.\nThat is on them, and I respect you for being willing to stick to your end of the deal.\n\nOn the other hand : I'm 56 and was a bit insulted when you call your 50-60 year old parents \"elderly\".\nOkay : it takes me a bit longer to catch my breath afterwards, but you can still find me in a mosh-pit from time to time, and at work the following Monday.", "NTA. Their reasoning for why you should give that money is BS and if it were me, maybe being disowned is a fine option if the alternative is how they\u2019re treating you.\n\nTruthfully, if I were in this situation and had the money sitting around, my decision would be based on my relationship with my sister, not what my parents were coercing me to do. I\u2019d help her out as much as I could (not a full tuition payment!) because I care about her, but the second my parents bring up me being childless as the reason I should, my relationship with /them/ will be burnt.", "50s = elderly?\n\nYTA for that alone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you did acknowledge the verbal agreement wrap that in. Require repayment from brother and/or parents with their house as collateral if it isn't repaid by a specific date.
