The thing is, this wedding is going to be quite extravagant, expensive and child free. While I'm genuinely happy for her, I'm having reservations about attending.\r  \n\r  \nHere's why:\r  \n\r  \nCost: The trip is going to cost me a small fortune. Between the flights, accommodation, and all the activities my friend has planned, it's going to set me back several thousand dollars. I'm not in the best financial situation right now, and this expense would seriously strain my budget.\r  \n\r  \nTime off work: I have limited vacation days at my job, and I had other plans for my time off this year. Going to the wedding means I won't be able to do those things or even take a proper vacation.\r  \n\r  \nChildren: I am a single mother of two beautiful kids (7F and 5M) my husband passed away a few years ago. The wedding/wedding events in Bali are two weeks long and child free. I am unable to find a sitter that is affordable and willing to stay over night for this long. I can't leave my kids at home alone for two weeks and cannot afford/am aloud to bring them with me.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I told my friend that I might not be able to make it due to these reasons, she got really upset and accused me of not being a true friend. She said it's a once-in-a-lifetime event and that I should prioritize her special day.\r  \n\r  \nNow, I'm feeling torn. On one hand, I don't want to let my friend down, but on the other hand, I don't want to put myself in financial jeopardy and can't leave my children alone.\r  \n\r  \nSo, Reddit, AITA for not wanting to attend my friend's extravagant destination wedding? I value our friendship, but I also have to consider my own well-being and responsibilities.

A true friend would understand why you can\u2019t go.", "NTA: it's an invitation, not a summons. Two weeks away isn't a trivial burden.", "NTA.\n\nWhen a bridal couple choose to have a destination wedding, they must accept that some people will not be able to attend for very valid reasons.\n\nYou have at least three excellent reasons why you can't attend: lack of finances, lack of vacation time, and lack of babysitter options. Any one of those things on its own would be a reason not to go. All three at once? - you have made a very sensible decision not to go.\n\n*When I told my friend that I might not be able to make it due to these reasons, she got really upset and accused me of not being a true friend. She said it's a once-in-a-lifetime event and that I should prioritize her special day.*\n\nOP, I want to tell you a personal anecdote.\n\nSomeone very close to me, \"James\", got married a few years ago to \"Jenny\". James invited his closest friend \"David\" and David's wife \"Debbie\" to the wedding.\n\nJames and David had known each other for almost 50 years, since they were both very young children. They were lifelong best friends, and had been best man at each other's first weddings.\n\nNaturally, David desperately wanted to come to James's wedding. But he'd already arranged a trip overseas with Debbie, so couldn't make it, and (for a reason that became obvious later, but James didn't know at the time) David couldn't cancel or postpone the trip.\n\nJames was sad, and puzzled, but he responded with kindness. He didn't throw a tantrum, he didn't try to guilt David, he didn't demand David cancel his trip. He told David he would be sad not to have him and Debbie there at the wedding, but wished him a great trip.\n\nJames and Jenny caught up with David and Debbie before the overseas trip, and again after they got back. It didn't affect their friendship in the slightest.\n\nWhat James didn't know at the time, but David and Debbie did, is that David had terminal cancer. This trip overseas was the last one David would ever be well enough to take. He ended up telling James he was dying, shortly before the end, when he couldn't hide it any more.\n\nJames was naturally devastated, but relieved that he never tried to guilt David into not going on his trip. He behaved impeccably throughout. He was a good, supportive friend. He didn't understand David's reasons at the time, but **he accepted they must be good reasons**.\n\nIt gives James great comfort to know that David was able to have one last overseas trip with Debbie, and she now has that as a lasting memory of David. It also gives James comfort to know that David could not have had a better friend, even when James didn't understand what was going on.\n\nThis is how **real** friends deal with a situation where one person is planning a special event and the other person can't go. James and David handled it in a far more mature manner than your so-called close friend is handling it.\n\nFeel free to read the story above to your friend if she tries to guilt you again. I have changed only the names.", "NTA. If she is really as good a friend as you make it out, she would be totally understanding why your could not attend because of your financial and family situation.", "Nta   Ask her bluntly what she expects you to do with your kids during this time.  \nHer insane wedding wants are not your lifestyle needs.", "NTA\n\nSimply you can't go. You just stated why quite eloquently. Even if you wanted to go, you can't. \n\nA 2 week destination wedding is quite a bit. Vacations with your children at these ages are also \"once in a lifetime\". And I would assume your relationship with your OWN children is more important than with this entitled friend.", "NTA. In all honesty YWBTA if you went.

Her wedding is her \u201conce-in-a-life-time event\u201d, not yours.

Prioritize the bride is never correct.  You don\u2019t destroy your life to make one bride happy.  The sheer gall.  No.  Brides and grooms can plan however they want and invite whomever they want.

The invitee may therefore decline, hence the term invitation.  Destination weddings are great, but the cost and duration will render it impossible to some guests.  Child free are great, but it will render it impossible for some guests.  Long duration will likewise reduce attendance.  Coupling all those together - duh.  Your acquaintance is not a friend.

Your children and financial stability is more important.  Your friend sounds selfish and immature.\n\nA true friend should understand that you are not financially able to attend, you don\u2019t have childcare for two weeks, nor do you have unlimited time off.  Going to her wedding means other things you wanted to do gets out on hold.  When someone has a destination wedding, they shouldn\u2019t expect others to do into debt to attend.

Your friend decided to have a destination wedding (and a pretty expensive one, too!) and she needs to understand that while she can do this if she wants... that the people she invites may not want or be able to go.  If she was a true friend, she would understand, say that she's sorry that you won't be able to go, and offer to get together when she returns from the honeymoon.  Or she could have tried to offer solutions like providing a babysitter for your kids, offering to pay for your hotel accomodations or whatever.  Instead, she just tried to guilt you into attending an expensive destination wedding that you can't really afford, and also made it child-free which further increases the difficulty in you attending.\n\nShe's not being much of a friend, let alone a true friend.  She has no right to accuse you of failing her. NTA", "Well, until the next wedding\u2026", "Exactly", "Love this phrase - so succinct!", "Dont! She will say they can take care of themselves cause this is once in a lifetime event!", "OP didn't complain that the wedding is childfree. She also said money is tight. I suppose you'd also argue that it's OP's fault that her husband died and she doesn't magically have more money.", "Normally I'm not a fan of the /s, but I'm reaaaaaaaaaaaaly hoping that this comment dropped theirs.", "*YTA. I hate to be that guy, but it's really your fault for having kids.* \n\nYou are that guy.", "Yeah, I can't actually think of a wedding that was billed as a \"once-in-a-lifetime event\" where that actually ended up being true.", "I know she didn't complain about the childfree wedding, but it seems one of the main reasons she can't take the kids is that the wedding is childfree. Having a childfree wedding is perfectly understandable to me, if I was OP's friend I wouldn't want a single little brat at my wedding. \n\n\\>  it's OP's fault that her husband died and she doesn't magically have more money\n\nwell obviously it's not her fault that her husband died and she doesn't have money, but it is her fault she chose to have kids, and spend money on them.", "Isn\u2019t Bali one of the most expensive destination weddings? If your from the states you could maybe manage a weekend to Aruba or Mexico maybe Bahamas but that\u2019s like an all day flight??? There\u2019s no way you could try to do any of it. Maybe the friend is mad because a lot of people can\u2019t go.", "Bali is still cheapish for us Aussies and Kiwis", "I wish I could travel the world but if I head to you the spiders get bigger", " But we don't have Bears or Wolves", "Fuck the spiders, I watched a kangaroo tear another kangaroo apart yesterday in a mating fight, brutal af. Then he stood up, grunted and went on eating. I tell u now if he came towards us he was meeting my friendly 243, big violent focker he was, nice looking chap but big and cranky lol.", "I like bears we have one that loves our bird feeder. We have coyotes", "My mind is fucking blown!!!! Kangaroos look cute but they really do fight", "And the biggish spider that lives here is harmless and eats other bugs", "Oh yes. In my old profession I saw a male roo tear a 65 year old womans leg apart when she was gardening because the females were on heat in the area. She managed to drag herself to the house and call emergency services. She lost her leg but survived.", "That is a story I don\u2019t know if anyone would ever believe. Talk about bravery to survive that."]}
