It has \u2018hurt\u2019 my mums feelings in the past, but I\u2019ve explained, I won\u2019t force him to as it\u2019s his choice even if it\u2019s family. (He won\u2019t say goodbye to people he loves because if he does then that means they\u2019re leaving, so in his mind if he doesn\u2019t say bye they\u2019re not going, that\u2019s 5yo logic for you) \nHe doesn\u2019t need to wonder if he should because it\u2019s expected of him.", "NTA, and don't let anyone convince you that you are. You asked her to respect your child's personal space and it's important that even at a young age they should have the right not to want to be touched by strangers.", "NTA. I didn\u2019t like even hugs as a kid. A lot of people got offended, including my Nana. My mum told her that she wanted me to understand it\u2019s my body and no one had say over it. My Nana got it, some people didn\u2019t but she stood firm. It\u2019s a big lesson that\u2019s important for later.", "NTA. when i was working at a preschool i had my class of 2yos out on a walk and a random person walking past stopped, leaned down and tugged on one of my kids\u2019 curly hair and i almost tore their hand off. what is with people treating little kids like dolls/pets??? your friend needs to learn to keep her hands to herself.", "NTA. Nobody should be touching your child without your permission and their consent", "NTA, but lots of us are socialized to approach little kids exactly like that (I know I was), and your friend probably did it unthinkingly, with good, affectionate intentions. The interaction took such an unexpected turn for her that she felt extremely awkward and lashed out. It's a learning process. You were absolutely right to call her out, because it is weird and kids' personal space should be respected, but not touching a kid affectionately can be really counterintuitive depending on where you are from and how you are raised.", "NTA, and that used to bother me when my daughter was small. Even now, we have some neighbors with teen kids who do chores for us sometimes.  I always text mom or dad and never the kids even though I have their cell numbers.  Because it\u2019s inappropriate (IMO) for an adult to communicate directly with someone else\u2019s child in that manner.  Even a teen.

I turned around to pick something up, and a woman was stroking my 7 month old's feet while the baby just looked scared. \nI was so shocked! The entitlement to touch someone's child without their consent. \nIf you know the child and you know they're OK with it, then maybe. But they're not PUPPIES!", "NTA. I hate it when people do that. Like it\u2019s still a person, just like you wouldn\u2019t walk up to a stranger in their 30s, don\u2019t touch the kid just because they can not say no or beat you up wth", "NTA for not wanting random strangers to touch your daughter. Eww.\n\nYTA or NTA for your interaction with your friend, depending on how you said it.\n\nNTA if you laughed and said \"oh wow, she didn't like that, ha ha, it's probably better if you let her get to know you before touching her. She's like that\" then fine, you said it in a friendly manner while getting your point across.\n\nBut if you got all indignant and firmly said in an unfriendly manner \"She is upset because you touched her and you should try not to do that again!\" (as if your friend had done something outrageously inappropriate with her friendly greeting) then YTA.  \n\n\nUpdate: It looks like you have now commented elsewhere that you said it to her in a nice friendly way. If that's the case, then **NTA.** She is for getting so offended then.", "Yes after it i talked about it with my daughter, and told her that in those situations she can just say \"stop!\" And \"red light!\" (Which she uses to say stop), and she got happier, i think because i provided her a solution. But i think it's intimitating for a 2 year old to say \"stop\" to a stranger adult. But I hope she tries it sometime.", "Oh absolutely! Hence why you were just maintaining those boundaries on her behalf. \n\nI meant this more (sarcastically) for your friend, who should know better. She should have taken your feedback and listened rather than becoming defensive about it", "Yes i know what you ment i just started blabbering about something else haha", "And ps thats pretty funny if i sent that video to my (ex?) Friend haha", "\ud83d\ude06", "When I was pregnant someone I worked with rubbed my belly so I did it back to them. They looked shocked and I said \"oh, I thought that's what we were doing to each other\".", "NTA One of biggest peeves when my kids were young was the assumption of strangers, or anyone really, thinking they had a right to touch them. And me when I was pregnant! Ugh, that was the worst part of being preggers. Thankfully, the kids learned they had the right to avoid touch and/or to say 'no.' My youngest boys are non-verbal so they would put up their arm to stop people. Even family.", "Barnvagnar \u00e4r \"pram\". Short for perambulator which is a pretentious way of saying \"walker'.\n\nNta, They're not very lagom!", "I'd go with NTA. I hated being touched as a kid, and as an adult and teacher I think it's important to teach bodily atonomy from the get go. I do hope you worded it in a good way, because if it was very accusatory that would've been counterproductive. Just a simple: \"she doesn't really like to be touched\" would probably do the job.", "You shouldn\u2019t pet puppies without permission either.", "ESH\n\nI will get downvoted I am sure for this, but you could have just said \"she doesn't know you, that's why she's upset\" or something along the lines of how you have taught her how it is wrong for other people to touch her. You are correct for protecting your daughter, there was just a nicer way to say it to your friend. If after saying it nicer, she was still offended, well then that would be completely on her.", "op=NTA\n\nAbsolutely strangers, friends should ask you first then child.", "NTA - imo no one should ever touch kids in any way unless they have a close relationship, and even then there should be consent or at least awareness of how a kid responds and adjusting accordingly. It's not rocket science. That lady would no longer be a friend of mine.", "Yes, I so know what you mean. My son has very beautiful, rich red locks. Even random strangers couldn't resist the urge to touch it when he was little. Now he is 16 and says he can hardly remember it... But back in the day it was kinda disturbing, especially since he was kinda shy. NTA of course.", "Dane here. Stand your ground and tell them you don't get to touch another person regardless of their age!! They SHOULD know better by now!", "i'm glad you did it back to them haha, that should teach them", "i hate conflict so yes even though i was upset that my daughter was upset, I said it nicely. I said something along the lines of \"oh i think she got upset because you touched her... She doesnt even like me to touch her without permission so you should try not to do it again. But I understand that you didnt know so it's okay, but just so you know next time\".", "I've answered another comment where I paraphrased how I said it to my friend. I tried to say it really nicely. I wasnt mad at my friend at all when I said it to her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: I really dont think she got offended because she thought im scolding her. I did try to say it very kindly so I dont think thats very likely. But ive thought about this today a bit and I think she got mad because atleast ive gotten an impression that she thinks she knows everything about kids and parenting, since she judges her friends that have kids and how they parent. She's only 22 and she has no kids herself. So I think I bruised her ego by saying that she did something wrong with a kid. I mean that's just my theory about why she got mad.", "I agree, I think Op told her things in a hostile way.\nShe wasn't a complete stranger after all, she could have had more confidence to say things more kindly.", "I'm myself from Finland and have been living in Danmark for 8 years now. I actually thought that this is just how danes are. This is not normal in Finland to touch other's kids... But good to know another dane doesn't feel like this is normal :D", "Yes, she can say whatever makes her more comfortable. A simple \"no\". Or \"No touchie!\". It is great that you tell your child that she can show and tell her discomfort. So often they get forced to give hugs or kisses because it is expected. But they are little persons and not dolls. \n\nI don't have a child so i don't know if it is a solution, but maybe you can roleplay to let her train to say \"stop\"? In a playful way? You dress up and be a bad touchy-touchy guy and she \"win\" the game when she can say stop when you try to touch her?", "I think that's very polite, that should not give issues imo. Definitely NTA.", "It is/was. But it has to stop!", "She is very confident with me and doesn't hesitate to boss me around. She often says stop to me. I think it just shows she trusts me and also she's 2 so she tries to become a bit more independent and stuff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat sounds a bit funny that I'd dress up as some guy tbh, sorry :D\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: Or actually it could be a good idea. But im afraid she just knows it's me so shes not scared to say stop, and also what if she finds that game to be a bit creepy :D Im not sure", "NTA, standing up for your daughter's autonomy teaches her a really important lesson that her personal space is valued and her own comfort matters more than other people wanting to touch her. That is a really valuable lesson that could be so important for her later in life, you're a good parent.", "NTA. And \"barnevogn\" sounds like a \"bairn wagon\", which is how we Scots might describe a pram.", "NTA.", "I have had numerous adult strangers touch me. I have long pretty hair. It is not curly or an unusual color. Just long thick dark brown hair that a lot of people feel compelled to touch/pet. Eh, what you going to do.", "NTA. Especially with the pandemic and other vira being passed around, people should keep their mits to themselves. BTW. \"barnevogn\" is pram in English, possibly baby carriage in US-american. - Back to the subject: Since your daughter doesn't even like being touched by strangers, you are doing right by protecting her from that.", "Vlq", "aww, thank you <3", "Lol cool it must be from the viking times :D", "This would change my response then. Explaining it the way you are now does make a difference. \n\nNTA", "It\u2019s a big lesson that\u2019s important for later.", "Teacher here: Role playing like this is a good strategy. Yes, she will know it is you and it is pretend, but it helps her to practice saying no in a pretend scary situation."]}
