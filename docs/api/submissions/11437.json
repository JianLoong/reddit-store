Nobody should be touching your child without your permission and their consent", "NTA, but lots of us are socialized to approach little kids exactly like that (I know I was), and your friend probably did it unthinkingly, with good, affectionate intentions. The interaction took such an unexpected turn for her that she felt extremely awkward and lashed out. It's a learning process.

I hated being touched as a kid, and as an adult and teacher I think it's important to teach bodily atonomy from the get go. I do hope you worded it in a good way, because if it was very accusatory that would've been counterproductive.

I did try to say it very kindly so I dont think thats very likely. But ive thought about this today a bit and I think she got mad because atleast ive gotten an impression that she thinks she knows everything about kids and parenting, since she judges her friends that have kids and how they parent. She's only 22 and she has no kids herself. So I think I bruised her ego by saying that she did something wrong with a kid. I mean that's just my theory about why she got mad.", "I agree, I think Op told her things in a hostile way.\nShe wasn't a complete stranger after all, she could have had more confidence to say things more kindly.", "I'm myself from Finland and have been living in Danmark for 8 years now.

It is great that you tell your child that she can show and tell her discomfort. So often they get forced to give hugs or kisses because it is expected. But they are little persons and not dolls. \n\nI don't have a child so i don't know if it is a solution, but maybe you can roleplay to let her train to say \"stop\"? In a playful way?

Definitely NTA.", "It is/was. But it has to stop!", "She is very confident with me and doesn't hesitate to boss me around. She often says stop to me.

Yes, she will know it is you and it is pretend, but it helps her to practice saying no in a pretend scary situation.", "NTA I Don't get why people think they are entitled to touch other people's kids especially if the child doesn't know them.  Honestly I think buggies and prams should have Don't touch without consent warnings", "NTA to the OP, at all.  Teaching your child about her own bodily autonomy and consent is important.\n\nAnd \"barnevogn\" in American English would be a \"stroller.\"", "NTA. People are terrible about touching children and not respecting their bodily autonomy. You did the right thing by telling her to stop.", "NTA. Kids are people too.

Example, you start tickling her. After awhile she has enough and says or indicate she\u2019s had enough. So you stop. That instills she has a right to be respected by anyone. If parents and grandparents must quit then everyone has to quit whatever she wants stopped-hugs, kisses, tickles etc.", "Ok ive thought about this, and thought i could draw on a moustache and put my hair up, and then try to explain to her that my name is \"Adam\" and im going to touch her and she needs to say no. And then i'll give her a piece of chocolate to show she won. Or is that dumb? :D\n\nEdit: and should i try to touch her bum to teach her to protect herself from sexual harrassment or is that just creepy and basically sexual harrasment on itself? \ud83d\ude06 lol i dont know if i should do this", "Im always quite careful with her, because i want her to feel good. Even if i want to give her a kiss. It's more important that shes feeling good, than it is for me to give a kiss. I always ask her if i can hug her or giver her a kiss. Sometimes she says no, and i respect that. Sometimes she says yes and thats great :)", "You are teaching her that her boundaries are completely valid. My kids didn\u2019t care until they were close to teenagers. I only crossed that line with my granddaughter once. I just didn\u2019t think. You on the other hand is thinking very well. You are giving her the tools to not accept disrespect by ANYONE. That\u2019s a valuable tool. You validated her wish to not have strangers touch her. There\u2019s nothing more valuable. While the role playing is very appropriate, you\u2019re already teaching her what that role playing is designed to teach kids.", "Thank you.

Remember you child is learning RIGHT NOW what boundaries are and how to establish them.  What is she going to learn if you allow people to put their hands on her body when she doesn\u2019t want it?

He froze and then went, \"OH! I get it!\"", "It is SO intimidating for kids to speak up to adults, so it\u2019s vital for parents to encourage it. Like you are!! I take records at an orthodontist office and I had a 7 year old with past dental trauma tell me that he was uncomfortable with something I had to do (intraoral photos) and I was SO proud of this little stranger. I told him that I would do my best to go fast and make him comfortable but that we had to get the photos but that I was proud of him and to never stop telling adults if he was uncomfortable. That sometimes in a doctor\u2019s office we have to do certain things but that he was doing the right thing for himself. \nMy daughter (3f) is already better at establishing boundaries than I am and I hope that continues!

It's great to hear you were so encouraging for the 7 year old \u2661\u2661\u2661", "Ok, that's something, but I think keeping it simple and away from treats is best -- a perv is likely to use treats to reward her for touching, so I think praise would be better. \n\nI'd go with: \"Daughter's name, do you remember the other day when Amy patted your head and you didn't want her to?\" \n\n\"You can always say no. So, I'm going to pretend to be Amy, and we're going to practice what to do when someone wants to touch you and you don't want them to.\" \n\n\"Amy's going to reach over (demonstrate all of this slowly as you say all of this) and Pat you on the head.

When I was 11 I was just entering middle school and cared a lot about how I looked.
