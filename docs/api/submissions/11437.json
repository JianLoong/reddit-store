My 3 year old can explain it to her if it's too complicated \n\nhttps://youtu.be/aSFvJbSQdA4\n\nNTA", "NTA, There are boundaries we as adults need to show and keep that will keep our children safe.\n\nI have found that me keeping boundaries stops my child from second guessing himself, eg, I have told him that he does not need to kiss or hug anyone if he doesn\u2019t want to. It has \u2018hurt\u2019 my mums feelings in the past, but I\u2019ve explained, I won\u2019t force him to as it\u2019s his choice even if it\u2019s family. (He won\u2019t say goodbye to people he loves because if he does then that means they\u2019re leaving, so in his mind if he doesn\u2019t say bye they\u2019re not going, that\u2019s 5yo logic for you) \nHe doesn\u2019t need to wonder if he should because it\u2019s expected of him.", "NTA, and don't let anyone convince you that you are. You asked her to respect your child's personal space and it's important that even at a young age they should have the right not to want to be touched by strangers.", "NTA. I didn\u2019t like even hugs as a kid. A lot of people got offended, including my Nana. My mum told her that she wanted me to understand it\u2019s my body and no one had say over it. My Nana got it, some people didn\u2019t but she stood firm. It\u2019s a big lesson that\u2019s important for later.", "NTA. when i was working at a preschool i had my class of 2yos out on a walk and a random person walking past stopped, leaned down and tugged on one of my kids\u2019 curly hair and i almost tore their hand off. what is with people treating little kids like dolls/pets??? your friend needs to learn to keep her hands to herself.", "NTA. Nobody should be touching your child without your permission and their consent", "NTA, but lots of us are socialized to approach little kids exactly like that (I know I was), and your friend probably did it unthinkingly, with good, affectionate intentions. The interaction took such an unexpected turn for her that she felt extremely awkward and lashed out. It's a learning process. You were absolutely right to call her out, because it is weird and kids' personal space should be respected, but not touching a kid affectionately can be really counterintuitive depending on where you are from and how you are raised.", "NTA, and that used to bother me when my daughter was small. Even now, we have some neighbors with teen kids who do chores for us sometimes.  I always text mom or dad and never the kids even though I have their cell numbers.  Because it\u2019s inappropriate (IMO) for an adult to communicate directly with someone else\u2019s child in that manner.  Even a teen.  Such communication could be misunderstood.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

I turned around to pick something up, and a woman was stroking my 7 month old's feet while the baby just looked scared. \nI was so shocked! The entitlement to touch someone's child without their consent. \nIf you know the child and you know they're OK with it, then maybe. But they're not PUPPIES!", "NTA. I hate it when people do that. Like it\u2019s still a person, just like you wouldn\u2019t walk up to a stranger in their 30s, don\u2019t touch the kid just because they can not say no or beat you up wth", "NTA for not wanting random strangers to touch your daughter. Eww.\n\nYTA or NTA for your interaction with your friend, depending on how you said it. \n\nNTA if you laughed and said \"oh wow, she didn't like that, ha ha, it's probably better if you let her get to know you before touching her. She's like that\" then fine, you said it in a friendly manner while getting your point across. \n\nBut if you got all indignant and firmly said in an unfriendly manner \"She is upset because you touched her and you should try not to do that again!\" (as if your friend had done something outrageously inappropriate with her friendly greeting) then YTA.", "Yes after it i talked about it with my daughter, and told her that in those situations she can just say \"stop!\" And \"red light!\" (Which she uses to say stop), and she got happier, i think because i provided her a solution. But i think it's intimitating for a 2 year old to say \"stop\" to a stranger adult. But I hope she tries it sometime.", "Oh absolutely! Hence why you were just maintaining those boundaries on her behalf. \n\nI meant this more (sarcastically) for your friend, who should know better. She should have taken your feedback and listened rather than becoming defensive about it", "Yes i know what you ment i just started blabbering about something else haha", "And ps thats pretty funny if i sent that video to my (ex?)
