(Maybe, kinda.)\n\nThank you again to all who commented and told me I was not, in fact, being a crazy, racist, A. It's more appreciated than I can articulate right now.\n\nI had an off-the-record talk with the big boss last  Monday and learned Alice generally behaves as if she's the boss of the entire team I'm working with (she's not) and believed she should/would also be in charge of this project. She was apparently stunned and subsequently furious when her boss decided to bring in a consultant (me!) to spearhead it. He actually apologized for not apprising me of that before we commenced. In my initial post I mentioned that one of the things Alice said while yelling at me was that I \"shouldn't be here,\" which was sort of out of place but I didn't think anything of it in the moment. Now it makes sense. I'm not going to make any assumptions or judgements as to her performance and expertise. I have no idea if she deserves the title/to be in charge of the project or not. In the few meetings we had, she basically said nothing, which I took as her just being shy/quiet/whatever, but I guess it was because she hated the idea of me being there.\n\nAlso, despite my having a policy not to really drink/socialize at all with current clients/teams outside of office meetings, I ended up having a drink with both Jenn and Dan the other night. I think I just really wanted to get all the way to the bottom of this and put it away for good. They confirmed Alice has generally been very bossy and acts like she's in charge, but nobody understands why as she was the last person hired to the team.\n\nThe reason Jenn cut Alice off when she went to yell at me the first time was because Jenn knew Alice was looking to start drama, and took Alice saying to me, \"Don't pretend you don't know what the itis is,\" as Alice implying I am racist myself and that I was feigning ignorance about what it meant. Evidently Alice has tried a similar brand of shit-stirring before, and it pisses Jenn off as Jenn has worked in what she says were horrifically racist/sexist environments in the past and this job isn't one, so she feels really sensitive to the idea of starting drama where there isn't any. The impression I get is that aside from general work annoyances, everyone really IS happy there, but then again I'm only there once a week so wtf do I know?\n\nI have no new info on Alice.\n\nAnyway, so that's the whole story and I guess this is all over now. Can't thank everyone enough for your thoughts and opinions.", "created_utc": 1682350525, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12xlq23/update_aita_for_not_knowing_a_term_that_someone/", "score": 723, "replies": ["I'm surprised that Alice hasn't already talked herself out of a job.  \n\nI've never heard that term before myself and searched for it and nearly every proper and slang definition its just neutral \"being sleepy after a big meal\" except for 1 place which was extremely racist (basically a variant of the N-word with \"itis\" added to the end).\n\nGood luck in life.", "Number one, you can't be an AH for simply not knowing something: it takes time to learn all of the things that \"everyone\" knows (and since there is always an XKCD, https://m.xkcd.com/1053/)\n\nAnd you aren't the only one with an experience like that: the first time someone used the K-word around me (I'm Jewish), I had no idea what it meant either. Because I don't usually hang out with antisemitic people, it simply wasn't part of the vocabulary of the people around me, so I'd never heard it before.\n\nGlad it is over for you now", "I am still baffled by the itis story. Truly never heard of it.\n\nAnd I am in a country from the southern hemisphere of the globe! \n\nUsually we say \"ah you're brain is refreshing!\"\n\nBecause this is what happens when you yawn :)", "Huh, TIL that \"the itis\" is racist. First time I heard it was in an episode of The Boondocks and I just assumed it was a cultural thing, not rooted in racist assumptions about a class of people. \n\nGlad nothing serious happened to you or your sane coworkers", "I had no idea what \"itis\" could mean.  I still don't get it.  Maybe it's because I'm not from the US, but... it seems like a lot of Americans dont' know what it referred to either. \n\nAnyway.  It looks like Alice is the one with the problem... and it's quite likely she herself is the racist here.  (side note... I lived in Asia for several years,and one of the most eye-opening this I learned was that not all racists are white... that racists come from EVERY country and culture)\n\nGlad to hear that things are otherwise working out for you.", "Yeah, in the context of applying it specifically to African American coworkers, it\u2019s extremely racist and would get you instafired from my workplace. \n\nNow, if you said senioritis to someone graduating high school, that\u2019d be fine because it\u2019s coming from a very different place\u2026 but that\u2019s not what Alice was going for at all.", "Alice just left off the n%$$\\*r before the -itis.  I was baffled as well until I read one of the comments in the original post that laid it out.  Jen knew *exactly* what Alice meant when she said that, based on her own experiences with her, and that's why she reacted the way she did.", "I am an old man from the southern US, and I have never heard this word before either.  So it isn't as if this is a word that has fallen out of usage in the last 50 years or something like that.", "A couple of things in black culture are actually rooted from racism unfortunately. I'm black and from the south so it's common for chitlins (intestines) to be on the thanksgiving table. If you looked up the origins from the dish it's because enslaved people were given scraps for food.", "Also can be learned from the same episode of the boondocks haha", "Holy sheep shit. I'm white, and have heard itis my whole life. Assume it's \"monday-itis\" as in,. I've been off all weekend and Mondays suck. We ALL had it. Never a freaking clue it was based on anything, other than a mutual hate of Mondays...\n\nNow I need some Garfield lasagna", "I've read both posts and am still confused.\n\nAlice made the racist comment and then got mad at OP for **not** calling her out on it?", "Never heard of this word except as a suffix for certain diseases, such as tonsillitis. Presumably a genuine racist would be familiar with racist words while a non racist might not be. Anyway, it\u2019s not being an AH to be unfamiliar with a term that\u2019s offensive when it\u2019s used by someone else, especially about you,", "I heard the term when I lived in the northeast and was shocked. I have not heard it since but I do know it\u2019s racist", "Some people are angry for no apparent reason. There is a reason, but frequently has nothing to do with the people being yelled at. And that person will go through life with a chip on their shoulder, knocking it off their own shoulder, blaming it on you. Don't spend any time on them.\n\nI can SAY that, but I'm the type to just mix into it and fuck myself over.", "Dave Chappelle did a skit about this on his show 20 years ago. The Boondocks followed up. \n\nYou can find both online, I'm not linking them.", "The only time I\u2019ve heard it was in reference to senioritis in high school, when seniors reach the epitome of Fuck it all as a class and give up on school.", "I literally only know that word from the Boondocks as a kid, and thought it just meant getting sleepy after a big meal. Had no idea it had any kind of racist .... well anything.", "My husband uses it a fair amount to describe a condition of over indulgence sleepiness.", "There is always someone trying to look down on someone, as if life is not hard enough.", "Yeah. I think she was trying to shift the blame after realizing people did not like her calling op and others \"itis.\"", "It's a common thing for historical underclass groups across the globe: your ancestors got garbage to eat, so figured out how to perform some wizardry and make it tasty.", "I don't have much to contribute here, but TIL a new term rooted in racism that is being struck from my vernacular.   \n\n\nThank you for this educational moment.", "I married a black woman and have holidays with her  family.  I've been told many times that I have the 'itis', or they do.  They don't think its racist, just a word they use.", "When I read the original post, just now, I was like \"the itis??? Did this happen on a Monday?\" Because the only \"itis\" I've heard of to do with tiredness at work is Mondayitis.", "I\u2019ve never heard of it either. I genuinely thought it was short for \u2018idleitis\u2019 which is a term in northern England said to lazy kids who don\u2019t want to wash-up (or whatever they\u2019ve been asked to do). Basically saying that they\u2019ve got the idle disease.", "Apparently it's in common use in the Caribbean.", "I\u2019ve only ever heard it from older Black people, and they were always referencing a [mixed race] group who were tired, whether after a meal or otherwise. \n\nAs a result of hearing it FROM Black people, and because all the Black people in the mixed groups agreed and laughed pleasantly without any signs of shock, surprise, or disapproval (including some very elegant elder Black ladies who definitely didn\u2019t hold with any kind of racism or other impropriety), I had no idea it was considered racist. \n\nSome of the culture-specific expressions I have learned would obviously be very inappropriate for *me* to say outside of certain extremely limited and specific contexts (like only within the specific group of individuals who taught me the expressions), but \u201cthe itis\u201d absolutely never seemed like one of those.", "The (racist) idea is: black people get lazy and sleepy after a big meal. This condition is called the n-word-itis. \n\nSome people have shortened that down to just itis.", "Well. You might wanna watch the episode again (not just because they're still great)\n\nThey go thru a whole thing explaining how slaves used to only get all the reject parts of an animal to cook. All the guts and entrails that the slave owners wouldn't eat. \n\nThere was a whole history lesson in that episode.", "I'm from the same region. I've only ever heard of it as meaning unmotivated, like after a big meal or a Friday afternoon. Never crossed my mind that there was a racist version. Also, it's crazy to think everyone knows every racial slur ever. I'm almost 40 and was told a year ago that I was using a slur. I didn't know it was but now I don't use it anymore.", "Is this a common expression? I have never seen or heard it before. Is it something common in the  US?", "I was gonna say if you saw it on boondocks, you know the hustory", "I mean, strong possibility I'm not remembering details, as I last saw that show years ago. I remember the name, the beds in the restaurant and a lawsuit, but that's about it.", "Yup, many high class meals nowadays started out as typical peasant fare.", "Im in a big city in Canada (which in a lot of day-to-day ways is equal to living in a US city). Id maybe heard it around a few times. But it wasnt until the Boondocks episode  (2005?) all about this topic came out that I really started hearing it all over. And I could swear Dave Chapelle had a bit or two about it, maybe around the same time?\n\nOddly enough, at the time, in my little group anyways, it wasnt considered racist. We were whites and blacks and chinesse and jews, everyone seemed to be saying it to each other. Not the whole word, just itis. But no one seemed to have any complaints. (and none of us non-blacks wouldve ever said the n-word. So it was definitely considered a separate thing.)\n\nThen basically it just kinda disappeared like any other new slang a group or area picks up. \n\nThen a few years later in the 2010s it came back but was considered racist. Now maybe you hear it from time to time.", "No, you seem to have a lot of it right. All that \u2b06\ufe0f comment is right. \n\nJust always loved Boondocks for how they would include those history lesson too in the show. Kinda sneak em in between all the jokes.", "I\u2019m black and I never heard that word ever!", "There is an episode of The Boondocks that talks about \u201cthe itis.\u201d", "I feel so bad now, my friends and I have been saying \u201citis\u201d for a while now to refer to when we are sleepy after eating too much. We never knew it was racist. Won\u2019t be saying it anymore.", "Glad the rest of the team had your back!\n\nThe only time I\u2019ve heard that term was from a Boondocks episode called \u201cthe itis\u201d where they open a restaurant named \u201cThe Itis\u201d with beds since eating there gives people the \u201citis\u201d (food coma).\n\nDidn\u2019t think it was racist, but I should\u2019ve known better considering the source \ud83d\ude09. Great series BTW.", "I'll be honest, I thought it was another 'ligma' thing or a general condition (inflammation conditions end with -itis).", "Agreed, never ever heard of that term.", "The fact that she used a term she insist is super racist, and then she claims OP is the racist one for not knowing the meaning...", "Same - how could she possibly come to the conclusion that HE\u2019s a racist when 1.) he has no idea what\u2019s she\u2019s talking about, and 2.) SHE is the one who chose to use that terminology\u2026. Make it make sense", "I mean, it was a gag in the boondocks. 10 to 1 odds it's satirizing something racist.", "I have heard of coworkers having \"weekenditis\" in which they always call out sick on the weekends", "Lobsters were prison food in New England back in the day!", "Growing up near Baltimore and going to college w Baltimore kids...I never NEVER heard the itis used as a degoratory term. It's the equivalent of \"food coma\". That's freakin it.", "Alice sounds like a problem starter too. I'm black and I'm gonna be real, I didn't know itis used to have racist meaning. As a senior we all had Senioritis, laziness over our work since we would be leaving, and when you have a big meal like on Thanksgiving or Christmas it's either a food coma or the itis. I've really only heard black people say the itis, and maybe that's why, but I don't think in current context it's bad.", "So, you don't have to, but as an Asian American, I would specifically be waiting for a moment to call her out very publicly for racism, but I am the drama. You're a consultant and your reputation means a lot, which is why I can see you not wanting to start drama, and I understand.", "In high school, we all said we had senioritis and skip class and not do our work. The white kids, Spanish kids, and black kids all used the term. This was the late 90s, early 2000s before we all got hyperactive and started calling everything racist. Glad I don\u2019t have to interact with too many people in the real world now.", "I mostly grew up in the south (metro Atlanta) and I never knew that the \"itis\" had any racist roots! I've had friends joke about having the \"itis\" after eating a big meal, and I've done the same, no one ever told me. I later was told that it came from the cartoon The Boondocks, but I'll definitely be careful about throwing that term out in the future.", "As a white man from the South, I grew up hearing it because I'm from a tiny little racist town, but honestly, I hadn't heard it in so long k had to scratch my head a bit.", "It's the equivalent of \"food coma\" for us hwhite folk. Laughable that someone tried to say it's racist...it's just slang @_@", "I have arthritis in my hands, and when they are bothering me I joke about my \u2018itis acting up. It had no idea it was used for other, more nefarious purposes.", "That's true of most soul food.", "It\u2019s also because they\u2019re damn delicious.\n\nHonestly America\u2019s relationship with offal-based food is just sad. It\u2019s some of the tastiest parts!", "My students would claim test-itis when they would skip a test day.", "Servants would put stipulations in their employment contracts that they could only be fed lobster so many time a week.\n\nAlso ribs and brisket used to be the cheap and unwanted cuts of beef"]}
