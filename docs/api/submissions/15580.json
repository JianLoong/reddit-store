(Maybe, kinda.)\n\nThank you again to all who commented and told me I was not, in fact, being a crazy, racist, A. It's more appreciated than I can articulate right now.\n\nI had an off-the-record talk with the big boss last  Monday and learned Alice generally behaves as if she's the boss of the entire team I'm working with (she's not) and believed she should/would also be in charge of this project. She was apparently stunned and subsequently furious when her boss decided to bring in a consultant (me!) to spearhead it. He actually apologized for not apprising me of that before we commenced. In my initial post I mentioned that one of the things Alice said while yelling at me was that I \"shouldn't be here,\" which was sort of out of place but I didn't think anything of it in the moment. Now it makes sense. I'm not going to make any assumptions or judgements as to her performance and expertise. I have no idea if she deserves the title/to be in charge of the project or not. In the few meetings we had, she basically said nothing, which I took as her just being shy/quiet/whatever, but I guess it was because she hated the idea of me being there.\n\nAlso, despite my having a policy not to really drink/socialize at all with current clients/teams outside of office meetings, I ended up having a drink with both Jenn and Dan the other night. I think I just really wanted to get all the way to the bottom of this and put it away for good. They confirmed Alice has generally been very bossy and acts like she's in charge, but nobody understands why as she was the last person hired to the team.\n\nThe reason Jenn cut Alice off when she went to yell at me the first time was because Jenn knew Alice was looking to start drama, and took Alice saying to me, \"Don't pretend you don't know what the itis is,\" as Alice implying I am racist myself and that I was feigning ignorance about what it meant. Evidently Alice has tried a similar brand of shit-stirring before, and it pisses Jenn off as Jenn has worked in what she says were horrifically racist/sexist environments in the past and this job isn't one, so she feels really sensitive to the idea of starting drama where there isn't any. The impression I get is that aside from general work annoyances, everyone really IS happy there, but then again I'm only there once a week so wtf do I know?\n\nI have no new info on Alice.\n\nAnyway, so that's the whole story and I guess this is all over now. Can't thank everyone enough for your thoughts and opinions.", "created_utc": 1682350525, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12xlq23/update_aita_for_not_knowing_a_term_that_someone/", "score": 80, "replies": ["I'm surprised that Alice hasn't already talked herself out of a job.  \n\nI've never heard that term before myself and searched for it and nearly every proper and slang definition its just neutral \"being sleepy after a big meal\" except for 1 place which was extremely racist (basically a variant of the N-word with \"itis\" added to the end).\n\nGood luck in life.", "Number one, you can't be an AH for simply not knowing something: it takes time to learn all of the things that \"everyone\" knows (and since there is always an XKCD, https://m.xkcd.com/1053/)\n\nAnd you aren't the only one with an experience like that: the first time someone used the K-word around me (I'm Jewish), I had no idea what it meant either. Because I don't usually hang out with antisemitic people, it simply wasn't part of the vocabulary of the people around me, so I'd never heard it before.\n\nGlad it is over for you now", "I am still baffled by the itis story. Truly never heard of it.\n\nAnd I am in a country from the southern hemisphere of the globe! \n\nUsually we say \"ah you're brain is refreshing!\"\n\nBecause this is what happens when you yawn :)", "Huh, TIL that \"the itis\" is racist. First time I heard it was in an episode of The Boondocks and I just assumed it was a cultural thing, not rooted in racist assumptions about a class of people. \n\nGlad nothing serious happened to you or your sane coworkers", "I had no idea what \"itis\" could mean.  I still don't get it.  Maybe it's because I'm not from the US, but... it seems like a lot of Americans dont' know what it referred to either. \n\nAnyway.  It looks like Alice is the one with the problem... and it's quite likely she herself is the racist here.  (side note... I lived in Asia for several years,and one of the most eye-opening this I learned was that not all racists are white... that racists come from EVERY country and culture)\n\nGlad to hear that things are otherwise working out for you.", "Yeah, in the context of applying it specifically to African American coworkers, it\u2019s extremely racist and would get you instafired from my workplace. \n\nNow, if you said senioritis to someone graduating high school, that\u2019d be fine because it\u2019s coming from a very different place\u2026 but that\u2019s not what Alice was going for at all.", "Alice just left off the n%$$\\*r before the -itis.  I was baffled as well until I read one of the comments in the original post that laid it out.  Jen knew *exactly* what Alice meant when she said that, based on her own experiences with her, and that's why she reacted the way she did.", "I am an old man from the southern US, and I have never heard this word before either.  So it isn't as if this is a word that has fallen out of usage in the last 50 years or something like that.", "A couple of things in black culture are actually rooted from racism unfortunately. I'm black and from the south so it's common for chitlins (intestines) to be on the thanksgiving table. If you looked up the origins from the dish it's because enslaved people were given scraps for food.", "Also can be learned from the same episode of the boondocks haha"]}
