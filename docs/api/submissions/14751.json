She's nice and very sweet, but a little immature. We met through work several years ago.\n\nShe has a collection of stuffed toys, some from childhood and some she's bought throughout her life. I don't think there's anything wrong with this, I still have my stuffed toy from when I was a child.\n\nHowever, my friend still plays with them - which again is totally fine if that's what you want to do. The problem is she plays with them when she has friends over, and she'll almost \"force\" you to interact with them. For example, recently we were talking about our mutual friends hen night (batchelorette party), which is happening in Sweden, and discussing which airline to fly over with. She then took one of her toys (a stuffed eagle) and said \"X can just fly us there\" and started miming flying. I laughed at this and took it as a joke because whatever, it's a quirk, but then she put the stuffed animal on my knee and said, \"Tell \\[the stuffed eagle\\] he can take us there.\"\n\nThings like this happen regularly and I mostly just go with it because whatever, she likes it and it's NBD.\n\nAnyway, last night I went round to hers because I was mugged over Easter and it's shook me up and I wanted to talk to her about it. I go over and we order a take away and start talking and I start telling her what happened, and she immediately grabs a stuffed toy (a bear), and goes \"Bear will GET THEM\" I just ignored that, and then she goes \"Do you want bear to get them?\"\n\nI didn't \"snap\", but I said, \"Sorry, can we have a conversation without the stuffed toys please?\"\n\nShe then said, \"What stuffed toys? He's a real bear.\"\n\nAnd I said, \"No it's not, it's a stuffed toy, and I could really use a proper conversation.\"\n\nShe got upset then and just shut down and stopped talking, so I left.\n\nWas I the asshole? I feel like I said it in a not nasty way, and I don't think it's too much to ask for a 10 minute conversation without any toys.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for all your replies. To answer some common questions, the stuffed animals are only ever at her place, she doesn't bring them out with her (she's brought one abroad before to sleep with, but again I've never thought that was a big deal) and I'm pretty sure she knows they're not real. \n\nShe's got a good full-time job and a normal social life.\n\nThe mugging wasn't violent - it was a moped-drive by type, the guy on the back grabbed my bag from my arm as I was rifling through it, but it still shook me up.", "created_utc": 1681453535, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12lmr1z/aita_for_asking_my_friend_to_stop_pretending_her/", "score": 1624, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That is absurd behaviour, and doesn't sound mentally healthy. A bit concerning tbh. Is she always like this  even if there aren't toys around?\n\nI'm sorry you got mugged, OP.

It's more than a bit creepy as well", "NTA.  Though I would suggest rather than trying to say what she should believe or do, sometimes its more effective to keep your statements about yourself and very simple.\n\n\"I don't enjoy that kind of play.  I feel awkward and uncomfortable when it happens around me.  Please don't involve me in it.\"\n\nIt's really her choice to do whatever and futile to try and argue or make sense if it, but it's also important that you don't stay in an environment that makes you uncomfortable!\n\nI think you handled it brilliantly on the fly, and leaving was a good choice.  I am sorry that she couldn't support you in a way that you needed, and hope that you are okay too!", "NTA, this comes from someone lying in a bed surrounded by plush animals. They are not real and there\u2019s no reason to bring them into that kind of conversation. Your friend is either delusional or can\u2019t read the room.", "NAH. I'm not going to call someone who clearly needs actual psychological assessment and a treatment plan an asshole for being ill.", "NTA but I do feel some sort of pity towards her. Does she have some sort of unresolved childhood trauma?", "Nta. 31. And wants you to interact with stuffed animals. Fkn get a grip man", "NTA\n\nI would even go so far as to say that no one's the AH.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with being weird. But you were asking for support in a way that you wanted, and she ignored it. Although not in a way that comes off as malicious. It sounds like she was trying to cheer you up, but in a very misguided way. It's very understandable that you snapped, you underwent a trauma and your tolerance for things was at rock bottom as a result.\n\nThat said, it sounds like you two are generally on good terms. Plus, your friend seems harmless, albeit socially awkward. If I were you I'd reach out an olive branch and apologize to her, it doesn't seem like this is something that's worth burning the friendship over.", "NAH.\n\nThere is no harm in your friend's behaviour. She didn't traumatise you by pretending her stuffed bear is real and would beat up your mugger for you. \n\nShe didn't help you but I'm questioning why you went to her knowing that she would deal with this high-emotion situation in this way? You've seen her deal with a lower stakes situation by using her stuffed animals to distance herself (maybe to prevent herself from becoming overwhelmed), how did you think a high stakes situation would have her drop her stuffed animals and allow you to vent?", "NTA. It seems like she\u2019s being a little with you without your consent. She can find a kink club where people will happily play with her, but she needs to learn not to force people who don\u2019t want to.", "NTA but did you ever stop and think your friend may be neurodivergent? She\u2019s at HER house which is a safe space for her to unmask. \nIf you want anything serious you\u2019ll have to take her out of that space probably. Unfortunately, not sure how long the friendship will last since you don\u2019t seem to want to participate on a regular or at least during times you find important/serious  (which is totally understandable).", "NAH\n\nShe may have childhood trauma or something that makes her consider her stuffed animals real. She probably needs therapy. It might not just be a quirk?  You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "i think your friend needs help but i also think this is attention seeking behavior. She brought 'bear' up when you were talking about something that happened to you. Bringing the stuffed animals takes attention away from whoever is the focus. Even bad or odd attention is attention. NTA", "NTA. I have a teddy bear, and ngl I do talk to him when I\u2019m alone. When I\u2019m alone. Because its a comfort thing and im not fucking crazy.", "NTA and this whole story makes me think of the show \"Servant\".\nIf she suddenly has people around joining in her fantasy then run fast and run far.", "I vote NTA but my Stuffed Elephant T.J thinks you are ATA. I can't repeat what he said but it's safe to say he made it clear you aren't welcome in our house.", "my entire nintendo plush collection agrees nta", "Thank you!! I\u2019m actually a bit older (5 years) than the friend. I have a teddy bear that my grandma gave me when I was 4, before she passed and a teddy that my husband made for me for our first Valentine\u2019s Day. It has one of those voice boxes that says something when you squeeze it\u2019s paw, he made a special message with it. I\u2019ve had it since I was 19, I sleep with it every night. I even put a little spray of my hubbys cologne on it. But I\u2019ve never made my husband talk to it! \n\nI have danced around the living room while singing to my bear, to be fair, we were packing for our honeymoon and a great song came on and I couldn\u2019t resist, could you?! But,again, I didn\u2019t make my husband sing and dance with us. \n\nI had to have surgery and my husband wasn\u2019t allowed to be with me when I was waking up (still odd to me but that\u2019s a different story) so my husband actually called the doctor and asked if I could have my bear with me in recovery. He was amazing for that. The bear with his smell and voice kept me calm. But I didn\u2019t insist that the nurses check his vitals or talk to him like he\u2019s real. \n\nMaybe there\u2019s a missing piece to the story. Not one that OP is purposefully leaving out or anything but maybe there\u2019s a diagnosis we don\u2019t know about. Obviously if there is, well that\u2019s a horse of a different color. If not that, maybe it\u2019s a mental crutch. Either way, the angry/ignoring behavior is something that either needs to be addressed or OP needs to decide whether it\u2019s worth pushing for an answer or just walking away. \n\nNTA OP", "I\u2019d be tempted to call her bluff.\n\n\u201cCan we have this conversation privately, without \u2026 [gestures at stuffed animals] \u2026 everyone else? Maybe the bear can go get us a couple beers while we stay here and chat.\u201d", "Your last paragraph I agree. Was thinking she has something buried from her childhood...some trauma. Agree with another poster the girl could use some therapy to get to the root of it.\n\nOP is NTA", "Happy cake day to you!", "This! And OP calling it a \"harmless quirk\" is problematic imo. This actually sounds like a delusion, and it's a pretty big rule not to feed into delusions. Saying the bear is real and getting upset when being told it isn't? She needs professional help. This is really questionable and concerning behavior.", "My stuffed rabbit, whom my husband dubbed \u201cJudgment Bunny\u201d upon adoption, and I agree that OP is NTA.", "My Cabbage Patch Kid and her friends Alli & Gat\u00f3r also agree.", "My dinosaurs, my cat and my owl agree.", "I hadn't thought of it like that actually, you might be onto something", "Wow! I've never heard of a mental illness like this. Do you think OP should get in contact with this girls parents? Would you suggest she try to get her help before it escalates? This is so sad to me.", "Holy crap! That\u2019s some issue! What was the lead up or the final straw that led to Emma being destroyed with a steak knife? When I read it, I had to go back and reread the jump from the argument to destroying the doll.", "NTA. It's normal to turn to friends for support even if the friends never personally had the same experiences.\n\nFriend here trivialized OP's feelings by acting cutesy during a serious conversation, then doubled down when she was called on it by acting like SHE was the victim.\n\nFriend's behavior would be cute if she were an actual child offering support. She is not. They have an otherwise adult friendship. Are you saying OP is TA for assuming friend could rise and offer adult support? If you can't vent to your friends about a scary situation and your friends treat you like it doesn't affect them at all that you're upset, then your friendship isn't that deep.", "I've noticed they come in batches with the same theme. There was another \"AITA something something stuffed animals\" story here recently.\n\nI've also noticed that I clearly have no life and need to get off Reddit.", "Definitely getting \"We'll take the Spruce Moose!\" Vibes.\nI feel like of all the subs, AITA gets a great deal of fiction slipping by...", "I was just thinking, this may be how she is comfortable communicating when in the safety of her home. Something happened. She just hasn't shared what that is. NTA", "I insisted on getting a big stuffed dragon for myself for Christmas last year. It\u2019s Jellycat brand, so it cost me like $100 bucks.

I think I\u2019m gonna start making him talk to my husband about blanket hogging.", "Omg that's so cute, do you mind if I ask what the first word was? If it's too personal that's ok!", "Me and PJ the stuffed penguin also agree NTA.", "My Grumpy Cat agrees and this makes him grumpy. Though, so does everything else ;)", "Would a normal doctor be able to tell you which to go to?

They typically give you a referral to a place they use with everyone who has mental health problems. It really just depends on what in your area.
