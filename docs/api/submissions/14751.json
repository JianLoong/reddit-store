She's nice and very sweet, but a little immature. We met through work several years ago. \n\nShe has a collection of stuffed toys, some from childhood and some she's bought throughout her life. I don't think there's anything wrong with this, I still have my stuffed toy from when I was a child.\n\nHowever, my friend still plays with them - which again is totally fine if that's what you want to do. The problem is she plays with them when she has friends over, and she'll almost \"force\" you to interact with them. For example, recently we were talking about our mutual friends hen night (batchelorette party), which is happening in Sweden, and discussing which airline to fly over with. She then took one of her toys (a stuffed eagle) and said \"X can just fly us there\" and started miming flying. I laughed at this and took it as a joke because whatever, it's a quirk, but then she put the stuffed animal on my knee and said, \"Tell \\[the stuffed eagle\\] he can take us there.\"\n\nThings like this happen regularly and I mostly just go with it because whatever, she likes it and it's NBD. \n\nAnyway, last night I went round to hers because I was mugged over Easter and it's shook me up and I wanted to talk to her about it. I go over and we order a take away and start talking and I start telling her what happened, and she immediately grabs a stuffed toy (a bear), and goes \"Bear will GET THEM\" I just ignored that, and then she goes \"Do you want bear to get them?\"\n\nI didn't \"snap\", but I said, \"Sorry, can we have a conversation without the stuffed toys please?\"\n\nShe then said, \"What stuffed toys? He's a real bear.\"\n\nAnd I said, \"No it's not, it's a stuffed toy, and I could really use a proper conversation.\"\n\nShe got upset then and just shut down and stopped talking, so I left.\n\nWas I the asshole?

It's a little weird but people can be weird, right?\n\nBut she sounds like she's taking it WAY too far and also expecting other people to join in her fantasy.\n\nThere's also a time and a place for everything -- and playing \"stuffed animal time\" while you need to have a serious conversation is NOT it.   \n\n(it also sounds like she maybe is uncomfortable having serious/adult conversations so she deflects and uses the animals to keep from having to be an adult/be serious)", "At the beginning I thought you were the asshole (my stuffed Panda *most certainly* agreed), but then we got to the 2nd half of your post.

This pushes past a quirk and borders on a break from reality. A quirk would be the eagle thing. The bear interaction is unhinged.", "Are you sure she's actually pretending, as opposed to believing, that they're real?", "NTA. This is really quite regressed behaviour on her part. It\u2019s also unempathetic. She has issues, she needs to see a therapist. This is not normal adult social reciprocity.", "Going with NTA.\n\nOwning toys and playing with them does not make you an AH.\n\nBut when another adult comes to you with an adult matter and you grab a toy to play around with instead of having a serious talk then you kinda have a problem.", "I thought this was going to be a YTA, but no. Definitely NTA. You came to a friend to discuss a very serious topic, when she brought out the toys you  kindly asked her to stop. There is nothing wrong with having toys and playing with them. But making the toys talk and involving friends to interact and talk back is very unusual behaviour. I wonder if she has some trauma or mental disorder that's causing it. Either way, you weren't an AH in how you dealt with it.", "You are definitely NTA at all for wanting to have an actual conversation with your 30 year old friend. Making toys talk as a joke is one thing, but to actually get upset and shut down when a friend who's been the victim of a violent crime doesn't want to join in playing like a child?! That is absurd behaviour, and doesn't sound mentally healthy. A bit concerning tbh. Is she always like this  even if there aren't toys around?\n\nI'm sorry you got mugged, OP. When you've processed your trauma a bit more, would you feel comfortable texting her and explaining why her behaviour was inappropriat, or do you think she wouldn't listen?", "NTA but I think your friend may need therapy? Idk if she\u2019s trying to process things through the animals but it seems she is at least using them as buffer between her and the real world.

Something isn't right with her.", "NTA. I have an ex step sister who was developmentally slow and immature like that.

A lot of people would not be so understanding.  I think you handled this very well. \n\nYou have every right to not want to engage in her imaginary world.  She should not force you to interact - or get mad at you when you respectfully decline.  Let alone that this happened when you clearly needed support and an adult conversation. \n\nI have to admit, I find this very odd. Having stuffed animals around, totally fine. Including them in every conversation with others, making others participate then insisting that they\u2019re real?  Seems a bit off.  It sounds like she might have some unresolved issues that she needs to figure out how to manage.  I\u2019m not sure how you would approach this. But I think thus far, you\u2019ve been incredibly kind in your approach.", "WOW. This is WAAAYYY above my pay grade. NTA. You have been tolerant and supportive your whole friendship, even when you found it odd. The ONE time you want to talk about a terrible experience that you may even have TRAUMA from, and she wants to play pretend? Downplay your experience by making it a game? She should've read the room and thought \"Ok, this isn't the time. This is a serious discussion. I'll put the toys away.\" She didn't. It upset you. Obviously. There's no way you're the AH.", "NTA! You set the boundary, stating that you couldn't be emotionally available to play pretend during your time of distress. She couldn't respect that boundary, even for a short amount of time just to listen to you. \n\nYou're a good friend and sweet person for engaging with the toys in the first place! It's really her reaction to the boundary that makes her the asshole tbh.", "If she\u2019s kept this up throughout your friendship and has shown no signs of stopping, are you sure she\u2019s still pretending that they\u2019re real?", "The waddle of stuffed penguins in my living room have declared you NTA.", "NTA. Sounds like she has some issues.", "  NTA, you expressed yourself more diplomatically than most adults would be capable of. Are you okay? I hope you\u2019re not injured and have a more supportive person to look after you! NTA", "NTA I've only seen this twice before. Once with a man, but once with a woman. But it was where they used puppets to talk for them. They made the puppets make comments, like oh that is really sad isnt it. What should we do about that? I think it is some sort of coping mechanism for social anxiety.", "YTA\n\nI really don't get this sub sometimes. Sure, the friend is a bit weird, but whatever. It's her house, her space, her toys, and it's harmless. \n\nNow the OP barges in and expects instant emotional support from someone who is completely unrelated to what happened to her. Yet the friend offers the support - in her own quirky way, but offers it nonetheless. \n\nThen the OP shits all over it because that's not the kind of support she wants. I'm sorry for the friend. And a bit for the bear too.", "NAH, it sounds like perhaps her stuffed animals are a way for her to cope with *something*. I think therapy is much needed here, and i\u2019m sorry you got mugged.", "NAH. i\u2019m sorry you got mugged that sounds really scary, and you deserve support. i understand how this was probably more than a little frustrating and, especially since you didn\u2019t yell or anything, your response was justified. \n\nhowever, it sounds like she may have a developmental disability or something else that is affecting her ability to gauge what is real/appropriate. \n\nif you really like her and want to continue the friendship maybe have a conversation with her once you\u2019ve calmed down. something along the lines of \u201ci\u2019m sorry i upset you the other day, i just really needed support from you and not your stuffed friends in that moment. can we have a conversation about your boundaries in that area?\u201d", "Nta\n\nI\u2019m sorry to hear that you were mugged, that\u2019s awful and you required support in that moment.

That\u2019s insane behaviour", "Imma go against the flow and say NAH leaning towards soft Y T A. You know how your friend is, it\u2019s nothing new.

It\u2019s entirely understandable that this is one time when you just aren\u2019t up for humouring childish behaviour. There is a time and a place and this isn\u2019t it. \n\nIf she really can\u2019t or won\u2019t read the room and know when to put the toys down, she has a serious problem with human interaction.

She is unhinged.", "ESH yes, it\u2019s clearly bizarre behavior, but apparently everyone has been accommodating it for a long time. She\u2019s not going to know how to have an adult conversation.
