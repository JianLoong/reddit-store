They\u2019ve never mentioned to me or my husband, or to the kids, anything about having a problem that I adopted instead of having biological children. \n\nMy brother and his wife have a 3 month old son, who was conceived with a sperm donor. I know this because my brother\u2019s wife talked about it with me, but my parents were not aware. They treated my nephew the same as they treated my kids when they were babies, so I\u2019ve never been concerned that my kids would be seen as lesser because they\u2019re adopted while my nephew was supposedly their biological grandchild.\n\nWhich is why I was so surprised and confused that my parents have been talking about how excited they are to have their first Christmas with their biological grandchild, and that they did a big expensive holiday photoshoot with my brother, his wife, and his son, something they\u2019ve never done with my kids (they were the ones who suggested it to my brother, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s just because he asked and I didn\u2019t).\n\nThe weirdest part was that they casually mentioned some of the things they bought for my nephew for Christmas, as far as I can tell they\u2019re spending more on him than they are for my three kids combined, and it\u2019s far more than what they spent even when my oldest was a baby. In fact, when my kids were little they used to say there was no point buying expensive things for babies for Christmases or birthdays because they wouldn\u2019t remember it, and they\u2019d rather spend the money when they\u2019re a little older.\n\nSo my nephew is suddenly being favored over my kids, at the same time my parents are starting to emphasize the fact that, as far as they know, my nephew is their biological grandchild. I pointed this out to them and said it bothers me, they denied treating them differently, they said I was being weird about money (I truly don\u2019t care about the money, I care about the difference in treatment and that my kids might notice how little they\u2019re getting from my parents compared to their cousin).\n\nAnd now for the part I\u2019m starting to feel awful about: I told them the truth about my nephew. My parents are furious at my brother for not telling them and thanked me for telling the truth. They keep saying he tricked them and gave them false hope about having a biological grandchild, which I guess answers the question on whether biology actually mattered to them. My husband says I did the right thing because it removed all the lies and secrets, and if they didn\u2019t care it wouldn\u2019t matter but if they did care they deserved to know. My brother says it wasn\u2019t my secret to tell and I jeopardized his son\u2019s relationship with our parents.", "created_utc": 1671858127, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zu2957/aita_for_telling_my_parents_they_still_dont_have/", "score": 2316, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her other option is to attend the holiday and let her kids see the blatant favoritism and be hurt by it. As a parent her moral obligation is to her children above her brother. She chose to reveal the truth about her nephew to protect her kids from emotional distress. That is not pettiness. Her brother was the one gaining financially from his lie at the expense of his niblings. Telling the truth doesn\u2019t hurt his own child it just put back on equal footing with his cousins.

OP\u2019s SIL told OP. He may have had any number of reasons he didn\u2019t want his parents knowing that have nothing to do with money, after all the likely reason this happened is infertility which some men really struggle with everyone knowing about them. The thing about a choice like this (to use donor sperm) is that it normally comes about for private reasons that brother may not be comfortable even getting close to disclosing to parents. This can include things like major health concerns and usually when someone does something like use donor sperm, the next question from people learning that is why. Brother may not be ready to discuss the why if why includes things like genetic counseling that revealed a problem, cancer he didn\u2019t previously disclose, sexual trauma that impairs sexual functioning, mental health concerns requiring medication that impairs ability to conceive, etc. There is no intended con here and nothing to say he \u201cobviously had no problem with people knowing\u201d alongside several indicators that he didn\u2019t want people knowing. \n\nOP even says they were treating OPs brother\u2019s kid the same as a baby as they did OPs kids until this Christmas and that the biological comments just started, so OPs brother may have just been processing this too and not aware of the full extent of the unequal treatment especially if he wasn\u2019t fully tracking what presents OPs kids got in previous years (who would as the uncle who did not have children at the point OPs kids were babies). The decision to use a sperm donor is personal and the decision not to tell could have happened for a number of reasons that had nothing to do with wanting to \u201ctrick\u201d the grandparents. There is nothing to say brother knew that his parents preferred biological grandchildren even though everyone is assuming that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t tell. OP didn\u2019t even know that until now and has, up until now, thought their children were readily accepted and treated no differently than the nephew. OPs brother may have even decided his parents didn\u2019t need to know precisely because he thought his children would be welcomed regardless based on the fact that until recently it seemed as though the parents have been fully accepting of adopted grandchildren. OPs brother, doing his first Christmas with a 3 month old may not be tracking that OPs kids didn\u2019t get a special photo shoot and those \u201cfirst Christmas with a biological child\u201d comments may or may not have been made in brother\u2019s hearing. He\u2019s likely not aware of all the things they bought the kid in the same way OP is since those are presents for his kids that may not have been received yet. So the idea that he is \u201caccepting presents\u201d based on a false narrative is extremely unfounded. OPs adopted children got presents, his kid is getting presents. It\u2019s his kid, there is nothing to say he is tracking that they are somehow more expensive presents because his parents are assuming a biological grandchild or that this was his motive in not telling them. If he\u2019s got a 3 month old and is being a good parent, his focus is likely elsewhere. If he was a normal adult without children when OPs kid\u2019s were younger he probably wasn\u2019t adding up the costs of their gifts. It sounds like OPs parents have been expressing more excitement to OP about Christmas. It\u2019s not clear if brother has been hearing those same expressions of excitement or taking them in in whatever sleep deprived state he is likely in while preparing for his first Christmas with a 3 month old and his first Christmas as a parent. \n\nOP never indicates they talked to their brother about the fact that their kids were being treated differently because their parents mistakenly believed one child was biological or that OPs brother even knew it was the case. If OP had approached their brother, asked him to advocate for the children, asked him to disclose using a sperm donor to the parents, asked him why he wasn\u2019t telling his parents if he refused to better understand the situation, etc. OP would not be the asshole. Who knows? OPs brother may have stepped up and decided to disclose in an appropriate way that would have avoided a lot of family conflict if OP had acted like a mature and responsible adult and talked to him first. Instead OP acted like a whiny child \u201ctelling\u201d on a sibling to try to get them into trouble. Note that the parents are furious at brother for not telling and that brother is furious because it wasn\u2019t OPs secret to tell. This all could have been resolved in a much cleaner way if OP had actually talked to brother about what was happening with the children and urged brother to talk to the parent\u2019s first. Deciding to disclose brother\u2019s private medical information that OP was maybe not even supposed to know with no discussion absolutely makes OP the asshole.\n\nOP, if you\u2019re reading this, did you ever even talk to your brother about your concerns about your parents and why he hasn\u2019t told them? \n\nOP, you\u2019re the asshole for how you handled it. You owe your brother a big apology for springing it on your parents and him without warning and for not at least talking to him about his reasons for not telling your parents and your reasons for wanting them to know first. Your parents aren\u2019t great people either (that\u2019s an understatement, they are assholes), but the second you started to suspect biology mattered to them was the second you should have gone to your brother and his wife and had a conversation about how to best handle things with your parents to try to protect all involved grandchildren. The way you handled this was at best clumsy and at worst downright cruel since it\u2019s pretty clear your motive was more along the lines of \u201cif they are rejecting my children I want to make sure they reject his child too\u201d rather than \u201chow can my brother and I, who have both chosen alternative ways of parenting, work to ensure that all of our children feel included and accepted in the family now that we know biology matters to our parents.\u201d Telling him he needed to tell them out of fairness to your children would have been an acceptable recourse here. Deciding to tell them yourself with no warning to him was not.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about what they were told but also how. You can\u2019t conflate the two here. Wanting them to know they were treating one child differently because they mistakenly assumed that child was biological is not what makes you the asshole. If you\u2019d gone to your brother and said \u201cI\u2019m concerned about my kids and their relationship with our parents and their young nephew, they are assuming your child is biological and treating him differently. Do you plan to tell them nephew was conceived using donor sperm?\u201d this could have gone differently for everyone involved. Throwing it in their faces that your brother is keeping things from them (and, again, there is nothing to say he explicitly lied) to prove a point with no concern over what that would mean for your brother or his child is where you stepped into asshole territory. Everyone is upset because brother didn\u2019t tell them/ they feel deceived. This likely would have gone much better if you\u2019d talked to your brother and given him the opportunity to chose to disclose rather than let everyone here feel betrayed. The whole idea your husband has of the truth needing to come out is ignoring family dynamics and questions about whose truth it is or why the secret is there in the first place. It\u2019s not just about there being \u201csecrets\u201d it\u2019s about how secrets get revealed and whose right it is to disclose private and personal matters that might be private for reasons you aren\u2019t privy to. You had a right to be appalled at your parents and hurt by their clear preferences. You had no right to disclose what you did at the juncture you did and in the way you did.\n\nEDIT: your correction does not help, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you consider the private information his, his wife\u2019s, or even the baby\u2019s. The point is that it wasn\u2019t OPs to share.", "It was a joint reproductive decision, so saying it wasn\u2019t private to the brother is absurd.

His niblings had a high likelihood of being hurt by his lie, while his kid, at worst would just be treated the same as the other kids (which is only a bad way to be treated in comparison to their previous favoritism). Lying to receive a benefit for your child is not as forgivable as telling the truth to protect your children from emotional harm. I suppose everyone sucks, but the given only crappy choices, OP chose to protect her children. In the long run this may actually have protected her nephew to. Her parents will change the way they treat him, but if no other biological grandchildren come into the family, it\u2019s better that the grandparents find out now and change their behavior towards him while he is too young to remember as opposed to them finding out later and then he is aware of how their behavior changes toward him.

Given the attitude of the grandparents, I don't blame the son for wanting to keep those cards close to the chest.", "The father of the child is directly involved in conception, if you don't understand how that is different than grand parents I'm sorry but your biology teacher failed you and you should ask your mom.", "Hardly the same as keeping medical information private.", "There is no obligation to share private medical information. The idea that her brother had a duty to inform anyone of the circumstances of conception is laughable.", "I agree that the grandparents are the worst.", "I don't really see why it's a big deal that he didn't include his sister's family in the photo of his owm family. Would it be a nice idea to invite his OP's family? Yes, it would be a considerate gesture. But it also isn't abnormal to take photos with your immediate family and not include the extended family. As far as we know, OP never clued the brother into the fact that she was feeling left out.\n\nAlso, sharing someone's fertility struggles is most definitely an asshole move, regardleas of whether it's on social media or if it's in a conversation behind their back. If she wanted to address the inequality, the first step would be talking to the brother. I can understand her motivation but she most definitely behaved like an asshole.", "Having a family photo dome with just your immediate family and grandparents after you have a new child isn't that abnormal. \n\nIf he knows that the kids were specifically not invited because they were adopted, then yes he's an asshole. But it's not very clear that's the case. OP never talked to him about it.", "I'm guessing the brother heard some off comments from his parents about the adopted kids and didn't say anything for a reason. \n\nI was the unfavored grandchild. I doubt I'll ever have a solid relationship with my cousin, and when our grandmother died it only called more attention to the disparity in treatment, it was pervasive in our family to the point I didn't even notice it. And it left me with some level of resentment about my grandmother. I can understand why OP didn't want her kids saddled with that.", "gotcha, and totally agree. consider my reply a further clarification then for those who need it.", "yup.  because he's complaining about how op jeopardized the brother's child with the parents -- meaning the brother already knew that the parents thinking the child was biological was important to them and was gaining favors and he didn't want to cut that off by being honest in the face of their prejudice.", "Absolutely, I mean, it\u2019s not like kids might be sensitive to the risk of being rejected by their parents or anything. That never happens, it\u2019s clearly just a money issue. \n\nYou sound like the people who accuse closeted gay and trans people of being con artists ~exploiting their poor families by not disclosing. \ud83d\ude44 the dude doesn\u2019t have to disclose his reproductive functioning to his parents, jfc", ">My brother says it wasn\u2019t my secret to tell and I jeopardized his son\u2019s relationship with our parents.\n\nthis is why i think the brother is more concerned with appearances than health.  this is why i think the brother already recognized the preferential treatment the parents would have and wanted to keep it going.   \n\n\nBecause the focus wasn't on his health, his comfort, it was on how his parents would treat his kid now that they knew.  The brother is not an AH from trying to protect his child from that kind of treatment, but pretending like he wasn't doing all this to do so seems erroneous, considering this statement by OP.", "Whats the problem ? The majority of the world don\u2019t raise others kids \u2026thats y there are orphanages and kids who never get adopted\u2026theres so many single moms and men aren\u2019t signing up at high rates to raise them kids ? Live in reality you\u2019ll be better off", "OP is not a medical orofessional and has no obligation to keep SIL's medical information a secret when said information us being used for fraudulent financial gain because someone else uninvolved in her procedure wants it kept a secret.", "Except it wouldn't have been a bad relationship with his grandparents regardless, given what OP has said about the relationship her kids had before this one was born. He committed fraud to have a *better* relationship not a good one", "Exactly right.", "I\u2019m sorry you experienced that, and I appreciate your perspective", "I\u2019m thinking the grandparents probably made comment before about the adopted gk not being their \u201creal\u201d gk and that could be why the brother hid how his child was conceived.", "Lol. Ooor he knew his parents would be weird and didn't want to? Or he had weird shit about his mom finding out his divk didn't work right that he was cool with his sister knowing?\n\nLots of reasons to tell 1 person and not another. Sis is the one who got all prissy about the unfairness.", "I feel like OP did what they had to do. Wouldn\u2019t be a problem if the grandparents weren\u2019t so terrible. In these type of situations I think getting everything out might be petty but extremely necessary", "Then people better be very careful not to give me information that directly relates to why my children are being treated differently than their cousins - because my number one duty is to my children.\n\nI\u2019m not protecting the privacy of my sibling or the relationship of my niece or nephew with others at the expense of my kids.\n\nAND - I will not manipulate other people into a secondary position to my children either.\n\nIf you want me to protect your secret - your secret better not involve the manipulation and maltreatment of people I love - and certainly not people I have a duty to protect.", "I mean. I don't see why they'd be afraid they or their kid would be rejected by the grandparents when the grandparents seem to accept adopted children into the fold quite well?", "It does involve the grandparents. They are deciding how much to care about this human being based on the lies their children tell them. That directly affects both the child and the parents.", "That's... okay. You keep believing that.", "She has no legal obligation.  \n\nThe question of obligation to be a decent human and respect when things are told in confidence is quite literally what she's asking.", "Yes, it's forgivable.  But that's not the name of the sub.", "Or maybe he just didn't want to share private medical information?\n\nIf I'd conceived using sperm donation, it's not something I'd share widely.  I know my husband would not want that shared had we not conceived together. \n\nTheir parents were not entitled to the information.", "Besides it being shitty and weird? Nothing.", "because adopted children should be treated just as much as part of a family and not disfavored because of \"blood\".  Holding everything to \"blood\" is petty and means nothing, considering how much abuse comes out of blood relations.", "Because it doesn't matter? It's such a nonsense thing to care about it feels like it's just an excuse to treat OPs kids differently", "It wasn\u2019t necessary, it wasn\u2019t OP\u2019s information to share no matter what, and it doesn\u2019t seem to have solved their family problems.", "I didn\u2019t say they\u2019d fear their kid would be rejected. They might fear rejection /themselves/ for using a sperm donor especially if they did so due to infertility. A lot of people have hang ups about sperm donors. This doesn\u2019t always overlap with feelings on adoption. \n\nAlso it has the additional creepy element of intrusion into the kid\u2019s sexual and reproductive life/capacity. Parents can get very weird about thinking their kid is \u201cdefective\u201d (a totally disgusting way to see it but sadly more common than you\u2019d think because people suck).", "You don\u2019t owe people information because they choose to act terribly. If they grandparents treated the kids equally, nobody would argue they must know the truth. Just because they are awful people doesn\u2019t mean the brother has to tell them personal medical information. Brother has an obligation to speak up about unequal treatment, but absolutely does not have to reveal the origins of the child.", "I was refuting one specific aspect of the argument \"it was for his kid\", you're moving that goal post. There's no justification given for thinking a sperm donor child would be treated as less than or have a bad relationship with it's grandparents given the grandparents have been perfectly accepting of adopted grandchildren.", "I do agree with this element of the argument.\n\nIf the brother failed to address the inequality between the kids, then they are at a disadvantage. But there are many methods which can be used to address this which do not involve violation of his privacy.\n\nFor instance, had his sister let him know she felt this way, they could have had a conversation with the parents together and presented a united front.", "Ok and? OP and their spouses name are on their kids birth certificates too", "Majority of the world thinks raising kids that aren\u2019t theirs biologically is weird", "But op stated that gparents treat the kids well\u2026furthermore you cant coerce people into feeling how you want them to feel or how you think they should feel", "Lol clearly it matters..tf\u2026the gparents want bio gkids nothing wring with that \u2026gay ppl want what they want nothing wrong with that\u2026feminists want what they want nothing wrong with that \u2026 women want what they want nothing wrong with that \u2026\u2026..", "Oh no not solved at all, with these grandparents it probably will never be solved. But I like the truth being out there and everyone getting treated the same especially if the other person was lying to benefit. I probably would have done the same thing", "People who lie about how their children were conceived are in toxic relationships that can harm their children. Eventually it could become obvious the child isn't biologically theirs, and then what? How will that affect the child? Were the parents going to lie to the child as well, or tell the child the truth and force them to lie to their grandparents? The only possible reason the brother lied is that he already knew his parents would treat the kid differently.  \n\nWould it be ok if the kid turns 14 and comes out as gay, but the father doesn't let them know and forces the kid to lie about it in order to keep the grandparents happy and generous?", "Yes, it is a lie. When the parents continuously stress the *biological* grandchild and the brother doesn\u2019t correct them, he is knowingly letting them believe false information and lying by omission.", "But the grandparents are affected by this information. They believed that this new grandchild was biological their son's and both stated that belief and acted on it by buying said grandchild more presents than they had their adopted grandchildren.", "The situation is more complex.  If that's moving goal posts to you, okay.  I concede it's likely the grandparents would have been decent ... until a biological grandchild came along, apparently."]}
