They\u2019ve never mentioned to me or my husband, or to the kids, anything about having a problem that I adopted instead of having biological children. \n\nMy brother and his wife have a 3 month old son, who was conceived with a sperm donor. I know this because my brother\u2019s wife talked about it with me, but my parents were not aware. They treated my nephew the same as they treated my kids when they were babies, so I\u2019ve never been concerned that my kids would be seen as lesser because they\u2019re adopted while my nephew was supposedly their biological grandchild.\n\nWhich is why I was so surprised and confused that my parents have been talking about how excited they are to have their first Christmas with their biological grandchild, and that they did a big expensive holiday photoshoot with my brother, his wife, and his son, something they\u2019ve never done with my kids (they were the ones who suggested it to my brother, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s just because he asked and I didn\u2019t).\n\nThe weirdest part was that they casually mentioned some of the things they bought for my nephew for Christmas, as far as I can tell they\u2019re spending more on him than they are for my three kids combined, and it\u2019s far more than what they spent even when my oldest was a baby. In fact, when my kids were little they used to say there was no point buying expensive things for babies for Christmases or birthdays because they wouldn\u2019t remember it, and they\u2019d rather spend the money when they\u2019re a little older.\n\nSo my nephew is suddenly being favored over my kids, at the same time my parents are starting to emphasize the fact that, as far as they know, my nephew is their biological grandchild. I pointed this out to them and said it bothers me, they denied treating them differently, they said I was being weird about money (I truly don\u2019t care about the money, I care about the difference in treatment and that my kids might notice how little they\u2019re getting from my parents compared to their cousin).\n\nAnd now for the part I\u2019m starting to feel awful about: I told them the truth about my nephew. My parents are furious at my brother for not telling them and thanked me for telling the truth. They keep saying he tricked them and gave them false hope about having a biological grandchild, which I guess answers the question on whether biology actually mattered to them. My husband says I did the right thing because it removed all the lies and secrets, and if they didn\u2019t care it wouldn\u2019t matter but if they did care they deserved to know. My brother says it wasn\u2019t my secret to tell and I jeopardized his son\u2019s relationship with our parents.", "created_utc": 1671858127, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zu2957/aita_for_telling_my_parents_they_still_dont_have/", "score": 317, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He knew his parents were excited about having a \u201cbiological\u201d grandchild and he let them believe this to be true when he knew it wasn\u2019t the case so that he could reap the benefits. This is more of an ESH. Parents the most then OP and the brother.", ">You were set on hurting your parents by taking away the \u201cbiological\u201d grandchild\n\nYou can\u2019t take away what they never had..\n\nBrother never corrected their assumptions and never planned to. It was a lie of omission and he is angry the truth was revealed.", "I agree.with ESH but I don't thinm the brother is completely innocent either. His commet about ' jeopardizing his son's relationship with GPs' kind of suggests he was all about reaping benefits he got as the 'real' grandson of the family.", "It\u2019s fine to want biological descendants. It\u2019s not okay to change up how the nonbiological grandkids are treated. After doting on them for years it\u2019s clear they are *less valued* then the latest addition to the family the grandparents wrongly thought was the first bio grandchild.\n\nTo me, that\u2019s what I found upsetting. I just had my first child a few months ago. Yes I would love grandchildren one day but that\u2019s not up to me. I could only choose to have this child, who may or may not want to have their own.", "Don\u2019t know why you\u2019re being downvoted for the truth", "I believe this is changing after a number of donor conceived children have learned that the fertility doctors who made those recommendations also withheld or lied about vital health information. \n\nFor folks generally curious at how bad these situations have been, look up Donald Cline and Cecil Jacobson for examples of how terrible fertility doctors can be in sperm donor contexts. Outside of those situations, my friend is donor conceived and her mom was told that the donor was given out a maximum of 10 times \u2014 e.g. my friend would have no more than 10 siblings, *if* it took all 10 times. \n\nThey\u2019re up to 15 siblings now. And they\u2019re not even out of the date range the *fertility clinic* gave for when they stopped using this donor. \n\nAnd yeah, the clinic her siblings all came from advised their parents against telling them they were donor conceived. Turns out they\u2019re all at high risk for *serious* health stuff because they never sought a complete medical history from the dude. \n\nAll this to say is \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t trust a medical professional who would advise withholding serious medical information from a person for their entire lives. My friend always knew they were donor conceived, but almost half of her siblings had no idea until after the DNA test came back. That\u2019s hella traumatic. Then to find out they\u2019re also at high risk for MS, cancer and a bunch of other stuff? I personally wouldn\u2019t enjoy that much. \n\nTell your kids they\u2019re donor conceived. Please.", "I have to imagine that a lot of times, the kid doesn't look anything like the dad and people figure out something doesn't look right", "The adopted kids will grow up and realize that their grandparents treat their \u201cbiological\u201d grandchild better than they do them. \n\nThis will cause the kids pain because they will realize that grandma and grandpa love them less because they\u2019re not \u201creal family\u201d.\n\nThose are the consequences.", "He doesn't need to divulge his medical information to his parents, especially if he doesn't trust them to keep it a secret. He trusted OP to keep it a secret and look where that went. \n\n\nIt sucks what the parents were doing/saying, but the brother didn't have to use that opportunity to give away personal information.", "The parents are not entitled to his medical information, what on earth kind of take is that.", "I think that's a leap. Maybe brother knew what the parents are like even if OP doesn't. Maybe brother didn't want to discuss his reproductive life with his parents. Some people are super open about the details of conception, and some are not. There are plenty of people who use sperm/egg donors or other ART, and have no interest in discussing it with anyone but their partners and kids. Nobody else is entitled to know the status and usage of his sperm, even if they act like jackasses in their ignorance.", "For sure, but is he AH for keeping quiet and reaping the benefits of his parents' flawed thinking?", "And Cecil Jacobson used HIS OWN SPERM as the donor sperm!  A total disgusting weirdo!", "I understand your point and I do feel divided on the issue. What doesn\u2019t sit right with me, that he\u2019s enabling a grandparent - grandchild relationship based on lies.", "While that\u2019s true, is it ok to base relationships on misinformation/ lies?"]}
