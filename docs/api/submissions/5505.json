They\u2019ve never mentioned to me or my husband, or to the kids, anything about having a problem that I adopted instead of having biological children. \n\nMy brother and his wife have a 3 month old son, who was conceived with a sperm donor. I know this because my brother\u2019s wife talked about it with me, but my parents were not aware. They treated my nephew the same as they treated my kids when they were babies, so I\u2019ve never been concerned that my kids would be seen as lesser because they\u2019re adopted while my nephew was supposedly their biological grandchild.\n\nWhich is why I was so surprised and confused that my parents have been talking about how excited they are to have their first Christmas with their biological grandchild, and that they did a big expensive holiday photoshoot with my brother, his wife, and his son, something they\u2019ve never done with my kids (they were the ones who suggested it to my brother, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s just because he asked and I didn\u2019t).\n\nThe weirdest part was that they casually mentioned some of the things they bought for my nephew for Christmas, as far as I can tell they\u2019re spending more on him than they are for my three kids combined, and it\u2019s far more than what they spent even when my oldest was a baby. In fact, when my kids were little they used to say there was no point buying expensive things for babies for Christmases or birthdays because they wouldn\u2019t remember it, and they\u2019d rather spend the money when they\u2019re a little older.\n\nSo my nephew is suddenly being favored over my kids, at the same time my parents are starting to emphasize the fact that, as far as they know, my nephew is their biological grandchild. I pointed this out to them and said it bothers me, they denied treating them differently, they said I was being weird about money (I truly don\u2019t care about the money, I care about the difference in treatment and that my kids might notice how little they\u2019re getting from my parents compared to their cousin).\n\nAnd now for the part I\u2019m starting to feel awful about: I told them the truth about my nephew. My parents are furious at my brother for not telling them and thanked me for telling the truth. They keep saying he tricked them and gave them false hope about having a biological grandchild, which I guess answers the question on whether biology actually mattered to them. My husband says I did the right thing because it removed all the lies and secrets, and if they didn\u2019t care it wouldn\u2019t matter but if they did care they deserved to know. My brother says it wasn\u2019t my secret to tell and I jeopardized his son\u2019s relationship with our parents.", "created_utc": 1671858127, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zu2957/aita_for_telling_my_parents_they_still_dont_have/", "score": 838, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is the fraud still forgivable if OP\u2019s brother is aware OPs kids will now be treated worse? \n\nI still think it\u2019s an ESH, because it sounds like he fully knew that the grandparents would favor a bio child over non bio and was choosing to let his child be the favorite, and let himself be the favorite, knowing it would cause the other kids harm.", "Fraud isn't okay just because it's used to directly benefit your kids. Just ask Lori Laughlin.", "Lol no not forgivable\n\nEdit: to add because I'm not sure people understand what my point here is and how angry I am at this thread's starter.\n\n\nYou don't get to tell a family they're not a real family. \nYou don't get to say to a child that their parents aren't 'real' \nYou don't get to then have another kid come along that's 'better'\nThe grandparents are assholes full stop.", "So did Donald cline. There\u2019s a Netflix doc on it", "He was prioritizing the wellbeing of his child over the wellbeing of his parents, which is IMO the right decision considering how childish his parents are being.", "[deleted]", "Oh, gotcha. Sorry, I misunderstood your comment.", "I think the original poster you replied to saying OP isn't a saint either is used to ESH being 'Everyones an asshole but you suck a lot less'", "\u201cI say, boy, I *am* the father.\u201d", "Now that\u2019s an angle I hadn\u2019t thought of.", "\"I say, I say, boy! Your my son, Boy!\"", "I still find the fraud forgivable.  He is first and foremost accountable to his son.\n\nHe's an asshole for not also protecting his brother's kids and calling his parents out on their toxic behavior.  So many toxic things thrive because people stand by and do nothing.", "There are lies to protect yourself and then there are lies through which you gain advantage. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s black and white and lies are always bad. There are situations, where one has to do what one has to do in order to survive or to get out. In my personal opinion they are justified. \n\nNot telling your parents that the grandchild is not biologically theirs when they keep insisting how happy they are to finally have a blood and flash bio grandkid and by extension benefiting the situation, is in the latter category based on my moral compass\u2026\n\nIn a similar situation to OP, would you stand back and watch your children being mistreated because of lies? If we go with the theory that both set of parents (OP and brother) are protecting their families, then who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong? We don\u2019t know why the brother let this go on, just that he never corrected any assumptions and never done anything against the favouritism.", "No, it sounds like the grandparents treated all the grandkids nicely until there was a perceived bio grandkid in the picture and then treated \u201cbio\u201d grandkid in a way that would cause harm to all of the grandkids in the future, including the \u201cbio\u201d one. At best, the favoured grandkid would feel weird about that when they were old enough to be aware and have all that family trauma to deal with in the future.\n\nI agree it wasn\u2019t OPs secret to tell but I don\u2019t think we can say that all would have been sunshine lollipops and rainbows if everyone just put the parents on an information diet.", "We definitaly do not know that the brother has never done anything against the favoritism. That is an unfounded assumption that you're making. OP never had a conversation with her brother about her concerns before outing him so we don't know what has been said between the brother and the parents.\n\nThe reason OP's behavior was problematic and her brother's was not was that OP wasn't protecting her family. She felt that her brother's child was receiving preferential treatment and tried to undermine the relationship instead of addressing the root problem that her parents were not acknowledging her children as full members of their family. \n\nThere were alternative ways of addressing the inequity that do not involve breaking her brother's trust. She could have talked to him about her concerns and asked him to support her when she brings up his concerns to their parents. She could have also have addressed her parents favoritism without involving the sperm donation at all. \n\nHer solution was to try and drive a wedge between her brother (as well as his child) and her parents, and it worked."]}
