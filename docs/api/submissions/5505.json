{"id": 5505, "submission_id": "zu2957", "title": "AITA for telling my parents they still don\u2019t have a biological grandchild?", "selftext": "I have 3 adopted children, and my parents have so far been good grandparents to them. They\u2019ve never mentioned to me or my husband, or to the kids, anything about having a problem that I adopted instead of having biological children. \n\nMy brother and his wife have a 3 month old son, who was conceived with a sperm donor. I know this because my brother\u2019s wife talked about it with me, but my parents were not aware. They treated my nephew the same as they treated my kids when they were babies, so I\u2019ve never been concerned that my kids would be seen as lesser because they\u2019re adopted while my nephew was supposedly their biological grandchild.\n\nWhich is why I was so surprised and confused that my parents have been talking about how excited they are to have their first Christmas with their biological grandchild, and that they did a big expensive holiday photoshoot with my brother, his wife, and his son, something they\u2019ve never done with my kids (they were the ones who suggested it to my brother, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s just because he asked and I didn\u2019t).\n\nThe weirdest part was that they casually mentioned some of the things they bought for my nephew for Christmas, as far as I can tell they\u2019re spending more on him than they are for my three kids combined, and it\u2019s far more than what they spent even when my oldest was a baby. In fact, when my kids were little they used to say there was no point buying expensive things for babies for Christmases or birthdays because they wouldn\u2019t remember it, and they\u2019d rather spend the money when they\u2019re a little older.\n\nSo my nephew is suddenly being favored over my kids, at the same time my parents are starting to emphasize the fact that, as far as they know, my nephew is their biological grandchild. I pointed this out to them and said it bothers me, they denied treating them differently, they said I was being weird about money (I truly don\u2019t care about the money, I care about the difference in treatment and that my kids might notice how little they\u2019re getting from my parents compared to their cousin).\n\nAnd now for the part I\u2019m starting to feel awful about: I told them the truth about my nephew. My parents are furious at my brother for not telling them and thanked me for telling the truth. They keep saying he tricked them and gave them false hope about having a biological grandchild, which I guess answers the question on whether biology actually mattered to them. My husband says I did the right thing because it removed all the lies and secrets, and if they didn\u2019t care it wouldn\u2019t matter but if they did care they deserved to know. My brother says it wasn\u2019t my secret to tell and I jeopardized his son\u2019s relationship with our parents.", "created_utc": 1671858127, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zu2957/aita_for_telling_my_parents_they_still_dont_have/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It wasn't your secret to tell. You were wrong to do it that way. But grandparents are super AH, and so is your brother. \n\nHere's what would have been above board. Go to bro, tell him what you've seen and how it makes you feel, then tell him that he needs to tell his parents,  and if he doesn't, you will. \n\nBut you didn't. So. Acknowledge that you handled your part badly but that doesn't excuse everyone else's way worse behavior.", "ESH- your parents for blatantly favoring your brother's kid because of perceived biological relations; you for divulging your brother and SIL's business; and your brother for not being upset that the relationship between his kid and your parents was contingent on DNA.", "NTA - I\u2019m prepared to be downvoted, but I\u2019m willing to bet brother knew exactly how your parents felt about your kids and withheld the truth from them because he knew how they\u2019d react. Sure, it was their info to tell, but they had no intention of saying anything of the like because they were enjoying the benefits that came with keeping their mouths shut. Your brother did not care that you or your kids were being treated differently or unfairly because he wasn\u2019t on the receiving end. Now that he is, he cares about privacy. Your actions might\u2019ve been sus, but that doesn\u2019t make you the asshole here. Your brother, however, is. He was willing to do his own son a disservice by setting him up with a false relationship with his grandparents while teaching him that your kids were okay to be treated as less than. Nah, he got his just desserts, he just didn\u2019t count on eating them this soon.", "ESH, your parents should be treating all grandkids the same regardless if they\u2019re biological. But you should\u2019ve talked to your brother first instead of going behind his back", "ESH.  It wasn\u2019t your secret to tell.  It doesn\u2019t matter if your parents were being awful.  Your brother trusted you and you betrayed his confidence.  Period.\n\nBut your brother also let the charade with your parents continue.  And your parents, yikes.", "ESH.  Your parents are the biggest AHs, as they clearly don't treat your children the same as your brother's kid, and continually lied to you about this. You are an AH for sharing this information with your parents without at least giving your brother a chance to share it himself with them. Your brother is an AH because he was purposely deceiving and lying to your parents in order for them to have a better (false) relationship with his kid (which seems to acknowledge he knew they had a problem with your kids being adopted). And it sounds like he had no intention of ever telling your parents the truth.  Contrary to what some others have commented, he is not an innocent victim or bystander in this. If you create a lie, especially about something so large as this, don't be mad with the ramifications if you get caught.", "NTA. Does it suck for your brother? Yes. But it\u2019s frankly completely unreasonable to expect you to keep a secret when the secret is resulting in clear deleterious consequences for you and your children", "ESH\n\nYou had no right to tell them anything. Your parents would have found out at some point. They always do. You had issues with how they favored his child over your children, I can understand your frustration, but in the end, it will be the grandparents who regret that decision.\n\nMy in-laws favored my BIL's kids over ours. They took them on numerous trips and spoiled them with love and attention while our kids only received the minimum attention. Once everyone grew up, they regretted missing out on their other grandkids' lives.", "ESH\n\nThe grandparents are clear assholes.\n\nBut what you did was awful.  Essentially you were jealous of someone so you tried to bring them back down to your level.  That you harmed your brother without even considering the harm it would cause him makes it worse.  You were set on hurting your parents by taking away the \u201cbiological\u201d grandchild and proving that they were lying to you about it not mattering.\n\nYour brother was an innocent bystander that you chose not to care about.\n\nI\u2019d apologize to your brother and hopefully you have permanently damaged that relationship.", "ESH. Your parents for their obvious favoritism. And you for sharing information that, as your brother said, was not yours to share. Your only intention was to bring down your nephew, who\u2019s totally innocent in all of this. Not cool.", "ESH. That was probably not something they planned on sharing.", "ESH. Echoing what others have did, it wasn't your place. Your parents awful for treating their grandchildren that way.", "ESH\n\nIt was not you secret to tell.", "ESH. I'll never understand this obsession that people have with bloodlines and whether or not a child is biologically 'theirs.'\n\nYour parents are genuinely terrible for the favoritism they're displaying in treating your adopted children as 'lesser.'\n\nAt the same time, your brother's secret wasn't yours to tell", "NTA. Your brother ( for withholding the truth when he benefits) and your parents (for blatant favoritism) are the AHs here. I sure hope you have other family that aren\u2019t so creepily fixated on DNA.", "INFO Why was there a need for a sperm donor?\n\nIf you tell me your brother is sterile or basically sterile. You are a complete YTA. Of course your parents are too for blatant favoritisim towards biology. You are one too for giving personal info bout your brother to both your parents.\n\nYou wanted nothing more to hurt and prove your point to your parents. In the process hurting your nephew. Outing your brother's possible medical condition. Their private life. You also proved you are a bad person to tell private info too.\n\nBest of luck to you.", "Nta, but a tiny tiny bit an AH. Should have cleared it with the brother first if that could have been a conversation, but otherwise, your parents are the major AH here for playing favorites. Good for you to stand your ground", "NTA, you needed to tell your parents because they really did need to know. If they found out years later there could have been way worse repercussions to deal with including your parents getting mad at you for knowing and not letting them know.", "YTA you violated your brothers confidence and basically outed him to better your point", "ESH. This was not your story to tell. When people treat your children without respect, you set up boundaries and/or withdraw from them. You don't go around and tell thinks you were told in confidence to \"get back at them\".\n\nHonestly, you should go low contact with your parents and ask your brother and SIL for forgiveness.", "ESH\n\nYour brother is right. It was not your secret to tell. Don't misunderstand, I get it. That doesn't mean you don't suck.", "NTA", "ESH\n\nYour parents the biggest ones but as your brother said it wasn't your place to tell them.", "NTA brother shouldn't be lying especially when he could see parents reaction to their 'biological' child which is bs imo. What a shame they can't just love all these children unconditionally and be excited that you are both growing your own family units. It doesn't sound like brother ever planned on telling them and was going to ride on the wave of  their gift giving.", "ESH", "YTA\n\nWhile your parents definitely suck here, the question was if you are the AH for telling them what you did and you are. That wasn't your information to tell, and you shouldn't have used it as a weapon.", "YTA  you did this to hurt your parents because you were hurt. But in doing so you completely threw your brother under the bus. Fertility issues are VERY personal & you had no right telling them your brothers medical issues.", "YTA. Wasn't your secret to tell. You also have 3 kids to his one. Bet holidays will be fun lol. Jealousy sucks especially when it's a grown ass adults jealous of a baby.", "YTA - you can be hurt by your parents - you can have an argument about favouritism with them and your brother, but this was nothing to be exposed by you. You should feel ashamed.", "ESH\n\n* You should have confronted your brother or sister-in-law about confessing before going to your parents.\n* Your reason for exposing the truth seems more rooted in spite than actually being considerate about your parent's feelings.\n* Your brother or sister-in-law should have let your parents down early.\n* Your parents are playing favorites with their grandkids.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
