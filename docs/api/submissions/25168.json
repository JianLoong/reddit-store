He was out of work until earlier this year. We live in Ireland so he was getting unemployment assistance which was enough to cover his mortgage however when it was paid he only was eft with a small amount of money each month. So I told him he could move in with me (one bed apartment) until he got a new job. During that time I paid all the bills, food, took him on a holiday and lent him money every now and then.\n\nWhen he got a job earlier this year, he needed to buy some new work clothes, etc so I lent him \u20ac900 on the basis I would get it back over 3 months starting 2 months after he began working. This was to allow him to build up a bit of money after starting his new job. He agreed to this however to date, which is 6 months after starting his new job, he hasn't given me any of this money back.\n\nI'm not worried about the small bits of money I lent him during the time he was off but \u20ac900 is a lot of money to me and I could to with it at the moment. He is also still living with me and is not contributing to the utility bills (we both work from home at least 3 days per week so lighting and heating is expensive). He contributes \u20ac50-\u20ac100 per month for food but the actual food is costing \u20ac400 per month. As it coming into Autumn and the weather will be turning colder I will need to order another fill of heating oil and get fuel (wood and co-\" for the fire (all of which I paid for last year). I also I V to drive him to and from the train station at least two early mornings and two late evenings every week.\n\nWhat is really annoying me is he is now spending lots of money on clothes and going out each week with his new colleagues and talking about booking more holidays (we're only back from a week abroad) while he has not repaid me or is contributing to the utility bills. I don't begrudge him the new clothes or going out with his new friends but I feel he should contribute to the utility bills and repay the \u20ac900 before doing any of this.\n\nAlTA for getting angry about this and I'm now thinking of breaking up with him.

It seems to me like there are two options here. Either he's actively using you to fund his lifestyle by pretending to forget that he owes you money, or he's really unaware of the fact that he owes you money.\n\n  \nIn this cases, the best thing to do is communicate clearly. Just straight up ask him when he's going to pay you back because life is expensive and you'd appreciate being able to budget your money and know how much you're counting on for your own stuff.\n\n  \nAs for living together and him not paying utilities, enough for food, etc, also a conversation needs to happen. Lay it all out and tell him what everything costs and directly ask him to contribute to it.\n\n  \nIf he responds negatively to that, it's time to let him go.

Ask him for it first but if that still is  no reconsider him", "Time to sit down and set up a payment plan for the money you've lent him and outline how much he's going to start paying.

You have every right to be angry!", "You're definitely NTA but have you spoken to him about all of this?

He is a nice guy but he needs a push to do anything.
