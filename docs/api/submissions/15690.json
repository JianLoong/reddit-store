In the settlement, my mom got 1 out of 2 homes that my dad had purchased, as well as alimony for 10 years. The house was mortgaged, and she said she would keep it for a year and sell it. Years passed, and I tried hard to get her to finally move so she wouldn\u2019t drain her finances, but nothing worked.\n\nIn the past 10 years, she developed some pretty serious hoarding habits. She got involved with an organization that accepted donations, and her house basically became a storage unit of random crap. Every once in a while I would help her clean up, and she would not want to throw away or donate anything of hers or any leftovers from the organization after it closed. We would usually end up fighting. The hoarding got so bad that no one was allowed to visit, (including my brother and I ).  She bought a small apt in 2012 and it has been completely empty since 2014. I tried to no avail to get her to pack, sell the house and move to the small apt for YEARS. \n\nFast forward to today. She drained her investments and now ALL her money is tied to the house. Now she wants my help to pack, declutter and move. But now we are in a hurry. I need to lend her the money for next month\u2019s mortgage / maintenance (6k or so) because she\u2019s down to zero. Her husband works doing Uber eats and what he makes is what is keeping food in the table. Before she called to ask for help, I was in the middle of passing my exams to become a registered architect (6 pretty tough exams) I stopped everything and have risked my future and my job for the last 6 weeks. (I work remotely and have neglected my job and my house / husband, to help her pack).\n\nWhen I\u2019m there, All I get from her is yelling, sarcasm and temper tantrums. The house is in complete chaos.. She still doesn\u2019t want to get rid of stuff and will sit down with her collection of garbage and stare at it, cry over it, and won\u2019t take action. She also won\u2019t let me do anything on my own and will want to micro-manage everything I do. It\u2019s unbearable, and makes me feel im wasting precious time.\n\nThis has taken a big toll on my mental health and today after a usual tantrum, I told her I won\u2019t be coming back after May 4th. There is a chance she could lose the house if she doesn\u2019t move in time. She has a mild mobility issue and a previous heart attack. I feel really bad, but I just can\u2019t take it anymore and feel like im just wasting my time anyway. Am I the asshole for not coming back to help my own mother ?\n\nTLDR : My mother blew all her divorce money and now wants me to bail her out and help her move, but constantly disrespects and yells at me when I\u2019m there, and I\u2019m sick of it (I\u2019m risking my job and my future doing this) so I don\u2019t want to come back to help even though she could lose her house.", "created_utc": 1682470444, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12z1o9p/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_mom_move_when_shes/", "score": 115, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

First and foremost, get back to finishing your degree and secure your future.  Don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm.  \n\nFace it, you lost your mother years ago.  You need to immediately go no contact with her (block her number, social media, emails, etc).  Let her reap the consequences of her actions.  It is now right to let her suffer by losing the house and everything in it.  She deserves all the pain and suffering coming her way.\n\nYou do not owe her a damn thing, and you need to focus on you now.  Do not return to her home at all.  Don't wait until the 4th.  Drop the rope with her NOW.  It also goes without saying, do not give her a cent of your money.  \n\nI know it's tough, but this is what's best for you.  Who cares if she has mental instabilities - that is not your problem.  Let her suffer and take pride in her suffering, that's the best kind of closure you can get.\n\nInternet hugs and best wishes to you", "NTA. Even the disrespect and tantrums aside, it's not fair or healthy for you to save her from herself.

You have now invested so much in helping you are endangering your future, yet she refuses anything that would prevent her from drowning.\n\nThere is nothing you can do to prevent this from occurring. She is a bottomless pit of need. Stand aside and focus on ensuring *your* future stability.\n\nThis is also an example of how you cannot change others, you can only change yourself. Your mother is locked into a self destructive path. You cannot change that. You can only change how you react to it.", "This, sadly. She has an illness, and she's an adult who needs to decide that she's ready for therapy and help.

It\u2019s tough when it\u2019s close family and you feel you can\u2019t do anything for them, but you are right, perhaps that is the only thing that will teach her.

I\u2019m wondering now if that could be a component. Problem is, that makes me feel even more guilty for not helping. But the truth is I don\u2019t know what to do.

Helping her pack will never work anyway, as you clearly know by now. I live with a hoarder, so I know what you're feeling. A person with hoarding tendencies HAS to touch/inspect every item, and they become indecisive and irritable. Especially when you try to rush them. Unfortunately she is out of time! Since it sounds like there is equity in the house, it would be a crying shame to let it go to foreclosure. If the Notice of Default has already been filed, you can get the process delayed. If you want to help your mom, assist her with contacting the mortgage company and tell them you're selling the house and will be paying off the loan at close of escrow.They will usually work with you. Since you're on limited time, and are considering covering her mortgage next month; might I make a suggestion. Don't make that payment. It will cost less to get a storage unit, hire some movers, and get that house on the market asap. Explain to your mom that if you put everything in a storage unit (or 3 lol) then she will have time to sort her belongings and go thru the purge process at a pace she is comfortable with. You may also suggest a professional to help her with this task when she's ready to begin. Someone qualified to work with hoarders. Then you can wash your hands of it. Even if she keeps every single thing forever, at least it will only cost a few hundred a month in storage fees vs thousands per month she has been bleeding for YEARS. Good luck, I know it's hard.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nAs a good rule of thumb, sorting and packing should only be done by the person that's actually moving. Feel free to help her load or unload things that have already been sorted and packed, though.\n\nAlso, she's already on the hook for $6k of *your* money... you basically get to call all the shots here.\n\nFinally, do what's best for you, and please don't jeopardize your future career over something like this.\n\nGood luck!", "Wow thank you this is a great idea! She already wants to do the storage thing, but we\u2019ve been slowly selecting what goes where, and like you said the whole touching and inspecting everything really takes a lot of time and drives me nuts! But this is much better than than, and calling the mortgage company is also great. Thank you so much !", "The issue is that because of that, she took like 15 years to sort and pack lol . I\u2019m trying to call the shots for that precise reason, but it\u2019s not working which is making me want to step away entirely.", "If you do help her pay for the first month of a storage unit, make sure it\u2019s in her name so that it won\u2019t hurt your credit when she defaults on it.", "I hope she can get on board with the idea. It may help to explain that you can only take 2 days off for this (or whatever timeline you feel comfortable with). Move a load of essentials to the apartment, like beds, couch, table, a few dishes and linens... and some of her favorite tchotchkes. Then do loads of everything else to the storage unit. She will definitely want to supervise all of this but hopefully she will stay at the apartment once that load is moved over, or hopefully she'll get too tired to follow the movers around her house all day. You may have to promise not to throw one single thing away. Optimally, if she's willing to, maybe offer to send her to a spa day so she can de-stress while you guys move everything. She probably won't want to, so try to let her \"be in charge\" on moving day. And try not to worry about the thought of foreclosure; don't tell your mom this, but it can take months or even years to get foreclosed on. Especially if she's not in default yet. You probably have more time than you think, so don't sweat too much about that part.", "You should probably step away entirely. Maybe not forever, but you really need to take care of yourself first before taking care of someone else.\n\nAs others have pointed out, she's probably suffering from a kind of mental disorder and needs actual professional help.", "NTA. She has ruined her own life despite your best efforts, and she'll ruin yours too if you allow it. There's nothing you can do as long as she insists to live in denial.", "NTA - I went through something similar though not as extreme with my mum. In the end I sorted out a new flat for her and then had to let her lose the house along with all the stuff inside before she realised what she needed to do.   \nHoarding is an awful condition for both those who suffer from it and those who have loved ones who who suffer from it.", "NTA. You have very good reasons here", "YTA for doing this to yourself and your husband. Leave and don't look back.", "Also She\u2019s very sick and really needs help.  Hoarding is an anxiety disorder and only a specialist who deals with that should be doing it.  OP needs to save themselves and tell her to get real help.", "Was looking for a comment like this!", ">Her husband works\n\nSounds like she has help. Someone that has helped her collect all the crap."]}
