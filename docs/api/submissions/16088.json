They had a housewarming party on Friday and Lucy spent most of the night dancing with her own friends who are very like her (excitable extroverted e.g) and dragging Danny away from his conversations with us (his friends) to dance even though he's more like us (introverted not party animals)\n\nLater Danny was being quiet so I asked if he was okay and he said just tired, but he just kept watching Lucy dancing and then said something in her ear the next time she came over and she just shook her head and laughed at him. After she went back to her friends I asked if it was bothering him how she was behaving and he asked me to explain. I mentioned the attention seeking dancing and the fact she was wearing something really revealing even though other guys were at this party. Danny said it didn't bother him then sat with a moody face.\n\nAt the end of the night Lucy sat down with us and started chatting non stop about how amazing the party had been. I pointed out jokingly Danny obviously wasn't enjoying himself since he looked miserable, and Danny told her I was worried he was jealous because of her outfit. Lucy ruffled his hair (which he hates) and said he was quiet because he loved her outfit so much he couldn't wait for us all to leave so he could \"drag\" her to bed. I thought that was completely inappropriate and said to Danny in that case I'd leave if she was just going to be disgusting and Lucy just laughed at me so I did leave.\n\nToday Danny has messaged me saying Lucy wants an apology before I'm allowed back at their home but when I asked if Lucy will apologize for making me uncomfortable he said no she doesn't have anything to be sorry about.\n\nI was genuinely only worried about my friend but admit I could have just left without calling her disgusting so AITA?\n\nETA - to clarify I didn't say the comment about her clothes directly to Lucy, I asked Danny once then never mentioned it again. I asked him because I know in the past he's said anything overly sexual makes him uncomfortable. He's not the kind of guy who makes innuendos or anything\nAlso I'm in no way jealous of Lucy, she's the opposite of how I'd want to be (which is fine people can be who they want) and Danny and I already tried dating years ago but the spark wasn't there and it was uncomfortable after we tried being intimate and we BOTH agreed we were better as completely platonic friends", "created_utc": 1682899838, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1347bo7/aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_his_gf_is/", "score": 5001, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And mysogynistic.\n\nWomen can wear whatever they want - even if *gasp* other men are around.\n\nCouples throwing a house party EXPECT each other to interact with the other's friends. \n\nSex is not disgusting. She didn't go into detail - she just didn't let you slut shame her.", "YTA. You sound jealous lol", "YTA and a jealous one at that.\n\nEdit to add: Danny was uncomfortable because of the way you were acting.", "YTA. It\u2019s his relationship, not yours. Just because something is bothering you doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bothering him. Commenting on whether he was OK with her wardrobe makes you look controlling - because it is.

I think you need to step back and asses your feelings before interacting with them again.", "YTA If he doesn't like it, it's on him to talk to her or break up with her.

You would absolutely hate the parties I go to lol", "YTA\n\nYou're jealous and you think you know this guy so well that you can speak for him. You are losing him to his gf and his life and you're scared.\n\nPerhaps you don't understand other women because you should know we don't wear certain clothes or enjoy dancing to turn anyone else on.

What on earth would make you think you have a single ounce of authority over this woman's behavior or choice of clothing? What would make you say something like that to anyone, let alone someone your friend obviously cares about deeply?

All that checks out. \n\nBut just because you are also an introvert doesn't mean you and Danny have the exact feelings. He never mentioned her outfit or dancing, YOU did. He only mentioned being tired then watching his partner dance, which, as an introvert I can agree dancing drains me and I'd rather watch my partner have fun. \n\nStop projecting, take a step back, and maybe, idk, talk to your friend and figure out how he Actually feels about things instead of guessing/projecting....Also decide if this is worth not going over to your friends house anymore or if you can such it up and get over the fact you jus", "yta girls that hate other girls are scary", "YTA big time.", "YTA.

It can be hard when friends find a SO, and harder still when they move in together, and friends (of any gender!) can feel like they\u2019re being replaced by the romantic partner. The challenge is that the way you\u2019re acting will only drive more of a wedge between you and Danny.

They had a housewarming party on Friday and Lucy spent most of the night dancing with her own friends who are very like her (excitable extroverted e.g) and dragging Danny away from his conversations with us (his friends) to dance even though he's more like us (introverted not party animals)\n\nLater Danny was being quiet so I asked if he was okay and he said just tired, but he just kept watching Lucy dancing and then said something in her ear the next time she came over and she just shook her head and laughed at him. After she went back to her friends I asked if it was bothering him how she was behaving and he asked me to explain. I mentioned the attention seeking dancing and the fact she was wearing something really revealing even though other guys were at this party. Danny said it didn't bother him then sat with a moody face.\n\nAt the end of the night Lucy sat down with us and started chatting non stop about how amazing the party had been. I pointed out jokingly Danny obviously wasn't enjoying himself since he looked miserable, and Danny told her I was worried he was jealous because of her outfit. Lucy ruffled his hair (which he hates) and said he was quiet because he loved her outfit so much he couldn't wait for us all to leave so he could \"drag\" her to bed. I thought that was completely inappropriate and said to Danny in that case I'd leave if she was just going to be disgusting and Lucy just laughed at me so I did leave.\n\nToday Danny has messaged me saying Lucy wants an apology before I'm allowed back at their home but when I asked if Lucy will apologize for making me uncomfortable he said no she doesn't have anything to be sorry about.\n\nI was genuinely only worried about my friend but admit I could have just left without calling her disgusting so AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I would love to hang out with her. You sound like a slut shaming sourpuss", "YTA. Jealous much?   You were upset that his girlfriend wanted yo dance with him.  Then when, you made a comment about the way she was dressed he had a pissed off look on his face. You were trying to cause trouble between them. Like really.

And when it didn\u2019t work with him he tried it with her. \n\nYou owe both of them an apology for the things you said and the way you acted.", "YTA. Your first clue that you were gonna be the AH here was when Danny didn\u2019t even know what you were talking about when you asked him if he was upset with her behavior. \n\nOP, you are way too young for this pearl-clutching nonsense. You remind me of the nuns in Catholic school. If you want to keep your friend, you\u2019ll apologize to Lucy for insulting her for having a good time in her own home. She, on the other hand, owes you nothing.", "YTA. For judging and insulting someone doing nothing more than enjoying herself at a party in her own home with her friends.

YTA for several reasons: assuming you know better about your friend\u2019s relationship than he does, thinking you have the right to police his girlfriend\u2019s clothing and behavior, being flat out rude to both of them, and doubling down when called on your behavior. If you think a woman\u2019s clothing or dancing is attention seeking, guess what? You can choose not to pay attention to it. Wearing a certain thing or dancing a certain way is not an open invitation to be treated poorly.\n\nEdit: I absolutely thought this whole post was written by a man, and now I think it\u2019s even worse that it isn\u2019t.

Why do you care if she\u2019s dancing and wearing those clothes? And why do you feel like you can decide for Danny that those things are an issue when he obviously doesn\u2019t care. \n\nIt was probably for the best you left, if someone called my partner disgusting in MY HOME I wouldn\u2019t let them come back either. \n\nNow for my opinion. You sounds jealous, are you sure you don\u2019t just feel this way because you want Danny\u2019s attention?", "I\u2019m amazed at your psychic powers.

People adapt and change for the people they love - partners, family, friends. You learn to love doing things they love doing, and you learn how it works for you.", "This is slightly off topic but it is pretty bizarre that we call that 'slut shaming' because like.... bruh, why are we calling her a slut? \n\nLike people are out here like \"DONT SHAME HER FOR BEING A SLUT\" \n\n- okay, but have we considered the possibility that she's not a slut, regardless of how okay it is to be one?", "Exactomundo.

I'm an introvert who has had very extroverted friends or past partners. I love seeing people I care about be happy. I love that they can be wild or sexy or just fucking excited about life. I love being part of it and getting to embody that energy for a while. And yes, often when we go out, I'll hit a wall at some point and get exhausted. But it's SO important to me that my friends know that I still love spending time, seeing them happy and want them to live their best life.\n\nIf someone tried to take a jab at the excited people I love by saying I'm misserable after I had told her I was fine TWICE... were having a long fucking talk if I decide to stay friends at all.", "I had a girl like that for a while, they can really sabotage you. Showing more interest when you're taken, less when you are available. Giving you just enough to keep you around.

Danny said it didn't bother him then sat with a moody face.\n\nOP is sure that Danny's uncomfortable because he's thinking about her comment and angry about Lucy, but it's just as likely he uncomfortable with OP, but would feel guilty leaving her alone when she's clearly not happy to be there. The automatic assumption that if he's uncomfortable it must be because he agrees with me that Lucy's behaving \"disgustingly\" and not that OP talking shit about his girlfriend made him uncomfortable. Also, the assumption that the dancing is \"attention seeking\" and not just dancing for fun and her clothing isn't just for herself is obnoxious and misogynistic and the kind of logic that leads to victim blaming.\n\n(also, I have a friend who always makes me sing that song when we do karaoke. I appreciate the reference)", "she\u2019s either wanting him romantically or like u said afraid of him outgrowing her she said he was an introvert and that is was horrible he was dancing and enjoying himself, if ur happy around ppl u tend to come out ur shell more right? smh i would be happy for him not worried", "\u201cshe\u2019s wearing revealing clothes even though other guys are around\u201d jealousy, probably over not having the self confidence to wear revealing stuff. \n\n- *she wears short skirts I wear t-shirts*\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s extroverted which doesn\u2019t fit in where as he and I are both introverted\u201d screaming pick me\n\n- *she\u2019s cheer captain and I\u2019m on the bleachers*\n\nClassic territorial behavior from a girl who\u2019s into her guy friend. In real life the \u201cyou belong with me\u201d behavior is what\u2019s actually disgusting. I\u2019ve always hoped the fuck out when a guy I was interested had a friend like that, because she typically would stop at nothing to drive a wedge between you.

She may not be romantically jealous but she is jealous, either because she thinks his girlfriend is stealing him away or because she thinks he's becoming less like the friend she knew.", "I never realized how creepy that song is until I heard it played on her concert tour cd back to back with \u201cbetter than revenge\u201d and \u201cspeak now\u201d.

Even if op isn't jealous of Lucy's personality, she obviously still wants something that Lucy has; Danny's attention", "How she writes sounds so much like old punk-rock/pop songs about the other woman being a girly girl and the protagonist wearing band t-shirts. It has such a high pick me energy that reading it made me laugh", "This is a good point, the tone is much more Holden Caufield than Amy March. I'm kind of surprised that OP never calls Lucy phony.", "There are a lot of people that wish they were socially competent but aren't capable of it, so a common coping mechanism is to look down on extroverted behavior, often associating it with impropriety.  \n\nThe whole OP can be interpreted as exactly that, like it's so on the nose it's practically a cliche.  That's what the comments about envy are implying.", "I agree that she doesn't want to be like Lucy, but it seems pretty clear that she's jealous Lucy is with Danny. She thinks Lucy isn't right for Danny because OP's the \"respectable\" choice (in her own mind).\n\nWhat she probably doesn't realize is that Danny enjoys that Lucy doesn't have a superiority complex and isn't constantly shitting on everyone around her to feel better about herself.", "I agree that she doesn't want to be like Lucy, but it seems pretty clear that she's jealous Lucy is with Danny.

I thought OP was being an asshole because Danny IS capable of thinking for himself. He can let his own girlfriend know if her outfit makes him uncomfortable.

Different boundaries with different people!\n\nAnd can you also imagine that someone may like to dance with their SO or some extroverts if the opportunity arises as opposed to not dancing around their introverted friends who aren\u2019t dancing!??
