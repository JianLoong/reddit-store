They had a housewarming party on Friday and Lucy spent most of the night dancing with her own friends who are very like her (excitable extroverted e.g) and dragging Danny away from his conversations with us (his friends) to dance even though he's more like us (introverted not party animals)\n\nLater Danny was being quiet so I asked if he was okay and he said just tired, but he just kept watching Lucy dancing and then said something in her ear the next time she came over and she just shook her head and laughed at him. After she went back to her friends I asked if it was bothering him how she was behaving and he asked me to explain. I mentioned the attention seeking dancing and the fact she was wearing something really revealing even though other guys were at this party. Danny said it didn't bother him then sat with a moody face.\n\nAt the end of the night Lucy sat down with us and started chatting non stop about how amazing the party had been. I pointed out jokingly Danny obviously wasn't enjoying himself since he looked miserable, and Danny told her I was worried he was jealous because of her outfit. Lucy ruffled his hair (which he hates) and said he was quiet because he loved her outfit so much he couldn't wait for us all to leave so he could \"drag\" her to bed. I thought that was completely inappropriate and said to Danny in that case I'd leave if she was just going to be disgusting and Lucy just laughed at me so I did leave.\n\nToday Danny has messaged me saying Lucy wants an apology before I'm allowed back at their home but when I asked if Lucy will apologize for making me uncomfortable he said no she doesn't have anything to be sorry about.\n\nI was genuinely only worried about my friend but admit I could have just left without calling her disgusting so AITA?\n\nETA - to clarify I didn't say the comment about her clothes directly to Lucy, I asked Danny once then never mentioned it again. I asked him because I know in the past he's said anything overly sexual makes him uncomfortable. He's not the kind of guy who makes innuendos or anything\nAlso I'm in no way jealous of Lucy, she's the opposite of how I'd want to be (which is fine people can be who they want) and Danny and I already tried dating years ago but the spark wasn't there and it was uncomfortable after we tried being intimate and we BOTH agreed we were better as completely platonic friends", "created_utc": 1682899838, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1347bo7/aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_his_gf_is/", "score": 1481, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And mysogynistic.\n\nWomen can wear whatever they want - even if *gasp* other men are around.\n\nCouples throwing a house party EXPECT each other to interact with the other's friends. \n\nSex is not disgusting. She didn't go into detail - she just didn't let you slut shame her.", "YTA. You sound jealous lol", "YTA and a jealous one at that.\n\nEdit to add: Danny was uncomfortable because of the way you were acting.", "YTA. It\u2019s his relationship, not yours. Just because something is bothering you doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bothering him. Commenting on whether he was OK with her wardrobe makes you look controlling - because it is.

You would absolutely hate the parties I go to lol", "YTA\n\nYou're jealous and you think you know this guy so well that you can speak for him. You are losing him to his gf and his life and you're scared.\n\nPerhaps you don't understand other women because you should know we don't wear certain clothes or enjoy dancing to turn anyone else on.

What on earth would make you think you have a single ounce of authority over this woman's behavior or choice of clothing?

All that checks out. \n\nBut just because you are also an introvert doesn't mean you and Danny have the exact feelings. He never mentioned her outfit or dancing, YOU did. He only mentioned being tired then watching his partner dance, which, as an introvert I can agree dancing drains me and I'd rather watch my partner have fun. \n\nStop projecting, take a step back, and maybe, idk, talk to your friend and figure out how he Actually feels about things instead of guessing/projecting....Also decide if this is worth not going over to your friends house anymore or if you can such it up and get over the fact you jus", "yta girls that hate other girls are scary", "YTA big time.", "YTA.

It can be hard when friends find a SO, and harder still when they move in together, and friends (of any gender!) can feel like they\u2019re being replaced by the romantic partner. The challenge is that the way you\u2019re acting will only drive more of a wedge between you and Danny.

They had a housewarming party on Friday and Lucy spent most of the night dancing with her own friends who are very like her (excitable extroverted e.g) and dragging Danny away from his conversations with us (his friends) to dance even though he's more like us (introverted not party animals)\n\nLater Danny was being quiet so I asked if he was okay and he said just tired, but he just kept watching Lucy dancing and then said something in her ear the next time she came over and she just shook her head and laughed at him. After she went back to her friends I asked if it was bothering him how she was behaving and he asked me to explain. I mentioned the attention seeking dancing and the fact she was wearing something really revealing even though other guys were at this party. Danny said it didn't bother him then sat with a moody face.\n\nAt the end of the night Lucy sat down with us and started chatting non stop about how amazing the party had been. I pointed out jokingly Danny obviously wasn't enjoying himself since he looked miserable, and Danny told her I was worried he was jealous because of her outfit. Lucy ruffled his hair (which he hates) and said he was quiet because he loved her outfit so much he couldn't wait for us all to leave so he could \"drag\" her to bed. I thought that was completely inappropriate and said to Danny in that case I'd leave if she was just going to be disgusting and Lucy just laughed at me so I did leave.\n\nToday Danny has messaged me saying Lucy wants an apology before I'm allowed back at their home but when I asked if Lucy will apologize for making me uncomfortable he said no she doesn't have anything to be sorry about.\n\nI was genuinely only worried about my friend but admit I could have just left without calling her disgusting so AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I would love to hang out with her. You sound like a slut shaming sourpuss", "YTA. Jealous much?   You were upset that his girlfriend wanted yo dance with him.  Then when, you made a comment about the way she was dressed he had a pissed off look on his face. You were trying to cause trouble between them. Like really.

And when it didn\u2019t work with him he tried it with her. \n\nYou owe both of them an apology for the things you said and the way you acted.", "YTA. Your first clue that you were gonna be the AH here was when Danny didn\u2019t even know what you were talking about when you asked him if he was upset with her behavior. \n\nOP, you are way too young for this pearl-clutching nonsense. You remind me of the nuns in Catholic school. If you want to keep your friend, you\u2019ll apologize to Lucy for insulting her for having a good time in her own home. She, on the other hand, owes you nothing.", "YTA. For judging and insulting someone doing nothing more than enjoying herself at a party in her own home with her friends.

YTA for several reasons: assuming you know better about your friend\u2019s relationship than he does, thinking you have the right to police his girlfriend\u2019s clothing and behavior, being flat out rude to both of them, and doubling down when called on your behavior. If you think a woman\u2019s clothing or dancing is attention seeking, guess what? You can choose not to pay attention to it. Wearing a certain thing or dancing a certain way is not an open invitation to be treated poorly.\n\nEdit: I absolutely thought this whole post was written by a man, and now I think it\u2019s even worse that it isn\u2019t.

Why do you care if she\u2019s dancing and wearing those clothes? And why do you feel like you can decide for Danny that those things are an issue when he obviously doesn\u2019t care. \n\nIt was probably for the best you left, if someone called my partner disgusting in MY HOME I wouldn\u2019t let them come back either. \n\nNow for my opinion. You sounds jealous, are you sure you don\u2019t just feel this way because you want Danny\u2019s attention?", "I\u2019m amazed at your psychic powers.

Why put your negative thoughts in your friends head? I don\u2019t see how you can see yourself as a good friend with how you acted. You sound very judgmental and jealous.", "\u201cAITA for being an AH?\u201d\n\nYes btw. Yes you are.", "YTA. You're clearly jealous of Lucy. Danny should cut you out of his life with that attitude and disrespect to his significant other. It's her fucking home and she can wear what ever the fuck she wants, you don't need to be there. Oh and when people are in a relationship it's \"our\" friends, you clearly need some maturing to do.", "YTA.\n\nPeople change drastically even more so after high school. Why in the world would you criticize what the host is wearing? It's her home not yours, she can invite whomever she wants. If you didn't like the vibe, you should've just left...  Like others mentioned, sex is not disgusting, they're a couple, what do you think couples do? You obviously don't know what's going on in their relationship. OP you need to apologize to his gf or you will forever lose a friend.", "YTA. You\u2019re one of those \u201cnot like other girls\u201d types, aren\u2019t you?  Not a good look.", "YTA and you may deny it but i definitely get jealousy vibes here. I dont particularly like women who dress with it all hanging out, but its not my body and I wouldnt want to dictate what they wear. This is also a womans perspective \n\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I dress like a fucking librarian. Kinda wish I could feel comfortable with v neck tops or short skirts, but I dont. So its cardigan/ legging life for me \ud83d\ude02", "YTA - it\u2019s perfectly normal (and common!) for people in a relationship to have a split attitude when it comes to dancing / being extroverted. In fact most happy couples I know are like this. \n\nAlso, revealing clothing? Have you been on Instagram? Virtually all people have at least one photo posted of them in a swimsuit. If she wasn\u2019t in her underwear, I doubt it was all that revealing.", "Holy shit is this a real story or did someone write a VERY On The Nose story about a pick me girl \n\nJust in case you\u2019re a real person uh YTA", "He honestly needs to let you go as a friend, if I'm being honest. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f stop thinking you know him better than her. You're JUST A FRIEND when she's not. Get in check. You need to grow up.", "giving major pick me, choose me, love me vibes. YTA. be a better friend and maybe help him feel better instead making him dwell into something more? Plus things change when two people are in a relationship, like he might like that his partner likes his hair and also likes to ruffle it, he lets her have it. You gotta chill out.", " YTA and you sound like an incel. She can dress and dance however and wherever and in front of whomever she likes.", "YTA.\n\nOP, if Danny and Lucy are happy with their relationship (playful touches and innuendos included) then that\u2019s for them to enjoy. If they are not, then that\u2019s still not for you to referee. Danny didn\u2019t ask you to help. You need to take many steps back here.\n\nYou do indeed owe Lucy an apology if you expect to be invited back, though. You called her disgusting. If one of my partner\u2019s friends had called me disgusting, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want to be around them in my living space.\n\nEdit: revisions", "Yta you sound jealous that a girl opposite of you makes him happy and he\u2019s loving it", "\u201cShe\u2019s the opposite of how I\u2019d want to be (which is fine people can be who they want\u201d\n\nProceeds to complain about the someone else is.\n\nYTA. The fact that you\u2019re a fellow woman makes this even worse. This woman allowed you in HER home, where she can act however she wants. You\u2019re clearly a jealous, bitter person (deny it all you want).", "YTA - mainly because their relationship is non of your business.    \nDid anyone ask your opinion about Lucy?  No?  Then keep it to yourself.   \nIt would be different if your friend approached you and asked.  It would also be different if you said something about yourself - and the fact that YOU felt uncomfortable.  Voicing your uncalled for opinions about others is always AH material.", "INFO: exactly what is she \u201csupposed\u201d to wear now that she\u2019s in a relationship?", "If you have feelings for him, just tell.", "YTA and I can\u2019t believe this was written by a girl. NOT a girls girl. Gross pick me behavior. He doesn\u2019t want you, he wants his gf and she can dress how she wants regardless of how either of you feel about it. You\u2019re disgusting", "YTA it sounds like you're in love with Danny. I think you should stop being friends with him because it's clear you don't care about his best interest. Lucy... danced and * checks notes* wore clothes she was comfortable in. Then these grown adults in a relationship so serious they moved in together made a joke that they're gonna have sex and you think you're owed an apology for that? Honey I don't know if you've been in the world lately but sex is everywhere. Get over yourself", "YTA I think you\u2019re secretly in love with your friend", "YTA. Pick me vibes are strong in this one", "YTA. I can't believe a woman wrote this. How is the way she dresses any of your business? Why did you have to make that comment. If your friend is uncomfortable, he will tell her when no one is there and even if she did, she can dress however the fuck she wants. Mind your own business. If your friend has trouble in his relationship, he can tell you on his own, no need to dig for some.", "YTA. Totally.  You sound awful, judgmental, and jealous.", "YTA. The \u201cpick me girl\u201d vibes are so loud.\nYou definitely owe Lucy an apology.", "YTA - this means that you were in the wrong. You sound like you have feelings for Danny and about your relationship and his with his new GF that you need to reflect on and get in tune with. You don't sound like you know what you're talking about when you refer to your history together or that evening at the party. There is nothing wrong with any of the way she was acting and it's not as if Danny is with her involuntarily. What you said about her was rude and prudish and although you're allowed to ask what's bothering your friend, it is NOT your place to pry or assume and then work off of those assumptions. That is a serious dick move.", "She dances with her friends in her own house! *clutches pearls*", "She wants the dude but it \u201cdidn\u2019t work out\u201d when they tried dating in the past. Makes a lot more sense when you get to that part.", "Right?? She even said how the girlfriend was dancing with her friends who are all extroverts. They were all just having fun", "I bet OP thinks \"she's not like other women\". Don't be the girl who shit talks other chicks as a way to get in with the dudes.", "OP sounds like the type of introvert who divides the world into \"us vs them.\"", "Or admit that she wants to keep him to herself even if not romantically involved. This sounds like a classic \u201cI don\u2019t want him but I don\u2019t want anyone else to have him either\u201d scenario YTA OP", "the lore abt this in the reddit replies is going crazy", "Was looking for this comment. Danny was looking miserable and upset because OP spent all night scoffing at and belittling his girlfriend in their own home. Nasty and no self awareness.", "THIS. It's not your place to correct her behavior. And even if her outfit did bother him because he's jealous then that's something HE needs to work through on his own. You don't get to control your partner's clothing choices just because you're insecure. Women can wear whatever they want- get over it.", "also, it sounds like she is making a lot of assumptions. She kept saying \"he looked miserable\" \"he wasn't having fun\" and \"he doesn't like these things\" except every time she asked him he went, \"what? I'm fine!\" I'd be willing to bet he didn't look half as miserable as she thinks. And I'm guessing Op wasn't as subtle about her dislike as she thinks she was.\n\nWhether she likes him romantically or just doesn't like the idea of a good friend turning into someone else and potentially outgrowing her, the point remains the same. She needs to but out. If he's miserable he'll figure it out, even if the GF is secretly a sluttysaurus rex and treats him like crap that isn't her problem or place to make any comments.\n\nAnd most importantly; just because people live their lives differently than yours doesn't mean it's wrong. There is nothing wrong with being an introvert or prude, just like there is nothing wrong with being an extrovert that likes short skirts and long jackets.", "OP go look up Internalized misogyny, please. You slut shamed her and acted like you could read Danny\u2019s mind. What\u2019s disgusting is you\u2019re writing this and trying to pretend you don\u2019t sound jealous. Apologize to her. YTA.", "Couldn't have said it better than this \n\nOp, YTA, and you should apologize", "100 percent this. I'd cut off anyone who tried to shame my SO for having the confidence to wear what made her feel good and have fun while hosting a party.  In fact, those are the moments when I'm extra in love with her.", "The \u201cNot Like the Other Girls\u201d energy is strong with this one. YTA", "agreed. not that it matters what she chooses to wear & when, but if it was a house party, it meant everyone there was a friend of theirs. therefore she\u2019s in her own home with people she knows, so literally why should it matter what she wears!! yta", "Women can most definitely wear whatever they want IN THEIR OWN FECKING HOUSE!!!!\n\nYTA, OP. If you are uncomfortable, you should feel free to vote with your feet.", "Opposites really do attract.  We can\u2019t both be talking our asses off, it would be too over the top.  We can\u2019t both be shy and reserved or we\u2019d miss out on experiences. Lucy was bringing shy Danny out of his shell and onto the dance floor. \n\nOP you made Danny uncomfortable and ruined the housewarming party for him. YTA", "!!!!", "A great reminder from OP that not all incels are guys", "I wonder if OP is actually a guy and just wrote it as a girl in the hopes we wouldn't realize it was incel nonsense?", "Omfg, I had to go back to check OP\u2019s gender after you said \u201cinternalized misogyny\u201d because I assumed this had to be coming from a man\u2026ick", "She wears pretty things she likes around her fun friends! *gasp*  \n\nShe tussles her live-in boyfriend's hair! *falls backward in chair*", "what blasphemy! how dare she have fun and talk To her boyfriend!", "Holy crap.  I missed that OP is a girl.  Sounded like a guy with the crap she was posting.", "FRL she was minding her business having the time of her life n OP had the audacity to call her disgusting for what? Being extroverted? Dancing? Wearing clothes? Wanting to have sex with HER boyfriend? Like gd", "real, like unless you have a valid reason don't just shit on your friend's partner for no reason. It's hella shady", "Well he did whisper \"Please save me\" into her ear, but she only shook her head and laughed.", "Yea throughout my entire last relationship I would t even let my family talk about my partner like that to my face, if someone did it as a guest they\u2019d have been asked to leave", "He was probably uncomfortable because of OP being so judgmental about his girlfriend", "For some reason I can't quite explain, the song \"You Belong With Me\" by Taylor Swift started playing in my head after I'd read half of the first paragraph. \n \nIt's fine to be concerned about a friend, but there are better places and times than in the middle of a party at the friend's house to express that concern... YTA", "OP even added on how she isn't jealous and how they tried dating but didn't work out\n\nIt might be that she wouldn't call what she is feeling jealousy, but she sure still feel like she has some ownership over him\n\nShe doesn't like him, but he can't like anyone else. Other women are slutty and don't know he hates it when they mess with his hair", "The comment about the hair being ruffled, which he hates, was also stupid. I would hate it if someone just ruffled my hair but if it was my boyfriend, I'd be okay with it I love when my boyfriend touches my hair. Op you sound jealous, you sound like a misogynist and from my own personal experience with dating people with friends like you, you sound paranoid that your friend is going to leave you completely for his girlfriend. Let him enjoy his relationship and go get your own, Friends like you are the worst\n\nEdited to add a verdict, OP YTA", "I missed the self declared gender and thought this was written by a dude. Come to think of it, it probably was.", "no wonder this story felt like millenial seinfeld", "This. I hate anyone touching me physically at all, but when me and my ex were together, I went from quietly saying I love you into the phone because for some reason it made me uncomfortable to say around other strangers, to literally holding her hand every chance I could in public", "She just relates to guys better because girls are so dramatic and catty, ok?", "See edit, she\u2019s like this cuz he didn\u2019t pick her, rip", "Alexa play You Belong with Me by Taylor Swift", "I thought this was 100% an incel guy until I got to the comments", "She said she wants to have sex with her boyfriend! *faints*", "me too, was super confused at the bottom and had to go back and check OP\u2019s gender because I thought she was a dude.", "This is exactly what I thought. He just doesn't want OP touching him", "I bet Lucy wears short skirts and OP wears T-shirts and Lucy is cheer captain and OP's on the bleachers. \n\nLol it was literally the first thing that came into my head.\n\nAlso you just ask \"what's wrong?\" if something doesn't feel right- not try and incept them with the idea that their misery is because of their SO is ruffling their hair.\n\nEdit: also can't believe none of OPs friends called out their behaviour for this.", "Exact same here. Started humming it to myself while reading this.", "I\u2019d be willing to bet he only hates it when op messes with his hair.", "It's not jealousy.  It's clearly envy.\n\nOP is envious of how Danny has found someone who makes him happy, she wasn't able to make him happy, and she doesn't have a partner that makes her happy.", "Same here.  It was only when I got to the comments that I realized it's a she.  Maybe.", "Noooo she just is aware of the fact that Danny wouldn\u2019t like a girl like the one he is dating and moved in with. He only likes girls like OP, who he dated and decided he wasn\u2019t into.", "No One Understands Him as She Does!", "Apparently not in the bedroom.", "That\u2019s how I took it, too! Haha! OP here needs to take *a lot* of hints that \u201cDanny\u201d *doesn\u2019t want to fuck her*.", "He probably also doesn't like innuendo around/with OP", "Yup. Lucy is getting the treatment/life that OP wanted at one point, only for it to just not work out. The fact that she stated that they tried being intimate at one point after, only agree on staying strictly platonic due to it being \u201cawkward\u201d, more than likely means one of them still had feelings.", "Probably doesn't like the sight of OP in revealing clothes either XD", "Yeah, and she writes:\n\n>Danny and I already tried dating years ago but the spark wasn't there and it was uncomfortable after we tried being intimate....\n\nProbably uncomfortable and awkward for OP because OP was a boring prude, and Lucy is the fun & sexually comfortable partner that Danny was looking for, and has now found.  Danny realized that OP was not the type of partner he was in search of."]}
