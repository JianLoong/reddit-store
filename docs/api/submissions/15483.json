It was heart breaking but my mom can't really divorce my dad because she's been a SAH mom for years and she's already old and can't really find a job anymore.\n\nI'm 23, and have only been working for almost 3 months now. I didn't finished college due to falling in depression after the revelation of the affair, but no one can help me, my mom has her own problem and I don't want to be financially rely on my cheating father anymore, besides I'm an adult now. And as an adult, I suck it up and tried to get out of my depression as I look for a job.\n\nOnto the topic, dad pays a visit a few days ago. For some reason. My mom still loves him despite all of that so she welcomes him. I work 7am to 4pm, 5 days a week. But since I don't want to engage with that man, I didn't come home till 8 in the evening. I didn't talk to him much. He never said sorry or anything and tries to make simple conversation or asking how was my life.\n\nThis man have been on and off of my life since I was 12 so yeah. I don't really have a bond with him. 9 pm, he left but he gave us a few cash (he haven't given anything to us for a year), saying he'll visit again. After he left and me and my mom ate dinner, I stayed in my room to rest and play with my phone, that's when I notice I had a few miscalls from someone. I don't recognize the number so I ignored it.\n\n2 hours passed and I receive another call from the same number. I don't really give out my phone number tbh. And because of the scams that's going on I never really answer calls from unknown number except if I'm expecting a call from someone.\n\nAs expected, I dropped the call and went about my night.\n\nMorning came, I check FB for any messages from friends that's when I found a message from 'That woman' berating me from not answering my phone.\n\nMy dad doesn't really have a phone so no one can really contact him when he goes out, except when he borrows phone from his colleagues. \n\nSo the woman had been calling me to reach out to my dad who she knew went to visit us. She was calling me because her son got into an accident and they needed him for help. But since I've been ignoring calls the boy didn't get treated early because they don't have money to pay for an uber or to the hospital. I don't really care about her, but I'm not a cold hearted to not feel sorry for the kid. I don't accept him as a brother but I don't blame him either.\n\nI feel so guilty for ignoring the calls. If only I answered the phone I could've sent my dad early especially I know that he's not coming back on his apartment when he mentioned he's going out for drinks with his friends.\n\nAITA for not answering the phone call.\n\nI haven't told this to my mom and can't reach out my dad or his friend because I don't know which friend he's with and I don't have any contact info of his friends.\n\nEdit for update:\n Thank you so much for those who replied that I should not feel guilty for not answering her phone calls. I'll talk to my dad about this the next time he visits. I already block her number and her fb because I have no responsibility on her. I don't know the names of her other kids so I can't block them but if they did, I'll just block them.\n\n\nI want to clarify something about why I don't immediately answer my phone calls and my job status because I read a heated argument here.\n\nI started job hunting on November, got hired and start training on December to January. I start actually working on February and my job forbid us to use our phones so it was always on my locker. I also don't use them when I commute because I'm afraid it'll get stolen so I only use them at home.\n\nVoicemails isn't really that familiar concept here on my country so people rarely left one when a call didn't get answred but I do agree that she should've just message me in the first place or not message me at all. It's not my problem, I shouldn't be the one dealing with this in the first place.\n\nAgain, thank you for the nice people here who had replied and gave advise.\n\nI do need therapy.", "created_utc": 1682239550, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12w1nsu/aita_for_ignoring_the_calls_from_my_dads_mistress/", "score": 331, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If I lose my phone and I have to contact my partner because I'm locked out of my apartment, or I got into an accident and I'm being taken to hospital, I sure hope he answers even if it's an unknown number.\n\nPlus, if an unknown number is calling you repeatedly in the span of a few minutes, it's probably not a spam call and you probably do need to answer. \n\nAnd if OP has been job hunting lately like they said, it's even more important to answer unknown calls.

Some people have anxiety, some people don\u2019t trust unknown numbers, and some simply don\u2019t want to - in no way does that make them a worse adult.", "But it sounds like all she did was call repeatedly without once leaving a voicemail or trying to text.

She was pissed off that your dad is visiting your mother and was trying to control him.", "Not everywhere. In the US and a bunch of the West, sure.  We don't know where OP is.", "Yup. She was bringing the drama!  \n\nThe kid is fine. No emergency! She was just showing her husband what she can & will do when he ignores her. \n\nI hope OP sees your comment (and a few others) pointing out for her to block and not get caught up in their ridiculous drama!\n\nThe man is a real piece of work.", ">What if it was someone else that would contact OP in an emergency\n\nThen they live a voice mail or a message.", "You\u2019re welcome \u263a\ufe0f.", "NTA. \n\nI don\u2019t believe her story for a second, and neither should you.", "NTA. Your dad not having a phone is fishy ASF for a guy with two families. Maybe there's another family involved there that no one knows yet.", "NTA. Your dads mistress is a vile creature. She should not even have your number, muchless bother you about her kid.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nYou are not obligated to answer a phone call from an unknown number.\n\nAlso it is not your fault that your father does not have his own phone an chooses to be unreachable in an emergency situation.", "You didn't do a damn thing wrong.  Your dad's issue isn't yours. Your parents Marriage isn't yours either. Take care of you", "NTA.  I don't answer calls from unknown numbers either.  I get a lot of spam calls.  I would have done the same thing you did, and never reply to her messages either.  This is your father's responsibility.", "NTA!  None of this problem is up you're making  And it's nobody's business but your own whether you choose to answer your phone or not.", "Yeah the dad needs to have a phone to be available for his kid. Sounds like a shit dad to both kids.", "Dad doesn't have a cell phone so mistress #1 can't find him at mistress #2's house.", "Super reasonable and still not NTA as long as you didn't actually mistreat the child.", "I agree. She was checking up on him and trying to prevent him from looking fir her replacement. Or maybe he already has one and that's why he won't carry a phone. That lady knows exactly how devious he is and knows that he's doing the same thing to her that he did to his wife.", "Every time there's a thread like this, I always wonder exactly what sort of emergencies we're all supposed to be available 24/7 to respond to.  Unless you have kids, there are very few scenarios where your immediate presence is going to make much real difference.\n\nYou can certainly find *some* (that other poster is working really hard to invent them lol), but they're few and far between.  I'm for sure not going to answer the dozens of spam calls I get every week just because there's a one in a million chance one of them might be a stranger calling me about an emergency and can't/won't leave a message."]}
