It was heart breaking but my mom can't really divorce my dad because she's been a SAH mom for years and she's already old and can't really find a job anymore.\n\nI'm 23, and have only been working for almost 3 months now. I didn't finished college due to falling in depression after the revelation of the affair, but no one can help me, my mom has her own problem and I don't want to be financially rely on my cheating father anymore, besides I'm an adult now. And as an adult, I suck it up and tried to get out of my depression as I look for a job.\n\nOnto the topic, dad pays a visit a few days ago. For some reason. My mom still loves him despite all of that so she welcomes him. I work 7am to 4pm, 5 days a week. But since I don't want to engage with that man, I didn't come home till 8 in the evening. I didn't talk to him much. He never said sorry or anything and tries to make simple conversation or asking how was my life.\n\nThis man have been on and off of my life since I was 12 so yeah. I don't really have a bond with him. 9 pm, he left but he gave us a few cash (he haven't given anything to us for a year), saying he'll visit again. After he left and me and my mom ate dinner, I stayed in my room to rest and play with my phone, that's when I notice I had a few miscalls from someone. I don't recognize the number so I ignored it.\n\n2 hours passed and I receive another call from the same number. I don't really give out my phone number tbh. And because of the scams that's going on I never really answer calls from unknown number except if I'm expecting a call from someone.\n\nAs expected, I dropped the call and went about my night.\n\nMorning came, I check FB for any messages from friends that's when I found a message from 'That woman' berating me from not answering my phone.\n\nMy dad doesn't really have a phone so no one can really contact him when he goes out, except when he borrows phone from his colleagues. \n\nSo the woman had been calling me to reach out to my dad who she knew went to visit us. She was calling me because her son got into an accident and they needed him for help. But since I've been ignoring calls the boy didn't get treated early because they don't have money to pay for an uber or to the hospital. I don't really care about her, but I'm not a cold hearted to not feel sorry for the kid. I don't accept him as a brother but I don't blame him either.\n\nI feel so guilty for ignoring the calls. If only I answered the phone I could've sent my dad early especially I know that he's not coming back on his apartment when he mentioned he's going out for drinks with his friends.\n\nAITA for not answering the phone call.\n\nI haven't told this to my mom and can't reach out my dad or his friend because I don't know which friend he's with and I don't have any contact info of his friends.", "created_utc": 1682239550, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12w1nsu/aita_for_ignoring_the_calls_from_my_dads_mistress/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You didn't know. You're not obliged to answer your phone, particularly if it's an unknown number. I don't. Your dad should have asked if it was ok to share your phone number with her, then you would have known who was calling. And she could have texted explaining the situation when you didn't answer. \n\nThis whole situation was caused by the fact that your dad chooses not to have a phone, which makes it harder for people to contact him. This is on him.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t ignore calls from her, you ignored calls from an unknown number for reasons you explained very well.\n\nIt does sound like you\u2019re holding onto a lot of pain and anger right now though. Have you talked through this with anyone?", "NTA, you didn\u2019t know it was her, you didn\u2019t know the circumstances. Besides, it\u2019s your dad\u2019s responsibility to tend to them, not yours.", "NTA for not answering your phone.\n\nThe kid is also NTA, they didn't ask to be born into this shit show.  Ultimately though they are not your responsibility and you had no reason to know that phone call was about that child being injured.\n\nI feel for the child, but that child being without support makes your dad an ass not you", "NTA. You are not obligated to pick up your phone to unknown numbers and you are not your dad's personal assistant. She should be pissed at *him* for being an irresponsible parent by not being reachable in an emergency.\n\nAlso, I smell a rat with her. If it was such an emergency, and you weren't answering... why didn't she send a message (SMS or FB) explaining it was her calling and why? Did she call your mother?\n\nEdit: clarity", "NTA. You are never obligated to pick up the phone nor do you owe anyone a conversation. Furthermore you ignored phone calls from an unknown number. Most people ignore no caller ID\u2019s.", "NTA. If she'd had any sense she'd have texted/left a voicemai explaining it was an emergency. Tbh your dad shouldn't have given her your number without checking you were ok with this first.", "NTA - you are not your dad's secretary and there's no reason at all why you should feel obligated to answer her calls. \n\nThis is their problem not yours. Your dad needs to get a phone of his own, or they need to work something else out on their own. You own neither of them anything. \n\nSadly that 12 year old is just another victim here.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I feel so guilty for ignoring the calls\" .. Why? None of this is YOUR fault. Your dad DOES NOT WANT TO BE REACHED BY HER, respect his decission.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf your dad wanted her to be able to reach him, he would have a phone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**You did NOTHING wrong,** do not let them draw you into their relationship drama.", "NTA at all. A competent adult would\u2019ve been able to get the kid to the hospital if his injuries required it, call a friend, family member, neighbor, etc. Worst case scenario, ambulances are a thing and they don\u2019t charge upfront (Yes they\u2019re way more expensive than they should be, but parenthood comes with surprise expenses).", "NTA you aren\u2019t to go between for you dad and his mistress. First question is htf she get your phone number? If you have you number listed on Facebook remove it..And message her back never contact you again for any reason before you block her on Facebook and on your phone..\nMistress has alot of nerve you don\u2019t owe her a explanation about a damn thing and it\u2019s not your fault she can\u2019t afford a damn uber.. she should have called an ambulance if her child was hurt.", ">she's already old \n\nGoing with YTA just for this, you whippersnapper", "I think the main problem here is not answering your phone. If you see the same number calling repeatedly you should always answer.

You don\u2019t owe that  mistress anything.", "Also... if that woman doesnt have any money to call an uber.. what is dad doing? Uber costs way less than $50 and she doesnt even have that??

Id say shes exagerating.", "No. But I did shared my circumstance to a friend, she 's no expert but she's nice to listen on me ranting, and I did feel good after that.\n\n\nBut I know I need to address this soon.", "Thank you.\nTbh. I did hate the kid the first time, but because of some silly reason not about being born.

I just hope he's okay now.", "My mother have an FB but its under an alias cuz I don't want drama. I have my FB on my full name for work purposes so that's why it's easy to find me.", "Yeah. I think so too. I don't want to change phone number tho. Is it okay just to block her number?", "Yeah. Poor kid. I'm not sure he knows our circumstances and I didn't reach out to him. He did have older siblings tho. I'm an only child so I don't know how to feel to have a half brother or possible siblings.", "It just dawn on me. The woman has older kids, they could've help. I don't know how old are they but I'm sure they have friends that they can contact.", "My contact info on facebook is private so I know she didn't got it there. Prolly from my dad, but I know even if he's a jerk he won't just give it to her, she probably searched his things and got my contact no.\n\nI already block her on fb. I didn't message her back cuz I don't want any convo exchange with that woman.", "Lol!", "Then the dad could have a phone, why are they obligated to take any phone calls from unknown numbers?", "They could've left a voice mail. Or sent a text.", "no one is ever under any obligation to answer their phone for any reason.  Doesn't matter if its repeated calls or not.\n\nIf it was that urgent they could have either left a message or texted.", "I hope someone figures out your phone number so we can all start calling you and teach you about real life responsibility \ud83d\ude44", "That\u2019s great. Trained professionals can be incredibly effective but having good friends to talk to really helps.", "That's what you do when you're an adult with adult responsibilities.\n\nPeople can lose their phones, or they can get stolen or destroyed, or the battery could be dead, especially in emergency situations. Or if someone's unconscious or dead and their phone is locked of course people are gonna use their own phone to contact you. If I lose my phone and I have to contact my partner because I'm locked out of my apartment, or I got into an accident and I'm being taken to hospital, I sure hope he answers even if it's an unknown number.\n\nPlus, if an unknown number is calling you repeatedly in the span of a few minutes, it's probably not a spam call and you probably do need to answer. \n\nAnd if OP has been job hunting lately like they said, it's even more important to answer unknown calls. When you're job hunting and sending out your CV, people will call you on your cell phone to discuss interviews etc. If you don't answer your phone because it's an unknown number they'll just cross you off their list and move on and someone else who answered their phone will get the job", "no one is ever under any obligation to answer their phone for any reason\n\nLol okay, are you 12? Try not answering your phone when you have an employer, or a partner, or a child, or an elderly parent that might need help or be in an emergency or a car that might be getting towed, or possessions that might get stolen and found, or neighbors that might want to contact you to let you know your house is being broken into, or potential employers trying to set up an interview, the list goes on. See how long it takes before people start calling you unreliable and dropping you as soon as they can", "Thats not a requirement of being an adult \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 who are you the adult police? \n\nThis man hasnt been there throughout their life, so why are they responsible for him? \n\nAnd it still can definitely be spam if they call several time. \n\nJust because you always answer your phone the second it rings doesnt mean 100% of all other adults do. Some people have anxiety, some people don\u2019t trust unknown numbers, and some simply don\u2019t want to - in no way does that make them a worse adult.", "But it sounds like all she did was call repeatedly without once leaving a voicemail or trying to text.  If Plan A wasn't working she needed a Plan B.", "Well, yes it does. It's part of being responsible for all the reasons I listed.\n\nAnd I didn't say I answer my phone the second it rings. But when an unknown number is calling you repeatedly you should probably answer it. \n\nWhat if it was someone else that would contact OP in an emergency, like a partner or a close friend or a relative? What if someone had stolen something from them and it had been found? And again, they've been job hunting. Not answering unknown calls when you're job hunting is just plain stupid.", "That still doesn't change the fact that it's an irresponsible habit to never answer unknown numbers no matter how many times they call, which is my original point.", "Op is not their dads parent, they have no obligation to take calls for him. He can get a phone for that", "Also no one mentioned job hunting in this post, you\u2019re just reaching at this point cause you\u2019re wrong", "What job is calling at 9pm?! No job I'd want to work, that's for sure! You know who calls multiple times at unsociable hours? Spam bot callers.\n\nMy mantra has always been \"if it's important, they'll leave a message\". That has never failed me because normal people don't feel an entitlement to have all of their calls answered!", "No it isn't.", "I did not mention their father at any point. I said it could have been their father having a medical emergency but it could just as well had been some other emergency. Hell, it could have been their car getting towed or their employer letting them know a change in their work schedule for the next day. \n\nI'm saying it's an irresponsible habit to not answer your phone when it's an unknown numbers, for all the reasons I listed.", "OP said they've only been working for three months and have been looking for a job since dropping out of college. That's what job hunting means", "A job where you need to be in at 7am the next day? At what time are they gonna call to let you know you're not going in, or they're changing your shift, if not then?\n\nI hope your partner or your kids or your elderly parents or whoever else might call you in an emergency know you won't be there for them unless they leave a message lol.", "Yeah, it is.", "Op also states they are working, and the father left at 9 pm, why would a place of work call at that hour to offer a potition", "> A job where you need to be in at 7am the next day?\n\nSo a job you're already in and should already *know* the relevant phone numbers that would be calling? And NONE of my superiors know how to send a message or leave a voicemail?\n\n> I hope your partner or your kids or your elderly parents or whoever else might call you in an emergency know you won't be there for them unless they leave a message\n\nAgain, all numbers i would *know*.\n\nYou're not backing up your points at all here.", "If someone needs to get hold of me that badly they can leave a message or send a text,it's not difficult. My phone is for my convenience. No one else's.", "Which is why I said it's irresponsible in general to not answer call and not just at this specific time\n\nPlease try to keep up man", "Again, in an emergency people will lose their phones, or they can get stolen or destroyed or the battery could be dead.\n\nIf I get into a bad car accident and I'm getting taken to hospital, chances are I won't have my phone to call people afterwards, unless it was on my person (unlikely). \n\nIf my bag gets stolen and I don't have my wallet, my keys or my phone anymore I'm gonna have to use someone else's phone to contact people to get help. \n\nSeriously if you can't imagine not having your phone on you in an emergency and having to use someone else's phone I think you need to get out more", "Clearly your phone is for Twitter Reddit and Tumblr lol. Other people have actual responsibilities and emergencies", "> If I get into a bad car accident\n\n... the hospital is calling from a local land line, which is less of a suspicious call.\n\n> If my bag gets stolen\n\n... that's not an immediate emergency. Borrow a phone and message the person you need. Or go to the police station and use their local land line.\n\n> if you can't imagine not having your phone on you in an emergency and having to use someone else's phone\n\nI have borrowed phones in emergencies but I've always had the decency to let people know it's me by message. I don't assume that **as a potential stranger** I'm entitled to everyone's immediate attention just because they have a phone!!", "so because people don\u2019t answer random ass numbers they\u2019re not being productive on their phone? your logic is wack as fuck. nobody is obligated to answer the phone, i just was job hunting and every place that called me, i didn\u2019t answer but they sure left a voicemail to inform me who it was and they sure werent calling me at 9pm. just because you have no life and can answer the phone for every unknown number doesn\u2019t mean everyone else can.\nedit:word"]}
