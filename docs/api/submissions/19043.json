My FIL has been trying to acquire that land for several years but the owner wouldn\u2019t sell the land. Last year the owner decided to sell the land to my FIL for an incredible price of 60k, basically the reason to get the land was to have family build on it. The land is easily worth more than that and a builder contacted the previous owner and offered 109k to purchase. The land could be estimated somewhere in the 150k range since the market has been crazy. FIL then contacted Me (male 30) and my wife ( female 26 ) and my wife\u2019s sister (23) and her husband (28) and asked if we were interested in buying it and splitting it. I originally wanted to do that exact thing, but my brother in law wanted to buy the entire land and then turn it to flip a profit. My FIL said no and that he wanted someone to build on it that was family. BIL became disinterested and sister in law did not want to purchase the land or even split it. My wife also had another sister (19) and she was not in any position to buy land and was not offered, but seemed disinterested. Once I found out I was the only one wanting to buy it with the intention of living on it, I purchased it which took a lot out of my savings.Not to mention there was other fees associated with buying the land and two years of taxes that needed to be paid. Fast forward to current time, I unfortunately cannot get a loan with a respectable Mortage to build a home, so it\u2019s just sitting. ( I already have a home that is very affordable and after a few years of good saving I\u2019ll be able to build.) Furthermore, all of the sisters are having children and so is my wife this year. So now all of a sudden both sister in laws want me to divide the land evenly and only charge them what I paid for, the 60k and not fair market value. I told them that I do not want to sell the land and even if I did I would sell it at fair market value,  but the more I thought of doing that it would not be fair to profit off of family. So I was very adamant of not wanting to sell. MIL and the sisters are furious now because I \u201cstole\u201d the land and I am crushing the dream of all the family being next door neighbors. I asked my FIL if I wasn\u2019t able to buy it if he would have, and he said yes but then I questioned why he offered it to me and my brother in law in the first place. My wife says we should just spit the land evenly and just charge them what we paid for it but I do not want to do that. We live 35 minutes away from father in laws house and one SIL lives 10 mins away and the other still Lives with them. So now when we get together there\u2019s constant jabs at me for standing in the way of family and I\u2019m just a greedy bastard. They also say I\u2019ll never be able to build because it\u2019s going to take years before I\u2019m ready to build and I should just sell it to the sisters so they can start building.", "created_utc": 1685950000, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14161hl/aita_for_not_dividing_land_for_family_members/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The time for SIL\u2019s to have a piece of that land is long gone and they shouldn\u2019t be hounding you about it after you said no", "NTA- tell them all that if you hear one more word regarding the land, you will sell it to a third party for three times what it\u2019s worth.", "NTA.

Pay at market price, 60k then doesn\u2019t equal to 60k now and also the opportunity cost on what you could profit from that 60k you paid back then. \n\nThe house my family currently lives in was built on a piece of land that cost approx 360k when my dad bought it in 2012. The slightly smaller size of land on the same street market price is about 520k today.

Families get a discount only if you feel like giving it to them. And never at cost price", "NTA\n\nThey had every opportunity to buy the land last year but decided they weren't interested.  \n\nThey've realised they have made the wrong decision and now want the opportunity to get it from a year ago's price.\n\nYou are under no obligation to sell anything to them.  You have also paid more than just the purchase price to be where you are now ie those 2 years of back taxes.\n\nWhat was your FIL's answer when you asked him why it was offered to you and the BIL?  I do wonder whether he actually couldn't buy it (no access to funds) but he's unlikely to tell him that.\n\nHowever I would think twice about living so close to FIL.  The person living in the house on that land may be expected to care for the MIL and FIL because they are so close.. should they require care.\n\nThe only concession I would make here is look at what fair market rate would be for the subdivided block.  Also talk into account the cost of the back taxes that your in laws have not helped you pay.  And the cost of actually subdividing the land.\n\nPerhaps just offer the FIL first option to buy the whole block at the price you paid plus the costs you paid added on.  And your FIL can subdivide the land.  You walk away and just stay where you are.\n\nThis is always going to be an issue.  You'll either feel like you were cheated if you do divide.  If you don't your inlaws will not be very nice to you.", "NTA, they all had a chance, and didn't take it.  However, buying land next to them was probably a mistake, it's soured relations and tbh why would you now want to live next to them?\n\nMaybe sell the land and bank the profit.", "NTA. If you are not able to built it is because they didn't invest their saving into buying it when you did. If you still want to keep the relationship with the family though, a \"fair\" way to ask for renumeration would be - check out how much you actually paid (taxes, interest lost on your savings, interest on loans you had to pay, inflation, etc) and offer them a sale price based on that.", "NTA.   \nIt\u2019s your land, don\u2019t subdivide it, and never sell it to your entitled family.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKEEP your land - all were offered to buy it, all except you declined. Keep it for 20 years,and sell it then.", "NTA, your BIL and SIL had their chance. You don't owe them anything.", "NTA. That was FIL's deal towards the family, not yours. His deal was removed from the table when you were the only one who was interested in the purchase. You never offered that deal and they shouldn't expect you to honor an offer you didn't make.", "NTA that land belongs to you fair and square, they had their chance they wanted nothing to do with it, their just pissed. they were probably expecting the FIL to hand it to them for free, and when they realised you bought it, they now want the original offer. Don't let them guilt trip you into handing any of that land over.", "NTA. Your family is silly to think you'd sell land for the price you paid instead if current value", "It your land...full stop. NTA", "NTA but if I were you I would split it sell it to them at fair market value and move with your wife far away from them", "INFO: why is your wife apparently OK with the idea that her family apparently thinks it's totally fine to \"park\" the land using *your and her financial resources* for her siblings' convenience?", "Info \u2026 the previous owner was offered 109 for it but chose to sell, it to your family, through your fil for 60 so almost half fair market value. You only got this deal because you are family. I understand not selling to your sisters in law at cost but asking for fair market value is greedy when, using the same family connection, you got a huge discount.", "NAH- I understand their POV, you bought the land at a discount with promise to build on it, yet haven't. If FIL knew you would drag your feet he would have bought it himself.\n\n>I asked my FIL if I wasn\u2019t able to buy it if he would have, and he said yes but then I questioned why he offered it to me and my brother in law in the first place.\n\nWith that being said, You've stumbled upon a veritable gold mine and have no obligation to hand it over to anyone at this point. You'd be doing a nice thing, selling below market value to your family. But I can't call you an AH for simply NOT doing a nice thing. If your family escalates to harassment than they would be the AHs, but casually jabbing at you for being greedy doesn't make them an AH.", "So let me get this straight. You were offered the land at effectively half price. The rest of your family weren't interested in it, but a year later changed their mind.\n\nSo, basically because they were uninterested then, you feel they should pay roughly double, because you're not really treating them like family, but as a business deal.\n\nYou snooze, you lose, kind of thing.\n\nWell, it's not illegal to be cutthroat to family, and they're certainly not nice people either, but that's a harsh stance to take on family. Most people don't try to profit of family either.\n\nESH, but the lions share is yours.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

How about you provide the land for their house and they provide the house for your land? Where I live that would be a ridiculously good deal for them, because the land is worth at least 3x the cost of building a house.\n\nAlternatively, they could just pay market price for the land, which is the definition of fair.\n\nPeople say you should keep business and family separate.
