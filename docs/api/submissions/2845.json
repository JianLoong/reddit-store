His gf is insecure about your relationship with Dante and is being weird with you. But Dante is hosting and you asked him to disinvite his gf, which makes you an AH. The fact that he did as you said (and told his gf) is a little odd and is only going to make his gf more suspect of you.", "ESH you should not have asked him to uninvited her and for sakes he should not have done it.", "YTA.

If you want the friendship to continue, then I suggest a different approach in the future.", ">She thinks I shouldn\u2019t go if I\u2019m so uncomfortable around her instead of forcing him to uninvite her\n\n\n\nI agree with her completely. Frankly Dante should have told you that himself when you suggested his girlfriend not come, and if he keeps choosing you over his girlfriend he\u2019s gonna find himself single. If she didn\u2019t have a reason to distrust and dislike you before, she certainly does now.", "YTA. It sucks, but if she makes you uncomfortable, then YOU should choose not to go. If this person is truly your friend, I would use the trip as an opportunity to really try to get to know his girlfriend, even if things get weird.

What you did is not at all supportive and puts your friend in an extremely difficult position.", "YTA for asking him to not invite his girlfriend when he is providing the accommodations.. you could get a hotel to have separate accommodations.\n\n\nShe is the AH for making you uncomfortable. But ultimately you cannot decide who the friend invites on the trip if he is in charge of the accommodations", "ESH\n\nShe's insecure that he would prefer your company to hers, this could be based on something he's done or said or be completely unfounded, we don't know and neither do you.\n\nYou took this dilemma and decided to ask a man, friend or not, to uninvite his girlfriend instead of deciding to uninvite yourself.

That's really rude and entitled. Is there a reason you had more right to this trip than she did? You could have talked to Dante about the conversations you've had with the gf (and kept that separate from being anything about the trip), you could have decided to get your own accommodations or to not go, you could have gone without saying anything and just put distance between you and her, or even gone and gotten to know her better because she's someone that makes your friend happy and that's a nice thing to do for your friends. I get that she's insecure, but why does that need to be a big enough deal *for you* to disrupt the trip over it?", "ESH...she seems to be insecure about your friendship with him, but I feel like there were some other options here besides asking him to uninvite her. He definitely cemented her insecurity with you now and forever by choosing to uninvite her. That's either going to be a problem for them in the future or for your friendship with him.", "YTA\n\nHe's the one providing accommodation so he should be able to bring his partner along. You had the option not to go, if you were uncomfortable with the people he invited you could have chosen not to go. Also with multiple people on the trip you could avoid interacting with her too much.\n\nI don't even know if her behavior is all that objectionable either.\n\n>She\u2019s asked me things like if I find him attractive and if I would date him if he gave me the time of day. She also told me I definitely wasn\u2019t his type even though I never asked.\n\nGrace isn't necessarily asking or saying anything weird, at least not for a new-ish girlfriend. She's very obviously insecure about yours and Dante's relationship and/or trying to work out what the boundaries of your relationship is.\n\nThere's not enough information to tell if that's because you're doing something to make Grace think you're interested, OR if Dante is doing something to make her think he's interested in you OR if she's just insecure.\n\n>I don\u2019t want her on the trip so I asked Dante to not bring her \\[because she's made me uncomfortable with these questions\\].\n\nHowever, the fact that you asked him to leave his gf behind because she was worried about your relationship with Dante (and that he agreed to do it) suggests that your relationship is probably veering into uncomfortably close territory.\n\nI've had my friend's girlfriends ask me these questions before and I don't think they've ever made me properly uncomfortable, and certainly not to the point I'd ask my friend to ban their partner from a trip my friend was paying for.\n\nDid it occur to you that this trip could have been a chance to  reassure her and let her see there's nothing between you and Dante? That asking him to uninvite her would actually lead to her thinking her worst insecurities are true? Did you think Dante would lie to her about the reason she was uninvited?\n\nEdit to add: you caused a pick me or her situation and I think he picked you. That alone would suggest Grace isn't being the 'crazy jealous' gf.", "ESH.  \n\nYou don't get to make demands on a host. The mature thing to do would have been to sit down with Grace, and say that you are worried the two of you are miscommunicating, but you'd like to pursue,  at the very least, a social friendship. \n\nInstead, you made Dante have a conversation on your behalf. He should have refused.\n\nAnd Grace... well, let's assume you are right and she 's trying to make you uncomfortable. Then she sucks, too. \n\nAnyways, the punchline is that you all need to grow up.", "YTA. The girlfriend may be an AH to you too but your behavior tells me she may not be far off the mark. The bottom line is you are a guest of Dante who is providing the accommodation and you should not be allowed to dictate whether he can bring his gf. And he should never have uninvited her at your request. This is all pretty cringe.", "YTA. You asked him to exclude his girlfriend from a trip he\u2019s footing the bill for. No wonder she\u2019s suspicious.", "YTA - it\u2019s his girlfriend, you should stay home if you aren\u2019t comfortable.", "ESH.\nYou sound entitled and competitive, \"I was here first\" behavior is not something that you should be showing to your friends new partner, especially if you are as close as you are saying.\nOn the other hand, even if her insecurities may be triggered by your entitlement, she sounds like she does not have a good mechanism to get to the bottom of what kind of relationship you and Dante truly have.\nAnd Mr. Dante failed to manage the relationship with her and you because that is what a responsible heterosexual adult would do kinda automatically. If you are a male with true female friends, you know where boundaries go. If your partner belittles your friends from the beginning, that is a huge red flag, that kind of behavior never stops. If your friends don't respect your choice of a partner without giving you a good reason, you have to reevaluate those friendships. But even if this girlfriend character really is an obnoxious as they get with suspicions and jealousy, I still don't see how that makes you entitled to decide on Dantes behalf who is spending time with him on his property. Since you are going as a group, you sound even worse, because you are making all of it about you even though there will be other people to hang out with and you could easily bring any possibility of interacting with Grace to a polite minimum. If anyone here is older than 19, you should all go to therapy. That mindset brings no one no where good. So yes, ESH, which doesn't make you anything less than the AH.", "YTA\u2014Sorry!  Now I know you are female I see why his insecure GF asked you this.  You have the right to share your thoughts with your BF but not ask him to unitive her\u2014since he is covering trip you can stay elsewhere.", "YTA. You just proved her right to be suspicious of your relationship with him.", "Yeah.... YTA. He's giving you free accommodation, he can bring whomever he likes. If you're uncomfortable with a person who will be there, YOU should stay home.", "I mean, you basically are doing this to cause issues, aren\u2019t you? You could\u2019ve just been cordial during the trip, ask him to tell her not to say those weird things, or arrange alternate accommodations if you really can\u2019t stand her.

So in your actions you proved everything she was suspecting about you. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s actually true or not, her perception was that you wanted Dante for yourself and by getting her uninvited, in her mind, that\u2019s now confirmed. The long term implications of this are now Dante has to choose between you as a friend and her as a girlfriend and that\u2019s now fair to him", "YTA.  I mean come on.  She's insecure about how you and your response is to request time alone with her boyfriend with out her?\n\nPolitely withdraw from the ski weekend.", "YTA and you probably screwed this one up wayyyy bigger than it needed to be.

Why aren't you dating him?", "ESH. You all should be adults and address the actual issue between you and Grace. You insisting Dante uninvites her makes it look more and more like you're trying to put a wedge between them, even if you're not. Dante should never have listened to you. Instead, you and Grace should have sat down and had a conversation. You know you could have explained the situation and been mature. You could have even ignored her or said things to establish boundaries like \"What an odd thing to say out loud\" when she questions your relationship. I mean, she doesn't get out here Scot-free either because she clearly has a jealous streak if not more *but* you're not doing a very good job of proving you're not playing the long game with her boyfriend.\n\nMy suggestion is you *do* have that sit-down with her. Clear the air. Tell Dante she can come too because honestly, OP, this is now going to be more of a problem if you don't.\n\nETA: word correction.", "YTA. I mean, you are not the only one, but I think it's important to be clear that, in this particular case, you are the instigating asshole.\n\nIf you do not like your friend's girlfriend, then you should not go on this trip. If your friend, on reflection, does not like his girlfriend, he should break up with her. If your friend's girlfriend does not like the way your friend treats her (a feeling that would be very understandable in this situation), she should dump him.\n\nI understand why Grace is angry at you. Asking her boyfriend to uninvite her was a shitty thing for you to do.\n\nI understand why you don't want to spend time with Grace, but you do not control other people's invitation lists. I'd have said you were in the clear if you'd told your friend that you aren't comfortable with Grace, so you were gonna pass this trip, but that's not what you did.", "YTA, seems like overstepping to ask the host to uninvite his GF. And is he supposed to exclude her from everything now because you feel uncomfortable? I think you just need to deal with it.", "YTA - you are not his GF. Period. Get over yourself and apologize. You should also back out of the trip because you were so far out of line.", "YTA, what kind of thing is that? It's Dante who's hosting, if you don't feel comfortable about going, YOU don't go, don't tell him to uninvite his own girlfriend, what??", "YTA. People like you make me sick.", "YTA.  You don't get to dictate who he invites.  If she makes you uncomfortable,  YOU STEP BACK.  With a friend  like you, I'm surprised he has a girlfriend.", "NAH If you're not comfortable with his girlfriend coming in the trip stay home or get a hotel room. You don't get to dictate who someone invites on a vacation when they are providing the accommodations free of charge. He's not going to uninvite her so the ball is in your court.", "I think ESH. You'd be well within your rights to inform Dante about why she makes you uncomfortable & saying you wouldn't be going. Then, it's up to him. Telling him to disinvite her was unfair to Dante. Maybe, he'd have uninvited her anyway, but telling him what to do is poor manners.\n\nWhat she's doing is completely inappropriate. You should have brought this up with Dante sooner, because it really is a huge red flag. If it makes you feel better, I suspect Dante had some clue because he did wind up disinviting her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They would want to see him happy and get to know their new partner. Instead they're being petty about being rightfully questioned about their closeness. If there was really nothing wrong why would OP even be this upset? To the point of not wanting her to go? Any male friends I've had I've gone over the top to try and prove to their girlfriends that I'm not a threat. Unlike OP who thrives on the drama.

Dante could've probably handled this better, but he's caught in the middle and it's unfair to make this a GF vs OP choice imo. It's more like whether he's choosing to keep the original group intact, or bring in someone new at the expense of an OG member.

That was the sentence that gave me my verdict. I agree with you. If she didn't want to be with the girlfriend, she should have stayed behind.\n\nMost women have had other women ask us uncomfortable questions, and most of us just deal with it with good humour, understanding that new girlfriends are sometimes nervous about the guy's female friends. I've been the recipient of that conversation that OP had with the gf, and I just agreed that I was not my guy friend's type, as he was not mine, and I said it had never been an issue. And then that girl and I became close friends. Never in a million years would I have thought to ask him not to bring her to an event. I was an adult (of 21) and I decided to make it work without creating enemies.\n\nOP, what you did was entitled and selfish. Something I would expect from a 14 year-old.

So either he\u2019s unsure about her, or he\u2019s easily manipulated by whomever has his ear (in this instance, you). \nSo he\u2019s a soft AH as he tried to make you happy, which in turn has made problems in his own relationship because of you. \n\nIf you really value him as a friend, you also have to give a little bit sometimes.", "YTA. That's his girlfriend. I don't like plenty of my friends girlfriends/wives/husbands but just because I dislike them doesn't mean I get to act like its my place to uninvite them to accommodation someone else is paying for.  \n\nYou're kind of behaving very entitled to your friend and his time and his money in a weird way, no wonder she asked those questions. You probably rang every alarm in her head rightfully so, only to then confirm them.", "YTA.  So I noticed you didn\u2019t provide the usual M/F info.  Either way, telling someone not to bring their SO after the person has already been invited is an AH move. As others have stated, you should have just said thanks for inviting me but I\u2019m going to sit this one out.", "YTA, and so is Dante. Who the hell asks the host to uninvite their partner? She\u2019s right about you, \ud83d\udcaf", "YTA. It is his place, his girlfriend and you are way off base trying to call shots. If you\u2019re uncomfortable don\u2019t go", "Info: Did you talk to Dante about the GF questions before asking him to un-invite his gf or was you asking Dante to un-invite her the first for him to hear that she was making you uncomfortable?\n\nAlso did the gf not believed you when you told here there were no chemistry of that nature between you and Dante or something else while talking to her?", "YTA", "YTA, if you don't see him romantically you shouldn't be so easily threatened by his gf attending the trip. Not to mention everyone else is onboard with her going.", " YTA and the wrong person was asked not to attend", "If he\u2019s paying who are you to complain.\n\nNow his girlfriend will definitely dislike you and not trust you.", "YTA. His accommodation, his rules. She does sound weird, but it's a package deal.", "I mean how much of say do you really have if he\u2019s paying for it", "YTA. He is the host and can invite whoever he wants. If you're uncomfortable with the guest list you can choose to not go.", "YTA \n\nYou just make the situation worse. The gf is right to be suspicious", "ESH. It honestly kind of sounds like you have issues sharing your friend's attention with a new person. She's insecure and a bit mean (presumably because she feels threatened by you), and you are making a mess of it all instead of just talking things through like adults.", "YTA\n\nthe way you felt so entitled to ask dante to disinvite her and he complied pretty much sums up why his girlfriend felt insecure enough to ask you those questions lol", "YTA, that's his gf, he's providing the accommodation. The fact that he's willing to uninvite her at your request suggests that he really doesn't value his relationship with her", "Is everyone involved 15 years old?", "You should grow up IMHO.", "Definitely yta", "ESH. The GF said some really inappropriate things to you. But that was your responsibility to bring up with her. You could have told her that this was bothering you instead of asking for her to be uninvited. Dante should have told you no as he is paying for all of this.", "YTA. Major mean girl vibes. Poor gf", "Info- are you a woman or man", "IDK, maybe OP has been making it weird for awhile, \"disinvite your girlfriend from the ski trip, because she asked if I'd ever date you and that makes being comfortable\". This is the sort of thing you do if you want to break up your friend and their GF. \n\nGF acted insecure but was about a 2 or maybe a 4 on the weird scale op went right to 11 like spinal tap( op is a parody of jealous possessive bff)\n\nOp said jump and bf immediately proved girlfriend suspicions. Whether Op is interested in the guy or not op can and will inset herself in his relationship and op will win. I honestly would expect her to break up with bf over this.  And asking  a few awkward questions could have just turned into a funny story.", "I agree with this. Girlfriend certainly seems jealous and insecure, I probably would have waited for her to [figuratively] hang herself because it seems like she can\u2019t help herself and it\u2019ll only be a matter of time before Dante gets a front row seat to the nonsense", "This is well put", "INFO: How many other people are going on this trip?", "Yep! Originally I thought the GF just had some insecurities, but OP seems to be validating them", "I think they're downlow and she caught on he's jealous of sharing his man lol", "This right here\n\nYTA", "How many other girlfriends have you been \u201cuncomfortable\u201d with and chased off?", "Regardless of the context, the person to ask those questions to is Dante. I think asking intimate questions to people you aren\u2019t close to is out of bounce. You don\u2019t have a right to ask virtual strangers intimate questions. That is crazy entitled.", "There\u2019s your answer then silly", "YTA but so is Dante.  You should have never asked him to uninvite his gf and he never should have done it.  Sounds like the gf might have reason to ask these questions and if she has no reason to be concerned why does she make you uncomfortable.  If anyone should stay home it\u2019s you.", "Girlfriend is obviously trying to mark her territory, so your solution is to further antagonize her by asking him not to bring her? Are you nuts?\n\nYTA", "INFO: Did you tell them what she said? Or that she is making inappropriate comments and asking inappropriate questions? Simply saying she makes you uncomfortable is probably why the group is split. They should know what\u2019s going on because excluding her from one event doesn\u2019t help the problem. I\u2019m assuming he likes her and would want to invite her to future events. So if you aren\u2019t asking him to choose between you and her, he needs to address the issue directly.", "YTA\u2026 girl you need to back off, he is someone else bf.", "NTA. You asked, he thought about it and made his decision. He could have said no. Reading the comments it sounds like a lot of other people are thinking he\u2019s paying for and organizing the whole trip and basing their judgement off of that. Changes things a little if you\u2019re also paying. I\u2019d be pissed if I shelled out money for a trip with friends and then someone\u2019s SO that has been harassing me horned their way in. He didn\u2019t even invite her in the first place.", "The girlfriend sees you as a threat and is jealous.  Cancel on the trip.", "YTA and he\u2019s a terrible boyfriend.  He should never have put a friend first. Because you did this he will eventually have to choose either you or her. Prepare to lose a lifetime friend.", "YTA - Regardless of your relationship with him, your request was rude and disrespectful. He shouldn't even entertain it. He's footing the bill. He has a right to bring his partner. If you're that uncomfortable, don't interact with her or join then. Honestly, I don't blame the girlfriend being upset.", "YTA. You should've let her come so she would see she has nothing to worry about, unless she does.", "YTA you don\u2019t get a say in who goes, if you feel so uncomfortable you should probably sit this one out.", "YTA but with more info I\u2019d amend it to ESH.\n\nYou don\u2019t get to dictate who goes in a trip and you put your friend in an awful position. You should have shared your concerns with him and talked to see if common ground could be found, set boundaries, etc. Your behavior and her behavior = jealous GF behavior and that nonsense causes a ton of drama.\n\nMaybe I\u2019ll amend to ESH right now. Dante is an AH for not having a mature discussion about it and just caving. She\u2019s an AH if she\u2019s intentionally making comments to cause strife. You\u2019re an AH for putting Dante in that position.\n\nBasically, you all sound immature and insecure.\n\nEdited bc I stupidly switched friend and BF.", "Info: what part of the trip plans are you paying for? Is there a flight?\n\nRight now I\u2019m going to say NTA and here is why, the GF is inviting herself after all the plans were made, Dante asked if it was alright and OP said she rather not have her there. He shouldn\u2019t have asked if he had the intention of bringing her if anyone says they weren\u2019t comfortable.\n\nI think Dante sucks here for not just saying that he was bringing his gf but giving an option, by asking and not just informing everyone you open it up to creating an issue", "YTA. His accommodation. His girlfriend. The fact you think he should exclude his own girlfriend for your benefit is:\n\n1. Bonkers, and more importantly\n\n2. Literally vindicates her suspicions.", "I wanted to say E S H but after reading how extremely defensive you are in the comments I am gonna go with YTA, if you don\u2019t want to hear other opinions please stop posting on AITA. \n\nThe girlfriend does sound super insecure if we take your word as 100% true but what you did will only feed this insecurity even more. You could have just backed out or payed for your own accommodations if she made you so uncomfortable. Dante also sucks, I would have told you to buzz off if you made that request.", "INFO:\n\nhave you spoken to Dante about the questions and comments? what did he say?", "Look i would have personally let her come and ignored her but oh well. Your friend took your side and she's not coming. She will definitely not like you now. I don't know if you are an AH. I don't think it's that simple. He's your friend you were invited first. If you feel bad apologize if not enjoy your trip.", "NTA-you voiced your concerns and feelings to a friend of yours. Dante can make his own decision after that. He can uninvite her, tell you he respects your feelings and thank you for sharing but still wants grace to come, you can not go if its such a problem, or you can all go and be polite/ cordial. Lots of options here but you are NTA for speaking up for yourself. \nGrace seems like a walking red flag anyway.\nEveryone saying YTA are probably people who are afraid to take up space irl and shrink and make themselves smaller. Kudos to you for speaking up.", "That's only if OP is an impartial and reliable narrator, which given her absolutely bonkers opinion that he should exclude his own gf for her, is a fairly dangerous assumption.\n\nYTA, just because OP's actions here vindicate the gf's suspicions in spades.", "Is Dante the drama? Is he the villain?", "In OPs defense if one of my friends had a SO always asking questions I\u2019d bring it up to my friend too. The real problem is that OP asked/demanded instead of having a conversation with her friend and asking to work to address the issues.\n\nThat being said ESH.", "Didn\u2019t read pick me. I think anyone would be uncomfortable if someone continues to act like you want their boyfriend. I had a best friend that was a guy for years then he got a girlfriend and she never liked me. Only because he\u2019d vent to me like best friends do. He would say they don\u2019t like me because they think I was trying to get with him. Which was never true and nothing in our conversations would suggest it. He stopped talking to me because his girlfriend didn\u2019t like it, then they\u2019d break up and he act like it wasn\u2019t a problem. I forgave him but the last time he had a girlfriend he was planning to leave her but was scared because he worked for her dad. He got her pregnant so he stayed tho. One day she got his phone and just started sending me insults about my life he knew about. I think him telling her my personal business and letting her use my hard times (abusive relationship) against me were out of line so I blocked him and it\u2019s been two years. I\u2019m friends with people he\u2019s introduced me to and have invited me to events but I refuse because I don\u2019t want the drama and he knew em first. They\u2019re still together and she sent me an apology message. I guess our friends talked to her and I don\u2019t know but I left her on read because she didn\u2019t know me or what I\u2019ve been through but what she was told or had read but tried to use that information to hurt me.  \n\nSo I say ESH, her for being insecure and acting like you\u2019re the problem & you for letting yourself stay in that situation instead of just not going. There will be more trips and more friends. If she says it to you, she says it to him and he\u2019s not making her feel any better about your friendship. Which also makes him ta because he probably enjoys it or tells her things to make it sound you\u2019re into him.", "She LITERALLY asked him not to bring his gf (that had already been invited and likely gotten herself excited for the trip) that she knows feels insecure about their friendship...instead of attempting to have a mature conversation with the both of them about the elephant in the room before the trip. That reads exactly \"pick me.\"\n\nWe all have stories that may influence our judgement here. For example, my ex had a very close friend that I picked up vibes with, but after calmy and openely attempting to talk about what I had picked up between them one time, they both swore up and down that it was and has always been only friendship...so I believed them and left it alone...until they made out with each other while I was out of town...\n\nNeither of our experiences are evidence to what is really occurring here. \n\nMost people are saying ESH because the girlfriend's comments were weird and uncomfortable, myself included. It doesn't change the fact that OP asking his friend to ditch his girlfriend is ALSO an AH move and not at all the same thing as being validated in feeling uncomfortable.", "Then you should have stayed elsewhere"]}
