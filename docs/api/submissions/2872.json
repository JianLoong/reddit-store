Because proposing to someone without warning in a hostile environment specifically to annoying your family feels kind of shitty.", "YTA and not emotionally mature enough for marriage.", "You proposed just to make a statement? Was your BF okay with this?", "ESH.\n\nI know this is gonna sound condescending, but you're young and in my experience you're gonna learn that pulling stunts like these - and that's what this was, an immature stunt - does nothing in the long run to help change the minds of those people. If anything, you've just reinforced their beliefs. \n\nIt's not about putting up with the homophobia or worrying about rocking the boat-- you should stand up for yourself, but there are more productive ways to engage with people like that. And if that's not a possibility, then cutting them off and living your best life is WAY healthier than \"showing them\" or \"getting back at them.\" \n\nAnother thing: we are not just our sexuality-- don't let others reduce you to that and most of all, don't reduce yourself to it. Each of us has an opportunity to show we may be gay but that's just part of us, we're still the same person they've spent x amount of years with, some from the moment we were born. We have a chance to put a face and history and try to make them understand gay people are just PEOPLE. I would say you shouldn't subject yourself to constant homophobia but don't write people off entirely based on past behavior. Even if they've been the shitty homophobic relatives, you attract more bees with honey than vinegar...", "ESH\nYou used your boyfriend to give the finger to your family. He deserved better than being taken to a group of homophobes and the proposal being turned into a spectacle for people hostile to him.", "ESH: your dad\u2019s statement that a fianc\u00e9 is expected is weird and AH-ish. Why the hell would you want a fianc\u00e9 just for the sake of having a fianc\u00e9? (This doesn\u2019t read \u201cI love Brad so much and can\u2019t wait for him to be part of the family\u201d, he just wants \u201ca\u201d fianc\u00e9 but doesn\u2019t care who?). And why would you expect your 19 year old to be engaged? That\u2019s so young!\n\nAnd then you\u2019re the AH for using your significant other as a pawn to make drama. You didn\u2019t propose there out of love, it wasn\u2019t about you and him, you did it to make a stir. This sounds very childish.", "YTA. You were \"laughing your ass off\" because you stuck it to your family instead of having a romantic moment. Using him as a pawn to piss off your family and make a point is shitty. If this was an event where toasts were appropriate and you used it as a way to get attention, that is bad form as well.\n\nYou seem immature all around, especially since you may have made this up seeing as your profile says you are she/her.", "It purely depends on wether you communicated your plans with your bf.  It seems he only thought about a kiss, not a proposal.  First of all, proposing in front of many people always gives me weird vibes, because it puts the other person  on the spot. Second of all: some people want their proposal to be a special and intimate moment. Not something I wan't to happen in a hostile environment full of people  against your  relationship. So if you did not communicate all of this with your bf Y T A, if you did and he was all for it N T A.", "ESH only because you put your boyfriend in a hostile environment for you own benefits and where only thinking about what you wanted not really what your bf may have wanted", "I'm going to go YTA because you knew what the reaction would be.\n\nWho would want their proposal to end with yelling, arguing and being thrown out?", "YTA.\n\nFor the rest of your lives, your fiance is going to remember that what should have been one of the most romantic moments of his life was instead used to stick it to your family. And you can\u2019t redo that moment or get it back. \n\nI\u2019d strongly encourage maturing a little before you plan on actually getting married.", "More info needed- what type of family gathering was this? Usually toasts aren\u2019t made unless it\u2019s a birthday, engagement, wedding, wedding or baby shower, retirement or some other celebratory event.\n\nIf it was a celebration for someone else, then it would be bad form to propose regardless of your sexual orientation. If you also did it to stick it to your family, then it\u2019s doubly bad form to use your SO as a pawn like that.", "Your proposal wasn't from love or with your now-fiancee in mind. It was all about shoving it in your family's faces. \n\nWhat was the point? For you to show that you don't care about their opinions? Well, you must do since you went to all this trouble for them. YTA, cause its so pointless and you ruined what should have been a special moment between you and your fiancee.", "ESH\n\nIf your BF was fine with it that's cool but he deserved to be proposed to in a more romantic/loving way....not as a FU to your folks.", "ESH. You for acting like a child and not showing enough maturity to not use your Bf as an object to piss off your unsupportive parents.

You're just really, really childish.  Which isn't exactly a condemnation.  You're a teenager.  Of course you're childish.     \n\n\nThat being said, neither of you is old enough to get engaged, let alone married.        And \"I have experience with children and love them!\" doesn't magically translate to \"education career\".    \n\n\nWord of advice from someone old enough to be your mom:   go to university.   Meet people, explore new ideas.   Finish your degree and go to graduate school if you want to be a teacher.   \n\n\nIf this relationship is meant to be, you'll still be together six or so years from now and at that point, talking about an engagement makes sense.", "YTA because you used a lot of people for drama there.", "ESH\n\nplease don\u2019t get married, you are too young and you and your BF seem very immature if this is how your proposal goes down. Perhaps wait until the two of you are more settled in life.

But all of the parents still think they\u2019re too young for marriage, because SO MUCH growth happens during the first few years of adulthood. Please consider extending your engagement until your educations are complete, so you can start married life on the best possible footing.

Who was going to expose their boyfriend to the malice and spite of those people by rejecting that proposal?\n\nAccepting the proposal does speak volumes.

It's silly to assume that they aren't happy to be engaged though.  I've never seen someone get engaged of their own free will and be *unhappy* about it.", "I mean, read the entire thread. Lots of people have stated they would feel disrespected.", "If you think this is \"of their own free will\", then you're ignoring the explanation of the enormous amount of social pressure that OP willfully put on their SO.", "Not one of them speak for OP's SO.", "I'm just saying, actions speak louder than words.  If OP's SO wants to back out of the engagement, they will.  Until then, I think it's safe to think they're happy with being engaged."]}
