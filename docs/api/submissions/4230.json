What church do your parents go to? Because that sounds extreme .  \n\n2. Does the will stipulate college? Can they use it for trade school or other educational options?", "Not only are you NTA but you are an absolute badass. I'm sorry to hear about your prognosis. It's a terrible situation but you could not possibly handle it any better.\n\nYou sound like you've done your research and you've got things covered so feel free to disregard this advice: You might want to give them a minimum amount so they won't be able to contest the will.", "> I just heard from my brother. He is calling me an asshole for depriving his kids of help and forcing my parents into a shitty position.\n\nYeah nope. My response to that would have been \u201cpot, kettle, bye\u201d. \n\nNTA. It\u2019s your money. Your parents cut you off for going to college. They should expect nothing from you. \n\nIf your nieces are old enough to understand I would tell them about the money and stipulations as well, because I could definitely see your parents not telling them about it at all to keep them home near their culty church.", "Nta. As a parent myself I can't imagen the stress and pain you must be going threw thinking about worse case scenario you dying and leaving your kids, I am so very sorry. Your parents are the worse kind of people ever - what kind of parents care only about money and not the fact thst thier child is sick?", "NTA, I'm very proud of what you're doing for your nieces. Your parents suck and don't deserve a goddamn cent. \n\nOn a personal note though, I wasn't able to get through college by the time I was 25 for medical reasons. Sticking it to your parents through progressive charities might feel good and I fully support it. But maybe once your nieces are adults, make sure they are able to receive physical and mental care.", "NTA...Firstly,  I'm sorry about your prognosis.  Your money is for you to do whatever feels right to you. Your parents have shown that their decision making is severely flawed", "NTA\n\nYou are helping - your nieces. Your parents have made their decisions, if their church was so helpful keeping them away from your assistance maybe they should pony up and help pay for their ongoing needs as well.\n\nAnd - I\u2019m sorry about your recent prognosis, you sound like a rad as fuck human; and things like this suck. Kia kaha", "NTA\n\nIt's your money.\n\nHowever the title is wrong. You don't let your parents choose. Your parents have nothing to do with it. You give your nieces a chance for an post secondary education. \n\nYou might wanna change the age the money must be spend on education to 30 as it can take a while before your nieces get out of the influence of your parents and other relatives. After they are 25 they might regret not getting a secondary education.\n\nNot everybody is as strong as you for going against the will of the church and their parents as you are at that age.", "NTA I'm so truly sorry for what you are going through, and I'm hoping you miraceously manage to get through this and recover, whatever your prognosis may be.\n\nYou're doing the right thing, and you know this. Ensuring your nieces a decent education and a better future is the absolute best thing you can do for them. And you know that giving your parents money is a terrible idea, it will most likely be wasted. They refuse custody or for you to even SEE your nieces?! Then covering their basic living costs is on them. End of story. They're horrible people, and you clearly care about what is best for your nieces, and it shows.\n\nAs long as you're covered legally, which it sounds like you are, then I think it may be time to just go no contact with your parents and brother. The last thing you need to do is deal with their nonsense. Take care of yourself and focus on your own family now.", "NTA And their lack of compassion for you and your family at this time is shocking and disturbing, tbh.

You have thought this through and put plans in place to protect your husband, children and nieces.  You are NTA in any way.  Your parents and brother suck for expecting you to pay for other people's children and pressuring you at a time when you are dealing with your own health issues.  Focus on your family and taking care of yourself.  Don't give this any more of your precious time.", "NTA in any way. You are not obliged to provide them with anything.

I\u2019m sorry you haven\u2019t been able to obtain custody. I\u2019m wondering if it can still happen at some point, if your parents are truly in a spot where they can\u2019t adequately support the girls.

Take lots of pictures. Make sure the memories will last. Do some of the stuff you've always wanted to but never done, even if you can't do all of it.\n\nAnd don't let petulant family members drag you into fights over money they were never owed - it is generous that you are giving your nieces anything at all.", "NTA but gosh your family sound like the assholes\n\nThey have cut you off because of disagreement about religion.. OP you are unwell and are trying your your best to organise for the future. You seem kind and thoughtful \n\nYou have offered to adopt and support your nieces. They have chosen to adopt them and are upset about the financial responsibilities. You owe them nothing. \n\nI read on another comment you are stipulating that the money can be use for any education and accommodation related expenses. You guys seem so generous. \n\nStop stressing about your entitled family members, finish organising your estate and enjoy your precious time with your husband and children.

It's clear your parents oppose that, so it makes MUCH more sense to secure their ability to get education on the long term and enable them to have choices rather than to bail out your parents on the short term.\n\nOF COURSE they will not see it that way. Pay them no regard, they do not have the girls' best interests at heart (even though they *believe* they do). And the family complaining are free to donate their own money to help out the family and church. People should *not*  be waiting like vultures for you to die to receive a payout.

And your husband needs to approve the institution and that it cannot be one that is associated with any religion. \nA very simple reason for that; they might be signed up for accredited classes in a Cristian school for button sewing, just for your parents to get the money to  institutions of their choice, make the girls stay home with them \u201cto save on expenses\u201d like good girls, and marry them off and take the money for themselves, while charging them rent and food. \nIn that way, you ensure your husband has contact with them and that they are not coerced, and that they have money in their bank accounts to move away.", "Not necessarily.
