Baylor faculty teach the theory of evolution and believe in science/ modern medicine. They even strongly encouraged everyone on campus to get their covid vaccine and test regularly. Yes, it\u2019s faith centered (largest baptist school in the world) i.e you have to go to chapel for 2 semesters and take a course on the history of religion and Christian scriptures. But they do have co-ed dorms, Greek life, all the run of the mill college stuff. The strictest rule was that it was a dry campus and classified your body as a container if you\u2019ve been drinking.

My mom went to Pensacola Christian Academy in the 1970s but left after her freshman year and finished high school in my hometown. It was a regular high school, but still located in a small Southern town, so it obviously still had its disadvantages. My grandmother (her mother) went to Bob Jones in the 1950s. I was born in \u201886 and lived with my mom primarily (my parents were divorced and dad got us every other weekend), and my grandmother lived down the street from us so she was essentially a part of our every day lives. We went to church pretty regularly with our mom when we were really little but she stopped making us go around age 12 or 13. \n\nI don\u2019t have any memory of either my mom or grandmother having super hardcore religious beliefs. My mom raised us to be tolerant of EVERYONE and we were never taught to treat anyone as less than, particularly if they were a different ethnicity from us or if they were part of the LGBTQ community. Mom also had quite a few gay friends when I was young. My grandmother believed in a woman\u2019s right to independence and she worked pretty consistently from the 1960s to the early 2000s. She also divorced my granddad after 49 years of marriage because she didn\u2019t feel that she should be stuck in a loveless marriage for the rest of her life, especially since she was more than capable of providing for herself. She *and* my mother would constantly stress to us that having \u201ca man\u201d was not necessary or a requirement. They\u2019d both divorced men that left much to be desired, and they wanted to ensure that I and my sisters never settled for some *asshole*, just so we could say that we had a husband. They encouraged us to get college degrees when we graduated high school, as opposed to marriages and babies. \n\nThankfully I never had to find out if my grandmother would have been a Trump supporter. She developed dementia shortly before he was elected and she passed away in 2020. As far as I know she was a Republican, but I never heard or saw her confirm her political views in any way. My mom is definitely *not* a Trump supporter and she also no longer attends church. \n\nIf I had to guess, I would say that, in *both* of their cases, going to religious schools probably had the opposite affect; and caused them to want to distance themselves from the kinds of things that places like that teach girls and women.", "Why ya gotta drown a whole city over one college!?", "I grew up near Waco, and they didn\u2019t allow dancing until the mid-90s.

I went to the University of Texas, and I can assure you we didn\u2019t have *any* school-sponsored dances because that is some crazy Baptist nonsense. We just partied downtown or got wasted at house parties like normal college students.  \n\nUMHB in Belton is a smaller version of the same song and dance (pun intended).
