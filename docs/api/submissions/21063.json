Just tell him you wohld prefer staying elsewhere. Most AirBNB\u2019s have a good cancel policy", "NTA. Bait and switch. He booked it and gave you no say in the matter. It would have seemed somewhat churlish to refuse, since he was offering this for free.\n\nIf he had presented this new arrangement at the beginning, you'd have said, \"No thanks\" and booked your own place. Given this, you could say \"Thanks, but we can do better, just cancel our stay\". Others may wish to do the same.", "NTA but... you should chip in an amount you deem fair with a statement that in the future, any travel arrangements will need to be agreed upon by everyone in advance. \n\n\nOur family trips turned into insane groups of 15-20 people staying in 1 house with 4 bedrooms (giant home, but not enough beds) & all the \"adults\" chipping in. So I'd chip in our \"per person\" amount & end up sleeping on the f'n floor in a sleeping bag next to my kids & all the grandkids because the oldest adults & sometimes guests of extended family would get the beds. I could have gone to a hotel, spent less money, had beds, a bathroom & a good night's sleep.  I finally did that & of course the people who complained about added expense to them (since I was no longer chipping in for my family of 4) were the ones who had been sleeping in the beds. \n\n\nYou have to nip this in the bud.", "NTA. Your dad adjusted his plans and became money conscious so you have very right to do the same. He wants luxury but doesn\u2019t want to pay it. Be honest. Tell your dad that you have made other accommodations because it is much more cost effective for your family budget. Tell him that you would have had no problem paying for the Airbnb if it had been discussed with you earlier on and you had initially agreed to it. Even if you end up going to the Airbnb your father needs to hear your concerns for future reference. Hopefully he still has time to cancel. If you don\u2019t have this discussion now he will do this again in the future.", "NAH. If you can, chip in at least what you would have paid. Also, offer to cover a meal and cook in that night. Yes, you lose privacy, but you gain a lot of fun and experiences staying together.", "NTA.\n\nCancel the airbnb he booked and book somewhere cheaper for everyone after you have told them the price and they've agreed.\n\nIf your parents want to stay somewhere expensive and fancy, that's on them. If they want to pay for you to stay with them, that's generous.", "I think the real question is do you want to help out your dad \n\nSure you could've put your foot down and get something separate but you didn't and now he is stressed. Are you financially able to help him out or do you not want to simply bc he put you in the situation? If you have the means to financially help a bit then I'd say you'd be TA if you didn't", "YWNBTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBook your own place - just for you and your wife - and let him cancel. You will enjoy staying in a place withoput them much more anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTell huim you don't even want to stay in that AirBnB, becaause you will use the time around the wedding for a romantic escape with your wife, just the two of you.", "Can you cancel? NTA", "YWBTA\n\nIt's true that you have never discussed the AirBnB, but it's also true that you have never formally refused to go there.  \n\nCould the accommodation have been discussed and organized better than this?  Yes, but I wouldn't break the family peace for this reason: you risk discussions and quarrels near the cousin's wedding, who doesn't deserve this.", "I'm going with soft YTA for jumping immediately to \"refusing\" to pay. I agree the situation is not fair, but I think you should talk to your dad and explain what you said here and maybe you can come to a more satisfactory solution, like paying the cost of half a night or booking somewhere else (if possible at this point).", "YWBTA \n\nExperience is worth so much more than a little extra money.  You\u2019ll have time to share cheaper hotel rooms alone with your wife, but how often will you share a space like this with your family?  Help your parents, if you can, and enjoy some time with them - that goes fast.  If there is a next time, offer to make the arrangements.", "YTA, yes he booked it but you only pay one night. Also, usually if you book an Airbnb you have/had time to cancel it and get a full refund. Why didn't you talk to your dad?", "YTA why not enjoy being with your family for a vacation. It\u2019s kinda ridiculous you were just planning to go and completely leech off your parents for a vacation is ridiculous I don\u2019t know anyone who wouldn\u2019t be offering to pay at least part of the way themselves. And now that your parents are tighter on money you want to complain about a family vacation where you get to stay in a nicer place LOL", "\"To add to that, we would have privacy and autonomy as it would have been for just me and my wife.\"\n\nInfo: Are you and your wife not getting your own room?\n\nUnless you don't get your own room an Airbnb is almost certainly much more room compared to a hotel room. Plus you get much more privacy versus being in a hotel. \n\nI think since the total cost of one night is what you would have paid, you should pay that. It would be different if it ended up being more than what a hotel would be. But it is not.", "For me, YTA. It\u2019s your dad, he\u2019s worried about money, and you are going to stay there - at first, completely free. Yeah he should have thought it through better but unless he has a history of trying scam you or get you to pay for his luxuries, throw some money in if you can this one time. If it happened again, then I\u2019d say that it was out of budget/he should have consulted you and you can\u2019t help.  This is one of those things that technically you can say, not my responsibility, pay for it yourself. But it\u2019s not the kind thing to do on a one off.", "You are the asshole. Your dad has little money as he is now retired . Support your dad and next time do the work of finding the hotel yourself .", "INFO\n\nWhat's the price difference? One night vs four nights at a place you would have booked.  How much nicer is this place vs the other place?", "Yta, you\u2019re a mooch and a cheap fuck", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Dude was likely a professional who got paid professional wages and bought a nice ass house for 350k that\u2019s now valued between 800k and 1M. He\u2019s not poor, he\u2019s just a bad planner.", "Assuming they have their own room they have more privacy because the common areas of the house are only shared with family. \n\nIn a hotel the common areas are shared with a lot more people that are complete strangers. \n\nThe room in the Airbnb is likely around the same size as a hotel room would be."]}
