Just tell him you wohld prefer staying elsewhere. Most AirBNB\u2019s have a good cancel policy", "NTA. Bait and switch. He booked it and gave you no say in the matter. It would have seemed somewhat churlish to refuse, since he was offering this for free.\n\nIf he had presented this new arrangement at the beginning, you'd have said, \"No thanks\" and booked your own place. Given this, you could say \"Thanks, but we can do better, just cancel our stay\". Others may wish to do the same.", "NTA but... you should chip in an amount you deem fair with a statement that in the future, any travel arrangements will need to be agreed upon by everyone in advance. \n\n\nOur family trips turned into insane groups of 15-20 people staying in 1 house with 4 bedrooms (giant home, but not enough beds) & all the \"adults\" chipping in. So I'd chip in our \"per person\" amount & end up sleeping on the f'n floor in a sleeping bag next to my kids & all the grandkids because the oldest adults & sometimes guests of extended family would get the beds. I could have gone to a hotel, spent less money, had beds, a bathroom & a good night's sleep.  I finally did that & of course the people who complained about added expense to them (since I was no longer chipping in for my family of 4) were the ones who had been sleeping in the beds. \n\n\nYou have to nip this in the bud.", "NTA. Your dad adjusted his plans and became money conscious so you have very right to do the same. He wants luxury but doesn\u2019t want to pay it. Be honest. Tell your dad that you have made other accommodations because it is much more cost effective for your family budget. Tell him that you would have had no problem paying for the Airbnb if it had been discussed with you earlier on and you had initially agreed to it. Even if you end up going to the Airbnb your father needs to hear your concerns for future reference. Hopefully he still has time to cancel. If you don\u2019t have this discussion now he will do this again in the future.", "NAH. If you can, chip in at least what you would have paid. Also, offer to cover a meal and cook in that night. Yes, you lose privacy, but you gain a lot of fun and experiences staying together.", "NTA.\n\nCancel the airbnb he booked and book somewhere cheaper for everyone after you have told them the price and they've agreed.\n\nIf your parents want to stay somewhere expensive and fancy, that's on them. If they want to pay for you to stay with them, that's generous.\n\nIf they're expecting you to subsidise their luxury holiday then that's ... fraud?", "I think the real question is do you want to help out your dad \n\nSure you could've put your foot down and get something separate but you didn't and now he is stressed. Are you financially able to help him out or do you not want to simply bc he put you in the situation?

NTA", "YWBTA\n\nIt's true that you have never discussed the AirBnB, but it's also true that you have never formally refused to go there.  \n\nCould the accommodation have been discussed and organized better than this?  Yes, but I wouldn't break the family peace for this reason: you risk discussions and quarrels near the cousin's wedding, who doesn't deserve this.", "I'm going with soft YTA for jumping immediately to \"refusing\" to pay. I agree the situation is not fair, but I think you should talk to your dad and explain what you said here and maybe you can come to a more satisfactory solution, like paying the cost of half a night or booking somewhere else (if possible at this point).", "YWBTA \n\nExperience is worth so much more than a little extra money.  You\u2019ll have time to share cheaper hotel rooms alone with your wife, but how often will you share a space like this with your family?  Help your parents, if you can, and enjoy some time with them - that goes fast.  If there is a next time, offer to make the arrangements.", "YTA, yes he booked it but you only pay one night. Also, usually if you book an Airbnb you have/had time to cancel it and get a full refund. Why didn't you talk to your dad?", "YTA why not enjoy being with your family for a vacation. It\u2019s kinda ridiculous you were just planning to go and completely leech off your parents for a vacation is ridiculous I don\u2019t know anyone who wouldn\u2019t be offering to pay at least part of the way themselves. And now that your parents are tighter on money you want to complain about a family vacation where you get to stay in a nicer place LOL", "\"To add to that, we would have privacy and autonomy as it would have been for just me and my wife.\"\n\nInfo: Are you and your wife not getting your own room?\n\nUnless you don't get your own room an Airbnb is almost certainly much more room compared to a hotel room. Plus you get much more privacy versus being in a hotel. \n\nI think since the total cost of one night is what you would have paid, you should pay that. It would be different if it ended up being more than what a hotel would be. But it is not.", "For me, YTA. It\u2019s your dad, he\u2019s worried about money, and you are going to stay there - at first, completely free. Yeah he should have thought it through better but unless he has a history of trying scam you or get you to pay for his luxuries, throw some money in if you can this one time. If it happened again, then I\u2019d say that it was out of budget/he should have consulted you and you can\u2019t help.  This is one of those things that technically you can say, not my responsibility, pay for it yourself. But it\u2019s not the kind thing to do on a one off.", "You are the asshole.

OP makes it pretty clear he and his wife prefer to have some private space when at family gatherings and that\u2019s perfectly respectable. Doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t stop in to the Airbnb, go out to dinners, heck even get ready there if the family wants time. But I totally get wanting a hotel over a family AirBnB if I\u2019m paying for it.", "The OP didn't agree beforehand, but he did agree afterwards, so him refusing to pay on those grounds doesn't fly.

I think OP could be the asshole if he told his dad to go ahead and book it - but dad did that without asking and initially said not to worry about the cost. It\u2019s not really ridiculous to be upset someone else signed you up for something you could not afford without asking. Seems like OP was planning to pay their own way by getting a hotel room and not staying with family.", "What???\n\nYou get zero privacy bc you are sharing the space with all of the other family members.", "His dad does not have \u201clittle money\u201d if he just retired and his first inclination upon booking the trip was an expensive Airbnb in an expensive part of town. Dude was likely a professional who got paid professional wages and bought a nice ass house for 350k that\u2019s now valued between 800k and 1M. He\u2019s not poor, he\u2019s just a bad planner.", "Assuming they have their own room they have more privacy because the common areas of the house are only shared with family. \n\nIn a hotel the common areas are shared with a lot more people that are complete strangers. \n\nThe room in the Airbnb is likely around the same size as a hotel room would be.", "TBH, it seems like your dad got the expensive place **assuming** you'd all split the cost. When that didn't work out, he asked you to chip in, which you agreed to.\n\nYou said you'd pay for one night, so you should. The only alternative I can see-*IF he can get a refund*\\--is to start over w/everyone getting their own place, w/their own money.\n\nAnd next time, agree that everyone will make their own reservations!!", "YWBTA.", "NTA, but maybe you could compromise by reimbursing him the amount it would have cost to stay at a cheaper place of your choice.", "What AirBnBs are you staying in that have good cancellation policies? The vast majority of listings I see use either the firm or strict policies that require you to cancel more than 30 days out or less than 2 days after booking to avoid losing 50% of the cost.", "Unless OP and wife have their own bedroom *and ensuite bathroom*, that is not simply true. The bathroom being a common space is a huge downgrade.\n\nAlso, for most people, staying in a room in a shared apartment with family would not constitute more privacy than having your own hotel room and having to eat breakfast \"in public\" in the dining area (that's really the only common area at a hotel you have any reason to actually spend time in). In a shared apartment with family, you are expected to interact with them - even little things like talking a bit while you walk to the bathroom. There is no expectation of this with anyone at a hotel. \n\nYou can claim the couple can just stay in their room the entire time but 1: the family will likely find this rude, and 2: there are more amenities likely to be found in common areas at an airbnb than at a hotel, so you *have* to leave the room and will have to interact with family. Want to grab a drink from the fridge? Have to go out into the kitchen rather than staying in your hotel room and opening the mini fridge. Need to use the bathroom? Unless the airbnb has an ensuite, you have to go out into the apartment. You may also need to share a bathroom. Want to sit on the couch and watch tv together or do some work alone? There is likely no couch or desk in your bedroom like there would be in even a small hotel room. You have to go out into the apartment. You also can't wear whatever you want - you will have to look \"presentable\" and avoid looking inappropriate while you're around family and constantly walking into or through common spaces.\n\n\nAdditionally, the couple will probably have to keep quiet at night or may otherwise not feel as comfortable being intimate or speaking freely to eachother, as they are not fully \"alone\" (a bit of a psychological thing) and also sound is likely to travel more. \n\nAlso, regarding the one common space people are likely to use at a hotel: they can go down to the dining area at a hotel and have a private conversation and feel relaxed, as they are not obligated to interact with anyone else. In the airbnb, they will likely be expected to eat in the apartment with family. EDIT: Being around a bunch of people you can sit separately from and who don't know you and aren't paying attention to you is more private for a couple than the alternative. For example, two people can have  \"a nice dinner alone, just the two of us\" in a restaurant even though there are other people there, but they can't have \"a nice dinner alone, just the two of us\" at a dining table with their entire family. \n\nI personally think NAH, but it's a bit ridiculous to claim that the shared airbnb has more privacy. I don't think most people would agree with that. It\u2019s a very normal thing for people who live with others to get a hotel room for privacy.", "I don\u2019t think that would make you an AH. I\u2019d just take the time to explain to your dad, that whilst you appreciate the accommodation that he has chosen, it\u2019s not something that is within your budget at the moment, and if he can\u2019t afford to have you stay there without paying your own way, then you\u2019ll have to get your own accommodation for the wedding, that is more within your budget.", "YWBTA.  Your dad had the best of intentions; rubbing his nose in his financial woes would be mean.  It\u2019s a tough transition from family big-shot to retiree.  Be graceful.", "I think this is one of those cases where I\u2019d forget about what was technically correct.\n\nDid your dad end up making a different decision than you would have? Yes. Is that slightly unfair to you? Yes. Are there good reasons out of his control that have caused the financial change? It seems so. It also seems like you can afford the money to cover the 1 night, so the main issue is just you not getting your ideal accommodation at that price.\n\nI think if you like your dad and want to maintain a good relationship with him I\u2019d just pay and enjoy the trip. Especially if the Air BnB cannot be canceled.", "So you were fine with staying at the Airbnb in a nice part of town as long as you didn't have to pay for it?   But now that your father is a cash strapped you have an issue.  You said your self a hotel would cost the same as what you are being asked to pay. \n\nI think this falls under ESH", "I agree NTA, but sometimes to preserve relations and peace it can be worth it to take the short term financial loss. I\u2019d pay what he\u2019s asking and just kindly request going forward that before he booked anything with you all in mind, you get a say in the financials as this would have been outside the cost you normally would pay. Based on fathers sudden desire to be more cost conscious it may not be an issue in the future, but sometimes we need opportunities to set our boundaries.", "Pay what you would have paid at the AirBNB, and explain in a friendly manner that you will put up with the loss of privacy as a favour to Dad.", "I\u2019m going to Florida at the end of July and can cancel up to 24h in advance for a full refund, at a 3K ($ CAD) / week place. \n\nI agree that\u2019s a very good policy, but still!", "Nta", "NTA, and IMO book your own space that you would have gotten anyway. Your dad may have meant well, but he didn\u2019t consult with anyone and then tried to change the terms of the deal even after you agreed to it. That\u2019s not fair to you. Get a hotel and enjoy a nice time with your wife.", "NTA.\n\nHe's trying to change the rules.\n\nAND the rest of the family seems to hostile to y'all's boundaries.", "NTA. Tell him to cancel it and you can stay elsewhere.", "Nta. What does your brother say?", "YWBTA IF you refused to pay anything at all. HOWEVER, if you were willing to pay what you think it's worth to you then NAH.  If you pay full price then you'll have a nice time with your Dad who just wants to have everyone together, and doesn't know how to bring things up ahead of time.", "Then book your own spot! This is ludicrous. You want to stay with dad for FREE, because being autonomous wasn\u2019t an argument initially. Pay your way and stop crying.", "Exactly. Alle the NTAs are not wrong technically, but strangers on the internet have no connection to your dad and don't care about your interpersonal relationship. In my book, this would definitely be a situation where I would gladly pay a part (if I have a good relationship with my dad of course). I am guessing the dad has paid for accommodations and vacations for OP lots of times.", "Exactl!", "I just went to an airbnb that we checked in on the 26th but could cancel for a full refund before the 23rd.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedited to remove a word", "Then you got lucky and found a host using the \"flexible\" AirBnB policy. From my experience, most hosts pick one of the more restrictive ones.", "I assumed so! Grateful, hope it goes well. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffc\n\nHowever, in the post, the trip seems to be a few weeks away, so there might still be hope!", "I would have no issue having sex with my spouse at a hotel, and would probably feel too weird about it (even assuming the walls were thick enough or we could be quiet enough) at an AirBNB surrounded by family. Not saying they plan to do that but that\u2019s the most obvious test I can think of. Just vastly less true privacy in the family AirBNB compared to the alternatives.", "Yes, exactly! I mentioned that in my giant wall of text lol (sorry, I know it\u2019s nearly unreadable).\n\nSharing an apartment or house with a bunch of other people is inherently way less private than a hotel room. Even more so for a couple who may want to be intimate or spend any sort of time alone together."]}
