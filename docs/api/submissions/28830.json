They are very different people, but get on due to their history and proximity to each other in later life. My partner's friend has never been faithful to anyone , has cheated on everyone she has had a relationship , and in the case of her 20 year marriage was unfaithful many times. He since ditched her and she has been very active on the dating scene since despite having a long time lover. \n\nSo they went away on holiday together which I was a bit paranoid about , where beforehand my partner had botox in her face (as did her friend) false eye lashes put on that look like brooms (honestly at this age have a bit more decorum).\n\nAnyway AITA for calling out my partner as she had changed her lock screen from a picture of me (had been that picture for 7 months) to one of her 20 year old kids whilst on holiday? This was after admitting her friend was looking at dating apps whilst abroad which she played down as locality services popped up natives of the area although it would have also popped up same nationality as her that was visiting the island too . Her friend is addicted to dating apps.\n\nMy partner says she can't remember changing her lock screen, to which I said timing sucks, and it's not something you can do accidentally on an iPhone. She just says she can't remember doing it.\n\nIn her defence she kept the lock screen for weeks before she changed it back, when you'd think she would have changed it back on the flight back.

Changing her lock screen isn't a huge deal no matter what the context is, and she put her kids there.

Health issues? I would focus more on that). Try not to be accusatory if you bring this up, make sure to repeat that this concern is 100% separate from this fight and your insecurity. \n\nYou do seem to admit being insecure in the comments, good for you, gives you something to work with. Her friend is a shitshow, agreed. I think your issue is more of a \"you are the company you keep\" mentality you have, this just seems more as an overreaction to trigger a fight, discussion, whatever you want to call it, about that. It sounds like you either accept the fact that she will be in this friendship, or walk awa if it is a dealbreaker for you. If you want her to cut out this friend, it will likely be a losing battle.\n\nI mean, I do actually feel for you a bit, especially if this friend is somewhat stepping all over your partner's boundaries, and she is going along with that because she feels obligated, but that is really hard to know from your very narrow description of their dynamic.

Your gf's friend is single, a reputed cheater, who has and continues to actively pursue sexual relations/relationships, in public and dating apps.\n\n2. Your gf, presumably in an exclusive relationship with you and about to cohabit with you, decides to go on a \"holiday\" with her friend.  May I ask how far they travelled,  the nature of the place they visited, as well as how long?\n\n3. Before she leaves, your gf arranges to get botox.\n\n4. Before she leaves, your girlfriend gets fake eyelashes.\n\n5. After she leaves, and pretty much as soon as she is away from you on her alleged innocent \"holiday\", the photo of you on her phone screen is removed. And she doesn't know how it happened???\n\nI think you're entitled to know a lot more about that \"holiday\" as it sounds like an extended Bachelorette party in Vegas, where \"what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas\".\n\nCould all of this be innocent coincidence?  Yes, it could. But I sure as hell would like more information, like texts/receipts,etc. I see no need for you to apologize.  Your gf's collective actions created a spectre of possible actions/behavior by her that's not consistent with the commitment to a lifelong relationship. \n\nWhat was your gf doing  when \"Ms. Hotpants\" was cavorting on holiday? That's not an unreasonable assumption. I the meantime, what was gf doing--staying alone in her room? Give me a break.\n\nAdditionally, and I am not accusing, but rather asking, is it possible your gf is bi-sexual and has continued to have relations with her friend, while being with you? That would explain the continued relationship between two individuals who otherwise appear to be polar opposites.\n\nYou were prepared to enter a life-long commitment with your gf. Actions occurred which triggered red flags. Why does that mean you're insecure? Perhaps a better term is prudent!  I trust if you'd done similar things with a long-time male friend as your gf had, you'd face an inquisition. \n\nI believe your inquiries are reasonable; as your gf's behavior certainly was such as to warrant concern. Rather than insecure, I suggest you're not blind--not blind to events that gave you that deep gut feeling that something was amiss. My biggest regrets in life have been when I didn't follow my gut. You followed yours and have no reason to apologize to anyone for doing so.\n\nI know I'm unpopular with my response, but in my mind, you're NTA.  I believe your gf is TA for having caused this scenario. And given her response that she doesn't know how the screen face was removed, I say BULLSHIT.

I accidentally change mine at least once a month.", "My 7 month old daughter changed my Lock Screen the other day by randomly swiping and pawing at the screen, no idea how it happened but it did", "Yeah I accidentally change mine all the time. I hate that new \u201cfeature\u201d on the iPhone.", "This happens to me ALL the time!", "It\u2019s happened to me many times. I hate it when that happens", "This is so true! I'm a tech-savvy 29 year old and almost accidentally change mine all the time!", "There is a setting that cycles through pictures for your Lock Screen. I intentionally set up my iPhone to do that. Are you sure you didn\u2019t accidentally do so?", "Also, it's all assumption.\n\nNot sure why people downvote lol,\n\nThat doesn't change the fact the dude has no trust with his gf.", "Yes! This! Its literally done it in my pocket. So annoying", "Same! Do it at least once a week.", "I have had a serial cheater in my life since I was little. He is perfectly able to control his impulses but chooses his own happiness over him or his wife, wife x 2 wife x3, wife x 4, girl friends and mistresses. So no, I'm basing it on what I've seen and my understanding of selfish people doing exactly what they want to do to be happy. \n\nCheating is a choice, every single time, and that is not impulsive, it is calculated.", "No, it\u2019s seems to happen when you\u2019re on your lock screen too long without opening it? It\u2019s definitely not on a rotation of photos because it could stay the same picture for maybe a month and then change twice in the space of a couple of hours. \n\nAnd they\u2019re all pics I\u2019ve previously had as my Lock Screen so they\u2019re not random photos from my gallery.\n\nIt\u2019s a nuisance \ud83e\udd23", "I never said all women are alike   She brags about cheating You don\u2019t think your friends are a reflection of your values?", "If you hold your finger on the screen it will give you the option to change the photo on your Lock Screen. If you then swipe it\u2019ll put your previous lock screens on. It\u2019s easy to do accidentally", "Yes this happens all the time! It\u2019s so likely that OP\u2019s wife did it accidentally!"]}
