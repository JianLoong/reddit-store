You mentioned a diffuser so him getting you one shows he is listening and putting effort in (if it was random then no). For his mum and sister though, he\u2019s clearly just thought \u201cthey can have the same\u201d, which I don\u2019t think is weird, but is low effort. Would make more sense for them to be annoyed \ud83d\ude02", "NAH\n\nYou gave him the idea. He got it for you. He probably thought they were cool so he got extras for his mom and sister. it's not that big of a deal, especially if he's a guy that struggles for gift ideas.", "I find it a bit odd that he got all of you the same thing. However, he might just suck at gift giving. He heard you say you thought diffusers were cool and was probably like \"shit...I need to get my mom and sister something too. Bet they'd think these things were great too. They're also women.\"", "NTA. Your boyfriend is clearly lazy and not very thoughtful.", "All he got you for Christmas was a $20 diffuser? Yes, after 6 years I would think that he would be able to put more thought into your gift than a diffuser. However, you're focusing way too much on this being like his mom and sister thing. How is that even relevant? It's not like he got you all lingerie...That would be weird! And since you had mentioned that you were interested in a diffuser it seems more like he got you one and then decided to get them the same thing he got you. Not the other way around!", "Nta but he's lazy.", "NTA, he took the easy way out and made it weird. \n\nIdk.. he got you something you had mentioned you found interesting. It sounds like he took your suggestion and and went with the same thing for his  mom and sister. Now\u2026 if he has gotten you the same thing his mom or sister had mentioned, that would have been even worse. So at least you have that lol.", "He bought you what you asked for\u2026that you said you thought would be a great gift\u2026thus, he thought his Mom and Sister might enjoy it as well.

What he writes in his cards is our love language. I accept all crappy gifts with a sweet note. Yeah it's weird but not surprising. Be as direct as possible.", "NAH, leaning towards it though. It may just be me, but I find that any gift I get is one that I am grateful for. Don't read into something that is only surface level. \n\nI guarantee he didn't sit there looking at diffusers, dive into a complex algorithm in his head and decide that the three of yall are in the same category. He got you something you expressed interest in, and then thought the other girls in his life might like them too. Simple dude logic.", "NTA it's weird but you should tell him how you feel, people aren't mind readers and they can't change behavior if they don't know it bothers you", "Welcome to dating men with no imagination.", "NTA\n\nI'm guessing he did the work to figure out what you'd want and didn't want to bother to figure out something for his sister and mother so they got the same thing.\n\nJust talk to him about it being nice that he listened to you and got you a gift with so much thought behind it, but that you would feel more special if he didn't get the same things for the other women on his gift list.", "NAH. You\u2019re not wrong for feeling weird about it\u2014getting everyone the same thing smacks of \u201ccouldn\u2019t be bothered\u201d on his side of things. That said, I wouldn\u2019t call him an AH for it\u2026just a little thoughtless. Especially after six YEARS together!\n\nI would recommend talking to him\u2014not about last year\u2019s gift, not now\u2014start laying the groundwork for something more in line with what you\u2019re hoping for. If you make it clear you\u2019re hoping for something handmade, personalized, an experience to share, whatever, perhaps he\u2019ll keep that in mind. (I\u2019d suggest helping him find gifts for his mom and sister, but that way lies emotional labor you will NEVER ESCAPE.)", "Right so it isn\u2019t more that it\u2019s weird that he got you the same gift as his family it\u2019s more a cheap gift for 6 years?? I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the thought that doesn\u2019t count but you\u2019d think that maybe he\u2019d put a bit more effort into the gift altogether, nta", "Minor yta\n\nI mean sure, a little weird but is it really that big of a deal to be upset over. Idk, maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m a gay man who understands jack shit about women, but I just don\u2019t see the issue here. He may just not be very good at gift giving (which is thoughtless at worst and not AH behavior) or maybe this was something he thought other family members might want too, especially around that time of year. Idk, at one point I got my parents and sister an air fryer and thought my partner would also appreciate it, we all love them, I think it would be kind of odd for my partner to be upset that they got the same thing, especially a pretty common appliance(does a diffuser count as one? Lack of a better word ig) If this was like lingerie, make up or clothes then I\u2019d probably be more upset.", "Swimming against the stream... YTA. He gathered information on something you expressed interest in, and gifted you accordingly. He wasn't OBLIGATED to gift you at all.\n\nThere are almost no circumstances where being annoyed  about a gift is anything other than an AH move.", "[deleted]", "Depends. Would you have been bothered by this gift if your bf got his mom and sister a different brand/price diffuser?\n\nI don't really get the comments saying nobody is entitled to a gift... it's Christmas, the holiday of giving, and especially with your partner of SIX YEARS. Y'all are lying if you say you wouldn't be upset if your partner gave you a crisp high five and that's it lmao... Even a small tiny gift, an experience, or something handmade is better than absolutely nothing. It's not about entitlement, it's about being thoughtful and wanting to show love to your partner. \n\nYou specifically requested this as a gift for yourself and bf got it for them as well, which for you makes it less special to you. I get that! If anything I feel bad for his mom/sister for not getting something they'd want and just thought \"oh, my girl wants this so they'll like it too\". If that's how that went, I mean!\n\nNTA in how you feel. Bf kinda TA for being lazy for his family's gifts.", "NAH\n\nI think you're choosing a particular directionality where mom and sis come first. It's as likely to be the case that he picked your present and then thought it would also work for mom and sis.\nI find stupid that you're upset at a present you actually like.\n\nI would worry only if this was something he did often with your presents.", "Nah ..he's lazy lol", "NTA", "Christmas this past year! Lmfao I know.. I\u2019m thinking about gifts for this year and I just remembered this.", "That's what I was thinking, haha!\nNAH.", "It's just being lazy, really.

A diffuser is just a diffuser.", ">more a cheap gift for 6 years\n\nI don't think this has anything to do with it, or shouldn't anyway.", "Thank you. I find that being upset by the monetary cost of a gift or that it didn't 'feel special' is just petty IMO.", "I may be dating myself here, but there used to be commercials on TV that were \"a great gift for every woman/ man in your life\" type products, a diffuser would be one of those items. This is not a hill I would personally choose to die on.", "Principle", "So, almost a year ago? And you're still annoyed by it?", "What's the established requirement for gift giving?", "I appreciate this viewpoint thanks", "Yeah, the only time I think you're justified being upset is when the gift is clearly meant to be cruel or insulting. For example, giving a woman who's just miscarried a pair of baby shoes.", "I haven\u2019t really thought about it for 10 months, but because Christmas is coming up, it jogged my memory. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t bother me that much I just want to hear other\u2019s opinions", "Actually thinking about a gift that would be suitable for the recipient.\n\nHighly doubt that all three of them really wanted diffusers.", "My partner is the same. Together 17 years now and his complaining about not knowing what to get me for the holidays. \n\nI can understand feeling a little dissatisfied and disappointed. If he\u2019s otherwise a great person who routinely shows effort in the relationship, I would let it go. Maybe make a joke about it. \n\nI could be bias, though. I freaking LOVE diffusers \ud83d\ude0a", "You mean, the diffuser she expressed interest in? The one he gifted to her? \n\nI can entertain the laziness factor on behalf of mom and sister, but it seems like he thought about her first. \n\nI may just be an oddity among women, but I don't see much wrong with this.", "Yes, that one. Did his sister and mother express interest in it as well?\n\nOr did he just assume that since his gf wanted one that all women must want one?", "Nah. Some people find gift giving really hard, especially a lot of men in my experience. He probably thought if one of you liked it you all will. My partner gets the girl who works in the shop and knows me to choose it! But he would be completely lost trying to find something for me and I understand that about him. Not everyone feels the same about gift giving, I like to find a gift that makes them go wow but shopping is a chore for some of us. I would keep my mouth shut and appreciate the gift.", "Nobody is the asshole. \n\nI get you wanted to feel special but he got you an item you specifically wanted and enjoy having. \n\nYou will be the AH if you bring this up 10moths later and make a mountain of this ant hill. Its just not worth it. \n\nYour BF is being a bit of a thoughtless gift giver but also as I said he got you something you wanted and enjoy and saw the easy way to give the 2 other important women in his life the same enjoyable gift.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 of 6years is a useless gift giver. I specifically send him the link of things I would like multiple times and still he gets something random at the drugstore.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t care because he takes the bins put all year, hugs me when I am sad about going NC with family, buys tampons and chocolate if I ask and is my best friend in the whole world.", "NAH. It's not wired, just a bit lazy or stressed about what to get. I suspect his thinking process went something like-\n\n\"What do I buy? Ok, so GF hinted she wanted a diffuser. I've no idea what to get sis and mom. Hmm if GF likes the diffuser they probably will as well. Awesome I can get all three together.\"", "NTA and I get why you\u2019re bothered. It probably feels like you\u2019re all the same to him."]}
