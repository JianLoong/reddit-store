If in the U.S. and 65 or over, she could conceivably qualify for a Medicare plan that would cover everything, including making the cost of medications very low.  \n\nIt would be good if you or your aunt could talk with an insurance agent who specializes in insurance programs for old people.  That could perhaps solve this whole problem.\n\nMeanwhile, NTA for demanding that other solvent grandchildren kick in, and refusing to carry the load by yourself.", "I don\u2019t think it was that, I think this is all on my aunt holding me to one standard, but not the other grandchildren", "I brought that up too, but it was words falling of deaf ears", "I don\u2019t believe my aunt is pocketing the money.

This aunt seems to be jealous of you and probably wants to tarnish your reputation among your extended family. Watch out for what she says and does.\n\nAbout your grandmother, there is no point in sending her money after cutting out a sizable amount from what you earn. As sad as it is, your mom & her siblings need to figure out how to care for their mother", "The only other thing I can think of is a typical South Asian mentality where the oldest ones in every family/generation have to assume most responsibilities, and the younger ones get away mostly scot-free.

If it\u2019s $50 that translates to a decent amount in your home country, good!\n\nContinue sending the budgeted amount and don\u2019t entertain any conversations with this aunt about it anymore. It was never her business to question you anyway. NTA", "I was in a WhatsApp chat with my mom, two aunts, and the medical professional. Every month, the medical professional would post the invoice so I could see how it was divided.", "Thank you very much for this comment! This is definitely great advice!", "I don't wanna sound like a conspiracy nut, but is there a chance your brother actually is giving money to one of your relatives and they're keeping it quiet?"]}
