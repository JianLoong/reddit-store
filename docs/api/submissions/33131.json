{"id": 33131, "submission_id": "18jq4vx", "title": "AITA for cutting my innocent sister out of my life?", "selftext": "My (F23) parents split up after I was born when my dad was having affairs. Throughout the years my dad\u2019s barely been in my life. I grew up with my older brother living with my mum and her partner. My mum spent my entire childhood depressed, hardly leaving the bed/sofa and my stepdad was emotionally abusive, with physical threats. I looked after my younger sibling a lot. Things that never bothered me when I was young but do now in retrospect; I shared a box room with my siblings, I begged my mum to leave the relationship for 15 years, and overall I just wanted her to be better, we had less than anyone I knew did, and as so I had to work since I was 13, but I didn\u2019t mind until I think about my dad. My dad owns two very well businesses, built his own house, has his own land, the whole family are very well off and he went on to have another child, a girl. My dad never paid child support and saw us maybe once or twice a year, when he did call he\u2019d talk to my brother and not me so I never really had a bond with him. One thing that\u2019s always bugged me is seeing & hearing about his relationship with his other daughter, they\u2019re exactly how every father/daughter relationship should be, I\u2019ve seen vids/pics of them together, spoils her, she has her own Annex at the house and a brand new car for her 17th & the thing that gets me is he really helps her with her career which happens to be the exact same I always wanted growing up. I always did art shows growing up & he takes her to shows every year as an annual father/daughter bonding trip. And in fact the only time theyd contact me (her&her mother) was to ask me to help her with those things as I knew what it was like (I had to do this all on my own with never any help from them) but they are so supportive and helpful to her and use me to further it. Myself and my sister are so similar in looks and likes and though I\u2019d love to have a relationship with her I find it too difficult. I haven\u2019t seen either of them in 4 years now after an argument with my dad. My dad about a 2 years ago said he wanted to make amends but has only messaged me on Christmas and my birthday (which he gets wrong). Sorry I know I\u2019m ranting now but I know I\u2019ve ruined the relationship with my sister because of my jealousy, and I know it\u2019s a bad emotion to have but I can\u2019t help thinking she\u2019s had the life I could\u2019ve had. Even if I tried to salvage our relationship would I be the asshole if I said I\u2019m not sure if I want to? I know she\u2019s done nothing wrong but she\u2019ll never understand my upbringing and my view of our dad and I kind of don\u2019t want her to either, if she did and I told her I wouldn\u2019t want her to fall out and lose that relationship w her dad (if she did believe me). I\u2019d also have to get over my lifelong feelings of hurt and jealousy when I see her and I\u2019m not sure if I can, I\u2019d love to as I\u2019m getting older now but just unsure as to what to do. She now thinks I\u2019m just mean for not making more of an effort but I\u2019ve tried to make plans and she\u2019s always said she\u2019s busy, I messaged her last week and she still hasn\u2019t replied, so I might\u2019ve missed my chance anyway but Am I the asshole for feeling this way about someone who\u2019s done nothing wrong?", "created_utc": 1702729363, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18jq4vx/aita_for_cutting_my_innocent_sister_out_of_my_life/", "score": 7, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A strictly focused, grateful spirit can remove the sting from a lot of wrongs in life. It's a great way to change your thought patterns from focusing on the unfortunate things done to you, to celebrating what you've accomplished *while* experiencing hardships. The longer your list of good things in your life, combined with feeling grateful and proud of your own accomplishments despite difficulties and setbacks, the less room in your head there will be for jealousy of anyone. Then, with an open heart and mind, you'll be able to see that all that appears so perfect and lovely in your half-sister's world is something to be celebrated and it will no longer bring on pangs of jealousy.", "NTA, I\u2019ve thought about this situation a lot because I find myself in what I imagine is a similar situation to what your father would have been in 23 years ago.  First off, I can\u2019t imagine how he left your life the way he did, I could never not be a part of my daughter\u2019s life.  But if I had another daughter with another woman and stayed with that family, I anticipate that my first daughter would feel very much the way you do.  NTA because your hurt is reasonable, but I think that you have to decide what is going to make your life more happy and fulfilling.  Can you overcome your jealousy to have a relationship with a sister you seem to have a lot in common with and enjoy being around?  Sometimes we have to let go of animosity and negative feelings so that our lives can improve.  If you can\u2019t do that, can you live without having those relationships?  At some point you\u2019re going to need to make up your mind- I don\u2019t think either decision is necessarily right or wrong", "Nta none of this is your fault your father is a supreme ah", "She\u2019s a user, just like her parents. What woman is content with a man who does nothing for his children and cannot be bothered to see them? \n\nThey only contacted you when they needed something. She doesn\u2019t need you anymore so she is not available. She is not innocent, she is like the people who raised her. \n\nDon\u2019t have her in your life.
