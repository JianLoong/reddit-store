Big enough to cause a scene and make my dad and stepmom storm out after driving 8 hours to be there. My mother still thinks my stepmom should apologize for her actions. And in her defense, my dad and stepmom had been rude to her around the time of the event (which my mom told me back when I was a child) but they\u2019ve since corrected their behavior. My mother never expressed to them that she wanted an apology from them.\n\nThe thing is, I love my stepmother. She\u2019s been so sweet and caring to me and my sister, she\u2019s never treated us unfairly, is protective, and loves us like we\u2019re her own children. She means a lot to me and my dad. But because of my mother\u2019s perspective, she\u2019s quiet and meek when it comes to me or my sister\u2019s big milestones. \n\nMy mother speaks ill of my stepmom and sometimes my dad, she\u2019s got her whole large family on her side.

I felt that if my stepmom wanted to travel to come support us that she was within the right. \n\nRecently my mother stated that she didn\u2019t want my stepmom at my wedding. She went as far as to say that if my stepmom showed up, she would leave immediately. I was really hurt when she said that.

Though of course he wouldn\u2019t drive 8 hours and come without his wife, especially knowing how badly she wanted to come along. I told my mother then that I think she should heal from that instance. It was apparent to me that it was eating away at her and has been for years and I just felt like it kept coming out in the ugliest of ways. She often took offense that I was defending my stepmom at that time, and said her feelings were hurt by my \u2018indifference\u2019. Knowing my mother, her pain can be emotionally destructive.

Get your own opinion, because it is your story from the beginning. \n\nThat's said, from what your explain, your mother is painfully emotionally immature and at some point in adulthood you can decide that it should not be your burden to catter for her insecurities. \n\nYou've been blessed with a good stepmother that you love and consider, a stepmother who, if I understood, already had to refrain from certains experiences (milestones) she would have wished to share with you.\n your mother should be glad not only for you but for herself, if she have been able to let go of that thing, she would have consider her luck to be able to trust the co-parents, she would have some respect or even gratitude over the fact that stepmom did respect the boundaries she asked for. Instead she continue to berate her and your father ? \n\nI really feel like you should know the bottom of the story, to see if at one point that was making sense, or if it was your mother's insecurities who, from the beginning, started it and so spoiled a part of your childhood.", "I think it might be time to have an adult conversation with all three of them (not at the same time of course).

They don't interact on a gathering, but the will be there at the same moment and that is the part that counts", ">Ask your mom if her beef with your stepmom is really more important to her than being at her daughter's wedding\n\nThat's really the crux here. Mom wants to score a \"win\" by being the one OP picks. The wedding is just the arena - and the bride the tool to bring about victory.", "Yes to this. My paternal grandparents absolutely hated each other, and it had been at least a couple of decades since they had even been in the same postcode as each other. But when my dad got married, they were both warned that they had to at least be civil, if they couldn't be friendly, or neither of them would be attending. And bless them, they were decent and civil towards each other for that one day. It was the one and only time I ever seen both of my grandparents together in my lifetime, and I was grateful for their maturity, which made my dad so happy that day. They went right back to hating each other as soon as that day was over, but they understood that it was only for one single day. Its not really that hard.", "This post is 21 hours old, so you may never see my comment, but let me tell you a story: \n\nMy parents divorced when I was little, and I was raised by my mom in Texas. In high school, I started dating a guy whose dream it was to attend UNC. Guess where my dad and stepmother lived? North Carolina. And they agreed to house us if we moved there for college. We'd be dumb not to take them up on that offer. Moved up there. Stayed. Got jobs. Got engaged. \n\nSo this was 25 years ago. I was excited to be getting married to my (then) fiance. Planning a wedding is daunting, and I called my mother for help. We chatted, and then she laid down the ultimatum that if I invited my father, she wouldn't be coming. But how could I not invite him? He was the only family I had had for the past few years. \n\nI was devastated. \n\nAfter talking it over with fiance, we decided that if everyone couldn't come, then no one could come. And we eloped. \n\nAnd I have regretted it ever since. I should have chosen family. Because now I'm trying to recreate a little piece of that wedding bliss for myself in the form of a 25th anniversary vow renewal, but guess what? My mom passed away 13 years ago. After my mom passed away, two of my sisters and I stopped speaking to each other. My grandma can no longer make long trips. \n\nI can't get back what I could have had. I let one person's selfish demands influence what would have been one of the biggest days of my life. \n\nDon't make the same mistake.", "I have been you. My parents divorced when I was a baby and have hated each other for the past 40 years. \n\nInvite who you want. People who love you more than their own selfish hurt feelings will show up for you. People who have opposite priorities will either make a big stink and eventually get themselves uninvited or just not show up. \n\nParents who say shit like this are playing a high stakes game of emotional \u2018Dibs\u2019 on milestone events and it\u2019s unhinged. Get over yourselves parents and suck up your own bullshit for a day so your kid can have normal milestone celebrations without feeling like every single time is no-win scenario where other people\u2019s (childish and selfish) feelings are prioritized over theirs."]}
