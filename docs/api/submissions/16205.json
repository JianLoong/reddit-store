Big enough to cause a scene and make my dad and stepmom storm out after driving 8 hours to be there. My mother still thinks my stepmom should apologize for her actions. And in her defense, my dad and stepmom had been rude to her around the time of the event (which my mom told me back when I was a child) but they\u2019ve since corrected their behavior. My mother never expressed to them that she wanted an apology from them.\n\nThe thing is, I love my stepmother. She\u2019s been so sweet and caring to me and my sister, she\u2019s never treated us unfairly, is protective, and loves us like we\u2019re her own children. She means a lot to me and my dad. But because of my mother\u2019s perspective, she\u2019s quiet and meek when it comes to me or my sister\u2019s big milestones. \n\nMy mother speaks ill of my stepmom and sometimes my dad, she\u2019s got her whole large family on her side.

She went as far as to say that if my stepmom showed up, she would leave immediately. I was really hurt when she said that.

You do whatever you want, and if your mom can't ignore/be polite to someone for one day, I think it shows the extent of her love for you.\n\nUnless your stepmom did something truly horrendous and criminal to your mother, she can get over it and be civil in everyday life, and more so be in the same room to support you on one of your big days.\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA. It sounds like she loves this fight with your stepmom more than she loves you.", "NTA. Invite both and if your mother does not come that is completely her decision, not yours. And do not let her blackmail you by trying to blame you for her decision to not come. If she does come, you need to have a friend briefed and ready to escort her out if she picks a fight.", "\u201cMom, you can put aside your differences for one day. It\u2019s my wedding and you should do nothing but support me.\u201d Nta", "I would let your mother read what you wrote here.  You express your feelings in a very fair manner and are understanding of your mothers feelings.  It is time she do the same for you.", "NTA. But having said that, there are some transgressions that a person should not be expected to get past. Without knowing what happened and why, it\u2019s impossible to know if it\u2019s reasonable to bring them all together. It\u2019s your wedding, you get to decide who you want to invite. But realize your mom is her own person, she has a right to establish her own boundaries and if she elects not to be in the presence of your step mother, she has a right to that decision. She also has a right to her feelings about the situation. You don\u2019t have to agree. You need to find out what actually happened and whether or not there can be a mediation. If apologies are owed, they should be offered and amends made. If anybody\u2019s safety was ever in question, this may not be possible.", "Nta my grandma wouldn't be in the same room as my grandpa (her ex) and his wife. Granted he cheated on her with thr new wife, so she had AMPLE reason to dislike them. But the reality of it was that she missed a lot of events bc both were invited.  \n\nYou need to nip this *now*.  Or else your mom is going to pull this same shit at every event.", "NTA\n\nTell your mom you are sad that her hatred  for your stepmom is stronger and bigger than her love for you. The only thing that should matter to her on your wedding day is to make it the best day for you.", "NTA. If your mom\u2019s hate of your step-mom is more important than her love for you, she needs to get over whatever ever nonsense she\u2019s clung to all these years.", "NTA. It's time to tell your mother she's free to choose her hate of another woman over the love for her own child. It sucks and it'll hurt, but you'll get over her choosing to skip your wedding. You're not going to force her to be near a person she viscerally hates, but you'll always invite both of them to all your new family's big events, so that means missing every and all future milestones in your life. \n\nIf your mother indeed wants to miss your wedding, there's nothing you can do. If she's bluffing, she's never attempting that on you again and will play nice.", "NTA  I had both my parents, who hate each other, not only come to my wedding but be in a photo together with me. I love both of them and they sucked it up for me.", "NTA but you'll just have to accept that your mom won't be there if your stepmom is", "NTA\nAsk your mom if her hate towards your stepmom really is bigger and more important than her love for you. Because that is what this sounds to me", "NTA the thing is if you give an ultimatum you've got to be prepared for the fall out, so your mum needs to understand that if she keeps pushing and can't accept that your SM is part of your life and important to you and you want her there that she herself may not be at your wedding.\n\nIf you don't really know why it all kicked off how can you say if it was just a misunderstanding, if it turned out your dad had cheated on your mum with SM would you feel the same.  Not saying that's what happened at all, you also say that your dad and SM corrected their behaviour, so they must have done something if it warranted behaviour being corrected, no? And if they had to adjust their behaviour perhaps there is something they did that they should have apologised to your mum for!?  \n\nThough I  don't think it warrants all of this drama, she can just not interact with her.", "NTA - You got the story from your mother about what happened when you were a child, and they were the ones who is causing all the issues for the last couple of years. I would say that chances are she is the one who caused the issues when you were a child, manipulated the story so you would side with her, and is upset that you have a mind of your own and actually care about your step-mother. Call her on her bluff. Say that if she is unable to act like an adult and civilized for the sake of her daughter, then you are glad that you will have one mother at your wedding who actually cares about you.", "NTA. Your mom did her best to alienate your dad and step mom, sounds like they didn't do anything wrong. You said yourself they were rude to your mom, but that's just what she told you? After all these years she's still very bitter you have another loving mother figure in your life and she's still trying to ruin that. It's your day, not hers, she doesn't get to decide.", "Invite people who you feel deserve to be invited. It\u2019s your wedding. People who choose not to attend are beyond your control.", "Absolute emotional blackmail.  If you don\u2019t stand up to her now, think down the road when you have kids.  Every event, holiday, birthday, etc will have drama.  \n\nNip it in the bud now, or live with it forever..", "NTA.  \nIf you mom want to walk out of your wedding, so be it.  \nYour stepmom was able to set aside their feud for the sake of you and your sister. Your mom put her hatred above your own wish and happiness. If she really walk out of your wedding, you'll know how much she really care about you.", "NTA. Tell your mom that if she's going to prioritize a years-old fight over your freaking wedding, she's well within her rights. Tell her that if that's the decision she makes, she doesn't get to complain about the consequences to her choice: your stepmother will have to fill the role of mother of the bride(speeches, dances, photos, etc). Her choices are either step up and put her feelings aside for a few hours for her own kid, or step out entirely so you're not worried about a brawl at your own damn wedding.\n\nYou can use this opportunity to set new boundaries. Let her know that from here on out, you don't want to hear about her complaints that pertain to your father's family unit. Flat out ask her how she'd feel if she found out your dad was talking crap about her but you never spoke up to stop him from doing so. To enforce that boundary, you either hang up or stand up and leave the room the second she starts badmouthing the people you love.", "NTA. It's your wedding, you invite who you want to be there, and it's up to them to behave like adults. It is not your job to referee your mother's emotions.", "NTA. You should absolutely invite your step mother to your wedding. She's someone you love, and she's a big part of your life.\n\n\nYour mom sounds like a narcissist. It's YOUR wedding, not hers. I would be very direct with your mom. Tell her that step mom will be at the wedding. She can play nice for ONE day. If she can't behave like an adult, she will be asked to leave.", "Absolutely correct!\n\nTell your mom \"All of my life you have attempted to dictate the terms of my relationship with my stepmom and my dad.  STOP!  I am an adult and I will decide what my relationship with them will be and it has nothing to do with you any longer.  Whatever has happened between all of you in the past, is not my problem and no longer my concern.  It is my wedding and I want them there.  If you do not love me enough where you can be an adult and control yourself on one of the most important days of my life, then don't come.  I only want people there that love and support me, and from the way it sounds, that isn't you!\"\n\nI know you want them all there, but you need to realize that you cannot force anyone to do anything.  You can only lay out the expectation and hope they adult enough to put their own personal crap aside to support their child.  Sounds like Mummy can't do that.  So you need to decide who is more important to you to be there - Mom or Dad.  Stepmom sounds like she is gracious and has been your supporter all along- she could and probably would step into the Mother-of-the-bride role and be that rock that Mom's are supposed to be during a wedding.  Your mom can't put aside her personal animosity and support you, do you really need her there?  Do you need the aggravation of trying to appease your mom, as you have done all of your life?\n\nI wish you well and I hope you update us on what you do!\n\nYou are NTA!", "Exactly. You invite both and if mom doesn\u2019t want to go because someone else is there, then that\u2019s her problem. By not coming she would state that the argument with the stepmom is more important than her daughters wedding. Sad.", "Nothing\u2019s been planned yet, so no funds have been determined yet. :)\n\nThe disagreement was a big misunderstanding on both ends. It\u2019s mostly he-said-she-said and I only heard it from my mother\u2019s perspective so I can\u2019t defend my dad and stepmom as it wouldn\u2019t be fair. Not to mention I was young at the time and my mother selectively chose what to tell me and my sister back then. (Honestly felt like she was doing her best to antagonize them but I digress; she has her reservations that are still unknown/forgotten to me) \n\nWhen my sister and I graduated my mother said she didn\u2019t want my stepmom to come and was planning on just inviting my father. Though of course he wouldn\u2019t drive 8 hours and come without his wife, especially knowing how badly she wanted to come along. I told my mother then that I think she should heal from that instance. It was apparent to me that it was eating away at her and has been for years and I just felt like it kept coming out in the ugliest of ways. She often took offense that I was defending my stepmom at that time, and said her feelings were hurt by my \u2018indifference\u2019. Knowing my mother, her pain can be emotionally destructive. So it\u2019s been hard to properly talk to her without her initiating her defenses.", "This is a good way to put it. I\u2019ll have to give it a shot. Thanks.", "Great idea.", "I was the mum in  a similar situation and had to deal with the fact that (quite rightly) my son wanted his father to be at his wedding, soon after we had a very nasty divorce.  My solution to coping with this was I bought a very big hat.  Whenever my ex came into my field of view, I tilted my head and just edited him out of the surroundings with the large brim.  We managed to stay polite but distant the whole day.", "\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c", "Thanks, needed to hear this.", "I know I\u2019d have to respect my mother\u2019s decision but I\u2019m ngl I would probably go no contact with her if she actually left. She\u2019s entitled to protect her peace, and in fact I encourage it, but we already have a lot of pre-existing tension over (mostly) unrelated issues. If she made a scene at my wedding I\u2019d have a very hard time forgiving her.", "Thanks for your input! \n\nYou\u2019re right, my individual relationships with them both can affect the other person, but I always believed it isn\u2019t my conflict to resolve. \n\nI don\u2019t remember much and I only ever heard my mother\u2019s side, so if I explained my limited knowledge of the argument it would be he-said-she-said. But I know it was a big misunderstanding that I personally feel like they all should have handled better at the time, only my mother is the one still holding the grudge. And again, she never communicated that she wants an apology from them, yet she still expects one. I remember she said something like \u201cShe can\u2019t come until she gives me an apology\u201d.\n\nMy mother\u2019s feelings are hurt that I never completely took her side, and I respect her distance from my stepmom. However her adamant refusal to entertain the idea was deeply hurtful to me and she KNOWS it. In the end, I\u2019M the one whose hurt most over it, and I feel like I\u2019m supposed to pick up all the pieces.", "Parents were never married; they went their separate ways when I was young, about 7-8ish. My mom moved me and my sister out of state closer to her family and my dad stayed where he met my stepmom. I have a lot of repressed memories from that time so I can\u2019t say for certain who started what. But they were in a pretty bad spot when they broke it off, a lot of it was financial I believe.", "I disagree. I've been in this situation with a very extreme background trauma and I could still handle my own feelings for a day.", "OP, this is the response you need to navigate the emotional blackmail you are facing. Good luck to you, and Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials!!", "Well stated.", "You said that the disagreement has nothing to do with you, but then you started with the information that it occurred at an event of yours (a birthday ?) when you were a child. So you are involved in many ways in that argument and being an adult now it could be healing to go to the bottom of it, ask your dad and stepmother's side on the story, get a wider perspective on the subject.  Get your own opinion, because it is your story from the beginning. \n\nThat's said, from what your explain, your mother is painfully emotionally immature and at some point in adulthood you can decide that it should not be your burden to catter for her insecurities. \n\nYou've been blessed with a good stepmother that you love and consider, a stepmother who, if I understood, already had to refrain from certains experiences (milestones) she would have wished to share with you.\n your mother should be glad not only for you but for herself, if she have been able to let go of that thing, she would have consider her luck to be able to trust the co-parents, she would have some respect or even gratitude over the fact that stepmom did respect the boundaries she asked for. Instead she continue to berate her and your father ? \n\nI really feel like you should know the bottom of the story, to see if at one point that was making sense, or if it was your mother's insecurities who, from the beginning, started it and so spoiled a part of your childhood.", "I think it might be time to have an adult conversation with all three of them (not at the same time of course). There is clearly a lot of emotion around whatever this situation was and while for the most part I agree with other people\u2019s relationships not affecting our own, there are lines in the sand for everyone (or should be). \n\nIf I were you, I would want all the details around the situation. Adultery? Assault? Money? Who knows? But if I were you, I would want to and then act accordingly.", "I'm sorry you're going through this.  Good luck.", "I completely understand that and it falls under \"accepting consequence\". What I meant by my comment was that eventually we all have to accept that we can only control ourselves and nobody else- I have cousin who I absolutely refuse to be in the same room with (he is an abuser and groomer, the fact that he was never imprisoned changes nothing in my eyes). He was invited to my other cousin birthday, I refused to attend and our relationship suffered- which I'm not happy about but I accept as consequence of my actions.", "Please make it clear to your mother that if she causes a scene on YOUR special day, you will go no contact.", "How come you've only heard your mother's side? Have you never asked your stepmom about it?", "Did he met your stepmom there or did they your parents went separate ways because he met her when your mom and him were still in a relationship. It can also be that they went separate ways for whatever reasons and your mom was still in love with your dad and was angry he moved on or your mom just can't stand her for a different reason. \n\nWhatever happend is between your parents but I personally would ask my mum straight if the fight they had is the actual reason she hates your stepmom. That's me. It's your decision how much you want to know and how much you want to involve yourself.", "Very ignorant opinion, not everyone handels such things the same", "I agree with this. In some cases, such as if there was an assault I would not force the victim to be around the other person. \n\nBut in most other instances, your mother should be able to at least temporarily put it aside for a special event such as this for your benefit. Even if it can't be resolved fully, they don't have to like each other but can be civil and ignore each other.", "It's funny to assume mom would care if OP went NC. She'd probably just blame the stepmom & turn most of her side against OP. I mean, this woman is hurt over a misunderstanding & acting like a toddler.", "Probably because their Mum was the only one toxic enough to emotionally dump on a child.", "My dad and stepmom have never mentioned it. I don\u2019t think they know that I knew there even was an argument. I avoid the topic with them because it feels misplaced, they just don\u2019t talk about my mom unless they needed her permission to do stuff with us. But since I became an adult there\u2019s been less of that.", "Honestly i have no idea the exact time my dad met my stepmom, I just know it was after we left the state. I doubt my stepmom was in the picture when my dad and mother were still living together, though there\u2019s a lot that I\u2019m sure they haven\u2019t told me. And honestly I don\u2019t think I want to know. It was enough of a painful period in my life as is.\n\nAlso, my mother hasn\u2019t had any feelings for my dad at all since they split. When she left the state, she left their relationship, too. Now my mom and dad are cordial but nothing more than that. If it\u2019s jealousy she\u2019s feeling, it\u2019s not over my father.", "Yeah but a wedding day is not about you. I think it's pretty gross if a parent is willing to miss their own child's wedding because of an old grudge.", "I think it's pretty clear that your mom is nursing a grudge in a very unhealthy way. That being said, I also get the feeling that you're burying your head in the sand a bit here. It certainly sucks that you're being put in this position, but you could help bridge this gap and mend some fences before the wedding. Maybe sit them down together (via Zoom or whatever) and try to sort it all out. If your mom is still unreceptive, then you have your answer.", "I don\u2019t think your mom is right for any of her actions or dictating the terms of your relationship. \n\nI do think however that there is some nuance hear that you are missing if your mom is so quick to be upset with your stepmom, yet is on cordial terms with your dad. \n\nI would dig a little deeper into that question, because the loving, caring person that you know, may not be who your mother has experience."]}
