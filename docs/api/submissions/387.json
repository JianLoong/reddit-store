Sounds like they were kinda mean to you when you were younger and they were still growing up. Now that they\u2019re older I\u2019d give them a chance to be good sisters. If they get their act together it would be great to try and forgive them and repair the relationship. It could be great to have some sisters to have fun with!", "INFO: can you provide some specifics, like what made you angry, what they do to mistreat you, how you react?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What is it going to do? Bite your hand or cower in fear?   If your sisters are mean to you all the time, what do they expect you to do? Just be all happy sunshine and roses?", "sure. so they basically avodeid every contact with me, i would go to them to spent time with me, hug them and they would jest tell me something like 'get off me, you're annoying' or some shit like that and the would always judge me on everything, as if I knew something. they didn't have patience at all. this effected me till this day, cause now I have anger issues and i don't know how to deal with people or how to approach them correctly.", "What it sounds like to me is you and they are and have been in very different stages of life. They were moody and stroppy teens when you were a child who wanted to be close them. Now they are adults, have realized at least on some level their behavior was wrong and they want to reconnect with you but now you're a teenager going through your own emotions and struggles. I'm gonna go NAH but more importantly I suggest you listen to your feelings on the matter, they are valid and they shouldn't be ignored ask your sisters to give you space and time. I find a lot of family drama tends to die out when you become an adult in your mid and late 20s, obviously not all drama some is more serious and long lasting which might be the case here but I can't say, things that seemed so important as a teenager stop mattering as much. Also if you truly do feel like you have anger issues beyond what is normal for someone your age I suggest you speak to your parents about getting counseling for it, its a big step (and a very mature one) to recognize you have an issue like that but now the next step is getting help to express that anger in a healthy manner.", "thank you very much!"]}
