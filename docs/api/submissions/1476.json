If it is based on usage, and you didn't use any, then I don't see how you owe. If, however, it's averaged over the year, then I think you are stuck with paying. \n\nProvisionally NTA", "YWBTAH if you don't pay it, unless you made an agreement with them prior to exclude rent and/or other reccuring payment on extended absences. If your rental agreement to each other was to pay 1/3 of everything, then it shouldn't matter that you were gone. \n\nBut on a separate note, you may want to discuss with them why the bill was so high with only 2 of them there and if it's important to you, how to lower the utility bills by conserving energy & water.", "YTA if you don't pay. Many electricity costs are the same whether one person is in the house or multiple people are. Unless you pre-arranged something with them, it's an AH move to leave them in the lurch.\n\nIf you have a valid reason to think the bill is unusually high as compared to other months, you can question the amount, but that should be a *question* not an *accusation*", "NTA, but you should pay your share unless you have an agreement beforehand. So, for utilities, there are still costs that are accumulated when a house is completely vacant, such as heating or cooling. So, even if I am on vacation, I still need to turn on heat in the winter because I can\u2019t let my pipes burst. Now, breaking down the minutia of how much you owe for maintenance cost vs their fair share is too complicated unless you have an agreement beforehand.\n\nFor internet, I still have to pay my full internet bill even when I am away. \n\nanother thing to consider is that the billing cycle of some bills are delayed. the bills that are arriving now are the costs that we\u2019re probably accumulated while you still lived in the shared space.\n\npart of getting roommates is negating costs of bills, so it is unfair to shirk these responsibilities unless there is an agreement made otherwise. the default is that they are split evenly.\n\nNext time, talk to your roommates before you take extended leave to see if they would agree to split the cost differently.", "YWBTA if you don't pay. If the agreement is splitting utilities, split utilities. You wouldn't change the split because someone works from home while another person has to leave the house or if someone goes on vacation for a week. Electric prices are increasing and a lot of the home electric usage isn't necessarily caused by a specific person doing something but more general living in a house.", "Pay your share.  You owe it whether you were there or not.  YWBTA if you didn\u2019t pay.", "Well, we\u2019ll put it this way.\n\nI own a house. If I go on a trip for a month, do I get to default on my mortgage and utilities by not paying them for a month and get to tell my mortgage and utility company to just fuck off because I haven\u2019t been home in a month?\n\nNope. Doesn\u2019t work like that. You still have to pay your bills.\n\nYTA if you refuse to do that.", "Tbh if they\u2019re asking you to pay electricity while you\u2019re not there for a whole month, then I expect you should do the same. So if they\u2019re away for a month, I expect they Venmo you for internet & electricity.", "NAH since you are asking and genuinely don't know. But you should pay it because:  \n\n\n1. You agreed to when you moved in and there was no expectation you'd be gone for a whole month\n2. A lot of the bill is probably fees and taxes and the cost of keeping the electricity on every month\n3. Not paying it would probably lead to people trying to split everything differently, saying they were out for 4 days, etc. and that is a huge hassle", "Appliances use electricity even if you aren\u2019t using them. Not to mention the house in general uses electricity if you are there or not. You can\u2019t just not pay because you were out of town", "\u2b06\ufe0f Aaaaaand there it is. This is the logic OP needs to learn.", "Ok thank you for your input, it was very thorough and well said. I just paid her. Thank you.", "You outline very good reasons why OP should still have to pay, but then say OP wouldn\u2019t be an AH if they refuse to pay - makes no sense.  OP \u2026 YTA if you don\u2019t pay.", "And on top of that there is usually a base cost to those bills, like, even if you used zero electricity for a month, the bill wouldn't be zero. I could be wrong but where I like that's definitely the case with the water bill, you pay for the infrastructure and got having the service.\n\nOn top of that, OP, bills are always cheaper when split between more people, as in, three people do not use three times the power of one person. So, if you way, hey, I wasn't there and I didn't use anything, then even if that's true, your housemates still end up paying more for what they used, which they never agreed to", "Fair enough. Like I said, never been in that situation."]}
