The tickets aren't free though and individually they don't cost too much but over all it would be too much for me to cover without my family members sending me the money first. My Grandma thinks that I should be paying the fee rather than asking family to pay for their tickets if they want to attend. \n\nThe problem is that I owe my Grandma money because I had to borrow some to cover rent after being messed around by a piece of shit boss. I'd paid most of it back before asking her if it'd be possible for her to lend me the money for an ebike to commute because in the job I was in I was sometimes paying \u00a3400 a month to commute (the job finished late and I had to get taxis home and wanted to cycle instead but I'mnot fit enough to cycle 15 miles unassisted, some months I wasn't even breaking even on rent/bills/commute let alone food). \n\nSo these last few months I've not been able to pay her back, I've managed to find a new job closer to home that I can commute on the ebike easily or get the bus for if the weather is too bad. But my quarterly rent (which she knew about) was due and the quarterly rent is more than what I earnt in the first month at this new job and bills and food mean yet again  I don't have anything left. I could probably pay her back next month but that leaves absolutely nothing for Christmas presents and she's always been very judgemental of me and my brother struggling to be able to afford Christmas presents despite the fact I've been paying for them myself since I was 13.\n\nI think the part that frustrates me the most is that I'm not the only family member who owes her money and I've been honest with my situation with everyone and with the fact that I don't even have enough money to visit right now. My brother owes her money from ages ago, my Uncle has owed her money for as long as I can remember, but she doesn't put as much pressure on either of them to pay her back as she does me, and I don't think she properly understands the way the cost of living crisis has hit me as she barely even buys her own groceries anymore as she almost always eats with or gets left overs from relatives etc and thats yet another part of life that is draining me. I want to pay her back, I feel awful knowing I owe her money, I even got a second job which is really draining me in the hopes of paying her back. In the end I've had to put out the money for most of the relatives anyway as they haven't paid before the deadline for booking tickets and I asked for them to send the money through only for her to remind me that I still owe money. AITA? I want my family at my graduation but its becoming difficult to afford.", "created_utc": 1667211546, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yi7c7r/aita_for_insisting_my_family_pay_for_their_own/", "score": 13, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s not making sense to be honest. I think it\u2019s fair that anyone who wants to attend pays their own ticket. If anyone asks you about having to pay, remind them that you are just graduating and can\u2019t afford to pay for all the people who want to go (I would even go so far as to list everyone, e.g. I cannot afford to pay for Steve, Billy, Max, Mike, Lucas, Dustin, Elle, Robin, Nancy, Joyce, Hopper, Will, Jonathan, Mr Clarke and Alexei, so the only fair way I can have everyone attend is for each to pay their own way).", "NTA, you owing your grandma money doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re obligated to spend your money how she wants you to spend it. It would be reasonable of her to ask that you pay for HER ticket, but not everyone\u2019s tickets.

Don't invite them to the next occasion.\n\nStop comparing your situation to your uncle and brother. They are irrelevant. Is it unfair - maybe. But it isn't your business. Pay Grandma back with any spare money when you can.\n\nWhat you can do though, is let your family and friends know that you wont be doing Christmas this year.

My brother and uncle have never been good with money and I think she's worried I'm going to end up the same while I'm just doing what I can to keep my head above water for now. I'm hoping that, as the next few rent installments are less than this one that I can pay her back based on the difference. I've also said not to get me anything for Christmas and my birthday until I've repayed her too.

I made it clear that she could say no. I thought things were going to be looking up at the time but then my grocery bill sky rocketed in price. But I understand that I probably shouldn't have borrowed the money for the bike and would probably change it if i could now. I haven't borrowed any since even though I nearly missed the quarterly rent. I'm just a little frustrated that my uncle owes her 10x the amount I do and still gets treated like her golden child.

I do see how this comes across as whiny though. If it helps I am planning on using the bike to do deliveries to earn more money but there's a waiting list in my area to get onto uber and deliveroo and I've been working 48 hours a week to try and get to a point of being able to pay her at the same time as the quarterly rent.

I lived in a very very sketchy place with a slumlord. When it rained I couldn\u2019t turn on the lights bc water pooled in the light fixtures (he said it was condensation rofl)...and that was one of the better issues. The dealer across from me. I think I was the only person on the street who didn\u2019t buy from him. Here\u2019s the thing though...it sucked. It sucked a lot. But at the end of the day...it was the choice I made to be able to pay my debt. I worked a minimum of 48 hrs a week and went to nursing school 40 hours a week. Once I graduated I worked 60 hrs a week to make as much money as possible. I worked every holiday for double pay. It was hard. BUT...I paid off my car. I paid off my CC debt. AND I saved enough money for a down payment on a house outside of town in a nice neighborhood. (It was a foreclosure so almost half the price it was worth) At the end of the day it doesn\u2019t matter who granny wants her money from first or second. It\u2019s her money you borrowed. (For a good reason but none the less...her money.) Life sucks sometimes and there is no way around it. Look for govt assistance. Do you qualify for a food allowance? Are there food pantries you can get a box of food at? I know you can\u2019t \u201cafford food\u201d but seriously can you afford rice and beans? Dried rice and beans you cook yourself? What about ramen noodles? Hot dogs aren\u2019t the best but they are cheap. A single person could eat for about $10 a week if they had to...or less.", "Thanks, I'm doing everything I can to get to that better point, I just wish it'd get here already and that I felt stable financially.", "I've not asked for anymore money? Only that they pay for the ticket of they wish to attend. Attendance isn't mandatory and I never said so.", "I don't qualify for government assistance, I've checked, government support for young working adults without children is bad here. I'm eating as cheaply as I can but every item in the supermarket has gone up in price by at least 10p. I went to a food pantry last month but unfortunately the box they gave me was mostly filled with foods I can't eat (lactose, gluten, and salicylate allergy). I did get some good fresh veg and froze some of that and made a few good veggie dishes and some rice and lentils and rice noodles which has been good. (I swapped the rest if the food with a housemate so at least there's that, they don't let me go hungry but I refuse to be a burden on them so avoid them paying for food as much as possible)."]}
