Your sister may just be that clueless that you have to spell it out for her.", "NTA. She called you to ask you to get in the middle of it. You just didn't defend the person she wanted you to.

Keep doing what your doing at being a great uncle to Elizabeth.", "NTA. As the one who's always been excluded or not counted (not bc of sexual orientation. I'm sure that would've made it even harder, knowing my family)  I sympathize with your niece. I wish I had had someone stand up for me. One day, too many lines had been crossed and I blocked my mother- from my life. Permanently it was honestly something I should've done years before. I went from being the black sheep to even more of a black sheep. We spoke a few times on her death bed. I just wish she'd realized the error of her ways before that. It's been 8 years and I'm still the black sheep but I stand by my decision. Hopefully your sister and niece don't end up like that.", "NTA, she wants no involvement of yours yet she wants 'you' to talk to her daughter.

Thank god she has you", "NTA if she wants you to stay out of the relationship then don\u2019t call and ask you to talk to the child she just publicly humiliated.\n\nHer parents don\u2019t want her because she isn\u2019t a boy.

Thank you for being there for your niece. Her parents are horrible and especially her mom, your sister not for posting the pic, but for her caption. Why is she so shocked that Elizabeth removed her everywhere. I would too if I were her. \n\nIs there a reason why your sister and her husband dislike their own daughter so much?\n\nAlso the audactiyyyyy of your sister to ask you why she was removed, you then giving her an honest answer and then her being pissed off at you?? What? Like what is her issue she asked you why and you told her. I hate people like her. Don\u2018t ask if you can\u2018t handle it.", "Wow... NTA!!!", "nta that's awful", "NTA. \nShe called you asking for you to talk to HER daughter then gets pissed off and tells you to stay out of her business... which SHE MADE YOUR BUSINESS.

I mean, saying \"whole family\" but leaving out the daughter is a dick move.\n\nOTOH, ***use your words***.

You're a grown ass, middle-aged ***~~wo~~***man, talking to a practical senior-citizen.  The fact that you can't use clear words to talk to each other is...mutually asshole conduct.
