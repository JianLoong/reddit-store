I guess maybe I should say I pronounce it in a unique way. There\u2019s 2 different ways to say it depending on how you pronounce the vowels. The way my family has said it my entire life is different than what it looks like. If a person hears me say my name, they\u2019ll spell it wrong. But if they read my name, they\u2019ll say it wrong. \n\nNormally I really don\u2019t care. I genuinely could not care less if anyone says/spells my name right. I\u2019m not gonna lose sleep over it. \n\nHowever, I\u2019ve run into a lot of issues with this in my career. At my last job I was left off of several emails because my supervisor was spelling my name wrong. I had legal documents with my name misprinted. My name was spelled wrong on my mailbox, they even gave me a coffee mug with my name spelled wrong. It was really irritating. I\u2019ve realized over time that it\u2019s much easier for people to remember how to spell my name correctly, if they say it the opposite way than I normally do. So when I started my new job, they said my name with the different pronunciation and I just went with it. Everyone in my office calls me by this new pronunciation now and I kind of like it. I haven\u2019t had any issues with the spelling. A lot of other people in my life have said it this way regardless if I correct them or not, so it\u2019s not a huge adjustment for me. \n\nBut my friend has an issue with this. She says I\u2019m an asshole for basically faking the first thing anyone knew about me. She said I\u2019m straight up lying. I guess I kind of am but I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s that big of a deal.

It\u2019s your name, and you\u2019re allowed to make the choices about which battles about it are worth fighting.

My father worked 50 years in the public service going by his initials. My brother gets called \"chef bob\" at work, completely unrelated to his name.  \n\n\nYour colleagues at your old job are kind of the asshole for not learning your name properly.

I have a friend who does a similar thing. She's not ashamed of her name, but just can't be bothered with the hassle of people getting it wrong all the time. I think as long as you don't outright lie if challenged on it, you are fine.", "NTA - you can just decide to \u201cchange your name\u201d but essentially just change the pronunciation. It\u2019s not a lie any more than someone who legally changes their name or goes by a nickname. You can totally decide what people call you.\n\nPOV - I also have a name that is often spelled wrong when said correctly or said wrong when spelled correctly. It\u2019s a nightmare, and while I\u2019ve never gone as far as telling people that my name is the wrong pronunciation, I OFTEN let it slide when people mispronounce because it\u2019s just easier. I feel you.", "NTA. You get to decide how your name is pronounced. Hell, you can even go by an *entirely different* name at work. Lots of people do this when they're working with English speakers and have a name that the rest of them don't consistently remember, pronounce or spell. My boss has an English 'work first name,' because too many people had difficulty with his Chinese name. If he can do it with an entirely different name from his 'real' one, you can do it with a barely-different name.\n\nIt's not lying and even if it were there'd be no harm in it, it'd be a lie you're perfectly entitled to. You don't owe your work, your boss or your coworkers any transparency into your personal life. And I mean *any*. Beyond, like, filling correct legal info on the payroll documents.", "NTA\n\nSame here. Mine has two different possible pronunciations with the same spelling. I gave up years ago and just go with the common way to say it.", "NTA. I have an uncommon spelling with the common pronunciation too. If I'm asked to give my name for a takeout order, I don't give a rat's fart how they spell it. I will, however, correct them if they mispronounce it when reading it. Hey, your name, your choice.", "NTA. I also have a name that isn\u2019t pronounced like it\u2019s spelled, and I understand the struggle lol.", "NTA. You could go by a completely different name at work if you wanted to & it wouldn't make you the asshole & unless you're doing it to pull something over on somebody, it's not a lie.
