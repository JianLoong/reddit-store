You say she's already purchased properties to you and your brother, why doesn't she just set up something to pay for her grandchildren's childcare and nothing else?    She could also purchase a property and will it to your sister as the sole owner, or make arrangements for her to live there in the event she becomes a single mother.\n\nThe bottom line is that instead of icing your sister out, you could be helping your mom to creatively exclude BIL from benefitting from her estate.", "YTA, it\u2019s kinda shitty to do that to your sister and her kids, inheritance is inherited, not earned", "Wow..

To be fair to the next generation and maybe ease your mind, can you find a solution that you and your brother manage the properties until the children of your sister can take responsibility for them and then they go directly to them and potential income until then you can put into a trust or similar to support e.g., their education?", "ESH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBunch of spoiled brats arguing over who gets the most of mommy's money.", "YTA for manipulating your mother to disinherit your sister.

The 12 properties belong to our family trust because we built it ourselves (mostly mum, a little dad) the Family trust doesn\u2019t include BIL, but seeing how my sister has put her husbands name in the title of all the properties my mum has bought her, has made us assume she will find a way to share her inheritance with her husband. Hence why we\u2019ve limited her to her share of the life insurance.", "Unfortunately I couldn\u2019t explain with the limited word count, but the reason why I only asked to split the properties between myself and brother and not the life insurance is because one is our family home and the other (12 properties) was my mums life project. My sister will still get her share of the life insurance but the properties imo should be handed out to my brothers future children and my sisters kids when they\u2019re older. I don\u2019t plan on having kids and it would be pointless for me. That\u2019s my attempt, but I agree it does seem like I\u2019m icing her out and who knows, my mum\u2019s mind could change. But I know my BIL hasn\u2019t changed in nearly a decade and is still leeching off my sister and it would likely worsen if she gets more inheritance.", "It is still ultimately your mother's choice to how and to whom she wants to leave her assets.\n\nAlso: you say both you and your brother she gave 3 properties to, had that been after your sister went no contact?
