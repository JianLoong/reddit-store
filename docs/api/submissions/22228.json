You say she's already purchased properties to you and your brother, why doesn't she just set up something to pay for her grandchildren's childcare and nothing else?    She could also purchase a property and will it to your sister as the sole owner, or make arrangements for her to live there in the event she becomes a single mother.\n\nThe bottom line is that instead of icing your sister out, you could be helping your mom to creatively exclude BIL from benefitting from her estate.", "YTA, it\u2019s kinda shitty to do that to your sister and her kids, inheritance is inherited, not earned", "Wow..

To be fair to the next generation and maybe ease your mind, can you find a solution that you and your brother manage the properties until the children of your sister can take responsibility for them and then they go directly to them and potential income until then you can put into a trust or similar to support e.g., their education?", "ESH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBunch of spoiled brats arguing over who gets the most of mommy's money.", "YTA for manipulating your mother to disinherit your sister.

The 12 properties belong to our family trust because we built it ourselves (mostly mum, a little dad) the Family trust doesn\u2019t include BIL, but seeing how my sister has put her husbands name in the title of all the properties my mum has bought her, has made us assume she will find a way to share her inheritance with her husband. Hence why we\u2019ve limited her to her share of the life insurance.", "Unfortunately I couldn\u2019t explain with the limited word count, but the reason why I only asked to split the properties between myself and brother and not the life insurance is because one is our family home and the other (12 properties) was my mums life project. My sister will still get her share of the life insurance but the properties imo should be handed out to my brothers future children and my sisters kids when they\u2019re older. I don\u2019t plan on having kids and it would be pointless for me. That\u2019s my attempt, but I agree it does seem like I\u2019m icing her out and who knows, my mum\u2019s mind could change. But I know my BIL hasn\u2019t changed in nearly a decade and is still leeching off my sister and it would likely worsen if she gets more inheritance.", "It is still ultimately your mother's choice to how and to whom she wants to leave her assets.\n\nAlso: you say both you and your brother she gave 3 properties to, had that been after your sister went no contact?

I don\u2019t know why people get so obsessed about stuff, when they are not actually struggling.", "I feel bad for the mom. Kids are fighting over the inheritance (and discussing contesting the will) while she\u2019s still alive and well. You\u2019d think she\u2019s on her deathbed after reading this post.", "Nta. Don\u2019t listen to them op. Bil sounds like a mooch and a bum. People are forgetting that he STOLE and lied to his wife about the money the mom loaned out to them. He\u2019s also a thief. He doesn\u2019t deserve shit.", "NTA\n\nOn a side note, how much money do y\u2019all have :)", "You know this is Reddit, right?", "Don't trust you at all there is a massive whiff of self entitled shit coming off your post.", "NTA-  this is your Mom\u2019s decision and you voiced your opinion.  She has the final say,  she could accept your opinion or not.  If you\u2019re sister is NC with Mom why does she think she would get anything.  NC to me means no contact including assets.  However, if your Mom decided to exclude you too that\u2019s her decision.  It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with earning anything.", "ESH.", "Seriously, OP's mom buys each kid THREE properties? What in the White Lotus is all this shit?", "Try looking it more as a \"I don't want my lazy, entitled and dishonest BiL to get more stuff.\" OP is not really demanding more... they just want their BiL and sister to get less because of their lousy attitudes and how they've treated the rest of the family... and I'd have to agree. In OP's situation, I'd prefer the BiL's share go to charity than see him be rewarded for being a lazy leech. NTA from me.", "Everyone sounds like entitled AH", "ESH \n\nI hate everyone in this post lol", "I would do anything to be adopted by this family if they would just pay off my college and medical debt. I really hate being uninsured and needing to go to the ER. I vote ESH because how can you just fight over money when you have a ridiculous amount", "Preach", "God id kill for dental insurance", "Totally rich people problems.", "OP is an AH because you're jealous? Such a weird take.", "Came here to say that. You gave the correct answer.", "Was thinking, man this is some rich people shit. Mom gave them 3 properties each like damn.", "It\u2019s not your will. You\u2019re lecturing your sister about someone else\u2019s inheritance.", "This! Also, OP gets paid $100,000 annually to care for their mother. That's a lot of money. I get that BIL sounds like the most entitled of this group of entitled AHs but it's hard to have any sympathy for anyone in this story. \n\nYTA", "I'd prefer neither op nor bil get anything and it all go to charity but that's entirely irrelevant. OP is an ah", "Well that really has nothing to do with him.  His sister gets a third he is relevant. Op is the ah because it isn\u2019t his money.  It will be but only at the rate of 1/3 until he spoke and pushed out his sister.  She was getting it and by extension bil.  It wasn\u2019t going to him.", "I could understand taking off what they owe her, but beyond that, i dunno.", " Your mum appears to have made provisions for their kids", "I need to know what did you do to \"convince her\"?", "Your mom should see a lawyer. You do sound greedy af so YTA. Mom can alway set up a trust for sis so she can do what she wants with the inheritance", "So you're punishing your sister?", "There's no \"we\" involved Elon, your parents built it.", "'We' built it. Lol!! You did nothing.", "Ignore these people, they have a gender bias. You\u2019re NTA.\n\nShe went no contact with her mother, you actually help and support your mother, she shouldn\u2019t get the inheritance. Set something aside for the grandkids in a trust, they\u2019re innocent.", "This is not for you to decide. You should be telling your mom \u201cwhatever you want to do. I don\u2019t want an opinion. It\u2019s your money that you earned and you should do what you think is fair.\u201d  YTA", "Your 100k is payment for your contact with your mum, who you don't like, yet you present it as a sacrifice. What bullshit.", "I don't think it's unreasonable for your mother to cut out her daughter that doesn't speak to her.  That seems like a minimum requirement to get the gift of an inheritance.  And your mom seems like a strong-willed person, so perhaps you overestimate your ability to persuade her.  If your mom doesn't want BIL to get anything, what about setting up college fund trusts and the like?  She can help sis in a real way without giving $ to BIL.  She could also give her real property as life tenant, then she can't put his name on it.  She should talk to a lawyer and brainstorm about how to help sister without giving cash to BIL.  You'll feel better too.", "She presents looking after her mother, who she doesn't like, as charity when she's paid 100k to do it and THEN uses it as a reason to get in on the will.\n\nThis person is a greedy little fucker.", "But BiL is TA.  OP is just an AH.", "Your mother can give it as a personal asset, aka not a shared marital asset. Or put in a trust for the kids."]}
