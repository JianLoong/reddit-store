My sister is very hardworking with a good paying job, BIL however has been job hunting for at least 5 years. Personally, I believe it\u2019s BIL\u2019s ego and his laziness stopping him from getting a job. Any job I would offer would be rejected because \u201cwith his experience he at least deserves to be a manager & the money is too little\u201d\n\nMy sister is no contact with our mum, completely understandable because unfortunately my mother can be manipulative and is a borderline narcissist (the worst is her victim complex), however the catalyst was when BIL lied to my sister and told her our mum gifted them $20k when in actuality my mum said she would loan it to them. \nMy sister sided with BIL and claimed our mum was being manipulative but our mum argued that it\u2019s a ridiculous gift especially if it\u2019s to buy a property (this would be their 3rd, mum already paid for 2) Mum then blew up because by this point, she was paying BIL $100k to be her assistant but he was barely working (about 5hr days, 3 times a week) & always coming up with excuses to skip. He then left after 6 mons which is when I started working for mum.\n\nRecently the talk of inheritance arose due to dads cancer diagnosis. My parents are separated but mum has lots of assets inclu $1mil life insurance $2mil home & 12 properties (this is under a family trust she manages)\nHere is where I think I\u2019m the asshole bc I \u201cconvinced\u201d my mum to split her assets equally between myself and my brother excluding the life insurance. \n\nSomehow my sister found out & has asked we contest the will or draw up a contract to share the inheritance. I refused because imo inheritance is earned besides, Mum is alive and healthy so she can change her mind. \n\nMy sister  is upset & says that she deserves it just as much as we do but I disagree. I work 12hr days with my mum, driving her around, managing everything whilst also being my dad\u2019s caregiver. My sister also wants to throw mum into a nursery home whilst I would take her in. She said our brother didn\u2019t earn his keep but he\u2019s only19 and a student. Therefore the expectations should match that, plus he does the business artwork, chores & works part time. \n\nI told her she and her husband cant expect anything from someone they havent spoken to in a year and now her argument is that me and my brother already have enough (mum bought us 3 properties each) whilst she has to share with her husband & kids. \nMy sister says Im selfish, but I\u2019ve worked my whole life under my parents. Honestly I think its the stress of being the only source of income for a family with two young kids that is getting to her. I do feel for her, she\u2019s expressed she\u2019s worried she might lose her job because she cant dedicate time to her career bc of the kids, but both go to childcare 3 times a week & if BIL is unemployed, I dont know why this is. \nOn the other hand, my sister & BIL have always been entitled, before when BIL worked for mum, they would take mums credit card for groceries and other shopping and not tell her. They also did the same with my dad. \n\nMore than anything I dont want BIL\u2019s laziness to be rewarded with my mums hard work. Though I dont really like my mum (she\u2019s a narcissist but still my mum, it\u2019s all complicated feelings) I cannot deny she has set us up for life. To think of all the hardships mum endured migrating to Australia & juggling three jobs whilst pregnant to build her dream house & it could end up in BIL hands..makes my heart clench. \nSo am I the asshole? If it was my sister & kids I wouldnt mind, but her and BIL are a packaged deal\n\nNote: all family members (except sis and BIL) agree with this sentiment but I do feel guilty, I don\u2019t know how to ensure only my sister benefits not BIL\n\n\nAnother note: The 12 properties are under a family trust as we built them ourselves, BIL is not included in our family trust however sis has put BIL name on the title of all properties mum has bought her. My sister will always get her fair share of the life insurance.\n\n\nAnother note: I mentioned this in a reply, but we specifically want the 12 properties to remain under myself and my brothers care so we can pass them down to my sister children and my brothers future children, my sister or BIL would likely try to sell them, they are not mortgage free properties and we still need to manage rem. Also I don\u2019t plan on having kids so it\u2019s pointless for me to have this. because I won\u2019t have kids , my niece and nephew will inherit everything of mine.

You say she's already purchased properties to you and your brother, why doesn't she just set up something to pay for her grandchildren's childcare and nothing else?    She could also purchase a property and will it to your sister as the sole owner, or make arrangements for her to live there in the event she becomes a single mother.\n\nThe bottom line is that instead of icing your sister out, you could be helping your mom to creatively exclude BIL from benefitting from her estate.", "YTA, it\u2019s kinda shitty to do that to your sister and her kids, inheritance is inherited, not earned", "Wow..

It\u2019s a gift you\u2019re not entitled to, and it\u2019s not your choice who gets what. \n\nWhen my mum had terminal cancer, I took care of her. I spent as much time with her as I could. We hadn\u2019t had a good relationship but we sorted things out in her last couple of years and I\u2019m grateful for that. \n\nMy sister lives hours away and works long hours, she did as much as she could. My brother lives locally and did nothing. He wouldn\u2019t be there in her final couple of days because he found it too hard, and he didn\u2019t come to the party she asked us to throw for her instead of a funeral. We hired a boat and released her ashes in her favourite place - it was beautiful and he missed it. They never made amends and now he can\u2019t. \n\nShe left us her house which had tenants in it when she died as she was living in a flat. I managed that until they left and then we moved in and I paid my siblings rent until it sold. There was a huge amount of complex work that had to be done before it could be sold, which I did myself. My sister came back at weekends and decorated as I was pregnant at the time. My brother did a tip run once. \n\nThat house was split equally three ways because that\u2019s what my mum wanted. I didn\u2019t get more because I\u2019d done more work, and I didn\u2019t take care of her for money. I did it because it was the right thing to do and I could. \n\nOP, your mum was paying your BIL 100k a year to work for the business and now you\u2019re doing it so it seems likely you\u2019re being paid for your work. That shouldn\u2019t have any bearing on inheritance. \n\nYou need to let your parents make their own decisions. You don\u2019t need a bigger share of the inheritance - if anyone does it\u2019s your sister since she\u2019s got two kids and a shitty husband, but since they own three properties it\u2019s not like she is living hand to mouth either. Not sure where they would be if she became disabled or too unwell to work though. \n\nRegardless, this is up to your parents. You shouldn\u2019t be influencing them at all especially when you stand to benefit hugely from the decision you\u2019ve \u201cconvinced\u201d your mother to make. \n\nYou should apologise and tell your mother that you were wrong to weigh in on this and that it\u2019s entirely her decision. \n\nCutting a child out of your will or favouring some children over others in a will is really not about the money - it\u2019s an incredibly hurtful thing to do even if what\u2019s being left is a few hundred quid and a stamp collection. Does your mother really want to leave her daughter with the impression that she cared less about her than her other two children? That\u2019s how she must feel. \n\nIf your concern is really the BIL, there are ways around it - since you\u2019re saying you will eventually leave things to her kids, your mother could put property / money in a trust for them. She could speak to a solicitor about how to deal with things for your sister so that she\u2019s comfortable your BIL won\u2019t blow his way through it (like an annuity or a trust that pays out annually or whatever it is - I\u2019m sure there are options). \n\nYou\u2019ve really overstepped here and need to fix it.", "He doesn't want more money.

But the sister and BIL they act like they think rich people act. Spend here and there until it's all gone and BIL is worst, not only does he not have a job after 'searching' for half a decade but he doesn't even look after the kids as SAHD. Entrepreneurs need to breed entrepreneurs to keep the cash cow healthy and like it or not it becomes a job to manage those finances and keep it going. No amount of money will ever be enough for the sister and her family because it will be passed away.\n\nI had a similar situation (regarding a ton less money) where an aunt with a chronically unemployed husband who married in, was trying to force the sale of my grandparents house to cash out quick. But the other aunt who was left the house wanted to keep it since property values were rising so quick there would be so much more money if it appreciated. So she moved in, now twenty years later she revealed that in her will the house is now left to all of the grandchildren. She protected the asset (all siblings had jobs and houses already) since a little cash now would be worth a fortune later.

Sure, you can give things or change ownership before a passing (at least 2 years before, if not the other children can go to court to get their fair share), but completely disinheriting your children is impossible (They can deny or refuse their right to it, wise if your parents only have debts, but the heir needs to decide that for themselves)", "You didnt answer the question, why not directly give it to the kids?\n\nIf they got mad at you and didnt talk to you for a year would you still give them the properties?", "New money problems.", "Yeah, \"I drive mom around and blah blah blah\" yes and YOU'RE GETTING PAID FOR IT.

My point is there are ways to do this without just cutting anyone out. OP almost certainly knows all of this. He comes from a wealthy family and manages multiple properties.

Inheritance entitlements are by legal relationship, and, depending on your location, it often doesn't matter if the child is estranged from their parent, they're still entitled to an equal portion of the inheritance. But the deceased wishes will of course be accounted for if they did leave a valid will. But that just means that unless YOU or whoever is left behind after your mother passes to disperse the will as the executor, will have to show **material and objective cause** why your sister should be excluded from the will, and it *can't just be because she's financially irresponsible*.  \n\n\nIf you're in Australia, and you draw up the will to exclude your sister, then you're leaving yourself open for her to bring contest to the courts, which she has case to do. And then can just drain the inheritance in legal fees.\n\nI can't say if you're an A H, but it seems to me ESH, because you all seem entitled, greedy, and lazy in aspects and honestly ignorant of estate law. IANAL, but I've been dealing with my own estate issues and I can tell you that you really stink of knowing way less than you think you do.   \n\n\nInheritance law doesn't work on what you think people should have or what you think is moral. It works on legal entitlements and is neutral towards your feelings on the matter. \n\nIf you really want to be bitter and punitive, go off and let your mother cut your sis out of the will. But brace yourself for going through 1-2 years of financial loss and perpetual headache when she contests the will, which she is fully entitled to do. If you're specifically named as the executor of the will, CONGRATULATIONS, B, you played yourself and you're going to have to deal with that mess directly.  \n\n\n**You don't get to say what's fair, the courts do.** Consult a lawyer and if you, your mother and family really want to attempt to cut your sister off from what she'd be entitled to in intestacy, then you'll lose not only whatever she receives from the judgement but all the legal fees from the fight. \n\nYou're better off, and will lose less money and time, putting the bog-standard entitlements in writing and just making peace with the idea that your mother's \"hard earned inheritance\" will be 1/3rd \"wasted\" by your own family.
