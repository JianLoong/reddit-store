Your mum appears to have made provisions for their kids, so l think she is smart enough to know what your sister has married, and there is always the option to amend the will if she wises up and dumps the lowlife.", "NTA it sounds like sis and BIL already got their inheritance from mom when she bought them so much property.", "Good lord this is all first world problems. \u201cI was given/gifted this many properties. I also have a job.\u201d You know how many people don\u2019t have this? You are incredibly lucky and honestly sound La like you\u2019re trying to squeeze more money out by getting her (your mom) to exclude them. I get your BIL is lazy at but seriously you are little trying to take away from a sibling. Don\u2019t forget it is your mom\u2019s decision so she can just as easily kick you out of the will and leave it to your brother and sister instead.\n\nEdit: YTA", "You\u2019re too involved. It\u2019s not your will. You\u2019re lecturing your sister about someone else\u2019s inheritance. Your feelings about BIL are irrelevant. \n\nYou\u2019re also opening yourself up to sister\u2019s future \u201cundue influence\u201d claims against you, depending on where you live. If you convince your elderly mother to remove sister from will, and sister challenges the will, she could win and then everything gets split equally. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want BIL\u2019s laziness to be rewarded with mums hard work.\u201d \n\nNot up to you in the slightest. Your opinion is completely irrelevant. \n\nYTA.", "YTA.\n\nThese are not your decisions to make. You\u2019re destroying family relationships over greed, pettiness, and self-righteousness. You\u2019re being a selfish AH.", "**YTA**\n\nYour mom seems like a very volatile person, what she says a year from now could be very different from what she's saying now.   There is really no reason for you to put stir up her shitstorm.\n\nIf your mom's real problem is that she doesn't want your sister's husband to benefit from her estate, there are plenty of ways to do that -- trusts for the grandkids administered by a non-parent, annuity for your sister in an amount that would only marginally enable BIL.   You say she's already purchased properties to you and your brother, why doesn't she just set up something to pay for her grandchildren's childcare and nothing else?    She could also purchase a property and will it to your sister as the sole owner, or make arrangements for her to live there in the event she becomes a single mother.\n\nThe bottom line is that instead of icing your sister out, you could be helping your mom to creatively exclude BIL from benefitting from her estate.", "YTA, it\u2019s kinda shitty to do that to your sister and her kids, inheritance is inherited, not earned", "Wow.. YTA", "NTA in the end it is as you stated your mom\u2018s decision and I can see why you wouldn\u2019t want to enable your BIL further. I can also feel that you attribute sentimental value to the properties, which I find really admirable given that you all have your own assets anyway.  To be fair to the next generation and maybe ease your mind, can you find a solution that you and your brother manage the properties until the children of your sister can take responsibility for them and then they go directly to them and potential income until then you can put into a trust or similar to support e.g., their education?", "ESH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBunch of spoiled brats arguing over who gets the most of mommy's money.", "YTA for manipulating your mother to disinherit your sister. Doesn\u2019t sound like you even need more. You are just pathetically greedy.", "you and your sister sounds like a bunch of vultures, fighting over wealth you didn't help create, disgusting.\n\nESH, your BIL sucks but you suck even more for convincing your mom to take your sister out of the will just because you have beef with your BIL, let your mom make her decisions about **her money**", "I don't think YTA for not wanting it to go to BIL, but you easily could have persuaded your mother to just put your sister's share in a trust for your nephews/nieces. You are being greedy by having her split it between you and your sibling instead, so you are the asshole.", "I appreciate your concern but could your mom set up some kind of annuity that would provide a monthly sum to your sister with enough specifics thatBIL couldn\u2019t touch it. It seems unfair to exclude her. NTA for your feelings. YTA for your actions.", "YTA.  It really is none of your business who your mother chooses to give the inheritance to.  Ultimately it's her decision, not yours or anyone elses.  You can put your 2 cents in, but that's it.  I don't know your sis's financial situation, but regardless of BIL, why would you want to do that to your sister?  Yes your sis & BIL are AH's, but it still isn't your decision.  You are being selfish.", "Absolutely my sister works really hard! everyone in our family acknowledges it but my mum also doesn\u2019t want my BIL to inherit anything else from us. She was already on the fence about it, I think me saying \u201cI convinced her\u201d was perhaps putting it too strongly. Also, I think for you to expect someone to leave you something in death, you should at least be in their life?", "I agree, none of us are entitled to anything! I definitely view \u201cearning\u201d as having a relationship with the deceased which is why I\u2019m in this turmoil and want to make things right.", "Honestly the money is pretty recent, perhaps within the last 4-5 years. The 12 properties belong to our family trust because we built it ourselves (mostly mum, a little dad) the Family trust doesn\u2019t include BIL, but seeing how my sister has put her husbands name in the title of all the properties my mum has bought her, has made us assume she will find a way to share her inheritance with her husband. Hence why we\u2019ve limited her to her share of the life insurance.", "Unfortunately I couldn\u2019t explain with the limited word count, but the reason why I only asked to split the properties between myself and brother and not the life insurance is because one is our family home and the other (12 properties) was my mums life project. My sister will still get her share of the life insurance but the properties imo should be handed out to my brothers future children and my sisters kids when they\u2019re older. I don\u2019t plan on having kids and it would be pointless for me. That\u2019s my attempt, but I agree it does seem like I\u2019m icing her out and who knows, my mum\u2019s mind could change. But I know my BIL hasn\u2019t changed in nearly a decade and is still leeching off my sister and it would likely worsen if she gets more inheritance.", "It is still ultimately your mother's choice to how and to whom she wants to leave her assets.\n\nAlso: you say both you and your brother she gave 3 properties to, had that been after your sister went no contact? Because if it was way before, I get that she is angry about that.", "I\u2019m going to say ESH, with that being said there are ways to go about splitting things with Sister. I do believe that Sister is enabling husband.\n\na trust can be set up in wife\u2019s name to issue a certain amount of money every month setting up a trust for for grandchildren for college or whatever that they can\u2019t access it 21 or whatever she decides.  Just make sure the trust is set up with a lawyer or a trusted friend because if it\u2019s set up in the Sister\u2019s name you know darn well the husband\u2019s gonna take it.\n\nI did this with my middle child she\u2019s 46 and still hasn\u2019t figured out her life. She\u2019s made many bad choices drugs included. I have set up a trust to help her get her own place and sustain herself. But I\u2019m not going to give her a large amount of money in cash because she would be broke in a month.\n\nThis might be something to discuss with your mom. There\u2019s ways to include Sister and exclude husband. Giving her monthly income from the trust is going to help her out too.", "That\u2019s the thing. Your BIL wouldn\u2019t be inheriting anything, your sister would. It is her choice what to do with that money once the estate has been settled and no one can say boo about it.", "You\u2019re also not entitled to \u201cmake things right\u201d or meddle an \u201cconvince\u201d your Mom what to do with her money. That\u2019s her business. Sure, if she asked you can give your opinion, but that does not involve convincing or actively coercing like you did. \n\nAnd your BIL is completely irrelevant regardless if he\u2019s lazy or not just as any siblings spouse would be, including yours, if you have one. Grandkids are relevant, but spouses aren\u2019t unless your Mom wants them to be.", "You\u2019re not in the turmoil. You\u2019ve inserted yourself by choice. There\u2019s nothing for you to make right. Get over yourself. It\u2019s not your estate. End of story.", "YTA. There is no \u201cearning\u201d. Greed is the only thing motivating you being an asshole to your sister and it\u2019s a shitty thing to have done to her. \n\nYou\u2019re in this turmoil bc you\u2019re selfish.", "If they are married his will always be entitled to half of what she has.", "So \"we\" didn't build it then, your parents did.", "The life insurance will be cash that will benefit your BIL more than any other arrangement.   It would be much better to designate a trust for the children as beneficiary then construct a different settlement for her.   The trust could be set up to pay for their childcare only.   Your sister could be left a property with a life interest only -- in other words, she can live there but not sell it with the rest held in trust for the kids.", "Mother bought Sisters first 2 houses and helping with the 3rd. So they are all equal with the 3 properties. Plus gave her deadbeat husband a job making 100k that wasn\u2019t good enough for him. Personally I wouldn\u2019t give the daughter anything until she left her husband. The inheritance will be squandered in .5 seconds and they will be looking for a hand out again.", "We all got our properties within the same time period , over the course of about 2 years, this was when my sister wasn\u2019t NC. I think I should have clarified, most of the assets are in a family trust that my mum manages hence it\u2019s sorta a group decision. Quickly gathering I am the AH and now trying to figure out how to rectify this while keeping the peace.", "Unless she never really has it. Carefully constructed trust. She might get the income from properties (to share), but not the properties.", "Thank you for the clarification!"]}
