For context Ds son works on our department(25M), we used to get on well but the special treatment he gets bugs me and the rest of my colleagues. Yesterday I snapped.\n\nThere was snow yesterday and we provide a delivery service at work. Nobody wanted to work but everyone who was scheduled to work came in and worked there shift, except for my Ds son who refused.\n\nI started work at 7 yesterday morning (I was doing customer service, not driving) and was supposed to be on until 1. But when 1 came D begged me to stay on until 5. 5.30 rolled around and I was still there but was fed up and about to leave.\n\nWhen I met the drivers who came in for their shift they yelled at me as they had to do D son\u2019s deliveries as well as their own. At this point I thought I\u2019m not paid enough for this shit. So I told them I agree with them and listed them some actions they could take:\n1.just don\u2019t do the extra deliveries and I would explain in the morning\n2. Ring D tell her to fix it \n3.Get the store manager(Ds boss) tell him they are going home due to unsafe work conditions as if it isn\u2019t safe for Ds son to work it\u2019s not safe for them\n\nThey wanted to go with option 3.  I went to get the store manager so they could speak to him together. I walked into the office and said to the store manager could he come to my department the drivers needed to speak to him. He asked why and I said Ds nepotism has finally bit her in the ass. After I explained the situation he came to our department and the drivers said they were leaving. He said he understood and would talk to our manager and asked would they call the customers before they leave, they refused. He then looked at me, normally I\u2019m a push over but I said no, it\u2019s above my pay grade he would have to pay me extra to do it. He said he would pay me double for my entire shift so I agreed.\n\nHe was furious so he rang my manager to go mad. He said he was going to have to pay me to do her job because she was incompetent. D asked to speak to me. She asked why I encouraged the drivers and didn\u2019t smooth out the situation. I told her that she had pushed it to far this time and that the department is fed up of her. She said he is her son and if he had an accident she wouldn\u2019t forgive herself. I told her that she acts her sons life is more important than mine because now I was working a minimum of a 13 hour shift in a blizzard and then had to get home and if i crash on the way home that\u2019s on her. She was crying but I just hung up the phone. \n\nAll night was getting texts and calls from her checking if I was ok, which I ignored. This morning Ds son was in and said I\u2019m an asshole for turning everyone against him and his mum. He also said D didn\u2019t sleep worrying about me.\n\nMaybe I am an asshole for how handled things but I think I\u2019m justified.

Not you 2. The real problem which is double standards +  bad and biased management. You are highly skilled into protecting yourself and pointing at the real inconsistencies. You should work in ... Let me think and I ll add it in a comment below. Congrats for such a huge performance.\n\nBy the way the manager was not worried about you. She realized that you were not that easy. Do not let her guilt trip you somehow. \nNTA of course :)", "NTA at all. Honestly I think this was the wake up call D needed. Clearly her son still has his head in the sand though.", "NTA.  Shit like this is why the company I work for has a policy of not hiring family members of current staff.  \n\n>She said he is her son and if he had an accident she wouldn\u2019t forgive herself.\n\nA good boss would extend that concern to their whole staff, and close given unsafe weather conditions (assuming non-essential deliveries that can be delayed a day).", "NTA. Their behaviour turned everybody against them, not you. You not \"smoothing out\" the situation doesn't make you the AH, especially since you (rightfully) agree with the drivers.\n\nI don't buy D worrying about you all night.", "NTA for sure.\n\n\nShe didnt sleep due to the stress of facing everyone the next day, not because she was worried sick about you.\n\n\nDo not let manipulators make you out as the bad guy.", "NTA - The only reason that everyone was against D and her son was because of their wholly unacceptable work practices. Not your fault.", "NTA. Nepotism is a disgusting aspect of the workplace and should be called out whenever it happens.", "NTA - most employers have rules that wouldn\u2019t allow family members to report to each other, because there are always problems like this.", "NTA, if she's going to give her son special privileges on work matters that mean other people (like you and the drivers) have to pick up the slack then she *is* incompetent and *should* be chewed out. Your boss apparently agrees.\n\nI've been stranded on the road overnight in bad weather coming back from a long shift before, it's no fucking joke. Glad you're OK and D deserves to lose sleep over the consequences of her actions. You could have lost way more", "NTA at all. You were correct and hopefully it causes changes at your job.", "Absolutely NTA. Something could happen to her little prince, but others experiencing more risk because of this is absolutely ok? Mighty big ah, and these are crocodile tears. The son is one piece of work as well- guilt tripping others. You have to look after yourself.", "NTA\n\nI bet everyone there is important to someone, but they still got up and went to work as they have responsibilities. Would they have gotten a warning or been fired if they didn't show up like the son. Also will the son still be paid for that day?", "NTA. You handled the situation very well IMO.", "NTA - and sounds like D finally found out", "NTA.  This is what \"fuck around and find out\" is all about.  I can understand her heightened concern for her son, that is just natural, but that shouldn't impact the rest of the work force.  If she expected everyone else to come in, he needed to come in.  If she wanted him to stay home for his safety, everyone should.  There is nothing wrong with standing your ground here.  And her losing sleep due to worry was self inflicted, not your problem.  If this hadn't happened, she wouldn't have lost sleep due to worry because she wouldn't have even thought about you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will cavoite this - if he has a disability that makes driving in the snow more dangerous than for non-disabled employees, that is a different story, so long as no one else that was forced to work had a similar disability situation", "NTA as I've said multiple times since the ice storm hit here in Washington state, none of your employers care if you die on your way to work, they'll just be concerned with having to cover you or find your replacement.", "NTA although maybe not the wisest from a professional standpoint to be telling off your boss (however justified it is, and in this case it is definitely justified). But if this isn\u2019t somewhere you plan to have a long career or need a reference from, then it doesnt matter too much. Good for you for standing up for yourself and your colleagues.", "NTA. The absolute audacity of trying to blame you for not trying to calm people down when *both* her and her son weren't at work. And trying to excuse her behaviour by pointing out that she knows *exactly* how dangerous work was today because she didn't want her *own* son to be there, but it was perfectly fine for the children of other people to endure.\n\nDon't be a doormat, she's just explicitly stated that she only gives a damn about her employee's safety if it makes her feel bad. She didn't care whether you got home from work, she wanted to abate her guilt because she knows she's wrong. Stop covering for her, tell the boss every time she fails to do her job, creates more work for the rest of you, or treats you unfairly to give her son an advantage.", "NTA", "NTA.   If her and her son can't do their damn job then they deserve to have their ass chewed out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
