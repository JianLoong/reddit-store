This sexual harassment would infuriate me and if the parents aren\u2019t going to protect me, then I\u2019d take matters into my own hands. Any unwanted physical advances would be reciprocated in painful unwanted physical attacks in return. Something like a thin branch from a bush the width of your finger can be *extremely* effective on a hand or an arm, and won\u2019t cause any long term damage that he can\u2019t heal from. But that sting is *painful* and *memorable.* If he has the capacity to think \u201cit\u2019s right there and I can touch it before you can do anything about it,\u201d then he can also learn \u201cIf I do that action, she\u2019s going to whip me with that branch and it\u2019s going to fucking hurt so it\u2019s not worth it.\u201d IMO if I have the choice between being sexually assaulted or getting physically violent, I will take the physical violence 100% of the time. That\u2019s just me. Again, this isn\u2019t sound advice but I\u2019ve got trauma surrounding my older brother molesting me (I\u2019m the youngest and smaller), feeling helpless is too deteriorating for me to endure, I will choose violence even if the outcome overall is worse for me physically (my brother being older and larger didn\u2019t deter me from fighting even though I\u2019d lose). Don\u2019t have a branch with you? Fists and feet can also get a message across, but are often viewed as more extreme than a thin branch. Also, you\u2019d have to learn control as to where to land the blows, because you can cause serious damage giving your fist to his face (not to mention how much it can hurt your own hands). Stick to soft fleshy parts away from inner organs - so focus on upper arms, thighs, front shoulder area. Stay away from lower back area - kidneys are there and are easily damaged. Press on your own body to see what areas are more sensitive and use that knowledge to attack those areas. And make it known every time he verbally announces he\u2019s thinking about touching you. \u201cIf you so much as brush up against me just to piss me off, I *will* knock the everliving shit out of you and I *do not fucking care* about the repercussions. Your unwanted physical advances will be met with equally unwanted physical advances.\u201d Be prepared to have to follow through because he\u2019ll test that boundary. Make it known that no matter what, you\u2019ll not regret it and you *will* do it again if you need to. All he\u2019s gotta do is leave you the fuck alone. Hope for the best in that he just needs a threat, but be prepared for the worst that you\u2019ll have to act upon it. Bonus points if you stay calm after he\u2019s brushed up against you and pretend to \u201clet it slide.\u201d Then in the middle of the night, wake him up with repeatedly whacking his arms and legs while screaming \u201cNEVER THINK ABOUT TOUCHING ME AGAIN YOU SICK FUCK!\u201d Really drive that point home. Your parents will be pissed but you\u2019ve got one simple thing to say, \u201cYou\u2019re doing jack shit to protect me from him, so I\u2019m going to protect myself. If you\u2019re not going to control his behavior, then I\u2019m not going to control mine.\u201d Whatever issues he has, people *understand* pain. He obviously can put two and two together. Definitely make sure he knows that whatever he inflicts on you, you will inflict it back tenfold. Make sure he knows that whatever he wants to do will not be worth your retaliation. Also, keep in mind that if you need to use your own body to deliver the message, you can injure yourself doing so. I advise looking up how to throw a proper punch to minimize damage to yourself, and practice these moves. If you utilize a weapon, make sure it doesn\u2019t cut skin and draw blood. This is seen as a line that shouldn\u2019t be crossed, goes into that territory as being too violent/serious/crazy. You do NOT want to cross that line. Bruises are okay; blood is not.\n\nYou\u2019re 15, parents are divorcing, are they using lawyers? I\u2019m not familiar with the system but there absolutely should be someone you can talk to about this. If it\u2019s going through courts, at 15 you should have a say in where you stay. If they come to talk to you, absolutely let them know what is going on and tell them you do not want to live with your brother right now. Your parents are being selfish assholes and don\u2019t care that you\u2019re suffering for it.\n\nAnyways\u2026 pick your battles. There will be fallout and your parents will treat you like shit but at least you won\u2019t be molested by them (I hope).\n\nI say again: I\u2019m extremely biased and am not giving the soundest of advice. Many factors aren\u2019t being taken into consideration. Ramifications of reacting this way won\u2019t be known until it\u2019s done, and it can possibly get awful. It\u2019s upon you to assess your situation and accept whatever happens. I personally feel I benefited from rage and fallout from my parents. Your mileage may vary.", "Okay so reading through some of it I want to say\n\nThe reason for my parents divorce is my mum cheated on my dad so they really hate each other so they have quite a lot on their plate.\n\nI also would like to say I do not know whether I can tell a pastoral teacher since they are creeps at my school at least but I will try.", "So answering some other things.\nI am female.\nAnd if I did try hit him or anything my father would probably hit me back too.\n\n(And I wouldn\u2019t say my parents are physically abusive just a few slaps if I deserve it which I understand)\n\nAnd I will add I live in UK.", "NTA - Autism or not, your parents are allow him to assault you.

That means they have to report abuse if they think or know it\u2019s happening. \n\nIt might be awkward, but talking to a teacher or counselor may just be the help you need. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re having to deal with this. Your parents should be protecting you. \n\nOften times, parents will give in to the child making the most noise and causing the most chaos because they don\u2019t want to deal with it. Start being louder with your dislike about how your brother is sexually harassing and abusing you. Let them know his behavior is abusive towards you and that you don\u2019t feel safe. Don\u2019t let them quiet your voice. You need a safe space.", "Not always.  My older son has autism and started sexually acting out when he reached puberty because he couldn't understand or handle the hormones flooding him all of a sudden.  He was questioned at length by experienced professionals and they concluded that he was telling the truth when he said that he hadn't been sexually abused.  Unlike the OP's parents though, we didn't sweep it under the rug and instead took measures to deal with this problem.  \n\nOP, this is your parents' fault and you don't deserve to have to put up with this.  Please report it ASAP.", "Their ages add context.\nObviously, the behaviour of OP's brother is massively inappropriate, and why the parents are not dealing with it is beyond me.\nI think it would help if we knew if these young teenagers (which I am guessing so), or adults who still live with their parents.", "Is he big for his age? I would sit down your Dad and explain you feel unsafe around your brother. That he is getting bigger and stronger and so you will not be able to fight off his sexual assaults. Say it just like that. Ask him what he recommends you should do when your brother overpowers you and touches you sexually. Make it super clear.", "Yep, great detective work. There are only two countries that speak English in the world.", "In trying to correct the USdefaultism you just UKdefaulted, friend. Australian here saying hi, we say mum too. (And there are others!)", "So if they were young teenagers, she would be the A H? No matter their ages, she doesn't want to be around him, and she has every right to feel safe at home. I'm hoping you're trying to decide between N T A and N A H only.", "He is yes. He is taller and much stronger than I am. I have already tried talking to my parents about how I feel unsafe but they tell me I\u2019m overreacting etc.", "Stop making assumptions about me. I am only trying to get a better grasp of the situation.This sounds too serious to be worrying about who to judge as the AH.\n\nSounds like this 15 year old girl might actually need help from professional services like the CPS tbh. As she has mentioned, her parents are not protecting her from her brother's inappropriate actions. Probably recommend she talks to a councillor at school. \n\nIf she was old enough to move out, then that would be my advice. Can understand that moving out can be difficult, but it's probably her best option if she was old enough.", "Sorry I have no good advice. I think you seem to understand the magnitude of this.\n\nYou could try to get them to give you instructions on what specifically you should do when he is trying to touch you.  Say you are just asking for advice and help walk through scenarios. \nDon\u2019t argue or get defensive. Tell you Dad you are a teen girl now an need to know what to do when guys are getting aggressive with you.", "Sorry dude (or dudette) - was honestly just trying to get a bit of insight into your thinking. Agree that she/they need help, but it doesn't sound like the parents will do anything in that regard. Really hope she is able to get professional help."]}
