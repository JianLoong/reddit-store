That\u2019s a huge achievement. I hope you\u2019ll be able to get it reprinted.", "NTA At his age he should not be acting like an 8 year old when someone else is getting attention. His parent's actions are telling, they enable his behavior and ensure he never has to take responsibility for his actions. He is a grown man, **he** should not have acted out in that manner and since **he** did, **he** should have apologized and paid you. You were understandably upset and snapped at him. You had a reason to be upset, his actions were based on jealousy.", "NTA. How old is this man again? 5?", "NTA you were sharing a accomplishment and he was jealous of the intention your family was giving you! You didn't overreact and you must distance yourself from people who don't encourage you on your success it tell everything you need to  know about your feelings towards you! He is not a kid but a adult so stop trying to find excuse on his mean behavior", "NTA of course, but this is so weird. When your 14 year old acts out and vandalizes something this is a good way to handle it. If Carl was a teenager then I would say everyone (outside of Carl obviously) did a great job responding to this. But:\n\nWhy are his parents acting like he\u2019s a child? A 26 y.o man being treated like a kid explains exactly how he got this way. \n\nNot that the parents paying you isn\u2019t nice or appropriate, but they need to stop coddling him. You don\u2019t \u201cpunish\u201d a 26 year old man or solve his problems. You tell him he\u2019s not a child and he\u2019s gotta be an adult.", "NTA\n\nHonestly it doesn't make sense that a grown man would throw a book out the window because he was tired of hearing about it. Your cousin could of left the room /house at any point. It isn't normal for him to just talk about his interest but never yours.\n\n\nDid your cousin apologize himself or did his parents do it fot him? Why didn't he pay you back himself? Is your cousin autistic/on the spectrum at all? He clearly lacks the ability to regulate his emotions. \n\nAnd no, I don't think you were out of line for telling him off about figures cause he literally said he didn't care about your book & tried to destroy it. You didn't physically destroy his figures,  just gave him a reality check.", "what success?", "To be sincere, my aunt and uncle are amazing people who came to me on their own to repay me on their own.\n\nCarl is generally quite mature.

Op said they had worked on this book for a while, we don't know their age but they started it when they were twenty. Writing is also extremely personal to them and Carl knew OP was doing it since they were a child. All OP did was tell them the truth that they never cared about the figurines since obviously Carl never cared about the book. After having their personal property destroyed, yelling seems to be an under-reaction.", "NTA.  \n\nWhen I first read this, I thought it was your actual book, like you had handwritten the whole thing and were about to print it.

He's **TWENTY-FUCKING-SIX**, not six, so his behavior was absolutely unacceptable.\n\n2.  Is he mentally handicapped?  Because that's the impression I'm getting here. I'm getting the impression of a mentally handicapped individual whose parents have coddled him (as evidenced by them coming to apologize for him and offer money for what's not really replaceable) instead of actually addressing his issues and training him accordingly.", "NTA\n\nIt's normal to have a reaction when someone purposefully destroys something of sentimental value because they are envious.\n\nEnvy is a sin for a reason, it makes people do hurtful things.  Jealousy is: I want what you have.  Envy is: I want what you have, I don't want you to have it, and I will take it from you if I can.  He was envious of everyone's attention and praise towards you and your accomplishment/success for completing your book.\n\nI see a stupid figurine in your future.", "NTA lol what \n\nwhy should you care about his figurines anyway \n\nit's not like you took them and snapped them in half or something", "NTA this man is 26 and should know better.", "Nta. Your cousin was acting like a toddler by throwing the book out the window. Glad his parent payed you to replace it however he should have been the one to do it", "NTA. But honestly I\u2019d rethink your assessment of your cousin\u2019s maturity. He 1) threw a tantrum and 2) rather than apologizing himself, his parents did on his behalf.

What kind of grown person does that?", "I think you mistyped Carl\u2019s age because he sounds like a 6 yr old\nNTA", "Absolutely NTA. What the hell, man. As an aspiring writer myself, I know it's a labor of love. I feel your pain.\n\nAnd to think that Carl, an adult man, can't even be bothered to apologize for his actions (which were already beyond the pale) just irritates me to no end.", "Does Carl have some sort of intellectual disability or something?

Definitely the asshole.", "Carl mistreated the only person who took an interest in his interests. Who might've been the only friend in the family he actually had.\n\nWhy people do this, I have no idea. I'm sure it has something to do with familiarity and abuse/power dynamics, but I see this shit all the time.", "That part in Little Women still pains me.", "If it was my handwritten book and that was the only copy, I think would have gutted him.\n\nI write on my pc and have many backups.", "no, he is generally mature and calm. Yesterday was an exception. It wouldn't be rare for us to ask each other for advices and him being the mature one in the discussion.", "They will take the money from him.", "The point is he generally doesn't act like that. There have been many times when we asked each others for advice about a situation and he was often the mature one. That's why I don't understand his behavior.", "Finishing a book is a huge achievement. So many people start writing something and never finish it. There must be hundreds of thousands of part written novels in the world.", "Yeah Indeed", "Just wanted to point something out: he share is hobby with his parents and they gladly listen to him. It's just that I'm the only one in the family who is close in age so I'm the one who he shared his hobby the most.", "Perhaps his \"maturity\" that you experience is because you only focused on Carl's interests during your discussions. Perhaps you would notice a different personality dynamic if you went on primarily about your own instead.", "Might be worth asking him what\u2019s going on when he has calmed down - if it\u2019s really unusual for him. Maybe there is something going on for him.", "If someone took something of mine and just tossed it out a window, the least I would do is yell at them", "I understood that.  I haven't had my coffee today, so it took a minute.  Thank goodness for backups.  \n\nYour cousin is still TAH, for destroying your property.  Even if he just yelled at you like that, the response is outrageous.  Keep writing!", "Well then he was definitely **WAY** out of line for what he did and your response is completely justified.", "I'm quite sure there are like 20 only in my pc.", "if and when he apologize sincerely, I will ask", "No really finishing writing a book is a huge accomplishment. It takes time and skill and dedication. You're super impressive :)", "This. It's not like listening to Carl talk about his collection is something that stopped at any point; it's still a big interest of his, still something he adds to and talks to OP about. That's not digging up something from the past, it's ongoing.\n\nAnd I don't know if you are, or are familiar with, any artists or writers yourself, u/JonDaBon, but as an artist who occasionally writes, with a lot of friends who are also artists and/or writers, and as someone who's a Big Nerd that almost exclusively associates with other Big Nerds... Writing, in my opinion, is much, *much* more personal. With all of my friends, when one of us lets another read their work (usually when it's still in progress), it's considered an act of trust and sort of an honor.

I had to go back and re-read for Carl's age - because I thought no way a 26 year old whole ass adult is behaving this way.  But I guess Carl is.  Carl's got issues not being the center of attention.", "Congratulations on your book, OP! I teach creative writing to adults and finishing a book is a MASSIVE achievement that deserves to be celebrated! I'm so sorry he was so jealous of the attention you got and so unappreciative of all the empathetic interest you offered to his passion. Please use the money they gave you to get another copy bound. I wonder if his present will be a figurine of a character? That would be kinda cool, having MERCH as a writer is so much fun. \n\nI hope you keep writing and taking joy in it. And I don't doubt that your empathy makes you a better writer and is honed by your writing.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t think you overreacted - his behavior was immature and cruel.

And you were right to point out that people who care about each other listen to the things they are enthusiastic about even when it\u2019s not their cup of tea.\n\n> He cared about having someone to talk about his figurine and I was happy seeing him happy when he talked about them.\n\nAnd you can still do that, AND expect the same from him.\n\nIf in general he\u2019s a good person, this may have just been a moment where he (wrongly) gave in to a bad impulse - and it is a good sign that he wants to offer restitution, not just an apology. \n\nAnd if he doesn\u2019t repeat the behavior.", "NTA sir.

People can have hobbies and collect whatever they want, no big deal, but to the point of becoming so upset that your family were talking about your finished book instead of his precious figurines, he had a tantrum and threw it out the window?

You both made civil attempts to tolerate those special interests in the past. He suddenly crapped all over your special interest and destroyed the product of it. In doing so he implied your special interest was unworthy or lesser. \n\nIt seems only reasonable that you point out that you don't see an intrinsic value to his special interest over yours, and though you might regret wishing it was destroyed, it's fair that you wished him to feel the same devastation you felt when your book was ruined. \n\nAmazing work on finishing your book.
