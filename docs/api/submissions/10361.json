They have not received the money.  If the ex was trying to break into the account, it sounds like she was trying to access the money for herself. If it's just $4000, that really isn't going to go very far towards college for two children. \n\nAt 10 and 8, by the time they are ready for college, they won't even remember that money. If the girlfriend put any money into that account then YWBTA, but NTA otherwise. It's still your money. They aren't your children and not your responsibility. Despite the intentions of the money, it was never anyone but yours. It is not a gift. It is an investment for the future and that future has now been altered.", "I think You can roll it into an IRA so you dont have to pay taxes on it", "Sometimes in life, you have to be an AH.\n\n From your description,  she will try to take the money out and spent it on herself.. \n\nSo.. do what you gotta do.", "NTA - but with a 529 aren't there gonna be stiff tax penalties if you take it back?", "NTA. You didn\u2019t owe it to them in the first place. She\u2019s responsible for her kids. Get your money back and let her move on and be mad. \n\nThere are too many women that expect the man in their life to take care of their kids when the father won\u2019t. It\u2019s a nice thing to do but certainly NOT an obligation.", "I am split here.  So ESH. She is being sneaky and trying to change the passwords etc.  You said some harsh stuff about the kids not being grateful etc.", "NTA- it\u2019s your money, they aren\u2019t your kids, you aren\u2019t together, however\u2026 why set up college funds for them?

This merely reinforces the fact you\u2019re an AH.", "Info: how old are the kids?", "YTA. You gave it to them as a gift. Saying they can only have it only if their mom is in a relationship with you is all kinds of wrong.", "YTA. You gave a gift to children and you're taking it away. Idk who broke up with whom, but if she broke up with you, it's very easy to see why.", "YTA. This was a gift for children. C'mon dude.", "Im confused, as children, do they have custodians to the account? Are old are the kids? Whose the custodian? Whose ss numbers did you use to set up those accounts?\n\nYta bc you already gifted it. Gifts arent conditional. Your problems are with her, not them.  Move on.", "Nta\nnot your kids, not her money", "NTA although you should never have set that up/told her about the money in the first place. That seems like a big commitment and expectation for a boyfriend. Tell her to jog on", "YTA. You should never get involved in saving for or funding a child's future education if you are going to make it conditional on your relationship with someone else. You would not be TA if you stop contributing money now, but you've already contributed that money, and the ex GF can't go back on those years and come up with a different plan for them.\n\nNo matter what her kids are like, for whatever reason you agreed to do this. Taking back what you've already gifted to them is definitely an AH move and punishes kids for what happened between you and their mom.", "NTA.", "It\u2019s not a gift yet, it\u2019s a college savings account and you can change the beneficiaries any time you want.\n\nIf you decided you wanted to go back to school before they were old enough to go to college you could use that money for yourself.  NTA", "Yta just not for this money thing. Just in general YTA.  Do the world a favor and don't breed.", "Why don't you be the bigger person here and recognize that you once wanted to help the kids. Keep the accounts for the kids. They probably won't be grateful until they are young adults. Kids expect to be taken care of and don't really have the capacity or maturity to recognize extraordinary acts of generosity until they are young adults.", "NTA. If you want to take it back, take it. It's actually your money. Obviously there will be a tax penalty for it and yeah, it will hurt but you have every right since you are the controller of the account as hence YOUR account. The 2 of you are not together anymore and they're not your kids to begin with so the favor you were doing for them can be rescinded.\n\nEx gf knew this which is why she was trying to change the pw but unfortunately for her, it it's an account in your name you just waltz into the bank and get it rectified.", "Nope", "I thought with a 529 if you didn't use the money for education you lost it.  I guess if OP has children of his own he can change the beneficiaries to them, but if not, the money is gone.", "NTA\n\nYou are the legal owner of the 529 plans.  It's still YOUR money.  You could withdraw the money, or you could look into changing the beneficiaries (for instance, to your own name or the names of nephews and nieces).  It's your money, not your Ex GF's or the kids'.", "YTA. Also maybe stupid? Why were you contributing to someone else\u2019s kid\u2019s college fund when you had no intention of sending that kid to college? That 4000 is going to be tiny when it gets hit by the taxes you skirted around in the 529.", "These kids have a father and a mother so I don't think it is your responsibility to pay for college of an ex girlfriends kids.  \n\nBut to give the hope of having that money, then taking it away is definitely an asshole move.  \n\nESH mom for especially trying to change the password on a account You are the sole contributer to and you for giving college help then taking it away.", "You should look at recent post.

Op just says young. What expectations does he have for their gratefulness?  Thanks for food from a 7 year old?  And he calls them animals.  Their fault or their moms?  And are they just being normal kids?  There's a lot left out here.  Young kids often feel like a moved in person is another parent and don't feel grateful for every normal crumb.", "That's pretty much how it goes in relationships. It's contingent on the couple staying together.", "He won\u2019t answer but as per his other post, they are 8 and 10. He thinks they\u2019re lazy and undisciplined because they occasionally want to take naps during the day and he thinks it\u2019s disrespectful and lazy to touch your bed except to sleep in it at night.", "Around 10 and 8", "You can see my post history for why. It\u2019s because I have standards for how kids should behave and her kids were like animals.", "It is a gift your right but the gift has not been given yet because the children are not old enough for college.", "The kids are 8 and 10.

In 10 or 15 years these kids are going to remember this money exists and know how to track it down? No, this is weird. My grandparents bought us savings bonds when we were born, they didn\u2019t give them to us until we were 18 so it was not a gift to us until they actually gave them to us. Can you imagine if they needed that money and when they used it I tried to clean that that was my money?  That\u2019s not how these things work.", "everything in this world is conditional, their actions led to this decision.

Just look at his post history.", "Pretty sure this poster is OP\u2019s alt lol.", "You don\u2019t even have to withdraw it right now you can just change the beneficiary, you can probably make it yourself I know you can use these accounts for yourself if you go back to school.", "Good for you, yeah I think that's the point of the 529  is basically it kind of boxes that money into needing to be used for school but hope you get most of it back!", "1. She\u2019s not getting anything. It\u2019s for the kids. You aren\u2019t obligated to give it to them, but don\u2019t do this just to spite her.\n\n2. Did she sit on the bed during unauthorized hours? Is that why she doesn\u2019t deserve it? Or maybe there was some other infraction, like running in the halls? Speaking before spoken to? Using \u201ccan\u201d instead of \u201cmay\u201d?", "That\u2019s what happens when you break up - people are no longer committed to promises. It would be one thing for him to remain custodian BUT she was trying to change the password so I wouldn\u2019t trust that she wouldn\u2019t find a way to cash out and the kids not get it.", "This is the guy who forbade his stepchildren from using their own beds unless they were sleeping on them at night. He has some MAJORLY f\u2019ed up views on children.", "That bed rule is really, really stupid. Also what do her kids have to be grateful for? You don't have good things to say about them.", "These people claiming it\u2019s a gift have no idea what a 529 even is. It\u2019s ridiculous to think that children of a girlfriend do you had 10 years or 15 years ago or however long it takes before they get to college age are going to remember and depend on the few thousand dollars that you put in a 529 for them. They probably won\u2019t even remember you exist. They wouldn\u2019t even know to use this money if you kept it available to them. \n\nThey are scummy mom might want to do a little research and understand that she can\u2019t access that money. Once she understood that she would probably stop caring about it at all.", "I read your post history. Apparently you were a controlling AH who somehow thought napping is always lazy?\n\nScientific studies consistently prove the health & performance benefits of naps and some of the most successful people plan naps into their day, so this is kind of a bonkers claim in 2023.", "Explain animals.  And does the gf let them.get away with it.  Often people have unrealistic expectations of kids who aren't theirs.", "What actions exactly? What did they do?", "They play video games and are on phones. Yet he calls that being animals. Don't have to clean their rooms ( mom's rule not theirs)  Guessing he does want gratefulness for food and necessities of life.\n\nMy sister played video games in bed. Has a doctorate and highly successful.   He's unrealistic.", "Video games and phones all day long, don\u2019t have to have clean rooms.", "Read his previous post. They don\u2019t like going to his weirdly controlling household anymore and mom won\u2019t force them.", "Seriously?  You're blaming the kids for the mom's parenting?    Video games and phones is normal child behavior.  Without parental limits that's going to happen.  That's not even close to being animals though."]}
