Both my parents, my older brother and my SIL, my younger sister Camila (22f) and my husband, my 2 kids (10f and 8m) and I are all planing to go. \n\nWe are planning to stay in a resort for 2 weeks. This will obviously be a bit expensive (at least 2k USD per person and that is an enormous amount of money in my currency). Camila is in her last semester of university and will start a full time job on August. Right now she's not working and lives with my parents (not passing judgment on her for being unemployed because my brother and I went through the same at her age). \n\nCamila called me last week to ask if we could pay for her ticket and accomodation (my parents would pay for food and activities). My husband and I can comfortably afford our family, but adding Camila would put financial pressure on us. I told her that I would discuss it with my husband and then I would call her.\n\nSo my husband and I agreed that we would be willing to pay for her if she would babysit our children on certain occasions. Of course, not every day and without notice, but at least twice a week for two hours for two months. She would basically be the replacement for our current babysitter.\n\nAnyway, I texted her basically saying what I just wrote, and she replied \"Absolutely not.\" So I called her to ask why she was so against this arrangement, which I think benefits both of us: she gets to go on vacation and we have a babysitter we trust and don't spend more than our monthly budget.\n\nCamila said  that we were manipulating her into doing unpaid labor to us and forcing her to say yes because neither our brother or parents could afford to pay for her. She also said that she's way to busy with her last semester of uni and finals. I told her that she could do all of her school stuff in our house, my children are very well behaved and need very little supervision, but she still said that she wouldn't do it. So I then told her that I was very sorry but if she didn't accept then we couldn't pay for her to go on the vacation. \n\nSo now she's incredibly mad at me. But now my mom is also angry with me because she wants to have a family vacation and she knows my husband and I do have the money to pay for Camila, and \"family helps family\", which I agree with, but I believe that help must be reciprocal and right now Camila is not reciprocating that help. My brother and dad just want to settle this down, they are not taking sides.", "created_utc": 1681108067, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12h9kla/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_sisters_vacation/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In fact, she comes out slightly more on top from the whole deal.", "So, \u201cfamily helps family\u201d only when it comes to paying for expensive vacations, but not for childcare. Gotcha! \n\nYour sister is living in another planet Op. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n> Camila said that we were manipulating her into doing unpaid labor to us\n\nIt's not unpaid. She's getting a vacation.\n\n> But now my mom is also angry with me because she wants to have a family vacation\n\nTell them to pay for it, and if they can't then go somewhere cheaper.", "NTA. It's not free labor, it's *prepaid* labor and at a great pay rate even. She is free to turn down the offer if she doesn't feel able to take on a job in addition to school. That's understandable. But there's no call to badmouth you for offering fair and generous terms. That's where she crossed the line over to AH.", "Twice a week for a couple of hours for two months is a pretty good deal considering you get a 2k holiday out of it. NTA, is not your responsibility to pay for her so this was a pretty fair deal.", "NTA at all!!! Your sister is a piece of work, and spurning an incredibly generous offer. Her labor is far from \"unpaid\". Looking at your arrangement, you are asking for approximate 35 hours of labor in return for a $2000 trip. That is close to $60 an hour. That would be an amazing offer for a 22 year old in the US, and I am guessing from the \"my currency\" answer that you live in a lower cost of living country than the US, where the offer is even more generous. \n\nYou are NTA at all. Your sister sucks.", "NTA\n\n4h a week, for let's call it 8 weeks for easy math, that's 32 hours.  For $2k... and she said no.  I hope her new career is going to be as a highly paid neurosurgeon or something if that's the sort of money she TURNS DOWN.", "NTA \n\n>manipulating her into doing unpaid labor\n\nYou are paying her $2000. That's over $60/hour with the arrangement you are proposing.", "NTA that\u2019s 62.5 dollars an hour. 4 hours a week should be manageable for a student.", "NTA\n\nFamily or not, she's not entitled to your money for free, and your parents are also AH if they can't see that.\n\nYou aren't asking her to work for free. Indeed you can easily work out a $ per hour by dividing that $2000 by the number of hours of babysitting you have asked for.\n\nThe number of hours you're asking for is also not going to interfere with her studying, that's ridiculous. \n\nStick to your guns.\n\nIf your parents think someone else should pay for her to attend, let them. If they can't afford it, they should stop mentally spending other people's money.", "Babysit or have her sign a promissory note (legal and all) that she has to pay you back. I bet she has to work more than 35-ish hours to pay off the note. NTA", "NTA; however, you say at least twice a month. Do you also have a max? \n\nOtherwise, why didn't the family plan a cheaper vacation ? And this one after Camila starts working or next year?", "NTA A $2k vacation for 32 hours babysitting is a pretty sweet deal LMAO", "NTA it seems a little outrageous to me that anyone would ask for you to pay $2k. I think the babysitting offer is fair. However, if I was in your situation I would probably suggest all of the family chip in for her and split it.", " NTA and I wish I could sign up for this generous arrangement \ud83c\udf38", "NTA. Your proposal seems totally reasonable. She and your mother are totaly delusional, it\u2019s not like you would pay 200$, but 2000! Don\u2019t fall under pressure to pay for her.", "NTA.  You are asking her to basically babysit for less than 40 hours over 2 mths, and would be paying approx 2000USD for her to go on vacation, that's more than $50 per hr.  I think that's a reasonable offer.  If she chooses not to  accept, that's her decision, you are not a charity and also not obligated to pay for your sister's vacation.", "If family helps family\u2026 Camila has refused to help family so no more family helps family. Camila is an ungrateful asshole.", "NTA. You made a reasonable proposal, she is being a brat.", "NTA : you're not even asking for babysitting during vacation (which I'd have said that was disgusting) but she'd just be paying you back and it's only for 2 months. Too bad for her, your offer is good!", "NTA\nYou need the money for a babysitter. If your sister can not afford the vacation, she either has to work for the money or skip the trip.", "Not an Asshole. I can\u2019t wrap my mind to the fact that she would want you to pay for her holiday? Why? And why say no to the extremely generous offer?", "NTA\n\nYou are offering to pay her roughly $75 per hour to baby sit for you.  That is a hugely generous offer and she should be biting your arm off.", "NTA. You suggested a fair arrangement, effectively paying (extremely well!) in advance for light babysitting. You are the one being manipulated here.", "NTA. It\u2019s not unpaid labour. She\u2019s being paid approx $2000. It just so happens that she isn\u2019t being paid directly in cash, rather via her ticket to vacation with her family. Mum needs to butt out - the entitlement both she and sister feel towards your hard earned money, is really something.", "NTA.\n\nFor this deal, can I babysit your kids please?", "4 hours a week for, what? 8-9 weeks? That works out to about $55/hr she getting \u201cpaid\u201d to cover her trip. NTA at all", "NTA, and shame on your mom for going along with sisters stupidity. Ypu said yourself that yes, you could pay, but it would put financial stress on you... so you came up with a completely fair solution. If that's not good enough for them then tell mom to stuff it, you'll go on a vacation with your partner and kids and have a perfectly fine family vacation without the entitled biddies.", "NTA I don\u2018t know where she takes the unpaid labor from - calculated per hour, she is goong tp receive a pretty gpod hourly rate (9 weeks 4 hrs for 2000).", "NTA.\n\nCan I take her place? I'll do that amount of babysitting for a fully funded vacation.", "NTA, but, like others, I'm wondering why you have to go on such an expensive vacation.", "NTA maybe ESH for the family. The family arranged this vacation knowing camilla is still studying and unemployed so likely will need someone to pay for her to go or she can\u2019t go. Was that thought about when it was planned? Does that make her feel bad to start with? She has asked you to pay you are already spending enough and are entitled to say no as it would put pressure on you financially. But you came up with a solution so you could pay for her and she can work it off so she can go and your finance are ok cos you will save them money. It\u2019s a nice solution except for the normal babysitter losing money for 2 months. I would want to know if camilla is spoilt and use to getting her way, or she\u2019s been put in a situation by bad family planning where she wants to go be with you but also has to study for her last semester and the babysitting feels like too much on top so is asking for help.", "NTA. She thinks family helps family only when it benefits her. At this point, if she changes her mind, the offer shouldn't stand because you can't trust she'd hold to her end of the agreement.", "NTA that's a good offer, I'd take it.", "NAH. Contrary to what others say, babysitting is not a job like others. It doesn't matter how well it pays because it's not for everyone. And you claiming that your kids are well behaved and don't need supervision is ridiculous. If that were the case you wouldn't need a babysitter. Maybe Camila doesn't like children at all. Maybe she really doesn't have time. If she could spend time on a job, maybe she would.\n\nSo while your offer might seem generous to you, it might be something that is impossible for her (be it because she hasn't time or really doesn't want to babysit). You aren't an asshole for proposing this, as it seems fair. But neither is Camila for refusing. Maybe you could discuss other methods of her paying you back in the future.", "ESH. Let's be honest. She doesn't have time for a job right now (as you yourself said). And what are the chances that this 4hours a week won't slide into more and you'll expect her to step up every time you ask (\"advance notice\" doesn't mean you're giving her the power to say \"no\"). \n\nBut you also don't have to pay for her vacation.", "INFO: How much do you pay your current babysitter?", "NAH She asked a favor, you asked a favor in return, she turned that favor down so you turned her favor down. No assholes in the vicinity here, you're both entitled to ask, and you're both entitled to turn one another down. She's not an AH for having feelings about it either, as long as she's not lying to people about it or badmouthing you. She can't control the fact that your mother is mad at you now either, your mother is also entitled to have feelings. Your mom sucks a bit for trying to guilt you about it, but ultimately, I don't think that makes her an AH.", "YTA, both you and your parents. Who sets up a \"family vacation\" that you know full well some of the family can't afford??", "ESH for planning a holiday that you cannot all comfortably afford. Go somewhere cheaper, skip the drama!\n\nBut your mum especially much AH. Wtf, giving you a hard time for not paying for your sister, yet looking past the sister refusing a few hours spent with her nieces and nephews to help you guys in return? \n\nThat mum is really something...", "On the face of it...NTA.\n\nINFO: Have you made arrangements with her like this in the past?  If so, did you live by the terms you set?  Or were there times when you had a sudden emergency and called your sister at the last minute?  Or did you ask her to babysit for a couple of hours only to show up 6 hours later because your activity took longer than expected?  If what I just described sounds like you...then I would change my judgement to you being TA.", "Do you feel her reluctance might be that she fears the two hours a week might become two hours a day and the two hours might slowly become 3 hours, four hours, Friday nights, weekends etc. \n\nHave you thought about organising a formal hours sheet so she can see you won\u2019t move the goalposts after the holiday and jeopardise her degree?", "ESH she was asking for a gift not a job. Say no it's easy. Everyone knows that those couple of hours a week would snowball into many hours ( once you include travelling and have family interactions) it can be really hard to get back into study when you keep starting and stopping. But in saying that if your parents want her there so bad they should pay. Or maybe not arrange a family holiday that is so unsuitable for a broke college student. Also \"help being reciprocal\" is pretty repugnant.", "YTA - she is asking for a favour so there can be a family holiday. If she had time she could get a job, but that is not an option for her (don\u2019t know why but you said you where also in that position) Why make this conditional? She is trying to finish uni, she would be busy and stressed.", "YTA - just for the TWICE a WEEK part,  if it was once a week maybe but TWICE?! while shes finishing school?? honestly if she cant afford to go then, too bad, thats how the cookie crumbles but also the fact that you said for her to do 16 unpaid baby-sittings???? what the heck are you guys doing that you need a babysitter that often???", "You want her to do 2 months free babysitting for a 2 week vacation?
