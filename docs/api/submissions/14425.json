Both my parents, my older brother and my SIL, my younger sister Camila (22f) and my husband, my 2 kids (10f and 8m) and I are all planing to go. \n\nWe are planning to stay in a resort for 2 weeks. This will obviously be a bit expensive (at least 2k USD per person and that is an enormous amount of money in my currency). Camila is in her last semester of university and will start a full time job on August. Right now she's not working and lives with my parents (not passing judgment on her for being unemployed because my brother and I went through the same at her age). \n\nCamila called me last week to ask if we could pay for her ticket and accomodation (my parents would pay for food and activities). My husband and I can comfortably afford our family, but adding Camila would put financial pressure on us. I told her that I would discuss it with my husband and then I would call her.\n\nSo my husband and I agreed that we would be willing to pay for her if she would babysit our children on certain occasions. Of course, not every day and without notice, but at least twice a week for two hours for two months. She would basically be the replacement for our current babysitter.\n\nAnyway, I texted her basically saying what I just wrote, and she replied \"Absolutely not.\" So I called her to ask why she was so against this arrangement, which I think benefits both of us: she gets to go on vacation and we have a babysitter we trust and don't spend more than our monthly budget.\n\nCamila said  that we were manipulating her into doing unpaid labor to us and forcing her to say yes because neither our brother or parents could afford to pay for her. She also said that she's way to busy with her last semester of uni and finals. I told her that she could do all of her school stuff in our house, my children are very well behaved and need very little supervision, but she still said that she wouldn't do it. So I then told her that I was very sorry but if she didn't accept then we couldn't pay for her to go on the vacation. \n\nSo now she's incredibly mad at me. But now my mom is also angry with me because she wants to have a family vacation and she knows my husband and I do have the money to pay for Camila, and \"family helps family\", which I agree with, but I believe that help must be reciprocal and right now Camila is not reciprocating that help. My brother and dad just want to settle this down, they are not taking sides.", "created_utc": 1681108067, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12h9kla/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_sisters_vacation/", "score": 10086, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not free labor, it's *prepaid* labor and at a great pay rate even. She is free to turn down the offer if she doesn't feel able to take on a job in addition to school. That's understandable.

Her labor is far from \"unpaid\". Looking at your arrangement, you are asking for approximate 35 hours of labor in return for a $2000 trip. That is close to $60 an hour. That would be an amazing offer for a 22 year old in the US, and I am guessing from the \"my currency\" answer that you live in a lower cost of living country than the US, where the offer is even more generous. \n\nYou are NTA at all.

You are asking her to basically babysit for less than 40 hours over 2 mths, and would be paying approx 2000USD for her to go on vacation, that's more than $50 per hr.

Ypu said yourself that yes, you could pay, but it would put financial stress on you... so you came up with a completely fair solution.

I'll do that amount of babysitting for a fully funded vacation.", "NTA, but, like others, I'm wondering why you have to go on such an expensive vacation.", "NTA maybe ESH for the family. The family arranged this vacation knowing camilla is still studying and unemployed so likely will need someone to pay for her to go or she can\u2019t go. Was that thought about when it was planned? Does that make her feel bad to start with? She has asked you to pay you are already spending enough and are entitled to say no as it would put pressure on you financially. But you came up with a solution so you could pay for her and she can work it off so she can go and your finance are ok cos you will save them money. It\u2019s a nice solution except for the normal babysitter losing money for 2 months. I would want to know if camilla is spoilt and use to getting her way, or she\u2019s been put in a situation by bad family planning where she wants to go be with you but also has to study for her last semester and the babysitting feels like too much on top so is asking for help.", "NTA. She thinks family helps family only when it benefits her. At this point, if she changes her mind, the offer shouldn't stand because you can't trust she'd hold to her end of the agreement.", "NTA that's a good offer, I'd take it.", "NAH. Contrary to what others say, babysitting is not a job like others. It doesn't matter how well it pays because it's not for everyone. And you claiming that your kids are well behaved and don't need supervision is ridiculous. If that were the case you wouldn't need a babysitter. Maybe Camila doesn't like children at all. Maybe she really doesn't have time. If she could spend time on a job, maybe she would.\n\nSo while your offer might seem generous to you, it might be something that is impossible for her (be it because she hasn't time or really doesn't want to babysit). You aren't an asshole for proposing this, as it seems fair. But neither is Camila for refusing. Maybe you could discuss other methods of her paying you back in the future.", "ESH. Let's be honest. She doesn't have time for a job right now (as you yourself said). And what are the chances that this 4hours a week won't slide into more and you'll expect her to step up every time you ask (\"advance notice\" doesn't mean you're giving her the power to say \"no\"). \n\nBut you also don't have to pay for her vacation.", "INFO: How much do you pay your current babysitter?", "NAH She asked a favor, you asked a favor in return, she turned that favor down so you turned her favor down. No assholes in the vicinity here, you're both entitled to ask, and you're both entitled to turn one another down. She's not an AH for having feelings about it either, as long as she's not lying to people about it or badmouthing you. She can't control the fact that your mother is mad at you now either, your mother is also entitled to have feelings.

The holiday of a lifetime for your parents.\n\nCamilla lives with your parents, but if she doesn't agree to babysit for you, she'll have to stay home while both of your parents, you and your husband and kids, and your other brother and his wife jet off to a 5 star overseas resort.\n\nYTA. If this was just a vacation that you and husband were taking with the kids as a family unit, and Camilla wanted to shoehorn her way in, requiring her to \"work\" for payment of her share of the holiday would be fair enough. It's a generous holiday.\n\nBut your whole family unit is planning this, and because she's focusing on her schooling and not trying to split her attention between school and work, as seems to be the agreement in your family, her choices are stay home alone while everyone goes on this fancy vacation or give in to your demands on her time to \"pay it off\".", "Yeah. Like on the face of it, it's a sweet deal to get a $2k fully paid holiday in exchange for doing a bit of babysitting...\n\nBut then it looks like the whole rest of the family is going. Other brother, sister in law, both parents, OP, his husband and his kids.\n\nSo there's this sweet family vacation that's happening, Camilla is not working right now because she's focusing on uni, which OP hasn't got a problem with because both brothers did at the same age... but it's being dangled over her head that she can't go unless she agrees to babysit for OP and husband. \n\nAnd it's not like Camilla lives on her own in another city and is fully supporting herself. She's living with mum and dad, who will be gone on the vacation.\n\nI think everyone's being a bit shitty to each other here.\n\nAlso, I can see another post where OP says Dad's health hasn't been good in recent years, and mom and brother wanted to stay in a 5 star resort. \n\nSo this whole vacation was set up in a way that Camilla has no choice but to agree to OP demanding she provide babysitting, or she doesn't get to go on this once-in-a-lifetime vacation, possibly the last one their dad will ever get to go on.", "Oh I misread that part about the babysitting, my bad.  Yes, I saw another comment about the hours and pay the current babysitter gets, I get the distinct impression the hours that Camila would be expected to work would be much longer than what OP says here....\n\nOn the face of it OP seems NTA, but deep down I don't like this at all...", "A family vacation  that was planned out of her price range.

It's her parents and brother, so why did OP have to foot the bill? \n\nI guess the parents and brother could do the babysitting instead of Camilla, since they are the ones who decided on the expensive vacation.", "Lol nope", "These are some really good points and this should be higher up for sure.", "\"Dangled over her head\" is a very funny way to twist it. You're just expecting OP to spend 2.000$ that will put a strain on their finances just because, with no reciprocation from Camilla. She doesn't owe him babysitting, but neither do they owe her. If it's that important of a vacation, then the whole family should get together and fund her part.", "If OP pays their normal babysitter, it seems like that free 2K probably won't exist, as it's coming from what they would pay the babysitter. The kids will still need supervision, so they can't just write those costs off.\n\n\n\nI think OP and Camilla's family should pool together to pay for the trip. The family singling out one member that looks financially stable leaves a bad taste in my mouth, especially since Camilla isn't OP'S child. OP has their own children to worry about funding.\n\n\n\nOP'S children should come before someone else's vacation, every time. If an extra 2k would make them struggle, then I think it would be very unfair to ask that cost of OP. Their children are still young and in the house.

Because that's life.\n\n\nYou're not owed parents paying for you to go away with them forever - at some point you become an adult and have to make tough choices about what you can and cannot afford. \n\n\nAnd the rest of your family shouldn't have to compromise on their standard of holiday to accommodate the non working or low income individual. \n\n\nIF they can easily pay for you that's great - but honestly paying for the same family member over and over gets old so I wouldn't expect that to last much beyond once or twice during that period of studying /getting your first job etc\n\n\nBut if they can only afford for themselves - then That's that, your parents don't owe you luxuries into adulthood and your siblings definitely don't owe you anything like that. \n\n\nShe's the youngest (I'm guessing based on the fact all the other siblings are mentioned as having been thru uni) so unfortunately it's her turn to face that cut off of parents being able or willing to pay for you as if you are a child. \n\n\nIt's not stated here but I'd imagine (based on my family dynamic and my friends) as each of the older siblings got to that age there were things they were not included in, that Camilla was despite not being to afford it because she was younger and still 'a child' and I bet Camilla thought nothing of this and figured it was perfectly fair - now it's her turn and she's getting upset. \n\n\nThis is part of growing up, and on the face of it it looks unfair , like she's being singled out and excluded, but she's forgetting about the age and life difference between her and all her siblings - they appear to have married, got jobs, had kids etc they've done the \"we've got no money and can't afford anything\" that Camilla is going through now and have come out the otherside and her turn will come for that to. \n\n\nIt IS fair it's just not happened at the same time for all of them. \n\n\nI would imagine she's looked at OP and figured they're working, have a nice house, couple kids, babysitter, can afford a holiday and thinks covering her costs is easy for them and the response of \"sure but you owe me\" is 'petty' because she's not realising that actually it's not something OP can \"just afford\". \n\n\nThe alternative would be for Camilla to just owe her sister \u00a32k. But without a job and her not planning on getting one - how is she going to pay it back? \n\n\nAlso she didn't actually offer to pay her sister back this money - she literally just called and was like \"can you pay for me?\" \n\n\nShe proposed NOTHING in exchange. No \"I'll pay you back\" no \"I'll do this other thing for you\"\n\n\nJust \"cover me because you have money and I don't\"\n\n\nOP is actually being pretty decent. \nShe could have just said \"sorry we can't afford to\" and I doubt anyone would have given it a second thought. \n\n\nInstead her and her partner have agreed it's a bit mean for Camilla to be left behind and she's recognised her sister has no income and can't afford to actually pay her back, she's recognised she has no job and doesn't want to force her to get one because she studying therefore wouldn't ever really be able to pay her back and she also doesn't want this \"debt\" looming over their relationship.\n\n\nSo she's proposed something Camilla CAN do with very little impact on her life - 2 hours, 2 times a week for 2 months babysitting. \n\n\n(Something tbh most family would do without being paid for but that's separate)\n\n\nAnd Camilla's response was to throw her toys out the pram and go complaining to mum and dad about how unfair it was.\n\n\nShe didn't want a fair exchange, she wanted a free ride. \n\n\nIt's says a hell of a lot about Camilla's maturity. \n\n\nI wouldn't pay for her either - being left behind will be a good lesson for her on the realities of being an adult. \n\n\n(NTA)", "See OP's other comments.

To OP, the parents and older brother.\n\nLet\u2019s first summarise what I gathered from OP\u2019s post and comments. So Camila is in her last semester of Mechatronic Engineering, busy with classes and finals. She is living with the parents and is not expected to work. The father is sick and the mother, getting older. Their dream is too go to a fancy 5 stars resort abroad.\n\nFirst, to all of those shaming Camila when was the last time you were in Uni? One of my friend is doing Electrical Engineering, he is busy BUSY. From what O know engineering students have a lot of work (and sometimes real unpaid work in a lab). Even worse during finals. I used to go to the Science library during the exam period and some students would pull all-nighters several nights in a row. Try to imagine how busy Camila can be. And there\u2019s a big difference between working in her own home and having to be semi-concentrated because of kids.\n\nSecond, I don\u2019t think Camila expressed herself properly when she said she would be doing unpaid work. And to those saying NTA and bringing up how well it\u2019s \u201cpaid\u201d. Why would she need to do baby sitting for a family vacation that she had no say in organising? She\u2019s not being capricious. Her father is sick, it could be their last vacations yet her family chose a hotel that she clearly can\u2019t afford. And her brother uses it against her. Imagine \u201cyou cannot go to the last vacation with our father because you refuse to baby sit my kids\u201d. What a nice family.\n\nFinally, the parents should pay. The mother (and older brother) wants to go to this 5 star hotel but doesn\u2019t want to pay for her youngest daughter? WTF? OP should not be forced to pay for Camila.

I cannot be sure, but I get the feeling the mother is manipulative and it seems like she purposely set her ~~daughters~~ children up against each other.\n\nIf you want a family vacation with every family member, you make sure to choose one every member can afford.

Her own family gave her some shitty choices. On purpose. (I don't believe you \"accidentally\" plan a vacation one family member cannot afford, no one is that dense).\n\nCamila comes across as entitled because of the \"unpaid labor\" comment, but, and I cannot be sure, I get the feeling all of this is part of larger family dynamics and someone is pulling strings.\n\nedit: OP is male, not female, sorry!", "Excellent point-- she needs to be staying home studying not travelling.", "but in that case, she shouldn't go on holiday and should spend that time studying.", "Full time students with no part time nor full time job has a lotttt more free time than you think.

Staying in a 4 star hotel for the vacation or even for at least the first week and second week in a 5 star (for mom's request) would mean it's easier for the family to pitch in for the youngest sibling's cost. Or at least ask her to babysit right AFTER she is done with her final semester, like 8 days straight instead of stretching those days out in two months and the current babysitter can take that time as vacation or watch temporarily some else (sister probably won't get a job and start at the job within a week after her finals).", "They can\u2019t afford to pay for the sister though, not that that should matter", "Also because she isn't a childminder, she isn't being offered to do her job, and at 3 times a week she's being offered $40 an hour assuming they stick to 2 hours and only 3 times a week which I doubt on both.

That's lazy. \nDid she offer to pay backt the money in the future? No, she expects to get it for nothing; lazy.", "What? Where do you get that? It was clearly stated that sister was in university and that she isn't currently working. I don't see anything implying OP thinks sis is \"doing nothing\".", "Because it's binary to either pay for your vacation or stay home and study.  LOL she's not being \"left behind\" in a burning building.  She's an adult--and if it's important to her parents to have a \"family vacation\" they have many options.  Reschedule after daughter is working and can afford to go, or choose a vacation that daughter can afford, or Mom and Dad can pay for daughter to go or loan her the money.    \n\n\nBrother's offer was generous--daughter chose to decline the offer.", "I'm glad someone finally said this. OP is NTA, but as a parent of a young adult my first reaction was, what kind of parents plan a fancy vacation they can't afford to take their child on? Their child who lives at home and attends school full time? And is like, \"kiddo, why don't you call around the family and see if anyone can help you pay?\"\n\nThe fuck?\n\nSister is being annoying about the babysitting offer, which I agree she should take, but her response may be an emotional reaction to feeling embarrassed over being the only one in the family who has to set up a go fund me to attend the family vacation, so I still feel sorry for her.", "Funny how the parents are family but passing the buck on \u201cfamily helps family\u201d", "We just appreciate that you did the work.", "What, because every country in the world has school holidays on the same dates??

Don't kink shame.", "Yeah the edit didn't explain anything further lol", "I wasn\u2019t blessed with a money tree and had to work a part-time job through all four years of college. I still managed to pass all of my final exams and graduated with a 3.8 GPA. \n\nI think OP\u2019s sister would be just fine. It\u2019s four hours/week for a whopping two months ffs.", "I, and probably the sister, suspect it won't be 2 hours twice a week. They'll pull the \"We paid for it\" card every time they want to do something. They're used to having a full-time babysitter, and I believe they will treat her as such. They expect her to study for exams while watching the kids? She also wants a vacation. I think there are some missing reasons here.", "The kids are 8 and 10. They\u2019re not toddlers. At those ages they are incredibly self-sufficient. \n\nSister can study/do homework WHILE getting paid to be there. My newly 8yo can happily occupy herself for hours while I work, when needed", "Maybe a \"country\" thing . In mine , if the university student doesnt live at home , only the very well off families can afford to fully pay for  them . Even the ones living at home will likely need to have a part time job ( or  a full time during the summer ) to cover some of their personal expenses .", "Babysit less?  It's 2 times out of the week for 2 hours for 2 months.  How much less is there?  It's around 32 hours for 2 months, that's like 1 day of a part-time job.", "See that\u2019s totally reasonable!  I really think OP\u2019s family put him in a terrible spot and just expected him to pay thousands of dollars for a sibling\u2019s vacation without question.", "Yes and it should be the parents paying them back not Camilla", "It\u2019s not really nothing in return. It\u2019s your family, you should want to spend time with them. It\u2019s the same reason he\u2019s going to pay for his kids who can\u2019t pay for themselves. Yes he\u2019s not responsible for his sister the way he is for his kids but I hope that helps put into perspective. It\u2019s not like this is hurting OP, he can afford to bring her without her having to babysit. He literally just wants something in exchange which honestly just feels like he doesn\u2019t care that much about his sister being there.", "But it doesn't sound like OP is planning it, so how can he be the AH for not wanting to put his family in financial strain?", "I finished my last semester of engineering school working a full time job, I didn't ask for a handout like the sister. I don't know why you are projecting because this is a good deal, she either affords it or she \"works\" for it, people don't have to wait for her life to start for them to do things, there's a lot of things I wasn't able to do because I was busy with school and that's life.", "Then arrange for the parents to pay them back", "And his Samuel Clemens", "This comment reminded me of a situation that happened to me. My grandmother once offered a last minute invite a few days before the trip was going to happen to take me on a vacation with her to meet extended family in Puerto Rico that I had never met before.

The kicker was at the end of the phone call when I was all excited and ready to go she was like, \u201cOh but you have to pay me $600 right now for the ticket.\u201d As an adult, I\u2019d have jumped on it, but I was 13 and literally couldn\u2019t legally get a job because I was too young, so literally had zero way to pay for it except begging my parents who understandably said no because they had bills to pay to take care of my siblings and I.

I don't know if promissory notes are the same everywhere, but my understanding is you can let those ride for a long time and if OP took her to court for the money the family would probably implode.

Why do your parents think it\u2019s more fair that you pay for 5 people than it is they pay for 3? \n\nThere are perfectly reasonable explanations for each of these questions, but I do think they\u2019re relevant, and I think the conflict here is that people aren\u2019t on the same page as to all those answers. \n\nI see this from your POV, I do, but from her POV: watch her niblings or be uninvited from family vacation. \n\nA lot of people have pointed out that financially, her babysitting doesn\u2019t make a dent in the cost\u2026 unfortunately that also makes the act increasingly symbolic. Is paying for her vacation helping her out\u2026 or helping out your parents? Why can\u2019t you split the cost between you and your parents? Wouldn\u2019t that be less of a financial burden than offsetting babysitting? \n\nLook, I don\u2019t think the offer is terrible; it makes sense and seems more than fair. However. She has every right to decline it, regardless of the fairness of the terms. Twice a week can be a lot if you\u2019re dealing with homework and studying, having a social life and clubs. And if in person you said \u201cfor about 2 months\u201d that could easily be interpreted as \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d, which makes her comment about unpaid labor make a lot more sense. I wouldn\u2019t want to be in someone\u2019s debt just in order to spend time with my family. \n\nI highly doubt it was your sisters idea to have such an expensive vacation, and are you going to pick a resort over your sibling?", "YTA\n\nWay to make anything about family a transaction.

No children are.", "I'm going w/ a unpopular YTA. You planned a family vacation your sister couldn't possibly afford and your parents couldn't cover for her. You created a situation where she will feel left out b/c she can't come, and will get pressure from your family to  attend, but then you said you could pay, but make it conditional on her doing stuff for you. So you set up a situation where sis either can't come, goes into debt or is at your bec and call over to be able to attend this vacation and you think you aren't the bad guy for doing this? \n\nYour offer is vauge enough that if I were your sister, I would feel like I was being set up as you and your wife's holiday slave. Before you say only 2x a week for x hours - you uave a lot of \"at leasts\" in there and you don't say how much notice is required before you expect her to or if ahe has pre-existing plans that she can say when asked.

The final semester of college? My final semester I literally wouldn't have been able to work **at least** 2 days a weeks, even with those short hours, even if those hours were set up around my schedule. (But I feel that the babysitting is 100% around your schedule, and her class and study schedule just doesn't matter at all.) It wouldn't be possible, and if I have to choose, I'm choosing my own education every time. I also don't blame her for being mad. I know how mad I was when I was fresh out of college, and days later my family went on a \"family\" vacation without me, because I couldn't afford my own tickets because I was a college student. It's not a secret that college students don't have the money for things like that, whoever planned this trip knowingly excluded her from attending. You can claim whatever you like, but the fact of the matter is that this was very foreseeable, and is not at all a surprise, so whoever planned this is the asshole, because they purposely excluded her. \n\nYou're not the asshole for not wanting to give her money. \n\nYou are the asshole **if** you were involved in planning this trip though, as that would put you in the group of people that was knowingly excluding her. My parents and sister have been invited to two of their dream vacations since then, which I went to without them. I invited them with no time left to get a ticket or book a room, after they've already spent money on another large expense. After the second time they apologized and said they realized how much it hurt to be invited like that when everyone in the room knew it was a fake invite because of the financial situation. For a huge number of reasons outside of this post, I did NOT accept their apology, and our relationship is still icy at best. Best part is, I could have bought the three of them tickets and shared my room with them, I let them know I could afford it, but that I was choosing not to, the same way they could afford to take me and chose not to. I let them know (similar to what they did to me) that I planned it months ago, but was only letting them know at the last minute, the same way they did to me (everyone got exactly one month of notice for the vacation we were 'invited' on). Nothing like never being truly invited on the family vacation to let you know they don't care about you at all, and Camila was never actually invited based on your story, she was an afterthought at best.", "Planning such an expensive vacation as your dad\u2019s farewell trip is what made you TA, not the fact that there are stipulations to paying for her. The whole thing is a mess, but if she doesn\u2019t agree with it and doesn\u2019t go, that\u2019s also a mess. You were pretty vague about how often she would need to babysit, and whilst I believe you aren\u2019t lying, a lot of people would abuse that. It\u2019s tricky. A trip that everyone could afford makes way more sense.", "YTA a bit. Less for the action, more for the way you're handling it.

If they're not true, you're just straight-up TA. Not because you're obligated to pay it, but because if you don't want to pay it you should just tell her instead of all the gymnastics.)\n\nMost importantly, you're being dismissive of her need to focus on her studies in the final part of her senior year, handwaving it away with \"just do it here.\" No matter how well-behaved your kids are it would be irresponsible of her to ignore them, and she needs to be able to focus without being interrupted whenever the kids need something, in an environment that's conducive to her focus. She may even need special things sometimes that your house doesn't have, depending on the degree -- computer software, library books, equipment, etc.\n\nFamily helping being mutual should mean that you help her now, she helps later when she has an opportunity.

But it would be impossible for us without dipping into the savings. That is why we are asking her to babysit, to save our current nanny's salary. If we paid out of pocket right now with the promise that she would pay us before the end of the year, we would be financially constricted for at least 3 months.\n\nYes I agree we were stupid for planning this without taking into account her financial situation.

Camila is in a very tough degree and the babysitting would coincide with the end of her last semester. That is her finals and all end of the year projects. So essentially one of the heaviest loads of her career. Adding a part time job, albeit a small one, can be one too many plates.\n\nFurther context is that the father's health isn't good and he dreamed of this vacation. This is a once in a lifetime trip/the last family vacation with the father. The mother and brother are insisting on 5 star accommodations. So Camila is looking at a family vacation where she wasn't thought of in the slightest. Where the only way she can go is to over extend herself and hope it doesn't cause issues with her education.

You can't reasonably pay more for this vacation than you already are without cutting costs somewhere else. If there was no other context, this would be a fair deal for your sister. However, with the context that your sister is a jobless college student focusing on her studies and not an independent adult with income to pay for vacations, and this is a major family vacation - maybe the last one your dad can go on, you all should be making sure everyone can go. In your comments where you've explained this extra context, your family is essentially telling your sister \"We care more about the destination and 5 star hotel than including you on this trip\" which sucks. For example, when my family has a family reunion we try to plan around people's schedules, not make things expensive, have shared accommodations, and the grandparents (heads of the family) have helped people pay for it. We do not tell people to beg money from other family members, that is rude. We aren't always able to make it so the timing works for everyone, but we definitely don't want money to be the reason someone can't go.\n\nIf your mom and dad really want to go on a really expensive vacation for his bucket list, maybe just those two should've gone and the entire family could have had a larger and cheaper vacation before or after. This isn't all on you, and it's not all on you to pay for your sister to go, but please do not have \"Dad's potentially last special vacation with the family\" be something your sister can't attend because it's too expensive for her to afford and too expensive for all of you to help her attend. She will probably resent being excluded and missing those important memories with Dad, and feel left out. Please talk with your family and see if everyone is able to pitch in to help her go, and maybe try to make the trip a little cheaper if hotels and stuff like that aren't locked in yet. Your sister's poor reaction to your offer is probably because of how apparent it is that the family is excluding her and not being considerate of her.\n\nSo NTA for trying to help your sister in a way you can afford, but the rest of your family is being pretty inconsiderate of her.

I would never ask any friend or family to pay the adult me for babysitting full stop (or my vacation for that matter, but I digress). She's not in high school. Your offer was very generous.", "NTA. She wants a $2k freebie and isn't even willing to give up a few hours out of her week to babysit? I don't care what she's doing. For $2k, she can make time. College isn't that busy. Its not hard to stay away from a party or two.", "My exact thought! She would actually be getting paid a very handsome amount up front, then she does the work to cover that. How she finds this unreasonable is anyone\u2019s guess. Sounds like the youngest and expects everyone to cater to her with no strings attached.", "On top of that, most kids are pretty self sufficient at 8 and 10. OP's sister is passing up an extremely generous offer.", "Yup and given this math, I'd be like, when you decide it's a good deal after all, it'll be months of babysitting. Choosing beggar. NTA", "That would have taken me three business days with a calculator. You\u2019re doing amazing sweetie!", "This is part of the reason that I say OP is not TA.\n\nClearly the family feels entitled to OPs money, and they are all now just pissy that OP didn't roll over like a good boy & hand over his hard earned cash to pay for Camilla.", "Yes, this, please!!! Probably the sister needs certain things to be able to study plus no interruptions from kids or anyone else. It is absolutely understandable that she cannot babysit while she is studying. The family could have chosen something else where everybody could go.\n\nAlso, OP says \"at least\" two days a week, but we all know what that means. It will most likely be more. I wouldn't agree to that either, especially at the end of my degree where a lot is on stake.", "I agree. This is an ESH situation in my opinion.", "I dislike kids and so would I!", "I missed the part where OP was judgey about his sister being unemployed, could you point out where they said that? Their original post literally says the opposite, was it in a comment?", "OP is a man, just as a heads up.", "This is absolutely reasonable enough, and I can't believe sister is throwing a fit about it (I also kinda can't believe she went to a sibling and said \"hey, can you pay for me?\", and it wasn't even \"can you loan me the money so I can go on the family trip?\") but now that she's said no and been so intense in her reaction... I don't believe, if she changes her mind and says yes to the babysitting, that she'll end up doing it for longer than a few weeks. The problem with this agreement is if sister ends up getting the money for the holiday, she's already proven that OP's feelings aren't important enough for her to actually follow through, and her parents have proven that they'll take sister's side.", "ESH\n\nYour family planned a vacation only some of you could afford, and instead of pitching together to ensure *everyone* can join in, when your sister asked for help *you* put strings on it at the last minute.\n\nIf she's being entitled, you are also being manipulative.\n\nLive within your means.\n\n**edit typo", "AND the kids are old enough to watch themselves so its even easier!", "Ah, I have now seen your edits and comments - my apologies for interpreting what you had written in this way. \n\nI think that you are NTA and have been put in a very difficult situation where it would be very unfortunate for your sister not to go on this holiday which is important to your whole family, but she is obviously unable to pay for it and that responsibility has been quite rudely and unfairly passed onto you.\n\nIn my view, if it would be possible for other family members to offer some portion of your sister\u2019s holiday cost, so that it is not solely you paying for her, that would be much fairer. Perhaps her parents could gift a portion as a graduation/end of college gift. \n\nHowever it still seems to be on you to pay all or most of it, and saving money by having your sister babysit in return is a logical solution and a very generous offer. I would attempt to explain to her just how generous this is (the money per hours that many have already calculated here) and that you will not impede on her ability to study or make her more stressed.\n\nI wish you the best of luck, and I hope that your whole family is able to go on this holiday and that you all enjoy yourselves without too much more arguing or with you having to pay a large amount of money that you will not get back.", "I know I wonder if they instead had said, we will pay you 62 an hour and advance it to you so you can cover the cost of your vacation?\n\nI\u2019m betting the exact same bitchery.", "Lol I'm too lazy to read apparently, but that doesn't change anything about my response", "I love the word niblings, I wish it had been around when mine were little.", "I keep thinking of The Fast and The Furious every time I read: \u201cFamily\u201d on this thread \ud83d\ude02", "OP needs to send this to her, because apparently a college educated person needs help understanding that this is a fantastic deal", ">mechatronics engineering\n\nIt's a thing. It's a combo computer science, mechanical engineering degree. Sort of an offshoot on an EECS degree.", "It\u2019s ridiculous to ask her to rearrange her schedule 3 times a week in her last semester.", "Definitely stick with no paying. She\u2019s basically saying \u201cput yourself into a possible financial hardship so I can go on vacation for free\u201d. It\u2019s not considerate of you and your family. \n\nHow is it free labor? You are literally giving her $2k. How fair is it for you to be out that money? She\u2019s very entitled. Pretty sure she gets it from how mom treats her\u2026 as the baby of the family. \n\nAlso if your mom is so upset by it then she needs to figure out a way to pay for the trip for your sister. Shouldn\u2019t be your only responsibility to ensure she gets there. \n\nNTA.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not a book, it\u2019s an Orwellian novel on Stalinism! And spoiler alert, it sucks!\u201d", "Uh... no it's not, it's from 1984, the book about pigs. 1984 has always been a book about pigs, and 2 + 2 has always equaled 5", "Sugarless daddies haha", "62.50/hr is still hella good and I\u2019d make friends with the kids quick.", "Yeah, that's what I'd be leery of.", "Agree. Mom should pay or she should have found a cheaper vacation. If the most important thing is to just be together, it doesn't have to be this expensive.", "I currently babysit for $5 an hour. Sign me up!", "Where did OP discredit what her future profession is? \n\nAre you referring to this comment? \n\n\u201cNo, she's not a neurosurgeon. She is graduating with a degree in mechatronics engineering (I don't know if that is the word in English). I don't really know what her work will consist of, but I do know that her career has a lot of potential to grow.
