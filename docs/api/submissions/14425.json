Both my parents, my older brother and my SIL, my younger sister Camila (22f) and my husband, my 2 kids (10f and 8m) and I are all planing to go. \n\nWe are planning to stay in a resort for 2 weeks. This will obviously be a bit expensive (at least 2k USD per person and that is an enormous amount of money in my currency). Camila is in her last semester of university and will start a full time job on August. Right now she's not working and lives with my parents (not passing judgment on her for being unemployed because my brother and I went through the same at her age). \n\nCamila called me last week to ask if we could pay for her ticket and accomodation (my parents would pay for food and activities). My husband and I can comfortably afford our family, but adding Camila would put financial pressure on us. I told her that I would discuss it with my husband and then I would call her.\n\nSo my husband and I agreed that we would be willing to pay for her if she would babysit our children on certain occasions. Of course, not every day and without notice, but at least twice a week for two hours for two months. She would basically be the replacement for our current babysitter.\n\nAnyway, I texted her basically saying what I just wrote, and she replied \"Absolutely not.\" So I called her to ask why she was so against this arrangement, which I think benefits both of us: she gets to go on vacation and we have a babysitter we trust and don't spend more than our monthly budget.\n\nCamila said  that we were manipulating her into doing unpaid labor to us and forcing her to say yes because neither our brother or parents could afford to pay for her. She also said that she's way to busy with her last semester of uni and finals. I told her that she could do all of her school stuff in our house, my children are very well behaved and need very little supervision, but she still said that she wouldn't do it. So I then told her that I was very sorry but if she didn't accept then we couldn't pay for her to go on the vacation. \n\nSo now she's incredibly mad at me. But now my mom is also angry with me because she wants to have a family vacation and she knows my husband and I do have the money to pay for Camila, and \"family helps family\", which I agree with, but I believe that help must be reciprocal and right now Camila is not reciprocating that help. My brother and dad just want to settle this down, they are not taking sides.", "created_utc": 1681108067, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12h9kla/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_sisters_vacation/", "score": 442, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not free labor, it's *prepaid* labor and at a great pay rate even. She is free to turn down the offer if she doesn't feel able to take on a job in addition to school. That's understandable.

Her labor is far from \"unpaid\". Looking at your arrangement, you are asking for approximate 35 hours of labor in return for a $2000 trip. That is close to $60 an hour. That would be an amazing offer for a 22 year old in the US, and I am guessing from the \"my currency\" answer that you live in a lower cost of living country than the US, where the offer is even more generous. \n\nYou are NTA at all.

You are asking her to basically babysit for less than 40 hours over 2 mths, and would be paying approx 2000USD for her to go on vacation, that's more than $50 per hr.

Ypu said yourself that yes, you could pay, but it would put financial stress on you... so you came up with a completely fair solution.

I'll do that amount of babysitting for a fully funded vacation.", "NTA, but, like others, I'm wondering why you have to go on such an expensive vacation.", "NTA maybe ESH for the family. The family arranged this vacation knowing camilla is still studying and unemployed so likely will need someone to pay for her to go or she can\u2019t go. Was that thought about when it was planned? Does that make her feel bad to start with? She has asked you to pay you are already spending enough and are entitled to say no as it would put pressure on you financially. But you came up with a solution so you could pay for her and she can work it off so she can go and your finance are ok cos you will save them money. It\u2019s a nice solution except for the normal babysitter losing money for 2 months. I would want to know if camilla is spoilt and use to getting her way, or she\u2019s been put in a situation by bad family planning where she wants to go be with you but also has to study for her last semester and the babysitting feels like too much on top so is asking for help.", "NTA. She thinks family helps family only when it benefits her. At this point, if she changes her mind, the offer shouldn't stand because you can't trust she'd hold to her end of the agreement.", "NTA that's a good offer, I'd take it.", "NAH. Contrary to what others say, babysitting is not a job like others. It doesn't matter how well it pays because it's not for everyone. And you claiming that your kids are well behaved and don't need supervision is ridiculous. If that were the case you wouldn't need a babysitter. Maybe Camila doesn't like children at all. Maybe she really doesn't have time. If she could spend time on a job, maybe she would.\n\nSo while your offer might seem generous to you, it might be something that is impossible for her (be it because she hasn't time or really doesn't want to babysit). You aren't an asshole for proposing this, as it seems fair. But neither is Camila for refusing. Maybe you could discuss other methods of her paying you back in the future.", "ESH. Let's be honest. She doesn't have time for a job right now (as you yourself said). And what are the chances that this 4hours a week won't slide into more and you'll expect her to step up every time you ask (\"advance notice\" doesn't mean you're giving her the power to say \"no\"). \n\nBut you also don't have to pay for her vacation.", "INFO: How much do you pay your current babysitter?", "NAH She asked a favor, you asked a favor in return, she turned that favor down so you turned her favor down. No assholes in the vicinity here, you're both entitled to ask, and you're both entitled to turn one another down. She's not an AH for having feelings about it either, as long as she's not lying to people about it or badmouthing you. She can't control the fact that your mother is mad at you now either, your mother is also entitled to have feelings.

She's living with mum and dad, who will be gone on the vacation.\n\nI think everyone's being a bit shitty to each other here.\n\nAlso, I can see another post where OP says Dad's health hasn't been good in recent years, and mom and brother wanted to stay in a 5 star resort. \n\nSo this whole vacation was set up in a way that Camilla has no choice but to agree to OP demanding she provide babysitting, or she doesn't get to go on this once-in-a-lifetime vacation, possibly the last one their dad will ever get to go on.", "Oh I misread that part about the babysitting, my bad.  Yes, I saw another comment about the hours and pay the current babysitter gets, I get the distinct impression the hours that Camila would be expected to work would be much longer than what OP says here....\n\nOn the face of it OP seems NTA, but deep down I don't like this at all...", "A family vacation  that was planned out of her price range. She asked for a gift not a job. He could have just said no. He already said she\u2019s busy with school and can\u2019t have a job so how could she take on the roll of his sitter?", "The part where he said 2 months twice a week for a few hours? Because that\u2019s still 2 months of babysitting.", "School is more than just lectures and she didn\u2019t ask for a job she asked for a gift. All he had to say was no not orchestrate a scenario where she\u2019s working for him.", "I\u2019ll do it for 50 bucks ph.\ud83e\udd29", "Sorry, I should be sleeping and not trying to reddit. Yes, that should most definitely have been 32, not 16. It still works out to $62.50 per hour, which is, indeed, quite generous.", "Especially if it's in some lower COL area which it likely is based on the comment about currency.", "Yes, it is 32. I'm just a moron.", "Sorry, my math was wrong because my brain is dumb. It works out to 32 his in total, for a rate of $62.50 per hour.", "Nah, agreements like this are bullshit as nothing is written and it's all based on good faith, with one side already indebted. It's a shit position to be in.", "I think the \"whole family unit\" should help pay, not just OP.", "Wouldn\u2019t that make the parents the problem?  Who plans an expensive vacation with a dependent child that they can\u2019t afford to bring along, just to expect an older sibling to cover two thousand dollars of expenses for nothing in return?  \n\nImagine if your parents planned a family vacation and demanded you foot the bill for a younger sibling or else they have to miss out and it\u2019s all your fault.", "It's not OP that's making the vacation so expensive though. It's her parents and brother, so why did OP have to foot the bill? \n\nI guess the parents and brother could do the babysitting instead of Camilla, since they are the ones who decided on the expensive vacation.", "Lol nope", "These are some really good points and this should be higher up for sure.", "\"Dangled over her head\" is a very funny way to twist it. You're just expecting OP to spend 2.000$ that will put a strain on their finances just because, with no reciprocation from Camilla. She doesn't owe him babysitting, but neither do they owe her. If it's that important of a vacation, then the whole family should get together and fund her part.", "If OP pays their normal babysitter, it seems like that free 2K probably won't exist, as it's coming from what they would pay the babysitter. The kids will still need supervision, so they can't just write those costs off.\n\n\n\nI think OP and Camilla's family should pool together to pay for the trip. The family singling out one member that looks financially stable leaves a bad taste in my mouth, especially since Camilla isn't OP'S child. OP has their own children to worry about funding.\n\n\n\nOP'S children should come before someone else's vacation, every time. If an extra 2k would make them struggle, then I think it would be very unfair to ask that cost of OP. Their children are still young and in the house. If money is so easy to get, the rest of the family should help cough up that 2k.\n\n\n\nWhy does is all come down on *OP* to pay?", ">So this whole vacation was set up in a way that Camilla has no choice but to agree to OP demanding she provide babysitting, or she doesn't get to go on this once-in-a-lifetime vacation, possibly the last one their dad will ever get to go on.\n\nDepends on how long this was set up ahead of time to get finances and time off in order. Which means Camilla could have had months ahead of time to try to figure out how she'd pay to go along. At 4 months out that's about 16 bucks a day.", "She was offered a job that would have paid her up front at a very good rate, and would have allowed her to go. She rejected it, which shows she expected to get it for free.", "Yeah well that makes you think AH too", "OMG YOURE STUDYING HUMANITARIAN AID AND YOURE TRYING TO GUTTERSTOMP ME?\n\nI hold concerns for vulnerable people you will eventually come across.", "I'm sorry I didn't explain myself better. No, if Camila decides to babysit then we wouldn't use our current babysitter for the two months it would take us to save the amount needed for the vacation, that what I meant by replacement. Sorry for the confusion.", "A family vacation that she could have worked for, to pay her own way.\n\n\nIf she is too busy to get a job to pay her own way, then she is too busy to go on vacation.\n\n\nAnd just because she asked for a gift (a *TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR* gift), it doesn\u2019t mean she is entitled to it, nor is OP obligated to say yes. \n\n\nShe then accused OP of trying to get unpaid labour from her, and complained to the family as though he was being unfair.", "Yes it\u2019s still 2 months babysitting but for just 32 hours, or maybe 40 hours give or take out of 1440 hours. If you just say 2 months it sounds like full 2 months with 5-8 hours of babysitting 5-7 days a week", "No it\u2019s not,  it\u2019s about 16+ hours over 2 months", "I think u/kade_void18 would probably still be a mildly adequate sitter for $62.50.", "I mean\u2026 only if you have a shitty relationship with your family? If I made an agreement like this with someone in my family, and they flipped it after the fact, I\u2019d just tell them no and stick to the pre-agreed time.", "Ok what's to stop the sister from saying provisional yes but she wants this in writing so they all have the agreed upon rules of the game to cut down on bad feelings. \n\nMuch like getting a prenup to avoid a messy divorce when everyone might be looking to hurt the other party doing simple draft of agreements for this just make it so nobody can try to act in bad faith later.", "Parents already are helping with some of the expenses", "Which is also a fair reply. My answer was based entirely on the OP's question of asking if he's the asshole for refusing to pay *unless* Camilla babysits.\n\nIn which case, given the context of this vacation then yeah he is still the asshole IMO. If the question asked was \"AITA for insisting the whole family share the cost of bringing my sister on a luxury family vacation\" then my answer would have been NTA.", "You're right, and that's something that came across my mind but I didn't put it into my posts.\n\nMy call of OP being an asshole is based entirely on him dangling the vacation over Camilla's head in exchange for her babysitting, which is the question he asked.\n\nThe rest of the family are assholes for expecting OP and his husband to pay for Camilla alone.\n\nIf OP had said \"We can't afford to pay for Camilla outright, so we have a few options: a) We pay for Camilla, she pays us back by babysitting for a while and we cut back on childcare costs elsewhere. b) We pay for Camilla, but she has to pay us back immediately out of her first few paycheques from her new job when it starts, we'll work out a payment plan or c) We can't afford to pay for Camilla ourselves, how can we as a family afford to bring her. Parents, bigger bro, let's work out how to share the costs between all of us\" then he would entirely be NTA. It gives Camilla options, not just putting the onus of babysitting on her with no other choices, and it also pushes back on the rest of the family to be like hey, we all planned this vacation together, how about we help Camilla together.\n\nBut the question asked was \"AITA for telling my sister she has to babysit in exchange for this family vacation\" and the rest of the context around the question is very telling, and why I think OP is being the asshole.", "I do agree here. Something in return could be expected. But not babysitting.", "So her actual expected commitment would be 2hrs five days a week, plus drive time?", "So, your current sitter would hypothetically not be neeed for 2 months and lose a large chunck of her income. Are you sure you can get her back after that time?", "Then they try and guilt you with the hol8day and about how it's still a great deal, they continue to push it, you have absolutely no power in that situation. It's like lending family or friends money, it just puts you in a bad position as its too open to abuse", "Did you miss the part where OP points out that paying for Camilla will put a strain on his financial situation? Because what you are essentially saying here is that OP should pay for Camilla & put himself under financial stress.\n\n\nHe has offered a solution that will allow him to pay for Camilla (allowing her to join), without straining his financial situation.", "Well it could be that only thing that works for them. I personally won't give out cash gifts or loan people anything more then $20.", "Asking for 2k$ is not a small favour, more so when it will compromise OP\u2019s financial position. OP still agreed to give her sister 2k, with the only condition of babysitting a few hours so that he financially takes a smaller hit, so no, it is not AH move", "I don\u2019t brag, I show others it can be done. \n\nI make it a point to demonstrate to others not to be a pathetic turd with a bad attitude and weak resolve. \n\nI do this because someone like me showed me it was possible and without this knowledge, I\u2019d be a little shit kicker with, again, a bad attitude. Just like you.", "2 hours per day for five days a week is not 20hr/week\u2026.it is only 10hr/week. So that makes it 40hr/month. That makes it 30/hr", "OP is not in the US though (they mention being in a \u201cthird world country\u201d and that 2k usd is a lot in his currency, so the babysitter pay is likely also quite a lot.", "No, they said 2 hours, 2x a week. Just because they have a current sitter doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s for 5 days a week.", "Let\u2019s say you are right, and it\u2019s a bad deal.  Does that mean the sister should still get a two thousand dollar vacation for free, and if not should the sister be angry with OP for not paying?\n\nBecause I\u2019m fine with the sister turning down the offer if she says \u201coh well, I wish I could have gone but I can\u2019t afford it and don\u2019t want to babysit.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the part where the sister is MAD that she doesn\u2019t get a free 2k trip that makes this ridiculous.", "Do you even realise you're here *making shit up in your head*, then *making it FACT*, then verbalising your thoughts as facts?!?\n\nWild.", "I think you\u2019re projecting", "You\u2019re projecting.", "Sounds like you just have suck friends and family."]}
