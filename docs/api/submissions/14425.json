Both my parents, my older brother and my SIL, my younger sister Camila (22f) and my husband, my 2 kids (10f and 8m) and I are all planing to go. \n\nWe are planning to stay in a resort for 2 weeks. This will obviously be a bit expensive (at least 2k USD per person and that is an enormous amount of money in my currency). Camila is in her last semester of university and will start a full time job on August. Right now she's not working and lives with my parents (not passing judgment on her for being unemployed because my brother and I went through the same at her age). \n\nCamila called me last week to ask if we could pay for her ticket and accomodation (my parents would pay for food and activities). My husband and I can comfortably afford our family, but adding Camila would put financial pressure on us. I told her that I would discuss it with my husband and then I would call her.\n\nSo my husband and I agreed that we would be willing to pay for her if she would babysit our children on certain occasions. Of course, not every day and without notice, but at least twice a week for two hours for two months. She would basically be the replacement for our current babysitter.\n\nAnyway, I texted her basically saying what I just wrote, and she replied \"Absolutely not.\" So I called her to ask why she was so against this arrangement, which I think benefits both of us: she gets to go on vacation and we have a babysitter we trust and don't spend more than our monthly budget.\n\nCamila said  that we were manipulating her into doing unpaid labor to us and forcing her to say yes because neither our brother or parents could afford to pay for her. She also said that she's way to busy with her last semester of uni and finals. I told her that she could do all of her school stuff in our house, my children are very well behaved and need very little supervision, but she still said that she wouldn't do it. So I then told her that I was very sorry but if she didn't accept then we couldn't pay for her to go on the vacation. \n\nSo now she's incredibly mad at me. But now my mom is also angry with me because she wants to have a family vacation and she knows my husband and I do have the money to pay for Camila, and \"family helps family\", which I agree with, but I believe that help must be reciprocal and right now Camila is not reciprocating that help. My brother and dad just want to settle this down, they are not taking sides.", "created_utc": 1681108067, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12h9kla/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_sisters_vacation/", "score": 2923, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not free labor, it's *prepaid* labor and at a great pay rate even. She is free to turn down the offer if she doesn't feel able to take on a job in addition to school. That's understandable.

Her labor is far from \"unpaid\". Looking at your arrangement, you are asking for approximate 35 hours of labor in return for a $2000 trip. That is close to $60 an hour. That would be an amazing offer for a 22 year old in the US, and I am guessing from the \"my currency\" answer that you live in a lower cost of living country than the US, where the offer is even more generous. \n\nYou are NTA at all.

You are asking her to basically babysit for less than 40 hours over 2 mths, and would be paying approx 2000USD for her to go on vacation, that's more than $50 per hr.

Ypu said yourself that yes, you could pay, but it would put financial stress on you... so you came up with a completely fair solution.

I'll do that amount of babysitting for a fully funded vacation.", "NTA, but, like others, I'm wondering why you have to go on such an expensive vacation.", "NTA maybe ESH for the family. The family arranged this vacation knowing camilla is still studying and unemployed so likely will need someone to pay for her to go or she can\u2019t go. Was that thought about when it was planned? Does that make her feel bad to start with? She has asked you to pay you are already spending enough and are entitled to say no as it would put pressure on you financially. But you came up with a solution so you could pay for her and she can work it off so she can go and your finance are ok cos you will save them money. It\u2019s a nice solution except for the normal babysitter losing money for 2 months. I would want to know if camilla is spoilt and use to getting her way, or she\u2019s been put in a situation by bad family planning where she wants to go be with you but also has to study for her last semester and the babysitting feels like too much on top so is asking for help.", "NTA. She thinks family helps family only when it benefits her. At this point, if she changes her mind, the offer shouldn't stand because you can't trust she'd hold to her end of the agreement.", "NTA that's a good offer, I'd take it.", "NAH. Contrary to what others say, babysitting is not a job like others. It doesn't matter how well it pays because it's not for everyone. And you claiming that your kids are well behaved and don't need supervision is ridiculous. If that were the case you wouldn't need a babysitter. Maybe Camila doesn't like children at all. Maybe she really doesn't have time. If she could spend time on a job, maybe she would.\n\nSo while your offer might seem generous to you, it might be something that is impossible for her (be it because she hasn't time or really doesn't want to babysit). You aren't an asshole for proposing this, as it seems fair. But neither is Camila for refusing. Maybe you could discuss other methods of her paying you back in the future.", "ESH. Let's be honest. She doesn't have time for a job right now (as you yourself said). And what are the chances that this 4hours a week won't slide into more and you'll expect her to step up every time you ask (\"advance notice\" doesn't mean you're giving her the power to say \"no\"). \n\nBut you also don't have to pay for her vacation.", "INFO: How much do you pay your current babysitter?", "NAH She asked a favor, you asked a favor in return, she turned that favor down so you turned her favor down. No assholes in the vicinity here, you're both entitled to ask, and you're both entitled to turn one another down. She's not an AH for having feelings about it either, as long as she's not lying to people about it or badmouthing you. She can't control the fact that your mother is mad at you now either, your mother is also entitled to have feelings.

The holiday of a lifetime for your parents.\n\nCamilla lives with your parents, but if she doesn't agree to babysit for you, she'll have to stay home while both of your parents, you and your husband and kids, and your other brother and his wife jet off to a 5 star overseas resort.\n\nYTA. If this was just a vacation that you and husband were taking with the kids as a family unit, and Camilla wanted to shoehorn her way in, requiring her to \"work\" for payment of her share of the holiday would be fair enough. It's a generous holiday.\n\nBut your whole family unit is planning this, and because she's focusing on her schooling and not trying to split her attention between school and work, as seems to be the agreement in your family, her choices are stay home alone while everyone goes on this fancy vacation or give in to your demands on her time to \"pay it off\".", "Yeah. Like on the face of it, it's a sweet deal to get a $2k fully paid holiday in exchange for doing a bit of babysitting...\n\nBut then it looks like the whole rest of the family is going. Other brother, sister in law, both parents, OP, his husband and his kids.\n\nSo there's this sweet family vacation that's happening, Camilla is not working right now because she's focusing on uni, which OP hasn't got a problem with because both brothers did at the same age... but it's being dangled over her head that she can't go unless she agrees to babysit for OP and husband. \n\nAnd it's not like Camilla lives on her own in another city and is fully supporting herself. She's living with mum and dad, who will be gone on the vacation.\n\nI think everyone's being a bit shitty to each other here.\n\nAlso, I can see another post where OP says Dad's health hasn't been good in recent years, and mom and brother wanted to stay in a 5 star resort. \n\nSo this whole vacation was set up in a way that Camilla has no choice but to agree to OP demanding she provide babysitting, or she doesn't get to go on this once-in-a-lifetime vacation, possibly the last one their dad will ever get to go on.", "Oh I misread that part about the babysitting, my bad.  Yes, I saw another comment about the hours and pay the current babysitter gets, I get the distinct impression the hours that Camila would be expected to work would be much longer than what OP says here....\n\nOn the face of it OP seems NTA, but deep down I don't like this at all...", "A family vacation  that was planned out of her price range.

It's her parents and brother, so why did OP have to foot the bill? \n\nI guess the parents and brother could do the babysitting instead of Camilla, since they are the ones who decided on the expensive vacation.", "Lol nope", "These are some really good points and this should be higher up for sure.", "\"Dangled over her head\" is a very funny way to twist it. You're just expecting OP to spend 2.000$ that will put a strain on their finances just because, with no reciprocation from Camilla. She doesn't owe him babysitting, but neither do they owe her. If it's that important of a vacation, then the whole family should get together and fund her part.", "If OP pays their normal babysitter, it seems like that free 2K probably won't exist, as it's coming from what they would pay the babysitter. The kids will still need supervision, so they can't just write those costs off.\n\n\n\nI think OP and Camilla's family should pool together to pay for the trip. The family singling out one member that looks financially stable leaves a bad taste in my mouth, especially since Camilla isn't OP'S child. OP has their own children to worry about funding.\n\n\n\nOP'S children should come before someone else's vacation, every time. If an extra 2k would make them struggle, then I think it would be very unfair to ask that cost of OP. Their children are still young and in the house.

Because that's life.\n\n\nYou're not owed parents paying for you to go away with them forever - at some point you become an adult and have to make tough choices about what you can and cannot afford. \n\n\nAnd the rest of your family shouldn't have to compromise on their standard of holiday to accommodate the non working or low income individual. \n\n\nIF they can easily pay for you that's great - but honestly paying for the same family member over and over gets old so I wouldn't expect that to last much beyond once or twice during that period of studying /getting your first job etc\n\n\nBut if they can only afford for themselves - then That's that, your parents don't owe you luxuries into adulthood and your siblings definitely don't owe you anything like that. \n\n\nShe's the youngest (I'm guessing based on the fact all the other siblings are mentioned as having been thru uni) so unfortunately it's her turn to face that cut off of parents being able or willing to pay for you as if you are a child. \n\n\nIt's not stated here but I'd imagine (based on my family dynamic and my friends) as each of the older siblings got to that age there were things they were not included in, that Camilla was despite not being to afford it because she was younger and still 'a child' and I bet Camilla thought nothing of this and figured it was perfectly fair - now it's her turn and she's getting upset. \n\n\nThis is part of growing up, and on the face of it it looks unfair , like she's being singled out and excluded, but she's forgetting about the age and life difference between her and all her siblings - they appear to have married, got jobs, had kids etc they've done the \"we've got no money and can't afford anything\" that Camilla is going through now and have come out the otherside and her turn will come for that to. \n\n\nIt IS fair it's just not happened at the same time for all of them. \n\n\nI would imagine she's looked at OP and figured they're working, have a nice house, couple kids, babysitter, can afford a holiday and thinks covering her costs is easy for them and the response of \"sure but you owe me\" is 'petty' because she's not realising that actually it's not something OP can \"just afford\". \n\n\nThe alternative would be for Camilla to just owe her sister \u00a32k. But without a job and her not planning on getting one - how is she going to pay it back? \n\n\nAlso she didn't actually offer to pay her sister back this money - she literally just called and was like \"can you pay for me?\" \n\n\nShe proposed NOTHING in exchange. No \"I'll pay you back\" no \"I'll do this other thing for you\"\n\n\nJust \"cover me because you have money and I don't\"\n\n\nOP is actually being pretty decent. \nShe could have just said \"sorry we can't afford to\" and I doubt anyone would have given it a second thought. \n\n\nInstead her and her partner have agreed it's a bit mean for Camilla to be left behind and she's recognised her sister has no income and can't afford to actually pay her back, she's recognised she has no job and doesn't want to force her to get one because she studying therefore wouldn't ever really be able to pay her back and she also doesn't want this \"debt\" looming over their relationship.\n\n\nSo she's proposed something Camilla CAN do with very little impact on her life - 2 hours, 2 times a week for 2 months babysitting. \n\n\n(Something tbh most family would do without being paid for but that's separate)\n\n\nAnd Camilla's response was to throw her toys out the pram and go complaining to mum and dad about how unfair it was.\n\n\nShe didn't want a fair exchange, she wanted a free ride. \n\n\nIt's says a hell of a lot about Camilla's maturity. \n\n\nI wouldn't pay for her either - being left behind will be a good lesson for her on the realities of being an adult. \n\n\n(NTA)", "See OP's other comments.

To OP, the parents and older brother.\n\nLet\u2019s first summarise what I gathered from OP\u2019s post and comments. So Camila is in her last semester of Mechatronic Engineering, busy with classes and finals. She is living with the parents and is not expected to work. The father is sick and the mother, getting older. Their dream is too go to a fancy 5 stars resort abroad.\n\nFirst, to all of those shaming Camila when was the last time you were in Uni? One of my friend is doing Electrical Engineering, he is busy BUSY. From what O know engineering students have a lot of work (and sometimes real unpaid work in a lab). Even worse during finals. I used to go to the Science library during the exam period and some students would pull all-nighters several nights in a row. Try to imagine how busy Camila can be. And there\u2019s a big difference between working in her own home and having to be semi-concentrated because of kids.\n\nSecond, I don\u2019t think Camila expressed herself properly when she said she would be doing unpaid work. And to those saying NTA and bringing up how well it\u2019s \u201cpaid\u201d. Why would she need to do baby sitting for a family vacation that she had no say in organising? She\u2019s not being capricious. Her father is sick, it could be their last vacations yet her family chose a hotel that she clearly can\u2019t afford. And her brother uses it against her. Imagine \u201cyou cannot go to the last vacation with our father because you refuse to baby sit my kids\u201d. What a nice family.\n\nFinally, the parents should pay. The mother (and older brother) wants to go to this 5 star hotel but doesn\u2019t want to pay for her youngest daughter? WTF? OP should not be forced to pay for Camila.

The studies are very demanding with a lot (and I mean A LOT!) of math, physics (both mechanics and electricity) and informatics and interaction of all of them.

I don\u2019t blame the sister for wanting to go on such a trip even if she currently can\u2019t afford it - the only asshole to me are the mother and brother who have yoked up the price by demanding five stars despite knowing that the sister can\u2019t afford it and that Op is the only person in the family that can afford to pay for the sister.\n\nThat\u2019s the real issue here, not the breakdown of money per hours of babysitting or whatever. \u201cThe last holiday with dad while he\u2019s alive\u201d isn\u2019t something you\u2019d want to miss, even if you don\u2019t necessarily want to have more work to do during your final thesis term.", "The 2k is the cost of the resort.

But then I tried to figure out why they might be up in arms.\n\nSo I guess other people aren't getting up in arms about it or reading into it, so they just think it's a funny comment.\n\nHonestly when they go on about a sex act used to solve a problem between siblings, that's when I was like \"ah, they're missing the point, possibly on purpose.\"\n\nFrom what was said, you had a wank, then came to AITA after the wank. The sexual act was unrelated to the siblings, and instead the clearer headspace is what offered the solution.\n\nSo them getting offended that a sexual act happened in the vicinity of you reading a post that just happened to be about siblings is quite absurd. Like, bro, buddy, pog champ, sex is fucking everywhere. Do they also get offended when a sex joke happens on TV, and then it cuts to a commercial for Disney land or a children's toy for the ad break?\n\nI wouldn't stress about it.", "why do you even want to be a creepy guy who shares his masturbation stories? that\u2019s gross"]}
