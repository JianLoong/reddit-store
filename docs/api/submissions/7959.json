{"id": 7959, "submission_id": "10i70at", "title": "AITA for refusing to give my inheritance to my aunt?", "selftext": "For context, I (24f) have been the only child of my parents my mom has 8sibling ,4 sister which are older than her. My aunt (53f) doesn\u2019t have kids but adopted my older cousin (30m). My grandma died couple of last week and she has this 4 beautiful diamond rings I\u2019m not talking about one ring with a couple of carat but a big ring with a bunch of perfectly cut diamonds surrounding the it.\n\nThe required documents was handled by my mom since my aunt says she doesn\u2019t want any part of the husle. \n\nLast month,my cousin got engaged but not official since there\u2019s no ring yet he and his girlfriend just want to call each other fianc\u00e9.My aunt remembers my late grandma\u2019s ring that she always wear and she ask my mom if she could find it for her as she\u2019s the one who took care of eveything so my cousin wont spend thousands of dollars for their engagement ring as diamond rings are really expensive this days. \n\nLast week my mom invited the family for a family dinner and also to read out the will of my late grandma,she also contacted a lawyer just incase someone disagrees. As my mom was finishing up with the land every siblings has a equal part she moved on with the belongings and jewelries. \n\nAs she got the expensive belongings my grandma left she pulled out a box containing all of my grandma\u2019s jewelry and inside was the 4 beautiful rings and bunch of gold earings and bracelets. My aunt\u2019s eyes lit as they stare at the box hoping they could get something from it. She looked thru the envelope and begun to read it. The papers stated that my grandma left everything in the box to me including the rings that my aunt eagerly wanted to have. They have been shooting me daggers and demanding my mom to call a lawyer as there\u2019s have been my mistake.\n\nMy aunt texted me the other day demanding I should give one ring to my cousing since I still have 3 left and bunch of other stuff and I refuse saying this is my grandma\u2019s and always will and even though she\u2019s not with us anymore I can\u2019t bring myself to just give it away specially to someone who\u2019s not even my grandmas blood related.She have been calling me greedy and telling me I don\u2019t have the right as she\u2019s the daughther and I\u2019m just her grandkid. \n\nSo reddit AITA?\n\n\nEdit: \n\nThank you all for your kind response and concerns.I\u2019ve been reading comments regarding where I keep the box now that I have it.\n\nI\u2019m now living alone and yes I put it somewhere secure  that might be unusual or impossible to hide things I won\u2019t tell you where since someone involve might recognize this post. \n\nEdit 2:\n\nMy apologies that some are offended when I said \u201cblood-related\u201d to my cousin.\n\nEdit 3: \n\nI sincerely apologize for people who got offended and it\u2019s my fault I didn\u2019t specified. The blood-related that I was talking about is referring to my cousin\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. I might add that she\u2019s also looking forward on getting one of the rings and mad when she didn\u2019t get any.My granma is a huge generation-heirloom type of a woman and only the woman in the family gets the jewelries as she did with my great grandmother and her mother as well meaning they always have the rings throughout the generations. \n\nThe tradition is to wear the jewelries on the box for the weddings. My aunt found this out and she keeps insisting to give them the box as it\u2019s their right since they\u2019re the one who\u2019s getting married first. I still refused. \n\nEdit 4: \n\nJust want to let people know there\u2019s a legal appraiser document for the jewelries but since they\u2019re in my grandma\u2019s name I\u2019ll have to get it transferred. \n\nAnd yes,my mom have an access to the house I live in it\u2019s a password operated door she know the password but doesn\u2019t have any spare keys. \n\nLast Edit:\n\nSince someone might be curious my grandma only lent my mom an small earring for her wedding (not from\nheirloom)since both of her and my dad decided to be only have a civil and only 10 people invited.", "created_utc": 1674349525, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10i70at/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_inheritance_to_my/", "score": 305, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
