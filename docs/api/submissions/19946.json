She physically and emotionally is suffering right now. I am not one to judge the situation but she definitely needs some assistance getting out of this depressive episode (I have been there many times) I would recommend getting her a 504 plan for school so she can have the same opportunities as other students. Most importantly she should connect with some other type ones to help her talk through her issues. Please feel free to PM me i would love to chat about this and provide any resources that i can!", "When one is diagnosed t1, we go through the many stages of grief with o specific timeline. SOmetimes support groups for T1's, or therapy with a therapist who specialises in chronic illnesses are beneficial, and sometimes for the parent(s) as well. It is a lot to handle-she's manually doing the work of her pancreas 24/7 for the rest of her life.\n\n No, it's not an excuse to stop living, but the adjustment period can take time, and there will be times throughout her life when she experienced burnout. We're 3x any national average for situational depression and it can be very difficult. So best to figure out how to find the support you and the family needs at the start and work throughout this diagnosis first. \n\nSo I can't say YTA, but I would encourage getting support whether through counselling etc and reach out to your step sister who has T1 and discuss how to navigate this. Aslo, seriously visit r/diabetes_T1 as there's lots of parents of T1's there-maybe they can offer some guidance. It's not like she broke her arm and is acting this way-this is a life-changing diagnosis. Only those that have lived with T1 can really relate; I had no idea how hard it was until diagnosis, and lots of us have medical PTSD from the diagnosis too. Not trying to downplay anything, but find support. When she settles into a routine and learns how to survive this disease, things become more routine and life gets back to a new normal. just watch for signs of burnout, depression etc. Hope she has a CGM and access to a pump if she chooses, makes the 180 extra daily decisions we need to do a bit easier (yes it's been counted by a researcher). Eventually, no we can't use a chronic illness as an excuse, but give her time at the beginning to adjust.", "Yeah dude. YTA.\n\u201cHer diagnosis wasn\u2019t really dramatic\u201d \n\nfor who?? Would severe DKA be dramatic enough for you to validate her? \n\n She\u2019s 17 and her whole life is different now. She\u2019s a child. You\u2019re the parent. She\u2019s depressed because it sucks and she\u2019s struggling to adjust to her new reality. Consider the developmental stage of a 17 year old. Your sisters experience is helpful but she\u2019s had years and years to process this while your daughter is 2 months in. \n\nClearly you\u2019ve both got a lot on your plate. It\u2019s fucking ridiculous we live in a country where you had to pick up a second job to pay for a drug keeping her alive and it sucks that she\u2019s now dependent on machines and needles to manage her autoimmune disease, her body unfairly attacking itself. Still, I don\u2019t think starting with \u201cI\u2019m going to rehome your pets bc your mental health blows and you\u2019re not caring for them adequately \u201d was the move either.", "NAH\n\nYour daughter is in fact going through a lot, and it does sound like your empathy is running short. Maybe good reasons for that but she needs more support than she\u2019s getting and, while your relative\u2019s diagnosis makes it more blas\u00e9 for you, it\u2019s still a lot for her to work through. Support groups, therapy, etc should absolutely be high priority.\n\nYou are however NTA on the animal front - it sounds like you are at the end of your limit of what you can do with your time and money as you are carrying the entire family, your other kids are too little to do some of the work, and your animals do not deserve to suffer because of what your daughter is going through - and where the welfare of other, dependent creatures come to play, personally I am of the opinion that you either need to be able to put those other creatures first, or find them a home that can care for them properly. You are not the asshole for putting that choice to your daughter, and she is - understandable for a teenager, but still - too caught up in her own issues to have any thought about what the extra shifts mean for you or to even give a shit about the pets, and that makes her TA. She doesn\u2019t have to relearn how to walk, she hasn\u2019t had cancer or a stroke or something immediately debilitating, and to make the pets suffer is not ok. \n\nThe solution probably is to rehome the pets if you all don\u2019t have the capacity, that sounds like the kindest option for the animals which gives you and her more breathing room.", "Well the way you expressed it to your daughter that she needs to step it up definitely does make you an a-hole. No need to tell her to \u201cget her shit together.\u201d As you yourself stated, you hit a breaking-point. So I\u2019d assume you were angry and weren\u2019t actually thinking clearly.\n\nWhich isn\u2019t an excuse, you still said what you said. And I\u2019m sure you could have had an actual heartfelt conversation saying that you sympathize with her but she still has to be a productive human being. She\u2019s a big girl.\n\nAs for your point, you aren\u2019t wrong and wouldn\u2019t be an a-hole if you had expressed your feelings in a kindlier manner. But people make mistakes and fight, so give it a day or two and try to have an actual conversation without screaming and yelling like two mindful individuals.\n\nCheers.", "INFO - Have the things she likes to do declined after her diagnosis as much as her chores have?\n\nIt sounds like both of you talking with your SIL would benefit both of you.", "NAH. You both have a lot on your plate but that doesn\u2019t make it okay for your pets to be neglected. I think you framed the ultimatum poorly but as a mom exhausted working just one job I\u2019m not gonna judge you too harshly. I\u2019d recommend attempting to have the talk again and try to gently explain that if she can\u2019t handle helping with the pets anymore then they will need to go. Working two jobs as a single mom leaves you with limited time in the day. If she\u2019s falling behind on helping with chores, she\u2019s definitely not ready to work a part time job. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re super woman and capable of doing it all. You still have to set limits and try to care for yourself too. You both allowing all the responsibility to care for your numerous pets on the two very young siblings would be an ah move. If she insists she can\u2019t and you know you can\u2019t- the best and kindest option is seeking loving homes for the pets to go to instead.", "Yes YTA\n\nNot dramatic?? It\u2019s life threatening without on going treatment for the rest of her life. It\u2019s a high maintenance condition; if she slips up, she ends up in the emergency room. She needs time to grieve this diagnosis.\n\nDiabetes is characterized by high blood sugar, this makes your blood thicker and thus more likely to have cardiovascular issues over time like atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in the arteries) increasing risks for strokes and heart attacks later in life, issues with neuropathy, eye problems, feet problems, and many comorbidities. It affects the entire body, it affects her life expectancy!! The sugar in the blood not only makes it thicker, but the sugar particles are quite sharp and so they cause injury to the inner lining of the blood vessels causing them to get sticky and clump together and this is how atherosclerosis develops over time. \n\nWith type 1, the body cannot produce it\u2019s own insulin (insulin is what allows sugar into the cells for metabolism so this is why diabetics have high blood sugar) so she will forever need to take exogenous insulin forever to live and will need to make choices on her favourite way to inject needles into herself daily to get it. She will need to constantly have to check her blood sugar several times throughout the day, every day. If she neglects to manage this well, her body will begin to break down fats instead of sugars and the leftovers, ketones, will accumulate and will cause a metabolic imbalance that will create a medical emergency that is life threatening called diabetic ketoacidosis. \n\nDo you know all this? It\u2019s VERY dramatic. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s working through processing all of this information right now and as her parent, you owe her some compassion and understanding of this condition. \n\nI understand your concern for the animals and chores, but don\u2019t you think that is secondary to what\u2019s going on right now? You need to find another way to deal with this stress. And you 100% need to educate yourself more about this disease.", "YTA.  Your daughter has been diagnosed with a major, incurable medical condition that has a big impact on her life.  She\u2019s struggling with it so much that she\u2019s now failing all her classes, and you think the answer is to threaten and punish her because you somehow think her diagnosis isn\u2019t a big deal? \n\nYou are failing her as a parent right now.", "INFO: Her diagnosis wasn't dramatic to you or her? Is she actually really handling everything herself medically after such a huge diagnosis?", "if the animals are being neglected and they need to be rehomed then so be it", "YTA. I get you're upset and yes she has obligations but you're going at this the wrong way. You're expecting her to handle this as an adult who's used to the disease from forever when SHE JUST FOUND THIS OUT. She also still A CHILD. She's a mess of hormones because that's teenage years and just learned she has a condition that altered her life drastically. Yes she can't neglect her responsibilities but there are ways, this disease is emotional too and her emotional condition is going to directly impact her physical condition. She needs therapy and time to adjust and yes you can tell her you need her to tend to her animals, in a firm way without threats, have you even talked to her? You're making it sound like yeah this is her reality now but I've seen it, I've lived with someone who had it, she can manage, she needs to up and hustle NOW. There are ways that don't involve threats and you disregarding how life altering this is for her.", "YTA. Your daughter is adjusting to a serious lifelong condition, which is a big emotional burden.

However, it's important to approach the issue with empathy and understanding. Let's break down the situation and address your concerns.Firstly, it's crucial to acknowledge that a Type 1 diabetes diagnosis can be life-altering and emotionally challenging for a teenager. Adjusting to the necessary lifestyle changes, including managing blood sugar levels and taking insulin, can be overwhelming. It's possible that your daughter is still trying to come to terms with her diagnosis and may need some time to adjust.  \n\n\nIn future it might be helpful to approach this issue in a more supportive and compassionate manner. Instead of threatening to rehome the animals, consider having a calm and open conversation with your daughter. Express your concerns about her neglecting her responsibilities and the impact it's having on the family and her siblings. Try to listen to her perspective and understand the challenges she's facing. Encourage her to share her feelings, frustrations, and difficulties so you can better support her.", "YTA - imagine being 17, being diagnosed with a lifelong illness that can have all sorts of fun things happen, and requires frequent injections of insulin just to stay alive and being expected to process that in just a few short weeks, at 17, while having to deal with all the other coming of age bullshit that happens in the teens. \n\nPeople process things differently and while I sympathize with you, compassion and understanding don't seem to be very evident here. \n\nIt's not like she caught Covid and will be over it soon. This is a life changing diagnosis and failing to adequately deal with it can and does result in death.", "YTA.  You're the adult. You would be rehoming the pets because you can't care for them, not the children. Instead of it building to a breaking point did you talk to her about why she's not doing anything or did you just explode at her?", "Softly, YTA\n\nLook, I fully understand you are overwhelmed and rehoming some animals to better align with what you and your daughter can handle right now might very well be the right choice. \n\nWith that said, I think you focused a lot on you and your needs without trying to sympathize and understand what your daughter is going through. She just received some huge health news, her mom has to take a second job because of her* and she has a bunch more responsibilities now. That's really hard and she still just a teenager.\n\nThis would be much better handled to approach it as a team, rather than opponents. \n\n\n\n*well, really a crappy medical system but it probably feels like her fault.", "YTA\nI totally understand where you are coming from with your frustrations but it seems to me like your daughter is depressed and is neglecting her chores and schoolwork because of depression rather than laziness. Maybe just sit her down and have a talk with her about how she has been feeling lately. I would reassure her that you do not intend on rehoming the animals and that you are just feeling very overwhelmed lately and are worried about her. The last thing an anxious/depressed person needs is to feel like they are a burden. \nIf she is more comfortable talking with someone else about her personal issues a therapist or counselor might also be a good idea. Maybe meeting with other people with similar experiences is also a good idea.", "I was feeling pretty bad about my parenting today until I read this. Holy f---, YTA! Your daughter needs therapy, a support group, someone to help her process this literally life-changing diagnosis. \n\nAlso, rehoming pets is an AH thing to do in general, but is particularly awful when your daughter likely needs some furry friends to help her cope.", "NTA Animals cannot be neglected just because you feel upset.  You are not able to because you are working longer hours. If she can\u2019t step up, then the best thing is to rehome the animals where they will get care that they need. The animals cannot wait. They need feeding and care daily.  \n\nEdited to add: the cost of insulin should come down in the next year. I think Eli Lilly prices drop on July 1. Contact the manufacturer to see if you qualify for current reduced cost programs. You may need to switch brands of insulin (I.e. Lantus to Levemir) but your doc will work with you on that. They are used to this issue.", "YTA. Holy fuck, YTA. She's a diabetic. You have no fucking idea what that entails, how bad this degenerative disease is, how it can affect every fucking thing.

If you have more pets in the house than you can handle you may need to have serious conversations about that as a family but you can't just dump all that on your daughter when she's trying to figure out how to process this diagnosis. She's going through something scary right now and you should be there to support her. Obviously you're not entirely wrong that she will have to learn to work with her diagnosis if she wants to be successful in the future- but now is not the time, she needs love and support and a little leniency from you until she feels well enough to take those next steps.

Maybe having her taking care of things like feeding and cleaning up after them however you walk and/or do the physical tasks related to them.

As someone who also has a lifetime diagnosis that will never ever get better, I cannot imagine how hard it would have been to have gotten my diagnosis in high school.

That's not responsible pet ownership. If she weren't living with other people to pick up the slack, that would be animal abuse. A pet is a responsibility that can not be neglected or given up because things get hard. She took on the responsibility, and if she can't handle that responsibility, then the moral and ethical thing to do is rehome the animals.\n\nI'm so so sorry that the garbage healthcare in this country (because only America treats sick people like cash cows)  has forced you to take a second job to pay for her insulin.

Your words to your daughter were harsh, but it sounds like you're all struggling right now. If there are other forms of community support that might be available to help your family adjust to its \"new normal\", it would be worth looking into them. (More work for you, I know!) For instance, there may be community organisations who could sponsor an insulin pump for your daughter, or volunteers who could help to take care of the animals while you're all adjusting. Your daughter might have access to counselling through her school or through a hospital social worker; it sounds like she is having a harder time with the emotional adjustment to her condition than to the medication regime as such. If her school is any good they should also be making some effort to help her get her grades back on track rather than putting all the work on her. Please try to be generous with her and also with yourself - it's a big change, and it's been less than two months since the diagnosis, after all.

This is most relevant in the first few months after diagnosis when the patient and care team are establishing which type of insulin works best, how to change diet, how to manage basal/bolus insulin, etc. It takes a **minimum** of about three months to get into a settled routine with this, your daughter has barely had her diagnosis six weeks. Her body has to adjust physically to the insulin doses and wearing a Dexcom, and mentally to the magnitude of the diagnosis. If her blood glucose is frequently low this could affect her focus as well.\n\nThis is a big enough deal that it is understandable that she's struggling in school and with her household responsibilities.

Do you have a family member who can watch the pets temporarily so you don't have to permanently give them away?", "You're clearly burnt out, she's clearly going through a lot as far as processing, it's going to take time to find balance. Even though her diagnosis feels like the worst thing to happen to her ever, she'll adjust eventually. If animals need to be rehomed as a result of her not helping her siblings to care for them, unfortunately that's just something that has to happen because time doesn't stop for pets, they need care every day.

Also, it would make things a bit cheaper around the house in regards to feeding them and inevitable vet visits down the road", "Ideally, yes, but OP is a single parent who doesn't seem to get any meaningful financial or emotional support from the kids' dad/s, and she's working two jobs to keep the lights on, the humans and animals fed, and to provide necessary medical care for all of them. Meanwhile, the cost of living is skyrocketing and everyone is under a lot of stress. She's probably incredibly burned out, and while that doesn't excuse her being dismissive of her daughter's feelings, it does explain why she doesn't necessarily have the extra bandwidth to be as sensitive in her approach as might be ideal.", "In my response to the post itself, I did criticize this. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to completely blame the parent. The \u201ckid\u201d is 17. So she\u2019s a young adult, not anything like an infant child.", ">Right, but as the parent, they should have the emotional and mental maturity to put their kid ahead of themselves.\n\nWhich is why they've taken an extra job to pay for her medicine. \n\n>This sounds a lot like blaming the kid for their condition.\n\nNo more like saying that she can't just shut down. Let's be honest t1 is treatable and has a decent life expectancy. She's also 17 so she's definitely gonna need to handle her personal responsibilities, especially if she wants to live on her own. \n\nHonestly I feel bad for the mother. She's getting dragged despite literally having everything on her shoulders. She should just re-home the pets considering they're a luxury that drain resources and the kids are not gonna realistically take care of.", "It's less than two months at this point.", "Literally got a physical, blood levels etc. just fine.", "I am referring to college.", "No one is really beating her up though, She\u2019s here asking for everyone\u2019s perspective on this. She\u2019s not a monster, she\u2019s a stressed out parent that isn\u2019t seeing things from her daughter\u2019s perspective. That\u2019s all", "I said that because type 1 is less talked about and educated on because far less people have it. People may have type 2 or know someone with type 2 and think they know it all, when they don\u2019t. Never said one was easier or harder.\n\nETA: 1 million people become type 2 diabetic per year vs 100,000 becoming type 1", "I have to agree, the animals deserve to be cared for properly. People are sick/depressed/unstable/old and can't take care of their pets, no one faults them for finding better homes for them. Mom is single, pulling two jobs plus parenting, she understands the animals are being neglected.", "I think anyone, even an older adult, could really struggle with managing a chronic disease. If not the physical symptoms, the mental ones that aren't as visable. \n\nSounds like this 17 year old is now in a depressive state and this could very likely be their first experience entering something traumatic for her. \"Will people start treating me differently? Will anyone love me knowing I'm not \"normal\" anymore? How could this have happened? Why me? *Will we be able to afford to live as a family with my medical costs making my mom work 2 jobs?* Can we even afford to send me to college?\" 2 months in and with so many questions that she hasn't even had time or experience to navigate yet.\n\nLate-aged teenagers are held to very high standards or given a lot of slack for how they handle situations. I would honestly say that NAH with it being so early. Mom definitely needs to get mental help for her kiddo, and kiddo needs to take some initiative and do some research on her chronic condition to figure out how to manage it. They'll both figure it out, but at 2 months in, its definitely an adjustment for everyone involved.", "Oh, so you *did* see a doctor about it?"]}
