She physically and emotionally is suffering right now. I am not one to judge the situation but she definitely needs some assistance getting out of this depressive episode (I have been there many times) I would recommend getting her a 504 plan for school so she can have the same opportunities as other students. Most importantly she should connect with some other type ones to help her talk through her issues. Please feel free to PM me i would love to chat about this and provide any resources that i can!", "When one is diagnosed t1, we go through the many stages of grief with o specific timeline. SOmetimes support groups for T1's, or therapy with a therapist who specialises in chronic illnesses are beneficial, and sometimes for the parent(s) as well. It is a lot to handle-she's manually doing the work of her pancreas 24/7 for the rest of her life.\n\n No, it's not an excuse to stop living, but the adjustment period can take time, and there will be times throughout her life when she experienced burnout. We're 3x any national average for situational depression and it can be very difficult. So best to figure out how to find the support you and the family needs at the start and work throughout this diagnosis first. \n\nSo I can't say YTA, but I would encourage getting support whether through counselling etc and reach out to your step sister who has T1 and discuss how to navigate this. Aslo, seriously visit r/diabetes_T1 as there's lots of parents of T1's there-maybe they can offer some guidance. It's not like she broke her arm and is acting this way-this is a life-changing diagnosis. Only those that have lived with T1 can really relate; I had no idea how hard it was until diagnosis, and lots of us have medical PTSD from the diagnosis too. Not trying to downplay anything, but find support. When she settles into a routine and learns how to survive this disease, things become more routine and life gets back to a new normal. just watch for signs of burnout, depression etc. Hope she has a CGM and access to a pump if she chooses, makes the 180 extra daily decisions we need to do a bit easier (yes it's been counted by a researcher). Eventually, no we can't use a chronic illness as an excuse, but give her time at the beginning to adjust.", "Yeah dude. YTA.\n\u201cHer diagnosis wasn\u2019t really dramatic\u201d \n\nfor who?? Would severe DKA be dramatic enough for you to validate her? \n\n She\u2019s 17 and her whole life is different now. She\u2019s a child. You\u2019re the parent. She\u2019s depressed because it sucks and she\u2019s struggling to adjust to her new reality. Consider the developmental stage of a 17 year old. Your sisters experience is helpful but she\u2019s had years and years to process this while your daughter is 2 months in. \n\nClearly you\u2019ve both got a lot on your plate. It\u2019s fucking ridiculous we live in a country where you had to pick up a second job to pay for a drug keeping her alive and it sucks that she\u2019s now dependent on machines and needles to manage her autoimmune disease, her body unfairly attacking itself. Still, I don\u2019t think starting with \u201cI\u2019m going to rehome your pets bc your mental health blows and you\u2019re not caring for them adequately \u201d was the move either.", "NAH\n\nYour daughter is in fact going through a lot, and it does sound like your empathy is running short. Maybe good reasons for that but she needs more support than she\u2019s getting and, while your relative\u2019s diagnosis makes it more blas\u00e9 for you, it\u2019s still a lot for her to work through. Support groups, therapy, etc should absolutely be high priority.\n\nYou are however NTA on the animal front - it sounds like you are at the end of your limit of what you can do with your time and money as you are carrying the entire family, your other kids are too little to do some of the work, and your animals do not deserve to suffer because of what your daughter is going through - and where the welfare of other, dependent creatures come to play, personally I am of the opinion that you either need to be able to put those other creatures first, or find them a home that can care for them properly. You are not the asshole for putting that choice to your daughter, and she is - understandable for a teenager, but still - too caught up in her own issues to have any thought about what the extra shifts mean for you or to even give a shit about the pets, and that makes her TA. She doesn\u2019t have to relearn how to walk, she hasn\u2019t had cancer or a stroke or something immediately debilitating, and to make the pets suffer is not ok. \n\nThe solution probably is to rehome the pets if you all don\u2019t have the capacity, that sounds like the kindest option for the animals which gives you and her more breathing room.", "Well the way you expressed it to your daughter that she needs to step it up definitely does make you an a-hole. No need to tell her to \u201cget her shit together.\u201d As you yourself stated, you hit a breaking-point. So I\u2019d assume you were angry and weren\u2019t actually thinking clearly.\n\nWhich isn\u2019t an excuse, you still said what you said. And I\u2019m sure you could have had an actual heartfelt conversation saying that you sympathize with her but she still has to be a productive human being. She\u2019s a big girl.\n\nAs for your point, you aren\u2019t wrong and wouldn\u2019t be an a-hole if you had expressed your feelings in a kindlier manner. But people make mistakes and fight, so give it a day or two and try to have an actual conversation without screaming and yelling like two mindful individuals.\n\nCheers.", "INFO - Have the things she likes to do declined after her diagnosis as much as her chores have?\n\nIt sounds like both of you talking with your SIL would benefit both of you.", "NAH. You both have a lot on your plate but that doesn\u2019t make it okay for your pets to be neglected. I think you framed the ultimatum poorly but as a mom exhausted working just one job I\u2019m not gonna judge you too harshly. I\u2019d recommend attempting to have the talk again and try to gently explain that if she can\u2019t handle helping with the pets anymore then they will need to go. Working two jobs as a single mom leaves you with limited time in the day. If she\u2019s falling behind on helping with chores, she\u2019s definitely not ready to work a part time job. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re super woman and capable of doing it all. You still have to set limits and try to care for yourself too. You both allowing all the responsibility to care for your numerous pets on the two very young siblings would be an ah move. If she insists she can\u2019t and you know you can\u2019t- the best and kindest option is seeking loving homes for the pets to go to instead.", "Yes YTA\n\nNot dramatic?? It\u2019s life threatening without on going treatment for the rest of her life. It\u2019s a high maintenance condition; if she slips up, she ends up in the emergency room. She needs time to grieve this diagnosis.\n\nDiabetes is characterized by high blood sugar, this makes your blood thicker and thus more likely to have cardiovascular issues over time like atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in the arteries) increasing risks for strokes and heart attacks later in life, issues with neuropathy, eye problems, feet problems, and many comorbidities. It affects the entire body, it affects her life expectancy!! The sugar in the blood not only makes it thicker, but the sugar particles are quite sharp and so they cause injury to the inner lining of the blood vessels causing them to get sticky and clump together and this is how atherosclerosis develops over time. \n\nWith type 1, the body cannot produce it\u2019s own insulin (insulin is what allows sugar into the cells for metabolism so this is why diabetics have high blood sugar) so she will forever need to take exogenous insulin forever to live and will need to make choices on her favourite way to inject needles into herself daily to get it. She will need to constantly have to check her blood sugar several times throughout the day, every day. If she neglects to manage this well, her body will begin to break down fats instead of sugars and the leftovers, ketones, will accumulate and will cause a metabolic imbalance that will create a medical emergency that is life threatening called diabetic ketoacidosis. \n\nDo you know all this? It\u2019s VERY dramatic. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s working through processing all of this information right now and as her parent, you owe her some compassion and understanding of this condition. \n\nI understand your concern for the animals and chores, but don\u2019t you think that is secondary to what\u2019s going on right now? You need to find another way to deal with this stress. And you 100% need to educate yourself more about this disease.", "YTA.  Your daughter has been diagnosed with a major, incurable medical condition that has a big impact on her life.  She\u2019s struggling with it so much that she\u2019s now failing all her classes, and you think the answer is to threaten and punish her because you somehow think her diagnosis isn\u2019t a big deal? \n\nYou are failing her as a parent right now.", "INFO: Her diagnosis wasn't dramatic to you or her? Is she actually really handling everything herself medically after such a huge diagnosis?", "if the animals are being neglected and they need to be rehomed then so be it", "YTA. I get you're upset and yes she has obligations but you're going at this the wrong way. You're expecting her to handle this as an adult who's used to the disease from forever when SHE JUST FOUND THIS OUT. She also still A CHILD. She's a mess of hormones because that's teenage years and just learned she has a condition that altered her life drastically. Yes she can't neglect her responsibilities but there are ways, this disease is emotional too and her emotional condition is going to directly impact her physical condition. She needs therapy and time to adjust and yes you can tell her you need her to tend to her animals, in a firm way without threats, have you even talked to her? You're making it sound like yeah this is her reality now but I've seen it, I've lived with someone who had it, she can manage, she needs to up and hustle NOW. There are ways that don't involve threats and you disregarding how life altering this is for her.", "YTA. Your daughter is adjusting to a serious lifelong condition, which is a big emotional burden.

However, it's important to approach the issue with empathy and understanding. Let's break down the situation and address your concerns.Firstly, it's crucial to acknowledge that a Type 1 diabetes diagnosis can be life-altering and emotionally challenging for a teenager. Adjusting to the necessary lifestyle changes, including managing blood sugar levels and taking insulin, can be overwhelming. It's possible that your daughter is still trying to come to terms with her diagnosis and may need some time to adjust.  \n\n\nIn future it might be helpful to approach this issue in a more supportive and compassionate manner. Instead of threatening to rehome the animals, consider having a calm and open conversation with your daughter. Express your concerns about her neglecting her responsibilities and the impact it's having on the family and her siblings. Try to listen to her perspective and understand the challenges she's facing. Encourage her to share her feelings, frustrations, and difficulties so you can better support her.", "YTA - imagine being 17, being diagnosed with a lifelong illness that can have all sorts of fun things happen, and requires frequent injections of insulin just to stay alive and being expected to process that in just a few short weeks, at 17, while having to deal with all the other coming of age bullshit that happens in the teens. \n\nPeople process things differently and while I sympathize with you, compassion and understanding don't seem to be very evident here. \n\nIt's not like she caught Covid and will be over it soon. This is a life changing diagnosis and failing to adequately deal with it can and does result in death.", "YTA.  You're the adult. You would be rehoming the pets because you can't care for them, not the children. Instead of it building to a breaking point did you talk to her about why she's not doing anything or did you just explode at her?", "Softly, YTA\n\nLook, I fully understand you are overwhelmed and rehoming some animals to better align with what you and your daughter can handle right now might very well be the right choice. \n\nWith that said, I think you focused a lot on you and your needs without trying to sympathize and understand what your daughter is going through. She just received some huge health news, her mom has to take a second job because of her* and she has a bunch more responsibilities now. That's really hard and she still just a teenager.\n\nThis would be much better handled to approach it as a team, rather than opponents. \n\n\n\n*well, really a crappy medical system but it probably feels like her fault.", "YTA\nI totally understand where you are coming from with your frustrations but it seems to me like your daughter is depressed and is neglecting her chores and schoolwork because of depression rather than laziness. Maybe just sit her down and have a talk with her about how she has been feeling lately. I would reassure her that you do not intend on rehoming the animals and that you are just feeling very overwhelmed lately and are worried about her. The last thing an anxious/depressed person needs is to feel like they are a burden. \nIf she is more comfortable talking with someone else about her personal issues a therapist or counselor might also be a good idea. Maybe meeting with other people with similar experiences is also a good idea.", "I was feeling pretty bad about my parenting today until I read this. Holy f---, YTA! Your daughter needs therapy, a support group, someone to help her process this literally life-changing diagnosis. \n\nAlso, rehoming pets is an AH thing to do in general, but is particularly awful when your daughter likely needs some furry friends to help her cope.", "NTA Animals cannot be neglected just because you feel upset.  You are not able to because you are working longer hours. If she can\u2019t step up, then the best thing is to rehome the animals where they will get care that they need. The animals cannot wait. They need feeding and care daily.  \n\nEdited to add: the cost of insulin should come down in the next year. I think Eli Lilly prices drop on July 1. Contact the manufacturer to see if you qualify for current reduced cost programs. You may need to switch brands of insulin (I.e. Lantus to Levemir) but your doc will work with you on that. They are used to this issue.", "YTA. Holy fuck, YTA. She's a diabetic. You have no fucking idea what that entails, how bad this degenerative disease is, how it can affect every fucking thing.

If you have more pets in the house than you can handle you may need to have serious conversations about that as a family but you can't just dump all that on your daughter when she's trying to figure out how to process this diagnosis. She's going through something scary right now and you should be there to support her. Obviously you're not entirely wrong that she will have to learn to work with her diagnosis if she wants to be successful in the future- but now is not the time, she needs love and support and a little leniency from you until she feels well enough to take those next steps.

Maybe having her taking care of things like feeding and cleaning up after them however you walk and/or do the physical tasks related to them.

As someone who also has a lifetime diagnosis that will never ever get better, I cannot imagine how hard it would have been to have gotten my diagnosis in high school.

That's not responsible pet ownership. If she weren't living with other people to pick up the slack, that would be animal abuse. A pet is a responsibility that can not be neglected or given up because things get hard. She took on the responsibility, and if she can't handle that responsibility, then the moral and ethical thing to do is rehome the animals.\n\nI'm so so sorry that the garbage healthcare in this country (because only America treats sick people like cash cows)  has forced you to take a second job to pay for her insulin.

You are not the one who has it. I definitely understand managing a child who has different needs than others. This is your job as her mother. Talk to her to find out exactly what's bothering her. Find solutions together or positive affirmations she can practice. Her whole world has been turned upside-down. Is TD1 manageable? Sure. But it can still be dangerous and scary, especially for a child. Please be more understanding and compassionate.", "I'm sorry to add on, but yes, YTA. Your daughter is most likely still struggling. It's hard being diabetic and being newly diagnosed is scary. You may be 'well controlled', but the worry is always in the back of your mind. Did I calculate everything right? Did I eat enough? Did I take too much insulin?? \n\nAnd for a teenager who knows her mum had to get a second job to afford the meds?? Yep, even more worry. Mum's tired, and it's my fault. Mum's grumpy and frustrated, and it's my fault. Everything is my fault. She's probably depressed and trying not to let it show.", "Everyone I see is saying Y T A, but I disagree. I received my 1st medical diagnosis when I was 6 (epilepsy). Not the same but it greatly affected my life. I was never treated any different, even though I was on drugs that were super heavy and had really tough bouts of a lot of seizures. It made me stronger. \n\nSo much stronger that when I was diagnosed with 6 more autoimmune diseases and conditions from the ages of 20-30, I was able to advocate for myself, manage them, and now as a 46 year old, I am healthier than most people my age. \n\nI understand I did not have the same diagnosis - but I think the point holds. When I was diagnosed with Lupus at age 20, I had a really bad case of it. The doctors expected me to be on disability for life. Yet here I am, living a above average life with my teenage son, working, I\u2019ve owned businesses, and I\u2019m healthy. Never taken a dime from the government. \n\nIf my mom would have coddled me with the seizures I would have handled other things differently as an adult. \n\nOP I hope you see this. Please do talk with your daughter - but don\u2019t let her get out of chores because \u201creasons\u201d. Don\u2019t send her off to the world where an employer isn\u2019t going to care about anything other than her getting work done.", "OP reach out for help. School, doctors, community organizations. \n\nPlease avoid making any huge changes right now. YWBTA if you give away the animals right now. Get some rest, then sit down and talk to her, see if you can put together a schedule so everyone knows the chores and expectations. \n\nMaybe the little ones can do more of the lighter around the house chores while she takes care of the animals. I didn\u2019t see what kind of animals but if they\u2019re livestock, maybe a 4-H or FFA program can lend a hand for a little while. \n\nIt takes time to absorb and adjust to the changes in your lives. \n\nIf you\u2019re in the US, look into prescription programs like GoodRX and subsidies from the manufacturers.", "OP, you had an amazing opening with a teenager and missed it.  Your daughter said,  \" You have no idea what I'm going through and how hard it is.\"\n\nThis is a moment to say, \"No, I don't know exactly how hard it is.  Tell me what you are going through.\"  It would take 1/2 hour out of your day, but it is well worth it to have your daughter open up about how all this is affecting her.\n\nNot to worry.  Another opportunity will come up.  Get to the reasons BEHIND the slack-off with the animals and at school.  You will be focusing on her feelings, not her temporary setbacks and shortcomings, because that is a different conversation.  The most important conversation right now is how she is doing with this huge change.  She needs your emotional support and helping her talk about her feelings is part of that.\n\nGood luck to you both.", "YTA -\n\nI don't think people truly understand how devastating Diabetes is. Your body is constantly trying to kill you and you are fighting against it every day to survive.\n\nIt can be debilitating, you can feel like you have no energy physically and emotionally. Highs and lows, especially in the beginning when you're trying to work out how your body reacts, can make you so ill.\n\nIt is obvious that your daughter needs support right now, life long illnesses don't just take a toll on the body, but the mind too. Everything you've said about her sounds like a person who is struggling and overwhelmed.\n\nYou say that you're a single mom working two jobs and doesn't even have enough time to feed the dogs, so do you spend much time with your daughter? Is she looking after her siblings as well as lots of animals while you're gone? There could be a lot of things going on here that you need to think about.\n\nI would look into a therapist for her if I was you and if the animal situation is too much then maybe see if friends/family can take them for a while, until things get better.\n\nShe broke down and confided about how hard things are for her and your response was to brush it off and tell her that it's not an excuse and to get her shit together. That is cruel and I imagine hurt her a lot.\n\nBeing supportive and understanding while she goes through this is crucial and how you handle this could be a game changer to how her life goes.", "It's depression, from an extremely traumatic diagnosis. This is a \"rest of your life\" kind of diagnosis, that has a lot of scary elements. Get her therapy for the depression - it's not a short term thing with this kind of trauma.", "Just going to say, I am not a doctor.\n\nWhen I was 15-19 for some reason I was always thirsty. Would drink cup after cup of water. Never went to the doctor and it resolved itself. Went recently for a required physical for work and have no issues what so ever. My aunt always said I must be diabetic because I pee and drink a lot. Well I can say with confidence, 15 years later she was wrong and I\u2019m glad my mother didn\u2019t care to bring me to a doctor because I\u2019d have been on insulin for over a decade. A new doctor is ~$250,000 in debt. They don\u2019t want to lose their job so they do what the NIH and CDC says. NIH and CDC has been wrong for the past three years on something so basic. I can only imagine what else they ignore and push. Disgusting really. Operation Paperclip, three generations advanced.", "Hm, for some perspective OP when I developed lactose intolerance it took me months of feeling sick before I clued in as to why and then another year of experimentation to figure out my barriers and do/donts. It. Sucked. I felt awful a good majority of the time.\n\nObviously diabetes is different, but I'd assume it's different in an even more life changing day-to-day way? You can't take care of the animals because you're busy. I get it, but she can't worry about taking care of the animals either because she's taking care of herself and figuring out her new barriers.\n\nI don't think rehoming them is necessarily the wrong decision but it was wrong to frame it on the context of \"you aren't doing it, so if you don't pick up the ball I'll send them away!\" YTA But you are trying and this is very hard OP. Everyone makes mistakes when they're overworked and overwhelmed.", "NTA. I'm sorry she is going thru this, but you still need to do what you gotta do.", "Probably Unpopular but NTA.\nIts diabetes. Even T1 you can lead a very comfortable life if managed properly.\nIt\u2019s not a debilitating condition.\nYes the delivery was not great, but it\u2019s also true having a diagnosis is not an excuse not to do anything around the house. \nIt might be brutal, but life does not stop just because of that. \nPlus if you can\u2019t take care of pets your neglecting them and that\u2019s not fair on them.", "I agree with this wholeheartedly, and I would simply add that OP mentioned that her \u201cdiagnosis wasn\u2019t dramatic\u201d\u2014and I wonder if that\u2019s the problem. Though I know it wasn\u2019t meant to be, that phrasing seems quite dismissive and reflects your perception that \u201cthis isn\u2019t a big deal\u201d. Her internal world is completely rocked, but because she didn\u2019t make a big stink, you didn\u2019t check in with her as she may have needed. \n\nJust because the transition has *seemed* smooth, it\u2019s clear daughter is dealing with this by internalizing. It\u2019s up to you to regularly check in and make space for her to talk with you about what\u2019s difficult for her, as this is literally life-changing, and a huge, huge adjustment and roadblock\u2014especially when you\u2019re that young. The more you tell her to pull herself up by the bootstraps, the more dismissed she\u2019ll feel\u2014and the harder everything will be for her. Regardless of her age and how close to \u201clegal adulthood\u201d she may be, OP, she is ill, and still very much a child who needs her mother.\n\nETA, despite an initial NAH, that didn\u2019t sit well with me. \n\nHate to say it, but YTA, OP.", "shes in therapy. she\u2019s also on the dexcom and has been since a week after her DX. insurance won\u2019t cover a pump unfortunately.", "I feel like this is what it boils down to. OP is tired, teenager is in shock/on auto piolet; neither has had the chance to just sit down and verbalize their feelings. Mom assumes everything is good since teen is getting her needed medication and doesn't see a reason for being too tired to do chores. Teen's mind is probably going 100 miles a minute:  \n \"How will I pay for my medication when I turn 18? How will I manage that with school? Will schools want me? Will employers want me? Can I still party with friends? Will my friends not invite me if there's booze? Am I going to need all new friends? Will I need all diabetic friends? What happens if my sugar drops while out and I pass out? Will I lose my license? Will I never drive?\"   \nThere's probably so many things they're thinking about and worried about. Insulin isn't going to fix that. Talk things out.", "I think OP approached things harshly, but it sounds like she really can\u2019t handle the pets right now. If she kept the pets and they were neglected people would call her an asshole for that too.", "Pets don't care if she is sick, they deserve to be taken care of. If for some reason they can't take care of the pets then the pets need to be rehomed. \n\nOP can you get your stepsister back again to work with your daughter on how to handle her disease? Help her adjust? Maybe get her to stop by or call once a week. Is there any type of support group in your area that your daughter can go to, it won't look so overwhelming if she sees there are others like her.", "Its not an excuse to ignore responsibilities. She may be TA for how she treated her child, but not b/c of what she is asking for. And rehoming animals that cant or arent being taken care of is the right move for the animal to ensure a better life for them. She is TA for how she handled the situation.", "I would agree that it wasn\u2019t dramatic. Most T1d\u2019s are diagnosed in the hospital after collapsing in DKA.  It is likely she was never hospitalized.", "Oh please it's not like she's in a constant state of DKA and it sounds like it's relatively well controlled she doesn't have cancer and yeah op shouldn't invalidate any diagnosis but diabetics do work every day... diabetic adults still work their jobs and manage their diabetes she's failing school and not doing chores that's the bottom line", "she still goings out with her friends. not as much as she used to because she says it\u2019s a hassle. not as much as she used to but still pretty much every weekend.", "I know what t1d is. What I meant by not dramatic is that she wasn't in DKA and didn't need to be admitted. Poor wording on my part though", "It\u2019s important to remember this is also a lot for the parent to deal with. There are multiple sides to every story, and I\u2019m sure OP is stressed as well.\n\nDoes this invalidate the daughter? Of course not. But it\u2019s not fair to put all the blame on one party. We\u2019re all human and we all make mistakes.", "I don\u2019t think potentially rehoming the pets is punishment as much as a desperate decision to prevent the animals from being neglected.", "As mentioned to another, most T1Ds are diagnosed in the hospital after collapsing from DKA. That\u2019s pretty dramatic.  Sounds to me that she was not hospitalized. So not dramatic.", "This. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a terrible person, OP. I think both you and your daughter are just having a hard time adjusting to the new norm that this diagnosis has brought to your family. I think you both can benefit from some counseling, support group, or, if you can afford it, therapy. You are not the only family to go through this.\n\nDon\u2019t drive your daughter away with threats. Talk to her instead. Try to get a sense of what she\u2019s thinking and feeling.

When I was young and had no clue how to deal with insurance companies a local advocacy group helped me get what I needed out of BCBS. A couple of phone calls could help take some of pressure off of you.", "She would be a much, much bigger asshole if she did that", "OP isn\u2019t an asshole for possibly having to rehome the pets, but she is an asshole for how she\u2019s addressing the situation and thinking of her daughter. She\u2019s very dismissive of her daughter having to process the new diagnosis of a life-long, potentially life-limiting diagnosis that requires daily management and puts her at risk of other serious diseases. It\u2019s possible to address the issue of the pets\u2019 wellbeing without blaming it on the daughter being lazy.", "Then knowing all of this, I think the important part is to allow her time to grieve on her time, not your time. This is a huge diagnosis and she has to grieve the loss of disease free life that she just lost.", "Right, but as the parent, they should have the emotional and mental maturity to put their kid ahead of themselves.\n\nThis sounds a lot like blaming the kid for their condition.", "yeah her bg was only in the low 200s so it was brought down with a single shot", "How long has this whole thing gone on? A week? A month? A year?", "Yes it is different, but it still is hard and not all can be handled by a healthy diet and meds. \n\nFYI my oldest is diabetic and it\u2019s not type 1 or 2.

His Dad\u2019s side of the family.", "I can completely understand that you cannot adequately care for the animals properly given your situation (single mother with two jobs) but I just don't think it is fair the way you approached the topic with your daughter.

From what I can tell she seems very emotional right now and the last thing she needed to hear was that she is responsible for her animals leaving.", "Who is watching the younger kids while you work? Can that person also assist with the animals until your daughter is in a better headspace?", "Yeah. I know for me, I felt very \u201coff\u201d and that was one thing that helped the doctors uncover what was happening. And then starting treatment was still another curveball.

It\u2019s in the posting.", "Yes this is what I was thinking but was having trouble conveying it", "Glad you shares that. I have seen people have a difficult hard time with their diagnosis. \nIt is hard to accept.
