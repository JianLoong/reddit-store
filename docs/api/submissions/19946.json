I am a single mom who had to get a second job to pay for her insulin (obviously i don\u2019t hold that against her, it\u2019s not her fault) but i don\u2019t have the time for the animals. Not to mention her grades are all Fs now.\n\nthe other day i hit a breaking point and basically told her that if she doesn\u2019t start helping out, I will start rehoming the animals that her siblings can\u2019t handle. She had a total breakdown telling me i have no idea what she\u2019s going through and how hard it is. I told her it\u2019s not an excuse to completely neglect everything and that she had to get her shit together or the animals will be finding new homes. she ran out the room crying and has spoken about 3 words to me since then.\n\nI understand that this disease is a lot to handle, and i\u2019m trying to be as supportive as possible, but i don\u2019t know what to do anymore.\n\nmy step sister says I need to give her time to adjust, but i don\u2019t know if i can.

Would severe DKA be dramatic enough for you to validate her? \n\n She\u2019s 17 and her whole life is different now. She\u2019s a child. You\u2019re the parent. She\u2019s depressed because it sucks and she\u2019s struggling to adjust to her new reality. Consider the developmental stage of a 17 year old. Your sisters experience is helpful but she\u2019s had years and years to process this while your daughter is 2 months in. \n\nClearly you\u2019ve both got a lot on your plate. It\u2019s fucking ridiculous we live in a country where you had to pick up a second job to pay for a drug keeping her alive and it sucks that she\u2019s now dependent on machines and needles to manage her autoimmune disease, her body unfairly attacking itself. Still, I don\u2019t think starting with \u201cI\u2019m going to rehome your pets bc your mental health blows and you\u2019re not caring for them adequately \u201d was the move either.", "NAH\n\nYour daughter is in fact going through a lot, and it does sound like your empathy is running short. Maybe good reasons for that but she needs more support than she\u2019s getting and, while your relative\u2019s diagnosis makes it more blas\u00e9 for you, it\u2019s still a lot for her to work through. Support groups, therapy, etc should absolutely be high priority.\n\nYou are however NTA on the animal front - it sounds like you are at the end of your limit of what you can do with your time and money as you are carrying the entire family, your other kids are too little to do some of the work, and your animals do not deserve to suffer because of what your daughter is going through - and where the welfare of other, dependent creatures come to play, personally I am of the opinion that you either need to be able to put those other creatures first, or find them a home that can care for them properly. You are not the asshole for putting that choice to your daughter, and she is - understandable for a teenager, but still - too caught up in her own issues to have any thought about what the extra shifts mean for you or to even give a shit about the pets, and that makes her TA. She doesn\u2019t have to relearn how to walk, she hasn\u2019t had cancer or a stroke or something immediately debilitating, and to make the pets suffer is not ok. \n\nThe solution probably is to rehome the pets if you all don\u2019t have the capacity, that sounds like the kindest option for the animals which gives you and her more breathing room.", "Well the way you expressed it to your daughter that she needs to step it up definitely does make you an a-hole. No need to tell her to \u201cget her shit together.\u201d As you yourself stated, you hit a breaking-point. So I\u2019d assume you were angry and weren\u2019t actually thinking clearly.\n\nWhich isn\u2019t an excuse, you still said what you said. And I\u2019m sure you could have had an actual heartfelt conversation saying that you sympathize with her but she still has to be a productive human being. She\u2019s a big girl.\n\nAs for your point, you aren\u2019t wrong and wouldn\u2019t be an a-hole if you had expressed your feelings in a kindlier manner. But people make mistakes and fight, so give it a day or two and try to have an actual conversation without screaming and yelling like two mindful individuals.\n\nCheers.", "INFO - Have the things she likes to do declined after her diagnosis as much as her chores have?\n\nIt sounds like both of you talking with your SIL would benefit both of you.", "NAH. You both have a lot on your plate but that doesn\u2019t make it okay for your pets to be neglected. I think you framed the ultimatum poorly but as a mom exhausted working just one job I\u2019m not gonna judge you too harshly. I\u2019d recommend attempting to have the talk again and try to gently explain that if she can\u2019t handle helping with the pets anymore then they will need to go. Working two jobs as a single mom leaves you with limited time in the day. If she\u2019s falling behind on helping with chores, she\u2019s definitely not ready to work a part time job. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re super woman and capable of doing it all. You still have to set limits and try to care for yourself too. You both allowing all the responsibility to care for your numerous pets on the two very young siblings would be an ah move. If she insists she can\u2019t and you know you can\u2019t- the best and kindest option is seeking loving homes for the pets to go to instead.", "Yes YTA\n\nNot dramatic?? It\u2019s life threatening without on going treatment for the rest of her life. It\u2019s a high maintenance condition; if she slips up, she ends up in the emergency room. She needs time to grieve this diagnosis.\n\nDiabetes is characterized by high blood sugar, this makes your blood thicker and thus more likely to have cardiovascular issues over time like atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in the arteries) increasing risks for strokes and heart attacks later in life, issues with neuropathy, eye problems, feet problems, and many comorbidities. It affects the entire body, it affects her life expectancy!! The sugar in the blood not only makes it thicker, but the sugar particles are quite sharp and so they cause injury to the inner lining of the blood vessels causing them to get sticky and clump together and this is how atherosclerosis develops over time. \n\nWith type 1, the body cannot produce it\u2019s own insulin (insulin is what allows sugar into the cells for metabolism so this is why diabetics have high blood sugar) so she will forever need to take exogenous insulin forever to live and will need to make choices on her favourite way to inject needles into herself daily to get it. She will need to constantly have to check her blood sugar several times throughout the day, every day. If she neglects to manage this well, her body will begin to break down fats instead of sugars and the leftovers, ketones, will accumulate and will cause a metabolic imbalance that will create a medical emergency that is life threatening called diabetic ketoacidosis. \n\nDo you know all this? It\u2019s VERY dramatic. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s working through processing all of this information right now and as her parent, you owe her some compassion and understanding of this condition. \n\nI understand your concern for the animals and chores, but don\u2019t you think that is secondary to what\u2019s going on right now? You need to find another way to deal with this stress. And you 100% need to educate yourself more about this disease.", "YTA.  Your daughter has been diagnosed with a major, incurable medical condition that has a big impact on her life.  She\u2019s struggling with it so much that she\u2019s now failing all her classes, and you think the answer is to threaten and punish her because you somehow think her diagnosis isn\u2019t a big deal? \n\nYou are failing her as a parent right now.", "INFO: Her diagnosis wasn't dramatic to you or her?

I get you're upset and yes she has obligations but you're going at this the wrong way. You're expecting her to handle this as an adult who's used to the disease from forever when SHE JUST FOUND THIS OUT. She also still A CHILD. She's a mess of hormones because that's teenage years and just learned she has a condition that altered her life drastically. Yes she can't neglect her responsibilities but there are ways, this disease is emotional too and her emotional condition is going to directly impact her physical condition. She needs therapy and time to adjust and yes you can tell her you need her to tend to her animals, in a firm way without threats, have you even talked to her? You're making it sound like yeah this is her reality now but I've seen it, I've lived with someone who had it, she can manage, she needs to up and hustle NOW. There are ways that don't involve threats and you disregarding how life altering this is for her.", "YTA. Your daughter is adjusting to a serious lifelong condition, which is a big emotional burden.

However, it's important to approach the issue with empathy and understanding. Let's break down the situation and address your concerns.Firstly, it's crucial to acknowledge that a Type 1 diabetes diagnosis can be life-altering and emotionally challenging for a teenager. Adjusting to the necessary lifestyle changes, including managing blood sugar levels and taking insulin, can be overwhelming. It's possible that your daughter is still trying to come to terms with her diagnosis and may need some time to adjust.  \n\n\nIn future it might be helpful to approach this issue in a more supportive and compassionate manner. Instead of threatening to rehome the animals, consider having a calm and open conversation with your daughter. Express your concerns about her neglecting her responsibilities and the impact it's having on the family and her siblings. Try to listen to her perspective and understand the challenges she's facing. Encourage her to share her feelings, frustrations, and difficulties so you can better support her.", "YTA - imagine being 17, being diagnosed with a lifelong illness that can have all sorts of fun things happen, and requires frequent injections of insulin just to stay alive and being expected to process that in just a few short weeks, at 17, while having to deal with all the other coming of age bullshit that happens in the teens. \n\nPeople process things differently and while I sympathize with you, compassion and understanding don't seem to be very evident here. \n\nIt's not like she caught Covid and will be over it soon. This is a life changing diagnosis and failing to adequately deal with it can and does result in death.", "YTA.  You're the adult. You would be rehoming the pets because you can't care for them, not the children. Instead of it building to a breaking point did you talk to her about why she's not doing anything or did you just explode at her?", "Softly, YTA\n\nLook, I fully understand you are overwhelmed and rehoming some animals to better align with what you and your daughter can handle right now might very well be the right choice. \n\nWith that said, I think you focused a lot on you and your needs without trying to sympathize and understand what your daughter is going through. She just received some huge health news, her mom has to take a second job because of her* and she has a bunch more responsibilities now. That's really hard and she still just a teenager.\n\nThis would be much better handled to approach it as a team, rather than opponents. \n\n\n\n*well, really a crappy medical system but it probably feels like her fault.", "YTA\nI totally understand where you are coming from with your frustrations but it seems to me like your daughter is depressed and is neglecting her chores and schoolwork because of depression rather than laziness. Maybe just sit her down and have a talk with her about how she has been feeling lately. I would reassure her that you do not intend on rehoming the animals and that you are just feeling very overwhelmed lately and are worried about her. The last thing an anxious/depressed person needs is to feel like they are a burden. \nIf she is more comfortable talking with someone else about her personal issues a therapist or counselor might also be a good idea. Maybe meeting with other people with similar experiences is also a good idea.", "I was feeling pretty bad about my parenting today until I read this. Holy f---, YTA! Your daughter needs therapy, a support group, someone to help her process this literally life-changing diagnosis. \n\nAlso, rehoming pets is an AH thing to do in general, but is particularly awful when your daughter likely needs some furry friends to help her cope.", "NTA Animals cannot be neglected just because you feel upset.  You are not able to because you are working longer hours. If she can\u2019t step up, then the best thing is to rehome the animals where they will get care that they need. The animals cannot wait. They need feeding and care daily.  \n\nEdited to add: the cost of insulin should come down in the next year. I think Eli Lilly prices drop on July 1. Contact the manufacturer to see if you qualify for current reduced cost programs. You may need to switch brands of insulin (I.e. Lantus to Levemir) but your doc will work with you on that. They are used to this issue.", "YTA. Holy fuck, YTA. She's a diabetic. You have no fucking idea what that entails, how bad this degenerative disease is, how it can affect every fucking thing. Her pancreas does not fucking work. It affects everything. I'm a type 2 diabetic and my life went to shit. Get yourself educated. Talk to her endocrinologist not only about the disease but about getting affordable insulin.", "I think you should give her some time.

If you have more pets in the house than you can handle you may need to have serious conversations about that as a family but you can't just dump all that on your daughter when she's trying to figure out how to process this diagnosis. She's going through something scary right now and you should be there to support her. Obviously you're not entirely wrong that she will have to learn to work with her diagnosis if she wants to be successful in the future- but now is not the time, she needs love and support and a little leniency from you until she feels well enough to take those next steps. She also might need some therapy right now if that's a possibility.", "light yta\n\nI dont think asshole is the right would to express it but rather i think you need to treat the situation alot more delecately. While its not fair of you to say that she needs to \"get ehr shit together\" I think it is fair to expect her to contribute. Maybe having her taking care of things like feeding and cleaning up after them however you walk and/or do the physical tasks related to them. Don't let her illness ruin your relationship with her its important that you two trust each other and minimizing her illness and its affects is not fair to her as you can not truly know what she does or does not feel.

What will happen to the animals when 17yo moves out to college or her own home\u2026.. you\u2019ll have to rehome them anyway if you can\u2019t pick up the slack yourself.

That's sooooo devastating to a teenager, and her brain is not developed enough to make sense of those feelings. As someone who also has a lifetime diagnosis that will never ever get better, I cannot imagine how hard it would have been to have gotten my diagnosis in high school. That age is difficult enough, and this is a huge deal. It's understandable that she would have a lot of anger, frustration, and grief. \n\nHOWEVER.\n\nYou don't get to stop feeding your dogs because you are going through a really really hard time. That's not responsible pet ownership. If she weren't living with other people to pick up the slack, that would be animal abuse. A pet is a responsibility that can not be neglected or given up because things get hard. She took on the responsibility, and if she can't handle that responsibility, then the moral and ethical thing to do is rehome the animals.\n\nI'm so so sorry that the garbage healthcare in this country (because only America treats sick people like cash cows)  has forced you to take a second job to pay for her insulin. It makes me see red that so many people are in such financial hardship over *fucking medical bills*.", "Sorry, OP, but YTA. This is something she has to live with her ENTIRE LIFE. She's about to become an adult and now has to navigate her life with this looming over her. Of course she needs time to adjust! I doubt she's thinking just in the present; she's thinking ahead to college maybe, dating, what it will be like having kids with this disease, whether her life span will be shorter, etc. etc. All things she'll have to deal with long after you're gone. You are not the one who has it. I definitely understand managing a child who has different needs than others. This is your job as her mother. Talk to her to find out exactly what's bothering her. Find solutions together or positive affirmations she can practice. Her whole world has been turned upside-down. Is TD1 manageable? Sure. But it can still be dangerous and scary, especially for a child. Please be more understanding and compassionate.", "I'm sorry to add on, but yes, YTA. Your daughter is most likely still struggling. It's hard being diabetic and being newly diagnosed is scary. You may be 'well controlled', but the worry is always in the back of your mind. Did I calculate everything right? Did I eat enough? Did I take too much insulin?? \n\nAnd for a teenager who knows her mum had to get a second job to afford the meds?? Yep, even more worry. Mum's tired, and it's my fault. Mum's grumpy and frustrated, and it's my fault. Everything is my fault. She's probably depressed and trying not to let it show.", "Everyone I see is saying Y T A, but I disagree.

Your words to your daughter were harsh, but it sounds like you're all struggling right now. If there are other forms of community support that might be available to help your family adjust to its \"new normal\", it would be worth looking into them. (More work for you, I know!) For instance, there may be community organisations who could sponsor an insulin pump for your daughter, or volunteers who could help to take care of the animals while you're all adjusting. Your daughter might have access to counselling through her school or through a hospital social worker; it sounds like she is having a harder time with the emotional adjustment to her condition than to the medication regime as such. If her school is any good they should also be making some effort to help her get her grades back on track rather than putting all the work on her. Please try to be generous with her and also with yourself - it's a big change, and it's been less than two months since the diagnosis, after all.

Her body has to adjust physically to the insulin doses and wearing a Dexcom, and mentally to the magnitude of the diagnosis. If her blood glucose is frequently low this could affect her focus as well.\n\nThis is a big enough deal that it is understandable that she's struggling in school and with her household responsibilities.

Even though her diagnosis feels like the worst thing to happen to her ever, she'll adjust eventually.

In my country you pay the equivalent of maybe 12 dollars per vial? You can get more expensive ones too of course but it's usually not necessary. Unless we're talking about getting an insulin pump as well, you having to get a second job to pay for her insulin is ridiculous.\n\nAnd because of that you're overworked, tired and have shorter temper.

The 6 year old definitely, but even the 9 year old can't and shouldn't be really expected to take care of six animals on their own. Since mom can't and the 17 year old does not, the pets probably also suffer. It's not fair, but if 6 pets are too many to properly take care of at the time, they should be permanently or temporarily rehomed (if family members/friends can and are willing to help out) until things get better. That's just actual responsible pet ownership. Making six animals suffer (but at least not properly meeting their needs, unless we are talking about 5 different species of fishes and one dog) just so daughter can feel better is not.

The other two tests, one I nearly passed out before it was done and one I did pass out and had a legit seizure in the waiting room. Still the doctors refused to give a diagnosis because of my \"remarkably normal\" levels. Apparently under 100 and above about 60 is the standard? I'd usually test at roughly 70-80. It's shocking and remarkable because I'm \"morbidly obese\" and therefore it's surprising I don't have the other type. I'm 5'6\" and weighed (at the time) ~185.

Snacks might be one of those small snack size mini Hershey's, a handful of peanuts, peanut butter/crackers, sometimes a little handful of BBQ chips if it's that time of the month.\n\nI drink plenty of water, but when I feel faint, I drink a glass of orange juice with a spoon of sugar, or a half a bottle of soda, or have a candy bar. After an hour if I'm still feeling bad I have one of the above listed snacks, or fruit. \n\nI quit drinking altogether except a glass or two of wine on my birthday. I had a seizure four years back hanging out with my stepdad at a bar and all it took was a single sip of Smirnoff on an empty stomach. I never drink on an empty stomach anymore.\n\nI rarely drive, but that's more due to it being unnecessary and my fianc\u00e9 worried to death of literally anything happening to me, regardless of random infrequent seizures and low blood sugar.\n\nIt's been less disastrous than it once was, but sometimes if I take a very long shower or have been on my feet for hours at a time with no break it gets bad again. I can't get insulin because no doctor will diagnose. I've not been able to shed my pregnancy weight because just walking longer than 30 minutes will make me pass out.

You're obviously stressed, afraid for your daughter's health, and on top of all this you're working extra hours. You're not a superhuman. You're trying your best, and on top of that I think you're trying to process the fear that every parent of a diabetic feels - that the smallest slip-up could see your baby in hospital or even dead on the street. I think if you haven't had this talk with yourself it is important to do so. But I get that you're busy and you're ticking boxes: money, insulin, etc. and this is important ... no, essential. But there's also a huge emotional component to this that you need to acknowledge.\n\nYour daughter is grieving. She's grieving for the life she thought she would have. On top of being a teenager (which we all remember was a rough time!) she's got this massive life change. This grief will come in waves. On top of that there's the physical aspect. You don't just inject insulin and everything is okay. She's trying to manually balance an incredibly complex system with a lot of variables, from what she eats to how much she injects, and... just take it from me, it'll take her at least a couple of years to get things reasonable stable. If her blood sugar is too low she's going to feel like ripping the face off anyone who looks at her. if her blood sugar is too high she's going to struggle to stand up and she's going to have trouble thinking. When I was first diagnosed I sent some emails that were word soup but that I thought made complete sense at the time. It is hard for a non-diabetic to grasp how incredibly  difficult these initial stages are to handle. On your checklist you've ticked off \"got her insulin\" and you've done all you can **physically**, but emotionally your daughter is a mess, and she's going to have ups and downs for the next couple of years. \n\nNow as for the animals. I'm a huge animal lover. The fact that your pets aren't getting fed had me reaching for the \"asshole\" button, but then I calmed down. A 9 year old most definitely can feed animals. Is it fair to ask them? No. But there's nothing fair about this entire situation. It isn't \"fair\" that your daughter has diabetes. She did nothing to \"deserve\" this. Is it fair that she forgot to feed the animals a few times? No, but she's literally grappling with a huge life change and she's going to mess up. See above about my \"word soup\" emails. She's not thinking straight. This isn't just \"blood sugar\" - the brain runs on those sugars, and without them things go incredibly wonky. Does this mean she gets a free pass? No. But you can't snap at her because (and this is important) she literally cannot think straight right now. She isn't being \"bad\", she's just struggling. And she's going to be struggling for a while.  Her school work is going to go down the toilet for a while. Her social life is going to undergo major changes. Every part of her life is going to be affected.\n\nThis is an incredibly complicated situation, and it seems like what you all need to do is sit down and have a family meeting and talk about it. I realise that this may be easier said than done. You're working an extra job and you're worried and stressed. Your daughter is struggling with a major life change with physical and mental complications you can't even begin to comprehend. Your other kids are living in a house full of changes that they are struggling to deal with too. And the pets? They're just wondering where the food is. \n\nNobody is the asshole here, but you do need to deal with the situation or things are just going to get worse.

My point is your daughter got handed a life long burden, and yea she\u2019s having a hard time adjusting to it on top of being a 17 y/o girl. Take that girl to a therapist, it helped me cope with everything. That child needs some grace right now, and you\u2019re threatening her with punishment.", "Diabetes is dramatic at any level or time.  The fact that you automatically discount that means you have no clue as to what she is going through physically and mentally.

On one point of this yes she needs to do her part with her responsibilities but in her head she is probably overwhelmed with keeping health in check and not so much those animals.

This wasn't a smooth move, but you're clearly a caring and overwhelmed mom. You two need to sit down and have an open discussion about both of your needs and how they may be addressed. Please make sure to prioritize her feeling heard over you getting your immediate and practical needs met. It may take several conversations. You'll need to make some difficult decisions together, such as accepting that this semester is a total loss.\n\nI'm a 30-something LADA diabetic (type-1, late & slow onset). I was diagnosed at 30. My diagnosis was slightly dramatic - several years of failing health, continuously inching closer to burnout. Doctors couldn't find a cause. And then suddenly an infection that wouldn't clear and unexplained weight loss (20lbs in 10 weeks, while I'm usually a 6'3\" 165lbs beanstalk) put me in the hospital. The ER didn't think to do a finger prick and informed me it was probably cancer. Then my bloodwork came back with a 28mmol/L (504mg/dL) blood glucose.\n\nI'm in software engineering, with a background in psychology. My job is thinking. My job is problem solving. I always used to do projects in my evenings. Learning programming stuff, soldering things, studying math. See friends for dinner, hit the gym, study past midnight, sleep until 7. Endless energy, couldn't have enough stimuli. That mental energy never came back, and my diagnosis is the cause.\n\nThe first 6 months, I felt like a diabetic first and foremost. Getting anything else done was a bonus. I needed 18 months to learn to combine adulting and managing my sugar levels. Several years in and I am still dealing with physical ailments and limitations in energy levels that just weren't there before. High and low BG swings tire me out mentally like nothing I've experienced before.\n\nI miss my old energy levels and often feel like I'm doing less with my time than I could. I've started to read a lot about how other diabetics manage their energy levels. Both personal accounts and medical literature. Mostly it's doing less. Living a simpler life, with fewer responsibilities.\n\nAnd the more I read, the less that surprised me. I would like to recommend [this article](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/stress-diabetes-decisions-injecting-insulin/110149/). It references a 2014 Stanford study that found that insulin-dependent diabetics, on average, make 180 decisions a day just to manage their sugar levels. That number helped me put it in perspective: 180 decisions a day is on par with many jobs. I'm working an extra job.\n\nYour daughter is working an extra job, and it is a thankless job.\n\nIt gets easier with experience, but there will be setbacks. If she does it well she feels normal for an hour or two. If she fucks up, she ends up in the hospital.

Yes, you learn how to manage it likes it\u2019s a daily thing, but there can be a steep learning curve and it\u2019s *constant*. There is no break. There is no day where you get to not deal with insulin, not deal with checking glucose levels. There is no just taking off without making sure you have your medical devices and a snack. T1D is still relatively uncommon. Sure, she has an aunt with the condition. Ok, but then she goes to school where only like 3 other kids deal with it. Top that off with how everything is centered around food, right when you\u2019ve been diagnosed with a condition where you have to rethink your eating habits. So when all the other teenagers want to grab fast food or grab a big bunch of snacks and graze all night long or get a snack at the movies or grab an ice cream in the summer, it places on the daughter an extra mental load of managing her glucose plus, until she\u2019s at an acceptance stage, feeling like an outsider to these social moments that are so easy for everyone else. \n\nSo a teenage girl already in a difficult transition point in a young adult\u2019s life has had everything suddenly turned upside-down and now has to do multiple daily injections and multiple daily finger sticks and frequent doctor checkups and bloodwork and monitor all her supplies and make them her constant companion and is still *very very very* early in the learning process, and yeah she has a cool aunt but she\u2019s also got a very busy mom now telling her she\u2019s had enough of her shit? Because she isn\u2019t doing chores? This mom who has decided that because she has had a longtime relationship with someone T1D, that the daughter is of the same mind?

I can understand the daughter needing time to mentally and emotionally adjust to her diagnosis, and suffering from depression because of it, but letting her do nothing may not be helpful in the long term.
