Different types of support, different heights, and other things can factor into that. Not only would you be not as good at helping her around as a mobility device, it's possible that it could actually cause her pain to some degree. Obviously there's cases where it is needed (like stairs or if a mobility device isn't available) but this isn't actually needed, it would be a choice that you would be deciding to make, that isn't actually something that has to happen.
