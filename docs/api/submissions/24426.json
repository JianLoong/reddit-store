She was never going to pay to fix it. Never lend her anything ever again. Never speak to her again.", "Why should it be a secret? Your stepsister is the AH. And your mother. And stepfather.", "NTA\n\nJanice better figure out how to get it fixed before your course starts.  There\u2019s a reason it\u2019s called an accident and she was responsible for the laptop while she was using it.", "Definitely NTA and as someone with divorced parents I feel Beas for you going through this situation. Your mom either needs to pay themselves or make sure sister pays for the repairs. That or mom can front the money and have sister pay them back since your sister is an adult. Hell I\u2019m petty af so I\u2019d take sister\u2019s laptop until she gets mine repaired.", "You are absolutely not the AH. You told a family member the truth about something that was an accident. There is nothing wrong with that. Your stepsister is just projecting on you because she knows she screwed up, and can't fix it.", "NTA. Is Janice 20 or 2 because she is acting like a toddler. \n\nIt doesn't matter that she didn't mean to break it. She may not be to BLAME for breaking it, but she does have the RESPONSIBILTY for breaking it which means she needs to pay to repair or replace it.", "NTA your step sister is and your mum and step dad for not enforcing that she fixes it. Sorry who walks down a stairs while working on lap top you did her a favour by letting her use your lap top she rude.

You mum needs to really think about your needs here x", "No she Broke it she can pay for it. NTA.", "NTA \u2014 accident or not, she broke it and is responsible for fixing it. It was nice of you to let her use it, but I guess you won\u2019t do that again, for anything in the future. Your mom and step dad should step in to loan your stepsister the money to fix it and then she can pay them back.", "NTA - step soster broke it, step sister is responsible for fixing it. She's lucky your dad offered to help her pay for it! And mum/step dad are AH with step sister for not standing up for you. They should be angry that step sis broke laptop, and is refusing to get it fixed, accident or not. She was using YOUR property for HER work, and she is responsible for breaking it.", "NTA. Janice can go get a credit card, pay for the repairs, and then pay back her credit card. Never lend her anything again, sounds like she won\u2019t take responsibility for her actions.", "She was never going to save up and pay. That's an exaggeration to try and make you feel bad. And accidental damage, even if it's not on purpose, should still be rectified. There's a whole type of law devoted to getting compensated for accidents.\nNTA and I hope you can sort it - in the meantime do not let her borror a single thing again.

If she doesn\u2019t want to hear her name out of your mouth, she should not take your stuff, break it and not fixing. What an asshole", "NTA- SIL is TA. You need to let your mom, stepdad and dad know what she said. If I was you I would  get petty and not talk to her or say her name at all. Go out of your way to avoid even acknowledging her. (but thats just me)", "NTA. Janice borrowed your property, meaning it's Janice's responsibility to take care of it and return it to you in the same or better condition than when it was entrusted to her. While your property was in her possession, it was damaged. Regardless of whether the damage resulted from malicious, deliberate, careless, or purely accidental causes, Janice is legally and morally responsible for repairing or replacing your damaged property.", "NTA \n\nTake her to small claims court.", "NTA\n\nThat's really sad for you, especially given that funds are tight.  What brand/model was it?  I've personally had good luck carefully scrutinizing and purchasing used ThinkPads on eBay.  I sold (rare for me) an X1 Carbon 5th Gen for about $400 a year ago to a friend of my sister, and that model's going rate has seemingly dropped in half in the intervening time.   Bargains are out there if you know what you're doing.", "NTA, if you break it you pay for it. That's the most basic knowledge you learn even as a kid. If you can't admit that yes you broke it and it wasn't yours then yes you are going to have to pay for it. There is no \"snitching\" just saying the truth.", "NTA. She was never going to pay to fix your laptop. \n\nShe\u2019s just using your \u201csnitching\u201d (which is not actually what you did) as an excuse to let herself financially off the hook.", "Nta. Tell her if she\u2019s not going to replay it or fix it. You\u2019ll see her in court.", "Nta\n\nWhy was she using your laptop? And why was she walking down stairs while working on it? \n\nYour step sister, mom and step dad are the assholes.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like your were gossiping to her friends, or telling your dad to yell at her - you were venting without any intention of causing her negative attention or shame. You\u2019re allowed to be upset with something she did and to complain about that.\nAlso, she was never going to pay for your laptop lmao. She just decided to blame her own guilt on you and wanted to make you feel worse.\n\nAdvice re: graphic design course: depending on where you\u2019re taking it, you might be able to rent a laptop during that time. If you\u2019re going to university, most universities have computers for student use in common areas, and some have them available for loans to use while on campus. There are also some public libraries that allow computers to be loaned. \nDon\u2019t let this stop you from making the most of your class!!", "The only AH is Janice and your stepfather and mother.  It doesn't matter if they can't afford it; she broke it and she needs to make it right.  If they need to take a loan out; that is what they will do to make you whole.", "If the laptop was bought months ago before a year you can call the company and get the laptop repaired. If not purchase assurion is insurance for laptops all you have to do is pay 99 dollars and send the laptop for repair.", "NTA.

Accountability!  Are two words that aren\u2019t in everyone\u2019s vocabulary.\n\nHold her accountable", "NTA\n\nShe broke something and doesn't want to take responsibility for it, telling your dad isn't snitching, it's getting help. And now I'd be at: \"you own X, Y & Z, if you sell these things you can pay for the damage you caused.\"", "NTA. If it was your car instead the laptop, She would be liable for the damages, so, what's the poit to demand keeping it a secret? Too entitled...", "INFO: did she ask to borrow your laptop? if not you're NTA she is. and your mother is a complete AH for refusing to fix what HER daughter did", "Janice should be paying to repair.

She DID break it regardless if it was an accident and she IS responsible for repairing it ASAP. You did her a favor and now your schooling is threatened. Your dad is a saint and offered to help her pay for it because he knows how important it is! If she doesn\u2019t want to hear her name come out of your mouth then she can pay up immediately and not ask you for favors anymore.", "NTA- She 100% was never going to fix it. Stand your ground.", "Maybe Janice shouldn\u2019t have broken your laptop. Maybe she should t have borrowed it if she didn\u2019t want to take any responsibility for it.", "NTA - She broke it, she has to have it fixed.  And you can tell anyone your heart desires about it.", "Nta. It was an accident but she still did it.", "NTA. Speaking from experience, she was probably never planning to help fix that laptop if she had to throw that last part in.", "NTA. She broke it, she needs to fix it. But this is also on your mom and stepdad. They need to do some parenting here and hold Janice accountable for her actions. Could your mom and stepdad pay to have it fixed right away and then work out a payment plan for Janice to repay them?", "NTA- stepsister owes you a new laptop.", "NTA. She was never going to help. Break something of hers. Fairs fair.", "Tell JaNiCe she can pay to get in fixed in time for your course or you\u2019ll take it up in small claims court. As for having her name in your mouth ask if you should call her clumsy instead ?", "You need to take her to small claims and force her or the actual adults in the house to fix it.\n\nDon\u2019t loan her anything again, whether she fixes it or not.\n\nNTA", "Most laptop monitor screens can be easily fixed.  There\u2019s a whole cottage industry that sprang up about it.\n\nGo online and you\u2019ll find numerous sites where you can order a replacement, they\u2019ll ship it to you with instructions and even YouTube links.\n\nIt\u2019s been several years and my cost\u2014with shipping ranged from $59 to $90 and it usually took only about 30-45 minutes ( being super careful).\n\nTrust me\u2014the world is not coming to an end.

And obviously stepsister is the biggest of all", "Well, what's your plan? Your sister was never going to pay you back, the whole \"Well I was, but now that you did x, I'm not\" is BS. \n\nMaybe go pick up her laptop after it's repaired and hold on to it until she repairs yours.
