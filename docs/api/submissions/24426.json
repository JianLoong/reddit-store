Maybe worth looking into that.\n\nAlso NTA", "NTA.  She broke it.  Her intent doesn't change that; she was careless and broke it.\n\nYour mom, stepdad, and stepsisters are all adults, and they are all assholes.", "NTA.\n\nI would also speak with your mom. Regardless of the situation, having a rule you don't discuss ANYTHING that is negative with your father is not sustainable. While I'd see her point about things that relate to her, they must also relate to her and your father. In this case she's expecting you to lie overtly, or through omission about something HE bought for you. \n\nWhich begs the question, if you have something that is bothering you and can't speak to either of them you need someone who can be trusted who you can speak to. \n\nWith your sister, I would not let her use your laptop again. She is prone to distractions and the way she's used it and with her condition and behaviours, it seems a risk to herself as well.\n\nI would if possible try and get a job. It seems things are tight and some financial freedom would help and likely give you some independence. This likely would help remove you a bit from what I see as quite a controlling atmosphere.\n\nI'm really sorry about the laptop. I wish you luck.", "If she couldn't fix it she shouldn't have borrowed it. She borrowed it, she fixes it! Why don't people own their actions?\n\nNTA.", "Nta -but maybe reach out to your school.  They might have a loaner laptop or a program to help students get their laptops fixed", "NTA. Depending on the model you can probably repair it yourself. I watched a Youtube video to learn the repair process. Ordered a new screen from Amazon for less than $60 USD. Once I had the screen it took less than 10 minutes to fix.\n\nWhen hers gets back from repair 'accidently' spill pancake syrup on the keyboard.", "OP you need to have an \"accident\" with her laptop when she gets it back. \nAnd make sure to let her know that A. You do not have the money to fix it. B. It was an accident so she shouldn't be angry. C. If she tells your mom about it call her snitch and stop talking to her.", "NTA. She's 20 and a festering asshole: Take her to small claims court. She smashed up your laptop and refused to pay, then acts like she has moral high ground?\n\nTime for the spoiled stepsister to learn about consequences.", "Was the laptop bought on a credit card? Check your card, the insurance may cover it", "NTA, of course", "Is it just the screen that is broken? If so then you can plug a monitor into it and use it that way.", "NTA - You were kind enough to let her borrow it and she damaged it, and is offering no help. And that last little comment of hers seals that she's totally an asshole. How she was totally planning to fix it, but now she wasn't going to because you snitched. No, she wasn't. She's just trying to put herself off the hook some more.", "Small claims court, make it look more damaged to get every last penny, she deserves it", "NTA.  If this was my aughter in this situationI would calmly advise her to talk to her other parent and advise that should they not mediate the issue, you will have no choice but to sue your step sister for the cost of repair or replacement,  the inconvenience of this issue, and the court fees.  As your sister lives with them as well, she will be covered under the home owners/renters insurance for the home.  You should be able to find all the documents online to file the suit, so have them filled and ready.  It will cost around $100 to file, but as a student, you should be eligible for a fee waiver.  However if you Win and fees are part of the judgment, the court will talk them onto your sisters bill.  \n\nThis is a pretty cut and dry case, you lent sister laptop, she broke said laptop, she is responsible to fix/replace laptop.  Accidents do bot mitigate responsibility.", "You are not the asshole she was doing something while walking down the stairs and not paying attention and that is how someone gets seriously hurt she should pay half of it to get the laptop your dad gave you to get it fixed.", "NTA -- she had no business walking around with the laptop in her hand.", "Also, you can do this repair yourself. Purchasing the display from eBay is fairly inexpensive and videos on YouTube can help with the walk through.", "Why didn't your dad put on a goddamn condom ugh", "NTA for you. YTA to Janice, your mom, and stepdad though. I know she's an adult but your mom and stepdad need to back you up since she broke Your laptop that you kindly let her borrow with her irresponsibility. I feel terrible for your dad too because I'm sure he saved up to buy that and now she's ruined it.", "NTA and wtf, this is the kind of thing home insurance should cover (mine would, both health care for sis and new laptop for OP).", "All im saying is your stepsisters laptop would end up broken into pieces when she got it back if I was you if she refuses to fix what she broke", "NTA: First of all, who the hell does Janice think she is to tell you never to say your dad's name again?? And second of all, just because an accident happened doesn't mean that no one should know about it. Still confused on wtf Janice was saying like hello???", "NTA she should of paid \ud83d\udcaf \nDon\u2019t loan her shit again.", "Sounds like she needs to give you her repaired laptop and she can get your fixed when she has the money. Your sister is an entitled brat and I can't believe your mother is letting her behave like this. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nJanice owes you a laptop.", "NTA. She wasn't going to help you fix it, that was a bs excuse. Even the fact she said help you fix it shows she doesn't expect to have to pay for it all. She's a liar.", "She's 20? she sounds 12. An accident doesn't mean she's not responsible, and she's old enough to know what happens after an accident.

I'd expect there to be something showing installing a new screen on OP's laptop model.\n\nMuch more complicated if it has any touchscreen capabilities.

Even if she won\u2019t buy it for you, you can get one for super cheap, and maybe a mouse and key board, all this you could get for like 40$ just check what ports the laptop has first", "This-----it was so hard to teach my son when he was little that he still had to apologize for/make right things that happened that were accidents.

She breaks it.\n\nIf your laptop is fixed. She will expect to borrow it again. If you say no, I expect she will not speak to you. If she borrows it again, it will break and she will at most contribute a 1/3 towards it (or less).\n\nSo how good is this relationship?\n\nBecause even a friend, maybe even some people I hardly know, if they borrowed and broke something, they'd pay for the repair.", "Hey if you haven't found a way to fix it yet I might be able to help if you'd like", "I'm sorry, you don't have a good relationship with Janice. If you did, she would have apologized and worked out a payment plan for the damage.", "Real great relationship if she is careless and breaks something expensive of yours and insists she won\u2019t fix it. \n\nAnd real great relationship if she won\u2019t listen to you that you didn\u2019t know your dad texted her and you had EVERY RIGHT to tell him about a significant disappointment in your life since a) he\u2019s your dad and b) he bought the gift. \n\nAnd real great relationship to scream at you over the text from your dad, who offered to help her pay what SHE OWES, and she suddenly says oh she \u201cwas going to pay but won\u2019t now\u201d.  Uh huh. Right. Easy to say that now Janice. \n\nJanice sucks. I\u2019m sorry op.", "You are a minor so your dad would need to take it to court.

If they can't pay all in one go they can set a payment plan but they have to pay. Have a proper chat to them. If they won't then you know where you stand with your family and should make future decisions with that in mind.\nNTA good luck", "NTA. Let your mum know you\u2019d rather settle for a solution.

You\u2019d rather not fight or have to enforce that by being a bigger \u201csnitch\u201d (use the word she called you by). But you\u2019ll have to take that to law enforcement if she doesn\u2019t pay for proper repairs. You like living with them, so you\u2019d rather not do it, because you love them. But it\u2019s becoming an emergency on your side. Ask them to please help with this. \n\n\nAlso mention that you\u2019re worried about her chronic lack of care.
