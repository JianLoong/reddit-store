If the equipment breaks for any reason while in her possession she must make the lender whole.

She is 100% responsible for making the lender whole particularly when the lender is not in the business of lending out equipment.\n\nThe suggestion that the lender should bare any percentage of the loss is obscene.  The notion that the lender's father or other household members should split the cost is unacceptable.

Only children are held harmless by their parents for damage that they do.  If the child was not behaving poorly and did not intend the lamp to fall a parent may step in a accept the cost of repair or replacement.  For someone over 18 this option expires.  \n\nWhile not the case here there is the situation where the laptop fails on it own during the time when out on loan to the borrower.  In this case the borrower should offer to share in the cost of repair just do to the fact that it was in their care when the problem happened.
