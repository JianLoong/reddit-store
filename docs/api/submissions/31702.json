In order to make it special we wanted to get a large Airbnb down in Florida and have a vow renewal ceremony. We invited immediate family and friends who have been close to us, helped along our journey, or that we wanted to be closer to. We all stayed in the same Airbnb.\n\nIt should be noted that my family before our wedding was very Catholic. I am the oldest of 7 kids. When my wife and I got married they didn't come, saying that it was immoral to come because we didn't get married in the Catholic Church or that we weren't ready maturitywise (they can't make up their mind which it is). Thus starts a 10-year long roller coaster ride of trying to rebuild a relationship with them. For example, our wedding was in November and despite them not being there we tried to be the bigger people and decided to show up for family Christmas. We were thrown out, saying that we had hurt them. There are many more instances between my family and my wife and I, but it would take too long. Suffice it to say that they never made the wife really feel welcome in the family.\n\nThings with my family started off immediately at the Airbnb. My brother (we'll call him Bob) asked us as we were all arriving if his girlfriend (we'll call her Sara) could invite her mom and grandmother as they only live about an hour away from the Airbnb. We politely said no, stating that we wanted to keep the guest list to the people we invited. We found out later that they wanted to because they are super busy and can't make time to come down and that the grandmother is really sick. He then continued to ask if they could have a gender reveal party (Sara was pregnant at the time) while they were here as it is hard to get our large family together. For this one since the ceremony was on Saturday and most people were going to be arriving over the next couple of days, we said if they wanted to do something small that would be ok. Then the drama happened.\n\nSara was not happy that we used the word \"simple\", saying, \"Our baby isn't simple\". She was also not happy that we weren't allowing her mom and grandmother to come. My wife tries to talk to her to make her understand, but Sara immediately shuts her down. Several other pieces of drama happened, but after our ceremony, Bob drove off to get Sara's mom and grandmother and brought them back. My mom knew and told us that she was not telling him no and that, \"We had our day.\" My wife and I were livid. We left the Airbnb to drive back home and I didn't say goodbye to my family. Since then we haven't talked much with my family except to text them how pissed off we are.

It probably seemed like a good opportunity to fit in both, but maybe they made a mistake by not choosing just one.\n\nIt\u2019s almost an E S H, but I\u2019m going with YTA because IMO destination weddings are inherently selfish. It\u2019s expecting a lot of your guests, and the people getting married never seem to understand that their loved ones are sacrificing something to be there. For something that\u2019s infinitely less important to them than it is to you. I\u2019ve never heard of a destination renewal but that strikes me as even more selfish because renewals just aren\u2019t as significant as weddings.\n\nEssentially, you\u2019re upset that they\u2019ve wronged you by having lives and priorities that extend beyond yours.

If they had trashed the place you would have been held responsible.", "Newsflash: She didn\u2019t pay for it \u201cfor you.\u201d She paid for it to get the family together, your vow renewal was an opportunity/ excuse to do so. She thought of this as a family vacation on her dime and that\u2019s why she thought she was entitled to decide who could and couldn\u2019t come, who could and couldn\u2019t throw an additional party, etc. Did you even pick the location or was her input part of how you coincidentally ended up right by your brother\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s family? \n\nShe saw this as a family vacation that she paid for. She felt she was being generous by giving you all a whole day for the vow renewal. It\u2019s so obvious in her comment that you already had your day. In other words, she paid so she\u2019d have control. This is not her making an effort. I\u2019d be shocked if she cared at all about your vow renewal. This is simply her allowing you two to use part of the family vacation for your vow renewal (probably to get you to even come). You say it\u2019s tough to get the family together? Let\u2019s be real here, most people aren\u2019t going to travel for a destination vow renewal of just ten years for a couple whose wedding they didn\u2019t even want to come to. Especially over a holiday weekend. They probably all saw this as a family vacation/ rare chance to get together with your vow renewal as an obligation in the mix. Your brother and girlfriend probably only came because it was in close proximity to her family and she could see them. Other family probably only came because lodging was paid for and it\u2019s a holiday weekend so few people had to take as much time off work. Hence why as soon as it was over your mom was happy to switch to other events where the focus was on other people. She knew most people weren\u2019t actually there for your vow renewal as much as they were there to see family in a vacation home and connect with each other. That\u2019s also why your brother\u2019s girlfriend didn\u2019t like being restricted or told they could do something \u201csimple\u201d. If they all don\u2019t see your vow renewal as a big deal then they also aren\u2019t going to see other events as detracting from that and they are going to think you\u2019re the ones being unreasonable and controlling over a vacation home you didn\u2019t even pay for. Unless you had \u201cvow renewal events\u201d taking up the entire weekend, they likely think they fulfilled their obligation to you by showing up at all and sitting through it. So they don\u2019t get why you think you own their time after the ceremony was over. \n\nI think you missed the reality of how others thought about this trip. You thought you were there for your vow renewal. Others thought the vow renewal was a nice excuse to get family together and were much less interested in celebrating you as a couple. So they saw you as thwarting them from spending their vacation how they wanted whereas you saw them as not being focused on your marriage. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA, but you\u2019d be an asshole to yourself if you keep expecting your family to care about you to such an extent that they make you a priority over their own self-interests. They showed you ten years ago that that was never going to happen. Again, I\u2019d be very surprised if most of the people who came were there because they really wanted to celebrate the fact that you two managed 10 years of a marriage they didn\u2019t even support or want to happen in the first place. It\u2019s time to focus on the family you\u2019ve chosen and the people who have shown up for you since day one. The idea that you invited people you \u201cwanted to be closer with\u201d and expected them to act like they were already close to you is foolhardy. If you\u2019d invited people who were genuinely supportive of your relationship and marriage throughout the time you\u2019d been together would this even have been the guest list?", "This comment sums up everything perfectly. This whole event was never about celebrating OP\u2019s marriage. Very sad."]}
