{"id": 31702, "submission_id": "183jjm5", "title": "AITA For being mad at my family for allowing my brother to invite his girlfriend's mom and grandmother to our Vow Renewal?", "selftext": "My wife (30f) and I (35m) are coming up on our 10-year wedding anniversary. In order to make it special we wanted to get a large Airbnb down in Florida and have a vow renewal ceremony. We invited immediate family and friends who have been close to us, helped along our journey, or that we wanted to be closer to. We all stayed in the same Airbnb.\n\nIt should be noted that my family before our wedding was very Catholic. I am the oldest of 7 kids. When my wife and I got married they didn't come, saying that it was immoral to come because we didn't get married in the Catholic Church or that we weren't ready maturitywise (they can't make up their mind which it is). Thus starts a 10-year long roller coaster ride of trying to rebuild a relationship with them. For example, our wedding was in November and despite them not being there we tried to be the bigger people and decided to show up for family Christmas. We were thrown out, saying that we had hurt them. There are many more instances between my family and my wife and I, but it would take too long. Suffice it to say that they never made the wife really feel welcome in the family.\n\nThings with my family started off immediately at the Airbnb. My brother (we'll call him Bob) asked us as we were all arriving if his girlfriend (we'll call her Sara) could invite her mom and grandmother as they only live about an hour away from the Airbnb. We politely said no, stating that we wanted to keep the guest list to the people we invited. We found out later that they wanted to because they are super busy and can't make time to come down and that the grandmother is really sick. He then continued to ask if they could have a gender reveal party (Sara was pregnant at the time) while they were here as it is hard to get our large family together. For this one since the ceremony was on Saturday and most people were going to be arriving over the next couple of days, we said if they wanted to do something small that would be ok. Then the drama happened.\n\nSara was not happy that we used the word \"simple\", saying, \"Our baby isn't simple\". She was also not happy that we weren't allowing her mom and grandmother to come. My wife tries to talk to her to make her understand, but Sara immediately shuts her down. Several other pieces of drama happened, but after our ceremony, Bob drove off to get Sara's mom and grandmother and brought them back. My mom knew and told us that she was not telling him no and that, \"We had our day.\" My wife and I were livid. We left the Airbnb to drive back home and I didn't say goodbye to my family. Since then we haven't talked much with my family except to text them how pissed off we are.

I would stop trying to make them a part of your special life moments.", "Nta but why do you keep trying? I get it, it\u2019s hard for some pple to go LC/NC with family but you and your wife should really consider it for your mental health.", "NTA. But it might be time to stop worrying about your extended family and start focusing on your new family which includes you, the wife and kids if you have them. I have a lot of the same problems in my family with my wife and relatives and I literally just walked away after trying so much and said the people that want to see me will reach out the others will get left behind as a build a life for my wife and kids.", "NTA.

So your family won\u2019t attend your wedding because it was not held in a Catholic Church which is immoral but have no problem being proud of your unwed brother knocking up his gf? \n\nOP, let that sink in and then realize this was ***never*** about religion.  Your family simply does not like your wife and are using their religion to justify their contempt for her.  If they are still pulling this shit after 10 years they will ***never*** treat her differently.  It seems to me your family have now put you in the position where you need to chose between your wife and the people who clearly dislike her.", "NTA.  I too have a difficult family.  I currently consider myself an orphan with people who happen to be blood related alive.  Ie for example.  This year, I decided that we were not going to message everyone Happy Thanksgiving to anyone and see who messaged us.  No one.  Not a single phone call or message.  I'm ok with that.  Honestly.  I have my spouse.  That is my family now.  I don't need family who I have to work for to feel like I matter.  I hope you find that peace as well.  You deserve to be respected and happy.

They sound awful. Normal people do not behave this way. \n\nNTA", "ESH. You did agree to let Sara and Bob have a small gender reveal party and Bob likely brought Sara's mother and grandmother to the Airbnb for that reason. He didn't break your rule about not bringing them to your ceremony and if you meant you didn't want them at the Airbnb in general - which you mention in a comment that you didn't pay for - you should have been more clear about it. On the other hand, it sounds like Sara was intentionally trying to start a fight with you over nothing and your family sound dysfunctional and nothing but drama in general. It may be time to consider going low or no contact with them for your own sake and that of your wife, who you admit they have never welcomed into the family.", "\r  \nNTA - It's completely understandable that you're upset about your brother bringing uninvited guests to your vow renewal, especially considering the history of strained relationships with your family and the effort you've put into rebuilding those connections over the years.", "NTA.

You said \u201cWe politely said no, stating that we wanted to keep the guest list to the people we invited.\u201d I read this as you didn\u2019t want Mom and Grandmother at the vow renewal (understandable). Bob went to get them AFTER the ceremony. You got your vow renewal with your immediate family and friends just as you wanted.

The family lives by the idea of \u201cask for an inch; take a mile.\u201d You had the idea of the weekend being about you and your wife. Your mom and brother turned the weekend into a family weekend and made it about them. Your mom probably paid for the Airbnb with this in mind. \n\nNTA", "Where are the catholic crazies now that your brother is having a kid out of wedlock. They should be shaming him every day if they weren\u2019t hypocrites. NTA and go NC with the family.", "NTA but why oh WHY do you put up with ANY of these people? At ALL? \n\nThey're horrible, and what's worse is that they are not going to change. The sooner you realize that, the happier you'll be.", "Send them videos of gender reveals starting forest fires etc and ask again why \u2018simple\u2019 isn\u2019t a reasonable request.  \n\nNTA but your mom definitely had different plans than you did.", "I won't call you an asshole, but I have to wonder why you invited this fractious family to your vow renewal.", "Your family are a bunch of entitled jerks.  Why maintain any relationship with these people after the way they have treated you and especially your wife?  They banned you from Christmas FFS!!  They still have not made your wife welcome in the family.  Why are you getting an AirBNB with these people??  Are you a glutton for punishment?  Do you think your parents and family will magically change and all will be unicorns and rainbows from now on??  Open your eyes OP.  Cut these people out of your life.  They don't care about you.  They definitely don't care about your wife.  Your brother and his wife suck.  Your parents really really suck.  Tell them all you want nothing more to do with them.  You don't need them.  Put your wife first and tell your family they are a bunch of shitty relations who do not deserve a relationship with your wife.  And if you ever have kids, don't let your family within 100 miles of them.", "You're mad at your family because your family is a study in assholery.\n\nNTA.

Wasn\u2019t able to put in the post, but they were able to stay later in Florida to have time with them.", "It seems like it was the plan to use the Airbnb for the gender reveal.

This is NOT about religion. They for some reason dislike your wife. Is she a different ethnicity than your family? Whatever it is, this is the time you need to start thinking about your future. In 10 years they still don't care about **either** of you. They never will. If you guys have kids, they will be treated just as harsh as you both are. Is thay something you want to deal with?\n\nI'm sorry your family sucks, but I don't see any relationship worth saving with any of them at this point. If a complete internet stranger can see this just from your one post, I don't know how you can't.", "Created families are often so much better than what we were born into.  I know you and your wife are going to rock the next 70 + years!  Happy Belated Thanksgiving to you too!", "That does change things a little since it seems like they brought the mother and grandmother afterwards either as retaliation for the argument or had been planning to bring them all along without your consent but since you didn't pay for the Airbnb and they still didn't bring them to the ceremony itself, I still hesitate to say NTA."]}
