But pretty nature names???? How in tf r people drawing the line at hawthorn??? Do we not remember our homie who wrote the scarlet letter?", "Also lied about daughter being able to name baby. They should've asked her for suggestions not allow her to think she had to power to choose", "Right? Dont start shit, don\u2019t get shit. Tom brought this on himself. He had it coming.", "Out here naming the baby Blue-footed Booby", "I hope her name's not Swallow. That would be so very bad...", "There\u2019s a tufted titmouse brand vodka.", "I immediately thought of that, too.", "Mountains and rivers, cute mix.", "I am so jealous, thats what I wanted to name my youngest girl.  Sadly outvoted, but she likes her actual name and it fits her so all is well.", "Your BIL can tell his daughter that she can suggest them ideas, but the parents decide baby's name. Problem solved. And to be nice to daughter, use one of her suggestions as a middle name. But no,  he needs to be impolite, judgemental and lying. BIL is an A H, you are not!", "They could take one of her suggestions as middle name to honor the siblingbond and choose first name themselves. Problem solved. BIL is \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc", "I love all the suggestions she gave! I always wanted to name my future daughter Lark.", "My sister has both of those in her full name, and one was my mothers middle. \n\nI was almost named after a Disney Princess. Got the second half, but Briar was vetoed.", "Your just as much a AH as BIL \u201cit\u2019s better than Sarah or Elizabeth \u201c", "There\u2019s no need to denigrate some names in defense of others.", "My name is Elizabeth.  I knew *five* other Elizabeth's in middle school. None of us knew who was being spoken to when more than one of us were in a room, and to me that felt like I wasn't an individual, I was just one of a set of 5.\n\nBoth of my daughters have unique names; my youngest is Arienette because I fell in love with it during a song, and she never has to worry that the teacher is talking to \"the other Arienette\". She is an individual. The only one. And her name is beautiful.", "I'm technically an Elizabeth, but there are plenty of nicknames to use. None for Sarah, tho lol", "As a Sarah Elizabeth I sometimes wish I had a cooler name growing up. It was easy to find my name on keychains though.", "As a Sara who always wanted a nature name I fit this description.", "Deep from the heart, with my name being Sarah and my sisters's being Elizabeth, I give an OUCH.", "I went to HS with a few Laura's (my name) but nowadays it's kind of rare. When I had both my boys we decided we didn't want to name them after anyone so scrolling through name lists we picked Soren and Ezra.", "My name is very common. There are probably millions with my first and maybe half that with my last. I wish i had an awesome, unique name.", "It also hurts when you are named the popular name, but you aren't popular. I eventually stopped turning around when people yelled my name in a public place.  They were never talking to me.", "We have two Jessica W.'s and THREE Stephanie G.'s on my team at work. We have to refer to them by full last name, which is otherwise completely not my company culture. Unique names are great for the people around you, too -- at least you are easily identifiable.", "I have one of the common names they're talking about and I don't think anything they're saying is all that bad. I went through a period of hating my name because of how common it is. I embrace it now but I would definitely not choose to name a kid something as common as my name was", "It's not hate? It's talking about how frustrating it is to have the same name as a bunch of other people in their class. I have a name that was really common in my age group, and one of the others had the same initial in their last name so we got sat next to each other all the fucking time and it was annoying. I like my name and I wouldn't change it, but I wish it wasn't so common", "I have a very common name.  When I was at school it seemed to be either a common first name, or every other girls middle name.  I would have been so grateful for an unique name."]}
