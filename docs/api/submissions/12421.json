My name didn't make me unique, my weird a$$ personality does. To be fair I don't hate the list the kid gave, only one of those names I loathe and it's a nail of chalk boards for me type reaction. However, if your not going to let the kid pick what she likes they shouldn't have made a deal. I personally don't comment on anyone's name choice because it's not a hill for me, name your kid what you want, only person will know I hate it is my husband and my bff in pettiness, otherwise I make a passing comment about originality or how that's great.... Simple and easy.... So definitely op NTA, and really they should maybe pick a first name and choose the one of the daughter's name choice as a middle to save this debacle."]}
