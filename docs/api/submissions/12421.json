Valerie has an 8 year old daughter who Tom adopted last year. Valerie and Tom are expecting another baby together. Their daughter had suggestions for names for her baby brother or sister. Namely names that were nature themed (Wren, Dove, Lark, River, Hawthorn, Forrest, Cove, Ocean). My name is actually among one she suggested. My own brother has a bird name along with me lol. Tom proceeded to tell his daughter that those were not real names and that I had always disliked/hated my name and they didn't want their little baby to be the same. He said this in front of me and my husband. My husband thought he was crazy and told him I had never said that. Tom glared at my husband. Then his daughter asked me if I hated my name and I said I didn't. Valerie said it didn't really matter what I thought, but they didn't want their kid to have a weird name and she told their daughter they wanted baby to have a lovely name like she has. Their daughter said she liked my name better and didn't think her name was nice. My husband and Tom's parents were like, let's not insult other people's names when Tom and Valerie started to protest and reminded them that they were in the presence of someone with one of the so called \"ridiculous names\".\n\nFast forward on a couple of hours and Tom came over and told me I needed to tell his daughter that names like mine do not work on people and that I want her to stop wanting a sibling called that and start embracing her name and the name they will give her future sibling. He told me just because I wanted to live like a freak with a weird ass name didn't mean he wanted that for his kids.\n\nI told him he was a lying asshole for putting words in my mouth and expecting me to do the same. I told him nobody said he needed to like my name, but to insult it, to insult me and then ask me to lie with him was unbelievable. I told him I didn't need to lie for him and wouldn't and to get out of my fucking face.\n\nMy husband and I left almost immediately after, apologizing for leaving abruptly to my ILs and to our niece. Tom called my husband after and said his daughter could have heard and I was an asshole for saying what I did to him when she was in the house. My husband disagreed but I do wonder if I went too far.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678951085, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11sn1ly/aita_for_telling_my_husbands_brother_hes_a_lying/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I had an uncommon name growing up and I know there are pros and cons. I didn't meet another Trinity until I was 15, whereas I had 2-4 Sarahs and Matts in class every year.

Unique names (within reason) are beautiful. Those nature names are great, and not so ridiculously unique to cause discomfort. They have a right to name their child whatever they want, but they do not have a right to disparage you, or anyone else with these lovely names, and they absolutely have no right to demand you participate.
