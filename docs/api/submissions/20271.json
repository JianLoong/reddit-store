We all live within fairly close proximity to one another so, a good portion of the time one of them will be visiting with another or a couple.\n\nFor the past 3 years, my wife's work situation has not been great. They've seen a lot of turnover, management has been shaken up, so, there's been a lot of uncertainty. She found herself just fearful she'd be let go and she comfort ate through that concern. She's probably 100 pounds overweight at this point.\n\nDid I believe it to be the healthiest way to deal with the stress? No, but I also wasn't going to make things worse for her by getting on her about her eating and resulting weight gain.\n\nI half expected her siblings to say something at some point over the past couple years and whether it was because they were taking my lead or not, I don't know, but, they didn't bring it up until recently.\n\nWe were at my brother-in-law's house, every sibling was over there and they were talking about going on a bike ride at some point this summer. The oldest(47M) turns to my wife and tells her she NEEDS to do it. My wife asked why she absolutely needed to do it.\n\nAlmost as if this had been bubbling up for a while, they all piled on my wife about how they've watched her over-eat these past few years, they've noticed how big she's gotten, and it went on like this.\n\nI stepped in, and I'll admit my tone wasn't great, I asked if anyone actually had anything productive to say, and said if nobody did, we should move on.\n\nThey then made it an indictment on me. Told me that everything they're saying are things I should've said. When I made the case that she's stressed, that was labeled a cop out and was all the more reason for her to exercise.

You should defend your wife! Sure, they\u2019re are better ways for her to handle her stress and emotions *and* you should/could\u2019ve been addressed sooner but for them to all gang on on her was cruel in my opinion! If they were so worried about her all this time and her weight gain why didn\u2019t anyone approach her privately and gently??", "NTA -- are they gonna do something about the stress, and help her get to a better place?  Dog-piling her about her weight seems pretty crappy.\n\nFor that matter -- can you help her get some counseling or a better job?", "NTA. What you are is an understanding spouse who sticks up for your wife. I\u2019m sure your wife is aware of her weight gain. I\u2019m sure she knows what she needs to do if she wants to lose weight. Her family tried to fat-shame her, and you were right to shut them down. Bravo.", "NTA - I think you shutting it down was exactly right. She\u2019s a woman and I can guarantee in our society she is not oblivious to the fact she has gained weight. No one should be commenting on anyone\u2019s body at all, first and foremost. But if you have genuine concerns for her health (and not just how she looks) I think the best way to approach it is do activities together that involve healthy, no-pressure-to-lose-weight, movement. Maybe take over cooking a few nights a week or help her plan (and shop) healthier meals you can cook together. Talking about her weight gain could add additional stress or trigger her if it is indeed some form of disordered eating. Therapy could be a good thing too to get to the root of the issue and stress management.", "NTA. Having been there myself, your wife *knows* about the weight she\u2019s put on. She doesn\u2019t need a self-important sibling rubbing it into her face. What you did was not only a good thing, but necessary. \n\nThey had no reason to be jumping on her (or you) without being in her position. If they *truly* wanted to help, they would either offer to help reduce her stress or make an offer and then back off and let her accept it in her own time. \n\nWhat they were actually doing was making themselves feel superior by attacking their baby sister, which is horrid. And then they justify it by *helping*. The truth is they are horrible, selfish people. \n\nYou, on the other hand, are a good and loving human and wonderful human being. And give your wife a big hug - we are all rooting for her!", "NTA. Her sibs are. Do they think *she* doesn't know she's gained weight??!! She knows.

However, I believe that a good spouse would find a way to express that the lifestyle isn\u2019t healthy, in fact it\u2019s dangerous. But heads up for you, standing by and supporting your spouse.", "They were not doing an intervention.  They were doing a pile on session.

It's not your responsibility to control how and when she eats, she's a grown adult.  I also doubt that she's entirely clueless that she's gained weight, so pointing it out is not only not your job, it probably wouldn't have been helpful.  \n\nIt also really doesn't sound like they were approaching her about their \"concerns\" with any degree of kindness or understanding, they were just making unsolicited comments about what they think she should and shouldn't do and how THEY think she should take care of her body.

I thought the only way to lose weight was to be miserable.\n\n A few months ago, I ended up just taking walks everyday and eating only when I felt hungry and stopping when I was full (none of that clean your plate bs).

Thank you for the stance regarding her weight gain. I've jumped up in weight after I started caregiving my parents. When this happens I guarantee we know that's it's not good for our health.
