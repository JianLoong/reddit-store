Of course, I needed to get permission from my mother (46f) to go. I told her about it and I guess I gave her the impression that she was invited too. \n\nThe first time I ever went to my friends house, my mom had the brilliant idea of bringing my dog along with us (even though I told her it was a bad idea) since I told her that they also had a dog. The mom of course got upset because she literally brought an animal to her house upon meeting her for the first time without asking. My friend also said that her dog does not deal well with smaller dogs and if she was out, her dog would have attacked mine. So obviously my friends mother does not like my mom. The other reason I didn\u2019t want her going was because she kind of embarrasses me. I wouldn\u2019t say my mom is a helicopter parent but wherever I am with my friends, she has to be there. \n\nIf I\u2019m sitting at the restaurant with my friends waiting for a performance at my school, my mom is sitting in the booth with us. If I\u2019m at the performance, she\u2019s sitting in between us. When we\u2019re out shopping, she\u2019s the only parent that follows us around the store. She also says some really out of pocket and just weird things to my friends which made them uncomfortable. For example, telling my male friends that they need to listen to my female friends conversations more often because it will help them to get a wife in the future. \n\nAnyways, my mom and my dad were sitting at the table and I decided to just tell my mom why I didn\u2019t want her at the Christmas party. She got kind of offended and said that if my friends mom didn\u2019t want the dog in the house she should have said something upon seeing the dog but my dad and I both agreed that my mom was still wrong to do it in the first place. My mom looked sad and went in her room. She didn\u2019t even say goodnight to me. My dad told me that she cried. \n\nHe thinks I was harsh to tell her the reason my friends mom doesn\u2019t like her and that she embarrasses me instead of just letting her go to the party but I think it is better for her to know so stuff like this doesn\u2019t happen in the future.

It's crazy to bring a dog over to someone's house without even asking first. It's not a kid.", "NTA, you\u2019re mom sounds to me like she\u2019s trying to relive her youth through you. Hanging out with your friends, coming to parties you\u2019re invited to, etc. Being blunt with her was the best way to get it through her head that she\u2019s not young anymore, she can\u2019t hang out with teenagers. Maybe you could try apologizing for the harsh language/tone but make it clear you were at your breaking point and it needed to be said.", "NTA. your mother sounds like a piece of work. \n\n1) baffled as to why she thought she could show up with a dog and not an ounce of warning. you always ask. every time. i\u2019m even more baffled that she was so surprised about it that she cried. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s entitled or oblivious, but it\u2019s a problem either way.\n\n2) the friends thing. that\u2019s actually fucked. im extremely blunt and what i\u2019d do is look your mother directly in her eye and say \u201cyou are not my friend and you are not friends with my friends. you are my mother and to them, you are an adult stranger saying inappropriately mature things to a minor. you are not making them feel safe, comfortable, or entertained. you are making them and me uncomfortable.\u201d", "NTA. Your mother needed to hear the truth. She might be upset, but now she know she can work on changing her behaviour.", "INFO: Was your mom and the other parents invited to the Christmas party?\n\nOk. I see further down that no. Why on earth would your mother want to be a Christmas party with teenagers? You may have been somewhat tactless and said too much (like about how friend's mom doesn't like her), but she needs to know that NO PARENTS ARE INVITED to the party. I know I'd feel bad if I made my mom cry, but she has to learn to let go. Her behavior is inappropriate for a parent of a teenager. \n\nDo you think she just wants to be \"one of the gang\" or do you think she can't let go of you?", "NTA. Do apologize to your mom for being so blunt and harsh. Let her know you love her, but you just want to be able to hang out with your friends on your own. She will appreciate the apology, and hopefully realize she was in the wrong. Know that your mom just loves you, but she is wrong for trying to hold on to her youth through you. Good for you for speaking up, with time you will learn to be more gentle.", "Jfc NTA to the max. Your mom has issues regarding boundaries and it seems your father agrees. Sit down with your old man and tell him everything you dislike about your mothers behavior and reinforce that its causing issues not just for you but those you are close to. \nShe is a helicopter parent, full stop.\n\nYou're old enough to be trusted with going out alone, following curfews or even making plans without your mothers permission. Letting them know is one thing but expecting to have a parent tag along with everything you do is suffocating. Im sure its already affected your social life, so before it gets more complex you need to set firm boundaries and explain that what she is doing is too much. Remind her that you love her and appreciate her support, but also remind her she goes too far. (Inviting herself to parties and being entitled enough to bring your pet into a random household without permission)", "NTA.  Next time, enlist your dad's help with these conversations.  Perhaps he can say it in a way that helps her understand without hurt feelings.  Your mom needs to know the truth.  There is not a mother on the planet that wants to be an embarrassment to their child.  She might have hurt feelings now, but if she truly wants what is best for all, she will listen to you and modify her behavior.", "NTA. It was well past time for some honesty. Now, your mother has an opportunity to rethink her behavior and change.", "NTA, it doesn't sound like you said it unkindly. People need to be called out when they do inappropriate things so they can learn from it. I will tell you this kiddo, all families are embarrassing and I'm sure more than being called out for the dog thing that if you told her you were embarrassed by her being around thats probably what hurt her feelings the most. NAH if that's the situation. Teens grow apart from their parents and your mom may be struggling to see you become more independent and also notice that you are distancing yourself so she has been overcompensating by always being around. Maybe make time to hang out with her, even if it's just for a few hours a week and talk.", "NTA. She desperately needed to hear the truth.", "NTA. This isn't harsh just because it's negative. You're at an age to start practicing standing up for yourself and it sounds like your mom could use a reality check.\n\nA useful sentence starter for that is, \"When you..., I feel...\" As in, when you follow us around the mall when no other parents do, I feel like you don't trust me. Or, when you brought the dog to my friend's house when I asked you not to, I felt embarrassed and disrespected. Etc.", "Hmmm this is a tough one. Without knowing HOW you told her, the way you delivered the conversation, it's hard for me to vote. But I suspect that, since you are seemingly bothered by this, that maybe you didn't come across as tactful and sensitive. That being said....  \n\n\nYour mom's behavior does seem a little much and as a  year old, you're definitely at an age where you deserve to have your own space and your own time. Her inviting herself along for EVERYTHING is a little unusual for a parent of a child your age. I get that you would want some autonomy and freedom. That's absolutely fair.   \n\n\nPlus, you don't want your friends to be uncomfortable and that is well-meant. And you're right that your mom should have consulted the other mom before just assuming it was okay to bring your dog along. Some people's dogs (like mine and your friend's) don't do well with other dogs. Some people are allergic to dogs. Some people just don't like dogs....You shouldn't ever just bring along a dog...Especially if it's your first time meeting; at least not without checking first.   \n\n\nSo, my point is: You bring up some very valid points. And communication is super important. And, you're right: If you don't mention it, how's your mom gonna know? How's anything gonna change? So, I think that having the conversation doesn't make you an a hole, in itself. And you're definitely not responsible for how your mother reacts/ed to what you say. But you ARE responsible for coming from a place of tact and sensitivity when delivering the conversation. \n\nThat being said, then...That's where my dilemma lies in voting. Because I don't know how you delivered the information. But I guess I'll just go with NTA. Because you weren't necessarily trying to be mean. You just want more autonomy and stuff.", "Will there be other moms at this party?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The other reason is that they're teenagers with their own interests; they're in a different stage of life that I already went through decades ago.

Knowledge for finding that proper balance is out there. I sincerely suggest and hope that your mother finds it and employs it.\n\nOP You Are NTA!!"]}
