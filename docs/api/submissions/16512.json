Our divorce was pretty friendly considering we mad such a bad couple and when he met his wife Gwen I really liked her and the two of us got along so well. She said Indie was such a sweet kid and how excited she was to be part of her life. I loved it for Indie and Indie really liked Gwen. But right around the time Gwen and my ex bought a house together things went downhill. Gwen has three children ages 12, 10 and 8 and they dislike Indie. There seems to be some jealousy there because Gwen was nice to Indie. Indie has talked about the kids saying mean stuff (like she doesn't belong, that she's dumb, that nobody likes her or wants her around). Indie told her dad and Gwen and they assured her it would get better and they would handle it. But nothing has changed and whenever Indie is with the whole family she ends up being told by the kids that they don't want her there, they have fits over having to include her in activities and Gwen and my ex have started telling her that she just needs to \"wait a bit\" and she can have a turn with one of them after. But they always forget about it by the time Gwen's kids are finished. She said when it's just her and Gwen it's even worse because Gwen's kids hate when she speaks to her and that just makes them more angry with her. She told me she doesn't like spending time with the family anymore.\n\nAnd to make things even worse, Gwen has complained to me about Indie \"pulling away\" and \"seeming less interested\" and I brought up what Indie was saying and she said if she seemed more interested she would include her but she just doesn't seem to want to be around anymore. My ex was like what do you want me to do, Gwen's kids don't like me either.\n\nSo when my ex asked if we could swap Mother's Day weekend this year, so Indie could be with them, because they are doing a Mother's Day weekend trip and Indie should be there, I said no. He was like come on, you can even get extra time and I said no. He asked why and I said I wanted my daughter for Mother's Day and it was final. He told me Indie shouldn't miss out on the trip. I told him she's missing out on nothing other than a weekend of being excluded and treated like an outcast and feeling like she has to be careful of having Gwen's attention because her stepsiblings will hate her for it. He told me it doesn't mean she wouldn't enjoy it.\n\nEx said I was being unfair and unreasonable. \n\nAITA?\n\nAdding before I post: I did not ask Indie if she wants to go because she has expressed repeatedly how she hates doing trips with them and how she wishes she could stay with me when they go places. So that is enough for me to say she would not want to be there... She also doesn't like Gwen as much since she feels like she gets forgotten. She also feels that way about her dad too.", "created_utc": 1683363727, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/139hhcw/aita_for_refusing_to_swap_mothers_day_weekend/", "score": 972, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are her mother, not Gwen, and it seems like making her go would be punishing you and her unnecessarily when it's your day. Your ex needs to do something about this situation. He is alienating your daughter from his family by not stepping up, yet seems to be laying the responsibility on a 7 year old to fix the situation. The 12 year old and 10 year old and definitely old enough to both know and be told what they are doing is not on and to have some form of punishment as a result of their actions.\n\nYour job is to make sure Indie is happy, and it certainly sounds like she isn't enjoying her time there.

Have your holiday with your daughter and give her all the attention she deserves without the stipulations that she gets over there.", "NTA but I think you should be honest with your ex about why you won\u2019t swap. He might need a wake up call to realise that his lack of action over his new wife\u2019s kids is what\u2019s ruining his relationship with indie, not the fact that you won\u2019t swap.\nIt also sounds like indie would benefit from some one on one time with just her dad, instead of dad + \u2018new family\u2019", "NTA your job is to protect your kid from being bullied. It\u2019s time to stamp this out. Either your ex starts dealing with things or you prepare for another court battle", "NTA. But you should still ask Indie.

They want indie there because abusing her is their way to reinforce their identity as a family. Gwen's kids clearly have some serious insecurity issues about their mother's love. Indie will always be the outsider bc her presence helps them direct their nastiness at a common enemy. Don't subject your daughter to that. It will damage her self esteem beyond repair. Stand up for her. If you don't, no one will and nothing will change. Reduce time indie spends with them. She is too young to deal with the older kids abuse. Kids need to be taught manners. The idea that it will magically stop is pure evil and laziness. I think Gwen likes the children fighting over her and making her kids the \"in group\". Kids are just responding to clues from mom. She's playing princess and wants everyone to make sure indies position is known as a second class person.  Gwen's house will always be a place where indie learns she doesn't fit in. Don't subject your baby to that.", "Nta.\n\nIf you have a custody agreement in place, it needs to be re-evaluated.", "NTA at all. He's TA for even asking", "NTA.

You are her mom, not Gwen. And your ex and Gwen need to get into family therapy with her kids ASAP.

He is married to a woman whose children don't like him; that must be a terrific household. He should be expected to be doing everything he can to improve his relationship with his stepchildren. Gwen should be doing everything she can as well. Professional help is probably necessary. Did they even think about this situation before they married and moved in together? \n\nMeanwhile, your daughter should not be subjected to this toxicity. You should tell your ex and Gwen that Indie's time with them will be severely limited until they can provide an atmosphere for her that is loving and welcoming, which is not going to happen until Gwen's children stop disliking their new stepfather. Stand your ground! Good luck.", "Nta.

That way Indy won't have to endure being bullied 50% of the time and can spend 1-1 time with her Dad.

It's not easy to just get children to get along and accept each other as family. I understand seeing your child in distress is hard but you seem to expect your ex's wife to simply fix it. You can stop the children from being mean but you can't force them to accept. You never mentioned how long it's been so I will assume less than a year, given how you mention the ages. These things will take time and persistence. \n\nAt the end of the day it is your daughter and your day. However, you could have asked her instead of assuming and you don't seem to consider that a joint trip may help them bond while missing out may only solidify that your daughter is not a part of this new family. But, they could have chosen to do the trip on another day than Mother's Day and on a day that they have her.\n\nSeeing how your ex isn't here to defend himself I have to take what you say with a grain of salt. I get the suspicion that you are putting your own feelings into this rather than actually doing what is best for your daughter. That you want the weekend to be yours is all well but I'm not buying that protecting your daughter is the main reason.", "YTA reading your post it seems to me that you get all of this information out of a 7yo.
