And I'm sure that if she didn't break up with you you wouldn't have asked for anything.\n\nand maybe you think of yourself as a nice guy too right? YTA\n\nOh I have another analogy, it is like men thinking they are entitled to sex just because they asked a woman out and paid for dinner. You are not entitled to anything. It is already too much that she give you 300$. If it was me I wouldn't have given you anything.", "YTA \n\nTWO MONTHS later!!! Dude you\u2019re being a stalker forget the money! You went 2 whole months without that money or thinking about it. Leave that woman alone!", "YTA. Why were you \"short\" with her during the vacation and how did what she owed you magically grow from $300 to $600 over two months? I can understand the next day but stewing over the numbers for two months? That must have been terrifying for her.", "Why does she owe you money? Was there an agreement she pay her share? Or did you decide she owed you money because she broke up with you so you felt she needed to refund you for it?", "YTA\n\nYou can't demand payment after the fact. Unless you have a contact, you're just literally not entitled to the money.", "YTA", "It\u2019s been 2 months, leave her alone you\u2019re freaking her out. YTA.", "YTA\n\nWait wait wait, you made \"a couple of passive aggressive remarks\" because you were \"tired\" and she responded by breaking up with you as soon as you guys returned from your vacation and blocked you on everything? \n\nThen you're not bright enough to figure out when to take the L and move on like a big boy and come on here to gain sympathy because the math said you were right? Narcissist much?!?\n\nHow stupid do you think we all are with that flimsy ass story?  Your lack of self reflection and awareness coupled with your insistence to repeat the same stupid mistake in your shitty communication style leads me to conclude you are the very pinnacle of A-hole this sub was designed for.  \n\nI look forward to hearing more stories from you going forward since you sure as shit ain't figured out how shitty you are yet, keep going... Keep doubling down.\n\nThat was sarcasm.... For clarity sake, but I figured I'd need crayons to communicate that to you.", "YTA\n\nJust leave her alone, dude. Chalk up that $300 as a loss and move on with your life.", "YTA\n\nYou are stalking your ex. Leave her alone, get some therapy, and move on with your life, or you will (rightfully) face the legal consequences.", "Yta, definitely getting \u201cI\u2019m a nice guy\u201d vibes from this post", "YTA. Get a clue man. Leave her alone. Forget about the $300. You just wanted to interact with her.", "You went on the vacation too..? You\u2019re lucky she gave you any money at all. YTA", "YTA.\n\nShe gave you $300. You accepted $300.\n\nYou sound terrible. Leave her alone.", "YTA. You were harassing her so there was no need for quotes. She was done with putting up with your BS. I\u2019m guessing that you being \u2018a bit short\u2019 with her on vacation (with zero details as to what that entailed) meant that you made it a miserable time and she decided she was over it. Move on.", "Massive massive YTA lol you even have to ask??", "YTA \n\nYeah you were harassing her and deserved the cops called on you. \n\nYou accepted the money she gave you two months ago. That's the end of the story.", "YTA you accepted the first $300. Be grateful you were given that. Move on and cut your losses. Certainly don't go back begging for money 2 months later. You should have done the maths before you asked for any money, or before the trip. \n\nIf she gave you too much, I highly doubt you would have given it back to her.\n\nAs the OP you are writing this in the best light for you. I translate \"a bit short with her\" to you actually being a massive AH, so bad it was worth her instantly dumping you as soon as she was safely home.", "YTA.  It doesn't take two months to spend a few minutes on elementary school math.", "YTA. Stalker and a phyco. You need help", "YTA Ileft my winter coat and a nice pair of gloves in a girls car after a trip and then we broke up and they were never seen again. She offered to mail it or drop it off but never did. It\u2019s the way she goes\n\nI never went to her house. Take your losses", "YTA, what did you want the cops to do, arrest her for the money she owed you? Of course they don\u2019t care, that\u2019s not something they do, the correct course would be to take her to small claims court.", "2 months and all of sudden you \"remember\" what she \"owes\" you? I'm curious, what was the actual reason you decided to go over there?\n\nYTA btw", "YTA dude, like seriously violating your exs privacy without her consent.", "get therapy", "YTA.\n\nBruh. Cut your losses and move on before you end up with a restraining order. Two months later? Really man?", "YUP. OP decided that since GF broke up with him, he might as well make a bit of cash out of it. He tried and got F%$cked. YTA", "Bingo", "Am I the only one who gets \"nice guy\" vibes off OP's post?????? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA OP.  I can only imagine what your ex's side of the story with you is.  2 months later you do the math???  The hell you did.  You were practically stalking the poor woman.", "Accord and satisfaction, baby.", "That's coming. Op glossed over it but he said he \"was a bit short with her\" on vacation but gave no explanation. Considering how relevant that is to this story the fact that he didn't even try to mention what he said and did speaks volumes all by itself. Op was abusive. It was so bad that she immediately ran away and blocked him the moment they got back from an (apparently) expensive vacation together and she was safe from him in familiar territory. Notice she didn't even hint she wanted to break up with him while she was alone with him and vulnerable in a place she wasn't familiar with. Op is a danger to her and I wouldn't be the least surprised if she did get a RO before long.", "bornx tale lol", "[removed]", "I feel like there's a whole extended LOTR sized story we are missing about what happened on the trip.", "According to OP in a comment, he made some passive aggressive remarks at her that she took offense to.\n\nEdit: Autocorrect fucking up", "Yeah.. I can only imagine the Ex's side of the story..... OP is a \"nice guy\" freaking stalking her. How much you wanna bet he probably created multiple accounts on Social media and was trying to talk to her. \n\nan ex doesnt just randomly decide to never speak to their bf again for no reason.... its been building up and the vacation was the last straw.", "or a Russian sable hat", "Something more happened that was bigger that you're withholding. She cut you all the way off and didn't even want to open the door for you.", "Consider the 300 she allegedly owes the asshole tax.", "I'm tired of your bs, and I haven't had the displeasure of your actual presence. You owe me 300 dollars. I did the math, and that's what the wood in the gate said I should get because of reasons, insanity and I decided it to be so.", "Which is it? Were you rude and passive-aggressive, or did nothing happen?  YTA.  If you wanted the money, should have done before accepting that $300.  Leave her alone.", "\u201cPassive\u201d right. What kind of things did you say?", "such as?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Ya I don\u2019t believe him.", "I know you're just relaying the information he gave, but I'm having a *really* hard time believing the cops would get involved over some \"mild\" stalking (ie no threats that he's told us of) and \"passive aggressive remarks\". I mean there are too many women that end up brutalized/SA'd/murdered by stalkers because law enforcement didn't see them as a serious threat. She could have gotten lucky, of course, but I really don't believe it.", "trip had to be the last straw,,,,, I'm sure theres waaayyyy more to it than just \"being short\" on the trip.", "I meant that and edited it in, autocorrect fucked me up for whatever reason.", "Depends on where you live.  I just had the cops show up to the market I was shopping at because some worker said I was throwing up.  I literally came up with food poisoning and was at the market for 7/up and other things to make me feel better.  I threw up outside in the trash can on the way in.  Never been in trouble a day in my life but I had to get the 3rd degree for a good 10 minutes at least AND treated like a criminal before they left me alone.  Fucking bullshit.  You never know where cops have nothing better to do. They said they were there to see if I needed an ambulance lmao but ended up running my license to see if I have any warrants smh. Like arresting me would take my physical ailments away.  Bastards."]}
