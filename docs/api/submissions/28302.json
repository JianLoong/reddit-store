To give some context, her mum and I fucked up a lot during her childhood until we divorced with fights, trying to get her (and our son) to hate the other, etc, etc. After we divorced, I (and her mum) had to work more and was unable to spend much time for her, feeding into the resentment. She ended up going to her grandparents a lot and she basically views them more as her parents which I accept. She moved out of her mums and stop visiting me as soon as she turned 17 or 18 and she eventually moved to the US for work. I tried reaching out with casual phone and social media messages (like asking how she's doing, wishing happy birthday, congratulating her on promotions etc), which she either didn't reply too or replied basically. Eventually on a blog she set up, I learned her true feelings like feeling agitated about my messages and valuing her grandparents more and wishing I'd stop. I did and eventually on facebook, out of the blue, she sent me a youtube music video about someone leaving a failed relationship which I guess conveyed to me her feelings and I decided to close the book and accept full responsibility for fucking up. My daughter from the blog has gotten support and she's doing really well in the US.\n\nAnyway, with that context for my daughter's wedding which she is having in the US, I got not texts or any messages about her wanting me or her mum to come. I'd understand the guests probably are very limited between her friends in the US and family (and other friends) in the UK so I'm perfectly fine and understanding of not being invited.\n\nMy mum (her grandmother) though has different thoughts. She knows the relationship between me and her is basically non existent but not that we've basically both accepted that for the best. She confronted me (She and my dad and her other grandparents have been invited and have tickets). I explained I never got any invites and that guest numbers are gonna be limited. She thinks I could just book a ticket easily in the time frame. I tried to explain to her that I can't and it turned into a massive argument with her saying I'm not putting any effort in, don't deserve her etc. I explained to her why I think it's for the best and that I'd rather be at home with my dog than going thousands of miles for something I'd probably be barred from. This made her more angry until I told her to leave. She then other relatives including my sister who went completely at me in a phone call.\n\nI know I fucked up a lot and I expect the comments to be ruthless in that regard which I hope to be able to take. But in regard to the situation at hand, do you think I am in the right for respecting her wishes and wants for her wedding?", "created_utc": 1696538054, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/170sk7h/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_my_estranged/", "score": 165, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No.  Around, or during a wedding is never the time to deal with family drama of any kind.  She has enough stress right now.  Him showing up will only make it worse.  The last thing she needs is the emotional upheavel him showing up will cause, no matter the intentions.  Then you take it a step further by suggesting he ask her to let him give her away.  He did that when she was a child by using her as a pawn against her mother then abandoning her because of \"work\".  He lost the right to even consider walking her down the aisle long ago.\n\nOP, but NOT do any of what this person is suggesting.  You will cause even more harm.", "I don't know. I get what you're saying. Given the mistakes OP has made, a grand gesture of remorse seems warranted. But aside from the cost and logistics of a gesture like that, there's also the fact that, if it is not well received by OP's daughter, it has the potential to backfire, thereby destroying any possibility for reconciliation, and also ruining the daughter's wedding. If my estranged father showed up unannounced days before my wedding, I'd be pretty horrified and I would probably be preoccupied dealing with/worrying about that instead of being excited about getting married. It looks more like a self aggrandizing gesture than a genuine one. If it works out in OP's favor, he's the hero. And if his daughter rejects it, everyone will see the effort he put forth and he will still be the hero. None of this seems to take into account OP's daughter's desire. \n\nI think instead, if OP has any interest in reconciling this relationship and attending the wedding, he should reach out to his daughter and say that. Apologize for everything that warrants apology and offer that he will be there, if she will have him. And that even if she isn't ready for that (totally understandable), he will remain available, should she ever change her mind. This respects her boundaries if it's a no (and saves an awful lot of money and time) and it also is a genuine attempt that doesn't put the spotlight on OP, as the main character, flying across the world to try to salvage his broken relationship, right before one of the most important days of his daughter's life.", "She didn't.", "Have you ever acknowledged to your kid how much you fucked up without asking for anything in return?

Did he take accountability and sincerely apologize for being a negligent, crappy, no-effort parent or did he just send the occasional message and think that was enough?", "This was my response. OP, have you ever sat down and actually talked to your kids about this? Maybe, oh, I don\u2019t know, *apologized*?", "OP has done many many things wrong. The value of this cash gift is not one of them.", "He's long accepted that his daughter wants nothing to do with him. He's simply lying in the bed he made for himself. Now, yes, he could've apologized. Quite frankly, he should've. Whether it's accepted or not doesn't matter. He already blew the ample opportunities to be the father both his kids deserve, and he doesn't see a path forward with either. Maybe it was one final missed opportunity, but he didn't interpret it as an opportunity. It's unfortunate for the kids, really. To OP, respecting your daughter's wishes is the bare minimum that you can do. Even standing up to your clearly overbearing mother in order to do so. It's likely too little, too late to make up for being a shit father, but you did well in this particular instance.

Within 2 weeks of her wedding is neither of those.  It also shows her that yet again, he has no respect for her, and her wishes or feelings.  She has done well to tell him over the years she wants no contact.  The lack of invite to her wedding.  You know one of the biggest moments of her life was a clear indicator that he is nothing, and nobody to her.  At least he respects her that much to stay away from where he's not wanted.", "Agreed. It is one thing to admit that you were wrong it is another thing to sit down with the person that you wronged, apologize and take full accountability.

Seems like he's accepted the consequences of his actions those years ago and isn't an AH anymore to me.  Pushing her after knowing she doesn't want it would be AH behavior.", "This.", "I\u2019m not against cutting parents off when they\u2019re horrible. I also think it\u2019s never too late for a parent to admit they made mistakes and ask for forgiveness and a chance to fix things. It\u2019s up to her to accept it or not, but he needs to do that if he wants any chance at a relationship with her.", "He says her blog talked about being agitated by his messages\u2026could it be because NONE of those messages were taking accountability for his actions?", "But the time to do that is not by traveling to another continent to make her feel obligated to entertain him when she'll be focused on other things. He can send her a message or call if he wants to apologize that badly.", "She has said she doesn\u2019t want him to contact her. I don\u2019t know how else she can state this.\n\nTurning up at a wedding that you have not been invited to, in a different continent for someone who has repeatedly stated they do not want to hear from you is also not an appropriate way to apologise.\n\nThe best way to show that he respects her at this point is to listen to her.", "The traveling with the uncertainty of whether she\u2019ll allow him to be part of her day is called effort. No apology is complete without the effort. Imo", "I never said at the wedding.. I said well before and asking for forgiveness and permission to attend. You people just want to argue without even reading what I wrote!!!! \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "It\u2019s two weeks before the wedding. That is not well before.\n\nAnd the whole post is about him going to the wedding/ not going to the wedding.\n\nEven without the context of there being a wedding, turning up unannounced to a different continent to apologise to someone who doesn\u2019t want to speak to you is kind of aggressive and weird behaviour.\n\nAnd \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 PS Can I come to your wedding?\u201d would sound like he he\u2019s only apologising because he wants something."]}
