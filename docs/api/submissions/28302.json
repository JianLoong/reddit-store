To give some context, her mum and I fucked up a lot during her childhood until we divorced with fights, trying to get her (and our son) to hate the other, etc, etc. After we divorced, I (and her mum) had to work more and was unable to spend much time for her, feeding into the resentment. She ended up going to her grandparents a lot and she basically views them more as her parents which I accept. She moved out of her mums and stop visiting me as soon as she turned 17 or 18 and she eventually moved to the US for work. I tried reaching out with casual phone and social media messages (like asking how she's doing, wishing happy birthday, congratulating her on promotions etc), which she either didn't reply too or replied basically. Eventually on a blog she set up, I learned her true feelings like feeling agitated about my messages and valuing her grandparents more and wishing I'd stop. I did and eventually on facebook, out of the blue, she sent me a youtube music video about someone leaving a failed relationship which I guess conveyed to me her feelings and I decided to close the book and accept full responsibility for fucking up. My daughter from the blog has gotten support and she's doing really well in the US.\n\nAnyway, with that context for my daughter's wedding which she is having in the US, I got not texts or any messages about her wanting me or her mum to come. I'd understand the guests probably are very limited between her friends in the US and family (and other friends) in the UK so I'm perfectly fine and understanding of not being invited.\n\nMy mum (her grandmother) though has different thoughts. She knows the relationship between me and her is basically non existent but not that we've basically both accepted that for the best. She confronted me (She and my dad and her other grandparents have been invited and have tickets). I explained I never got any invites and that guest numbers are gonna be limited. She thinks I could just book a ticket easily in the time frame. I tried to explain to her that I can't and it turned into a massive argument with her saying I'm not putting any effort in, don't deserve her etc. I explained to her why I think it's for the best and that I'd rather be at home with my dog than going thousands of miles for something I'd probably be barred from. This made her more angry until I told her to leave. She then other relatives including my sister who went completely at me in a phone call.\n\nI know I fucked up a lot and I expect the comments to be ruthless in that regard which I hope to be able to take. But in regard to the situation at hand, do you think I am in the right for respecting her wishes and wants for her wedding?", "created_utc": 1696538054, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/170sk7h/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_my_estranged/", "score": 939, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No.  Around, or during a wedding is never the time to deal with family drama of any kind.  She has enough stress right now.  Him showing up will only make it worse.  The last thing she needs is the emotional upheavel him showing up will cause, no matter the intentions.  Then you take it a step further by suggesting he ask her to let him give her away.  He did that when she was a child by using her as a pawn against her mother then abandoning her because of \"work\".  He lost the right to even consider walking her down the aisle long ago.\n\nOP, but NOT do any of what this person is suggesting.  You will cause even more harm.", "I don't know. I get what you're saying. Given the mistakes OP has made, a grand gesture of remorse seems warranted. But aside from the cost and logistics of a gesture like that, there's also the fact that, if it is not well received by OP's daughter, it has the potential to backfire, thereby destroying any possibility for reconciliation, and also ruining the daughter's wedding. If my estranged father showed up unannounced days before my wedding, I'd be pretty horrified and I would probably be preoccupied dealing with/worrying about that instead of being excited about getting married. It looks more like a self aggrandizing gesture than a genuine one. If it works out in OP's favor, he's the hero. And if his daughter rejects it, everyone will see the effort he put forth and he will still be the hero. None of this seems to take into account OP's daughter's desire. \n\nI think instead, if OP has any interest in reconciling this relationship and attending the wedding, he should reach out to his daughter and say that. Apologize for everything that warrants apology and offer that he will be there, if she will have him. And that even if she isn't ready for that (totally understandable), he will remain available, should she ever change her mind. This respects her boundaries if it's a no (and saves an awful lot of money and time) and it also is a genuine attempt that doesn't put the spotlight on OP, as the main character, flying across the world to try to salvage his broken relationship, right before one of the most important days of his daughter's life.", "She didn't.", "Have you ever acknowledged to your kid how much you fucked up without asking for anything in return?

Did he take accountability and sincerely apologize for being a negligent, crappy, no-effort parent or did he just send the occasional message and think that was enough?", "This was my response. OP, have you ever sat down and actually talked to your kids about this? Maybe, oh, I don\u2019t know, *apologized*?", "OP has done many many things wrong. The value of this cash gift is not one of them.", "He's long accepted that his daughter wants nothing to do with him. He's simply lying in the bed he made for himself. Now, yes, he could've apologized. Quite frankly, he should've. Whether it's accepted or not doesn't matter. He already blew the ample opportunities to be the father both his kids deserve, and he doesn't see a path forward with either. Maybe it was one final missed opportunity, but he didn't interpret it as an opportunity. It's unfortunate for the kids, really. To OP, respecting your daughter's wishes is the bare minimum that you can do. Even standing up to your clearly overbearing mother in order to do so. It's likely too little, too late to make up for being a shit father, but you did well in this particular instance.

Within 2 weeks of her wedding is neither of those.  It also shows her that yet again, he has no respect for her, and her wishes or feelings.  She has done well to tell him over the years she wants no contact.  The lack of invite to her wedding.  You know one of the biggest moments of her life was a clear indicator that he is nothing, and nobody to her.  At least he respects her that much to stay away from where he's not wanted.", "Agreed. It is one thing to admit that you were wrong it is another thing to sit down with the person that you wronged, apologize and take full accountability.

I feel like OP falls in the second category and he\u2019s right for letting her have her day without bringing baggage into it or expecting her to be responsible for his feelings.", "This is very true! Just out of curiosity, how would you react if someone apologized over text? I'm realizing I'm kinda similar", "Yeah, from what's been said, it sounds like the daughter has made her feelings clear on her blog and he's trying to respect that and not cause her any more upset. NTA", "Exactly. So well said.", "Daughter may not want to hear though.\n\nI'm in a position much like OP's daughter. My parents screwed up monumentally during my childhood and went AWOL on an emotional and social level in my late teens. I don't talk to them either and haven't for a very long time. Personally I don't want to hear something like this from them because I don't want to hear from them at all. They're my past, they were shit, but that's how it is sometimes. I've made my peace with it, moved on and have a by and large good life. I am not interested in reopening those wounds by having to interact with them at all, including over text. It's the past, it should stay there.", "So your solution is for OP to disregard and disrespect her wishes and to keep contacting her?\n\n\\*Chasing someone\\* \"I JUST WANT TO APOLOGIZE, WHY WON'T YOU LET ME APOLOGIZE AND LET ME LOVE YOU?!\" is what you're saying he should do?\n\nNot everyone wants an apology, some people just want to move on.", "I'd imagine the guy who read the actual blog knows a little more about the contents of said blog than someone who didn't know it existed until they read a character-limited AITA post.", "I\u2019m saying instead of just reaching out with shallow platitudes that he say something like, \u201cHey, I just want to acknowledge that the way I treated you your entire life was really fucked up and I can completely understand why you\u2019re angry and hurt. I apologize for the hurt that my actions have caused you and, if you want to, I would like to try having a relationship with you because you\u2019re my daughter and I love you.\u201d\n\nThis is something I wish my own father could pull his head out of his own ass to say to all three of his children.", "Honestly the only way OP and ex daughter has a chance with reconciliation is with a letter. OP gets it off his chest, but gives the ex daughter the option to respond or not.\n\nSit down meetings will not work here. It's too far gone for that.", "He will ruin her wedding if he does this. Not only would it cause extreme emotional distress to her immediately before her wedding, she couldn\u2019t even trust his motivations. \n\nIf he\u2019s going to reach out, which I\u2019m not even sure he should, it should be WELL after the wedding. Like a few weeks. Let her celebrate in peace.", ">This is something I wish my own father could pull his head out of his own ass to say to all three of his children.\n\nAnd that's the problem.  ***You*** want that, it's pretty clear OP's daughter does not.  Stop pushing your desires and judge based on the merits of the evidence provided.", "Don\u2019t hold your breath. My father remained the child until he died. Alone.", "Why doesn't daughter get the option of not hearing from him? Like why must she have an apology from him that by the sound of it she doesn't want to hear?\n\nFrankly OP is a better person than you because he can accept he messed up so massively that his kid doesn't want to hear from him.", "And you saying that OPs daughter *doesn\u2019t* want this is the same thing. Nowhere in the original post does OP say that daughter has come out and said she wants nothing to do with him.", "Yeah, I\u2019m not waiting with bated breath, that\u2019s for sure. I think for me, what\u2019s more frustrating is the other family members of his generation who constantly commiserate with me, but have NEVER thought of opening their damn mouths to him.", "Daughter has the option of not reading or opening the letter. She could go one step further and burn it. A letter can be trashed,  an in person apology doesn't allow that flexibility. \n\nIt's giving OP peace without actual peace....read between the lines buttercup!"]}
