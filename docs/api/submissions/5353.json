On her, I usually gift her something at Christmas, like her next grade of music book, rosin and a gift card from the local luthier to get a new bow and have her instrument serviced but having not had time to list my old cello for sale or even know where to, my good deed strings got plucked at thinking that my old instrument would likely mean the world to someone like Chloe who's parents will likely never afford a decent instrument for her but stupid me, mentioned this idea to my sister-in-law Gale, who has a daughter (14F) We'll call her Alice, and she told me that Alice wants to learn the cello and insisted that I give the instrument to her daughter instead as it's \"too valuable to give to a stranger's kid\"\n\nAlice is her own little dude and we get along quite well but she has never mentioned wanting to learn an instrument to me until she watched Wednesday and now \"it's cool\" all of a sudden.\n\nAlice, hasn't stuck with anything for long, she follows fads and jumps from one thing to another and is for lack of a better word spoilt and based on her track record, handing her anything other than a student cello as her first instrument would be a waste as I'm unable to convince myself that she would even practise let alone reach a point that would call for this level of instrument, where Chloe is at a point where yes this instrument is slightly too big for her right now but she needs it and call me what you'd like for this part but I'd feel happier about giving it away to someone that needs it like Chloe rather than someone that just wants it but is connected to me, you know? But that has me worried that I might be seen as an ahole on this decision, family first?\n\nThe music school is putting on Christmas carols tonight and I intend to gift the cello to Chloe at the end but I'm still conflicted about it.\n\nEDIT: Update is in this thread, thank you to everyone for taking time to respond", "created_utc": 1671695313, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zsg5gi/wibta_for_giving_my_old_cello_to_a_fellow_student/", "score": 1872, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think it\u2019s kind of presumptuous of your SIL to demand you give the instrument to your niece.", "NTA at all. Your SIL is just being a grabbyhands.", "NTA\n\nYou want that cello to be used, played and loved and Chloe will do that\n\nI ended up giving my daughter's old harp to a little girl who was learning, sure I could have sold it - but I'd rather someone use it who wouldn't get the chance to otherwise", "What did you end up doing? I support giving it to Chloe.", "NTA. It's yours and you can do with it what you wish.\n\nIf you're well off, and a student cello is within your Christmas budget, give Alice an instrument appropriate for her.\n\nYour SIL is the only AH here.

Go with you\u2019re original plan.", "I'd never demand that my sibling just give my kid a $9000 Cello.  It's yours, you paid for it so give it to Chloe.  Better that then giving it to someone who may not enjoy it and have it collect dust in the corner of their room like my daughters Cello.", "Omg you\u2019re NTA at all!! Give it to Chloe! I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll appreciate it forever. She\u2019s clearly passionate and you know it\u2019ll be put to good use. I hope the performance at the music school goes well!!", "Definitely Chloe - and does the point about the value lead anyone else to think that sister in law is anticipating a 4k windfall more than an instrument for her daughter?", "Nta-  team Chloe getting the cello!", "NTA, you know that with Chloe your old cello woud be loved and practiced. For musician is giving an old trusty instrument is like give away trusty old friend. You don't want your friend to be treated badly and forgotten in his case after your nice find out that learning instrument is hard work.", "NTA. Tell your sister you decided to sell it, and then give it to Chloe.", "NTA, you decide where your posessions go.", "NTA and you are going to make someones Christmas very very special. That cello would mean the world for her and her family as opposed to it gathering dust in a few months time. Go for it and make the little girls world a lot brighter as someday she might turn out to be one of the best performers in the world and your cello would always be that special thing she would hold onto. It would be her inspiration and I am sure it would be spotless and put to good use. Your SIL has the mentality that it has to stay in the family and someday it would probably get sold than being put to good use. If her daughter wants to learn the cello, she can always start with something cheaper and unless one is dedicated and really into it, it would be a waste for something you consider valuable. \n\nTrust me, the look on Chloe's face would be priceless when you gift her the cello and its worth every fight you may have to get into for the rest of your life regarding this.

It's too valuable to give to a someone who can't and very likely won't use it either. Then what? Sis-in-law sells it to finance the next trend her daughter wants to try? If you feel some family obligation gift your niece some music lessons.\n\n**Besides, Chloe isn't stranger to you**. She would actually benefit from this. \n\nAnd in future... maybe keep your private matters private. You've seen now first hand how some people can see you sharing some info as an invitation to start meddling.", "Just popped in to say Team Chloe. Music can be a life changer and Chloe has the passion and drive already. To take such care of something like an instrument and be so dedicated at that age is amazing and she would not only benefit from it in playing but also emotionally. You are an amazing person.", "I think that Chloe deserves it more and Her Parent's would be grateful for Your Help", "NTA - I would give it to Chloe... Just because you know she takes her music seriously and will actually take care of the cello.", "\"I'm terribly sorry, I've given you the wrong impression. Chloe isn't 'some stranger's kid,' she's a girl I've been mentoring for years. And you are correct that it is valuable...too valuable to give to a beginner. But I'll tell you what, if you decide to rent a cello for Alice, I'll give her some lessons so she can decide if she's really interested in learning it long-term\"\n\n(Last sentence can be replaced by any suggestions you have about how Alice might start learning the cello that don't involve you giving her an expensive item that she is unlikely to appreciate. It's optional, but a good way to shift the conversation from your actions to a practical plan of action)\n\nNTA. Your SIL decided to interpret your extremely kind-hearted gesture towards a promising girl with limited means as a \"free stuff up for grabs\" sign. This was never a choice between Chloe and Alice, it was a choice between Chloe and selling it to a stranger.\n\nThe other thing that neither she nor Alice seems to understand is that learning an instrument is much more than thinking it sounds cool and getting something for free. It's a *huge* investment of time and money. That's why, even if you want to help out your niece, you need the 2 of them to demonstrate that they have some skin in the game.", "NTA - it is beyond kind of you to give your cello to a girl in need who will love it!! Definitely give it to her! It is incredibly rude of your SIL to ask for the cello! Instead of giving Alice the cello, if her mother buys her a student cello maybe you can teach her a few lessons. Or some other compromise. But you definitely don\u2019t need to give her the cello.", "NTA\u2014 I agree it\u2019s out of line for Gale to demand it. \n\nBut please make sure you CYA giving Chloe the cello. You don\u2019t want this interest in and gifts to a child to be taken the wrong way. Ask her parents first, etc.", "NTA..... I think giving the cello to Chloe is the best option here. She has worked so hard to get where she is and you can relate. Your niece however I feel will pick it up once or twice and it will collect dust after that.", "NTA\n\nThe cost of your cello sounds rather like it is not really a beginner's instrument.  To be honest, even if it was a beginner instrument, gifting this cello to someone who plays and loves the cello is a much better use of the instrument than someone who thinks they might like to learn it, but may just stick it in the corner of her room and not take care of it.\n\nPerhaps a suggestion to your SIL that you could help her find a beginner instrument for Alice. And when I say help, I don't specifically mean pay for it, but provide advice and guidance so they can get the best possible instrument to suit her needs.  \n\nLastly it is your cello to do with what you will. You don't have to give it to someone because they are family, I'm sure she wouldn't be interested in it if you were selling it. SIL is just being grabby.", "Not sure how I feel about you \"pitying\" Chloe, but NTA. Hobbies picked up because of a TV show that's going to run its course is not the best way to show you're interested. Not only that, but Chloe has been a student learning the cello for far longer and would actually appreciate the cello, even if she'll have to grow into it. No offence, just an observation, but you sound kinda condescending with the way you describe Chloe and her family's financial situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Chloe's father finally responded and told me that they couldn't accept it as Chloe had pointed out an instrument of equal value to mine to them while they were in the shop and he didn't feel it was right to take it for anything but a fair value and that they couldn't afford to do that. \n\nI'll admit that I felt a little bit annoyed by his initial good mannered refusal but I understood it as I was raised by similar minded parents with the same values but I told her parents that it was an offer that I felt that they really couldn't pass up as it was something that I felt Chloe had earned and needed desperately and that even if they didn't accept my offer I was going to give it to Chloe anyway and I turned and placed the hard case in front of the shocked and dead silent Chloe and walked away.\n\nChloe's father approached me while we were helping pack up the entertainment hall and he gave me a hug and thanked me, promising to drop off the money at my shop in the morning and offering to help me out if ever I needed anything, for a stubborn bloke like that to be as red and teary as he was makes me sure that I did the right thing in making him accept the cello like I did. \n\nChloe was visibly quite emotional but trying not to show it but she broke down after mouthing thank you to me as everyone was leaving and I found it extremely hard to keep my composure and could only manage a smile and a thumbs up in return.\n\nI think I'm going to be riding this high for a good while.\n\nThe best thing is I can tell Gale that I sold it without having to lie and I can toss up the idea of using the money Chloe's dad pays me for the cello to buy a reasonable second hand learner's instrument for Alice.\n\nAgain thank you to for the responses and advice.", "Honestly?

The point of this is to give your in-laws an idea of the real cost of such activities as well as give your niece an idea of how much work it is to learn how to play.\n\nI would recommend that you maintain this agreement with Chloe, with her doing stuff like helping maintain instruments and researching songs or participating in practice sessions together as her \u2018payment\u2019 instead of cash.

It is exactly what I needed today.", "I\u2019m not crying, you\u2019re crying \ud83d\ude2d", "NTA. Alice doesn't want the cello, Alice's mom wants to sell the cello.", "I'm so glad she got it!  I didn't have much when I was listen but played music on junk and practiced hours a day.  Something like this would've made my whole world.", "Damn you, I got teary. Awesome story. Happy Holidays to you.", "This is the best update ever!!", "You just restored my Xmas spirit.", "You made this music teacher cry today. Thank you for giving the gift of music to a truly deserving student :)", "You are a wonderful and generous person. Wish there were more ppl like you. Merry Christmas \ud83c\udf84 and a Happy New Year", "> I can toss up the idea of using the money Chloe's dad pays me for the cello to buy a reasonable second hand learner's instrument for Alice\n\nI presume Chloe has her old cello. If she doesn't want it for a younger sibling, that might make the Dad feel a bit better.", "\u2764\ufe0f", "What a sweet and special person you are. And Chloe is very blessed to have her parents and friends like you in her life. Have a wonderful holiday season and Happy New year", "A half cello is really too small for a teenager though, it\u2019s the size I played from 8 to about 11. It might not fit Alice; also Chloe\u2019s parents might want to sell it themselves.", "For sure.", "Aw thank you! I appreciate it :).\n\nIs there any way I can pass this award forward to OP?", "Y\u2019all too kind. Is there a way I can pass it forward to OP?", "If you're lucky, you can find some decent instruments at pawn shops, too. I'd take someone who's familiar with the type of instrument to give it a once-over.  They need to check for movement issues in slides/keys/whatever, check for sound capability, and any structural issues (missing cork, solder, pads, keys, springs, etc).\n\nI haven't looked in a long time, but I've bought a cornet (good condition) and a French horn (beat to hell bell, but perfect pitch). \n\nAlso, I'd check the local online marketplaces for the hand-me-down instruments that students have fizzled out on or upgraded from.", "I don't think so, but I did give OP a platinum and you a hugz award :)", "I have to read this again. My heart is so full from reading this whole story.", "Thank you. You're a good person. \n\nIt's very probable you changed this girls life, and I'm sure she will always remember what you did.", "NTA", "NTA if gale wants Alice to have a cello than she should buy her daughter one herself. Im rooting that you give it to chloe. She works hard and deserves it and it would like you would be happier and more comfortableto give it to chloe. Alice sounds like she gets everything she wants and would t value it while Chloe would cherish it for the rest of her life.", "I'm glad you gave it to Chloe....when I played an instrument we couldn't afford one, I had to play the beat-up old one from the school. While I was good, it kept me from auditioning for the very prominent youth orchestra my teacher thought I was good enough to be in because I was embarrassed about my beat up old instrument. I hope both you and her go far!!!!", "This will be a special moment for her the rest of her life.\n\nGood job you", "Amazing story, thank you for that this Christmas.  You did well.\n\nI bet Gale would have sold it. Chloe is gonna play the shit out of it.  That\u2019s how you know it is in the right home.", "Excellent, and as a professional string player who needed help/patronage as a child getting instruments: thanks.", "It turned out perfectly.", "Ooo this pulled at my heart strings\n\nU are one great person OP, I wish i could give u a hug and a gold medal \ud83c\udfc5  \n\nMy family was raised a lot like yours and Chloe and we have been blessed by a few random strangers over the years. I can't even begin to tell u the impact this has made on me and my siblings future. U are amazing \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "This brightened my day, thank you for sharing your story with us", "Nah, get her a year's rental and lessons. If she sticks at it, you can talk about buying an instrument next year.", "No idea but I sent them some as well", "Welcome to Reddit! You have a good heart, and a good start on your karma ;) If I were you, I'd keep this account, and head on over to r/cello so that you can chat with likeminded people and have fun! \n\nI am not a cellist, but a trombonist, and have a lot of fun in the bone subreddit spreading my knowledge, and learning from others, and am happy for you that you are finally able to enjoy the wonders of creating music, and am able to share this journey with your fellow musician. You not only have a friendship with this young woman, but now have gained a lifetime friendship with an entire family because of your actions. Never stop, music is so rewarding and fun, and I count my blessings all the time that I'm still able to play with my university even as part of the staff now...", "You\u2019re very kind, thank you", "NTA:  \"The best thing is I can tell Gale that I sold it without having to lie and I can toss up the idea of using the money Chloe's dad pays me for the cello to buy a reasonable second hand learner's instrument for Alice.\"\n\nIf I were religious, I would say God's hands were involved in giving you on the spot wisdom to solve your conflict without lying, helping someone in need, and not hurting your niece's feelings.", ">Alice, hasn't stuck with anything for long, she follows fads and jumps from one thing to another\n\nFyi, that's a classic trait among people with ADHD.  There are jokes on ADHD forums about having \"hobby swaps\" where someone can trade their musical instrument for knitting needles and way to much yarn, etc.   Only 25% of kids with ADHD have physical hyperactivity, and many do very well in school. So even if Alice doesn't fit what you think you know about the condition it might be worth spending a little time reading up on it and then talking to your sister if it seems like Alice may have it but not yet be diagnosed.  Simply knowing why one's brain works the way it does helps so much!  And there are options for skills coaching and for treatment if they choose.\n\n\nThank you for posting your story and for giving such an incredible gift to Chloe.  You are a wonderful person!", "YTA for making me ugly cry right before Christmas, you generous, kind-hearted, thoughtful, jerk.  You probably play excellent cello too. Damn you for adding to my faith in humanity!!", "This is such a beautiful Christmas story. Pardon me while I try to find some tissues.", "I have a problem with the SIL insisting you give *your* property to her daughter who has not shown one sign of wanting to learn cello. OP I think the instrument would be well loved and well used by Chloe.\n\nNTA", "You\u2019re beautiful OP, yes I know you\u2019re a man. It felt good didn\u2019t it.

Wonderful outcome!  Well done....Merry Christmas!", "No, I'm not crying! My eyes are just wet and leaking", "Thank you for this wonderful update!!  This time, my tears were from happiness.
