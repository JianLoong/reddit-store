I think it\u2019s kind of presumptuous of your SIL to demand you give the instrument to your niece.", "NTA at all. Your SIL is just being a grabbyhands.", "NTA\n\nYou want that cello to be used, played and loved and Chloe will do that\n\nI ended up giving my daughter's old harp to a little girl who was learning, sure I could have sold it - but I'd rather someone use it who wouldn't get the chance to otherwise", "What did you end up doing? I support giving it to Chloe.", "NTA. It's yours and you can do with it what you wish.\n\nIf you're well off, and a student cello is within your Christmas budget, give Alice an instrument appropriate for her.\n\nYour SIL is the only AH here.

Go with you\u2019re original plan.", "I'd never demand that my sibling just give my kid a $9000 Cello.  It's yours, you paid for it so give it to Chloe.  Better that then giving it to someone who may not enjoy it and have it collect dust in the corner of their room like my daughters Cello.", "Omg you\u2019re NTA at all!! Give it to Chloe! I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll appreciate it forever. She\u2019s clearly passionate and you know it\u2019ll be put to good use. I hope the performance at the music school goes well!!", "Definitely Chloe - and does the point about the value lead anyone else to think that sister in law is anticipating a 4k windfall more than an instrument for her daughter?", "Nta-  team Chloe getting the cello!", "NTA, you know that with Chloe your old cello woud be loved and practiced. For musician is giving an old trusty instrument is like give away trusty old friend. You don't want your friend to be treated badly and forgotten in his case after your nice find out that learning instrument is hard work.", "NTA.

That cello would mean the world for her and her family as opposed to it gathering dust in a few months time. Go for it and make the little girls world a lot brighter as someday she might turn out to be one of the best performers in the world and your cello would always be that special thing she would hold onto. It would be her inspiration and I am sure it would be spotless and put to good use. Your SIL has the mentality that it has to stay in the family and someday it would probably get sold than being put to good use. If her daughter wants to learn the cello, she can always start with something cheaper and unless one is dedicated and really into it, it would be a waste for something you consider valuable. \n\nTrust me, the look on Chloe's face would be priceless when you gift her the cello and its worth every fight you may have to get into for the rest of your life regarding this.

It's too valuable to give to a someone who can't and very likely won't use it either. Then what? Sis-in-law sells it to finance the next trend her daughter wants to try? If you feel some family obligation gift your niece some music lessons.\n\n**Besides, Chloe isn't stranger to you**. She would actually benefit from this. \n\nAnd in future... maybe keep your private matters private. You've seen now first hand how some people can see you sharing some info as an invitation to start meddling.", "Just popped in to say Team Chloe. Music can be a life changer and Chloe has the passion and drive already. To take such care of something like an instrument and be so dedicated at that age is amazing and she would not only benefit from it in playing but also emotionally. You are an amazing person.", "I think that Chloe deserves it more and Her Parent's would be grateful for Your Help", "NTA - I would give it to Chloe... Just because you know she takes her music seriously and will actually take care of the cello.", "\"I'm terribly sorry, I've given you the wrong impression. Chloe isn't 'some stranger's kid,' she's a girl I've been mentoring for years. And you are correct that it is valuable...too valuable to give to a beginner.

It's optional, but a good way to shift the conversation from your actions to a practical plan of action)\n\nNTA. Your SIL decided to interpret your extremely kind-hearted gesture towards a promising girl with limited means as a \"free stuff up for grabs\" sign. This was never a choice between Chloe and Alice, it was a choice between Chloe and selling it to a stranger.\n\nThe other thing that neither she nor Alice seems to understand is that learning an instrument is much more than thinking it sounds cool and getting something for free. It's a *huge* investment of time and money. That's why, even if you want to help out your niece, you need the 2 of them to demonstrate that they have some skin in the game.", "NTA - it is beyond kind of you to give your cello to a girl in need who will love it!! Definitely give it to her! It is incredibly rude of your SIL to ask for the cello! Instead of giving Alice the cello, if her mother buys her a student cello maybe you can teach her a few lessons. Or some other compromise. But you definitely don\u2019t need to give her the cello.", "NTA\u2014 I agree it\u2019s out of line for Gale to demand it. \n\nBut please make sure you CYA giving Chloe the cello. You don\u2019t want this interest in and gifts to a child to be taken the wrong way. Ask her parents first, etc.", "NTA..... I think giving the cello to Chloe is the best option here. She has worked so hard to get where she is and you can relate. Your niece however I feel will pick it up once or twice and it will collect dust after that.", "NTA\n\nThe cost of your cello sounds rather like it is not really a beginner's instrument.  To be honest, even if it was a beginner instrument, gifting this cello to someone who plays and loves the cello is a much better use of the instrument than someone who thinks they might like to learn it, but may just stick it in the corner of her room and not take care of it.\n\nPerhaps a suggestion to your SIL that you could help her find a beginner instrument for Alice. And when I say help, I don't specifically mean pay for it, but provide advice and guidance so they can get the best possible instrument to suit her needs.  \n\nLastly it is your cello to do with what you will. You don't have to give it to someone because they are family, I'm sure she wouldn't be interested in it if you were selling it. SIL is just being grabby.", "Not sure how I feel about you \"pitying\" Chloe, but NTA. Hobbies picked up because of a TV show that's going to run its course is not the best way to show you're interested. Not only that, but Chloe has been a student learning the cello for far longer and would actually appreciate the cello, even if she'll have to grow into it. No offence, just an observation, but you sound kinda condescending with the way you describe Chloe and her family's financial situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I vote for Chloe. Your niece and SIL can surely afford a student cello.", "Tell her you decided to sell it instead.
