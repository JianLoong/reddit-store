It also sounds like your stepmom is just being lazy and not want to work (  His wife (51) does not work and has been denied disability many times). she probably use to staying home and now that your dad cant work is more then willing for someone else to pick up the bill. I grew up in a house that had a mom like you. every extra penny when to her family - her junkie brothers and mother mooched off what little we had for years. it got to the point my dad hated my mom because of it.

It can take up to a few months to get approved however it really isn't as difficult as many say if you actually qualify, depending on their income, quality of life and mobility will effect how much they may receive each month. However being married will actually lower the amount you can receive as they'll veiw them as one person/unit and merge then cut what they could receive. Offer to drive them to the social security office or doctor appointments in order to get their documents in order but pull back on how much you're spending on them.

Like, no one except a court can force you to pay, so at some point you made the choice to take over their bills. You don\u2019t mention if your Dad screamed/bullied/guilted you into it, which you should identify if he did, as otherwise it sounds like you volunteered/offered. If you volunteered, or worse offered without being even asked for support, then you don\u2019t get around and present yourself as a martyr about it. Did you even tell him how tight things are for you and you would appreciate if they come into any money for them to pay their own bills first? sorry, but if they get money as a gift, often people (not all, of course) in that situation will use it to buy something nice/fun if their necessities are already being covered as they realize they won\u2019t have that ability again for a while to buy something fun/want. Like if they found $20 on the street they\u2019ll buy take out.

If it wasn't ear-marked for some specific purpose.\n\nHere's the other variable.  What was the money for?  Let's say the giver knew their car was having problems and they needed $500 to fix it.  So the giver gives them $500 for Christmas, telling them that he wants the money to go toward fixing their car.  Then I'd say NAH, as the parents would be spending the money as directed by the giver.\n\n(in that case, it would have been more helpful for the giver to just gift cash, with no stated purpose for the cash...but your parents do not control how the giver spends their money)\n\nIf they got say $300 or more and the giver did not include instructions on what specific purpose was intended for the money, then I'd say NTA.\n\nBut here's the problem.
