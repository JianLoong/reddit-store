Now that you know how it's going to be, adjust accordingly. They are in survival mode. Use your money on your family, set a monthly budget for helping him and don't go over it. Take them to the food bank, connect to services, ask their insurance if Ride-to-Care is available, do things that won't take the food off your table. Do things that won't lead to resentment. Don't be too hard on them, they're in survival mode and have been for some time. They're holding on to the little they have.", "NTA Stop paying their bills. Tell them they need to figure it out. You are cash strapped.", "NTA but keep in mind you can - and should - back away from the level of support you've been giving them. You are giving more than you have. It sounds like you've been very selfless but have really gone too far with it. You aren't their only lifeline and they aren't your responsibility. Of course you should share what you can but not to the point you're putting your own household at risk. So I don't blame you for wanting it to change but you have FULL control to stop or to do less, and that's exactly what you should do effective immediately.", "NTA - This is not about whether you should support your parents. This is not about whether they took advantage of you (though they did). The very simple fact is that you cannot afford to financially support your parents. So you need to stop doing that. \n\nTell them that you can help them apply for services, but that the financial support is at an end. Don't make it a judgement call about their behavior, that just leaves the door open for arguments. This is just about the fact that you do not have money in your budget to support them. \n\n\"We cannot afford to feed and house our children and also support you. I am sure you understand that we need to prioritize our children.\"\n\nIf they try to argue against that, it tells you all you need to know.", "No, NTA.  They are.  It is great that you have been helping, but if she has been denied disability, she can go work.  The fact that you can't take care of yourselves any more, no.  NTA and you should stop.  Someone else can help.", "NTA\n\n> My husband (40) and myself (37) have been paying their bills for them\n\n*Why?*\n\nI'm sorry, but adults can take care of their own damn selves.", "NTA. I understand helping but they should have helped too when receiving the money for Christmas.", "Why are you supporting them instead of taking care of your family and kids first?\n\nNTA", "ESH. They are taking advantage, yes, but you're the one letting them. Maybe you should be prioritizing your own children over your father, especially now that you know they haven't looked out for you similarly this month. Stop helping them when you can't afford it. \n\nYou can't save someone from drowning if you're going under water yourself.", "NTA  \n\n\nSocial services exist for people like this.  I'd be making a list of potential organizations who can help, organizing it and offering to sit down and help them make calls and fill out  forms.  Your tax dollars are paying for these services.    \n\n\nAs others have suggested, make a budget for your household and stick to it.   Endangering your own financial stability in order to help them could sink both of your families.", "YTA stop enabling them. Their bills are their responsibility. Your responsibility is to your house and your children. Let them know you will no longer be paying their bills so they need to get jobs. IDGAF if your dad has a medical condition, that\u2019s his wife\u2019s responsibility. Changed from not the AH bc the more I think about it, the more it piss a me off that you are putting your children\u2019s security at risk for some adults that you have no financial obligation to. If you were a multi-millionaire and this didn\u2019t touch your kids and spouse, okay not an AH, but yeah putting daddy and his wife before your kids? You know you\u2019re wrong for that.", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t raise the cash, though. Just tell them that having to take out a loan to buy your own essentials has made you realise you can no longer afford to support them. Any argument, any objections, just keep saying \u2018we can\u2019t afford to feed our children\u2019. No further explanation, no arguing. End of conversation.", "YTA - I know most here say your not but you are\n\nwow - this post brought up a lot of bad memory's of when  I was a kid.  you need to stop giving your parents money.  Your family is suffering because of your dad and his wife (stepmom?). It also sounds like your stepmom is just being lazy and not want to work (  His wife (51) does not work and has been denied disability many times). she probably use to staying home and now that your dad cant work is more then willing for someone else to pick up the bill. I grew up in a house that had a mom like you. every extra penny when to her family - her junkie brothers and mother mooched off what little we had for years. it got to the point my dad hated my mom because of it. I hated my mom because of it.  Dont put your own family (husband and children) second or you will lose in the end.", "NTA. Stop giving them money.", "NTA\n\nYou should not be helping out more than you can financially afford.\n\nThat means... don't give them money you don't have! You should not have to be borrowing money to pay your own bills because you are also paying someone else's. This means you cannot afford to assist them, and so you shouldn't. \n\nYour parents will have to figure out something else. They are still independent adults, and so the responsibility to save money was theirs. The responsibility to ensure their bills are still paid... are theirs. Etc.", "NTA. I would also advise your FIL to hire a disability lawyer to expedite the process. Their fee is a portion of what he gets retroactively, and if he loses, they don\u2019t charge anything. My ex was turned down twice even though he has epilepsy, and could no longer work. After the 2nd time, he got a disability lawyer, and won his case. From the time he first applied to the the time he won took him over 3 years. If he doesn\u2019t get a lawyer, you could be waiting a few more years.", "Absolutely you should ask them for money and do it NOW before they spend it.  Next time they need help ask them what they did with the unexpected cash they got then tell them you are tapped out.  You are responsible for your immediate family first not your parents before your partner and kids.", "YTA for giving them money you didn\u2019t have then complaining about it. And for giving money when the wife doesn\u2019t work but chooses not to. Stop giving them money.", "NTA.", "Nope \nHonestly your dad should be ashamed of himself. Keep the receipts because SSI/SSA gives then a big pay out get your reimbursement", "Don\u2019t tell them they\u2019re taking advantage, tell them you\u2019re DONE. They will have to figure it out with whatever social services are available to people in their position. Do not keep jeopardizing your family\u2019s finances to solve their problems. Also they\u2019re in their 50s, not their 90s.", "NTA his wife needs to get a job. If she has been denied disability multiple times, she isnt disabled. It took me three months from application to the first check for me. If they are both unemployed they should be getitng some help from the state. not a lot but some. They can also move into subsidized housing. They are going toi have to anyway because disability pays only $1000 a month. They will be living in poverty.", "Stop. You have your own family to support.", "NTA! All of what the others have said and then a bit from me, a disabled individual on disability and SSI. It can take up to a few months to get approved however it really isn't as difficult as many say if you actually qualify, depending on their income, quality of life and mobility will effect how much they may receive each month. However being married will actually lower the amount you can receive as they'll veiw them as one person/unit and merge then cut what they could receive. Offer to drive them to the social security office or doctor appointments in order to get their documents in order but pull back on how much you're spending on them. If they complain tell them they can always move into a state provided care home instead if it's really that big of an issue because you've already gone above and beyond with your three children at home you that have to feed and house with money you don't have because of them taking advantage of your generosity.", "NTA rather than taking advantage of you, it sounds like you overextended yourself. Like, no one except a court can force you to pay, so at some point you made the choice to take over their bills. You don\u2019t mention if your Dad screamed/bullied/guilted you into it, which you should identify if he did, as otherwise it sounds like you volunteered/offered. If you volunteered, or worse offered without being even asked for support, then you don\u2019t get around and present yourself as a martyr about it. Did you even tell him how tight things are for you and you would appreciate if they come into any money for them to pay their own bills first? sorry, but if they get money as a gift, often people (not all, of course) in that situation will use it to buy something nice/fun if their necessities are already being covered as they realize they won\u2019t have that ability again for a while to buy something fun/want. Like if they found $20 on the street they\u2019ll buy take out. It\u2019s like in the Great Depression movies and sales of small things like lipstick remained popular in the US as people were still buying those things to pick themselves up in the awful situation. \n\nYou need to evaluate what you can afford to give, or if you want to continue to support them at all. You can\u2019t set yourself on fire for them, not when you have children who are dependent on you.", "INFO.  Before we can pass judgement, we need to know how much money the parents received and more importantly, what the giver of the money intended for the money to be used for.\n\nLet's say it was $50 with no defined purpose.  Then I'd say NAH, as that little would not make a significant dent in expenses for either household.  But let's say it was $500.   OK, that might help for a week or so.  If it wasn't ear-marked for some specific purpose.\n\nHere's the other variable.  What was the money for?  Let's say the giver knew their car was having problems and they needed $500 to fix it.  So the giver gives them $500 for Christmas, telling them that he wants the money to go toward fixing their car.  Then I'd say NAH, as the parents would be spending the money as directed by the giver.\n\n(in that case, it would have been more helpful for the giver to just gift cash, with no stated purpose for the cash...but your parents do not control how the giver spends their money)\n\nIf they got say $300 or more and the giver did not include instructions on what specific purpose was intended for the money, then I'd say NTA.\n\nBut here's the problem.  If you can't answer the questions above (how  much, what purpose) there is no way for you to obtain such information politely.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I believe they are taking advantage of you and your generosity. If neither of them can honestly work, they can apply for welfare and get energy assistance, foodstamps, etc, and hit the foodbanks, where in most cases they keep a supply of necessities. But, I'm concerned his wife just doesn't want to work. If she's been denied disability benefits that many times, it's possible her affliction is less physical and more just not not wanting to. In the meantime, they must understand your finances only stretch so far, and there's times you just can't cover all their bases as well as your own.
