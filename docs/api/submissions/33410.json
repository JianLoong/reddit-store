His lack of planning does not constitute an emergency on your part.", "Sometimes people don\u2019t like their partners having any interests outside of them and their needs.  It\u2019s jealousy and the denigrating of your hobby is a form of exercising control. He wants to take something away from you that brings you joy.", "He can't be bothered to do a spot of shopping and was looking for an easy way out.  He needs to pop to the shops, tell him he'll be doing the local shops a favour as a lot of them lose out to on-line shopping.", "NTA. This whole thing is bizarre. What took place in your story took longer than him running to target and just grabbing random toys and/or pokemon packs. \nWhy try to give away your collectibles when it\u2019s cheaper and easier just to pick this stuff up at ANY store. Literally just go to the closest dollar store and clear them out of pokemon packs or other toys and donate them.", "NTA\n\nI was stressed about the idea of my husband\u2019s collection being damaged or stollen, so as a gift I cataloged it.\n\nI make a spreadsheet, and cataloged each game\u2019s title, system, and case type and made it sortable based on those and on series. I also took photos of the spines so that I had some sort of proof.\n\nI actually need to go through and update it. But when we were having someone house sit for us, I replaced the doorknob with a locking one, like you would see on the front door, with its own special key so that we can lock the room if we need to.\n\nIt really isn\u2019t difficult to support your spouse\u2019s hobby.", "NTA but you need to document every collectible you have and you need to reflect carefully on how much respect your husband has for you. It's not hard to do an online order at a shop for some lego or pick it up on the way to work. Why is he asking you to give up the things you treasure? You need to seriously review your relationship because he's disrespecting you and this is throwing up all kinds of red flags...", "NTA. If I was you, hide a camera focused on your collection just in case.", "NTA\u2026those are your possessions and while he didn\u2019t know the value of things and thought that he\u2019d get rid of some old junk toys that he doesn\u2019t want around, and how he could cheaply complete this donation with as little work as possible.\n\nNow for the responsible behavior after your partner has been informed at how valuable your belongings are, is to take pictures of and make a google doc with all of your collection. Make sure to note any specific characteristics and all the creation details so that if your things go missing you know exactly what the value is. If he EVER takes any of it with your express permission report the items stolen to the police.", "NTA. I have a hard time believing your husband didn\u2019t already know the value or actually thought those would be appropriate gifts for a charity toy drive. He certainly isn\u2019t so stupid as to think it would be wiser to donate your black series helmet collection or old card packs to young kids than it would be for him to pop into a store and buy some cheap toys. \n\nOP, do some digging here. Make sure this guy isn\u2019t funneling money. You basically stated you don\u2019t know how much it cost to replace his stolen golf clubs and he didn\u2019t know the value of your collection. That right there tells me you both have plenty of room to commit financial infidelity. Is it possible he \u201cneeded\u201d those items to sell? I seriously find it hard to believe he is that ignorant. It\u2019s also beyond weaponized incompetence. \n\nThen he gas lit you about your collection being unsafe from theft. Yes, I can just see the burglers now making off with your extremely largely boxed helmets (if these helmets were unboxed that\u2019s even more suspicious- he was going to donate used/displayed collector items to kids in need of actual toys?) Most robbers aren\u2019t going through drawers looking for the pokemon cards lmao. Does he give you jewelry? Is it also unsafe for you to keep your jewelry at home? \n\nIt sounded almost like an angry warning to me. I\u2019d dee dive the finances before your collection is \u201cstolen\u201d like his golf clubs were. I\u2019d also consider insuring the cards. He knew your collection was valuable just like he knew his clubs were valuable. He didn\u2019t think you were getting those helmets on a 90% clearance sale. They\u2019re adult-collectible reproduction helmets. He knows they carry worth.", "NTA\n\nhe said you are stupid\n\nBut you were only TEMPTED to correct him?\n\nWhy do I feel as though there is a distinct power imbalance in your relationship.", "Nta but why are you still married to someone who doesn\u2019t respect your hobbies and is greedy to want your stuff to donate?", "You think it's 8 grand to replace some golf clubs? You are dumb to have that stuff just laying around.  NAH", "ESH--he asked, you could have just said no.  He was wrong to leave it so late, wrong to ask at all because it's your stuff, and wrong to get het up at you about your collection, but literally you could have just said no instead of turning this into some sort of life-lesson/display of his wrongness.  \"No, honey, they're mine and they're expensive--let's go to Target and see what's on clearance.\"  One sentence, no conflict.", "Hello, I'm in a similar position. I'm a curiosity collector. My partner wanted to give one of my items away, however it is very valuable. It is the Ark of the Covenant.
