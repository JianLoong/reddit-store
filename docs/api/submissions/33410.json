Make sure this guy isn\u2019t funneling money. You basically stated you don\u2019t know how much it cost to replace his stolen golf clubs and he didn\u2019t know the value of your collection. That right there tells me you both have plenty of room to commit financial infidelity. Is it possible he \u201cneeded\u201d those items to sell?

Yes, I can just see the burglers now making off with your extremely largely boxed helmets (if these helmets were unboxed that\u2019s even more suspicious- he was going to donate used/displayed collector items to kids in need of actual toys?) Most robbers aren\u2019t going through drawers looking for the pokemon cards lmao. Does he give you jewelry? Is it also unsafe for you to keep your jewelry at home? \n\nIt sounded almost like an angry warning to me. I\u2019d dee dive the finances before your collection is \u201cstolen\u201d like his golf clubs were. I\u2019d also consider insuring the cards. He knew your collection was valuable just like he knew his clubs were valuable. He didn\u2019t think you were getting those helmets on a 90% clearance sale.
