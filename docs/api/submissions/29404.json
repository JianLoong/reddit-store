Anything less than two months the government won't pay as they see that is \"holiday\" rather than being enough time to care and bond with a new child. \n\nMy partner works in her family's mid-sized company and is apparently set to become an owner at some point, but there is no contract or oral agreements as to when or how this will happen. Her father is her boss and has basically said that she cannot take any time off after the baby is born. This is technically illegal in Germany as a boss, but as a dad....well inheritance, fear or being kicked out the family and wanting to be guaranteed a spot to being an owner when he retires gives him the power to do what he wants to her. \n\nMaybe it's the pregnancy hormones, maybe it's legitimate, but I'm beyond pissed and just feel down right hurt.  From my perspective it feels like a boundary crossing over a topic that should only be decided between me and her. And to be fair, we decided to only have her take off the minimum two months (one when the baby is born and one split into two months part-time when I go back to work) and have me stay at home for a year so that way she is there for her company. \n\nThat being said from the financial perspective: I earn currently nearly double her hourly wage (16 vs 31 Eur) and after I finish my further training could be earning about 100- 120 Eur an hour in freelance work which is probably more than her dad earns now as owner of his company. But, I love my partner and want to support her dreams as well - regardless of money. \n\nThis whole thing with her dad meddling and stopping us from having her be home for a month after the birth has upset me so much that I have said that I don't want to see him or have him have a relationship with our child. Especially since all conversations have become fights between my partner and him and our anxiety is just soaring. Basically his reasoning is, \"I wasn't home after the birth of my kids - you'll be fine\". And \"think of your responsibility to the company\". The latter just pisses me off because what about my responsibility to my career and future company. And the former: well it's our decision, right? \n\nAnyways fights with the dad tend to not have any winner besides the dad. And so the whole family is more interested in changing our perspective than his. They generally just do what he says.  And so at this point I feel like I might need to break off contact to the whole family as well because I feel like I don't want to adapt to this family culture and I want the decisions on how and who cares for our child to remain between my partner and I. And I feel overwhelmed and hopeless in changing his mind, especially with no support from the family. \n\nAm I being too dramatic and am the asshole?", "created_utc": 1697922917, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17dcn0g/aita_i_29f_am_breaking_off_contact_with_my_inlaws/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
