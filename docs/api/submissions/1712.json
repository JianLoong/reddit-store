We do spend a *lot* of time together, however. We work at the same company in different departments, but we eat breakfast and lunch together everyday. Also, we're both team leads so we get together every other week for about an hour to go over \"project details\". That usually takes about 5 minutes and we spend the rest of the time goofing off together. We have dinner together everyday as well, with Tuesday and Sunday being the specific \"date\" nights where we get ready separately and meet up at a place. In the recent years, I stay over at her place twice a week and she stays over at mine on date nights. We also go on out of town trips 3-4 times a year. \n\nRecently everything in our personal/family lives has been great and after 7 years of dating, we're finally moving in together for the long term at the end of the year. This will be our third attempt. We mesh pretty well living together, but we had some pretty drastic familial issues about 5 years ago on my side and about 2 years ago on hers unrelated to our relationship. We had a conversation and decided to free up 4 hrs on Saturday and Sunday for time apart until the move to do our own thing and it was working out great at first. I've been kinda burnt out on all the socializing so I decided to pick up another run of Skyrim at the start August. This is where it started to go downhill. Beginning of October, I guess she was also burnt out on all the socializing so she started hanging out at my place while I gamed. At first she would just read a book, or watch some TV, but it spiraled into full-blown backseat gaming. \"Babe, you spent all that time back tracking for like 12 gold\", \"Babe, you've been grinding smithing/enchanting/alchemy for 3 hours, do something else\", \"Babe, I thought you were going to stop using a bow\", \"Babe I don't think you would cut it as a streamer\", and so on. I kept reminding her that I wasn't playing for her enjoyment and this was supposed to be my alone time like she had hers but she would start back up after a while. It got to the point where I would flinch and get agitated whenever I heard \"babe\" outside of the gaming time. It all kind of came to a head when she complained about me speaking 3 hours just downloading and testing nexus mods. I finally just kicked her out of my apartment and canceled date night last night because I was upset. I told her she wasn't going to come over just to get on my nerves, and she needed to bring some kind of activity for herself or not come over at all. I already give her the time around the four hours, the least she could do is let me have some peace. She never answered my goodnight text and told me she's eating breakfast alone today. I'm starting to feel really bad about the whole thing. This is our first fight in about a year and a half and it was over Skyrim of all things.

You agreed on time to yourselves, time apart, it was clear you were burnt out and needed some space. You spoke to her about not backseat gaming, and she just continued stomping all over your boundaries.\n\nYes, you could have reacted better. Sat her down for a calm but firm come-to-jesus talk about boundaries and respecting space. Made it clear, in as pleasant a way as possible, that she doesn't seem to have been hearing you when you're asking for space. So you need to make it very clear.\n\nYou can still have that talk. But, you are human. As someone who has a father who takes great delight in stomping my boundaries and pushing me to my last nerve, I get it. Apologise for the way you spoke, but make it clear that although you are sorry for being so rude, this is a valid issue and it needs to be resolved before you move in together.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Last time I checked, that is communicating with your SO about your feelings and not liking something they do. You kicked her out only after a month of her backseating after repeated requests not to do so.\n\nThere is nothing preventing her from loading up a savefile in her own PC or console (if she doesn't care for mods) and play Skyrim how she wants. It is your leisure time and your savefile and you should be allowed to play however you want. There is nothing more annoying while playing than dealing with a backseater who wants you to play as they want you to play. Communication was done very well from your side. You're not the asshole if she doesn't care about and respect your feelings which you have expressed multiple times already. She's the asshole here."]}
