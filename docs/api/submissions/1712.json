We do spend a *lot* of time together, however. We work at the same company in different departments, but we eat breakfast and lunch together everyday. Also, we're both team leads so we get together every other week for about an hour to go over \"project details\". That usually takes about 5 minutes and we spend the rest of the time goofing off together. We have dinner together everyday as well, with Tuesday and Sunday being the specific \"date\" nights where we get ready separately and meet up at a place. In the recent years, I stay over at her place twice a week and she stays over at mine on date nights. We also go on out of town trips 3-4 times a year. \n\nRecently everything in our personal/family lives has been great and after 7 years of dating, we're finally moving in together for the long term at the end of the year. This will be our third attempt. We mesh pretty well living together, but we had some pretty drastic familial issues about 5 years ago on my side and about 2 years ago on hers unrelated to our relationship. We had a conversation and decided to free up 4 hrs on Saturday and Sunday for time apart until the move to do our own thing and it was working out great at first. I've been kinda burnt out on all the socializing so I decided to pick up another run of Skyrim at the start August. This is where it started to go downhill. Beginning of October, I guess she was also burnt out on all the socializing so she started hanging out at my place while I gamed. At first she would just read a book, or watch some TV, but it spiraled into full-blown backseat gaming. \"Babe, you spent all that time back tracking for like 12 gold\", \"Babe, you've been grinding smithing/enchanting/alchemy for 3 hours, do something else\", \"Babe, I thought you were going to stop using a bow\", \"Babe I don't think you would cut it as a streamer\", and so on. I kept reminding her that I wasn't playing for her enjoyment and this was supposed to be my alone time like she had hers but she would start back up after a while. It got to the point where I would flinch and get agitated whenever I heard \"babe\" outside of the gaming time. It all kind of came to a head when she complained about me speaking 3 hours just downloading and testing nexus mods. I finally just kicked her out of my apartment and canceled date night last night because I was upset. I told her she wasn't going to come over just to get on my nerves, and she needed to bring some kind of activity for herself or not come over at all. I already give her the time around the four hours, the least she could do is let me have some peace. She never answered my goodnight text and told me she's eating breakfast alone today. I'm starting to feel really bad about the whole thing. This is our first fight in about a year and a half and it was over Skyrim of all things.

Last time I checked, that is communicating with your SO about your feelings and not liking something they do. You kicked her out only after a month of her backseating after repeated requests not to do so.\n\nThere is nothing preventing her from loading up a savefile in her own PC or console (if she doesn't care for mods) and play Skyrim how she wants. It is your leisure time and your savefile and you should be allowed to play however you want. There is nothing more annoying while playing than dealing with a backseater who wants you to play as they want you to play. Communication was done very well from your side. You're not the asshole if she doesn't care about and respect your feelings which you have expressed multiple times already. She's the asshole here.", "NTA. People need time to themselves, period. They shouldn't have to justify it, argue about it, etc. I could have written your post years ago about one relationship and it didn't end well. I don't know about your case, but in mine, she just needed CONSTANT validation and couldn't take not getting it any time I did my own thing. She even got mad at me for \"ignoring her\" when I had to fix a leak in the bathroom for a couple hours. Sure enough, any time I wasn't around, she'd seek that validation/attention from other men.\n\nIf people can't enjoy their own company, they have no business expecting anyone else to enjoy it.", "As the non-gaming wife of a responsible husband who gives his all, and needs a few hours of alone gaming to help himself unwind sometimes, NTA. She is being defensive when confronted with not respecting your requests, and instead of reacting in a loving mature way to meet both of your needs, she\u2019s stonewalling you. That\u2019s not mature or healthy communication. It\u2019s ok to need alone time, it\u2019s healthy.", "NTA, and the argument wasn't about Skyrim. You should seriously reconsider moving in together. You spend almost ALL of your time together. She apparently criticizes you (only when you're gaming, or all the time?), backseat-drives (again, in more than just the game?), and annoys you. You have set a very small window of time apart--and she's ignoring it. To criticize and annoy you.\n\nShe sounds exhausting. She apparently has no hobbies (or friends?) outside of you. This will get much worse if you live together. If you really love her, get couples counseling focused on communication and boundaries, because almost nobody (even the most extroverted & in-love) could deal with this.", "NTA. I don't know why all the E S H are saying you both need to communicate since you've already been doing that when she started backseat gaming. Like what more can you communicate with should you start making hand written notes and reviews on what she's doing wrong.", "NTA - I think it's very healthy for people to have time away from each other in a relationship.  You guys don't really have that since you also work together.  You both agreed to 4 hours separate from each other on Saturday and on Sunday, and she's not holding up her end of that.  Can you move your gaming to a different room so that you're in separate areas of the house?  That might help, especially after she moves in.", "NTA - In the beginning it was fine because you can be alone in the same place.  She was reading a book or watching TV, basically doing another solo activity but simply being in the same place.  It only became a problem when she stopped doing her activity to comment on his gaming and no longer leaving him alone.   When you're living with someone it's very important to be able to have alone time together.  She needs to learn how to respect your boundary of having alone time even if she is physically in the same place.", "I'm more on your side, but going to say ESH. What she's doing is annoying, you asked her to stop and she didn't, but where this escalated to makes me skeptical of your ability to communicate with each other.", "NTA I  agree you did ask her not to backseat on your game. She had other stuff she chose not to do. I do understand that. It was a boundary and communication issue.\n\n I've had games interrupted by my wife also. Its frustrating.  I've learned it's a game and laugh it off. Game vs life, easy life wins. There's times I've interrupted whatever she's doing. It happens the bigger picture is needed.\n\nYou need to work on you communication skills with your girlfriend.  Both of you need to learn how to speak and listen to each other. This episode is just a symptom of that. \n\n7 years together no marriage yet or engagement.  A couple failed live together times. Think about what you want and work towards that.", ">I kept reminding her that I wasn't playing for her enjoyment and this was supposed to be my alone time like she had hers but she would start back up after a while. \n\nWhat, specifically, is lacking in OP's communication skills?", "I'd say that he doesn't know how to set up a boundary and keep it.\n\nIt is clear from the post that he wants alone time. Yet he allowed her to go to his apartment during those 4 hours dedicated to alone time. \n\nHe had no guts of telling her as it was building up that she was annoying him. He just waited until he blew up.\n\nThose are terrible communication skills and OP needs to learn how to speak his feelings instead of sucking up for as long as he can until he blows up.\n\nThis could've been avoided with a simple \"sorry babe but I'd rather be by myself those few hours so I can decompress without feeling .... \" however it was making him feel.\n\nI don't mean to claim I know what the original commenter meant but as I agree with the comment I wanted to give my pov on the situation"]}
