I'm legitimately worried about getting enough rest to not have a seizure, and I feel like it's just not going to be doable with this setup. \n\n\n\n\nMy wife and I are set to go on a grand canyon hiking trip in a few days. We're going with her mom and two teenage brothers. \n\nFor whatever reason, I suddenly wondered about the room and asked my wife tonight what the room setup is, and that's when I found out that we're all staying in one room.\n\nI immediately was like \"Wait we're all sharing a room?\" then she starts saying how she told me we were, because we wanted to keep it a \"cheap trip\". I told her I don't remember that at all (I would remember if she had told me that because I absolutely hate the idea) and that she had only told me that we were staying in the cheapest hotel we could find (which I don't mind at all). \nShes now saying it's inconsiderate of me to tell her that I don't like the idea (even though I'd swear she never told me up till now) and threatening to just cancel my ticket so she doesn't \"have to deal with my stupid weird thing about sharing a room\" and my \"stupid need for food\" (referring to the fact that I need to fairly consistently be eating, or I run the risk of triggering a seizure). \n\nWe're driving 3 hours from Vegas to our hotel after we land in the evening, then the next morning we have an hour and a half drive to our starting point for our hike. Each day we're doing a day hike, so that's 3 hours of driving in top of the hiking. We'll then come back to the hotel and we'll have to deal with everyone using the one bathroom, then just the weird factor of sharing a room with my MIL. Add in two teenage teenage boys (they're gross. I was one, and no matter what anyone says, teenage boys are gross, especially after hiking 8-10 hours) and it's just a big ole pile of no thank you. \n\nOn a more serious note about part of my bid for not sharing a room: I have epilepsy, and the one fear I've had leading up to this is this off chance of me having a seizure during our hike. The kicker is that one of the biggest triggers for me to possibly have a seizure is sleep, or lack thereof, and the other main one (mentioned above) is eating well. So given that we'd be sharing a room with others now, I'm worried about being able to get enough rest to where I can still wake up at 6 or 7am and not feel like going to have a seizure that day.", "created_utc": 1680581464, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12b8md4/aita_for_not_wanting_to_share_a_hotel_room_with/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She even like you? She sure doesn't sound like it.\n\nBut no, your not the asshole for wanting your own space for a vacation, especially if you are paying for it (edited to add, I mean paying for their share). Is it even worth going at this point?", "NTA and to add: your wife sound Very dismissive of your opinion, feelings and most of all the medical aspect.", "NTA. but more importantly, why is your wife so cold about your epilepsy??? That's a big red flag. It's reasonable that you would want your own space to get good sleep. Also, teen boys are scavengers lol what if they eat your food? I don't like that this is some weird sore spot for her. How would your MIL feel if you wanted a separate room? Would you be met with the same irritability?", "NTA If you can afford a second room, do that. If you can\u2019t, don\u2019t go. I\u2019m fairly horrified that your wife called your regular need for food \u201cstupid\u201d given that hunger triggers seizures. I hope she\u2019s generally more compassionate.", "NTA.  Gross, I would not share a room with that many people. I'm a light sleeper and I don't want my inlaws to hear me take a poo in the morning like a normal person. It's way easier to appreciate your in laws and enjoy a vacation if you have some space to recharge and actually be well rested. The room set up sounds awful and I would book my own room and I don't even have a medical concern.\n\nLet her cancel your ticket. Your wife is being unreasonable and totally disregarding your comfort. I would stay home because it sounds like this is gonna suck anyway.\n\nEdit: grammar", "NTA. I don\u2019t like sharing a room with anyone, and I\u2019m not worrying about seizures on top of it. That\u2019s not worth saving a few bucks.", "NTA \n\nYou've already said that booking another room is not an option... don't go on vacation, is the only. If you go sounds like you would be miserable and your wife is being inconsiderate. \n\nHave a nice peaceful staycation instead.", "NTA\n\nAnd your wife is being rude about it too. Check to see if you can book another room?  Maybe ask for a discount since you already booked one", "NTA\n\nJust stay home. The point of the trip is to have fun and this ain't that. If you penny pinch too much, you'll ruin the trip. She's done that.", "Five people, single bathroom is a recipe for disaster and that is in the morning before you have to leave for 1.5 drive to hike while day, and then in the evening, when you will be returning 1.5 hours driving in a car in your after hike glow and then queuing for the bathroom again. Pretty sure everyone will be miserable, better to get another room booked already for you two and at least have a chance to have a good time. Yes, it will be even more expensive, but you will have some joy after everything. The alternative is everyone will be bitter and the entire trip will be ruined.", "NTA.\n\nOh my god. Why would she think this is a good idea for anyone?\n\nBut much more serious is her complaining about you having to eat regularly because you have epilepsy. \n\nI have a lot of food restrictions (not because of epilepsy, but major allergies) and the people who care about me not dying are sometimes more obsessed about what I can't eat than I am! Any one who cares about your basic survival and wellbeing would do everything they can to ensure that you are safe.\n\nOP, I would also be concerned about your sleep. Lack of quality sleep is a super common epilepsy trigger that is well-documented. I would recommend staying home, honestly.", "NTA- however, I'm sure going forward, you'll probably be more interested in being involved in the logistics and planning for future trips.  My husband is not a planner, and I communicate everything I'm booking and buying for trips.  I also learned from experience I need to remind and repeat that information to him because he is a sleep deprived shift worker.  \n\n\nCommunicate with each other more.  She may have mentioned it to you but not been clear enough.", "Nta; send your wife off for a lovely trip and stay home", "INFO: who is paying for this trip? Is it too late to book an additional room?", "INFO: you said in other comment that given the price of additional room ($500) getting another room is not an option. SO what do you want? For your MIL and boys not to come to the trip?  What is your proposed solution?", "NTA. You have epilepsy which needs to be managed, moreso during trips. Having two teenage boys and your MIL in a small space sounds stressful to begin with, it\u2019s even more of hassle to ask for them to accomodate you when it\u2019s time to turn in for the night, or in case you have to wake up early to eat.\n\nIf your wife is being like this now...what more if you encounter issues. I\u2019d say separate room, or just make your own plans while they\u2019re on their trip.", "NTA- I was going to say maybe y t a because there\u2019s nothing wrong with sharing hotel rooms. I would have no problem staying in the same room as my mother-in-law. My husband and I have stayed in a room with her plenty of times. BUT the fact that it\u2019s five people with only one bathroom is definitely too much and I definitely wouldn\u2019t want to do that either. Not to mention your wife\u2019s obvious disrespect towards your medical needs, calling them stupid. And on top of all that, you have a very valid medical reason for needing to be well rested. You are absolutely NTA in this situation", "I\u2019m sorry, \u201cstupid need for food\u201d???? NTA omg", "NTA\n\nFirstly. My husband has epilepsy and sleep deprivation triggers it. Your condition demand a good nights sleep and sharing with many people is not beneficial. Your health trump's anything else. \n\nSecondly. No way in hell that I would share a room with my MIL or make my husband share a room with my parents. We're too old. We are adults with a sex life, basic needs like taking a dump on the toilet without having MIL outside the door,  taking medication in private, the need to relax without other people, not having to deal with her snoring etc.", "Sorry it sucks but your wife booked an immensely cheap trip and it would have cost much more to get you your own room.\n\nIn my opinion, the person who doesn't book has the responsibility to make sure the person who does book tells them what's going on and not the other way around.  Though both sides should communicate, really you should have asked sooner if it matters to you, and it does.  \n\nThat said, either go or stay home or pay for another hotel.

But for whatever reason she doesnt fully grasp what the triggers for my seizures are - or why - no matter how much I've explained it. Then tends to kind of disregard them except for here and there.", "I didn't think about that. I'll check with the hotel in the morning", "I don't disagree about the communication. If anything, this is a learning experience for us.\n\nI usually book our trips, but run every detail by her before booking in order to make sure she's ok with it all. With this, she kind of ran bare bone details by me during booking or soon after, and I just assumed that the details she gave were all there was to it", "We (my wife and I - we share incomes) are paying for our portion, and her mom is paying for her and her son's portion.\n\nGiven the limited time, booking another room would be close to $500 at this point.

It wouldn't be my first choice, but of course that would be ridiculous for me to push back on that.\n\nBut I feel like it's just too much having 5 people in one room with one bathroom/shower - 2 being teenage boys - on a trip where you need lots of good rest and to be able to relax when not hiking,", "I don't disagree about who should be asking who, in normal circumstances. \n\nMy thing is, I truly didn't think about it till now. Why? Because honestly, it seems like common sense to assume that we - a full grown adult, married couple - would have our own room, so it doesn't feel like it's something I should have even had to ask.\n\nI usually book our trips (this is the first one she's ever taken care of without me), and I always check everything with her to make sure she's ok with whatever it is. I give details about what it will entail (driving time, positives and negatives about each option, etc).\nWith this, she gave me bare details that I assumed were the full details. I can't ask questions if I don't know there's anything to ask about.", "Comfort beats cost. If you really want to do the trip, just get another room. Who cares what MIL or someone else thinks.

Your health is not important to her.", "This makes sense then if you're usually the planner.  She's probably used to receiving information and not giving it.\n\nYour health risks should always be a key component of travel planning, but that is your job to stress to her the importance of that.  It is her job to support you to ensure your safety as your partner just as much as you would for her.  \n\nBest of luck, I hope it sorts out.", "Williams has some quaint but clean sub-$100 roadside inns.

That's flights, a car, an Airbnb, and food.", "I will say this is a family by family thing.  My family has shared rooms with couples and so has my in-laws.

I figure flying anywhere is at least $150 each and a car is $25 a day and a hotels are on the very low end $60 / day but you must be good at getting amazing deals."]}
