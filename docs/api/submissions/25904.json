When we were adults we got jobs and moved in together, I made minimum wage while she made decent money. I would also watch her cat for her when she was at work (worked flyin-fly out). One day we got into an argument because I got accepted for a well paying job that unfortunately meant I also would not be home for a couple days at a time, she lost it and said if i couldnt take care of her cat then I had to leave or pay all the rent so she could hire a cat sitter. She then threatened me with violence and getting rid of all my belongings if I didnt go immediately. So I was made homeless in the middle of winter, luckily I was able to crash on my friends couch until I saved up for a new place. A couple months later my sister and I talked and she apologized, I accepted the apology but our relationship hasn't been the same. now its been about 3 years since then. My sister called and said that she has missed a lot of work due to this or that and needed help with money for rent, I paid her rent because even though she made me homeless I dont want her to go through that. Now a month later she called again and is asking for more money and is promising to eventually pay it back. I honestly have little trust that she will because she never learned to manage money. I told her that the position she put me in sucks because she literally made me homeless and didnt care about my financial struggle at all when I had nothing. \nShe said she didn't know what to say because I was right and it was shitty of her. I feel bad because I hate hurting people and I know how bad the price of living is right now. So AITA for not helping my sister finacially?\n\nEdit: I forgot to add that from the outside her life doesn't look great at the moment, and appears to be falling apart. I feel like she may do something super drastic to herself if she loses her place because she is very impulsive and has a history of depression. So yeah I feel like im in a very tight spot.\n\nEdit 2: Im still reading through all the comments thanks you all so much for your input. Some people were worried about the cat, I found out she rehomed the cat a couple days after she kicked me out.\n\nupdate: thank you all so much. After reading through everyones comments I made the decision that although I wouldnt be an asshole to not give her money, I could not live with myself if something happened. I also can't stand the thought of any of my siblings suffering when its preventable, so I called my older sister. Turns out my fear of her doing something drastic was right, she admitted to being severely depressed and had no other options. I told her I would help her with some more bills and am in the middle of talking about her going to therapy. I don't even care about being paid back at this point. Ill pay for therapy too if I have to. I do want to say I don't have a problem saying no, setting boundaries, or cutting toxic people out ( i have done this with family/friends before). This just boiled down to helping or potentially losing my sister. \nThank you all so much again for your comments \u2764\ufe0f", "created_utc": 1693466748, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16645vu/aita_for_not_helping_my_family_finacially_after/", "score": 1981, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don't owe her anything.  Stop giving her money, it's only encouraging her to ask for more.

She's not blaming the boyfriend, she's saying there's nothing she can think of to excuse her actions and it was her bad behaviour at fault.\n\nIf you want something more from her, have a conversation about your expectations. If I apologised to someone, they said they accepted my apology and still wanted a relationship with me, I'd think the issue was dealt with and learn from my screwup. On the other side, when I truly accept an apology I don't bring that subject up again.\n\nIf you don't think you'll ever be able to look past her past behaviour, be honest and tell her that.

You say the problems stem from not managing money. She knows damn well, as does everyone everywhere, bills need to be paid. Rent gets paid or you get evicted.

You continuing to pay isn't getting her anywhere but it would be getting her a free ride to keep doing it.", "NTA. Her emergency is not yours.", "NTA. It sounds like both of you are struggling in different ways with the burdens your parents placed on you as children. You aren\u2019t obligated to extend help to her after the way she treated you, but it does sound like you still have a lot of emotional ties to her, and that does make it very complicated. You\u2019ll have to decide if the feeling you get is worth paying money in that you do not think will be paid back. \n\nEven if her boyfriend was a motivating factor behind her actions, she needs to take responsibility for them. It\u2019s important to you being able to find an emotional resolution. My mother tried to find other things to blame for her actions and it poisoned our relationship.", "NTA. She picked a CAT over you. I think you really need to let that sink in. It doesn\u2019t matter that she said I am sorry that means nothing without action behind it and from this post and some of your comments it doesn\u2019t sound like she has put any actual actions to show how sorry she truly is. You have already done enough and have supported her way more than she did for you. You shouldn\u2019t feel bad about not paying for her rent because she literally did not care if you were homeless so why should you.

So long as you leave enough water out - we leave several bowls around the house - a full bowl of food - or a timed automatic feeder - and a clean litter box, cats are fine for at least 3 or 4 days at a time on their own. When we\u2019ve traveled for longer durations, we\u2019ve had friends check in on the cat(s) every 3 days or so (more often if they want extra cat time, or if we have a streaming service that they don\u2019t). \n\nAnd yeah, dogs are a different issue completely; ours gets walked twice a day, is never left home alone for more than ~10 hours; if we\u2019re gone longer than that, we usually board him, so that our friends don\u2019t have the hassle of walking him.", "Because it's a living creature, and they should at least get checked on daily to make sure they aren't sick, hurt, lonely or in need of food, water and a clean litter box.", "Accepting an apology doesn't mean they won't do the same thing again.

Here in Norway, cats have to get checked on at least every 24h by law, because they are living creatures. They can get hurt, they can get sick, they can get lonely. People who get cats thinking it's okay to just leave them alone for days at the time should never be allowed to have them.", "And that's fine if that's what you want to do. But it's important to be real with the people around you about your expectations in a relationship. \n\nI wouldn't want to sustain relationships I couldn't trust in. If I accepted an apology but didn't forgive to the point of trust, I wouldn't want to keep that person in my life. If they had to be in my life, I would let them know my limits so we could all manage our expectations for the relationship.\n\nForgiveness doesn't mean forgetting. I haven't forgotten some bad things people have done in my life. But when I believe they are truly sorry and make steps to change their behaviour, I'm good with that.

Granted, the litterbox will be the first order of business when she gets home but...wtf.", "NTA\n\nAt the core of what you're asking, even ignoring the various indecencies your sister committed to you in the past, you're basically asking if you'd be the asshole to turn your sister down knowing that you will inevitably be asked again and never see any of what is owed back.  Further, you're effectively asking us if you'd be the asshole to turn her down when you know on some level she's drowning due to her own issues and inadequacies.\n\nMy answer is, \"don't light yourself on fire to keep others warm.\" She's your sister, and I get you want to help her, but there comes a point where your help is just enabling her to continue to spiral.

This woman needs therapy first and foremost, and perhaps some financial literacy courses.", "I think this goes beyond AITA.\n\nWhat she did to you sucked.

Do you think you are better off without her in your life?\n\nIf you have money to help then it's not money issue, it's if you care enough about her to help her and help beyond financial aid but to be there and guide her towards improving her over all situations.\n\nIf you borrow her money set up boundaries, expectations and plan on how she can figure out her life instead of asking you for money every month.\n\nBut if you do not care about her in your life now or in future then she is not your problem and do not lend her that money.", "NTa.

I mean, was there something wrong with the cat that required more attention?", "NTA. Do not listen to the commenters saying ''if you care about her, offer her help.'' You can care about her while simultaneously not helping her. You give her the money, God forbid you face some hardships yourself, I guarantee your sister will not help you. That rent money you gave away would've helped you then. It's not like you turned a blind eye to her struggles, you already paid her rent once. \n\nI just want to tell you that don't feel bad that you are hurting her because you're not, you don't owe her anything.

If you say no, there is absolutely no judgement or anything.\n\nIt seems like there is a part of you that still wants to help her. So if you do end up helping, you could sit down with her and in exchange for one final bit of help, she has to set a good financial plan. Make sure she knows where every cent is going for the next few months. If she has enough, then you have already helped her and she doesn't need to \"borrow\" money. If she really doesn't have enough, then you can decide if you want to help. But in order to get the help, she has to cut back on every optional expense. No more restaurants, no more clothes, no more alcohol, no more anything that isn't essential to her and her cat living. Only then should you give anything.", "In dysfunctional families, the few members who are wise about money and life are often expected to rescue the others. Ask yourself if you want to be drafted into that role.  Help one and word gets around.\n\nOP Odd Rice is right - require a written repayment schedule if you consider lending money to your sister again.\n\nIf you have it in you to lend her money one more time, consider making it conditional on her taking and completing a course on how to budget and take care of business.  If she's unwilling or unable to do that, it sounds like your sister needs a case manager.", "NTA you already done enough. You accepted the apology and offered some help.

Unless the feeder has a back up battery don't the settings revert to default which means no food comes out. When I check in on my mom's cat while she's away I have to make sure that the feeder is still set properly.", "I'm at home most days, and this is why I found a good cattery for when I go on holiday. It's not a one-size-fits-all situation, but for all that she isn't fond of other cats, my cat certainly prefers going to the familiar cattery once/twice a year with familiar people and annoying feline neighbours to grumble at, than dealing with being left alone and seeing people only once or twice a day.", "Yeah, but\u2026isn\u2019t the sister checking on her cat before she goes to work? And afterwards? \n\nI get it, I ask people to stop by for my cat when I\u2019m out of town even though I know he has plenty of water, a clean box, and that his punk ass knows how to open his food bin if the feeder were to go empty, because he\u2019s very social and loves love. But if it\u2019s just throughout the work day, I don\u2019t see why this would be a necessity?", "Ours actually do have a backup battery. And I honestly don\u2019t worry about it too much because we do have someone come in every couple days, and cats will be fine if they miss a couple meals too. Water I worry about more.", "When we travel, we have a friend come feed the cat dinner and hang out with them for a couple hours. He loves cats and doesn't have his own, and the cat loves him, win-win for them!", "Exactly. I was cat sitting one day and was surprised when I wasn't greeted at the door by one of the cats. Somehow the door of a small room had managed to close behind him and he was stuck in there for who knows how long with no food, water, or litter box. He could not have been there for too long, because there were no \"accidents\" but he was extremely stressed at not being able to get out. Good thing I went by every day. \n\nOur cats follow us from room to room and  are always very close to us. If you close the door on them they will try to tear the down.

Anything longer smells of animal neglect.\nCats feel best when their routine is uninterrupted, and their human leaving is a big change in routine. This stress may lead to poor immunity, and could end up as fe. urinary infections. That\u2019s why they should be visited at least once a day, so someone could check their litterbox and eating habits. Best option is always to get live-in pet sitter.\nComing from vet tech - cats are quite sensitive creatures. It\u2019s a domestic pet after all, they need their humans in daily life", "Right?

Pets are a privilege, not a right.", "My guess is it's more about smells and feeling secure. Cats like to have their smells mixed with their owner's, so they hang out where they can smell their humans. When the humans leave for a long time and the cat gets lonely and stressed, they go pee on a bed or a sofa, where their human's smell is strong. It's comforting for an insecure cat.\n\nAlthough, urinary tract problems absolutely are very common in cats, and often related to stress. When your cat pees outside a litter box, first make sure the box is clean enough and any stress the cat possibly has is dealt with. If the rogue peeing continues, there are probably infections and/or other health problems, and the cat should be taken to a vet.

But while peeing they need to \u201cpressure\u201d their stomach & back paws, and sandy area isn\u2019t helpful. Especially with silicone litter, which is very loose and often hard on paws.

Either way you go is alright, it depends on your inner beliefs on justice vs mercy.", "NTA but I'm also genuinely curious why the cat needed 24/7 supervision. I've had cats all my life, presently have three of them, and they can look after themselves provided they have food, clean water, a litterbox, and a window or toys for entertainment.", "NTA, but probably best not to give any more money if you can't afford to.", "NTA.  The cat situation seems irrelevant here.  You are a good person.  You gave your sister money to buy her a month of breathing room to get sorted.  From your description, she has not sorted things and is, in fact, continuing to devolve financially.  Your financial assistance is not infinite nor sustainable long term.  \n\nNot being taught budgeting as children is not an excuse for either of you.  You are no longer children.  You should be on your own budget.  You can be supportive and encouraging without being expected to pay her rent repeatedly when she has made no progress in the past month.  Ask yourself if gifting her another month\u2019s rent will make a difference long term or just delay the inevitable.  Does she have a plan?  \n\n\nWe aren\u2019t given much insight into her specific situation but some basics apply.  She should be evaluating income versus expenses.  She can consider alternative housing, roommates, a supplemental part-time job, etc.    You\u2019ve both made it out of tougher spots.

You're too good for this world!", "I wouldn't say more self sufficient than a dog, but socially, is more content with close proximity and does not require constant validation. Dogs can be exhausting for that - you give them direct attention for 15 minutes and they still want more and more all the time.

Your update is disappointing", "If you're still reading after your edit, just make sure to reflect regularly on this going forward.\n\nEvery month, if your sister makes further requests, do a total mental reset of your commitments and take a look at the issue with fresh eyes. Ask yourself if there's been any progress or whether things have gotten worse, whether you can sustain the added costs *this* time, whether your sister's been kind and thankful, whether you're still gaining joy from helping her, etc etc.\n\nI say that because these situations of dependency can easily spiral into a dead end. Sometimes the person gets better. Sometimes they don't, the two of you sinking into a permanent limbo after they habituate to your assistance and become complacent. And *sometimes* they'll drag you down with them - the same inability to regulate their own life can make them incapable of understanding how you need to regulate your own, their requests having zero alignment with your abilities.\n\nIn the background, unfortunately, is the fact that helping the mean and dysfunctional is often self-reinforcing in a perverse way. You set a psychological precedent for yourself that you will give with zero expectation of a return or even a negative return in the case of abusive individuals. That commitment severs you from most of the usual feedback mechanisms that cause a person to quit toxic situations, like the very basic idea of reciprocation.", "I know this is late to the game but the OP said her sister's job was \"fly in/fly out\" so the sister must work out of town for periods of time.  Cat's really shouldn't be left for more than a long weekend even with a constant water and food source (timed feeders, etc.).  Cats get sick and can get injured and need to not be left alone for days on end.  As a cat owner, I'm sure you know this so maybe you missed the fly in fly out part."]}
