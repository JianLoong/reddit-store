{"id": 25904, "submission_id": "16645vu", "title": "AITA for not helping my family finacially after she made me homeless over a cat?", "selftext": "My sister and I grew up in poverty, were homeless as kids, and never were taught how to manage money or make it last. When we were adults we got jobs and moved in together, I made minimum wage while she made decent money. I would also watch her cat for her when she was at work (worked flyin-fly out). One day we got into an argument because I got accepted for a well paying job that unfortunately meant I also would not be home for a couple days at a time, she lost it and said if i couldnt take care of her cat then I had to leave or pay all the rent so she could hire a cat sitter. She then threatened me with violence and getting rid of all my belongings if I didnt go immediately. So I was made homeless in the middle of winter, luckily I was able to crash on my friends couch until I saved up for a new place. A couple months later my sister and I talked and she apologized, I accepted the apology but our relationship hasn't been the same. now its been about 3 years since then. My sister called and said that she has missed a lot of work due to this or that and needed help with money for rent, I paid her rent because even though she made me homeless I dont want her to go through that. Now a month later she called again and is asking for more money and is promising to eventually pay it back. I honestly have little trust that she will because she never learned to manage money. I told her that the position she put me in sucks because she literally made me homeless and didnt care about my financial struggle at all when I had nothing. \nShe said she didn't know what to say because I was right and it was shitty of her. I feel bad because I hate hurting people and I know how bad the price of living is right now. So AITA for not helping my sister finacially?\n\nEdit: I forgot to add that from the outside her life doesn't look great at the moment, and appears to be falling apart. I feel like she may do something super drastic to herself if she loses her place because she is very impulsive and has a history of depression. So yeah I feel like im in a very tight spot.", "created_utc": 1693466748, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16645vu/aita_for_not_helping_my_family_finacially_after/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My question is would she of apologised for what she did if she if she didn't need the money?", "NTA you have already helped her (which is more than she did for you!) and if you keep helping her she could end up taking advantage. Personally I would think about helping her with her finances and see if she could afford to pay you back if you lend it. Make sure you get any agreement about money in writing to cover yourself if it does go sour.", "I\u2019m sorry but you owe her nothing. And as long as you continue to support her, she\u2019s going to continue to ask. I have been in similar circumstances. You need to remember you were homeless. She kicked YOU out. Hell no!! You don\u2019t go \u2018 oh well, she\u2019s struggling, I will help\u2019  it was her decision, so it\u2019s her problem", "NTA. She's not going to pay back what she owes you- and it sounds like if you keep bailing her out she's going to keep asking for more. Yes, costs are high, but she's going to have to work out a way to manage on what she gets- just like you did.", "NTA also, INFO: Why does your sister\u2019s cat need constant attention and care?  Cats are pretty self-sufficient?  Just throw down some food, water, and a clean litter box, and they\u2019ll be ok for a couple of days.", "Nop, easlily NTA. Your sister is selfish and you know it, rent is not something only she has.", "NTA. She will never learn to stand on her own two feet if you keep propping her up.

You don't owe her anything.  Stop giving her money, it's only encouraging her to ask for more.

U need to cut her off make an excuse u got bit bill soon. \"Car needs repairing\" etc and remember u don't owe her anything", "She apologized a long time before asking, but the apology was mostly her blaming her boyfriend at the time ( i guess he didnt like cats and refused to watch it for her while she worked) and work stress. She never did take accountability for what she directly did.", "I hired a \"cat sitter\" because I'll be gone for 2 days and my cats will eat through their food if I leave 2 days worth of food out.
