When we were adults we got jobs and moved in together, I made minimum wage while she made decent money. I would also watch her cat for her when she was at work (worked flyin-fly out). One day we got into an argument because I got accepted for a well paying job that unfortunately meant I also would not be home for a couple days at a time, she lost it and said if i couldnt take care of her cat then I had to leave or pay all the rent so she could hire a cat sitter. She then threatened me with violence and getting rid of all my belongings if I didnt go immediately. So I was made homeless in the middle of winter, luckily I was able to crash on my friends couch until I saved up for a new place. A couple months later my sister and I talked and she apologized, I accepted the apology but our relationship hasn't been the same. now its been about 3 years since then. My sister called and said that she has missed a lot of work due to this or that and needed help with money for rent, I paid her rent because even though she made me homeless I dont want her to go through that. Now a month later she called again and is asking for more money and is promising to eventually pay it back. I honestly have little trust that she will because she never learned to manage money. I told her that the position she put me in sucks because she literally made me homeless and didnt care about my financial struggle at all when I had nothing. \nShe said she didn't know what to say because I was right and it was shitty of her. I feel bad because I hate hurting people and I know how bad the price of living is right now. So AITA for not helping my sister finacially?\n\nEdit: I forgot to add that from the outside her life doesn't look great at the moment, and appears to be falling apart. I feel like she may do something super drastic to herself if she loses her place because she is very impulsive and has a history of depression.

You don't owe her anything.  Stop giving her money, it's only encouraging her to ask for more.

This help will come in the form of going to /r/personalfinance and figuring out her budget and what is going wrong. It can involve you finding resources like local counselors and 1-800 help numbers.\n\nShe tried to bully and threaten you and doesn\u2019t deserve your assistance. However, she did apologize in advance so you need to tell her, \u201chey sis, you want my help. I don\u2019t think that throwing money at the problem will help.

She's not blaming the boyfriend, she's saying there's nothing she can think of to excuse her actions and it was her bad behaviour at fault.\n\nIf you want something more from her, have a conversation about your expectations. If I apologised to someone, they said they accepted my apology and still wanted a relationship with me, I'd think the issue was dealt with and learn from my screwup. On the other side, when I truly accept an apology I don't bring that subject up again.\n\nIf you don't think you'll ever be able to look past her past behaviour, be honest and tell her that. Then you all know where you stand in your relationship.\n\nIf it's a financial concern ask for a written payment plan. Something small and manageable. Set it up as a standing order.

Yes you might not get your money back, but it would be a good thing to do...\n\nNTA", "NTA It is not your responsibility to maker her responsible or cover for her when she decides not to be. You say the problems stem from not managing money. She knows damn well, as does everyone everywhere, bills need to be paid. Rent gets paid or you get evicted. If she choses not to either from gambling, spending, or just thinking she can con you into paying for her then that is her problem. You continuing to pay isn't getting her anywhere but it would be getting her a free ride to keep doing it.", "NTA. Her emergency is not yours.", "NTA. It sounds like both of you are struggling in different ways with the burdens your parents placed on you as children. You aren\u2019t obligated to extend help to her after the way she treated you, but it does sound like you still have a lot of emotional ties to her, and that does make it very complicated. You\u2019ll have to decide if the feeling you get is worth paying money in that you do not think will be paid back. \n\nEven if her boyfriend was a motivating factor behind her actions, she needs to take responsibility for them. It\u2019s important to you being able to find an emotional resolution. My mother tried to find other things to blame for her actions and it poisoned our relationship.", "NTA. She picked a CAT over you. I think you really need to let that sink in. It doesn\u2019t matter that she said I am sorry that means nothing without action behind it and from this post and some of your comments it doesn\u2019t sound like she has put any actual actions to show how sorry she truly is. You have already done enough and have supported her way more than she did for you. You shouldn\u2019t feel bad about not paying for her rent because she literally did not care if you were homeless so why should you.

And let\u2019s not even get started on kids.\n\nBut cats? super easy.", "This. My partner and I have had several cats over the years, both before we got together and since. So long as you leave enough water out - we leave several bowls around the house - a full bowl of food - or a timed automatic feeder - and a clean litter box, cats are fine for at least 3 or 4 days at a time on their own. When we\u2019ve traveled for longer durations, we\u2019ve had friends check in on the cat(s) every 3 days or so (more often if they want extra cat time, or if we have a streaming service that they don\u2019t). \n\nAnd yeah, dogs are a different issue completely; ours gets walked twice a day, is never left home alone for more than ~10 hours; if we\u2019re gone longer than that, we usually board him, so that our friends don\u2019t have the hassle of walking him.", "Because it's a living creature, and they should at least get checked on daily to make sure they aren't sick, hurt, lonely or in need of food, water and a clean litter box.", "Accepting an apology doesn't mean they won't do the same thing again. And it also doesn't mean for you to forget those actions.  Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me.\nSure I can forgive someone but that doesn't mean I have to trust them again.", "Your automatic feeder sucks if it also can't handle a kid or two.", "Cats should never be left alone for three or more days, saying that they will be fine for \"at least three or four days on their own\" is totally negligent. Here in Norway, cats have to get checked on at least every 24h by law, because they are living creatures. They can get hurt, they can get sick, they can get lonely. People who get cats thinking it's okay to just leave them alone for days at the time should never be allowed to have them.", "And that's fine if that's what you want to do. But it's important to be real with the people around you about your expectations in a relationship. \n\nI wouldn't want to sustain relationships I couldn't trust in. If I accepted an apology but didn't forgive to the point of trust, I wouldn't want to keep that person in my life. If they had to be in my life, I would let them know my limits so we could all manage our expectations for the relationship.\n\nForgiveness doesn't mean forgetting. I haven't forgotten some bad things people have done in my life. But when I believe they are truly sorry and make steps to change their behaviour, I'm good with that. I think the world would be a sorry place to live in if we held everyone's mistakes against them forever, no matter what.", "\ud83d\ude02", "Yes, you are the asshole, especially since u know she is struggling and can hurt herself.", "NTA. Cats don't require the same level of care as, say, a dog. Fill the water. Fill the food bowl (or get an automatic feeder). They're good for a few days. Granted, the litterbox will be the first order of business when she gets home but...wtf.", "NTA\n\nAt the core of what you're asking, even ignoring the various indecencies your sister committed to you in the past, you're basically asking if you'd be the asshole to turn your sister down knowing that you will inevitably be asked again and never see any of what is owed back.  Further, you're effectively asking us if you'd be the asshole to turn her down when you know on some level she's drowning due to her own issues and inadequacies.\n\nMy answer is, \"don't light yourself on fire to keep others warm.\" She's your sister, and I get you want to help her, but there comes a point where your help is just enabling her to continue to spiral. The help she needs is not something you can provide. This woman needs therapy first and foremost, and perhaps some financial literacy courses.", "I think this goes beyond AITA.\n\nWhat she did to you sucked. She did apologise but do you think it was sincere, do you think she changed for a better or do you think she would do the same 3 years later?\n\nDo you love her as a sister, do you care about her presence in your life? Do you think you are better off without her in your life?\n\nIf you have money to help then it's not money issue, it's if you care enough about her to help her and help beyond financial aid but to be there and guide her towards improving her over all situations.\n\nIf you borrow her money set up boundaries, expectations and plan on how she can figure out her life instead of asking you for money every month.\n\nBut if you do not care about her in your life now or in future then she is not your problem and do not lend her that money.", "NTa.  Your sister only reached out when she needed you and did a terrible thing when you legit could not watch the cat those couple of days at a time.\n\nI only worry about the cat - the cat deserves a safe and loving home it's entire life.", "NTA. \n\nYou would not owe her financial help (which you probably will never get paid back) even if she *hadn't* treated you like garbage in the past.", "NTA. Being made homeless for not watching a cat seems very weird. Cats can be left alone for hours on end or even overnight, unlike dogs, since they tend to be independent. I mean, was there something wrong with the cat that required more attention?", "NTA. Do not listen to the commenters saying ''if you care about her, offer her help.'' You can care about her while simultaneously not helping her. You give her the money, God forbid you face some hardships yourself, I guarantee your sister will not help you. That rent money you gave away would've helped you then. It's not like you turned a blind eye to her struggles, you already paid her rent once. \n\nI just want to tell you that don't feel bad that you are hurting her because you're not, you don't owe her anything. In fact, take pride in paying for her rent once, because someone like your sister doesn't deserve any help at all. Always treat people how they treat you. Karma is starting to catch up to her.", "if you are in a positon to help, then do it, but make sure its time limited and then stick to that.", "NTA, you have already done more than she did for you. If you say no, there is absolutely no judgement or anything.\n\nIt seems like there is a part of you that still wants to help her. So if you do end up helping, you could sit down with her and in exchange for one final bit of help, she has to set a good financial plan. Make sure she knows where every cent is going for the next few months. If she has enough, then you have already helped her and she doesn't need to \"borrow\" money. If she really doesn't have enough, then you can decide if you want to help. But in order to get the help, she has to cut back on every optional expense. No more restaurants, no more clothes, no more alcohol, no more anything that isn't essential to her and her cat living. Only then should you give anything.", "In dysfunctional families, the few members who are wise about money and life are often expected to rescue the others. Ask yourself if you want to be drafted into that role.  Help one and word gets around.\n\nOP Odd Rice is right - require a written repayment schedule if you consider lending money to your sister again.\n\nIf you have it in you to lend her money one more time, consider making it conditional on her taking and completing a course on how to budget and take care of business.  If she's unwilling or unable to do that, it sounds like your sister needs a case manager.", "NTA you already done enough. You accepted the apology and offered some help. Doesn't matter about the market she had to figure it out. You already helped once don't stretch yourself thin trying to pay double rent.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nStop paying for her, she made you homeless and threatened you with violence and you SUPPORT her? Naw.", "OP, call your sister back and explain that you helped her in an emergency but can't do it again. Tell her you can get in contact with homeless shelters or women's shelters if you need the help, and you can give her some guidance and tips because you were where she once was. Hold this boundary or she'll be calling you every month to have her rent paid. She HAS to figure out another solution than you.", "worst take of the day award:", "Instead of paying her rent, could you pay for her to see a financial advisor to help her put together a strategy that could work for her situation? That is a much better way to help your sister long term than a one-time rent payment.", "I\u2019m a pet sitter, and I stopped taking drop in appointments with cats. They were always so fuckin depressed when I\u2019d come by. But then, honestly most cats I meet are depressed and majorly under-socialized.", "Because some cats will passive aggressively pee on things when they haven\u2019t had physical attention in 24hours. They are introverts, but introverts need attention too.", "It says the work is fly in fly out, which means she's not home for days or even weeks at a time.", "Yeah, you can get them for $50 or less. They make them for wet and dry food.", "What would you do if the power went out while you were away? Unless the feeder has a back up battery don't the settings revert to default which means no food comes out. When I check in on my mom's cat while she's away I have to make sure that the feeder is still set properly.", "I'm at home most days, and this is why I found a good cattery for when I go on holiday. It's not a one-size-fits-all situation, but for all that she isn't fond of other cats, my cat certainly prefers going to the familiar cattery once/twice a year with familiar people and annoying feline neighbours to grumble at, than dealing with being left alone and seeing people only once or twice a day.", "Yeah, but\u2026isn\u2019t the sister checking on her cat before she goes to work? And afterwards? \n\nI get it, I ask people to stop by for my cat when I\u2019m out of town even though I know he has plenty of water, a clean box, and that his punk ass knows how to open his food bin if the feeder were to go empty, because he\u2019s very social and loves love. But if it\u2019s just throughout the work day, I don\u2019t see why this would be a necessity?", "Ours actually do have a backup battery. And I honestly don\u2019t worry about it too much because we do have someone come in every couple days, and cats will be fine if they miss a couple meals too. Water I worry about more.", "When we travel, we have a friend come feed the cat dinner and hang out with them for a couple hours. He loves cats and doesn't have his own, and the cat loves him, win-win for them!", "Exactly. I was cat sitting one day and was surprised when I wasn't greeted at the door by one of the cats. Somehow the door of a small room had managed to close behind him and he was stuck in there for who knows how long with no food, water, or litter box. He could not have been there for too long, because there were no \"accidents\" but he was extremely stressed at not being able to get out. Good thing I went by every day. \n\nOur cats follow us from room to room and  are always very close to us. If you close the door on them they will try to tear the down. Whoever says cats are totally independent has either never owned cats or was never a loving pet owner who gave them a lot of love and attention.", "Agreed, isvann! I would never dream of leaving my cat alone for three or four days. He's used to our usual routine and it would really distress him to be left alone for 24 hours, let alone days. \n\nI know that cats differ and some would be fine, but it can't be generalised that all cats are OK alone for days. Alive, probably, but their wellbeing may well be affected. They are more social than people think.", "The sister is away for work for days at the time (fly in fly out job), so getting someone to care for her cat is the one thing she did right in this situation, in my opinion.", "It says the work is fly in fly out, which means she's not home for days or even weeks at a time."]}
