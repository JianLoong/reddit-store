When we were adults we got jobs and moved in together, I made minimum wage while she made decent money. I would also watch her cat for her when she was at work (worked flyin-fly out). One day we got into an argument because I got accepted for a well paying job that unfortunately meant I also would not be home for a couple days at a time, she lost it and said if i couldnt take care of her cat then I had to leave or pay all the rent so she could hire a cat sitter. She then threatened me with violence and getting rid of all my belongings if I didnt go immediately. So I was made homeless in the middle of winter, luckily I was able to crash on my friends couch until I saved up for a new place. A couple months later my sister and I talked and she apologized, I accepted the apology but our relationship hasn't been the same. now its been about 3 years since then. My sister called and said that she has missed a lot of work due to this or that and needed help with money for rent, I paid her rent because even though she made me homeless I dont want her to go through that. Now a month later she called again and is asking for more money and is promising to eventually pay it back. I honestly have little trust that she will because she never learned to manage money. I told her that the position she put me in sucks because she literally made me homeless and didnt care about my financial struggle at all when I had nothing. \nShe said she didn't know what to say because I was right and it was shitty of her. I feel bad because I hate hurting people and I know how bad the price of living is right now. So AITA for not helping my sister finacially?\n\nEdit: I forgot to add that from the outside her life doesn't look great at the moment, and appears to be falling apart. I feel like she may do something super drastic to herself if she loses her place because she is very impulsive and has a history of depression. So yeah I feel like im in a very tight spot.", "created_utc": 1693466748, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16645vu/aita_for_not_helping_my_family_finacially_after/", "score": 117, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My question is would she of apologised for what she did if she if she didn't need the money?", "NTA you have already helped her (which is more than she did for you!) and if you keep helping her she could end up taking advantage. Personally I would think about helping her with her finances and see if she could afford to pay you back if you lend it. Make sure you get any agreement about money in writing to cover yourself if it does go sour.", "I\u2019m sorry but you owe her nothing. And as long as you continue to support her, she\u2019s going to continue to ask. I have been in similar circumstances. You need to remember you were homeless. She kicked YOU out. Hell no!! You don\u2019t go \u2018 oh well, she\u2019s struggling, I will help\u2019  it was her decision, so it\u2019s her problem", "NTA. She's not going to pay back what she owes you- and it sounds like if you keep bailing her out she's going to keep asking for more. Yes, costs are high, but she's going to have to work out a way to manage on what she gets- just like you did.", "NTA also, INFO: Why does your sister\u2019s cat need constant attention and care?  Cats are pretty self-sufficient?  Just throw down some food, water, and a clean litter box, and they\u2019ll be ok for a couple of days.", "Nop, easlily NTA. Your sister is selfish and you know it, rent is not something only she has.", "NTA. She will never learn to stand on her own two feet if you keep propping her up.

You don't owe her anything.  Stop giving her money, it's only encouraging her to ask for more.  She's a user, she doesn't appreciate you or whatever you've done for her in the past, the only thing she cares about is how much you'll give her next.", "NTA\n\nBut I would say, if you do want to repair the relationship with her (IF), maybe offer her a place to stay while she gets back on her feet under your terms.", "Is your sister doing drugs?", "She doesn't want to change her lifestyle and spending habits. U need to cut her off make an excuse u got bit bill soon. \"Car needs repairing\" etc and remember u don't owe her anything", "She apologized a long time before asking, but the apology was mostly her blaming her boyfriend at the time ( i guess he didnt like cats and refused to watch it for her while she worked) and work stress. She never did take accountability for what she directly did.", "I hired a \"cat sitter\" because I'll be gone for 2 days and my cats will eat through their food if I leave 2 days worth of food out. Otherwise me and the wife are out for 8 hours a day and they don't give a shit.", "Nta - that's a her problem. Not a you problem and she'll just keep calling for more and more.\n\nTell her of she wants to save money find a home for her cat so it doesn't have to suffer her financial issues.", "Best way to help is to take her hand, and show her the ressources that can help for real.  Money isn\u2019t going to show her anything and she won\u2019t learn from begging all the time. If you love your sister and want to get her out of this shit, give her your time, not your money. If she is depressed she needs treatment, maybe a psychologist, it\u2019s called tough love and it only helps if the other person is willing to receive it. Good luck.", "NTA. You already know she would throw you out for a trivial reason.\n\nIf you continue helping her, do so with the full awareness and acceptance that you may never see a dime of it back, and that she is likely to betray you again if the tables are turned.\n\nDon\u2019t think she owes you one, because she might simply think she\u2019s pulled one over you.\n\nPeople say I\u2019m cynical and misanthropic. \ud83e\udd14", "NTA. Even if you 2 had the best relationship, it is not right for you to send her money. This is like when an alcoholic asks for a bottle of vodka. What they are asking for from you and what they need from you are 2 very different things. Tell your sister that you cannot continue to throw money at the problem but you are happy to help her as much as she needs. This help will come in the form of going to /r/personalfinance and figuring out her budget and what is going wrong. It can involve you finding resources like local counselors and 1-800 help numbers.\n\nShe tried to bully and threaten you and doesn\u2019t deserve your assistance. However, she did apologize in advance so you need to tell her, \u201chey sis, you want my help. I don\u2019t think that throwing money at the problem will help. I will fully be here with advice and with resources. If you are hungry you can come over to my house for a meal. My help will not include opening my wallet because I don\u2019t think that will help.\u201d", "NTA", "NTA\n\nTell her to get a roommate or a second job.", "NTA. Your sister is garbage and deserves to be thrown out. Do not give her a dime and go no contact", "Why did someone have to watch the cat? It\u2019s not a baby or even a dog\u2026\n\nEdit: I love cats! I have 2. Which is why I am confused", "You could potentially pay 1 more month if you have it in you and tell her it's a gift and that you won't be able to help next month. You won't get money back from her so just consider it a gift what you gave. It sounds like you want to be the bigger person and she understands what she did was awful and that she isn't just saying that because she needs help now.", "> She said she didn't know what to say because I was right and it was shitty of her.\n\nThis is taking accountability. She's not blaming the boyfriend, she's saying there's nothing she can think of to excuse her actions and it was her bad behaviour at fault.\n\nIf you want something more from her, have a conversation about your expectations. If I apologised to someone, they said they accepted my apology and still wanted a relationship with me, I'd think the issue was dealt with and learn from my screwup. On the other side, when I truly accept an apology I don't bring that subject up again.\n\nIf you don't think you'll ever be able to look past her past behaviour, be honest and tell her that. Then you all know where you stand in your relationship.\n\nIf it's a financial concern ask for a written payment plan. Something small and manageable. Set it up as a standing order. Or decide an amount you don't mind losing and stick to it.", "\"I accepted your apology long ago.  That was personal. Lending you money?  That's business...\"", "NTA- just make sure the cat has food.", "We had the same problem and got an automatic pet feeder, totally solved the issue. Might be worth looking into.", "Yeah, I thought the point of cats was that they normally are pretty self sufficient. At most maybe needed someone to stop by to do meals if they are a strict eaters or something.", "They don't. Sister probably has some issues as a result of their disruptive childhood. I'm a foster parent and many of our kids, including older teens, have had strong overprotective and risk averse behaviours due to lack of stability and support. If not treated that behaviour will continue into adulthood. \n\nThere are mental illnesses where this can be a problem too."]}
