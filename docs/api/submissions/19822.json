After sitting in a crowded, loud conference all day, I just wanted to head back to the hotel and decompress alone. But Beth is an extrovert and begged me to go along with her to the event. I eventually relented and said that I\u2019d go with her for an hour tops. \n\nSo we went and I was 100% ready to leave after an hour. However, at that point, Beth spotted this guy there who\u2019s kind of a big deal/thought leader in our industry (I\u2019ll call him JR), and she wanted to go over and meet him. I didn\u2019t really care about networking with him but I went along with it, figuring that we\u2019d chat with him for 5-10 minutes and then leave.  So we went over and introduced ourselves but then these four other men came over as well (everyone wants to meet JR) and joined in the conversation. \n\nWe were all talking in a small circle, and one of the men who was next to me started a smaller side convo with me. It took me a few minutes to realize that he was trying to flirt with me, and I tried to politely shut it down until he took my arm and gently ran his fingers up and down my forearm. I don\u2019t think anyone else was really paying attention because they were all eating up everything JR was saying. I pulled away from the creepy guy and asked Beth if I could speak to her privately. \n\nI told her that the guy was making me uncomfortable and that I wasn\u2019t going to stay. She totally disregarded my feelings and said \u201coh, he was probably just being friendly, it\u2019s a networking event!\u201d I told her how I didn\u2019t feel safe with him around and she asked me to stay for ten more minutes so that she could pick JR\u2019s brain about something. \n\nI told her that I\u2019d wait ten more minutes but that was it, and I wasn\u2019t going to rejoin the conversation because the creepy guy was there. Instead, I sat down on a bench outside the restrooms and was catching up on emails. After 10 minutes I texted Beth \u201cready to go?\u201d but she didn\u2019t respond. Then the creepy dude found me and tried to talk to me again, so I shut him down, texted Beth \u201cCreepy dude is bugging me again, I\u2019m grabbing an Uber back to the hotel, see you later,\u201d and left. \n\nAn hour and a half later I was in my pajamas in my hotel room when Beth responded \u201cWTF, thanks for leaving me alone in a strange city\u201d and I responded that I\u2019d told her repeatedly how uncomfortable I was and that she ignored my texts.  She said she\u2019d been deep in conversation with JR so I should\u2019ve just come over to tell her, and I said that I\u2019d told her ten minutes and texted her twice. And that it took her 90 minutes to even notice I was gone so she must not have felt TOO alone. Then I told her I was going to bed. \n\nIt\u2019s the next morning and we\u2019re both currently in an Uber from the hotel to the conference hall for the final sessions. Beth is being very cold and has barely spoken to me this morning. I\u2019m pissed too, but am trying to remain professional.", "created_utc": 1686917575, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14av8s3/aita_for_leaving_a_networking_event_without_my/", "score": 216, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ignore her gaslighting. You felt you were in an unsafe situation, you removed yourself from it and gave her plenty of opportunity to leave with you.", "NTA. If someone is making you feel unsafe and the person you are with isn't helping at all, then you do what you can to make yourself safe.

You clearly communicated your boundaries to Beth, and she chose to ignore them.", "NTA. She pushed your boundaries incessantly. After pressuring you to go to an event you didn't want to go to, the least she could have done was honor your one-hour time limit.

This dude made you uncomfortable and your safety is the priority.

She obviously does not care for you. Do the same. Stay safe!", "NTA. If you felt creeped out you had every right to leave.

And you did way more than what was necessary considering the situation.", "NTA\n\nYou told her your plans she ignored them.\n\nSorry you had to deal with creepy guy. \n\n>WTF, thanks for leaving me alone in a strange city\n\nYour friend literally did this to you.", "NTA. Beth completely ignored and disregarded your feelings, so you did what you felt like was necessary for your safety. If she was so worried about being alone in a strange city, why didn't she care more when you told her that you felt uncomfortable??", "NTA, and as the extrovert coworker at networking, I often tell my coworkers they can leave whenever and I can stay. Now i get annoyed when they refuse my statement and stay cause I am woman in different city. \n\nNeither of you are in the wrong for how you view the networking event but you both need to be able to handle your own choices at it, which you did, she is not taking ownership that her extrovert recharge was not complete while your introvert recharge was wiped out", "NTA You two are there for work. You made it clear to her that you wouldn't be at the event for long and you kept her informed of what you intended to do. She ignored you when you said you were leaving. She is a grown adult and is capable of returning to the hotel by herself from a professional networking event. It's not like you left her drunk and vulnerable at a club.", "NTA\n\nEven if you have left w/o telling her after the first hour and only shoot her a text so she isn't looking for you, you would still be NTA . This is a work event and you are not your coworkers babysitter, so there was no need to stay together in the first place. \n\nIf she can't manage to go to the hotel herself, well, she can't participate in work events with overnight stay. Period.", "NTA - Beth is a coworker, not a friend. There\u2019s no reason that you need to be in each other\u2019s pockets at a business event. It\u2019s fine if she stays and you leave. \n\nShe has shown that she isn\u2019t concerned about you so don\u2019t be concerned about her. Pretend that she\u2019s just another person at the conference and ignore her.", "NTA - I\u2019m Beth a conferences, I want to go to the events and mingle and talk to people because I like it. I also have/had coworkers that pretty much only go to conferences when/if they have to. At one company I was the go to person for conferences because its so natural for me and k really shine. My coworkers that were more introverted usually joined for part of the event and then would leave if they wanted/needed to. \n\nConferences can be EXHAUSTING for everyone and moreso for introverts. Add on to it, a conference participant making you uncomfortable, you were more than right to leave. Beth is a bit of an AH here for not acknowledging that you were uncomfortable and disregarding your needs. To me, that should negate her networking and her focus should have been on figuring out the best solution for you, even if it was ultimately still she stays/you go.", "NTA. And I'm amazed at her being upset at you leaving her alone in a strange city - not a good thing, sure, but a hypothetical danger - when you were escaping a bad situation that was actually happening right then and there. It's like being upset that you use the fire extinguisher to stop a fire, because what if she needs it later?", "NTA\u2026.even without the creeper, you told Beth you were only staying so long.  She is an adult.  She has choices.  Her choice was to ignore you and your boundaries and do what she wanted.  If it was that important to her, she would have left with you.  Apparently it was not.", "NTA  SHE left YOU ALONE! She knew you were creeped out by a man in the talk circle and were being harassed. You told her when he found you a second time. You could have been a victim of a SA. Screw her and her ladder climbing blindness.", "Honestly, Beth didn\u2019t even have to leave. OP needs to change how she views attending the conference. They don\u2019t have to do everything together.", "Beth sure DOES care, but only for controlling her colleague by gaslighting and manipulating. Beth is probably on a fast track to becoming a CEO, e.g., meeting the right people at the conference, practicing her techniques and all \ud83d\ude04", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe her sh\u2026 nothing.\n\nShe disregarded, dismissed and denied anything you said, honestly a less polite or simply more assertive person would have told her she was on her own Way before you left.", "NTA - she's an adult, I would think she's capable of getting her own Uber to the hotel and capable of being a professional. She honestly sounds childish. You did the right thing getting out of there before Creep decided to push more, and you were tired anyways! She decided to ignore your boundaries, that's on her.", "You need to take this to HR as soon as you get back to your home office. NTA", "how old is she that you have to be a wing-man for her to socialize ?  nta , but you should have left after the first hour. alone in a strange city ?  how strange ?  zombies running about ? apocalyptic ? i travel alone and i have never been in a city i found so strange i couldn\u2019t deal with it on my own.", "NTA. And frankly, she was at a networking event surrounded by professionals in a major city, with easy access to an Uber directly from point A to point B, where there would inevitably be a doorman outside of her hotel. \n\nNever leave a drunk woman to walk home alone at night, but she\u2019s an adult. She needs to feel comfortable in some situations, and this is definitely as minimally risky as they come, especially with all the tracking options added into Uber now. You didn\u2019t leave her on the side of the road with a dead phone, you left her in the company of plenty of other professionals in a well-lit, well-populated place with plenty of transportation options all with decent monitoring AND you told her you were leaving. She doesn\u2019t get to pull the \u201cyou left a woman in an unsafe situation!!\u201d Card, when she did exactly that to you.", "NTA. Just because you are colleagues it doesn\u2019t mean you have to be superglued together at a conference. You are not Siamese twins. She can network all she want - alone.", "NTA.  Like at all.  You repeatedly told her you were leaving.  You took an Uber back to the hotel; it's not like you took off in a shared rental car and abandoned her.\n\nHonestly, all the stuff about creepy guy isn't even relevant to the judgement (obviously it's relevant to you that it happened, and I am sorry you had to deal with that, it sucks).  But whether it was a creepy dude, a stomach ache, or just plain being ready to go -- you had every right to peace out back to the hotel.  You did her the courtesy of telling her you were leaving, and the courtesy of telling her you had in fact left.  You were more than gracious about it.", "NTA, at all.", "NTA - She doesn't give a crap about your safety or feeling.", "NTA - Beth needs to grow up. You can leave out everything about creepy stranger, introvet versus extrovert, etc. The fact is, you said you'd stay an hour and she agreed but broke her agreement.\n\nIf your company thinks you are old enough and mature enough to be sent to the conference, then you need to act that way. I talk frankly with Beth. I'd say \"last night didn't go as planned, but if we let it affect the way we do our jobs, it is going to reflect poorly on both of us. We don't want this to get back to the company and have them think we can't be sent on future trips.\" Notice that the phrase doesn't say you're right and she's wrong - leave that part out. If she tries to do so, say \"some will agree with you and some with me - but if we go that route, others will just see both of us as unprofessional.\" If it gets back and people start asking, take the high road - you'll look better. Say there was a miscommunication on the ride back, but you both just took Ubers, so no big deal. The most I'd say is that you were ready to leave after 1 hour but Beth was having such a good time she decided to stay for three hours, so you took separate ubers, no big deal.", "NTA and newsflash: Beth is an awful colleague", "good job, she probably wont try that again", "NTA."]}
