On a holiday weekend  I (f30) and my family  went to a family party at MIL house. I was talking to another family member about my IUD placement  that was place 1 day prior and how I was in pain  and  que SIL (f30)     not apart of the conversation  asked   why do you have and IUD and I turn and tell her because I don't want to have another kid.  Side note : MY pregnancy was deliver  were traumatic and SIL knows this.     And I resume  conversation with other family member   and I tell the family member that I'm in a lot of pain que SIL again   but  why would you get and IUD if your husband had a Vasectomy. I turn and say Vasectomy are not 100% effective and I resume conversation again with other family members.   After another minute or two   SIL   asked   but  if he had his check  6 weeks after and it showed no working guys then you are good   and  I respond back with   yes   but  there is still a chance and  I also  want to level out my hormone issues  because I moved from Birth control pills to the IUD .    So  not once not twice but three times I have responded to SIL questions.   I resume conversation with family member thinking g SIL was done asking  I was wrong she asked again but    You  don't need an IUD if he had the Vasectomy   and I snapped and said MY husband is not the only man who fucks me  and  SIL    goes ohh well then  and  turns around  and walks away.   AITA  for  snapping at my SIL  when she asked 4 times why I had an IUD  \n\n  Edit:     I was having a private conversation with my other SIL   who   asked me  directly about why I looked like I was in so much pain and I explained to her   and  SIL    cam  up at the end and Heard IUD    as well as those who are asking      My husband and I are In the Lifestyle   so my husband very much knows    I have been with other women and men. He has also been with other women.        The Other SIL (other family member)  knew  of lifestyle.", "created_utc": 1675095873, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10p6yjb/aita_snapped_at_sil_after_the_4th_time/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not sure how id feel as your husband if my sister came and told me you said that", "NTA \nYou could have handled it better but when your in pain that can be hard. \n\nYour SIL on the other hand completely failed to get a clue that you weren\u2019t talking with her and failed to respect that birth control is personal.", "[removed]", "NTA. Vasectomy's fail. It's a small risk but it does happen.  But it's also your body and your choice how to protect it.  2 forms of control are better than one.", "NTA she was being intrusive. Vasectomies are not 100% and, rarely, can reverse. She kept being nosy and found out more than she probably wanted to know. That's her fault.", "Well, that escalated quickly.  You're NTA for getting upset with your sister-in-law for continuing to push the issue after you had already responded to her 3 times but, I wonder, if what you say is true that your husband is not the only one you are sleeping with, if sis-in-law was aware of this previously and was trying to get you to react the way you did by outing yourself to the entire family.  Either way, it's none of sis-in-law's business what you do with your body.", "NTA. It's really none of her business why you have an IUD and it was wrong of her to pry.", "NTA, she was being intrusive and got involved in a conversation she wasn't invited into. You should have told the scientist to mind her own business. Your response was quite funny.", "ESH\n\nShe rudely pried, and apparently your idea of turning the tables is yelling about how you're cheating on your husband.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>  \n>  \n> I snapped and said MY husband is not the only man who fucks me", "Am I the only one wondering who the other guy is?", "NTA. SIL shouldn\u2019t have intruded into your conversation even the first time.", "Yikes", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSIL is right with the vasectomy ... but your IUD is NONE of her business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" So not once not twice but three times I have responded to SIL questions\" .. FAR to polite.", "Because they weren't really interested in anything other than getting sympathy for their pain. \n\nBut yup, pretty aggressive.", "She was talking to a specific person, that doesn't give SIL Any indication that they can bud in the conversation", "Listen to the proctologist^", "She said the family was already aware of the lifestyle they live, including the SIL. She handled it just fine, imho", "In addition, OP kept answering her questions so she kept asking more. If OP doesn\u2019t want more questions, just shut them down (I guess in a way she did lol).", "What are you talking about? IUD does not stop periods, especially completely. You don't know what you're talking about", "Okay    Let me educate you!    AN  IUD  can help  balance out estrogen and progesterone  in the body.", "Really, intrusive? For a public conversation?", "Wondering about the efficacy of airing yourself out like that at a family gathering though", "Being in an open relationship isn\u2019t cheating. Update your puritanical views and realize there are other options for people than strict monogamy", "I am not cheating. We  have an open marriage.", "Why? They\u2019re in an open relationship and happy with it. My wife and I are as well and it works very well for us and has brought us closer together than we ever were before. It doesn\u2019t matter who \u201cthe other guy\u201d is.", "What\u2019s that got to do with it? They\u2019re in an open relationship.", "Then the correct response is '\"Do you mind? I'm having a private conversation with my friend. Please give us privacy.\"\n\nIt can be done politely. It doesn't need to be so aggressive and hostile.\n\nHowever, I still think OP is not entitled to privacy in a public setting. If she doesn't want people joining in, she should talk in a private setting.", "She kept answering and was having an active discussion with another family member about her IUD. SIL probably just thought it was the topic that was up for discussion at that time and was truly interested, albeit a bit nosy and pushy. OP's answer shut her up in that moment, but I am sure the conversation regarding this is far from over now!", "So you just aren\u2019t rude to your SIL but also strangers. Noted. \n\nAnd let me educate you, it depends on the IUD you get which will impact your hormones. \n\nAnd by the way, if you feel the need to exclude people from public conversations please learn to have private one, you give off the mean girl vibes of \u201cyou can\u2019t sit at our table\u201d\n\nYTA only because your attitude sucks.", "[removed]", "Yeah. \"Why did you have this medical procedure?\" is an intrusive question and was none of SIL's business.", "That depends on how the OP feels about the family knowing she's not monogamous. It was rude for the SIL to keep pressing something that wasn't her business.", "Noooo....\nAn IUD prevents a fertilized egg from implanting. There are some that are hormonal for extra protection, but even those don't \"stop your hormonal cycle\" the way the DEPO shot does. Could you please link us to your medical degree? Or quit giving unsolicited, uninformed medical advice?", "You're giving medical advice that you aren't qualified to give here. You, a stranger, don't know anything about OP's hormones. OP could be getting plenty of nutrients, minerals, and vitamins, and still have a condition like endometriosis. The most common method of treating less severe cases of endo is hormonal birth control, which includes hormonal IUDs.", "Hahahhahhahahaha.", ">you need nutrients, minerals, vitamins\n\nOmg, what next? Essential oils?", "Yeah then have private conversations not in public setting where you are purposely being a bully by excluding someone who is literally sitting next to you.", "Sure, SIL\u2019s annoying and all but seems like bringing even more nuisance upon OP & her husband to put that out in the wild", "[removed]", "[removed]", "I have a feeling OP would have been open to discussing the procedure with her SIL, just not the why of the procedure. She'd already answered the why with \"vasectomies are not always 100%\". Calling this bullying is a stretch.", "Could be that OP's revelation will curtail other intrusive questions because the questioner won't want to find out the kind of information OP is willing to share.", "It still doesn't stop periods. You know nothing. Are you even a woman?", "\u2026 it doesn\u2019t stop your periods. No birth control 100% does that. It varies with the individual. Some get lesser periods, some have their periods stop and some periods get so much worse. \n\nStop being so condescending to OP and everyone else that calls out your baseless and factually wrong claims.", "I'm sorry that you think medicine is \"pill popping Band-Aids\" and I hope if you have children that they're actually getting medical care as opposed to just vitamins. Good luck to you.", "Based on how OP responds to comments, I wouldn\u2019t put it that far off from bullying.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s normal to ask why you choose to do something that doesn\u2019t make sense. If you don\u2019t want to have a discussion about it, take it to a private room.", "Maybe but it seems unlikely that SIL is keeping that answer to herself, intentionally or not", "[removed]", "Sounds like OP isn't shy about that since she said the person she was talking to knew she and her husband aren't monogamous. If you were in this situation, I think that you would very much want to keep that information private. I think OP may not feel the same way about it.", "If you have a less intrusive way of treating endometriosis than hormonal birth control, or can identify \"the root cause,\" please let me and the entire medical world know."]}
