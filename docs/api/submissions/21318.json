And it's coming up in September. I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I figured i was only asked as a courtesy since I'm her soon to be sister in law but I still took it seriously. I have been a bridesmaid for the last two years. Just a few weeks ago I managed to save up to buy the 800 dollar bridesmaid dress. Over all in the last two years between group outings to parties, dinners,  lunches, clothes, etc\u2026 I spent thousands of dollars. Eventually all the girls in the wedding and I became extremely close and I started to get hyped for the wedding. \n\nSarah recently got close with her brother's wife Becky (30f). Last week she dropped the ball on me that she no longer wants me to be a bridesmaid and she would prefer if Becky would take my place. \n\nIt broke my heart a little but it's her wedding and it's not my place to tell her how to run it so I said it was fine. Yesterday I went to my brother's house to pick up the bridesmaid's dress, and was going to see if I could return it since it was within the time frame. \n\nSarah was completely appalled and said that Becky was going to wear it since she and I are the same size. \n\nI said that would be fine, but they would have to pay me the 800 for it. Sarah said that Becky couldn't afford and I should just be nice and let her use it and said that I could keep it after the wedding. \n\nI explained that I'm not just giving away the dress, and I'm not ever going to usei after the wedding. After some bickering back and forth I just ended up taking it and leaving.  \n\nMy brother and Sarah tried to compromise with me, and say I could be \"the assistant flower girl\" and I felt offended at the offer. After I said no, they then said that Becky could give me 250 bucks for it. Again no and I returned the dress and got a full refund. \n\n I told them I understand that it's their wedding but they are being extremely disrespectful to me and I don't need to deal with it and I'm not going to the wedding.\n\nToday my coworker says she has an extra round trip plane ticket to go to Miami that she'll sell to me for half price plus I would have to pay for half the hotel and I can go hang out with her in Florida. The only downside is that I'll be in Florida for the week of my brother's wedding. \n\nSo will I be the asshole if I just go party in miami instead of going to my brother's wedding?", "created_utc": 1688488735, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14qk4c9/wibta_if_i_go_on_vacation_instead_of_my_brothers/", "score": 17295, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Okay\u2026\n\nLater fianc\u00e9 decides he wants his brother too after all, and wants her other sister that **he\u2019s** pretty close with to even out the numbers because BIL (her husband) is officiating the wedding and family is just SO important to him. THEN he decides that his sisters are disappointed that his brother and her siblings are in the wedding, so NOW apparently it was fine that there are two groomsmen and four bridesmaids?? At this point I\u2019m annoyed but still planning on coming to the wedding because I know he\u2019s reeeeally close with his family.\n\nMeanwhile, bestie\u2019s lovely roommate is basically doing all the bridesmaid-type duties because bestie\u2019s MOH sister (and I) are still in another country, her other sister has two young kids, and fianc\u00e9\u2019s sisters are useless. Then a couple months before the wedding I find out that fianc\u00e9 has decided that since roomie was so very helpful throughout (and is now engaged to the best man!) she has been added to the wedding party which is now 2-5. And she is still expecting me to come early and help as if I was a bridesmaid but not actually be one. In the end I was like fuck it and told them \u201csorry, I can\u2019t afford it, I\u2019m not coming.\u201d He clearly disliked me and forced me out with excuses and she let him go along with it.

From the fickleness with which she treats this whole situation, my bet is she won't be friends with her in a few years anyway, given how quickly she went from stranger to bridesmaid (granted, she's also family).

Whether justified or not, I'm guessing they won't be too happy, and your other family members will probably give you grief over it. It sounds like you're at a point where you're prepared to burn that familial bridge, but when your parents pass away and if there's some kind of estate to bicker over, you can bet this will be raised again.
