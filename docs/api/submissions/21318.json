And it's coming up in September. I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I figured i was only asked as a courtesy since I'm her soon to be sister in law but I still took it seriously. I have been a bridesmaid for the last two years. Just a few weeks ago I managed to save up to buy the 800 dollar bridesmaid dress. Over all in the last two years between group outings to parties, dinners,  lunches, clothes, etc\u2026 I spent thousands of dollars. Eventually all the girls in the wedding and I became extremely close and I started to get hyped for the wedding. \n\nSarah recently got close with her brother's wife Becky (30f). Last week she dropped the ball on me that she no longer wants me to be a bridesmaid and she would prefer if Becky would take my place. \n\nIt broke my heart a little but it's her wedding and it's not my place to tell her how to run it so I said it was fine. Yesterday I went to my brother's house to pick up the bridesmaid's dress, and was going to see if I could return it since it was within the time frame. \n\nSarah was completely appalled and said that Becky was going to wear it since she and I are the same size. \n\nI said that would be fine, but they would have to pay me the 800 for it. Sarah said that Becky couldn't afford and I should just be nice and let her use it and said that I could keep it after the wedding. \n\nI explained that I'm not just giving away the dress, and I'm not ever going to usei after the wedding. After some bickering back and forth I just ended up taking it and leaving.  \n\nMy brother and Sarah tried to compromise with me, and say I could be \"the assistant flower girl\" and I felt offended at the offer. After I said no, they then said that Becky could give me 250 bucks for it. Again no and I returned the dress and got a full refund. \n\n I told them I understand that it's their wedding but they are being extremely disrespectful to me and I don't need to deal with it and I'm not going to the wedding.\n\nToday my coworker says she has an extra round trip plane ticket to go to Miami that she'll sell to me for half price plus I would have to pay for half the hotel and I can go hang out with her in Florida. The only downside is that I'll be in Florida for the week of my brother's wedding. \n\nSo will I be the asshole if I just go party in miami instead of going to my brother's wedding?", "created_utc": 1688488735, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14qk4c9/wibta_if_i_go_on_vacation_instead_of_my_brothers/", "score": 3447, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The time comes she gets engaged and I\u2019m like \u201cI don\u2019t care if I\u2019m MOH or bridesmaid, just excited for you.\u201d She was happy (sister was MOH, I would be bridesmaid, she had to figure out the rest) and then a few weeks later tells me that her husband-to-be has just one groomsman and he wants the sides to be even so I\u2019m not a bridesmaid officially but I could still fly out early and help her as if I was. Okay\u2026\n\nLater fianc\u00e9 decides he wants his brother too after all, and wants her other sister that **he\u2019s** pretty close with to even out the numbers because BIL (her husband) is officiating the wedding and family is just SO important to him. THEN he decides that his sisters are disappointed that his brother and her siblings are in the wedding, so NOW apparently it was fine that there are two groomsmen and four bridesmaids?? At this point I\u2019m annoyed but still planning on coming to the wedding because I know he\u2019s reeeeally close with his family.\n\nMeanwhile, bestie\u2019s lovely roommate is basically doing all the bridesmaid-type duties because bestie\u2019s MOH sister (and I) are still in another country, her other sister has two young kids, and fianc\u00e9\u2019s sisters are useless. Then a couple months before the wedding I find out that fianc\u00e9 has decided that since roomie was so very helpful throughout (and is now engaged to the best man!) she has been added to the wedding party which is now 2-5. And she is still expecting me to come early and help as if I was a bridesmaid but not actually be one. In the end I was like fuck it and told them \u201csorry, I can\u2019t afford it, I\u2019m not coming.\u201d He clearly disliked me and forced me out with excuses and she let him go along with it. There was no way I was going to attend and be disrespected like that.", "Well yeah but op can keep it after the wedding is over! /s", "Hell, that's more than some people spend on their actual wedding dresses!", "My wedding dress was only slightly more than that. The SIL is a bit of an asshole just for that alone imo.", "Exactly my thought- they already burned the bridge. I wouldn\u2019t want anything to do with them after being used and treated like this. I cut out toxic people from my life- I don\u2019t care if they are family.", "They will come back when they have something else they need OP for, like baby sitting in a couple of years.", "She\u2019s lucky she got back over the bridge just slightly singed", "Yep. They burned the bridge, and the detour goes through Miami.", "I'd be wearing that damn dress all over the beach too!", "Instead of esh, how about Justified AH. Saw that earlier today and it's great", "Yeah flaunting it would be nice and what they deserve (and crappy weather on their wedding)", "A title you give an older sister when you want her to babysit her little sister you actually want as the Flowergirl.", "The flower girls babysitter during the reception of course", "Probably a nice word for a makeshift babysitter for the day.", "My mom has been calling Switzerland. She supports me with whatever I plan to do. My brother has been on his brides side, and says I am being childish. \n\nMy co worker is currently trying to convince me to keep my mouth shut about my trip, and then start posting photos of it on my socials an hour before the wedding.", "And needs to come back and update us in September after the wedding and vacation! Need to let us know what the reaction was and how great a time was had on vacay!", "They want her there so their relatives don't spend the whole night asking 'Where's your sister?' They'll probably lie, so if OP has a particularly gossipy cousin she should tell them the truth so they can leak it at the reception.", "This is the way.", "If I had went along with what they were saying I would have lost out on the dress, the refund, the Miami.", "Who says he was in on it?", "My wedding dress only cost $350! How the fuck does a bridesmaid dress cost $800?! Is it diamond-encrusted and spun in gold?", "I\u2019m sad I had to scroll so far down for this comment. Like that\u2019s an insane amount of money for a bridesmaid dress and having the bridesmaids pay it\u2026 I knew I\u2019d be voting NTA as soon as I read that.\n\nBride dictates the exact dress she wants the bridesmaids in, then she should foot the bill.", "Paying $800 even when you ARE a bridesmaid is laughable. Most people expect to spend $250-$300 MAX on a bridesmaid dress. Who asks their bridesmaids to spend $800?!", "Not if I could get the $800 back, which OP did!\n\nNTA, OP. Party it up!", "We are looking into it right now. She's saying worse case scenario, she can just refund the ticket and help me buy a new one in my name.", "This one clearly is not very loving and supportive.", "They downgraded OP from being a bridesmaid and tried to swipe her dress for someone else.\n\nBut her not attending the event in honor of such disrespectful people is going too far huh? Also, the brother and his fiancee clearly do not have any morality so....Moot point.", "I wonder if the Head Flower Girl is by any chance Becky's daughter...", "I\u2019m afraid some crazed brides will see this post & get inspired. We will now be seeing the following roles in a wedding: \n\nOfficial Head Flower Girl\n\nAssistant Flower Girl \n\nJunior Flower Girl \n\nJunior Assistant Flower Girl \n\nSpecial Assistant Flower Girl Petal Tossing \n\nSpecial Assistant Flower Girl Basket Prep", "I\u2019m sure OP would have to babysit all the children that are there.", "Ugh yeah you are probably absolutely right", "\u201cAssistant TO the flower girl.\u201d", "That sounds amazing! I would love to attend a wedding like that.", "I wonder if he\u2019s still around and has the loincloth. I had absolutely zero intention of getting married until right now", "\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c love this", "My husband and I just got married in May. We had a \u201cflower dude\u201d who danced and passed out White Claws and 50ml bottles of alcohol to people. It was the highlight of our wedding.", "Sounds like Portland", "I love the idea of a cocktail cart preceding the bridal party down the aisle.", "A used card if she can find one.  Dollar store card if she can't.", "A 'Congratulations! Hope I can make your next wedding.' would be even better! But I'm petty like that. \ud83d\ude01", "Never saying anything, sending nothing, and just not showing up might be an even better one.", "With the future SILs name misspelled", "Underrated comment", "Yeah, the downgrade is insulting, not the general idea of an adult flowerperson. But I also can't imagine a friend asking that of me. I'm fairly whimsical, they're a bit more prim and proper, haha", "I'm so glad that at the wedding I was just in the dresses were black.  $300 for a dress is something I can afford now, but having a black formal dress is something I may have need for again.", "My wedding dress was less, including alterations \ud83d\ude02", "good for you!!", "It would almost be worth it to go and wear a name tag that says  \u201cAssistant to the flower girl\u201d ha ha", "Assistant (to the) Regional Manager", "I like the way your coworker thinks. Do it lol.", "Your coworker needs to be upgraded to \"great friend with genius ideas\"!", "Not childish enough to think Assistant Flower Girl is a real thing.\n\nGo to Miami.\n\nNTA", "When someone remains neutral, they are silently making a choice. I think in this instance, her being Switzerland, she is, in fact, supporting you. Most stories, the mum would be trying to talk OP into going to save face and  not ruin the party. I see this as low key support for OP.\n\nNTA btw. Fuck em, go to Miami. When will you get a chance at half price tickets again.", "NTA but your brother and FSIL are horrible. Your coworker is my new hero; treat her to a nice adult beverage and blast the joy on social media.", "Your brother thinks he\u2019s got a better chance at getting you to do some placating than he has at getting his lovely bride to pull her lovely head out of her lovely ass.", ">My co worker is currently trying to convince me to keep my mouth shut about my trip, and then start posting photos of it on my socials an hour before the wedding.\n\nI agree with not saying anything beforehand, but I would suggest you be extra extra petty. If the bride and groom are going on honeymoon straight after the wedding, do a photo dump whilst they're travelling....\n\nThat way they can't accuse you of trying to steal the thunder by posting anything before or during the wedding.  You're complying with etiquette and no one can complain about that \ud83d\ude08", "Keep that coworker around - smart person", "This is the way\u2026 tag em in them to", "Your brother should  realize  what an a h his fiance  is being.", "I need update on this \ud83d\ude02", "I get that it\u2019s your brother\u2019s wedding, but I still find it shitty your mom is being neutral about it. I\u2019d have a hard time respecting my future DIL if she pulled some shit like this.", "Your co worker (aka known as the OG gangsta) is spot on with her suggestion", "This!!  What your co worker said is the way!!", ">My mom has been calling Switzerland.\n\nWhy has your mother been calling Switzerland? What's in Switzerland?", "Make sure to post a picture of yourself on the beach with a bouquet of flowers!", "You? childish? lol your brother and his fiancee needs to look in the mirror.\n\nI like the way your coworker thinks, too!", "Parents who refuse to take sides when a sibling is being disrespectful/cruel  to her are in the wrong. Keeping peace by overlooking serious mistreatment in the family is not good parenting.\n\nNTA but your parents behavior is disgraceful.", "Your coworker is amazing.\n\nYour mom is disappointing.", "He might say you're being childish, that's because his soon to be wife keeps his balls in a jar next to her purse.", "If your brother is calling you childish, live up to the label. Tell him he's a doodoo head and post a photo of yourself building sandcastles in Miami.", "NTA and go to Miami.  If you\u2019re close with other bridesmaids let them know how you were replaced so the AH bride can\u2019t spin some kind of bs about it either", "I see. You were not wrong to do what is best for you in this situation.", "So you being the assistant flower girl was conditional to you giving them the $800 dress that you saved up save and paid for which you wouldn't have if it were not for their wedding? Girl, you know it's not you they want in this wedding, it's the dress! Walk out on this shitshow right now and good riddance!", "Unrelated, but my sister had her three bridesmaids wear this lime green dress - since they've been friends since we were single digit ages, I viewed them all like little sisters - so I had to comment that they all looked like lemon lime popsicle sticks. :D", "I work for a travel company. You\u2019ll probably have to pay an administration fee and a name change fee. This will probably be around $100 depending on the airline. I hope you get your vacation! You deserve it!", "There\u2019s quite literally zero information about her parents or other family members in this story.

They met on July 8 and got married on August 8. Their pastor was the father of their commune and the guests were all their hippie friends.

The coworker is the MVP in this story.", "OP needs to get a T-shirt that says \"assistant flower girl\" and wear on her vacation to Miami\nYWNBTA OP, enjoy the trip!", "OP deserves a mom that shows overt support", "LMFAO!!! This is dirty and I love it", "Sounds like the brother didn't just find the red flags... But his dumb ass is waving it around like an RNC attendee....", "Neutrality.", "Neutrality", "It's an expression - she is saying that she is Switzerland in this fight, i.e. not taking sides.", "Yet you still felt compelled to comment that OP should be the better person to towards the two family members that are explicitly mistreating her.\n\nGood thing OP's mom has better judgment than you and your parents.", "Was about to comment that!

Good one!", "How sweet & cool", "\"Glad I didn't need that bridesmaid dress and had 800 to use on something else\" and tag it #assistantflowergirl", "OMG YAAASSSS!", "Shit ill make OP one for free and just pay me for shipping this is epic!", "assistantfloridagirl", "From now on OP shall hashtag everything #afg for assistant flower girl", "I LOVE YOUUUUUUUUU! This is my kinda thread, and your caption was better than the one I said to post!  I feel as if I\u2019ve found my tribe!", "THIIIIISSS WOW"]}
