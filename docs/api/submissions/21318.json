And it's coming up in September. I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I figured i was only asked as a courtesy since I'm her soon to be sister in law but I still took it seriously. I have been a bridesmaid for the last two years. Just a few weeks ago I managed to save up to buy the 800 dollar bridesmaid dress. Over all in the last two years between group outings to parties, dinners,  lunches, clothes, etc\u2026 I spent thousands of dollars. Eventually all the girls in the wedding and I became extremely close and I started to get hyped for the wedding. \n\nSarah recently got close with her brother's wife Becky (30f). Last week she dropped the ball on me that she no longer wants me to be a bridesmaid and she would prefer if Becky would take my place. \n\nIt broke my heart a little but it's her wedding and it's not my place to tell her how to run it so I said it was fine. Yesterday I went to my brother's house to pick up the bridesmaid's dress, and was going to see if I could return it since it was within the time frame. \n\nSarah was completely appalled and said that Becky was going to wear it since she and I are the same size. \n\nI said that would be fine, but they would have to pay me the 800 for it. Sarah said that Becky couldn't afford and I should just be nice and let her use it and said that I could keep it after the wedding. \n\nI explained that I'm not just giving away the dress, and I'm not ever going to usei after the wedding. After some bickering back and forth I just ended up taking it and leaving.  \n\nMy brother and Sarah tried to compromise with me, and say I could be \"the assistant flower girl\" and I felt offended at the offer. After I said no, they then said that Becky could give me 250 bucks for it. Again no and I returned the dress and got a full refund. \n\n I told them I understand that it's their wedding but they are being extremely disrespectful to me and I don't need to deal with it and I'm not going to the wedding.\n\nToday my coworker says she has an extra round trip plane ticket to go to Miami that she'll sell to me for half price plus I would have to pay for half the hotel and I can go hang out with her in Florida. The only downside is that I'll be in Florida for the week of my brother's wedding. \n\nSo will I be the asshole if I just go party in miami instead of going to my brother's wedding?", "created_utc": 1688488735, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14qk4c9/wibta_if_i_go_on_vacation_instead_of_my_brothers/", "score": 268, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can\u2019t believe the nerve of your sister in law. First to insist that her bridesmaids buy such pricey dresses then to expect you to just give yours away after she kicked you out of the bridal party. NTA.", "Oh yea good point, they really were just using OP.\n\nIf it really easy to add another bridesmaid cause there are usually already ushers who can be used to even out the numbers.  \n\nEven adding a personal attendant is easy, and that doesn\u2019t require a specific dress.", "I am appalled at a bridesmaid dress costing $800!", "Right, so the groom's sister is the bridesmaid that gets kicked out of the wedding party? \n\nIt's so rude of them to spring this on you last minute AND have the audacity to ask you to donate a 800 bucks dress to the usurper. Incredibly rude.", "Nah, the reason they didn\u2019t add another bridesmaid is because your dress could fit Becky perfectly for $0.", "Not a family member, but a good female friend of mine asked me to be in their bridal party as a groomsman. I was so happy. But the groom wanted EVERYTHING to be \u2018classy\u2019. I spent over $1200 on the suit rental, bachelor party, gifts, etc. 8 months later they got divorced. I told myself I\u2019ll never be in another wedding again. Some people don\u2019t understand the investment that it takes to be a good member of a bridal party.\n\nNTA.", "That remains up to her, not you nor I, I trust she'll make the choice she is comfortable with. \nShe can be like the brother or be better...\n\nAgain, that people like it or not, it is up to her, I won't lose sleep if she doesn't go by my advice and follows yours or others. She asked and I gave my opinion which no one has to like nor agree on. Cheers", "It\u2019s a title you make up to appease children when they\u2019re not given their own special role\n\nNTA, OP. You\u2019re being disrespected on every front", "Not a 26 year old lol", "It's like assistant to the district manager, but worse", "Right?? My wedding dress was $800. I got a fabric swatch in the dark red I wanted my bridesmaids to wear and told them to find a dress they liked that complimented the color. Most spent $50-$100. I couldn't imagine asking them to spend more than that."]}
