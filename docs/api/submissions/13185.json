This will at least cut down on his weird need to control your supplies. He won't be able to count how many times a day you empty a menstrual cup.

It's not taboo here and I want my son to know this is perfectly natural regardless of his orientation when he grows up, periods are not dirty or to be ashamed of. I'm so pissed he makes you do things when you have you period, just because why??? What's a period got to do with those jobs? Maybe emptying the bin by the toilet I would get, but he seems to be punishing you for a body function you have no control over, and its also super upsetting that he is also tracking your period, this screams of abuse. I hate the term feminine hygiene because it insinuates that it's dirty. Prefer period products because that's what they are. I hear you though, my mother did not prepare me for mine, and humiliated me when I did as well as scolded me when I asked for period products that I needed. I was adamant I would never do that to any future children I had, she would like to off as if I was in trouble, just for having a period.
