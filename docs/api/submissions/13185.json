I once asked him for Tylenol (my previous mental health issue have led to all of my medications being locked up) and was yelled at by my mother for even mentioning my period to him. Besides, she keeps herself busy berating me for everything else under the sun.\n\nThree: my health?\nI have been trying to get into see a gyno since around Christmas. Between a three month book out and fighting to even get an appointment due to my age (apparently 18 is too young to need to see a gyno) I have just been able to schedule an appointment for early May. At this point one more month doesn\u2019t sound that bad. I have been diagnosed with mild anemia and take iron for it but not even every day so do with that what you will. After reading some people\u2019s comments who have been in similar situations I will be getting my heart tested (it is now suspected I have POTS by a friend who has it) as well as blood work done in two weeks. \n\nFour: going no contact?\nI am trying to, but as an 18 year old with no credit, a low paying job, and not much else to her name it\u2019s a little difficult.

This will at least cut down on his weird need to control your supplies. He won't be able to count how many times a day you empty a menstrual cup. Also they're safer than tampons and you can leave them in longer. It was a game changer for me and honestly much cheaper in the long run.", "NTA. He is punishing you for being a woman.
