They're tiny children. It's not fair to hold that against them. Their \"job\" right now is going to school, eating their vegetables, and doing a few age-appropriate chores. As long as they're holding up their end of the deal, it's a dick move to treat them like freeloaders.", "Buy your own candy.", "Do you expect kids to pay the bills, it\u2019s your job to provide for them. Being a parent is literally a thankless job.", "That\u2019s like your boss not giving you your Christmas bonus and keeping it for himself because \u201che deserves it because he employed you and pays you your salary\u201d. He chose to have a business, he chose to hire you and his responsibility is to pay you (you chose to have a family, your responsibility as a parent is to clothe, feed and pay for your children, it\u2019s not on them to pay up with their things to give back to you, that\u2019s you doing the bare minimum.) neither you nor your boss in this situation have a right to steal and disrespect their child/employee.", "You are the adult and therefore responsible for the bills. They are children who didn\u2019t ask to be here, they are you\u2019re responsibility and that includes paying the bills. Holding the fact that you pays the bills over your children\u2019s heads as a reason to eat their candy is an AH move. Please don\u2019t continue to do that to them, this is coming from a person who\u2019s parents did that exact same thing. I don\u2019t speak to either of them. YTA for eating their candy, just go get them some more, apologize and maybe reevaluate your behaviors and thought process on parenting some.", "I added my haul to a large Rubbermaid bin each year for 12 years. Lmao no leftovers is right!", "forget the candy, OP steals the toys santa leaves if they are not opened by 7am.", "Dad certainly does it.", "This, in my house we also shared candy when I used to go trick or treating, but my parents never took the bowl at night and ate the whole thing.", "Obviously the problem is that you ate all of the candy. I feel like you really don\u2019t understand what happened. You ate THEIR candy, every parent sneaks a couple pieces but it\u2019s understood that it belongs to the child. You ate ALL of it and thought they wouldn\u2019t be upset? Halloween wasn\u2019t even a week ago.", "Personally, I just don't eat *any* of my kids' candy, I just put it up high and let them have a little at a time. I usually buy some candy to hand out and there's usually some left over, so if I have candy, that's what I eat.", "That's absolutely a thing! But you *ask* and you barter, and you only take a few pieces. Kids don't get ownership over much, but trick or treats are sacrosanct! My kids are the same age as yours and will still have Halloween stash left til nearly Christmas - it is OFF LIMITS to me and my husband!", "Yes! My dad would eat some of my sister\u2019s candy but not all of it. My sister ate some of my niece\u2019s but not all of it. Surprisingly, they asked. The kids were more than happy to share. \n\nYou ate all the damn candy. Who eats all of their kids\u2019 Halloween candy? Honestly.", "If you had asked, you would have been fine.  But you just stole.", "If you ask first. Your kids are human, you know you can actually talk to them about things, right?", "you literally admitted you got carried away and ate it all, but are sticking to not being an asshole. no one said you aren\u2019t entitled to any, but you ruined something that brought your kids joy and are defending yourself to the point of insulting your children. get some help", "You should have asked and you should have just had a couple.\n\nMost kids are more than happy to give a couple pieces to their parents. My son even specifically picks out a few butterfingers every year even though he doesn't like them because he knows they're my favorite.\n\nBut he also knows that I wouldn't take his candy without asking and definitely wouldn't eat all of it.", "DId you hid your head really hard recently? why would you \"taX\" f... 6 year olds? you provide for them! they do not own you shit", "It's ok if you ASK them for a few pieces because the candy is THEIRS.\n\nPresuming you put out candy for kids coming to trick or treat at your house, you should have saved some of that for yourself.", "The problem isn\u2019t you stole the candy, you stole their candy and Double Down and blame them for your actions. Apologize and replace what you stole.", "Parent tax is probably at a maximum 4 pieces of candy, NOT ALL of the leftover candy.", "No. You should\u2019ve waited until your children were home and asked them each candy and take what they give or don\u2019t give. Otherwise go buy your own.", "That\u2019s so shit of your parents and teaches kids absolutely nothing. I\u2019m sorry", "no. basically you are saying the kids owe the parents? and its not hard to ask permission, because basically op is invalidating his kid's feelings and being prideful and not apologizing.", "My parents doled out the candy in small amounts over the next year. I\u2019m sure they ate quite a bit. You know what they didn\u2019t do? Eat all of it.\n\nOP, YTA.", "I don\u2019t care if an adult comes up and puts out their bag and says trick or treat and will gladly drop some in.  But this guy didn\u2019t do that, he took from his kids.  If he wants the free candy then he has to play by the rules. Otherwise it\u2019s just stealing from your kids.", "We had a trunk or treat this year at school. Some of the kids said \"Oh! My mom/dad loves those!\" I gave them handfuls for the parents. If parents had bags I'd put candy in their bags. I'm totally on board with sharing and paying a parent tax. If the children know that this is the family's tradition or advance notice that this is starting.\n\nI am extremely picky about my candy. As are my (now adult) children. If we don't like something, it goes right in the share bowl. To my ex, candy was candy so he would eat most of it. Everybody knows; everybody's happy.", "Yeah. Once he got \u201ccarried away\u201d and ate the rest of their candy, it went from being a candy tax to being a total AH move.", "People are \"hostile to it\" because it is stealing. Who cares if you pay the bills? They got that candy for themselves and then you stole it. If you \"deserve a treat\" (whatever the hell that means) you can go to the damn store.", "YTA -\nSorry you got named called (and rightly so) but you literally stole candy from children and show little to no remorse. \n\nIt\u2019s moments like this where I wish there was a bigger AH award we could give you", "They showed more restraint about their own candy than you did about someone else\u2019s.", "Because it wasn't yours. YOU STOLE IT!", "I ask my kid if I can have some candy, and she chooses which pieces I can have. I don't sneak or steal any. It's not mine. Even if I bought it for her, once I give it away it's *no longer mine*. You don't own everything in the house because you pay a mortgage.", "Same. I want my kids to respect my boundaries when I have food I bought for myself as a treat, so I respect their boundaries when they have treats of their own.", "Same. We allocate the candy daily. Like pick 5 pieces and thats it. I will occasionally grab a piece or two but I ask my daughter and she doesnt give a crap. Im sure if i ate the whole bag, shed be rightfully angry. And honestly, Id be embarrassed. How is op not feeling ashamed?", "That's what normal, non AH people do, yes.", "I can't tell you how much extra candy my kids have gotten over the past 2-3 years by saying that x is one of mom's favorites. It's actually kind of embarrassing \ud83e\udd23. \n\nMy 5 and 2 yo ended up with 16.6lbs of candy between them. I'm guessing we will barely make it through all of that by next Halloween. Our neighborhood had so few trick or treaters this year that people were giving my kids multiple handfuls plus extra for mom and dad.", "I didn't mean to take as much as I did. I'll apologize to them but they've been disrespectful about this so I'm not sure yet if I'll buy them more candy.", "they\u2019re 10 and 8 and you stole their candy. Are you expecting them to act like adults? you literally stole candy from a kid. It\u2019s an actual trope at this point.", "What is a respectful way for them to communicate the disappointment at your betrayal of their trust?", ">I'll apologize to them \n\nAs in you haven't yet?\n\nI hope you understand that the esteem in which your children hold you might have been already damaged in a way that could last a life time.", "Hmm - way back when I was little I learned than a real apology means doing what you can to make things right.  Like replacing the candy\u2026.", "You were disrespectful to them first. Why do you expect them to be better than you, a grown ass adult, are?", "Eating all of their candy is disrespectful."]}
