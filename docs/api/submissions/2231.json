Having feelings doesn\u2019t mean other people have to change their lives and plans to avoid those feelings.\n\nAnd some of this is probably also part of the normal experience a lot of adult children experience when their parent\u2019s home is no longer their home.

It doesn't mean you have to stay in the same house for the rest of your life JUST IN CASE she decides to use your home as her safe space. She'll have room at your new house, she needs to get over herself. Having mental health issues doesn't mean she gets to dictate the rest of your life.
