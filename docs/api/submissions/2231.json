The job and housing markets are impossible right now, especially for new grads. She\u2019s probably having a lot of anxiety. You should still sell the house if that\u2019s what you want to do since it\u2019s yours and she\u2019s an adult, but you should also maybe have a discussion with her to try to get to the root of why she\u2019s insecure enough to act so entitled.\n\nETA: what I mean by talk to her is like.

However it may help her though if she feels like you do hear her by sitting down and talking it through with her, and it may help her if she\u2019s got some sort of plan in place to focus on.
