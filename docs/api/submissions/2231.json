On a 500k mortgage loan that\u2019s an extra 300k interest over the life of the loan. Meaning payment costs and all the fun that comes with it. Interest rates currently are the highest they have been in North America since November 2008. Selling your home now to buy a new one for most people is just an exercise in creating more debt.", "Except there's no indication that OP owes money on the home. I mean she's obviously doing well if she can afford to foot the bill for an entire wedding without indicating any stress from it, can't we assume she knows what she's doing regarding her own finances and the market in her area? You literally know no details of her situation yet you're arguing she doesn't know what she's doing.", "Also meant to say she hasn't indicated she is going to be buying a new house right away either. For all we know she's moving into a condo she bought as a vacation home five years ago. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. Time to take care of your future. \n\nDidn\u2019t know there was a degree in psycho.", "NTA. She wants you to pay for her wedding and provide a backup place to live? She doesn't sound very insightful for someone studying psychology.", "NTA. She'll get used to it.  I went through somewhat similar circumstances prior to and after college.  Wasn't happy about my mother selling the house I grew up in, but she needed to and it was a good thing over time.", "DD says her childhood trauma (actually both kids) is triggered by the house but it's her SAFE SPACE? Am I missing something? NTA", "NTA You can't hold onto a house just because she may want to come home to it one day. The fact that you state she will be welcome to the new home is important. Her emotional attachment to an inanimate object she needs therapy for.", "NTA. Put the house on the market immediately. Your daughter will soon have a degree and a husband. They can create their own safe place. In the future, I wouldn\u2019t discuss ANY of the financial aspects of your life with your children. It\u2019s really not their business.", "Sounds like daughter has learned enough psycho babble to manipulate those around her, but not enough to have useful coping skills. NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s your house to sell. Your kids have no say about this.", "NTA.", "NTA. my dad passed two years ago, and my mom is considering selling the house i was raised in and downsizing. I'm 28 and even now i have to admit, the thought of her downsizing hurts since i spent so much of my life in that house and i love it (absolutely cannot afford to buy it off her). BUT. that's for ME to deal with. she lives alone and a four bedroom house is too big for her. as much as it will hurt to say goodbye to that house, that is for me to deal with, with my therapist, i don't get to dump that on her and demand she keep the house.", "NTA Older DD is an adult who is about to be married. She is too old for this kind of preciousness.", "And in my logic, why on earth should I keep, maintain, pay taxes on, a family-sized house, in a place where I don't need (or want) to be any more, for one/two people to rattle around in only using less than 1/3 of the rooms?\n\nOnce the children have all left home, and have independent lives, am I expected to stay in the family home for the rest of my life \"just in case\" one of the kids wants to move back in? \n\nNope. Once the kids were all settled in their own places, and barely ever visited, we upped and sold the big house, moved a few hours away, and found a place just right for two.", "But Mom should still be able to sell the house. Daughter should get counseling or possibly medication if she can\u2019t function.", "My parents have moved 13 times during their marriage because of my dad's job but my mom's cooking has always tasted the same-ish (sometimes she had to make do with replacement ingredients such as fresh herbs (a pain to find in Eastern Europe in winter lol)) and I'd find a bed with the type of blanket that I prefer (I don't really enjoy the wolly, fuzzy blankets). I'm in my 40's and it's still the same.", "In my very limited, since it\u2019s only one person, experience psych majors have a hard time applying the stuff they learned in their own lives. They are too close to the situation and have difficulty being objective.", "I think it\u2019s supposed to be \u2026 not ironic, exactly, but let\u2019s say slightly \u201carch\u201d\u2014since often when one is posting in a forum where such abbreviations are used, the \u201cdarling\u201d family member being thus abbreviated is being a PITA. But maybe that\u2019s an overly generous take!", "I\u2019m not even arguing with the OP or assuming. I\u2019m using the information she provided, which by any reasonable metric indicates the housing market is on the downturn. You seem to be the only person getting upset. If you read my initial comment or attempted to at least respond to any of the easily verifiable evidence for my position, that would be different. My initial comment only asked her to consider her options and re-examine why she is selling based on the contradictions in her statements about the housing market in her area. Regardless of whether or not OP owes money on the home, selling right now in the market she described if you can afford not to is essentially leaving money on the table/losing value. You don\u2019t want to be a seller in a buyer\u2019s market. Speaking as someone with multiple properties.", "I'm not upset at all, this isn't my situation but all this is irrelevant, it has nothing to do with the question. She asked if she was TA for selling the home against her daughters wishes. That's it, the whole question.", "So stop responding. My answer included the NTA label. I also gave unsolicited advice again based off things she said in her post. Fairly common on this subreddit. Go bark up another tree. You made a baseless statement on my comment, I provided context. You continue to be argumentative. Congratulations on your internet trophy.", "I'll stop responding. And maybe you stop messaging me too. Thanks. F'ing creepy."]}
