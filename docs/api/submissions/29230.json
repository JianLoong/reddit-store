When he eventually told me the truth he apologized and he seems to really feel bad. We have been married for almost 2 years, and at the beginning of our relationship we both agreed that strip clubs are a no go and would be cheating.

He had never acted like this before and I think he usually told me the truth but I\u2019m not sure what to believe anymore. I kinda feel betrayed, I always try to make sure he feels loved and is satisfied with our relationship. He never said anything about not being satisfied or discontented with anything.

Yes, off the bat you have a right to be upset, but double yes since he literally lied to you. \n\n\nAlso sorry to tell you this but no one is dropping $500 at a strip club just to throw money onstage.

Can I point out a possible silver lining? \n\nYou *found out* because this is on your joint account. Just imagine how much money could be spent over the years behind your back on a credit card or cash taken out from an ATM that you would be clueless about? \u2014I had a friend who went through a divorce after 15 years of marriage and found out that her STBX had drained their kids college fund at the strip clubs over a seven year period. \n\nHave a serious conversation. $500 is not a marginal amount.

You need to leave him and get checked for stds", "NTA  \n\n\nThis is a huge thing for me personally.

A violation of those is a level of infidelity.   \n\n\nHe knew you were not okay with this, he did it anyways, then he lied about it, blamed you, insulted you and is now 'really sad'. No shit.

Definitely NTA, and truth be told I was hoping this was a troll.", "NTA - Whether he physically cheated or not, it is still betrayal and selfish.

And there it doesn't matter if it was sleeping with another person, going to a strip club or eating two whole cakes - you two agreed on that - so it is a form of cheating. As well as 500 $ is a lot of money to spend on one night there.\n\nIf he doesn't have a good reason for going there (a bachelor party for his best friend and he didn't know where they would spend the evening before. A friend whos girlfriend broke up needed someone to go there to get other thaughts. Or something like that), I would consider taking a break from the relationship.\n\nBut try to have an open talk with him about this situation. If you think it helps, with a conselor. If he tries to blame you, accuse you of cheating again, doesn't see your point or lies about it, consider breaking up and getting a divorce", "500 is more than just a hand job", "NTA.

If he enjoys it, great. But if he were just going by himself at night instead of coming home to his family, I would consider the a crossed boundary. Not cheating exactly, but it would lead to some serious talks.\n\nThe fact that you consider it cheating and you both agreed on this at the start of your marriage creates some huge red flags in your husband. Not to mention the disrespect. \n\nMore than that though, is how he lied about the $500 and accused you of cheating on him! What?! He literally tried to gaslight you and then blame you for being unfaithful to cover his own cheating and lying. That is more than a red flag. \n\nAlso, if he spent $500 on a single night, I fear it was more than just tips to the girls on stage and a lapdance or two. I would be asking if his accusations of you cheating are actually a guilty conscience on his part. I would be wondering what else he did with that $500. \n\nIt's going to be super hard for you to bounce back from this and maybe you shouldn't. He was clearly unfaithful to you, lied to you and accused you of cheating to cover his own tracks. I don't think I could ever be with a man that pulled all of that in one night.  \n\nYou're NTA at all and probably need to ask more questions to see how far his unfaithfulness actually went. \n\nGood luck, OP.", "NTA.

Then he lied and got defensive. Then he accused YOU of cheating. (I\u2019m not even sure how that came into his head unless there\u2019s information missing from the story.)\n\nI spent many years as a bouncer in a strip club. Many. Here\u2019s what I know:\n\nThe only people who throw that kind of money around at a strip club are rich guys who are trying to fuck a stripper, and poor guys who are trying to fuck a stripper. No one is dropping $500 on a lappy unless there\u2019s a promise of some happy. \n\nDo with that information what you will.", "NTA\n\nI've had my fair share of nights at strip clubs, and unless this wasn't a small town dingy strip club, $500 can go pretty quickly.  But at the same time, this isn't the 'toss a few dollars on stage shile sippping on a beer amount'\n\nIt's likely he got a VIP room and was one on one with a stripper for 20 or 30 minutes.  Not trying to paint a picture you don't want to think about, but for $500 he likely didn't have his dick out, but the stripper definitely was topless or fully nude while sitting on top of him.  At his age and lack of strip club experience, he probably was an easy mark for lap dances but I doubt he'd be able to coerce \"special service\" for that price. \n\nChances are, he feels significantly more regret about the money and hurting you, rather than feeling like his strip club experience was worth it.  And don't feel insecure, majority of strippers are primarily plastic.  A small percentage are actually beautiful women. \n\nI'd play close attention to his actions though.  He better treat you exceptionally well over the next few weeks.  Other wise he doesn't care about you as much as he should.  Also, make it known there will be clear consequences if he ever does this again.", "YTA for being upset over a strip club.\n\nNTA for being upset that he would be stupid enough to spend $500. Did he get a hand job? Were they snorting cocaine?", "Going to a strip clubs isn't cheating. Ffs.However, he's an ass for lying & spending the dosh. It doesn't mean he doesn't love you. Move on", "ESH.  He\u2019s by far worse with the lying and the defensive accusations.  But some blame goes to your family for lying to you about strip clubs being the equivalent of cheating, and you for not seeing through that at your age.\n\nAnd for those not initiated in the ways of the gentlemen\u2019s club, it is EASY to spend $500 without any prostitution occurring (hint, the alcohol is marked way up), especially if a group go together.  Reminder, I\u2019m not justifying the husband spending a large chunk of money without discussing with the OP, and I\u2019m not saying it was okay to lie about it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
