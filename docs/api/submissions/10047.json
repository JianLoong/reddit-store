Awhile back he reached out to me to help figure out ring size and the set up so he could make this the most magical day for her. Having known my friend for over 20+ years, I know exactly how she wants her proposal to go and who she wants to be there, so I relayed all this information to him months ago via texts and over the phone. I even took the time to covertly find and confirm which ring she would love the most.\n\nA little background: My friend is INCREDIBLY family and friend oriented, and in the past expressed to me on multiple occasions (especially during holiday season) that in the 5 years they\u2019ve been together, he hasn\u2019t really made much of an effort to indoctrinate himself into her family or friendships the way she has for his.  While I do generally like him, i have always felt that he is incredibly self-serving and self-focused.\n\nRecently, through a mutual friend, I found out he started a group text between his (emphasis on HIS) friends and his family to set up the time and date of the proposal. He has not only excluded myself (and according to the screenshots I\u2019ve seen, he is doing everything VERBATIM I suggested he do) but he has completely excluded her family and other close friends from the event. He is planning on only having his \u201cboys\u201d and family present for the occasion, and knowing my friend this would ultimately break her heart not being able to share this moment with her loved ones.\n\nI got a heated and called him. At first he was dodging my questions, then just out right said \u201cthis is my proposal and I\u2019ve spent enough time and money to choose how I do it, just be happy for your friend. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re not coming to the wedding.\u201d This INFURIATED me, and to make matters worse, I ran into her mom and dad at the grocery store and subtly asked if they knew of any possibility she was getting engaged. They were unaware, and I know for a fact my friend has told him that he needs to ask her parents for their blessing (she\u2019s somewhat traditional).\n\nMy friend wears her heart on her sleeve, and I can predict how this event will go down when she sees all of his close friends and family and none of hers. Considering her previous sentiments about his lack of interest in her family/life, she will 100% see this as being hurtful and selfish and I know she\u2019ll cry. To make matters worse, the location of the proposal is a whopping 30 minutes from her parents home. \n\nI don\u2019t want to get involved in a fight or reveal the surprise, but on the other hand I feel I owe it to my life long friend to help her avoid being hurt and disappointed, maybe even helping her rethink what her future would look like with someone who just doesn\u2019t really appreciate what she values in life. So, AITA if I tell my friend her boyfriend is going to propose?\n\nEDIT: I did not tell her parents, I ~covertly~ inquired if he had spoken to them yet about proposing since it\u2019s been 5 years, like in a joking way.\n\nEdit 2: the proposal is scheduled for this weekend, I will give you guys an update on how it goes. After so many responses, I have decided not to say anything and to let things play out. I gave him an opportunity by expressing the need to invite her parents and friends like she\u2019s always wanted, and he chose not to - that\u2019s on him, not me!", "created_utc": 1676488873, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11364rz/aita_if_i_tell_my_friend_her_bf_is_planning_to/", "score": 132, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let him propose his way and when your friend comes to you and complains you can kindly and gently tell her that you tried to get him to incorporate her friends/family. Then you can gently ask her if she wants to spend the rest of her life with a man who doesn\u2019t honor her wants/desires. I repeat JUST LET THIS PLAY ITSELF OUT. YWBTA if you interfere prior to the proposal", "DO NOT TELL HER. As much as you know her and want this proposal to go as planned, it is ultimately up to her boyfriend how he wants to do it. If your friend is disappointed, then that can be her sign to discuss with her fianc\u00e9 about moving forward.

I hope your best friend sees her intended and all his family flying the red flags.\n\nSadly, YWBTA.", "YWBTA\n\nBest to just let it play out and if your friend confides in you any concerns you should encourage her to have open communication with ***him*** regarding each one so she has a solid understanding of who he really is and isn't caught up in the moment or planning a wedding.  \n\nHe's putting an awful lot of pressure for her to say yes when she's already seeing the writing on the wall. Adding more people in the room may not be what she'd actually want if she really needs more time to think about marriage to him.", "YWBTA - This is unfortunately one of those situations that will probably play better if you let it play out. You can be there in the aftermath, support her if she is devastated. In short, I've learned from an experience in my youth that you can't break people up, even if there are red flags. (And there were red flags, but it tore apart our friendship for years even after she broke up with him) You will be accused of meddling and trying to break them up, maybe not by your friend, but it will muddy the waters. As much as it hurts we have to give people the space to get there on their own there own. If the engagement is a bust then you tell her so she has the added info that he was told the right way and still messed up. But before? She probably will lash out at you.", "YWBTA. Don't tell her. If you do, he'll hate you, and she may feel you ruined her surprise. \nJust tell him that you believe she would want her family and friends to be there too. And if he decides not to do it, then that'll be his problem", "YTA, softly. I agree you have a good intentions. But she needs to see him for who he really is. It may be that she already sees these flaws in him because she has mentioned it to you. You\u2019re right what he\u2019s doing is very selfish, and all about him and not her. Unfortunately, she may need to go through that kind of pain to understand. He\u2019s not the person for her.", "Gentle YWBTA. You want to protect your friend which is noble but if you try to you could be seen as the saboteur and will definitely be blamed by the BF. This is a very tricky situation.\n\nHonestly, letting this play out might be the best way for her to see who he really is, that he doesn't really care about her wishes, traditions, family, etc. That alone could convince her that he isn't \"the one.\"", "I am sure she will notice everything when he asks her and hopefully she says no\n\nNot including her family is a wild decision. If you say something, she will probably contact him and it will be this huge issue and he will most likely lie and say he was going to do something but you ruined it. She's going to be hurt and disappointed no matter what- that's unavoidable unless he changes his mind about inviting everyone. Honestly I'd stay out of it and let it play out.", "Ughh. I\u2019m so sorry about this. I don\u2019t think you should tell her. YWBTA \n\nHowever, this is a CYA situation. \n\nWrite him a heartfelt letter about the proposal. You would be sending the email to him but really you\u2019re writing to your friend\u2014because this is the letter you want to show her AFTER the proposal so she knows exactly what kind of person she\u2019s with. Mention that you\u2019re so happy he reached out to you to get her the ring she loves. It\u2019s very important that you sound VERY supportive of their relationship\u2014do not let even an ounce of frustration show. Emphasize how much her family means to her and how she\u2019ll be absolutely heartbroken if they\u2019re excluded. Tell him there\u2019s time to fix it. Write it for your friend\u2019s eyes. \n\nThen when your friend comes crying to you and wonders if she should forgive him for *\u201dnot knowing\u201d* how important these things were to her, you can give her definitive proof that he did know and he didn\u2019t care.", "YTA\n\nStay out.

Just like with parents who see their children making mistakes, unless it's life threatening (and even then, intervention doesn't always help) there's nothing you can do.\n\nIf everything goes down as said, perhaps in that moment, things will become clear to her or they'll become clearer later on before the wedding.\n\nYou trying to prevent her hurt will do little to no good - it'll likely cause a rift and potentially have you relegated to no longer being a life long friend.\n\nWhile your intentions are honorable, YWBTA if you ruin the proposal.\n\n*\\*edited for grammar*", "YTA - As much as you want it to be, this is simply not your business. His proposal and her reaction to it is between them as a couple.  You're free to carry around an \"I told you so\" for him when it all goes south, but it's not your place to get involved in this and it may even backfire on you with your friend if decide to.", "YTA. \n\n  \nLet the people in the relationship deal with it. You've done what you can - you told him it'll upset her. If she wants to rethink her life, she can do that when he proposes. You can't protect her from hurt - even if you tell her now, sure it might save her crying in front of his friends/family, but she'll still be incredibly hurt by her partner. \n\n  \nI think intervening in their relationship further sounds like it could backfire on your friendship. You're not the one hurting her, let her make her own choices about the kind of man she wants to say yes or no to. The best you can do is try one more time to get him to invite her side to the proposal and to be ready with a lot of emotional support if she does end up upset that day. I think your heart is in the right place but your lack of boundaries in this friendship is causing you to become overly involved in her romantic relationship.", "YWBTA. I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but you cannot coddle her for the rest of her life. Let things play out. You are not her mom or her caretaker. They might be about to get married - they will encounter countless things that she might shed tears on. Are you going to jump in and prevent every single one of them? Let adults face the consequences of their own actions", "You can't avoid her being hurt. He will hurt her eventually. Better she realizes with his selfish proposal who she would be marrying.\n\nYWBTA if you intervene and help him hide his lack of care for your friend.", "YTA\n\nIf I\u2019m reading correctly, you have told him twice that she wants her family and friends st her proposal. That\u2019s as much as you can do.\n\nLook at it this way\u2014your friend needs to have the proposal go wrong. Then she needs you to tell her, if she asks you, that he knew, through you, that she wanted her family and friends there. \n\nShe needs to have that information\u2014that he blatantly disregarded her desires\u2014in order to make an informed decision about whether she wants to spend the rest of her life with him or not.\n\nAt this point, you need to stop back and let things play out. \n\n\u201cFixing\u201d her proposal could be the worst thing you could do to her, in some ways. She wouldn\u2019t learn until later that he doesn\u2019t care about what she wants, that he thinks money gives him the right to plan things for the two of them.\n\nI know you want to spare her pain, but maybe feeling that hurt will help her make the right choice about who to marry, in a way that wouldn\u2019t happen if you managed to patch this proposal up.\n\nMy reasoning is that I would hate a public proposal. All I would want would be me and the guy. Anyone staging a public proposal would get rejected, because by having a public proposal they would have shown that they know nothing about me and don\u2019t care about my happiness or comfort.\n\nYou owe your friend the same ability to make her own choice.", "Hmmm YWBTA. You shouldn't interfere with this moment. They're a couple, you have no right to stick your nose in someone else's relationship, and no right to interfere with the proposal.

If I were the friend I\u2019d absolutely want to know and be able to prepare myself and think it through. I\u2019d be very upset and flabbergasted to walk into a proposal unprepared like that. The fact that you\u2019ve warned this guy of your friends wishes and he\u2019s ignoring that advice is very telling of his character. My mom did warn me when my bf asked her for my hand in marriage and I was thankful for the heads up.", "[deleted]", "YTA. He\u2019s right. Just be happy for them.

It sounds like the proposal won't go well for him OR for her. No one is going to win in this scenario and everyone will be hurt.

Threaten to tell her or her family if he doesnt change the plans and tell him its in his best interest.", "Let him show his true colors to him, I truly hope she looks him in the face when he proposes and goes \u201cwhy are my family and friends not here?\u201d Just to see what\u2019s he\u2019s going to say.

I genuinely hope your friend sees it, and him, for what it is and says no. Because we don't know her as a person, if you think she will feel forced to say yes under those conditions (as many women feel they need to say yes and suck it up because its \"just a proposal\") then it's a soft maybe? Each person is different, you know your friend, you have maybe talked to her about this kind of stuff several times, this sub can't make the decision (or asshole verdict) for you because none of these people know you or your friend or what she would want. I definitely get where you are coming from, but ultimately, sometimes you just have to watch the tire fire burn and put faith in your friend that she is able to make the right decision for herself.", "The fact that her parents didn't share if boyfriend had reached out to them about proposing doesn't mean ANYTHING - they may have heard from him but are keeping this news to themselves instead of blabbing to YOU.\n\nYWBTA if you intervene here.

Yes you know her well and want what's best but clearly if it's been 5 years he knows her pretty well too and what happens is between them.

Shes had 5 years to propose to him anyway she wants, let him shoot his shot and she can react how she wants.", "Don\u2019t do anything. He already told you that he intends to cut you out of her life.

She may still say \"yes\" even if it wasn't THE PERFECT proposal, so be sure you two go for manicures the day before. Good luck!", "YWBTA but you can give him one more warning about asking her Dad first and also ask his thoughts on you throwing an engagement party after the proposal that includes her family and friends. If he's against that then he has bigger issues with her family than she realizes and you can tell her after the proposal his previous stances.", "Let it play out   She will see what type of person he is    Fill her in later about your experience with this scenario", "INFO I understand your concerns but what has your friend said about this in the past? They've been dating for 5 years and if he excludes her family/friends and ignores her wishes she should be able to make the right choice.

Be there to support her either way.", "Yikes, you're in a bad spot.

You helped as much as you could, but it\u2019s time to step back and leave their relationship to them.

Solid decision on not telling.", "Glad you decided not to spoil his surprise. Just want to reinforce that's the right thing to do in this case.", "YTA.  This has nothing to do with you; this is between him and her.", "YTA/YWBTA. you talk a lot about you just \"predict\" how her reaction to the proposal will go, but you seems to lack any direct evidence to show she specifically wants her friends and family to be there for the proposal. you also assume that the lack of her parents telling you about BF having plans to propose means he didn't get their blessing, and not that they wouldn't tell you, because your their daughters best friend and they don't want to tell you incase you let it slip to her. it honestly just sounds like you're codependent on her, and your third wheeling you way into their relationship under the guise your her friend and know what's best for her.", "YTA. You said you told him how your friend would want her proposal why didn't you also include that she would want her family and friends there. Since he did it VERBATIM, he would have done that too.", "[removed]", "I sincerely hope it is the wake up call that OP\u2019s friend needs. If she stays in the relationship, he is always going to center himself and his family and friends.", "That just feels cruel\u2026 I don\u2019t know, letting her walk into a situation where she\u2019ll have all these eyes on her - a situation she can\u2019t do over again. Maybe I\u2019ll try speaking with him again to convince him of what he needs to do, but my god\u2026 my heart just breaks for her\u2026", "> Oh, hell, let the guy royally fuck up his proposal. It\u2019s not like you haven\u2019t warned him.\n\nSo much this!!!", "I agree! Let her see for herself how utterly self-centered this guy is.

I still can......?\"", "I didn\u2019t tell her parents to clarify - it was a jovial conversation.

Don't make yourself the enemy to him now. Let it play out, let your friend come to you and then you can explain after.", "This is the answer.\n\nThe hurt she\u2019ll experience from the proposal won\u2019t compare to the lifetime of hurt she\u2019ll experience if she marries this self-centered, inconsiderate, selfish jerk.\n\nLet her go through this hurt and hopefully her eyes will open and she\u2019ll dump his behind.", "Sadly don\u2019t forget option 3 she is upset and hurt but he makes her feel guilty for her being \u201cinconsiderate\u201d for all the work he put into it.", "NTA Make sure she knows after that you tried to tell him...", "Why does everyone think I\u2019m being co-dependent?! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d She\u2019s basically my sister, I have loyalty to her like no one else. Let me just say that I acknowledge the breath of your opinion and definitely agree that it\u2019s none of my business which is why I\u2019m struggling in this situation. But just a reminder that I haven\u2019t done anything yet, which is why I\u2019m looking for insight. I just wish people would stop being kind of mean to me I\u2019m the comments hahaha", "That is what I was going to suggest as well.

It\u2019s his proposal - he gets to do this how he wants to. OP needs to back off him.", "This!", "Or maybe she is guilt tripped (is it written that way?) into saying Yes. Being asked for a proposal in front of many people can pressure you really hard into doing things", "Might not be your cup of tea, but everyone is different! I respect your opinion, I hope you can respect hers.", "I think the issue here is that OP\u2019s friend WANTS her friends/family invited, and the bf is specifically only inviting HIS friends and family (ergo the presence of friends/fam is not an issue to him either)", "Yup It's friggin weird!", "\\*He\\* sounds controlling? OP sounds controlling.", "How does he sound controlling and devious? By wanting to decide how he proposes?", "Would you be upset if your soon to be fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t invite any of your family to your surprise engagement? I would. He is purposely doing something that will hurt her by not including her family and friends as well. That makes him the bigger asshole in this situation.", "She wont have to....looks like the guy is gonna do that all by himself.", ">I know exactly how she wants her proposal to go **and who she wants to be there, so I relayed all this information to him months ago** via texts and over the phone.\n\nshe did, he just did all of the other details Verbatim while ignoring that piece of info, OP is NTA, the bf(want-to-be fianc\u00e9) is the AH here", "I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t understand\u2026. Did you intend to reply to me?", "But maybe it's a situation she CAN do over again with a guy that respects her wishes. You spoke up for her. You did your part. Step back and be there for her if/when she's disappointed.", "Stop. You cannot manage this outcome. He's made it clear he's not open to more input. I know you want to make it perfect for her, but HE is the one who she (might) marry, and if there's a problem, THEY need to sort it out. You will not be there to referee their marriage. Step back.", "I understand where you are coming from, but it\u2019s really  none of your business and YWBTA for telling her. Just let it play out and if she says no, then that\u2019s that.", "I understand- but what if you tell her, and then he goes and does what you suggested? It will make it look like you tried to sabotage everything. I would give him your opinion and then butt out.", "No, don\u2019t speak to him again. If he can\u2019t even consider her desire when she\u2019s being proposed, he\u2019s not the guy for her. Yes, it would be a very embarrassing situation for her to get proposed and be disappointed, but ultimately it is not your place to interfere. It might open her eyes that he\u2019s not the guy for her. Let him screw it up on his own", "I get it. I really do. But I still agree with the thought that you need to stay out of it", "Maybe she needs to see him for what he is", "Your trying to dictate what another person does and that won\u2019t work Out well in the long run. It\u2019s also the bf\u2019s proposal and you have to respect the fashion in which he is choosing to propose. If she is disappointed let her express that to him.", "You should leave it alone. If he can\u2019t figure out what she wants at this point, should they really be getting married? Let him make his own choices so she can make hers.", "Hopefully this will be enough to make her walk away from him.  It sounds like he is trying to isolate her from her family and friends and it will only get worse the longer this relationship goes on especially if they get married", "You have warned him about how you think she will take it. If he ignores it,it's all on him. Stay out of it.", "So i'm going to disagree here. and I'll probably be downvoted but that's okay. I'm gonna say ESH. Him for planning a proposal the opposite of what she would like and what he probably (hopefully) has some clue what she would want. also him for doing such a self centred proposal in public. Public proposals put pressure on the woman to say yes in unfair ways. if she's in front of his family and his friends and doesn't see her family and friends.... like she'll probably be hecking confused, sad, and also under huge pressure to just say yes. I think you were probably trying to ask her parents tactfully and it probably wasn't as tactful as you thought it might have been. You're kinda of in a no win situation and every option you have isn't great. I think it ultimate comes down this, and we can't really judge- do you know this person as well as you think you do? And is this hill you're willing to die on cause if you're wrong, and you spoil his surprise, and it a proposal she'd have been happy with, you're no longer going to be friends with her or at the very least, it'll be a huge crack in your relationship.", "I mean you were in the thread chain about the proposal so a mutual friend was involved. Just stop. Not your business. Inquiring to parents about oh it's been 5 years is also just icky. No one in a relationship want that. \n\nJust worry about your own relationships. Not hers.", "To be fair if he had asked them I would think they wouldn\u2019t say anything anyway until after the proposal, just incase. Or at least I would hope they would know to keep it under their hats.", "The fact is you spoke your peace already. Now stay out of it...", "I don't necessarily mean you're disrespecting her boundaries, I'm sorry for that implication. I mean sometimes when we have a *best* friend who we share everything with, we generally don't put UP boundaries. It seems like you two have that kind of friendship. It can be nice, *but* it means it also feels normal to you to intervene and tell her boyfriend what to do when realistically, that's becoming overinvolved. I think you're too close to her to necessarily see how inappropriate that is.\n\nUnfortunately, sometimes we need to let people we love walk into the disaster - she's the one dating someone selfish and maybe she'll finally see it.\n\nGood luck on the last attempt at reaching out!", "YTA - Mind your own business. Do NOT tell her beforehand because you're mad you are not invited to witness the proposal. Doing so will get you uninvited from the wedding.\n\nYou are saying you know what is best, you already know exactly how it's going to happen and everything will be horrible and burst into flames if the proposal is not performed exactly as YOU have it planned out. Check yourself - it's not your proposal, your participation is specifically NOT wanted, most likely due to the fact that you keep telling him what he NEEDS to do.", "Oh yeah, I forgot about the gas lighting option >_<", "A lot of people tend to be kind of mean in the AITA comments. We can see that you truly love your friend, and that you're worried about her being disappointed. But this is one of those instances where you should just step back and let her BF propose in his own way. I agree that her BF seems to be acting like an asshole, but unfortunately he's the asshole that she seems to want in her life. I'd definitely talk to her about it after the proposal. And maybe see if you can set up a friend and family gathering to help her feel special (after the proposal). I'm sorry that this situation is so stressful.", "Hun, saying you're coming off as co-dependent isn't mean; it's an observation. The level to which you are even *considering* sticking your nose in this should have been your first clue.", "So his partners wants and dreams of a proposal don't matter? It doesn't matter that she has always wanted HER friends and HER family to be there to witness it? So it's all about him?", "That's definitely a possibility but that also leaves the door open after the fact when she's questioning it.\n\n\"Look I didn't want to say anything before but since you're hesitant let me show you some things from before he proposed.\"", "Yeah, no argument there. People can propose to their partner however they want, and it's no one else's business", "That\u2019s perfect bc she can see him for who he is and what he prioritizes.  OP should let the situation unfold without intervening", "Average redditor", "Maybe some extra context is needed here: her mother and me are very close considering I didn\u2019t grow up with a mom and grew up next door to them. She has asked me on multiple occasions whenever I see her if I have heard anything about her getting engaged - I\u2019m the one who hasn\u2019t told her about the engagement. BUT!!! Who knows, I can\u2019t possibly know for certain, so I respect where you\u2019re coming from!", "Definitely an accurate observation at that. I think OP is too close to the situation already, getting any closer is a red flag for this friendship imo. Let it play out.", "Her friend already informed BF, what BF does is on him. Threatening is gross.", "She could propose to him, and do it exactly how she wants it to be done. You don't get to control surprises. If the BF knows and cared, he'd make it as close as he could, but he doesn't care. She will hopefully see that, or, at least it'll be one more brick in the wall of reasons to leave when she finally does pull off the blinders. This is all about him being an AH, and OP has no place here. What does she think will happen that her friend STOP her BF from proposing until he re-plans it? That's not going to go well. It's crap either way, because BF is an AH. Best not to get involved, because explosive diarrhea doesn't care about intent.", ">> Average redditor\n\nAverage redditor", "Not caring about what your partner would like is gross and purposely excluding her family and friends is gross", "Proposal hasn\u2019t actually happened yet.", "*Both* are gross."]}
