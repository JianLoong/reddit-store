Awhile back he reached out to me to help figure out ring size and the set up so he could make this the most magical day for her. Having known my friend for over 20+ years, I know exactly how she wants her proposal to go and who she wants to be there, so I relayed all this information to him months ago via texts and over the phone. I even took the time to covertly find and confirm which ring she would love the most.\n\nA little background: My friend is INCREDIBLY family and friend oriented, and in the past expressed to me on multiple occasions (especially during holiday season) that in the 5 years they\u2019ve been together, he hasn\u2019t really made much of an effort to indoctrinate himself into her family or friendships the way she has for his.  While I do generally like him, i have always felt that he is incredibly self-serving and self-focused.\n\nRecently, through a mutual friend, I found out he started a group text between his (emphasis on HIS) friends and his family to set up the time and date of the proposal. He has not only excluded myself (and according to the screenshots I\u2019ve seen, he is doing everything VERBATIM I suggested he do) but he has completely excluded her family and other close friends from the event. He is planning on only having his \u201cboys\u201d and family present for the occasion, and knowing my friend this would ultimately break her heart not being able to share this moment with her loved ones.\n\nI got a heated and called him. At first he was dodging my questions, then just out right said \u201cthis is my proposal and I\u2019ve spent enough time and money to choose how I do it, just be happy for your friend. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re not coming to the wedding.\u201d This INFURIATED me, and to make matters worse, I ran into her mom and dad at the grocery store and subtly asked if they knew of any possibility she was getting engaged. They were unaware, and I know for a fact my friend has told him that he needs to ask her parents for their blessing (she\u2019s somewhat traditional).\n\nMy friend wears her heart on her sleeve, and I can predict how this event will go down when she sees all of his close friends and family and none of hers. Considering her previous sentiments about his lack of interest in her family/life, she will 100% see this as being hurtful and selfish and I know she\u2019ll cry. To make matters worse, the location of the proposal is a whopping 30 minutes from her parents home. \n\nI don\u2019t want to get involved in a fight or reveal the surprise, but on the other hand I feel I owe it to my life long friend to help her avoid being hurt and disappointed, maybe even helping her rethink what her future would look like with someone who just doesn\u2019t really appreciate what she values in life. So, AITA if I tell my friend her boyfriend is going to propose?\n\nEDIT: I did not tell her parents, I ~covertly~ inquired if he had spoken to them yet about proposing since it\u2019s been 5 years, like in a joking way.\n\nEdit 2: the proposal is scheduled for this weekend, I will give you guys an update on how it goes. After so many responses, I have decided not to say anything and to let things play out. I gave him an opportunity by expressing the need to invite her parents and friends like she\u2019s always wanted, and he chose not to - that\u2019s on him, not me!", "created_utc": 1676488873, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11364rz/aita_if_i_tell_my_friend_her_bf_is_planning_to/", "score": 3287, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let him propose his way and when your friend comes to you and complains you can kindly and gently tell her that you tried to get him to incorporate her friends/family. Then you can gently ask her if she wants to spend the rest of her life with a man who doesn\u2019t honor her wants/desires. I repeat JUST LET THIS PLAY ITSELF OUT. YWBTA if you interfere prior to the proposal", "DO NOT TELL HER. As much as you know her and want this proposal to go as planned, it is ultimately up to her boyfriend how he wants to do it. If your friend is disappointed, then that can be her sign to discuss with her fianc\u00e9 about moving forward. It is not your place to tell her or intervene at this point.", "Oh, hell, *let* the guy royally fuck up his proposal.

I hope your best friend sees her intended and all his family flying the red flags.\n\nSadly, YWBTA.", "YWBTA\n\nBest to just let it play out and if your friend confides in you any concerns you should encourage her to have open communication with ***him*** regarding each one so she has a solid understanding of who he really is and isn't caught up in the moment or planning a wedding.  \n\nHe's putting an awful lot of pressure for her to say yes when she's already seeing the writing on the wall. Adding more people in the room may not be what she'd actually want if she really needs more time to think about marriage to him.", "YWBTA - This is unfortunately one of those situations that will probably play better if you let it play out. You can be there in the aftermath, support her if she is devastated. In short, I've learned from an experience in my youth that you can't break people up, even if there are red flags. (And there were red flags, but it tore apart our friendship for years even after she broke up with him) You will be accused of meddling and trying to break them up, maybe not by your friend, but it will muddy the waters. As much as it hurts we have to give people the space to get there on their own there own. If the engagement is a bust then you tell her so she has the added info that he was told the right way and still messed up. But before? She probably will lash out at you.", "YWBTA. Don't tell her. If you do, he'll hate you, and she may feel you ruined her surprise. \nJust tell him that you believe she would want her family and friends to be there too. And if he decides not to do it, then that'll be his problem", "YTA, softly. I agree you have a good intentions. But she needs to see him for who he really is. It may be that she already sees these flaws in him because she has mentioned it to you. You\u2019re right what he\u2019s doing is very selfish, and all about him and not her. Unfortunately, she may need to go through that kind of pain to understand. He\u2019s not the person for her.", "Gentle YWBTA. You want to protect your friend which is noble but if you try to you could be seen as the saboteur and will definitely be blamed by the BF. This is a very tricky situation.\n\nHonestly, letting this play out might be the best way for her to see who he really is, that he doesn't really care about her wishes, traditions, family, etc. That alone could convince her that he isn't \"the one.\"", "I am sure she will notice everything when he asks her and hopefully she says no\n\nNot including her family is a wild decision. If you say something, she will probably contact him and it will be this huge issue and he will most likely lie and say he was going to do something but you ruined it. She's going to be hurt and disappointed no matter what- that's unavoidable unless he changes his mind about inviting everyone. Honestly I'd stay out of it and let it play out.", "Ughh. I\u2019m so sorry about this. I don\u2019t think you should tell her. YWBTA if you ruin the surprise.\n\nHowever, this is a CYA situation. \n\nWrite him a heartfelt letter about the proposal. You would be sending the email to him but really you\u2019re writing to your friend\u2014because this is the letter you want to show her AFTER the proposal so she knows exactly what kind of person she\u2019s with. Mention that you\u2019re so happy he reached out to you to get her the ring she loves. It\u2019s very important that you sound VERY supportive of their relationship\u2014do not let even an ounce of frustration show. Emphasize how much her family means to her and how she\u2019ll be absolutely heartbroken if they\u2019re excluded. Tell him there\u2019s time to fix it. Write it for your friend\u2019s eyes. \n\nThen when your friend comes crying to you and wonders if she should forgive him for *\u201dnot knowing\u201d* how important these things were to her, you can give her definitive proof that he did know and he didn\u2019t care.", "YTA\n\nStay out.

Just like with parents who see their children making mistakes, unless it's life threatening (and even then, intervention doesn't always help) there's nothing you can do.\n\nIf everything goes down as said, perhaps in that moment, things will become clear to her or they'll become clearer later on before the wedding.\n\nYou trying to prevent her hurt will do little to no good - it'll likely cause a rift and potentially have you relegated to no longer being a life long friend.\n\nWhile your intentions are honorable, YWBTA if you ruin the proposal.\n\n*\\*edited for grammar*", "YTA - As much as you want it to be, this is simply not your business. His proposal and her reaction to it is between them as a couple.  You're free to carry around an \"I told you so\" for him when it all goes south, but it's not your place to get involved in this and it may even backfire on you with your friend if decide to.", "YTA. \n\n  \nLet the people in the relationship deal with it. You've done what you can - you told him it'll upset her. If she wants to rethink her life, she can do that when he proposes. You can't protect her from hurt - even if you tell her now, sure it might save her crying in front of his friends/family, but she'll still be incredibly hurt by her partner. \n\n  \nI think intervening in their relationship further sounds like it could backfire on your friendship. You're not the one hurting her, let her make her own choices about the kind of man she wants to say yes or no to. The best you can do is try one more time to get him to invite her side to the proposal and to be ready with a lot of emotional support if she does end up upset that day. I think your heart is in the right place but your lack of boundaries in this friendship is causing you to become overly involved in her romantic relationship.", "YWBTA. I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but you cannot coddle her for the rest of her life. Let things play out. You are not her mom or her caretaker. They might be about to get married - they will encounter countless things that she might shed tears on. Are you going to jump in and prevent every single one of them? Let adults face the consequences of their own actions", "You can't avoid her being hurt. He will hurt her eventually. Better she realizes with his selfish proposal who she would be marrying.\n\nYWBTA if you intervene and help him hide his lack of care for your friend.", "YTA\n\nIf I\u2019m reading correctly, you have told him twice that she wants her family and friends st her proposal. That\u2019s as much as you can do.\n\nLook at it this way\u2014your friend needs to have the proposal go wrong. Then she needs you to tell her, if she asks you, that he knew, through you, that she wanted her family and friends there. \n\nShe needs to have that information\u2014that he blatantly disregarded her desires\u2014in order to make an informed decision about whether she wants to spend the rest of her life with him or not.\n\nAt this point, you need to stop back and let things play out. \n\n\u201cFixing\u201d her proposal could be the worst thing you could do to her, in some ways. She wouldn\u2019t learn until later that he doesn\u2019t care about what she wants, that he thinks money gives him the right to plan things for the two of them.\n\nI know you want to spare her pain, but maybe feeling that hurt will help her make the right choice about who to marry, in a way that wouldn\u2019t happen if you managed to patch this proposal up.\n\nMy reasoning is that I would hate a public proposal. All I would want would be me and the guy. Anyone staging a public proposal would get rejected, because by having a public proposal they would have shown that they know nothing about me and don\u2019t care about my happiness or comfort.\n\nYou owe your friend the same ability to make her own choice.", "Hmmm YWBTA. You shouldn't interfere with this moment. They're a couple, you have no right to stick your nose in someone else's relationship, and no right to interfere with the proposal.

Please just try for a moment to understand that we all have people in our lives we care deeply for and want only the best for them, and when we worry for them it can sometimes obstruct our judgement.

Unfortunately, there is no getting away from the fact that making either decision on whether I do or don\u2019t say anything will inevitably both end in negative outcomes. The only difference is that by not interjecting myself, I avoid an outcome where I\u2019m at fault and possibly become her enemy, which may end up pushing her closer to him and further away from a support system that she may not realize she needs in the future. Not taking action is still an action, but I have to trust that she can handle making that decision herself.", "No!  that sounds like a great way for him share what's going on first and in the process  twist the story so that he's the victim of OP's meddling.
