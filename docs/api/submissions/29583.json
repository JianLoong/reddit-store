Having time to yourself is important.\n\nCaveat being that ample quality time is spent on a regular basis, as in not being holed up away from gf all and every weekend for example and these trips are the only quality time.", "NTA. First of all, it is your leave to \"waste\" if you so choose. It is perfectly normal and healthy to take some time for yourself, especially since you have other stuff planned with her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe sounds a bit controlling and codependent.", "Your gf is not listening to your needs.

Red flags on her behavior", "NTA.  Days of leave don't always need to be used for trips, events, or planned activities. \nYou need time to recharge yourself. This is not selfish.", "NTA. Your annual leave is meant to be used to recharge. Yes, your partner should be a priority in your life. But they shouldn't be the only way you relax. It's unhealthy for her to demand that you should save every single one of your annual leave days to spend with her when you've explicitly said you just want to chill at home.\n\nTake your time off, and enjoy it. Your not being selfish. You know who is though? Your girlfriend.", "NTA. She wants to selfishly use your holidays to be benefit her. You\u2019ve got plenty trips planned. Is she controlling in any other aspects of your relationship?", "Here's the thing. Your girlfriend says:\n\n>she said I should still save it in case something else comes up that we want to do\n\nBut what she means is:\n\n>in case something else comes up that ***I*** want to do\n\nShe wants to use your leave for her enjoyment. You are separate people, you are allowed, entitled even, to take time for yourself to relax, recharge, and unwind. That is a totally normal thing to do. For someone who has enjoyed 25 of your 28 days doing elaborate holidays, trips, and dates, for her to then call you selfish for wanting just 3 to spend at home is, frankly, ***fucking wild***.\n\nAre you paying for these trips? Because, if so, you should probably stop doing that and reevaluate things.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I took an extra week after Christmas while my husband went back to work. I went on a little road trip on my own, he thought it was a great idea. In June he took a few days to go camping while I stayed home and worked. It's important to do things for yourself to keep your mental health in good shape.  It doesn't make you selfish.", "NTA. That's totally fair and I'd use it that way, too. Sometimes it's nice to just recharge without the added hassle of a trip. It's your leave and your decision, especially as you've planned holidays and time off with her, also.", "NTA.\n\n>She mentioned that I was wasting my leave but I pointed out I wasn't wasting it because it's something I would enjoy.\n\nYou're right. Taking time to relax is not a waste.\n\n>She said I should be saving it for things we could do together\n\nIt's nice she wants to spend time with you, but it's also important to take some time off just for you. You don't have to spend every living moment together.\n\n>She just argued that I was being selfish and not thinking about us\n\nYou're not selfish. You're thinking about your wellbeing. If taking some time for yourself is what you need then that is what you should do. Arguably she is the one being selfish because she is using her own preference to undermine yours.\n\nExtroverted people often find it hard to understand that other people need some alone time. I have this issue with some of my friends who simply don't understand why I want to spend some Saturdays by myself.\n\nI don't relax when I go on vacations. I don't relax when I go out with friends and family. I relax when I sit alone in front of a computer playing games. That's just how I am.\n\nIf I was you, I would have a serious talk with your GF about this topic. The sooner the better. Especially if you plan to marry this girl at some point and start a family with her. Otherwise it will come back a bite you hard later in life.", "NTA time to yourself is a perfectly good use of vacation time. Your gf needs to understand that you all don't have to do everything together.", "NTA you deserve some relaxing", "NTA\n\nNot every day off has to be for a trip. If you feel that you would benefit from having 3 additional days off to relax, recharge, recuperate, etc. then those days can actually help you be a \"better\" partner. Exhausted and overwhelmed people seldom do better in healthy relationships than those who aren't. \n\nYou have what sounds like a full year planned of 22 days of all the things she wants to do as a couple. Even if you decided to spend 3 those days in Paris resting without her, you shouldn't feel guilty for doing what you need or want to do with the time off. While it rarely hurts to have a few vacation days saved in reserve, her approach to guilting or belittling you into spending all days off together is a codependent red flag for me.", "NTA\n\nOf course you should use it to relax, it\u2019s your annual leave and you can use it however you want.", "NTA\n\nI have been married for almost 30 years now.  There are times that everyone needs a little time to themselves to relax, unwind, complete projects, etc.\n\nSometimes I take a day or two off work (extended weekend or holiday) and my wife knows I just want to de-stress, relax a little and regain my sanity.  My wife has days she wants to de-stress also and does the same thing.  We try not to bother each other unless it is an emergency.\n\nSometimes people just need time for themselves.", "This sounds like a maturity issue nothing more nothing less.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "Nta. Don't marry a nag.", "No you're not the ah but your girlfriend is.  You are entitled to take a few days to yourself to just relax and not have full schedule of activities (which can be just as tiring)", "NTA. She sounds controlling.", "NTA\n\nShe's selfish", "NTA, she is trying to be very controlling, use your leave the way you want to make your life better.", "NTA... gf is overly controlling. Not saving any time for joint ventures would be selfish but you have 90% of your time off booked together. You should definitely be able to schedule 3 days of your vacation to do your own things or nothing. Also book them off so that you are not given a list of chores.", "NTA. It's actually kind of gross that your parner insists every single spare second has to be spent on giving her attention. I'd keep that in mind when you think of the future", "NTA\n\nI get her thought process on keeping the 3 days in case something comes up, but at the end of the day, these are your days off. You get to decide how to spend them! And honestly a couple days of rest is sometimes necessary. You're not planning to go on a boys weekend. A vegas trip or anything else, you're literally just wanting to take a couple days of rest and relaxation. You may want to figure out why she wants every single day off of yours to be spent with her. Personally I wouldn't like the behaviour and attitude , but to each their own. Still NTA", "NTA and red flag too. Not only just the everything has to be together part but actually mainly her thinking relaxing and doing nothing is a waste.", "NTA but stop talking to her about it. Sounds like you need the occasional vacation from her.  The one being selfish here is your gf literally commanding you what you are allowed to use your vacation time for.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It took me years of therapy to learn that it's OK to take time for yourself, by yourself.   \n It's so important to have time to decompress, have a walkabout, go the the park, a movie, play video games, whatever your favorite activity is - I normally use some of my leave to make long weekends so I can have a Friday or Monday as a \"me\" day to do whatever I'm in the mood for - I joke that it's a day I don't have to speak a word to anyone if I don't want to, lol", "Nta.

If she\u2019s used all her AL for the same time period, for example, her point is moot. Has she *only* used her AL for couple\u2019s trips or activities?
