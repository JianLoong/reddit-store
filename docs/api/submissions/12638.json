{"id": 12638, "submission_id": "11v35fh", "title": "AITA for planting mint?", "selftext": "Last year one of my(40F) partner's(47M) relatives first got very sick and then died. While he was in hospital for several months, we regularly dropped by to look after his house, fix the garden, make sure nothing was amiss and such. \n\nNow, one of the neighbors is a real consolation prize. As she does not like to garden, she had the garden (front and back) of the property she has rented filled up with rocks. I think it's stupid and ugly, but as long as she is happy, more power to her - in HER garden. \n\nSaid neighbor started pestering my partner and me about things she wanted changed in the relative's garden. Bushes cut off, plants removed, that stuff. She also claimed that the way we were gardening was attracting harmful \"bugs\" (which, when I showed them to a friendly biologist, were confirmed to be wood sorrel seeds).\n\nAnyway, I talked everything through with her to confirm what needed doing and removed any plants that were threatening to intrude into her garden (ivy, blackberry etc.). The only thing I did not cut was one hazel branch, as it was in the middle of a dry spell (cutting them then is bad for the plant) and we were planning to relocate the bush anyway. I explained this to her and asked if she could wait until spring. She said it was fine and let me get back to gardening. \n\nThe next time I dropped by, \"someone\" had cut the branch in question. To be clear, legally she was allowed to cut anything growing over her property, and the branch was appeoximately 10 cm across the border. I'm just really annoyed she said it was fine to wait and then hacked at the plant the moment we were not looking. But as my partner's family was worried about the relative, I decided to let it slip and kept taking care of the gardens. (By now we have cut and relocated the hazel, as promised.)\n\nThere was an empty spot in the middle of the relative's front yard, and I decided to put some mint there. In case you do not know, mint is a very useful plant (insects like it, you can make it into tea, it smells delicious and keeps mosquitoes away) - and it's unstoppable. I know it will spread into the neighbor's yard and mess up her peaceful rock paradise, and it is all but impossible to get rid off (it spreads along underground root tendrils).\n\nMy father thinks this is hilarious, obviously I got my petty qualities from him. My partner, on the other hand, thinks I may have been unnecessarily mean. The family plans to sell the property, so by the time this problem becomes obvious we will be long gone.\n\nI have also ordered a bee-friendly mix to freshen up the grass in the back yard, as she complained the grass was too high-growing and we had to rake out most of it. Can't sell a house with a bare-dirt backyard, right?\n\nSo, am I the asshole for planting mint and other bee-friendly plants in our dead relative's garden?", "created_utc": 1679179089, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11v35fh/aita_for_planting_mint/", "score": 455, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I won't say she did it this badly on purpose, but she also put no thought or finesse in it at all.", "We're middle Europe, and mint is found at the edges of the forests.", "The changes were made with permission from the relative while they were still alive (they were hospitalized for several months, and we had been physically caring for them 24/7 before that for several months - that's when I started getting the garden in order whenever I needed to get out of the house for a bit). I even asked them whether I could plant some mint because they love mint tea. Did NOT tell them how outgoing mint is in the world, though.", "There are wide slaps of concrete on three sides of the front yard that the mint should not be able to cross, and a house on the fourth side (the homes share a wall). It should not spread beyond the front yards, and the neighbors on the other side are safe. They are lovely people.", "Not invasive. This kind of mint grows wild at the edge of local forests.", "Yea, it is. Not trying to mess stuff up for everyone. ^^", "From what I have heard, if you could care kudzu to death, you'd have your fortune made.", "The zucchini failure is impressive!", "They need room for their roots, so if you get one, immediately repot them (is that the proper English term? Move it to a bigger pot with good soil.)\n\nA friend of mine kills spider plants, which is impossible, but she is good with orchids. Weird thumbs all around.", "Because MORE CHEMICALS are how they're likely to deal with it, and that's not good for ... anything, really.", "I have green thumbs (my sunflowers grow every year to 4 meters or more, too. ato plants thrive with fruits, and so on) but I put pebbles around my fences, because of the weeds coming from my neighbours. \nBefore the pebbles, I put a double layer of anti-weeds plastic and guess what? The weeds still grow around my fence. They damage the plastic without much issue and grow. \n\nYTA.", "OP do the right thing and get rid of the mint before it has a chance to spread, mint is beneficial *in pots*. Knowingly planting an invasive species cancels out any kind of moral claim you're trying to make with how environmentally friendly you are in comparison to her, when the next person moves in and tries to get rid of her shitty rock garden they're going to be fucked because the mint will have spread underneath it and it'll choke out any new things they try to plant. I've seen people mention that she's going to go ham with pesticides trying to stop it and they're right, you're actively hurting the environment by doing this.", "Keeping it in a pot is the best way to care for mint without having it take over everything else. \ud83d\udc9a", "Yes that's why I said OP was the asshole.  Petty revenge is petty and stupid and you do it because you are being petty and stupid and not thinking very far ahead to consequences.  But also - it's a good petty revenge approach.  Like OP's an asshole, but as far as petty revenge goes this is not going to kill anybody, cause major bodily harm etc.\n\nI base this of course on mint being invasive but not the type of invasive that clogs up riverways or poisons local wildlife.  Managing it would be a pain in the ass but it isn't a hard herb to deal with (i.e. it doesn't have thorns, it isn't turning into a bush, it isn't as fast growing as kudzo, it also doesn't grow into a tree, you can mow it).\n\nBut this is also why I said I'd verify exactly how invasive the mint would get (for example, local environment and climate might naturally stop the spread of the mint beyond irritating the neighbour during the warmer season) and if it was going to be really bad, use native plants that would be annoying for the neighbour but beneficial for the local environment.", "You can actually get mint out of the ground mechanically, but it is kind of complicated. Remove the top layer of soil, put black heavy plastic on top and leave it there for a few months. Without light and moisture, every offshoot even of mint should wither over time. That's how we once got rid of rampant strawberry when I was a kid.", "Too late, I've seen it snaking off already.", "They are forbidden in the town we live in, not (yet?) in the town in question, as far as I know. (Maybe I chose the wrong term, as English is not my native language and I am not necessarily familiar with gardening terms. Basically she had two tons of gravel spread across her yard.", "You are TA. Your behaviour is disgusting.", "Yes, it is. I am a great supporter of environmentally conscious gardening (including the plants on our balcony, unfortunately we do not have our own garden).", "Lemon balm. Years ago we planted lemon balm in the SE corner of my mom\u2019s yard. We later pulled up what we could. But now and then some pops up through cracks in the driveway at the NW corner of her property. There is a *whole house* in between.", "Nta..  In fact you are my hero.", "You shouldn't have agreed to the stupid shit she was asking in the first place.", "Easy one, YTA. You've done something deliberately which you know will cause issues later out of spite.", "YTA because you are making a problem for the future property owner not just the neighbor you dislike.", "Is mint as invasive as kudzu or Japanese knotweed?", "Jasminium beesianum is another invasive plant. Our next door neighbour planted it and it is now springing up all over our garden. Pretty when it flowers but so annoying.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget periwinkle\u2026", "NTA, sure, it's petty and not just a little, but it IS petty as hell. \n\nHOWEVER, it's a good plant, and you can not only make tea with it, you can do a lot of drinks with it, and as you said, it's good for keeping mosquitos away.", "NTA add some tarragon too!", "Mint is great, it\u2019s invasive but not an \u201cinvasive\u201d, NTA", "Yeah... YTA. Youre not just punishing the neighbor, your punishing yourself and the other innocent neighbors and the poor soul that moves in after ya'll leave. In fact, mint can routinly prevent homes from selling if planted in the ground because a lot of people know what kind of problem they cause. Its like walking up to a house to look at and there being a wall of kudzu encroaching on the back yard. Nobody wants that headache and work, they'll just move on to a house without that problem. So really, youre playing yourself.", "NTA. \n\nYou actually have valid reasons for planting the mint. You are not doing it solely for the purpose of upsetting the neighbours. That is just the bonus. \n\nOn your last days in the property, make some mint Julep cocktails while you are finishing the packing and cleaning.", "I, years ago planted lemon mint.  It did not stay in with the rest of the herbs. But, heck it smells great", "You\u2019re intentionally planting an INVASIVE species clearly knowing it\u2019s harmful to the ecosystem. YTA, there\u2019s better ways of messing with your neighbor", "NTA I love the pettieness", "[removed]", "I mean yeah it\u2019s funny and petty but really aren\u2019t you mostly just screwing over the person who buys your deceased relative\u2019s house? Now they\u2019re going to have to deal with a plant that\u2019s nearly impossible to kill PLUS a moody neighbour who is going to constantly bitch at them for said plant, *that they didn\u2019t even plant*. I\u2019m going YTA for not thinking through the fallout from your pettiness", "Well, she was right that stuff was growing onto her property. Legally she could just have removed it herself, but she explained she did not like gardening I agreed to get everything back onto the relative's property because everything is huddled so close together and you have to get along. So yes, I was going out of my way to please her, but I was looking out for ourselves when doing this.", "It's a native species, if that's what you're asking, but very difficult to get rid of.", "It's not invasive, it's native to the area. Just hard to get rid of.

I can never grow mint successfully. If it's this invasive, surely it should be hardy!", "I kinda like my invasive blackberries \ud83d\ude09 currently have a corner full of white flowers. Can't wait for cobbler, yummy!", "Ecological definition, when speaking in gardening terms invasive refers to a plant that's rampant, difficult to get rid of, and can harm other plants.
