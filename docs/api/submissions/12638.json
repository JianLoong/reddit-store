{"id": 12638, "submission_id": "11v35fh", "title": "AITA for planting mint?", "selftext": "Last year one of my(40F) partner's(47M) relatives first got very sick and then died. While he was in hospital for several months, we regularly dropped by to look after his house, fix the garden, make sure nothing was amiss and such. \n\nNow, one of the neighbors is a real consolation prize. As she does not like to garden, she had the garden (front and back) of the property she has rented filled up with rocks. I think it's stupid and ugly, but as long as she is happy, more power to her - in HER garden. \n\nSaid neighbor started pestering my partner and me about things she wanted changed in the relative's garden. Bushes cut off, plants removed, that stuff. She also claimed that the way we were gardening was attracting harmful \"bugs\" (which, when I showed them to a friendly biologist, were confirmed to be wood sorrel seeds).\n\nAnyway, I talked everything through with her to confirm what needed doing and removed any plants that were threatening to intrude into her garden (ivy, blackberry etc.). The only thing I did not cut was one hazel branch, as it was in the middle of a dry spell (cutting them then is bad for the plant) and we were planning to relocate the bush anyway. I explained this to her and asked if she could wait until spring. She said it was fine and let me get back to gardening. \n\nThe next time I dropped by, \"someone\" had cut the branch in question. To be clear, legally she was allowed to cut anything growing over her property, and the branch was appeoximately 10 cm across the border. I'm just really annoyed she said it was fine to wait and then hacked at the plant the moment we were not looking. But as my partner's family was worried about the relative, I decided to let it slip and kept taking care of the gardens. (By now we have cut and relocated the hazel, as promised.)\n\nThere was an empty spot in the middle of the relative's front yard, and I decided to put some mint there. In case you do not know, mint is a very useful plant (insects like it, you can make it into tea, it smells delicious and keeps mosquitoes away) - and it's unstoppable. I know it will spread into the neighbor's yard and mess up her peaceful rock paradise, and it is all but impossible to get rid off (it spreads along underground root tendrils).\n\nMy father thinks this is hilarious, obviously I got my petty qualities from him. My partner, on the other hand, thinks I may have been unnecessarily mean. The family plans to sell the property, so by the time this problem becomes obvious we will be long gone.\n\nI have also ordered a bee-friendly mix to freshen up the grass in the back yard, as she complained the grass was too high-growing and we had to rake out most of it. Can't sell a house with a bare-dirt backyard, right?\n\nSo, am I the asshole for planting mint and other bee-friendly plants in our dead relative's garden?", "created_utc": 1679179089, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11v35fh/aita_for_planting_mint/", "score": 150, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
