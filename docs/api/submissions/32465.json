Reapproach this again, think about your reasons, have a calm conversation, and find a way to get yourself back on track. I think one of the main points is what you already mentioned in the comments, that you haven't written anything or picked a book in 4 months. Obviously, this form of education is not working for you.\n\nBTW, going to school is not only book education, it is also about making friends, social skills, sports, clubs, etc. Please don't miss out.", "NTA.\n\nGoing to school isn\u2019t just about academics, it\u2019s also about socialisation and learning to interact in the world. If the quality of the education you are getting at home isn\u2019t at least good, it\u2019s probably doing you a disservice.\n\nAre there other trusted adults you could talk to, and help you advocate for yourself?

Sounds like your mom isn't doing this and doing you a great disservice. How will you be able to obtain your high school diploma?\n\nWhat does your mother expect you to do when you \"finish\" high school cause lord knows you won't get a diploma.\n\nSome schools allow you to take, online, courses through the local community/junior college allowing you to get your diploma and an associates degree at the same time. Look into it yourself, don't ask your mom cause I fear she may sabotage you.", "That isn't homeschooling, that's parental neglect.\n\nI'm not a huge advocate of homeschooling but there can be situations where it's the best option or there are no realistic other options. However unless there are major barriers (for example you have a chronic illness and have been too unwell to learn) you should be studying something. Your parents should also be trying enable you form social connections outside your immediate family too,which it sounds like they aren't.\n\nYou don't have to say why you are being homeschooled but from what you've written here I'm questioning whether there is any good reason for it at all and whether it's still a good choice because it really sounds like you're being failed and missing out on both your education and a normal life.", "I see from your other comments that you\u2019re going to wait for college, but September is far away and that\u2019s a very long time to be feeling so low and unmotivated.

You're 15 so there's definitely still time to go to school for them. There's no shame in getting them a bit later. I'm a year older in my uni year (if that makes sense) for basically this reason.\n\nIf you don't have GCSEs or A Levels, you will need some kind of other education to be independent. More education = easier to get a job = easier to be financially independent, which is your key to being independent long term. I was homeschooled and educationally neglected, and clawed my way up to a university education. Don't give up on education for yourself, it's the way out.

Is it Foundations, Apprenticeship, Access or something else?", "You could actually go to college now if you wanted. I'm in the UK and I home schooled all my kids and then they went to college at 14 because some colleges do an entry course for home educated students and if you pass the exam, you get in. My now 16 year old got in at 14, is now on his 3rd year and has just started performing arts. If you search home ed college courses on the internet, you should be able to find some colleges that will accept you under 16. Not all colleges do it, though. My daughter's did the same and one of them is now doing a law degree. I have a 4 year old I will start home eding next year and I intend to do the same with him and send him to college when he's 14.", "Post - 16 college in UK would normally expect incoming students to have some GCSEs or other exam passed already, though.

They will likely have open days or even taster days you can go to with course and careers advice. You may even be able to take/retake GCSES. If you check their online prospectus, it should advise which courses they offer and what qualifications you need to take them. Many vocational courses, or apprenticeships (e.g. mechanic, brick laying, hairdressing) will likely not need any qualifications as long as do extra classes in core skills (maths/english).  You should contact the college as they may have special provision for home schooled pupils.", "Nah, not any more. As well as being able to take GCSE's directly at college, there are foundations and access courses for people without any qualifications that don't lead to GCSE'S. They're often a kind of entrance course to a more specific vocational qualification but some are  essential skills courses for those who would find GCSE's difficult. \n\nThere are a lot of kids who leave school with no qualifications but thankfully there are options for them.", "There are two things that can be called foundation studies and don't need GCSE's. The one I think you're applying to is a course with maths, English, employment skills, how to manage your time etc. A general get started course for people without GCSE's. Is that right?\n\nContact the college. Tell them you're applying to their foundation studies course, that you've been homeschooled and don't have anyone to ask. Colleges have people there just to help you, with your application and explaining how it all works. Tell them you're not getting any education at home right now. They will have met lots of people like you and know how to help.\n\nNone of this is your fault. I know you don't want to upset your mum and I get it. But she made some big mistakes here. Making sure you get an education is her job as a mum (and your dad). If she wants to homeschool you it's her job to make you pick up your books, even when you don't want to. \n\nYou didn't do anything wrong. Homeschooling isn't working. You were honest and your dad is being a knobhead trying to make you feel guilty about that.\n\nThis is not your fault. You are actually awesome for finding a college course and thinking to find a way out of this. That tells me you can definitely get some qualifications studying in a better environment, like at college.", "alright thank you so much", "okay thank you!", "As a European, I find the concept of homeschooling insane.

My mom was a good teacher too, I just didn't have the same experiences as my peers going into college, and felt overwhelmed, especially by math and essay-writing which I was miserably behind on.

I also do not know the laws about having to have schooling.\n\nAgain, in USA, by law, you have to go to school or be schooled. If the schooling stops at home, your parents are legally required to put you back in the government school system. \n\nIt sounds like maybe you are motivated to want to go to University but maybe not so motivated to learn on your own or go get some schooling? Is it hard to get to or not available? This may be a thing you have start doing for yourself on your own (just like you would in University), just a lot sooner that you thought you would.\n\nSorry and I hope it works out. I see a lot of people giving advice, I hope it helps!", "I was homeschooled and I hated it.  I wish I hadn't done it. BUT at least my parents actually took responsibility for it: they constantly made sure I was doing my work, they helped me when I couldn't understand things, they marked my tests, they tried to teach me Algebra (it didn't go well, bc I have dyscalculia, which is a learning disability related to math, but it least they tried!).\n\nI hated it, but at least they were extremely involved in making sure I got through it and graduated.\n\nThat is a parent's responsibility if they choose to homeschool their kid. If your parent decides to have you homeschool, they are taking on the *responsibility* to make sure you actually are getting through the schoolwork!  That is now their job!  \n\nSure, some kids choose to drop out of school, and for some people that's the best choice for them! But it's not right for it to not truly be your choice, because you don't really have many options.  You haven't asked your parents to stop going to school and made a calculated decision about it. \n\nIt's absolutely ridiculous for them to have just stopped teaching you, for them to just shrug and leave you in a situation where you now have to worry about whether you can get into college. If they aren't able to teach you in a way that works, then it is their responsibility to get you into other schooling.  They can't just mess up and refuse to acknowledge it.\n\nIt is absolutely ridiculous for your mom to be *hurt* because you aren't absolutely thrilled that they screwed up your education.  She has no right to be *hurt* over being reminded that she has done you a disservice.  I think that's what it is, in part - she's guilty, and in denial, and doesn't want to have to acknowledge it. She wants to be able to ignore what she's done, and not have to deal with it.\n\nAlso, please check out some info about things like depression, etc. Just because I recognise a lot of Tye feelings you're describing (not just about homeschooling, but in general).", "Serious question because I honestly don't know. OP is from the UK, do they have community/junior colleges there?", "It's up to your parents to meet you where you are, figure out what's wrong and remedy it, even if that means putting you in regular school. They didn't do that. This is educational neglect on their part. \n\nIf you're not doing anything it could be depression, anxiety about your future, boredom, lack of social stimulation or any one of a dozen other things. It's up to the adults in your life to get you the help you need. It's not up to the kid to figure it all out on their own while holding all their emotions in so their parents don't have to fell bad about their failure to address the situation appropriately. I'm not trash talking your parents, just stating facts.\n\nHope college works out better for you. I think you'll find the intellectual stimulation you need there.", "a lot of kids don't like learning and don't want to do school - that's why they go to school with teachers whose job it is to get them excited about learning, and motivate them to do their work (sometimes by discipline, like getting detention if you skip too much class)  \nyou are not stupid or lazy, and its totally normal for someone your age to not be motivated for school. if you WANT to get motivated, maybe try some things that already interest you (for example, i liked greek mythology, so i read about it and then read about the culture and found out i like history, and that's what i studied. it doesnt have to be history, ofc, but there is SOMETHING you are passionate about and want to learn more about, you just have to find it)  \nalso, teachers are trained to teach students who aren't motivated or don't care, they don't give up. that's why your parents were unqualified to homeschool you, and clearly did a bad job. \n\nteach yourself stuff!
