Think about what you don\u2019t like about your education currently, then think about what you would like about being at school. I loved school, but it failed me in some ways during early education particularly. It was right for me to have 2 years at home then go back to a public school. I plan to send my son to school and home ed him if there are issues that lead me that way, but it has to be done in a way that works for the teacher and pupil(s) at home.

It's a spectrum and if you can control your education, you may want to start reaching for higher things.

It's called communication.
