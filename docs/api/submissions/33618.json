One of our neighbours is in her 60s. She uses an electric scooter to get around because she has had something wrong with her leg since we moved in but we have both seen her walking around on a few occasions. \n\nWhen we moved in she let us know that the bins go out every sunday. We thought she was just letting us know to be kind but now i\u2019m thinking it\u2019s so we know to put hers out. Every sunday morning she puts her bins outside our house. She has never once asked us to put them out, and never said thanks for the times we did put them out. She\u2019s also gone through our mail multiple times which has made me resent her because wtf. She has visitors EVERY weekend (and every day) and they never put her bins out, it always has to be us or one of the other neighbours. We have stopped putting them out for her and so one of our other neighbours has started doing it. We are the only people out of all the neighbours who rent, it shouldn\u2019t be our responsibility.

She might be under the impression you\u2019ve agreed at some point or thought someone told you you\u2019ll need to do it. \n\nSpeak to her, not Reddit.", "NTA. It\u2019s her responsibility to ask someone to take her bins to the curb and since you were never asked that person isn\u2019t you.   \n\n\nIf you ever catch her reading your mail again tell her that it\u2019s illegal and you will press charges if she does it again.", "Nta, probably explain it to the other neighbour who is putting out the rubbish so they can make an informed decision if to continue, potentially do it anonymously (a letter or something ) I would also get something to record your mailbox and seek legal advice on what to do next because it's illegal and messed up", "ESH. \n\nYour neighbor should have asked if you would be willing to help her out with the bins. She certainly shouldn\u2019t be going through your mail.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to do it, you should have told her directly. It seems like the problem of the bins has been solved since a different neighbor is doing it. But you might have a new neighborhood problem - being known as the assholes who wouldn\u2019t help a mobility impaired old woman with a simple and minor task.\n\nWhether you have a strict duty to do something is a poor and incomplete determiner of whether you are being ethical and kind. And your status as owner or renter doesn\u2019t affect the determination. You can usually choose three ways to approach a situation: do good, act neutrally, or do evil. Acting neutrally, as you are doing here (not my trash, not my responsibility) may insulate you from being seen as asshole here on Reddit, but don\u2019t walk around thinking that you are a good person. \n\nThere is value in community, though we don\u2019t often think of it, and an unspoken social contract to it. What expectations or hopes do you have of your neighbors? That they call the police if they see someone breaking into your vehicle? That they let you know if one of your pets is out? That they keep the noise down when they are having parties? Do you think they will continue to act neighborly toward you when you have opted out of doing so?
