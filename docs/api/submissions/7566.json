What does it mean to you. \n\nAlways try to argue in the positive. Not shouldn't I get a say too? Argue from what it means to you and what she would gain from it. \n\nBecause I'm partly on her side here. When you destroy your body and risk your life you can have more of a \"say\"", "This will turn into a controlling relationship and that baby will be so entitiled in the future this is bad red flags all over", "INFO\nYou want just your last name in the kid?", "NTA. you 100% have a say. I'm sorry your girlfriend is so selfish and inconsiderate.", "NTA She just showed you her true self. Run ASAP. She is very controlling and you would have a horrible life with her.", "Look, whether her opinion is right or now (which it isn't), she's told you this is something that she expects out of motherhood. Now that you've discovered this is something she's not budging on, you need to either accept it, or just break up and find a different partner who has life plans that are more compatible with yours.", "NTA\n\nYou don't have any say in the name, you don't have any need to make one with her.  SImple.  Leave.", "No but your girlfriend is..Do you really want an unbending person to be the mother of your children? NTA", "NTA", "Run dude. Just run before you make a life long mistake.", "Ummmm.... man you need to re-think this life-plan.  And who you plan to live it with.\n\nHer solely taking over the naming is just the tip of the iceberg of what's to come.\n\nAnd baby names should ALWAYS require two \"yesses,\" and one \"no\" is enough to veto the choice.\n\nNTA.  And please PLEASE give this a good hard think.", "NTA - she's showing you who she is, believe her and RUN!", "NTA.  Things like a child's name are usually a \"Two yes, One No\" situation (each parent has veto right), but it doesn't give them the right to just blanket-refuse all suggestions by the other party because they want to dictate every aspect.\n\nGiven what you've described, I'd have a long hard think if I were you about if this is the person you REALLY want to have a child with, especially if you want to have significant involvement in their life without her hovering overhead like a helicopter-mama.", "nta, names should be something thats agreed apon by both parents, and pray tell they better think about what they are doing with the name. you dont what your child hating you for their name (i hate my parents for my name, cause it is one of the factors that has gotten me bullied my entire life even in adulthood)   \n\n\nnow here is what you do, if your girlfriend wont let you have a say in naming the kid just dont give her a kid, and if thats a game breaker for the relationship maybe its better to get another girlfriend.", "NAH\n\nTotally fine for you to want input.\n\nBut you guys are even engaged, much less married\u2026  so it\u2019s extremely likely that she will end up spending a lot more time with any kid(s) that result from this relationship.", "NTA. Tell her the baby will have 50% of your DNA and that gives you the right to have a say in the baby naming.  If she still thinks it is only her right you need different girlfriend.", "NTA don\u2019t have a baby with her she\u2019s going to use the fact that she\u2019s the one that incubated and birthed this child as ammo against you to undermine your right to parent your child forever. You have just as much say. This is your child too. This is the tiniest tip of the iceberg here. My husband ABSOLUTELY had a say in helping choose our children\u2019s names. In fact he was pretty set on having his dad\u2019s name be our son\u2019s middle name and I respected that. He basically chose both names because as we were discussing names he came up with both first names and we liked the sound of them and agreed on them. Our son\u2019s he basically chose because he had a first name he liked and when we out it with the middle name I realized it was perfect. With our daughter we couldn\u2019t figure out a name so he said \u201cwhat about this one\u2026\u201d and I put it with a middle name I liked and viola! We had her name\u2026it only took until 2 days after she was born to figure it out \ud83d\ude02.", "Get a new girlfriend.", "Um I wouldn\u2019t trust her to even compromise now and follow through in the future. She sounds very controlling and like the type of mom who wouldn\u2019t involve you in other major decisions about the baby\u2019s life like religion, schooling and medical choices. I\u2019d just leave now and find someone more respectful and let her find the doormat she clearly wants. \n\nNta", "NTA\n\nShe is waving a huge flag in your face and it\u2019s red.", "If you are the father and with your wife you are going to raise this child,  I would think it would be a joint effort.   Her position doesn't sound fair.", "Sounds like there's not a lot of respect from her.  You may want to rethink this relationship. \n\nIf therapy doesn't lead to results of real consultation,  don't get her pregnant. \n\nNames are permanent reminders of decisions in this situation. She's not thinking this through. \n\nNTA", "NTA.. i mean, unless your middle name is like Ebenezer or something. My vote will always go for Chalupa Batman.", "Mom here. Names should require two yes-es. If she thinks she is the only parent because she gave birth, you shouldn't have kids with her.  There are a few things mom gets absolute final say on because they involve her body: breastfeeding, who to let into the room when she gives birth (excluding dad takes a really good reason, but if she doesn't want Mother in law that is her choice.) She also gets to make decisions on what to eat and do when pregnant (less things that are really serious - morning coffee, which won't seriously hurt the baby but might be important, is her call, getting drunk or using drugs does open her up to your input.) But name absolutely should be decided by both of you.", "NTA\n\nTell her since that is her final say, then you guess that if you and her were to continue on, you will have to get a vasectomy and thus no children at all.  That way you will be sterilized and there won't be a child to name.\n\nBottom line is that the father has as much right to name and have input on the name of the child and that both parents need to be willing to compromise and agree with such a name.  If it is unilateral, then chances are one or the other will feel slighted and may not be so anxious to have children at all with said person.\n\nYou may want to relook at your relationship, as chances are there are other red flags that you are not seeing.", "Question, is the child getting a last name from you or the mother? Or is it hyphenated?", "You are absolutely not the asshole. Naturally, she is the one giving birth but it is still your child and you are equally a father as she is the mother of that child, so you should have a say in naming your child.\n\nHonestly, if I were you, I would reconsider wanting a family with that girl because if she truly believes you shouldn't have any say in naming your child, she could be excluding you from much bigger stuff that usually needs to be communicated to form any conclusion involving having/creating a family.", "NTA but I would avoid having children with someone this self-centered.", "This is ridiculous. What I was talking before about weaponizing pregnancy. Abs she isn't even yet. NTA", "This!!! Though naming babies can be hard ... My husband did get to pick out middle names and we both had to like the first name! And to prove it.... One our daughters (we had girls) middle name is Rogue and if you ask if it's \"like the car\" or star wars.... We can't be friends!!! I agreed only because she was the best X- Men circa the 90's cartoon!!!", "Yeah, OP should find a more reasonable GF as a partner", "This!   OP this doesn\u2019t sound like consensus building.  Sounds like her way or no way.  Doesn\u2019t bode well for future discussions regarding baby raising", "Right?! Like dude yall are fighting over the hypothetical, that's a pretty good sign not to keep going forward", "I'm not understanding your comment.  Are you saying that she could/should somehow be forced to have more children than she wants to birth?  Or that she would have abortions if she conceived more possible children than she wanted to have?", "I note that he\u2019s not her husband.", "Are you really comparing both things, how idiot you need to be?", "Thats a really good option but we all know this kind of people prefer biological children, sadly.", "RUN was my exact thought too. We have 5 children and we BOTH decided on our children\u2019s first and middle names. She is controlling and it will lead to much bigger parenting issues later.", "Mom here and I literally said the same. This will be the same kind of woman who will then complain about how their husband never helps and is a clueless dad but never acknowledge it was because she wouldn\u2019t let him be involved and constantly criticized what he did  so he gave up trying.", "No I meant to type she might not let him have a say in how they are raised. Not how many", "What's her perspective on the rest of parenting decisions cause it doesn't sound like she's going to treat you as a parent that has has equal say over much", "\"a say\" doesn't mean a unilateral decision. Of course you don't get to decide the name if she doesn't like it.\n\nYou both get a say. Neither of you get to decide on a name the other doesn't like. \n\nI'm pregnant and yes I'm putting my body through things my partner isn't. But I'm doing it because i want children. Its not a chore it's my choice.\n\nI get to make decisions about my own body - it's my pregnancy, I decide whether I drink a half glass of wine or not. But he still has a say about our child even when it's in my belly, even though I ultimately decide these things because it's my body. \nBut he's my partner. If he really Was worried about my occasional half glass of wine, I wouldn't do it.  Because I respect him. I trust this man to coparent my kids, I should trust him to give me input now \n\nOnce the child is born and when it comes to naming him, I am an equal parent. I don't get bonus shit for being pregnant. A good partner like the one I have makes an effort to pick up the slack and make it easier for me.", "Then you shouldn't have to do diapers or night time feedings or go to the pediatrician. She will regret such a division of labor (pun intended).", "So, you only won\u2019t get a say if it is a name she doesn\u2019t like? You get a say if she does like the name?\n\nSounds to me like she hates your middle name.", "Tell her she's putting your brain through it.", "Good point.", "Listen to yourself, you are afraid of talking about the future because your partner might get angry.  There is no better sign than that.  The relationship just died, some people miss this, and keep everything on life support just hoping that the relationship will revive and be good again.  It never will, it is dead, and you would do well to get clear before it takes you down too.", "You\u2019re going to threaten to be a deadbeat dad? How is that a point?", "And what if you just have daughters?", "All big decisions should be two yes or one no. That\u2019s what partners do.", "Either one, tbh", "Okay.  Makes sense now.  Thanks.", "Very true", "It's also \"time to ensure your child's only career path is \\*not\\* exotic dancer\". \n\nComing from a retired former dancer. Avoiding examples to maybe avoid the flames heading my way ;)", "Because this isn't a fault. This is how she is. How she treats him.", "That's quite hilarious", "Middle school, high school, post secondary, life. Mean girls everywhere that I keep having to scratch names off the list.", "He's tried talking to her. She won't budge."]}
