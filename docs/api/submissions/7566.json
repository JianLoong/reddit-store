I'm sure if you step back and look at your relationship, you'll find additional instances of her \"laying down the law\" and being unwilling to compromise.\n\nI can't help but wonder, how many more times will she bring up that she was the one who was pregnant and gave birth in order to get her way.\n\n* You don't get to pick out which religion the baby will be raised with, I was the one who suffered, so I get to make the decision.\n* Of course we'll spend every holiday with my parents.  After all, I'm the one who gave birth, so my wishes are more important.\n* I don't care that you've had your cat for 10 years, I'm pregnant and I don't want it here anymore.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nPlease reconsider this relationship.", "NTA\n\nGTFO, this is not someone you want in a partnership", "I think she posted earlier today.

If mom wants a home birth, dad can't veto.  If mom only wants her mom there and not her MIL, she gets final say.

This is just the start.  She will control everything to do with the baby all because she birthed it, and you'll be on the outside looking in.  Don't have kids with this woman if you want to be a hands on dad.  If she was sweet, and kind, she would not being this controlling over a name.\n\nBtw, I am a mom so I'm not just spewing stuff.

I would joke with my husband too, if I carried the babies, I get to name them. But it was A JOKE!  We named all 4 of them together.    Either she needs therapy or she needs a new father of her children\u2026 she doesn\u2019t get both.

The naming of a child is usually a fun time when the parents talk about family history, older family members they love, names they\u2019ve always liked, how it will affect the child in public settings, etc\u2026 this just sounds strangely self-absorbed in a way that doesn\u2019t bode well for your future together.", "This is key.

You're taking what could be talked about and resolved and turning it into something OP immediately needs to dump the person. Not every situation is like yours. While it is a red flag the advise should not be to cut and run at the first sign of trouble especially if they do enjoy being with one another.", "i mean yes, i agree, it CAN be a flag.  but we don't have enough context to understand why she is being so rigid.  maybe it is just this one thing that she is set on because she feels it's her \"right as a mother\".  being misguided on this one topic doesn't necessarily mean she doesn't see him as an equal.   all i'm saying."]}
