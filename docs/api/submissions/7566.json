I'd heavily think about if you want to actually spend your life with her if this is how she thinks/behaves. \n\nShe may be giving birth, but she wouldn't be doing that without you. The child is 50% from the mother and 50% from the father, so you have just as much right over naming (and every other decision about) the child.\n\nIf that's her thinking then you wouldn't be financially responsible for it either. Bring that up and see her thoughts on it...", "\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "Dude earlier today (and I suspect the same thing will happen in this next class) I was so tired taking notes that when I looked down it was just gibberish.", "Just say NO to drugs. :)", "Good point, it is for the child. OP needs to drop his middle name here, so we can see if he\u2019s being an AH or not. Like\u2026.if this man\u2019s middle name is Herbert or Herman, he\u2019s an AH.", "OP sounds like a doormat.

But man we got cedar and ragweed going crazy right now.", "While I agree this sub is very quick to suggest splitting up, this is one of the scenarios where it's 100% the correct answer. They're not married, they have no kids, and she's failing at one of the most basic and fundamental aspects of a relationship (and, dare I say, life in general): compromise.\n\nYou can't fix people, and at the stage OP is currently in, you shouldn't even try. Even if he successfully gets her to see the light on this issue, there's basically zero chance she takes the necessary logical leaps and applies the lesson to the rest of their relationship. He's in for what could only be described as an uphill battle for the rest of his life. It's simply not worth the trouble.", "Shhhh, I'm sure someone on here will decide you're really not allergic to them. :)", "Right.... I wish.

Then after a while have your husband tell them you're only sending garbled texts."]}
