As a mother of three children, under no circumstances what I find it acceptable to tell my husband to piss off if he wanted to help name our children. Actually, he's the one who came up with the names for our children. Giving birth is obviously incredible and a lot of hard work, but those children are your lineage as well. You both grow them into the people that they're going to be together, it's not just her.", "NTA Naming children should be two yes, one no. She may be birthing the baby but it\u2019s also your kid. You should get to have input as well. If she\u2019s hard lining that, I wouldn\u2019t have kids with her.

Education?  Religion?", "NTA, at all!!!!!  You are a parent too.

It is unreasonable that she does not see it as coparenting and you need to do with that information what you will and figure out if you are compatible and if you want to have a relationship with a power dynamic is that one-sided. It seems like you would be fighting her for life for a place in your own family.", "NTA. \n\n\nAnd it's great you are having these conversations now before marriage and children are things you need to handle. \n\n\nShe can't have your child without you. Not willing to come to a compromise over something like that - while it may not make or break a marriage - it would be something that would eat on you for a long time.  Perhaps it is time to have all the hard hitting conversations to decided if you compatible enough to make a marriage work. ... because I know with my partner - naming our kids was something important he wanted to do together.", "NTA, your girlfriend is delusional. Does she know how biology works? The man also produces the chromosome to determine if the baby is a boy or girl.

Remind her that with responsibilities also comes the rights.", "NTA. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t give the baby my last name or sign the birth certificate, if I had no rights or say in the naming of my child.

But then again, I don't like naming traditions in general; traditions are peer pressure from dead people. \n\nIf you really like that middle name, I feel like you need to advocate for it on the grounds of more than just a family tradition that she's not even a part of yet.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Her telling you that she would have the only say in naming of a future baby is just wrong.\n\nHer attitude on this should be sending up huge red flags.

I don't know if you are being intentionally obtuse or not but the generational name is incredibly likely to be the issue here. Not you having an opinion but you not having an opinion. Reusing a name because it's traditional might sound cool to you but we are at a point in history where women are attempting to break from an unfavorable past. \n\nBy agreeing to raise a family with a modern woman at all (putting p in v) you are in a position to raise hope in this women that the autonomy and individual future of this child is important in your heart. \n\nSo when you say hey I want to name my kid this cause it's mine you are going to set off alarms. The kid is not your kid, the kid is a new person.

This is just the start of decades of caring for a child.\n\nI would ask her if she also expects to take every decision concerning the child, decide on parenting rules and such?

I\u2019m gonna try and talk to her about it again.", "Honestly I feel like if I bring that point up she\u2019ll just get pissed so idk I might tho", "I just feel like if it\u2019s my kid too, I\u2019ll be raising it too. She says she doesn\u2019t want me to pick a bad name/ old name/ outdated name so I don\u2019t get a say. \n\nI just asked her if i could make the middle name of one our sons my middle name, which I got from my father. It\u2019s not particularly old but it\u2019s not really common nowadays but by no means is it weird lmao. I just feel disrespected tbh", "Where is that said or implied?", "You realize that many couples . . . wait for it . . . have the same last name!", "Get out of that relationship. You don't need to have a baby with someone this immature or with these views ever. It's ridiculous. GET OUT NOW WHILE YOU CAN. NTA she is TA", "The name isn't *for* her. It's not a *consolation prize* for the hardship of pregnancy. It's for *the child.* And when it comes to the child you would be *coequal* parents. She absolutely the primary for the pregnancy and should get some measure of consideration and accommodation from her partner. But naming the child is something you absolutely get an **equal** say in. It's quite literally the first *decision* you'll make as parents about *your* child.\n\nAs AITA will often say, it's a Two-Yes, One-No situation. She is *right* that she can veto a name she doesn't like, absolutely. But so can you -- and you both have to agree on whatever is ultimately chosen.\n\nAnd if you can't manage to come together on something so mundane, then you absolutely should not even consider for one *second* actually having a child. Because agreeing on a name is one of the easiest conflicts you'll navigate as parents together.", ">I don\u2019t get a say if it\u2019s gonna be a name she doesn\u2019t like.\n\nIn the original post it sounds like she is boxing you out completely, and she wants to unilaterally name the child, which would be unreasonable.  But with the above, it sounds more like she is vetoing a name she doesnt like, which is quite reasonable. \n\nSo, have you suggested anything other than passing on your middle name?  Because if she doesnt like that, she does get to say no.  And you get to decide if you can live with that.  But she is only being super disrespectful towards you if she is shooting down everything you suggest.  Contary, if you are insisting on your middle name even if she doesnt like it, you are being rather disrespectful towards her.", "So what if she gets pissed? She can't disrespect you and expect you to continually take it, if she won't let up about this I'd very much rethinking having any children with her. She may be carrying the child but that doesn't mean her word is end all be all. If that were the case then she should be responsible for everything that kid needs and not look to you for anything, but that's not how things work around these parts. Parenting is supposed to be 50/50.", "You feel disrespected because you are being disrespected. The conversation needs to be had that you will be an equal coparent in any relationship you see yourself having a child in and if she doesn\u2019t see herself having the kind of relationship where you are partners in responsibilities you don\u2019t see a future in the relationship."]}
