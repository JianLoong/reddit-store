Your local paper might carry an obituary, but its not always done these days.

However, nothing feels better then total one of the extremes.  Those are to tell a blatant lie or the absolute truth.  \n\nSo naturally they lie to you about grandfather with the expectations that it's \"fine.\"\nWhich now has created a situation. They choose the lie. You choose to just tell the truth; where you expect a certified copy of your grandfather death certificate.  \n\nThe solution is for each side to develop an understanding and respect for boundaries.\n\nEdit: grammar and clarification.\n\nEdit: change verdict from NAH to NTA.  \n\nBased on revelation of new information.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou don't want to see your grandfather,  \nwhich is your prerogative, and which your family should also respect.  \n\n\nSince the trust is broken already, there is no problem is being rude by asking his death certificate.  \n\n\nPS  \n\n\nThey can also fake death certificates.  \nSo it is better to get a proof in the format of a obituary picture published in a newspaper and trying to verify if that has been actually published.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
