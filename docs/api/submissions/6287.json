You shouldn't have to fave your abuser or subject your children to that.", "NTA, It would be poof of him not being there, I find it disrespectful if they try and trick you into it.", "NTA , If I had to face a person who have been abusive towards me , I would have the same reaction too.

Obviously, it would be a shitty lie to make, claiming a family member was dead when he wasn't, but it is not unknown for people to make this lie.\n\nIf you want to verify it yourself, there are other ways. Your local paper might carry an obituary, but its not always done these days. You could try enquiring with the local funeral directors, but that is not so easy if it is a large area/city with multiple in operation. The local records office could be your best option. That way, you could verify the information without pushing your immediate family (who may be grieving).", "NTA\nIs always amazing how the people who did not suffer are willing to forgive the perpetrators and burdening the victims.", "NTA.  Your family already lied to you once about whether he would be at an event. I imagine that travelling to this country isn't a short trip.  Why expose yourself and your family to thos negativity.  Take your family to see the country without making plans to meet with family there.  I work with some guys from the Philippines that get begged for money when they go there to visit.  It wrecks their vacation.  I know it isn't the same as abuse but they have found that just visiting the country without visiting family is way better for them.", "NTA- I was like this prior to my mother passing.

But if they think that lying to you will open the heavens and a angel of mercy will descend from the heavens to cleanse everyone's hearts of pain.....\n\nDoubtful.....\n\nWhy the NAH? Everyone has expectations.  They form those expectations based on there understanding and try to impose there will onto others based on these expectations.  \n\nI am giving people the benefit of the doubt.  \n\nIt's similar to white lies people tell to avoid conflict.  Like the lies that a fitness fanatic tells a morbidly obese person about there appearance and trying not to disrespect or hurt thier obese person.  \nYes, there are ways to say things in a respectful and productive manner.  However, nothing feels better then total one of the extremes.  Those are to tell a blatant lie or the absolute truth.  \n\nSo naturally they lie to you about grandfather with the expectations that it's \"fine.\"\nWhich now has created a situation. They choose the lie. You choose to just tell the truth; where you expect a certified copy of your grandfather death certificate.  \n\nThe solution is for each side to develop an understanding and respect for boundaries.\n\nEdit: grammar and clarification.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou don't want to see your grandfather,  \nwhich is your prerogative, and which your family should also respect.  \n\n\nSince the trust is broken already, there is no problem is being rude by asking his death certificate.  \n\n\nPS  \n\n\nThey can also fake death certificates.  \nSo it is better to get a proof in the format of a obituary picture published in a newspaper and trying to verify if that has been actually published.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
