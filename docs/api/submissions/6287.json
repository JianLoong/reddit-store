They've manipulated you and lied to you in the past about whether he would be at the wedding or not, and they clearly don't think that your grandfather's abuse was a big enough deal to worry about today. If you need to know for sure you won't have to see him again, either a death certificate or an obituary in their local newspaper would definitely do the trick!", "NTA. You shouldn't have to fave your abuser or subject your children to that.", "NTA, It would be poof of him not being there, I find it disrespectful if they try and trick you into it.", "NTA , If I had to face a person who have been abusive towards me , I would have the same reaction too.  And after all the times your family have lied to you , I wouldn't blame you for asking for proof .", "NTA\n\nYou have the right to set boundaries and stick to them.", "NTA, it is understandable that you want verification after being lied to previously. Obviously, it would be a shitty lie to make, claiming a family member was dead when he wasn't, but it is not unknown for people to make this lie.\n\nIf you want to verify it yourself, there are other ways. Your local paper might carry an obituary, but its not always done these days. You could try enquiring with the local funeral directors, but that is not so easy if it is a large area/city with multiple in operation. The local records office could be your best option. That way, you could verify the information without pushing your immediate family (who may be grieving).", "NTA\nIs always amazing how the people who did not suffer are willing to forgive the perpetrators and burdening the victims.", "NTA.  Your family already lied to you once about whether he would be at an event. I imagine that travelling to this country isn't a short trip.  Why expose yourself and your family to thos negativity.  Take your family to see the country without making plans to meet with family there.  I work with some guys from the Philippines that get begged for money when they go there to visit.  It wrecks their vacation.  I know it isn't the same as abuse but they have found that just visiting the country without visiting family is way better for them.", "NTA- I was like this prior to my mother passing. Anytime any type of anything was brought up, my response was always either \u201cnot if she\u2019s there\u201d or \u201cnot until she\u2019s dead.\u201d And I held to that. Don\u2019t allow yourself to reopen old wounds, it\u2019s in no way worth it.", "NTA. I stopped spending holidays with my mom until I saw my brother's obituary.", "NTA. Your family already lied to you once saying your grandfather wouldn't be there, & then of course he showed up. And your father doesn't get to determine how *you* feel about anything that's happened; *you* are the only person who can decide if you have closure or not.", "NAH - kinda of tilting towards NTA - if more information is revealed then I could pass the AH judgement on your lying family members. \n\n\nit's difficult for others to understand how traumatizing someone was until they walk a mile in the shoes you wore.  \n\nYes, your family doesn't understand and desires for everyone to be humble and welcoming.\n\nBut you are not ready and should not be forced to include anyone who you feel harmed you in your life or the lives of your children.  \n\nI don't know the whole story. \n\nWhat leaves a bad taste in my mouth is the fact they lied to you in the past.  \n\nI understand that sometimes people don't get the emotional scares other leave on us.  But if they think that lying to you will open the heavens and a angel of mercy will descend from the heavens to cleanse everyone's hearts of pain.....\n\nDoubtful.....\n\nWhy the NAH? Everyone has expectations.  They form those expectations based on there understanding and try to impose there will onto others based on these expectations.  \n\nI am giving people the benefit of the doubt.  \n\nIt's similar to white lies people tell to avoid conflict.  Like the lies that a fitness fanatic tells a morbidly obese person about there appearance and trying not to disrespect or hurt thier obese person.  \nYes, there are ways to say things in a respectful and productive manner.  However, nothing feels better then total one of the extremes.  Those are to tell a blatant lie or the absolute truth.  \n\nSo naturally they lie to you about grandfather with the expectations that it's \"fine.\"\nWhich now has created a situation. They choose the lie. You choose to just tell the truth; where you expect a certified copy of your grandfather death certificate.  \n\nThe solution is for each side to develop an understanding and respect for boundaries.\n\nEdit: grammar and clarification.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou don't want to see your grandfather,  \nwhich is your prerogative, and which your family should also respect.  \n\n\nSince the trust is broken already, there is no problem is being rude by asking his death certificate.  \n\n\nPS  \n\n\nThey can also fake death certificates.  \nSo it is better to get a proof in the format of a obituary picture published in a newspaper and trying to verify if that has been actually published.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Understand that this is your grandpa. An Old man.\nNow, you have a husband and kids. You shouldn't be holding deep grudges on people who might die any day. After all, you grew up in their presence. He would have wanted to see you grow into a mature, confident woman, with a family of your own .\n\nBesides, he didn't even abuse you, but your grandmother. Of course that is not right, you may be angry at them, but not even when he is ill.\nHave you considered talking it out??\nDo you think your grandma would be happy to know that you spoke that way??\nThey were old when you were 16...did you think he was going to be younger as you grew older??? \nEven in that reception, he probably wanted to meet you, see you grow up and asked for apology, so that he could be at peace, but you didn't give him that opportunity \nOnce escaping from your family is not mature enough, but Wishing straight DEATH to a very ILL, OLD man, who raised you, who might be bad, is straight up RUDE, IMMATURE AND HORRID.\n\nYTA...Big and Bold", "YTA- Stop adding extra drama and just opt out of family gatherings if you really can't stand to see the dude.", "I am from a place where morals and customs are really important.

Not sure where you're getting any of this, it kind of reeks as projection. \n\nAlso, I think it perfectly valid to not want anything to do with him even it he was just abusing her grandma.\n\nGrowing older does not absolve you of the wrongdoing you have committed.

I don\u2019t talk to my father and would be totally fine if he died. He was abusive and made my life hell.  He is toxic as is this grandpa.
