Maybe it\u2019s because those are quieter songs and everyone else was relaxing a bit. Not these girls. I finally leaned over and said could you please try not to scream, it\u2019s really hard to hear Taylor. One of the girls looked mortified, one of them said sure no problem, and the third girl gave me the stink eye. They were quiet for the rest of folklore, but at 1989 when the music picks up the stink eye girl resumed her banshee screams, the second girl was loud but not obnoxious, and the first girl barely seemed to be singing at all. \n\nOn the drive home, my sister said I can\u2019t believe you told those girls to shut up.

Those tickets are hella expensive.  You\u2019re there to hear Taylor.  Not strangers shrieking.\n\nETA singing along and occasional cheering is one thing.  Shrieking the entire time for attention is another.  It\u2019s not cool to ruin everyone else\u2019s time for your TikTok", "NTA.  Having fun and being vocal is one thing, intentionally screaming while making TikTok videos for views and likes is something entirely different altogether.", "NTA you didn't pay an extortionate amount of money to listen to banshees scream and wail.\n\nI regularly go to indoor and outdoor gigs and yes, you do expect background crowd noise.\n\nBut what you experienced is beyond acceptable.", "NTA. I also get irritated when I\u2019m around people doing this at concerts. I understand you paid for a ticket too and want to enjoy the show how you want, but when your behavior is affecting the way the people around you are enjoying the show, that\u2019s where you have to draw a line. Incredibly immature especially considering you guesstimated their age to be in their 20s. This sounds like a case of 3 young women who have an unhealthy parasocial relationship with a celebrity. People do this crap at concerts in hopes of getting noticed and for what? So your favorite artist makes eye contact with you once or twice and then never thinks about you again? Insanity in the highest degree.", "nta i would have been meaner then you if someone did that to me but i am an asshole", "NTA - I went to cirque du soleil once and paid good money for close seats. There was a family next to me, parents, toddler, and baby, the baby started screaming when the show started. After about 20 min of just pure screaming I leaned over and asked if they could take the baby out until it calmed down as there were people all around who couldn\u2019t enjoy the show. One parent went out and never came back. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to endure screaming for a short while, but at some point it becomes a hinderance on everyone\u2019s enjoyment. It\u2019s ok to say something", "Totally NTA. And a little historical context; the \u2018incessant screaming\u2019 played a part in the Beatles no longer touring. \n\nGranted tech is better now, so it\u2019s unlikely to prevent the performers from hearing each other like then, but it\u2019s still obnoxious.

Why go to a concert if you can\u2019t even hear the singer.", "I personally feel that everyone should be respectful of everyone else\u2019s enjoyment at a concert. This means that those who prefer less audience noise need to recognize that people are going to be loud at concerts, but it also means that there is a limit to that volume, because everyone is there and paid to see the performance, not listen to audience members. \n\nI asked someone not to do their incredibly loud whistle at a party with live music once. It was ear shattering like actually physically painful, and right in the middle of a whole lot of people. I think I was doing everyone a favor in that case, but maybe I was the a hole. Either way, I wanted to enjoy the music, not be made deaf by someone who just wanted to whistle loudly. She was cool about it, and I did apologize as I was asking. Mutual respect is the idea, so hopefully everyone has fun no matter how much or how little they are contributing to the volume.", "NTA Assuming this took place like you said, it is not unreasonable to be expected to hear a concert that you no doubt paid good money for. I have been to concerts and I totally get when a song you love opens cheering, but the reason you go is to see an artist you like and hear the music that brought you there. \n\nSome people need to look around and realize that everyone else that is there paid to be there as well. If they wanted TSwift to recognize them, there are front row tickets, backstage passes, and such available.", "NTA. That\u2019s super annoying for everyone there whoa wants to hear the artist, not a bunch of random girls. And they are stupid to think they could be heard from stage over all the rest of the noise.", "Nahhhhh You're Not The Asshole. You also paid for those tickets I would assume, you also deserve to have a good time and not have it ruined by someone being obnoxious. And like yea, concerts are loud, but comon' there's loud, and then there's screaming like you're an omen of death in the family. (You said banshee, so :P )", "NTA for telling them to stop screaming, but I was at that show and it was really hard for anyone to hear Taylor \u2013 she was singing along with her fans, not the other way around.", "So NTA. I do not hesitate to tell people to shut up at concerts when they are being loud and obnoxious.\n\nI even got a cheer from the crowd around me at a festival for doing it.\n\nI hate people that talk loudly all the way through a band more than anything else in the world.", "Reminds me of this https://vm.tiktok.com/ZM21reLF3/    \nBut in all seriousness NTA, one thing is to scream of excitement, another is to try to get the singers attention.", "NTA\n\nThe correct petty response would have been an attempt to mirror scream/shriek with them. Starting right as they start and ending right as they end... Though you would absolutely be on their level.", "NTA. They were obnoxious & I\u2019m willing to bet the people around you were grateful you asked them.", "LOL this was literally me at my first concert: New Kids in the Block \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nCouldn\u2019t hear anything because of all the screaming. \n\nNTA", "NTA, if it was little kids I would say cut them some slack but grown ass adults should know when they\u2019re disrupting other people\u2019s enjoyment of a concert.

It's like the 5th one I have seen in the past week. Maybe Taylor Swift is the real AH.", "NTA I\u2019m also a Swiftie and I don\u2019t love this about our fandom, let\u2019s sing along sure, but I\u2019ve heard the scream-singing you\u2019ve described (thankfully only in videos) but let\u2019s not detract from everyone else\u2019s experiences. I was at night 3 and thankfully no one did that!", "So you're NTA for asking them to stop, it was a simple request and they abided by it until 1989 came on. But I will say that I think you need re-evaluate your expectations of how people are supposed to behave at these concerts. This is exactly how I would expect someone at a Taylor concert to act. Like nothing they were doing was weird or out of the norm", "That's just the way she sings", "[deleted]", "INFO: Were they screaming between songs, or over the lyrics? How do you know they were purposely being loud to annoy people, and that they weren't just excited to be at the show?\n\nI like to enjoy concerts and feel like there's this unspoken etiquette about when/how loud you should be screaming at various points. I get annoyed when I can't hear the artist I paid to see because other people are screaming over the lyrics. But if they're screaming during the non-singing portions of songs or the concert, I don't think it's a big deal. \n\nI think I'd also be annoyed if I paid to see an artist and was told by someone else not to scream at an outdoor venue during a concert for (arguably) the biggest artist of our time. It's not like it's a low-key acoustic tour by John Mayer, it's a sold out stadium concert by *Taylor Swift*.

The Beatles stopped performing live because of exactly this issue- their fans were screaming so loud that no-one could hear any of the music. Taylor Swift knows who her fans are, and how they behave at her concerts. This was the experience she wanted you to have, the experience she was happy to take your money for.\n\nThe fact is, if you saw the Beatles live, and could actually hear them playing anything, you didn't have the real experience of seeing them live, which was just having your eardrums ruptured by screaming teenage girls \n\nYou are NTA, but i'm not suprised your sister mentioned it to you.

I'm there to see the artist and enjoy the show.
