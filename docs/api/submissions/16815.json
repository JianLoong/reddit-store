This was not normal singing/screaming along. These girls were purposefully being as loud as they possibly could be in hopes of getting Taylor\u2019s attention. I know for a fact they were aware of how obnoxious they were because they were making TikToks and literally said \u201cwe are gonna be the loudest bitches on Nashville night 2\u201d and every time Taylor looked in the general area of our section they flipped out, genuinely convinced that she heard them. \n\nI thought for sure they\u2019d lose their voices or quiet down, but were somehow even LOUDER during the folklore set (halfway through the show). Maybe it\u2019s because those are quieter songs and everyone else was relaxing a bit. Not these girls. I finally leaned over and said could you please try not to scream, it\u2019s really hard to hear Taylor. One of the girls looked mortified, one of them said sure no problem, and the third girl gave me the stink eye. They were quiet for the rest of folklore, but at 1989 when the music picks up the stink eye girl resumed her banshee screams, the second girl was loud but not obnoxious, and the first girl barely seemed to be singing at all. \n\nOn the drive home, my sister said I can\u2019t believe you told those girls to shut up.

Those tickets are hella expensive.  You\u2019re there to hear Taylor.  Not strangers shrieking.\n\nETA singing along and occasional cheering is one thing.  Shrieking the entire time for attention is another.  It\u2019s not cool to ruin everyone else\u2019s time for your TikTok", "NTA.  Having fun and being vocal is one thing, intentionally screaming while making TikTok videos for views and likes is something entirely different altogether.", "NTA you didn't pay an extortionate amount of money to listen to banshees scream and wail.\n\nI regularly go to indoor and outdoor gigs and yes, you do expect background crowd noise.\n\nBut what you experienced is beyond acceptable.", "NTA. I also get irritated when I\u2019m around people doing this at concerts. I understand you paid for a ticket too and want to enjoy the show how you want, but when your behavior is affecting the way the people around you are enjoying the show, that\u2019s where you have to draw a line. Incredibly immature especially considering you guesstimated their age to be in their 20s. This sounds like a case of 3 young women who have an unhealthy parasocial relationship with a celebrity. People do this crap at concerts in hopes of getting noticed and for what? So your favorite artist makes eye contact with you once or twice and then never thinks about you again? Insanity in the highest degree.", "nta i would have been meaner then you if someone did that to me but i am an asshole", "NTA - I went to cirque du soleil once and paid good money for close seats. There was a family next to me, parents, toddler, and baby, the baby started screaming when the show started. After about 20 min of just pure screaming I leaned over and asked if they could take the baby out until it calmed down as there were people all around who couldn\u2019t enjoy the show. One parent went out and never came back. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to endure screaming for a short while, but at some point it becomes a hinderance on everyone\u2019s enjoyment. It\u2019s ok to say something", "Totally NTA. And a little historical context; the \u2018incessant screaming\u2019 played a part in the Beatles no longer touring. \n\nGranted tech is better now, so it\u2019s unlikely to prevent the performers from hearing each other like then, but it\u2019s still obnoxious. And I would still bet if Taylor noticed she probably wasn\u2019t appreciative.\n\nhttps://medium.com/the-beatles-faq/why-did-the-beatles-stop-performing-live-ca3c0583ce4f", "NTA, not sure if some of these other commenters have ever been to a concert, but you still have to read the room like any other adult, and not scream your faces off during quiet moments of the show.", "NTA. Why go to a concert if you can\u2019t even hear the singer.", "I personally feel that everyone should be respectful of everyone else\u2019s enjoyment at a concert. This means that those who prefer less audience noise need to recognize that people are going to be loud at concerts, but it also means that there is a limit to that volume, because everyone is there and paid to see the performance, not listen to audience members. \n\nI asked someone not to do their incredibly loud whistle at a party with live music once. It was ear shattering like actually physically painful, and right in the middle of a whole lot of people. I think I was doing everyone a favor in that case, but maybe I was the a hole. Either way, I wanted to enjoy the music, not be made deaf by someone who just wanted to whistle loudly. She was cool about it, and I did apologize as I was asking. Mutual respect is the idea, so hopefully everyone has fun no matter how much or how little they are contributing to the volume.", "NTA Assuming this took place like you said, it is not unreasonable to be expected to hear a concert that you no doubt paid good money for. I have been to concerts and I totally get when a song you love opens cheering, but the reason you go is to see an artist you like and hear the music that brought you there. \n\nSome people need to look around and realize that everyone else that is there paid to be there as well. If they wanted TSwift to recognize them, there are front row tickets, backstage passes, and such available.", "NTA. That\u2019s super annoying for everyone there whoa wants to hear the artist, not a bunch of random girls. And they are stupid to think they could be heard from stage over all the rest of the noise.", "Nahhhhh You're Not The Asshole. You also paid for those tickets I would assume, you also deserve to have a good time and not have it ruined by someone being obnoxious. And like yea, concerts are loud, but comon' there's loud, and then there's screaming like you're an omen of death in the family. (You said banshee, so :P )", "NTA for telling them to stop screaming, but I was at that show and it was really hard for anyone to hear Taylor \u2013 she was singing along with her fans, not the other way around.", "So NTA. I do not hesitate to tell people to shut up at concerts when they are being loud and obnoxious.\n\nI even got a cheer from the crowd around me at a festival for doing it.\n\nI hate people that talk loudly all the way through a band more than anything else in the world.", "Reminds me of this https://vm.tiktok.com/ZM21reLF3/    \nBut in all seriousness NTA, one thing is to scream of excitement, another is to try to get the singers attention.", "NTA\n\nThe correct petty response would have been an attempt to mirror scream/shriek with them. Starting right as they start and ending right as they end... Though you would absolutely be on their level.", "NTA. They were obnoxious & I\u2019m willing to bet the people around you were grateful you asked them.", "LOL this was literally me at my first concert: New Kids in the Block \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nCouldn\u2019t hear anything because of all the screaming. \n\nNTA", "NTA, if it was little kids I would say cut them some slack but grown ass adults should know when they\u2019re disrupting other people\u2019s enjoyment of a concert. Also screaming during the Folklore set makes zero sense and would totally kill the vibe. \u201c\ud83c\udfb6but it would\u2019ve been fun if you would\u2019ve been the one\ud83c\udfb6 *shrill scream bloody murder*\u201d? - no thank you", "WTH is up with all these AITA posts caused by Taylor Swift concerts? It's like the 5th one I have seen in the past week. Maybe Taylor Swift is the real AH.", "NTA I\u2019m also a Swiftie and I don\u2019t love this about our fandom, let\u2019s sing along sure, but I\u2019ve heard the scream-singing you\u2019ve described (thankfully only in videos) but let\u2019s not detract from everyone else\u2019s experiences. I was at night 3 and thankfully no one did that!", "So you're NTA for asking them to stop, it was a simple request and they abided by it until 1989 came on. But I will say that I think you need re-evaluate your expectations of how people are supposed to behave at these concerts. This is exactly how I would expect someone at a Taylor concert to act. Like nothing they were doing was weird or out of the norm", "That's just the way she sings", "**YTA** for asking peopld to quiet down at a concert. That's the one place you can literally be as loud as you want. Hell, I usually have to yell at the top of my lungs in the ear of the person I'm sitting next to just to communicate with them.", "INFO: Were they screaming between songs, or over the lyrics? How do you know they were purposely being loud to annoy people?\n\nI'm on the fence here, because I like to enjoy concerts and feel like there's this unspoken etiquette about when/how loud you should be screaming at various points. I get annoyed when I can't hear the artist I paid to see. But I think I'd also be annoyed if I paid to see an artist and was told by someone else not to scream at an outdoor venue during a concert for (arguably) the biggest artist of our time. I feel like this kind of behavior is not really off the wall for a Taylor Swift concert, even if it's annoying.", "YTA, let the woo girls have their moment!", "YTA, it's an outdoor concert. bring earplugs if you're bothered by screaming.", "YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Spent $200 for a ticket once and the drunk guy next to me screamed every lyric the entire show. Thanks, my fellow fan, but I didn't pay to hear you sing these songs.

I would have told them to STFU.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t pay good money to listen to banshees shrieking", "NTA I don't like live performances just because of the  people who think it's appropriate to scream. Why pay money to not even hear the show?

Like damn. This is something I\u2019m worried about when I go to the concert this summer is some feral child (because let\u2019s get real, people who act like this are children) will be screeching near me. Like I get that said feral child paid for their ticket to be there, but so did the rest of us and we came to hear Taylor.", "NTA. I have watched a bunch of live streams of the tour over the past few months, and you have the people who just listen, the people who sing normally, the people who scream lyrics, and the people who scream like they are being murdered.  \n\nI am good with the first three, but the last one is just rude. I know everyone paid good money to be there, but you need to be considerate of your neighbors.", "NTA\n\nYou pay good money for something and want to enjoy it, if someone is being OTT then asking them to put a zip on it a little isn't a problem.\n\nI had to do similar at a cinema once, couple sat next to us despite it being nearly empty. he sat next to me and was about 30 stone, she was constantly checking her phone and after 30 mins I leant over and said \"can you stop effing doing that it's ruining it!\"  She didn't check her phone for the rest of the night and at the end, the couple behind thanked me for saying something.", "At that point, make a tiktok of the screaming banshees while they're making their tiktok?", "Oh wow, if that\u2019s normal behaviour at a concert then I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t go to many. Why would you constantly scream and make a tit of yourself instead of enjoying the songs and cheering at the start/end of each one?", "this is definitely not following normal concert etiquette .", "While if it truly was a banshee scream definitely not the asshole. But if it\u2019s more so yelling, I define a yell as a quieter scream, I\u2019d say asshole. I have seen Taylor Swift 5 times in the past and am going to this tour soon too and my friends and I all yell and sing along the entire time. We had a group behind us at the last tour ask if we could sit but we said no because we were there to jump and dance around within our space.", "I\u2019ve been to 2 other TS concerts (1989 & Reputation \u2014 along with hundreds of other concerts throughout my life) and this is just not correct. Maybe people on the PNW have more damn sense to them to not act a fool.\n\nETA: singing along to the songs, cheering, and whatnot are typical but what OP is describing is not that.", "There\u2019s a difference between enjoying oneself singing along and shrieking for attention.  One\u2019s acceptable behavior at a concert, the other is obnoxious and subtracts from everyone around yous enjoyment.", "I...disagree. Yeah you should be loud, but like read the room too. If she's singing a ballad or it's a quiet moment, don't just scream your face off.", "Cheering during a song is fine, they were screaming the entire first half. No one bought tickets to listen to them scream.", "Confused - why go to a concert not to listen?", "Influencers in the wild content for sure", "I went to many concerts and this has never happened to me. People might sing along and cheer between every song but not the way OP described it. Not even at festivals.", "Not a regular concert a Taylor concert is what I meant. This is regular behaviour for a Taylor concert", "Have you been to a concert and seen what happens when the lead performer looks at or approaches your general direction?", "admittedly, i was talking about a specific kind of earplugs that filter out outside noise and focus on the music. i wore some at my ts concert and they helped tremendously. there was just so. much. screaming.", "Just because it is a regular thing for Taylor Swift concerts doesn't make it okay. This is terrible behavior to have. No matter who is performing.", "Gosh, I\u2019m glad I\u2019m old haha!", "Yeah there\u2019s a few cheers and then there\u2019s obnoxious shrieking for an entire concert to make a TikTok.   Very different dynamics", "Every concert has different etiquette. Not all venues, performers, events have the same vibe. You wouldn\u2019t mosh at Phoebe Bridgers concert for example but it\u2019s perfectly normal behaviour for say a metal show. Now I think moshing is dangerous and I don\u2019t like it but it\u2019s totally normal behaviour for certain concerts and I wouldn\u2019t say anyone is doing anything wrong by participating. \n\nIf you\u2019re going to a Taylor concert you can totally expect screaming and yelling, it\u2019s just to be expected and sorry but most swifties going to the show are aware of that", "You're missing the point. Moshing doesn't stop you from HEARING the performer. Screaming and being obnoxious to the point where others around you can't hear the performer is so selfish. You aren't the only one there. There are others around you that paid money to see her. There is absolutely ZERO need to scream at the top of your lungs for an entire show."]}
