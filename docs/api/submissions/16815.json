Maybe it\u2019s because those are quieter songs and everyone else was relaxing a bit. Not these girls. I finally leaned over and said could you please try not to scream, it\u2019s really hard to hear Taylor. One of the girls looked mortified, one of them said sure no problem, and the third girl gave me the stink eye. They were quiet for the rest of folklore, but at 1989 when the music picks up the stink eye girl resumed her banshee screams, the second girl was loud but not obnoxious, and the first girl barely seemed to be singing at all. \n\nOn the drive home, my sister said I can\u2019t believe you told those girls to shut up.

Those tickets are hella expensive.  You\u2019re there to hear Taylor.  Not strangers shrieking.\n\nETA singing along and occasional cheering is one thing.  Shrieking the entire time for attention is another.  It\u2019s not cool to ruin everyone else\u2019s time for your TikTok", "NTA.  Having fun and being vocal is one thing, intentionally screaming while making TikTok videos for views and likes is something entirely different altogether.", "NTA you didn't pay an extortionate amount of money to listen to banshees scream and wail.\n\nI regularly go to indoor and outdoor gigs and yes, you do expect background crowd noise.\n\nBut what you experienced is beyond acceptable.", "NTA. I also get irritated when I\u2019m around people doing this at concerts. I understand you paid for a ticket too and want to enjoy the show how you want, but when your behavior is affecting the way the people around you are enjoying the show, that\u2019s where you have to draw a line. Incredibly immature especially considering you guesstimated their age to be in their 20s. This sounds like a case of 3 young women who have an unhealthy parasocial relationship with a celebrity. People do this crap at concerts in hopes of getting noticed and for what? So your favorite artist makes eye contact with you once or twice and then never thinks about you again? Insanity in the highest degree.", "nta i would have been meaner then you if someone did that to me but i am an asshole", "NTA - I went to cirque du soleil once and paid good money for close seats. There was a family next to me, parents, toddler, and baby, the baby started screaming when the show started. After about 20 min of just pure screaming I leaned over and asked if they could take the baby out until it calmed down as there were people all around who couldn\u2019t enjoy the show. One parent went out and never came back. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to endure screaming for a short while, but at some point it becomes a hinderance on everyone\u2019s enjoyment. It\u2019s ok to say something", "Totally NTA. And a little historical context; the \u2018incessant screaming\u2019 played a part in the Beatles no longer touring. \n\nGranted tech is better now, so it\u2019s unlikely to prevent the performers from hearing each other like then, but it\u2019s still obnoxious.

Why go to a concert if you can\u2019t even hear the singer.", "I personally feel that everyone should be respectful of everyone else\u2019s enjoyment at a concert. This means that those who prefer less audience noise need to recognize that people are going to be loud at concerts, but it also means that there is a limit to that volume, because everyone is there and paid to see the performance, not listen to audience members. \n\nI asked someone not to do their incredibly loud whistle at a party with live music once. It was ear shattering like actually physically painful, and right in the middle of a whole lot of people. I think I was doing everyone a favor in that case, but maybe I was the a hole. Either way, I wanted to enjoy the music, not be made deaf by someone who just wanted to whistle loudly. She was cool about it, and I did apologize as I was asking. Mutual respect is the idea, so hopefully everyone has fun no matter how much or how little they are contributing to the volume.", "NTA Assuming this took place like you said, it is not unreasonable to be expected to hear a concert that you no doubt paid good money for. I have been to concerts and I totally get when a song you love opens cheering, but the reason you go is to see an artist you like and hear the music that brought you there. \n\nSome people need to look around and realize that everyone else that is there paid to be there as well. If they wanted TSwift to recognize them, there are front row tickets, backstage passes, and such available.", "NTA. That\u2019s super annoying for everyone there whoa wants to hear the artist, not a bunch of random girls. And they are stupid to think they could be heard from stage over all the rest of the noise.", "Nahhhhh You're Not The Asshole. You also paid for those tickets I would assume, you also deserve to have a good time and not have it ruined by someone being obnoxious. And like yea, concerts are loud, but comon' there's loud, and then there's screaming like you're an omen of death in the family. (You said banshee, so :P )", "NTA for telling them to stop screaming, but I was at that show and it was really hard for anyone to hear Taylor \u2013 she was singing along with her fans, not the other way around.", "So NTA. I do not hesitate to tell people to shut up at concerts when they are being loud and obnoxious.\n\nI even got a cheer from the crowd around me at a festival for doing it.\n\nI hate people that talk loudly all the way through a band more than anything else in the world.", "Reminds me of this https://vm.tiktok.com/ZM21reLF3/    \nBut in all seriousness NTA, one thing is to scream of excitement, another is to try to get the singers attention.", "NTA\n\nThe correct petty response would have been an attempt to mirror scream/shriek with them. Starting right as they start and ending right as they end... Though you would absolutely be on their level.", "NTA.

It's like the 5th one I have seen in the past week. Maybe Taylor Swift is the real AH.", "NTA I\u2019m also a Swiftie and I don\u2019t love this about our fandom, let\u2019s sing along sure, but I\u2019ve heard the scream-singing you\u2019ve described (thankfully only in videos) but let\u2019s not detract from everyone else\u2019s experiences. I was at night 3 and thankfully no one did that!", "So you're NTA for asking them to stop, it was a simple request and they abided by it until 1989 came on. But I will say that I think you need re-evaluate your expectations of how people are supposed to behave at these concerts. This is exactly how I would expect someone at a Taylor concert to act. Like nothing they were doing was weird or out of the norm", "That's just the way she sings", "[deleted]", "INFO: Were they screaming between songs, or over the lyrics? How do you know they were purposely being loud to annoy people, and that they weren't just excited to be at the show?\n\nI like to enjoy concerts and feel like there's this unspoken etiquette about when/how loud you should be screaming at various points. I get annoyed when I can't hear the artist I paid to see because other people are screaming over the lyrics. But if they're screaming during the non-singing portions of songs or the concert, I don't think it's a big deal. \n\nI think I'd also be annoyed if I paid to see an artist and was told by someone else not to scream at an outdoor venue during a concert for (arguably) the biggest artist of our time. It's not like it's a low-key acoustic tour by John Mayer, it's a sold out stadium concert by *Taylor Swift*.

The Beatles stopped performing live because of exactly this issue- their fans were screaming so loud that no-one could hear any of the music. Taylor Swift knows who her fans are, and how they behave at her concerts.

NTA, especially because you mentioned they were doing TikToks! Yeah, fuck that! I was just recently at a Depeche Mode concert and Dave Gahn (lead singer) told someone in the audience from the stage, \"Put down your fucking phone and enjoy the show!\" God only knows how many phones were pointed at him, but still, I could not agree more. I'm there to see the artist and enjoy the show. That's what you paid for, and the last thing you expected or wanted was some side show with rando wannabe influencers acting like idiots for the sake of views. It's an unnecessary distraction and you did the right thing!", "Yes. Yta. Dont go to places people scream", "U know what, Devil\u2019s advocate here, ESH. It\u2019s a Taylor swift concert, so I expect teenagers to be constantly screaming. Unfortunately that\u2019s just how it is. I went to a Billie Eilish concert (I\u2019m a 22 year old male) last year in the pit and everyone around me were constantly screaming. It was annoying but I had to remember her audience is mainly in the 12-18 girls range. Same to Taylor. Now I just bring earplugs. They\u2019re here to have a great time just like you, and they might of spent hundreds on their ticket, of course they\u2019re gonna go crazy and constantly scream. It\u2019s annoying for the girls to scream every 5 seconds though, it\u2019s just extra for no reason.\n\nTaylor swift is the real asshole tbf, I\u2019ve seen her name here way too many times this week.", "NTA. There's a difference between cheering and singing along and just shrieking to try and get attention. TS tickets are HELLA expensive and I'm sure hard to get. You have the right to be able to HEAR ther person you paid to see. People like that ruin shows for everyone else.", "No shoot the muppets", "NTA- I would be so annoyed, you do have a lot of patience", "NTA. Anyone who talks/screams/makes stupid noise during a music concert is the A. I have told countless people, mostly grown adults to shut up during concerts. A lot of time it\u2019s because they\u2019re on cocaine. I start with a polite ask, as we have all been guilty of it before, but if I have to ask a second time it\u2019s coming out laced with profanity. I didn\u2019t pay money to listen to you yammer on all night. Go stand in the back if you want to talk.", "NTA\n\nI keep seeing TikToks of these kids shrieking and I'm no longer sad that I wasn't able to get tickets", "NTA. If you give me their names, I will find them and tell them to shut the fuck up too.", "NTA \n\nScream, sing along, but don\u2019t drown out the main act.", "NTA. I despise people who scream over music at concerts. It's one thing to react to a solo or something stand-out, but to just constantly scream is obnoxious as hell and deeply disrespectful of everyone around them, and the artist. This shit is literally why The Beatles stopped touring \n\nFrankly, you showed incredible restraint waiting as long as you did and being as polite as you were. Not sure I could've done the same.", "Yup, I went to a gig a few months ago and was barrier and the lassie behind me was kicking me every other second to the point I had bruises because \u201cshe had to show she got barrier on TikTok\u201d \ud83e\udd2c\n\nAlthough she did get kicked out once a security guard figured out what she was doing which was highly amusing for me", "NTA, I would have said way worse. This has somehow been a debate lately, with younger folks saying \"I paid for my tickets, I'll enjoy them however I want.\" Sorry, but that's not how this works. You don't get to ruin other people's fun by being a loud little brat, everyone else also paid for tickets.\n\nI swear to god since covid people don't know how to act in public any more. I can't go to a movie without having to shush people, and then they get super defensive when you do it.", "[deleted]", "I hate nothing more than when someone (usually a kid - regardless of gender) sees a celebrity, or gets told to get loud/make noise at a concert or a sporting event or anything like that... and they choose to literally shriek. Like they're being murdered. Like, shrill screams. \n\nThat's what I imagine with this post. And there wasn't even a get loud prompt that can \"justify\" it.", "My mother grew up in Queens, a few miles from Shea (what is now CitiField) and she said they absolutely heard the screaming all the way at their house.", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/beatlemaniacs-beliebers-directioners--why-do-they-scream/2014/07/24/ae5437b4-1273-11e4-9285-4243a40ddc97_story.html", "My stadium already sucks for concerts.

Yeah, sing along, it's a concert. But the amount of \"I paid for my tickets too so I should get to be as shrill as I want\" is ridiculous.

I think when OP says screaming, you are imagining like \"wooo I love taylor! woooo! omg! AAAAAAH!\" instead of the actual noise these girls were making which is just a high-pitched banshee scream that can burst eardrums and drowns any and all other noises.", "Why should the burden be on the people trying to enjoy the concert to block out unnecessary screaming and not on the people screaming like banshees to shut their traps?", "But now people will press charges. Back in the day you\u2019d punch someone and that was the end of it. Now you\u2019ll end up tased and in jail.", "Ew.  These types of people infuriate me.

What you\u2019re describing is a fan club meet up.  Not a concert where tickets cost hundreds of dollars.", "There's 100% a difference between singing along and doing what OP is mentioning, though. I've been to hundreds of shows in my life, and probably sang along at 80% of them but not to the point of other people in the crowd's detriment! I personally go to shows for both things, but for a lot of artists I want to hear them, too. Especially for TS prices.", "Thanks for not actually having an expressed opinion of your own and responding to the thread like a normal rational human being, but instead spamming multiple people with a paywalled article. \n\nBtw, the article you spammed does not even fully relate the situation the OP described. First, they are not adolescents. Secondly, they are not doing this during the socialized parts of the song where people would naturally be screaming. Third, they were trying to make tiktoks and trying to get views, rather than involuntarily actively engaging.", "Stop sharing a pay-walled article. No one is going to click, and you added zero dialogue.", "It\u2019s INSANE!\n\nI mean, I get it! She\u2019s amazing! it\u2019s a thrilling show! Her bridges are CATCHY AF!!!! \n\nBUT\u2026 I imagine that if you\u2019re paying that much to see and hear Taylor you\u2019d actually WANT to hear HER, not just the echo of your own shrieking in your head. \n\nI\u2019ve also seen some people come across my FYP who needed to see ENTs bc they absolutely shredded their vocal cords shrieking during a TS show.

I don't know if I believe they were banshee screaming for 100% of the show, and that she kindly asked them to stop. Her sister was surprised at her for asking them to stop, which makes me wonder if they were really as obnoxious as OP claims and if OP was actually as polite as she thinks she was. \n\nI feel like if they were bansheeing the whole time, OP's sister wouldn't have remarked on her telling them to stop screaming.", "And may she always step in a puddle whenever she wears socks.", "I like your ill wishes. :)", "Right at the front of a standing crowd literally getting pushed against the barriers", "Ignore them.
