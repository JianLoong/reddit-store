We are calling the doctor tomorrow to schedule an appointment for sure and I put a towel down after I asked and put my pillow to sleep there and then she threw it back over the other side.

If it \"wasn't a big deal\" why are you making her sleep in the wet spot? Put a towel down.", "Oh god OP, YTA without a doubt in my mind. She\u2019s a mother of your child, she just delivered a baby 5 weeks ago and she now has complications that caused her to bleed excessively. You went from being supportive and reassuring to AH because of a blood stain that she already felt extremely guilty and insecure for? Again, after delivering your child at that? Sheets were washed even\u2026 after she put her body through so much stress for again, your child, and probably is extremely worried about what happened and feels embarrassed\u2026 you do what? Ask her to switch sides because you can\u2019t handle a little damp sheet with a stain after it was washed? And you call it \u201cpost pregnancy blood\u201d? It\u2019s such a tiny inconvenience to pay for a mother of your first child. Support her, don\u2019t be an ass.", "YTA - you don't want to sleep in the wet patch but you expect her to?? She's still recovering from major surgery, you can put up with the damp patch.", "YTA fucking suck it up bro, she was pregnant for 9 months with your child, then they cut a giant hole in her to pull the baby out. Put a towel down or get a mattress cover. You're going to spend the next year covered in bodily fluids anyhow.", "YTA. It's not normal to start bleeding that much again after 5 weeks. When it happened to me my doctor told me to go to the ER for an urgent ultrasound. And here you are worrying about something that could be solved by putting down a freaking towel.\n\nYou're in for a lot of tough life lessons in the next 18 years, son.", "YTA and you need to suck it up. You won't die from being uncomfortable or inconvenienced but she jolly well could be sick from her MAJOR surgery. What an ass.", "YTA but that doesn\u2019t matter. You need to get her to a hospital now!", "YTA. You prioritises yourself over your girlfriend. Why should she have to sleep in a damp patch?", "I'm worried, losing so much blood 5 weeks after giving birth is really not normat. You must caal a doctor now!!!! don't wait till tomorrow.  \nIn addition, YTA. She carried your child for 9 months, then had to undergo abdominal surgery to give birth to your child, she is still in the middle of the healing process. Lay down a towel and man up.", "YTA.", "YTA. She gave birth to your son. You could put up with mild discomfort after what she went through.", "I was going to say Y t a, but your come to Jesus moment has already happened. Hope your girlfriend is ok. I had 3 c-sections and I\u2019ve never soaked through a pad. Maybe you should call the after hours number to see if this is an ER situation.", "Yes YTA. She just gave birth, put her body through hell during 9 months, probably suffers a lot through the recovery, has to deal with the pain accompanying the blood, and you are afraid of a bit of a damp spot ? My god you are so egoistical. Mister shoudln't feel any bit of discomfort himself, but it's okay if it's on her. Let's give the recovering woman the damp spot because her fragile boyfriend can't take just a little bit of discomfort. So weak\n\nEdit: also op, you need to apologize, not do the solution that redditors gave you and think she will naturally feel so grateful for a solution you did not come up with. You need to apologize and listen to what she puts her body through. You need to acknowledge and recognize her discomfort (a weak word to speak about what she went through, in no way comparable to a damp spot) for over 9 months. You didn't resolve anything, she still is mad and probably resentful of you that you are so inconsiderate for her sacrifice and pain on top of being egoistical", "YTA. For one, you didn\u2019t clean enough if it\u2019s still wet. GROSS! For two, flip the mattress or spin it so it\u2019s in a less used spot. Lastly, if it wasn\u2019t a big deal and it\u2019s obviously not her fault AT ALL, why would you ask to swap spots to make your healing wife sleep on a wet bed that could, oh I don\u2019t know, be UNSANITARY for a healing wound that\u2019s massive? Clean up and be more considerate to her feelings and health", "YTA. She has enough to deal with and probably hasn't told you half of it because she can't articulate her worries and or doesn't want to worry you. Put a towel over the damp patch and get on with life.", "YTA", "Get a waterproof mattress pad.  They're like $25 at Walmart.", "Pregnancy takes a toll on the body physically and mentally even after birth. Put a towel down to absorb it and just sleep on it, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s uncomfortable for her as well on top of recovering. Also, sounds like she needs the ER, i had a c section and never bled like that.", "YTA without a doubt, but you could have been the hero if you had followed up your telling her that it was \"no big deal\" by acting like it and simply covering the wet spot with extra sheets or whatever and letting her sleep on the other side, because she DID have major surgery which she hasn't fully recovered from.", "YTA for making this up and it you are not she needs to leave your ass", "Dude. When you have a c-section you don't have post partum bleeding because they suction your uterus after the baby is born! The stuff thst you have to wait to bleed out with a vaginal birth is already taken care of! I had a c section and I never had more then spotting. If she soaked a pad and bleed enough to soak the bed you need to take her to the ER.", "Think you 22 yesr old fuck", "I had an emergency c-section and would have had no problem switching sides, but that's me.", "so i imagine you are sleeping on the side without the inconvenient stain for you? :/  YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your girlfriend is crazy hormonal right now. So you can easily hurt her feelings or tick her off. 2. Can't you get a waterproof mattress cover so it isn't still damp?

Why didn't you turn the mattress over?", "NAH. She's probably just starting her first post partum menstrual cycle, which is normal. At 5 weeks, she's also considered almost fully healed. And I would never make my husband lay in my blood spot post partum or not, and I also had a c-section. I mean, as a woman, these kinds of accidents happen, and she's got all the hormones going on, but the solution would have been new sheets with a towel underneath.", "NTA. If it's not a big deal then she should sleep in the mess she created. If it's just so easy as 'put a towel down' she should put a towel down and sleep on the wet bedsheet. 5 weeks is more than enough time to recover from childbirth. She needs to stop demanding special treatment only because she had a child. Thousands of women have children. It's ni big deal.", "Why is OP TA for not wanting to sleep in his gfs blood? That\u2019s disgusting. If anyone should sleep in it, it should be her since it\u2019s her blood\u2026", "NAH.  I totally get not wanting to sleep in a wet spot.  Like other said, put a towel down.  It is possible that this is her first period after and the first one can be crazy bad or it can be a complication.

Absolutely spot on.", "Couldn\u2019t agree more.", "I just can't believe how egoistical he is. Seriously i don't know if it's mysoginy, lack of education on pregnancy, or being totally inconsiderate and lack of empathy. I already feel bad for her because she felt so guilty (no wonder with op's reaction), but on top of that, he is ready to sacrifice her comfort for his comfort, while she just sacrificed her body for way more than 9 months. What a bad partner", "Put down a towel, flip the mattress, blow it dry with a hairdryer, get a dehumidifier, get a mattress topper. Idk, there are solutions here besides making the person who is post-op uncomfortable.", "Wait what? I bled for weeks\u2026 but then the whole birth was a disaster\u2026", "Why should the person who gave birth and had major surgery with obvious severe complications be put in a more uncomfortable position because OP didn\u2019t want to lay a towel down.
