I do sometimes struggle with admitting when I\u2019m wrong, so wanted to know if I should continue standing my ground (by stating that I didn\u2019t change my mind) or just agree and apologize to him to keep the peace. I really appreciate what he does for us, and 2 fries wasn\u2019t his focus/issue.

It impacts him no more than had a couple of fries fallen out of the bag in transport, you\u2019re still letting him keep the whole rest of the bag. That\u2019s NOT changing your mind. It\u2019s asking for a tiny bit of generosity in return. \n\nI bet when he realised how unreasonable he sounds after getting mad over sharing a fry, he back pedalled and made up some pretend reason to justify being mad.\n\nIt\u2019s weird to be be mad at you for not sharing his opinion on the definition of \u201cchanging your mind\u201d. You are your own person capable of forming your own opinions. You don\u2019t always have to agree with him, especially on small inconsequential matters. \n\nIt\u2019s a red flag that he isn\u2019t willing to share with his partner, that he has to make up reasons to be mad rather than admit he overreacted, and that he isn\u2019t  comfortable with you having your own opinion.

He & I watched TV until he decided to head home when I didn\u2019t offer to make him dinner.  I worked a physical & dirty job while he had an comfortable office job.

Sometimes when situations like this arise, I have a very hard time gauging when I\u2019m in the right or when I should check myself. He wanted me to admit that I changed my mind but I didn\u2019t agree with him that I did, as I merely told him that I wanted 2 fries, not that they weren\u2019t for him. He can be weird about his food, and he also really dislikes change. This spans over multiple facets of our lives, such as hating changes in routines, or other aspects of life.

You're probably gonna see a lot of passive aggressiveness from here on out.", "It's really not healthy that he wants you to \"admit fault\" over this, or for him to be so territorial about food in general. If you look at it this way, you happily gave him free fries but he wasn't happy about giving you just 2 (that he didn't even pay for!).The way he is pressuring you to admit to changing your mind or lying is very controlling and disrespectful. Most partners would have thought it was cute that you were \"stealing\" a couple fries. They might have playfully tried to defend them, or else tried to give you a couple more or offered to split them. It would have been friendly and light hearted. Not greedy and childish like his reaction was...\n\nI was in an abusive relationship when I was younger and your partner's attitude reminds me so much of my ex's before things got really bad. Stuff like this escalated until I felt more and more controlled. My ex had a similar fixation on everything needing to be a certain way, that he got his \"fair share\" and that somehow ended up being more and more at my expense. When we ordered fast food he would get so upset if I special ordered anything because he was convinced it increased the likelihood that his order would be accidentally altered too. At first it was just him being stressed out and making comments or expecting me to do extra work to make sure he got was he expected, but over the years it became days of silent treatment, not letting me sleep so he could try to get me to admit I was wrong, and eventually violence. \n\nYour relationship does not sound healthy. I know this was just one silly argument and it seems like the rest is fine, but his behavior is a huge red flag that he has the potential to become much worse. Abusive relationships happen very gradually, so that those in them don't recognize what's happening. Please be careful. Pay attention to how much energy you need to spend appeasing him,  because in a healthy relationship no one needs to do that at all. Your parents were abusive (as were mine) and unfortunately that can condition people to have a harder time recognizing abuse, and it makes abusive people seek them out.

He is upset about something else and using the fries and the accusation of changing your mind as an excuse to take it out on you. You deserve so much better than that. Stand your ground and try to have an adult conversation with him about why he\u2019s being like this over a couple of fries.
