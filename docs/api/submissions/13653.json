Happy Cake Day \n\nYour sister is an adult with kids. She needs to figure out how to do things on her own. Your mother has done her a great disservice", "It is pretty hypocritical of them!", "I can understand not wanting to accept a diabetes diagnosis. I was misdiagnosed as a Type 2 diabetic in 2015, and it was hard to change how I ate, how I bought food, accepting the diagnosis because I was young and didn't want to change.\n\nI did try to accept that I'm diabetic, but we found the meds weren't working at all well and there was no discussion and no education prescribed, so I just figured I'd diet and exercise and be good. \"Cured.\" Nope. 2019, I went into diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), nearly died, and that's when the misdiagnosis was discovered. I'm actually a Type 1 subset called \"Latent/late-onset Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA).\" I need insulin and always will. Nearly dying definitely kicked me in the butt about accepting my diagnosis and doing everything I can to change, and help educate others when I can.\n\nYour sister should get counseling, for learning to accept her diagnosis and for learning life skills in independence. It shouldn't be up to anyone but your sister to ensure she survives, and takes care of her children. It's not right nor ok for her children to see and learn their own mother isn't capable of being an adult/parent.\n\nNTA, OP. Do yourself the favor of leaving. You are NOT your sister's keeper."]}
