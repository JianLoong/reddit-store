No, they're not!", "NTA. I'm a little disappointed you missed the opportunity to say, \"are you and egoist for prioritizing you life over mine?\" \n\nAnyway, you're implementing boundaries and most people hate boundaries implemented from people they've been benefiting from. You're being exploited, of course they're angry that'll stop. What slave owner was excited when their slave ran away.", "NTA.  Tell your sister to grow up and be an adult.  There is no reason for her to rely on you the way she does.  She can\u2019t expect you to keep prioritizing her life over you.", "NTA. You are prioritizing your life over hers and that\u2019s completely reasonable. Move away and don\u2019t help for anything less than an emergency. Seriously get out of that situation.", "NTA. Put your foot down and make sure that the boundaries are clearly marked and respected.", "Info: any medical conditions, physical or mental, that contribute to your sister needing help?\n\nIf yes, gentle NTA. If no, hard NTA.\n\nThe important point is that you deserve to be able to live your own life, in your own way.", "You're right- you do have the right to your own life. Move away, don't look back, and live your very best life.\n\nNTA", "NTA, She should be independent at that age, you do not need to waste your life caring for her every need.", "NTA.\n\nWhy do they think their lives SHOULD be a priority over yours? That's messed up. And your mom has enabled your sister's behavior, and she's too old to change. What about the father(s) of the kid(s)?\n\nGo live!", "NTA. Your sister needs to prioritize her own life and especially her kids' lives. Get out while you can and stop enabling her behavior. She's never going to grow up at this rate.

Geesh", "You should be prioritizing your life over hers.  Everyone should.  How is your sister ever going to survive this life if she can't do things independently?

I almost said E S H because of how much you enabled her as well, but I think you were probably in a hard spot growing up being pressured to cater to her alongside your mom.\n\nYour sister is an adult with kids.

Your sister is almost 30 yrs old and needs to re-evaluate her self. And your mother needs to stop being an enabler. NTA. Get on with your life.", "NTA and yes you are prioritizing your life, that is what you should be doing. You are not doing your sister any favors by enabling her lack of responsibility. Live your life, if your mother wants to continue enabling your sister that is her problem, she is making that decision", "Being diabetic doesn't stop anyone from living/being in control of their life. She's the queen of enabled weaponised incompetence. Time for her to grow up & be an adult. Stop enabling her.", "NTA. Your mom is TA for raising your sister to be incompetent and expecting you to play along forever.\n\nI'd not have said emergency basis as they're likely to have emergencies all over the place.\n\nYour sister needs to step up and get her stuff taken care of. It was never realistic to expect you to be subservient to her needs forever.", "How dare you do exactly what your sister has been doing since childhood; prioritise yourself over others! /s\n\nNTA go enjoy your life and don't feel too sorry for your mom - she created this monster so she can deal with it", "NTA.  Why wouldn't you prioritize your life above theirs?  Don't let them confuse you like this.\n\nSo your sister's only reported issue is being diabetic?  This all sounds like she has mental issues and if she doesn't , then definitely NTA.  Diabetes can be challenging but can be managed but shouldn't require this level of support.  I have many friends and family that have managed Type 1 & 2 just fine.\n\nYour sister needs to learn to stand on her own two feet and take care of herself.  You and your mother helping her is not helping this at all.  \n\nMove away with your BF and only help in emergencies.  You deserve to have your own life and maybe your own kids to take care of, not your sister too.", "NTA.  Every adult needs to be able to take care of themselves and their own children.  Period. The end.  Live your life, be happy, and don't let them make you feel guilty!", "Well as mentioned above she is diabetic and she has never been able to accept this diagnosis... She finds it headrly unfair and it really has put her down... I've been wanting to let Het go to a psychologists for years since is suspect depression/burnout, but she refuses... So no... No diagnosis", "That all feels like it's on your sister, not you. At 28 years old, she has to learn that sometimes, life can be unfair.\n\nIt becomes more complicated if there's underlying mental problems, but you'd still be NTA even so. Live your life, OP!", "If type 1 totally unfair. If type 2 she needs to exercise and stop eating good to mitigate. I'm almost kidding.", "Shew, hard NTA. A girl I work w just recently got DX'ed w diabetes, has a port in her ...thigh or arm, can't remember, has to take insulin daily and monitor what she eats. Her hubs unfortunately is an alcoholic and basically does nothing to help ever, so not only does she work 3-4 days a week, she gets her 2 kids ready for school each morn, on the bus, has to cut her work day shorter to make sure she's home shortly after they get off the bus bc by then her hubs is drunk, does all the cooking and cleaning and errand running and kid rearing.... so while I'm sure it's a difficult diagnosis to get (I couldn't manage all of what my coworker has to do for it) your sis is perfectly capable of adulting and taking care of herself, but she won't as long as your mom is enabling her.", "You aren't too far off at times. Type 2 *can* be controlled by diet and exercise. It takes a lot of work, and I have heard that keto can work if you don't have kidney issues.\n\nI know, I am assuming, but I am leaning type 2 since 28 seems relatively *late* for type 1 to show up. T2, similarly to t1, can require a lot of lifestyle changes. That might be the main thing the sister is dealing with.\n\nI just hope for sisters' sake she is able to shape up before losing a foot or kidney."]}
