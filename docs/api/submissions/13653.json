Get on with your life.", "NTA and yes you are prioritizing your life, that is what you should be doing. You are not doing your sister any favors by enabling her lack of responsibility. Live your life, if your mother wants to continue enabling your sister that is her problem, she is making that decision", "Being diabetic doesn't stop anyone from living/being in control of their life. She's the queen of enabled weaponised incompetence. Time for her to grow up & be an adult. Stop enabling her.", "NTA. Your mom is TA for raising your sister to be incompetent and expecting you to play along forever.\n\nI'd not have said emergency basis as they're likely to have emergencies all over the place.\n\nYour sister needs to step up and get her stuff taken care of. It was never realistic to expect you to be subservient to her needs forever.", "How dare you do exactly what your sister has been doing since childhood; prioritise yourself over others! /s\n\nNTA go enjoy your life and don't feel too sorry for your mom - she created this monster so she can deal with it", "NTA.  Why wouldn't you prioritize your life above theirs?  Don't let them confuse you like this.\n\nSo your sister's only reported issue is being diabetic?  This all sounds like she has mental issues and if she doesn't , then definitely NTA.  Diabetes can be challenging but can be managed but shouldn't require this level of support.  I have many friends and family that have managed Type 1 & 2 just fine.\n\nYour sister needs to learn to stand on her own two feet and take care of herself.  You and your mother helping her is not helping this at all.  \n\nMove away with your BF and only help in emergencies.  You deserve to have your own life and maybe your own kids to take care of, not your sister too.", "NTA.  Every adult needs to be able to take care of themselves and their own children.  Period. The end.  Live your life, be happy, and don't let them make you feel guilty!", "Well as mentioned above she is diabetic and she has never been able to accept this diagnosis... She finds it headrly unfair and it really has put her down... I've been wanting to let Het go to a psychologists for years since is suspect depression/burnout, but she refuses... So no... No diagnosis", "That all feels like it's on your sister, not you. At 28 years old, she has to learn that sometimes, life can be unfair.\n\nIt becomes more complicated if there's underlying mental problems, but you'd still be NTA even so.

A girl I work w just recently got DX'ed w diabetes, has a port in her ...thigh or arm, can't remember, has to take insulin daily and monitor what she eats. Her hubs unfortunately is an alcoholic and basically does nothing to help ever, so not only does she work 3-4 days a week, she gets her 2 kids ready for school each morn, on the bus, has to cut her work day shorter to make sure she's home shortly after they get off the bus bc by then her hubs is drunk, does all the cooking and cleaning and errand running and kid rearing.... so while I'm sure it's a difficult diagnosis to get (I couldn't manage all of what my coworker has to do for it) your sis is perfectly capable of adulting and taking care of herself, but she won't as long as your mom is enabling her.", "You aren't too far off at times. Type 2 *can* be controlled by diet and exercise. It takes a lot of work, and I have heard that keto can work if you don't have kidney issues.\n\nI know, I am assuming, but I am leaning type 2 since 28 seems relatively *late* for type 1 to show up. T2, similarly to t1, can require a lot of lifestyle changes. That might be the main thing the sister is dealing with.\n\nI just hope for sisters' sake she is able to shape up before losing a foot or kidney.", "NTA Your sister is acting like an overgrown, entitled baby. BTW why she has no business having kids if she can't even do for herself. EVERYONE needs to stop doing for her and make her do for herself. You can't make your mother do that but you certainly can jump off this insane train.", "It makes sense for a parent to prioritize their minor child\u2019s life over their own, but what you are describing is highly irregular and toxic behavior in your sis and mom.

I would tell mom not only will you only be available for real emergencies, but you will not be taking care of her when your mother passes, so mom needs to figure out how that is going to work now.", "NTA, but you\u2019re going to be amazed at how picking up her kids from school or taking her to the store for a gallon of milk are suddenly going to become \u201cemergencies.\u201d What you should have said is that you will no longer be available.", "NTA - you ARE prioritizing your life over theirs... that is what people should do in a healthy environment. Your sister and mother have created a terrible situation (that you are a part of catering to) but you are making a new life for you with your BF and you should be responsible for someone that will not take care of themselves.", "NTA. I had a similar experience with my younger sister. She refused to do anything until I finally put my foot down. Youd be surprised how quickly they adapt and figure it out on their own.

Point blank, if they're trying to force you to stay then neither your sister nor your mother care about what you want. You should prioritize your life over them.\n\nRelationships are give and take. They're only taking from you. Your mother has failed as a parent by sacrificing you to enable your sister into becoming this. Your sister is a failure as a mother because this isn't healthy for a child to grow up in. Think about how you'd feel if your child was spoken to or treated like you were? Would you let it go on? Who\n\nYou need to drop the rope. Your sister won't grow up unless someone makes her. She has secure housing and doesn't have to worry about a job. Let her be your mother's problem.\n\nYou're not some dog trained to do whatever your family wants. If they can't treat you like a human being, then they don't deserve you. Be selfish, not selfless.", "NTA. Absolutely everyone (unless you are in jail) has a right to their own life. You have given enough of your life to a sister that was never taught to be responsible for herself. Your mother needs to finally teach your sister how to do things for herself or be willing to do it all herself. You have given more than enough of your life to your sister already.", "NTA. What in the actual heck is this arrangement? Go NC or LC.", "Yeah aren\u2019t they doing the exact same thing they\u2019re accusing op of? Putting their own lives first.

Please don't let your sister ruin your life and be ready to help her kids get away from her after HS.", "\"Yes, it is normal for a 25 year old to live her own life, so that's what I am going to do. It's extremely abnormal for someone like me to take care of a 28 year old sister who refuses to take care of her own health.

I was one of them, initially misdiagnosed as Type 2 in my mid 20s. It sucks, so much.\n\nBut OP's sister can't have someone hold her hand no matter which type of diabetes she has, as if she's ever in a position where she no longer has support... She might very well end up losing that hand, if she can't manage things by herself.", "Thank you for the information/correction :D\n\nThat sucks that you were misdiagnosed."]}
