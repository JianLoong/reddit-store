Your friend is though. How rude.", "Ouch. NTA. Your friend should have more tact", "NTA but don't Ghost him just because you're upset. Just explain to him your gift to him was one ticket. Not both.

I\u2019d just give him the tickets and rethink the whole friendship.", "YWBTA to ghost him. You should use your words and remind him you bought the tickets for him to join you as your treat, that you've been looking forward to it and it sucks that he's trying to cut you out.

NTA", "NTA. You wanted to do something special together with him and made it clear it was for you two to go together. \nPerhaps someone might argue it is OK for him to ask you just in case. But he should in no way expect you to say yes.", "NTA but you would be one if you rescinded the single ticket you gifted him the night before. Don't do that unless you're willing to end the friendship over this slight because that's an AH thing to do even if he was insensitive and tactless to start.", "ESH\n\nYou can have a conversation. Don't ghost friend because they upset you. It's childish behavior.", "Conditional NTA. Your friend is being an AH for trying to talk you out of your ticket for this comedy show so he can bring his wife. That\u2019s not very friend-like. Same thing can be said about your plan to ghost him. YWBTA if you do in fact ghost him. Be direct with him that you bought the tickets for the both of you and want to go, so he can either go with you or you can invite someone else. It\u2019s that simple.", "Nta. That\u2019s horrible for the friend to ask when this was your gift to him. You should explain to him that you\u2019re hurt he asked you, especially the way he did ( did you really wanna go? Harsh).

Or did you tell him you bought him tickets for the show?\n\nEdit: esh. The friend sucks for having tried to change the plans especially when it was a gift to share an experience with op.

You'd be no better than him (in fact, you'd be worse cause you'd be ghosting him) asking that question vs ghosting him and taking someone else.\n\nYou explain your feelings, he expresses his feelings, and the two of you can go from there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me be clear, that your friend is already an ah for asking that so close to the event date.

You have every right to say no to giving up your ticket, but not to ghost your friend to take someone else.", "Nta.  Even if you physically handed him to tickets wrapped in a box, with no mention of going together, it is implied one ticket is for you.", "NAH. Youhave every right to be frustrated for losing out on seeing the show and hanging out wuth your friend.\n\n\nI had something similar happen a few years ago. I was gifted some decent tickets to a game by a vendor. My SO really wanted to go and I basically felt like I had to choose her to keep her happy. The vendor was only slightly dissapointed even if he would be giving them to another client next time; he had already won the comtract and he had a budget for these. Oddly enough, she ended up drinking too much and had a terrible time in the cold, while my dude and I would have had a blast.\n\n\nAll in all, you gave a gift. If that gift is easier enjoyed with his wife than you so be it. It doesn't mean he wouldn't have more fun with you, just that it is totally easier on him at home.", "NTA\n\n\"So his response was unexpected and kinda stung. I am going to ghost him and take another friend instead. AITA?\"\n\nOn paper it's hard for me to understand someone who needs that many confirmations to have the plan set only for him to change his mind, but then again *my* married male best friend...\n\nI think the indirect approach is excusable AHness, long as you're okay paying the price later. If you're really best friends, you'll both get over it, else why would it be worth it?", "I'll go ESH.\nYou made it clear to your friend that you gifted him 1 ticket and you bought an accompanying ticket for yourself. So he is in the wrong for asking you to give up your ticket for his wife when he knew full well you gave him a night out with YOU.\n\nHowever you saying you're going to ghost him and take someone else instead is a complete AH move! That ticket is still his bday gift and from the sounds of it you didnt give him a chance to explain after his initial ask? Depending on your friends response after you told him the tickets were for you two and not his wife, this might even go full yta instead of esh.", "So you bought him one ticket as a gift? And now you want to take it back because he wants to go with someone else? That\u2019s not the right move and YWBTA if you do that. \n\nTalk to your friend. It\u2019s obvious he didn\u2019t understand that you were gifting him just the one ticket next to you. Also his wife might be feeling left out putting your friend into a tough spot. Discuss the situation and see if you can come up with plan together. Maybe he buys his wife a ticket and you let them sit together then all go to dinner after the show so you can talk about the best and worst parts and socialize. Or maybe you take another friend and replace his \u201cgift\u201d with something else. You\u2019re friends, talk this out.", "ESH...\n\nHow did this even happen?  Whenever I've bought tix for someone, I give them the gift of a future date with me.  How does he think both tix are his, and how do you think both tix are yours?\n\n:-/", "YTA instead of having a conversation, you ghosted him with his bday present. I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s unexpected for someone to want to bring their SO. Part of why their the SO.", "YTA if you act like a small child and retaliate by ghosting him and punish him by taking back his birthday gift.  \n\nYes it hurt your feelings that is understandable but it his birthday he can do as he likes with his present.    But it does sound like the gift you gave him was actually a gift for yourself.", "Maybe his wife really needs a night out and is giving him a hard time about going out without her.

It probably was a digital gift and OP assumed friend would understand they were going together and friend assumed OP had given him both tickets so he could bring wife.

Make peace, not war.", "Did he know this ahead of time?", "I think the two situations are similar.

I\u2019m just surmising here. Perhaps OP prefers to take the wife? My friends are more valuable than any amount of money.

I guess I'm lucky in the sense that my best friend and I have ZERO issues being honest with each other. If my friend has an issue with something, he'll tell me right off the rip. I think it's childish to wait until the day before to say \"hey man, you mind if I take SO instead?\" It's all the timing.", "OK, I misunderstood. NTA. Your friend is treating you like crap right now.", "I get that. Only OP would know if this action by his \u201cbest friend\u201d is the catalyst for ending the friendship.
