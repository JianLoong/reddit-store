Maybe he buys his wife a ticket and you let them sit together then all go to dinner after the show so you can talk about the best and worst parts and socialize.

Set your boundaries and be firm with them.", "Perfect reply", "And that\u2019s ok. \n\nIt would actually be the mature thing to do, to tell him that you\u2019re a bit upset about it - that part of the present for you was spending time with him. \n\nAs my therapist often says, we tend to hide whatever we\u2019re feeling in this kind of situation because we think we \u201cshouldn\u2019t\u201d share it. But it would be much better than ghosting him. \n\nIt\u2019s ok to be hurt & upset. It\u2019s a pretty good idea to sense check those emotions to see if you\u2019re being over sensitive or not. The conclusion on this post (which I agree with) is that you\u2019re NTA for being upset. \n\nBut once you\u2019ve had a little time to work through the hurt & upset, if your friend is generally kind & thoughtful, it\u2019s probably reasonable to assume he had good intentions. Maybe he\u2019s been mad busy with work recently & hasn\u2019t had much time for wife & she was momentarily a bit FOMO - so he thought it would be ok to ask. For all he knew, you might have been equally snowed under with work / poorly with the flu, & glad for the excuse to skip the show & reschedule to catch up with him at a later date. \n\nIf there\u2019s no previous \u201cvibe\u201d with either him or his wife, it would be reasonable to assume he was asking \u201cjust in case\u201d it suited you to drop out and is perfectly happy for you to still go as originally planned since you are still available.", "How old are you and the guy you gifted a ticket to? And how long have you been friends?", "I would absolutely love to hear this little story from the best friend or wife's perspective.", "Tell him your gift only included the price of one ticket. if you don't mind not going he pays for yours, otherwise it's not his ticjet to give away and he should consider buying a single for his wife if he is that desperate.", "Or you can tell him if he really wants the wife to go with, then he can purchase her a ticket instead of wanting you to give up yours. He already knew that one was for him and the other for you. I don't know the price you paid for or the seats, but i wouldn't give up my ticket i bought for myself because my friend wants to bring their spouse instead. This would be my suggestion and if they disagree then i would ask them to pay me for their ticket so i can take someone else with me.", "Take the high road but definitely get your point across lol.", "Do we know OP is male ??", "NTA. It was very clear, they even discussed that both was eager to see the comedian together. OP still have both tickets.", "Info: Are you a woman?

Maybe the friend would rather just hang out with his wife instead of OP.  He\u2019s an AH but understandable he rather be with his wife.  Doesn\u2019t mean she won\u2019t let him out of her sight.  Again the friend is an AH for asking.", "I don't think OP is male.

Instead of just talking to him about it.. he even says he wants to ghost him.. rather than have a civil talk..\n\nIdk but for me that isnt the way to go about it...", "That would make him an AH. He promised the guy a ticket so he has the at the very least give that ticket. OP should keep the second ticket.", "Well, maybe there is more to this story?", "Why is it giving in though? You approach this friendship as if they need to keep track of their plus and minus actions towards eachother?\n\nIn my friendships I just want my friends to be happy. And if that means giving my ticket to the wife so my friend is happy. (Yes even if that was not the original agreement) Then I'd rather do that and do something else with my friend, instead of losing the friendship entirely?\n\nI would still talk to them about how it made me feel that they made that choice and tall that out. And if we cant get past that, then I'd end the friendship. BUT not before trying..", "I second this. I\u2019m the queen of taking thing to heart that weren\u2019t meant that way. Sometimes the feelings are valid, sometimes it\u2019s jumping to conclusions that never existed. Talk to him.", "YAH. Everyone is assuming OP is a dude. What if it\u2019s not? \n\nI bought you a date out with me for your bday! What do you mean you want to take your wife instead??", "It really depends. If the tickets were digital and OP just said, \u201cFor your birthday I bought two tickets to see this comedy show.\u201d And then didn\u2019t clarify and just assumed his friend would know it was meant for OP to get the second ticket. Then there\u2019s confusion and misunderstanding that can be solved by talking it out. Note if OP said, \u201cFor your birthday I\u2019m taking you to see this show.\u201d Then that\u2019s pretty clear. See there are ways that the friend might have misunderstood and now wife is also excited to go. Talking to his friend is OPs only solution. Either request the friend to purchase the second ticket, have the friend buy the wife a separate ticket and they all go together or OP \u201cbuys\u201d back the gift with a different gift to replace it and takes someone else. If OP just ghosts friend then he\u2019s definitely an AH.\n\nEdit: So I see his comment that he was very clear it was only one ticket. Still talking to the friend and expressing that he\u2019s disappointed and if there was a compromise somewhere is better than ghosting him.", "I\u2019m wondering exactly this, too. Specially because it rubs me the wrong way that OP left out the genders and I\u2019m starting to wonder if it was on purpose.", "I never said I approve of op ghosting his friend.

The gift is going to a show with his friend. Since he no longer seems to want to go to the show with his friend, he\u2019s rejected the whole gift and gets nothing. Op, keep both tickets.

It could be a girl bff which would explain a lot more of the situation\u2026", "Sure if he tells him and he\u2019s on board with his wife not getting the second on but if he doesn\u2019t want OP to use the second one I would give him neither tickets", "All giving the ticket away will do is establish op as a doormat who doesn\u2019t stand up for himself. If you give in to people being AHs just to appease them and make them happy you just encourage them to be AHs again in the future to get what they want.", "I will say this... Based on their writing style and use of emojis in the comments I absolutely do not believe that they are a straight male. So there's that.", "Totally agree. Seems suspicious and there hasn\u2019t been any answer to the question just edits that don\u2019t address the full situation.", "I used \"this guy\" as gender neutral, but I agree. OP is giving me weird vibes and may be some kind of weird female friend vying for one on one time with a married man.", "See I dont see it as giving in to make them happy.. or becoming a doormat.\n\nOPs friend asked them to give the ticket to their wife (foul play, we agree) but we dont even know what happened between them after that? Did the friend get angry? Did they insist? Or did they agree with OP to go together? We dont know.\n\nAll we know is OP saying they would ghost them and take someone else? Which is imo a very agressive approach to a friends question. \nAnd an action that would for sure ruin the friendship... if OP cared about the friendship enough to buy these tickets in the first place then I assume the friendship means something to OP? Right? \nSo I am saying that ghosting the friend and taking someone else warrents the ESH judgement.\n\nAnd as an alternative I offered the option of OP giving the ticket to the wife to make the friend happy. BUT ONLY in the case that the friend accepted that it was rude to OP and that they do something else together to make up for this missed outing (where the friend foots the bill). Because if like OP says it was really all about spending time together then the friend apologising, having a good time with his wife, and making it up to OP by taking him out seems like a reasonable way to resolve this between two understanding adults that can communicate and dont get b*tthurt about every little thing like a bunch of teenagers....\n\nDoesnt make OP a doormat, makes him an adult", "Agreed", "Totally agree.", "I really don\u2019t see it as a very little thing. \n\nFirst of all, if op\u2019s friend had just asked and then dropped it and decided to go with op, and op was still thinking about ghosting him, I would agree that maybe ESH would be appropriate. But we have no evidence that that is what happened, and it just makes more sense to assume that op\u2019s issue is legitimate and not manufactured.\n\nSecond, being treated this way by a friend is no small spat. It\u2019s disrespectful, hurtful, and cruel. It warrants a proportional response.", ">if op\u2019s friend had just asked and then dropped it and decided to go with op, and op was still thinking about ghosting him, I would agree that maybe ESH would be appropriate. But we have no evidence that that is what happened,\n\nYes but that is my point exactly, we have NO idea what happends next? All OP says is: I told him I bought them for us, I was hurt. So I am going to ghost him and take someone else...\n\nAnd that is my issue.. like we are all assuming that the friend did waaaay more than that. But all it says in the post is that he asked if OP really wanted to go cause he was thinking of taking his wife... thats it...\n\nSo from what I read the friend did exactly this:\n>if op\u2019s friend had just asked and then dropped\n\nSo, for me, unless OP can give more info about what happened after. OP reacted like an AH with the ghosting.. imo\n\nAnd yes I agree with ur 2nd point that it is rude and hurtfull. But I say that saving the friendship is better than relatiating...\nNo OP shouldnt roll over and give in.. but going on the offense just to serve some \"justice\" just doesnt seem right to me either.. hence my semi neutral verdict and suggestions.\n\nYou know what I mean?:p", "I see what you mean. From my point of view, a friendship that is already so on the rocks where a) the friend is acting like a jerk and trying to swap out op for his wife and b) the friendship is so fragile that it could end because op takes the tickets and runs, is simply not a friendship worth saving. The way my friends and I are, if one of them did something like this to me, I would absolutely retaliate and then we\u2019d not talk for a week or so and then get over it and be friends again. But maybe not everyone is like that with their friends, idk. Frankly, sometimes revenge is fun and some people deserve it, but you have to do the math and make sure the revenge is enough to get your point across but not enough to fuck up the relationship entirely.", ">and b) the friendship is so fragile that it could end because op takes the tickets and runs, is simply not a friendship worth saving.\n\nI didnt look at it this way yet, you may have a point there.\n\nI think in the back of my mind I have been seeing the friend asking OP to give the ticket to his wife as more of an error in judgement rather than purposely being a jerk. Like I see him thinking: \"Well OP gave me this ticket, It'd be really nice to take my wife though, why don't I ask ask him and see if he would be okay with it if I took my wife instead\"-  But I may be just too much of an optimist and seeing the best in people there haha I never really saw it as the friend actively thinking: \"I would rather go with my wife so OP should give me the other ticket as well, sucks to be him\"\nAnd to be fair without knowing the following texts between OP and friend we wont fully know which one of those two it really was.\n\nBut you're right I may have judged a little too much based on how I myself would handle this haha\n\n>The way my friends and I are,\n\nYeah I think how we act with our own friends is very telling for how we see this haha cause I see OP ghosting him and taking the ticket as an act with the intention to really hurt his friend. And you see it as a relatively mellow way to get even with his friend:p\n\nYou've got me doubting between ESH and NTA now haha (which is a big step for me because I was firmly on team: OP is a child for his reaction, before)\n\nHonestly I wish OP would just give us more info about what happened after the texts from his posts.. that would really clear things up:p"]}
