Do you usually find it so easy to call your gf a bitch and a mother fucker? And no it isn't involuntary. I can guarantee if your boss did a prank to you like this you would have reacted differently. \n\nI'm super surprised at the NTA votes. Yes pranks are lame but this was just a funny harmless thing and she did not deserve to be called names like that. I would dump you.", "YTA\n\n\nSounds like a really harmless prank and your reaction to it just sounds werid.\n\n\nI normally don't like pranks but with the prank nothing got destroyed, no one got hurt or scared and no one gut himiliated. I don't know...", "Probably YTA - it doesn't sound like you were scared or in any danger so yeah you overreacted, and if you don't have any problem-solving skills and just resort to cussing people out and getting angry over a little frustration that's not a good trait to have.   I mean, if she let it go on for hours or laughed at you at lot while you were trying to fix it then maybe a little more leeway, but, like, still, some people don't ever name-call even when they're mad and having a fight and that's a hard line for them, which is fair.  You might just be incompatible ad it's better she knows now.", "I think pranks are not my thing, and for the most part find them to be majorly asshole-ish (this is is not her being and asshole)... However the punishment doesn't fit the game. \n\nHer changing the language to Spanish on everything does not hurt you, but you hurt her. You acted like a child and called her horrible names and shouted at her. YTA. She deserves someone better. Not someone that overreacts, but then trying to say she overacted (which she didn't), and someone how has a LOT of going up to do. (You act like you just hit puberty, and cannot control your emotions.)", "YTA\n\nThat was a completely harmless prank, easy to fix and you massively overreacted, swearing and insulting her. Especially because you said it was involuntary. You need to get control of that. You can't just involuntary swear and curse and insult people whenever they do the slightest thing to upset you, it could land you in big trouble one day.", "YTA\n\nSurely you know cussing people out, especially someone you are seeing, is a bad idea.", "Nta - when you prank someone be ready for blowback", "Nta my grandson changed my headphones lang to Korean. Had to use a translater to change it back.", "NAH\n\nIf you laughed afterwards and made up. I mean it was a spur of the moment cussing right? Did you apologise for your excessive behaviour and explain it was a spur of the moment thing? Then you're all fine. Maybe learn a little anger management, helps in the long run. But yeah aside from that your fine. Start thinking of a way to prank her back.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You can't tell someone how they should react to being disrespected. A harmless prank is one thing but calling her outside of her name is not funny and she has a right to be upset. This is a small situation tho definitely no reason for anyone to be the ah here just apologize and move on.", "YTA\n\nAnd for the people saying he's not, did you not read the part where he called her the b word and cussed her out? \nGetting pissed or irritated makes sense but cussing out someone you're seeing?
