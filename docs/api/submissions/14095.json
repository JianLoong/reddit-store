{"id": 14095, "submission_id": "12d32k0", "title": "AITA for wanting to know why my stepdaughter was crying at the very beginning of a movie?", "selftext": "My (50sF) stepdaughter (SD, 26F) is visiting. She never wants to talk about anything under surface level, but we've been dealing with it. Last night, we were watching a movie she requested, even though husband and I weren't into it (my son \\[16M\\] was). The opening showed some nice sweeping shots of marshes and animals. A few minutes into the movie, before there's even any dialogue, and SD has tears running down her face!\n\nSD is, to put it bluntly, a crybaby. She has cried since the day I met her when she was 7. If we yelled or disciplined her, she would burst into tears and be so hysterical that she couldn't speak. I assumed this was a manipulation tactic but it never went away.\n\nBack to the movie, I pause and tell SD to tell me why she's crying. The movie hasn't even started. To my surprise, she can speak clearly. She even laughs and says that she doesn't know why, but crying is her response to any strong emotion. She explains that she had read the book and was blown away at the beautiful shots and \"cinematography\" and it \"elicited her tear response\". I tell her this is ridiculous, that she can't tear up just because she thinks something is really pretty.\n\nShe blew up on me. She told me that she was stretching the truth and does actually know why her body does this. She claims that it's because of her childhood and how terrified she was and now she apparently literally cries at everything. She cries when she's happy, sad, angry, excited, etc, and claims that she can't control it. She cried all through telling me this and tells me that whenever she sees a movie, she's in tears through all of it and she thinks it's my fault for how I \"treated her\". \n\nI shut off the movie and told her to go to sleep if that's how she feels. She packed her things and left on the first flight back home. My husband is on my side but my son is angry and telling me I f\\*ed up. I just don't think that crying because something impressed her is a response that's going to work in the real world.

Second, that\u2019s none of your business if she is crying.

Apparently very. \n\nYou were the asshole when you then berated her after she humored you with a reasonable explanation and then tried to send her to bed? Again, WTF?? \n\nI\u2019ll tell you what lady, there is someone in this story who is deeply manipulative and has no emotional self regulation, and that person is you.", "YTA, and I'm so happy to hear that this girl has made her escape. There's a reason that she doesn't talk about anything below the surface with you. It's for her own comfort and safety. You invalidate everything she says or feels as a \"manipulation tactic\" or \"ridiculous.\" She probably dreads these visits.   \nIf it's not completely clear to you how inappropriate your behaviour is, I'd suggest doing some basic research on crying as a reflex, and a coping response, e.g., \"health benefits of crying.\"", "YTA and also you don\u2019t get to tell people when to cry or not cry. My kiddo (12f) is very much a happy crier and I find it so sweet and endearing. It\u2019s a quality that makes her unique and beautiful. She cried in the car today over a really exciting thing she got to participate in and honestly I find that so special that she can experience such strong emotions. I don\u2019t see why it\u2019s such a problem for you, like who the hell do you think you are to \u201cdemand\u201d someone explain themselves to you. Plenty of people cry at the sight of beauty.

Who the hell are you to gatekeeper someone\u2019s emotions, to determine how they can react to something? For the record, it\u2019s quite possible to cry over something pretty. I cried the first time I saw the Grand Canyon because I was so overwhelmed by it. I cried when I saw the sunrise over the Maasai Mara because it was breathtaking. I\u2019m sorry your life has been so dull that you\u2019ve never witnessed anything breathtaking.", "YTA. You\u2019re not entitled to an explanation for anyone else\u2019s emotions.

You clearly don\u2019t want judgment, you want an Internet mob to confirm your belief that you\u2019re right. Well, you\u2019re wrong. Yelling can absolutely scar children, and it sounds like you have been belittling her for almost 20 years instead of accepting her.\n\nAlso, she\u2019s a grown-ass adult, and you don\u2019t have to worry about whether crying will affect her professional life. You could just concentrate on trying to be less of an AH, instead of trying to police her emotions.\n\nAlso, how could you not say WHAT MOVIE it is? I can\u2019t be the only one dying to know.", "YTA\n\nGetting frustrated at someone crying? Who cares why she cried! Movies are supposed to bring out feelings, whether that\u2019s anger or sadness or something else, otherwise it\u2019s just a waste of money.

She\u2019s been a shouty jerk since she met me when I was 7.  Instead of engaging in reasoned debate, she shouted and imposed arbitrary punishments on me, like a jerk.  She\u2019d be so jerkish I was driven to tears of frustration.

She never wants to talk about anything under surface level, but we've been dealing with it. Last night, we were watching a movie she requested, even though husband and I weren't into it (my son \\[16M\\] was). The opening showed some nice sweeping shots of marshes and animals. A few minutes into the movie, before there's even any dialogue, and SD has tears running down her face!\n\nSD is, to put it bluntly, a crybaby. She has cried since the day I met her when she was 7. If we yelled or disciplined her, she would burst into tears and be so hysterical that she couldn't speak. I assumed this was a manipulation tactic but it never went away.\n\nBack to the movie, I pause and tell SD to tell me why she's crying. The movie hasn't even started. To my surprise, she can speak clearly. She even laughs and says that she doesn't know why, but crying is her response to any strong emotion. She explains that she had read the book and was blown away at the beautiful shots and \"cinematography\" and it \"elicited her tear response\". I tell her this is ridiculous, that she can't tear up just because she thinks something is really pretty.\n\nShe blew up on me. She told me that she was stretching the truth and does actually know why her body does this. She claims that it's because of her childhood and how terrified she was and now she apparently literally cries at everything. She cries when she's happy, sad, angry, excited, etc, and claims that she can't control it. She cried all through telling me this and tells me that whenever she sees a movie, she's in tears through all of it and she thinks it's my fault for how I \"treated her\". \n\nI shut off the movie and told her to go to sleep if that's how she feels. She packed her things and left on the first flight back home. My husband is on my side but my son is angry and telling me I f\\*ed up. I just don't think that crying because something impressed her is a response that's going to work in the real world. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I am still in therapy for \"some yelling\" and things of the like, myself, that were deemed 'not a big deal' and 'not able to cause these problems'. When these things happen during formative years, it can take a LONG time to work past it and heal to reduce behaviors associated with those things. I have no doubt based on how you described her own description of her emotional issues that how you interacted with her as a child did, in fact, traumatize her, regardless of if you see it that way(or meant to hurt her) or not.

She tried to not make a big deal of it, and you made her anyways, which made her reveal your impact on her. Not only did you contribute to the problem, but you made her talk about it, and then proceeded to act like this when she did so despite clearly not wanting to(given her trying to brush it off before you probed). You didn't even try to comfort her or talk it out after forcing it out of her. You told her to go to bed, like she's a seven year old arguing with you over dinner. You shut her down. You don't even seem to actually care about her and her issues with emotions. All you seem to care about is that someone is pointing the finger at you, and you clearly seem to think you've done nothing wrong despite evidence that you have. I wonder what her therapist would say about you and your impact on her, if she had one. \n\nI'd be sincerely surprised if you hear from her very much after this. If you replicate this behavior with your son- who already appears to have some idea what you're doing and have been doing for years- be prepared to lose him, too. \n\nLet me leave this here as a final note, because I remembered this as I read your post, mostly lines 2-4.
