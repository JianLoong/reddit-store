Just to preface, most of my family never acknowledges me. I have about three other family members who\u2019s birthdays are days from mine yet I\u2019m the only person who\u2019s birthday is forgotten. No one in my family \u201cinvites\u201d me to anything. My own brothers get invited to things days or a week in advance. Then I get to see all the fun things they did on social media. When I bring anything up they say \u201cwell if you saw the posts why didn\u2019t you head over?\u201d And I tell them I don\u2019t feel right heading over somewhere I wasn\u2019t invited. \nWell then today happened. My family texted each other in the family group chat about a party for my sister in laws business being a year old. Mind you it\u2019s my birthday today. No one acknowledged it. So I got fed up and said \u201cthank you to the people who told me happy birthday. It was nice to be thought of by some of you\u201d most of them went on the defense saying I didn\u2019t give them enough time. And that the day wasn\u2019t even over yet. I got fed up and pretty much blew up the chat saying it\u2019s not just about this one Birthday. It\u2019s everything I never get invited to. I told them all how much I love them and I just want to be included in their lives. I\u2019m getting called overdramatic and making myself a victim. My sister in law even private messaged me and pretty much said it\u2019s because I\u2019m different and that\u2019s why I don\u2019t get invited to things. I\u2019m autistic and have a hard time communicating with others so that really hurt my feelings. The only person who\u2019s admitted they\u2019ve done wrong is my brothers who told me they\u2019ll do better. But everyone is saying I\u2019m dramatic and shouldn\u2019t have made it a big deal. AITA? I want to post the texts on here but I also don\u2019t want their pictures on the internet like that, or for their numbers to be seen. I still care for them that much. I think I may be TA because I know I\u2019m dramatic.

You deserve to be included and your SIL deserves to have everyone know what a witch she is.", "NTA\n\nIt really sounds like a shitty situation. And I'm reacting with anger because shitty entitled families trigger me something special. It shouldn't require a unique alignment of the stars to have healthy relationships with your immediate family and yet it seems rather rare on this Reddits.\n\nI'm sorry your family is bullshit. And your sister at the very least needs a seminar on kindness. It's because you're *different*? \"Well thanks and I guess fuck *you* too.\"\n\nWould you be friends with any of these people? Probably not. If they don't want you around, you don't need to be around them. Focus your energy on finding and maintaining relationships with people who WANT you around and protect yourself from the people who make you feel invisible. \n\nIf they won't notice your absence anyway because you got better people to hang with, how can ghosting them hurt their feelings?", "Big NTA.  \n\nYou may be autistic but you're very well spoken (more so than a lot of neurotypical folks).  You explained it perfectly here-- the problem is not this birthday, it's every birthday and every other situation where you are an afterthought.  \n\nYou shouldn't be an afterthought.  You're very much not an asshole for calling them out.", "I'm sorry that your family is full of ahs. Your SIL should be ashamed of herself. I would let everyone know what she said to you. She owes you an apology for that. Don't let anyone tell you that you're being dramatic. If they accuse of it again ask them how they would feel if they were in your shoes. Would it be dramatic then?", "It doesn't matter if you're being dramatic or not, you're still valid. Being left out feels like shit and they're not doing anything to solve the situation/compromise, instead they're weaponizing your autism against you. It shouldn't be a reason for them to pull back from you and invalidate you.\n\nNTA", "NTA, happy birthday and I hope you'll find people with whom you can celebrate it, have a great time and don't feel guilty for your feelings that are completely justified in your situation.  Good luck", "You\u2019re absolutely not blowing this out of proportion or being over dramatic. I\u2019m sorry your family is full of inconsiderate aholes who keep on excluding you even though you have pointed out that it bothers you and that you\u2019d like to be included. The bit about you being different is a cop out. Family is supposed to be there for you, love you, despite the differences.\n\nHappy Birthday! May you find the love you deserve this year and build a family of friends that cherish, respect and love you \u2665\ufe0f", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
