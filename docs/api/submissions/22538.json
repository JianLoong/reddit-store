And maybe you can also ask your SIL if there's something specific you've done at previous social events that make them not want to invite you, and what's her advice for those situations in future. Basically you should be more direct and honest about your feelings and your needs in advance, instead of bottling it all up and then making passive aggressive comments at the last moment.", "I know exactly how that feels.

Relationships are a two way street and they really do need reciprocity to flourish, do you make a habit of always wishing them happy birthday and doing the things you want them to do for you, for them?\n\nThe picture I've gotten from reading your comments is that you're a bit ostracized, but it could also be that they're simply returning the level of commitment you demonstrate to them right back to you.", "You're different, probably not the easiest person to deal with - but thats what family does - accepts and even embraces differences and loves and respects each other equally.  NTA for wanting to be treated like family.    Your reaction to being treated badly is not the Drama - being treated badly is the Drama.", "Look, if you want to not talk to your family for now - or forever - you're NTA. They clearly aren't willing to go through any effort to reach out to you, and that's the question you actually asked.\n\nHowever, it's never great to passive-aggressively vague post about things. You were badly provoked, and I completely understand your feelings, but it's just not a good idea. Next time you feel the urge, even if it's *totally* justified, ask if there's some better way to let people know you're angry. Or, indeed, if it'll be profitable to let them know at all. If they're just going to harass you about how terrible you are for having feelings, is it really worth it to let them know they suck?", ">pretty much said it\u2019s because I\u2019m different and that\u2019s why I don\u2019t get invited to things. I\u2019m autistic\n\nI was waiting for something like this to explain their behavior, though my first guess was that you were LGBTQ.\n\nNTA. They're being deliberately rude and excluding you on purpose, and it seems like they're doing so *just* because you're autistic. Disgusting.", "NTA. Happy birthday love \ud83e\udd73", "Nta\n\n\nIt sucks to always be left out and forgotten. It\u2019s the same in my family. Hell my mom had to basically force my dad and brother into including me on a outing the other day where they were meeting up with my other brothers family. \n\nGood for you for speaking up. And your sister in law sounds like the asshole.", "It's not gonna help. Those people who went on the attack are going to *stay* on the attack and make OP into the bad guy for this action, and then SIL's going to get all the sympathy.", "I get that you're trying to be helpful with this, but some of this advice is super harmful. \n\nWhy should they have to message each person individually? That's can be a lot of work depending on how many people are in the chat. And it was something that everyone in the chat needed to be told. \n\nTheir family shouldn't have to be told that they would like something for their birthday. They should tell them happy birthday at the very least without OP needing to remind them.\n\nIn regards to asking for specific invites, it sounds like OP has done that many times. Tbh it seems like the family is just using \"you should've just come\" as an excuse given that they directly invited others. \n\nThe last bit is the harmful part. The SIL already said they don't invite OP because they're \"different\" which is a clear reference to OP being autistic. While I don't think that this is what you intended, by suggesting that she ask for SIL's advice, you're suggesting that she mask heavily for all family events so that her family can include their \"normal\" version of her (normal in quotes to indicate that that is likely what the family believes). Not only is masking exhausting (and often harmful to the autistic person), you are effectively telling OP that they who they are is not acceptable or okay without modification from their harmful family. By reaching out to SIL for advice,  OP would also open themselves up to more ableism that will do nothing but harm. \n\nOP please know that you are not being dramatic or a problem. Your family is being ableist and cruel, then relying on your self-doubt to get away with it. They expect you to believe that you've made some social mistake so that you back down and let them continue to treat you as less than. I'm not gonna tell you what to do with your relationship cause that's for you to decide, but know that you are not wrong here. \n\nNTA and Happy Birthday"]}
