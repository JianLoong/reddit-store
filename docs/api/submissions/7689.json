We announced to our close family and friends that we were pregnant at 11 weeks along. We said that we would be waiting to share until I was further along. My mother ignored us and posted our pregnancy news on her social media immediately. We got congratulations messages from dozens of people. When we learned that she shared it, we told her to delete it as it was not her news to share. She argued, saying things like, \"I'm the grandma, it's absolutely my news to share\", \"you cannot tell me what I can and cannot post online\", and so on. She finally took down her post after we begged and begged her.\nSkip to 20 weeks along. We got asked what his name was going to be. When we said we weren't going to share, no one complained, except my mom. She constantly asked and would try to trip us up. After three weeks of her asking 3-4 times a day what \"her\" baby's name is, I decided to tell her that baby's name is \"John\". That's not true, but I wanted her to stop asking what his name was going to be. I then told her that she must keep it fully confidential and that NO ONE else can know his name until he was born. I figured that she would leave it be and not tell anyone. That was a mistake. \nMy mom, aunts, and cousins threw us a baby shower. Everything seemed normal, except for a few people whispering and pointing at the gifts. I didn't think anything of it until I began opening the gifts. The first gifts were gifts from our registry. Then, I got a gift from my cousin, of a set of monogrammed blankets and pillows. I was confused as we hadn't said what the baby's name/initials were. I then opened my aunt's gift, which was a decorative frame with the name \"John\". I got upset and my mom grinned. My mom then stood up, shushed the room and said, \"I know OP wasn't going to share it until after, but the baby's name is John!\" It was awkward. Everyone looked confused. Those who my mom had already told stood around looking smug.\nI got up and whispered to her that we were not going to name the baby John. I had told her that so she would stop pressuring me to share the name. My mom's face got red and she mumbled something and left, along with many of my aunts and cousins on her side. The party was pretty much ruined after this so I returned the personalized gifts and went home. I received calls from my mom's side saying that it was awful to embarrass my mom. My husband said she wouldn't have been embarrassed if she had kept the name private. \nOur baby came a few days after his due date. All of this drama has caused a lot of stress with my mom and family on her side. My husband, dad, and in-laws are incredibly supportive and have been gushing over our baby. My mom and her side have been saying rude things about us to the rest of the family. AITA for telling my mom the wrong name and embarrassing her in front of her family?

Your mother has continued to prove that she is untrustworthy and selfish. Clearly you didn\u2019t want to be in a position to have to lie to her, but she was being relentless. NTA, I\u2019m sorry your mom has so little respect for you and your privacy, and congrats on the baby!", "NTA honestly I find this quite funny so I\u2019m sorry it has stressed you so. \n\nShe is TA and if she told anyone accompanied with, \u2018you aren\u2019t supposed to know yet\u2019 then they are TA too for getting personalized gifts. If those gift-givers were not given the information as a secret then I just feel bad she misled them but being rude to her makes more sense than you..", "NTA. No name is set in stone until baby is born anyways. Loads of pregnant couples throw names around and end up going for a completely different name when the time comes. \n\nAlso, it seems your mother is an attention seeker. Making everything about her, even standing up at your baby shower and announcing the name for you. Is she going to demand to be the first one in the room after you give birth? Be the first person to feed your child? Give your child a bath and post the pictures without your permission? \n\nYour mother needs to be given a stern talking to and if she continues to think she has the right to violate your privacy then distancing is needed.\n\nEDIT: I just noticed you already had your child, but the sentiment remains the same. If you don't sort this behaviour she will steal a lot of firsts from you and your child.", "NTA - your mother repeatedly tried to or disrespected your boundaries. To placate her and to stop her from pestering you just tossed a name out there, cant blame you. But then she further proved you right - she couldnt be trusted.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t embarrass her. She embarrassed herself. It never would have lead to embarrassment if she didn\u2019t defy your wishes and tell people things that are none of their business. The baby\u2019s name is no one else\u2019s business until you decide to release it.", "NTA - Your mom embarrassed herself.", "NTA. Well played, mama. Well played.", "NTA. Your mom wouldn't have embarrassed herself - and she DID embarrass herself, she has literally no one to blame except for herself - if she'd kept her mouth shut. Honestly, I laughed reading this. Good for you! Hopefully she's learned something useful for the future!", "NTA... you let her in on a secret the first time and she went and blabbed to the entire world on her socials.  The she hounded and hounded you because she just HAD to know theembarassment next secret... it's entirely on HER for once again blabbing to everyone and taking both of those moments from you... She deserved every ounce of embarrassment.  \n\nHell, in your place I'd have left the registry completely unisex, told her the baby was a girl and given her some traditional girl's name... then... \"surprise... the baby's a boy, and we're naming him Harry\" But I'm a bit malicious... fool me once, shame on you, you don't get a second chance.", "NTA. Your mother continuously disrespected your boundaries and betrayed your trust, so this is what she gets. Embarrassment is temporary, she\u2019ll be okay. Hopefully this makes her learn her lesson on betraying trust.", "Not only are you NTA, but you are a whole ass rock star. \n\nYou didn't embarrass your mom. She embarrassed herself.  All she had to do was keep your confidence.  She chose not to.\n\nThat's on her.", "Nta maybe if she had kept her mouth closed she wouldn't of embarrassed herself", "NTA\n\nCongrats on you new addition to the family.\n\nI think your mother needs to be on an information diet as relates to your child. Any information you don't want to be shared with everyone you should keep away from her as I don't think she's learnt her lesson. Applies to pictures too if you're thinking to limit the information on social media about your child. If you don't use it I'd recommend the sub r/justnomil", "NTA, you told her a secret and she blabbed it, KNOWING that you didn\u2019t want to share the name. Honestly where do some propel get off? That was incredibly selfish of your mother to disrespect your wishes like that. Hopefully your lie will knock her down a peg.", "NTA\n\nYour mother is a selfish idiot.", "NTA. Your mother is awful and will continue to be and won\u2019t respect your rules for your child after. Better to put an end to her behaviour now.", "NTA", "\"I don't understand what you mean about embarrassing my mom... If she'd kept her word, she wouldn't have embarrassed herself. And obviously, her actions demonstrate that we were right not to trust her with information we wanted kept confidential.\"\n\nNTA. People who refuse to accept \"no\" for an answer have forfeited the right to receive truthful information from you. Particularly someone like your mother, who actively weaponizes whatever you tell her.\n\nAnyone who continues to try to discuss this with you should be told, \"I'm not going to discuss my mother's behavior again. She's a grown woman and she's responsible for her own decisions. Now, was there something else that you wanted to discuss or should we end the phone call/visit?\"", "NTa\n\n\"When someone lies to me, I lie to them, do not bring this up to me again.\"", "Lol do you really have to ask? She did it to herself", "NTA. Your mother brought this on herself by disregarding your request to keep the info to herself.", "NTA. Your mother clearly has no self control and she loves the attention she gets from spilling the beans.", "nta\nyou deserve respect \nyou always have but i'm guessing you have not been given that from your mom - as a grown up and a parent now - you are allowed to choose when and how to share your news.  \nYour mom had her time to do this kind of thing when she was a parent to be and a new parent - if she can't deal with that then it's time to go for low contact. \nCongrats on the arrival of your child!", "NTA, this is entirely her own doing.", "NTA. Your story reminds me of when we had our kids. My mom is not exactly like your mom, but she was one of those people who always has to complain about everything. We didn\u2019t want her trying to tell us to choose a different name all the time, so we told everyone that our child was going to be named Fester. Nobody took us seriously, but they didn\u2019t keep asking us, because they knew we were just going to keep answering \u201cFester\u201d.", "NTA. Your mom is a narcissist who is trying to make your pregnancy all about her, and she deserves to get a bit of an ego puncturing.", "ESH. Your mom is an asshole for hounding you about the baby's name and for telling everyone after you told her not to. But you knew she was going to blab, and you set her up to be embarrassed when she did. I don't think you're as much of an asshole as she is, but you're not innocent either.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
