He just yells into his phone on speakerphone and thinks it's fine. Now, if I happen to be with him and he answers a call, I make sure to loudly inform the person on the other end that they are on speakerphone and I can hear both ends of the conversation.", "NTA, it's such a pet peeve of mine when people are unnecessarily on speaker phone or listen to videos without headphones. If you're not involved with the conversation then why should have to listen to it.", "NTA at all. Your mother is being extremely rude taking calls during meal times. Does the other family member realise that they are on speaker phone and their issue is being discussed in your hearing? Does he/she know its not a private conversation? If not, that's also very rude of your mother for not letting them know. I think putting in airpods is entirely justifiable-its maintaining the other person's privacy. If your mother is going to carry on like this, she can't accuse you of being rude for not wanting to listen.", "NTA, not one bit. That's an entirely appropriate reaction. It's not passive aggressive. It is fixing the problem, since she won't fix it on her end.", "Definitely NTA, it\u2019s bad enough that she wants to bring up that sort of conversation over the phone on a dinner table where people are EATING but you must also listen ? Controlling much ?", "NTA. I have sensory issues, but have two kids, two dogs, three cats, and a husband. I wear my noise cancelling headphones most of the time. If your environment is overwhelming and you're not able to escape, find a tool that helps. \n\nI literally have them on now and synced with my TV so I can enjoy the show without hearing my cat bathe himself because that noise is the equivalent to nails on a chalkboard for me \ud83e\udee0", "NTA\n\nLots of people don't want to discuss defecation at the dinner table. You're not unusual. Your mom is pretty rude for taking any kind of phonecall at the dinner table, let alone one on this subject.\n\nIf your mom doesn't want to put the phone by her head, she should get headphones so she can make calls without disturbing other people with her selfishness. Wired headphones with speakers are a thing, if she'd object to wireless in a headphone too.", "NTA\n\nNot only is your mom TA she's an entitled, gaslighting one at that.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut you could also make a game out of it and insert funny comments based on purposefully missunderstanding them.", "NTA\n\nMom has no respect for other people at the table, at this point she is simply on her own bubble.", "NTA.
