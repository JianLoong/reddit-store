Basically she gets up 2-5 times a night. Almost every single time she tells my husband and I that she wants us to physically tuck her back in. She shares a room with two of her three siblings (not ideal and will be changing)\n\nWhenever my husband gets up with her, the behavior gets more frequent. In my eyes this is because he goes all in. Doing things like singing to her, cuddling her, talking to her, instead of placing her back in bed and going back to sleep. She basically gets a ton of attention with him at night and it makes her get up more. I\u2019ve tried to explain this to him but he dismisses it, so I usually get up with her to try to curb the behavior by giving minimal feedback and just putting her back in bed. \n\nMy daughter came to me at almost 3 am and asked me to \u201ccover her back up\u201d I was admittedly short and irritated. I took her back to her room and told her she is a big enough girl to cover herself with blankets. We\u2019d practiced this and talked about it so it wasn\u2019t like I was expecting her to do it herself out of the blue. She refused. So I told her goodnight, She began full on screaming at the top of her lunges and crying. I tell her that I\u2019m going to count to three and she can either stop screaming or we can go downstairs. At this point she\u2019s woken her siblings and I\u2019m trying to contain the situation. I count to three she\u2019s screaming more. I lift her out of bed and lead her by the hand to the stairs. \n\nAt this point my husband is up. He tells me he can handle it. I tell him I\u2019m taking her downstairs to talk to her and to keep her from screaming where everyone sleeps. He tells me to stop. I tell him he\u2019s undermining me and to back off. \n\n He does step aside but follows me downstairs and is cooing to her the whole time and bringing her water. I repeat that I can handle it and to please leave us to talk. He refuses. \n\nI do manage to talk to my daughter, explain that she can\u2019t scream like that and that she needs to be a big girl and cover herself with her blankets at night. My husband hovers over my shoulder. I take her back to bed, she does cover herself up, and we leave the room.\n\n He immediately turns to me and tells me that I was abusing our daughter. That I can\u2019t convince him that what I was doing wasn\u2019t abuse. I try to explain but he ignores me and marches downstairs to the couch. I try to talk to him again and he just insists that I\u2019m abusing our daughter. I was admittedly short with her but besides leading her downstairs by the hand I did not touch her and I don\u2019t feel I was overly mean in trying to enforce her tucking herself in when she finds herself uncovered in the middle of the night. So, AITAH?\n\nTLDR my daughter wakes up multiple times a night. In trying to teach her to take care of her needs on her own I removed her from the room so she wouldn\u2019t wake up her siblings, my spouse is calling me abusive and mean.

Your husband was undermining you and that\u2019s absolutely not okay. However, it seems he has pretty strong views on how to handle this (and is clearly quite affected by her being upset, which in itself is not a bad thing but his response to you was bad), so I feel like you\u2019re going to need to sit down and calmly get on the same page with this. Right now your daughter has good cop/bad cop parents and she\u2019s quickly going to learn how to manipulate her dad at your expense.", ">He immediately turns to me and tells me that I was abusing our daughter.\n\nHe should be an Olympic long jumper with leaps like that. That's fucking wild. NTA.", "Sounds like you have actually have four children, & the one on the couch sleeping off his tantrum should stay there. NTA", "Info: Do you have any idea why she's regressed like this? I.e, has more attention been focused on the younger two recently for some reason like sickness or because one is a baby. If so, it's probably her way of trying to get attention she might not be getting otherwise.", "NTA but you\u2019re husband sure is. He really doesn\u2019t respect you and the abuse accusations are out of line. Does he coddle all kids like this or just the 7 year old?", "NTA, OP you're doing the right thing here. You've isolated the issue (being that she has a 9 month old sibling and wants attention). You hold you ground knowing that this behavior is unacceptable, and you don't let your partner guilt you into backing down from what you know is best for your daughter. Excellent work.", " NTA your husband needs to quit enabling this behavior. It\u2019s very disruptive! And 7 is plenty old enough to take care of their own needs at night.", "Hey, the great thing here is the solution is SO simple: your husband gets to deal with her EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. He wants to play coo-coo baby in the middle of the night, let him! Turn over and go back to sleep.  The sleep issues with your daughter will resolve in time. Sleep well, momma! NTA", "NAH.  There are very few AHs at 3 am -- only people at the end of their rope who are doing their best. \n\nYou and your husband have different parenting styles and different views on child development generally.  It sounds like he's more of an attachment parenting guy and you're more of a behaviorist.  He probably believes that she is in a normal stage of development, that she'll emerge from it when the stage is over and that, in the meantime, her needs should be validated and supported so that a secure attachment with her can continue to be maintained. You probably believe she has lost a skill, and needs to be retaught it, and that giving her attention when she should be sleeping is teaching her the wrong thing. \n\nKids have gotten through periods like this with all kinds of parenting styles.  I don't believe there is a right or wrong approach here. \n\nFor the sake of your own sanities, though, it would be good for you and your hubby to get on the same page.   The key to this is not seeing yourself as right and him as wrong. Try to view this as two people with legitimately different styles who need to come up with a common game plan for these situations so you don't have to think about what to do each time she wakes up.", "I think her regression will go away if she feels secure. Let her dad deal with her if you are too tired. Soon enough she will stop doing this.\n\nI have one that sometimes wakes up and \"feeling lonely\". She knows she can always come to us. And because of knowing this she doesn't come often. If I would have just told her she is old enough to tuck herself in, she would have fallen asleep sad and lonely instead of choosing for herself that she does not need to go to mom and dad. I don't want her to feel lonely. I want her to feel secure, and to make good choices.", "NTA, this is no abuse. Regardless, I would worry a lot if my 7yo regressed to infant's night sleep schedule and took her to the doctor. There are some mild herbal medicines that can help to calm down and have a better sleep. Other than that, let your husband deal with her every night. Either he'll get tired of this or she'll outgrow it.", "I mean, if I was awakened at 3am to my daughter screaming and my spouse angrily taking her downstairs and both behaviors are out of the ordinary, I'd be hovering to find out wtf was going on too.\n\nI get it. You're exhausted. You've got a ton of kids and at least one of them won't let you sleep through the night.\n\nSounds like your daughter needs more attention during the day or that she's having nightmares. I'd suggest the three of you taking some time during the day to talk. She's old enough to articulate how she's feeling and to be spoken to with respect. Remember, she's a child and the fact that she's getting up several times a night is not normal, but she's still actively reaching out to you for help. Don't push her away or punish her for that. Try to come up with a solution that involves her input, and both parents in a united front.\n\nIf your new attempts don't help, have her medically assessed by her primary doctor or even a sleep specialist. My brother would spend half the night pacing his bedroom because he physically couldn't sleep until he was prescribed medication. My other brother had night terrors for years. Sleep isn't always easy for kids even without any triggering life events. There might be something else going on that you aren't seeing yet because you're (understandably) too frustrated and exhausted.\n\nI genuinely wish all of you the best.", "NTA.  What you did was absolutely spot on, on all counts.  Let him enjoy the couch, make him work hard to get off of it.  And hold him to whatever he promises.", "Sleep regression is usually a term used with babies and toddlers.  Your daughter is clearly having sleep disturbances which are often caused by anxiety or a change in schedule.  Given the number of awakenings, I\u2019d lean more toward anxiety.  Other than a not-so-new baby, are there any other big changes in her life?  Regardless, I\u2019d recommend checking in with her pediatrician to rule out any underlying physical cause.\n\nYou and your husband clearly have different approaches to parenting: you\u2019re taking more of a behaviorist\u2019s approach and refer to your husband\u2019s parenting as \u201ccoddling\u201d.  It\u2019s possible to find a compromise such as telling your daughter, \u201cHop back into bed, pull up your covers, and I\u2019ll give you another kiss good night\u201d.  Smooth the covers, give her a kiss, tell her you love her and you hope she has a good sleep.  Being tucked in again seems to comfort her and make her feel safe.  Maybe that\u2019s what she needs right now.", "NTA. \n\nYour husband is seriously over-reacting. \n\nYou should however try to figure out why your daughter is waking up multiple times at night. Just putting her back / telling her to stay in bed is just symptom control.", "NTA but your husband sounds like a complete dick", "NTA. Not a parent but have experience wrangling difficult periods with kids(oldest sibling). You just have to keep putting them to bed, and letting them know it\u2019s sleep time, minimal interaction.\n\nYour husband though\u2026 Jesus he needs to understand the weight of that accusation, that\u2019s not something you just toss around nonchalantly. That\u2019s incredibly fucked up.", "NTA. Telling your 7-year-old to go back to bed is not abuse. 7-year-olds can cover themselves up. At that age, tucking them in is not a physical need but a pleasant bedtime ritual\u2014a way of showing love and ending the day on a happy note. Your daughter\u2019s behavior does seem to be attention-seeking to me, and your husband is infantilizing her. As you wrote, she\u2019s getting positive reinforcement from your husband. But I\u2019m not a doctor or a therapist. You should probably check with them if this behavior is ongoing. \n\nInfo: does your daughter get one-on-one time with you and/or your husband during the day? Since she has two siblings, it may not be easy, and it\u2019s the alone time she craves\u2014just a thought.", "NTA I would have taken the same approach as you. You are correct that lavishing attention is more likely to encourage the wake ups (especially when she is \u2018competing\u2019 for attention with other siblings during the day)", "NTA\n\nYour husband jumped to abuse really fast. Idk if that is a manipulation or something he is genuinely worried about due to his past? Maybe he should see a therapist. \n\nGet your daughter checked out by her doctor\u2026 iron, b12, the whole gamet.", "I don\u2019t like when parents lift their kids or move them. I think they should do it on their own free will. I just dislike the thought of putting my hands on my child and physically forcing them to move. \n\nHaving said that, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re in the wrong for wanting to remove your daughter from the bedroom and having a talk. Your husband was completely undermining you and coddling your daughter. NTA n", "ESH\n\nYour husband is obviously way over the line with accusing you of abuse and undermining you.\n\nFor your part, your kid is regressing for a pretty standard reason. You won\u2019t spoil her forever if your husband spends some time with her in the middle of the night just doing normal caretaking tasks. He\u2019s going to have the relationship he has with her on their own terms, not yours. Back off. You are also someone undermining *his parenting.* Getting woken in the middle of the night is par for the course with choosing to have kids.", "NTA\n\nI told my daughter if she was continually waking me up at night, I get grouchy. So she either can have fun mum, and that means climbing in my bed and let me sleep quitely, or she can have grumpy mum, that means I will tuck her in her bed, but then be fully awake, and sleep deprived.\n\nShe got it. She was 3.\n\nFor fucks sake, you guys have to stop coddling her. She can totally sleep in her own bed, and she doesn't need you at night.\n\nBut it's not that easy sometimes. So what can you do?\n\nSleep separated from your husband, and tell both he will deal with it alone.

It was enough to cause her to become highly distressed... at which point you \"lift her out of bed and lead her by the hand down the stairs\"... are you sure that it was done as gently as that and you didnt yank her angrily and drag her? You're sleep deprived, already highly irritated and resentful towards this child's behaviour, so perhaps it was rougher and more frightening for her than what you describe...\n\nYes, your husband is the soft-touch, the more patient and compassionate one in this situation... and he is stating that the way you were behaving was abusive.

Basically she gets up 2-5 times a night. Almost every single time she tells my husband and I that she wants us to physically tuck her back in. She shares a room with her two siblings (not ideal and will be changing)\n\nWhenever my husband gets up with her, the behavior gets more frequent. In my eyes this is because he goes all in. Doing things like singing to her, cuddling her, talking to her, instead of placing her back in bed and going back to sleep. She basically gets a ton of attention with him at night and it makes her get up more. I\u2019ve tried to explain this to him but he dismisses it, so I usually get up with her to try to curb the behavior by giving minimal feedback and just putting her back in bed. \n\nMy daughter came to me at almost 3 am and asked me to \u201ccover her back up\u201d I was admittedly short and irritated.

I tell him I\u2019m taking her downstairs to talk to her and to keep her from screaming where everyone sleeps. He tells me to stop. I tell him he\u2019s undermining me and to back off. \n\n He does step aside but follows me downstairs and is cooing to her the whole time and bringing her water. I repeat that I can handle it and to please leave us to talk. He refuses. \n\nI do manage to talk to my daughter, explain that she can\u2019t scream like that and that she needs to be a big girl and cover herself with her blankets at night. My husband hovers over my shoulder. I take her back to bed, she does cover herself up, and we leave the room.\n\n He immediately turns to me and tells me that I was abusing our daughter. That I can\u2019t convince him that what I was doing wasn\u2019t abuse. I try to explain but he ignores me and marches downstairs to the couch. I try to talk to him again and he just insists that I\u2019m abusing our daughter. I was admittedly short with her but besides leading her downstairs by the hand I did not touch her and I don\u2019t feel I was overly mean in trying to enforce her tucking herself in when she finds herself uncovered in the middle of the night.
