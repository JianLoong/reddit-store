A \u201coh hell yes.\u201d I only eat breakfast foods for dinner, or the occasional brunch to soak up bottomless mimosas. My husband loves breakfast foods but doesn\u2019t eat anything before lunchtime because he\u2019s not hungry, just wants caffeine.

Okay so obviously I have watched several episodes of this show \n\n\nAnd before the invention of cereal there as never really a thing called breakfast food. Most of the time it would be left overs. Then we had the industrial revolution that changed things. Kellog originally invented the product, Post stole the idea for him.  Post was a patient at the Kellogg's brother sanitarium. And that is where Kellog came up the cereal.  Then it burned down and  Post decided he was going to try to make his own version. And Kellog was also trying to make and market his. There was all this drama and competition between them. \n\nSo there is an officially history and legit argument  that there hasn't always been \"breakfast\" food. \n\nSo please feel free to eat whatever you want for breakfast , even without the history of breakfast food \ud83e\udd23", "Fresh food AND you paid for her to get home?
