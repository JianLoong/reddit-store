My husband loves his nephews, up until last year, he ran a daycare and we plan on having kids soon. He loves kids and has treated my nephews since he met them 3 years ago.\n\nOn the second day of the trip, we were looking to explore Lisbon, and got up early. Emerson got up the earliest and used the bathroom first. Emerson also has a skincare routine, he uses quite a few products, stuff like creams and facial masks. He said he started doing it after he asked his baseball coach for advice on how to impress girls.\n\nHis baseball coach is a nice guy, in his 20s and married to a guy who I\u2019m close friends with. Emerson and his friends seem to view him very highly, a cool, young teacher. I\u2019ve talked to his coach and he says Emerson and the other boys often ask for advice.\n\nIrvin needed to use the bathroom to brush his teeth, Emerson was in there and doing his skincare routine, when he opened the door to let Irvin in, he made a comment about it being \u201cgay\u201d and called him \u201czesty\u201d, which Emerson told us is Gen Z slang for gay/feminine boys.\n\nEmerson and Irvin kept arguing over this, with Emerson calling Irvin stupid, and Irvin kept using homophobic language and called his brother a f slur, which then we separated the kids and let Emerson use the bathroom alone.\n\nMy husband went to check on Emerson to see how he felt, he mentioned this was normal for Irvin and that Irvin watches TikTokers who are homophobic and sexist. My husband asked him if he was ok and Emerson said he was fine and mentioned that he\u2019s going on a date with a girl soon, so his routine must be working. \n\nI asked my sister about it and she said that \u201ckids will be kids\u201d and said that Irvin didn\u2019t do anything too serious. She said Irvin wasn\u2019t homophobic and that Irvin just has a dark sense of humor. She said that \u201cyou know I\u2019d love Emerson and Irvin no matter who they liked or what they wore\u201d. I asked her to make Irvin apologize to Emerson, she went up to him and asked him to but Irvin said that he was only telling the truth and said I was being too emotional. \n\nAfter that, I told her if that Irvin doesn\u2019t apologize to Emerson that they wouldn\u2019t be allowed to vacation with us again. \n\nAfter that, she tried making Irvin apologize, including bribing him with candy and promising to buy comic books and Pok\u00e9mon but he wouldn\u2019t budge.\n\nWe eventually went out and spend the day in Lisbon, when we got home, we called our parents and told them about our day, my sister talked about what had happened and they told me I should apologize for \u201ctaking Emerson\u2019s side\u201d and making it seem like I had a favorite nephew.

It\u2019s your vacation house. \n\nNext time though, be more clear with the kid: we don\u2019t talk that here. Your language is hurtful and unacceptable. You\u2019re a guest. If you\u2019d like to continue being welcome here, you can\u2019t name call, use slurs, or disparage gay people or any other group for that matter. So would you like to be respectful and complete your stay here or shall I tell your mom to pack your things when she wakes up?", "\"Irvin said that he was only telling the truth and said I was being too emotional.\" Oh cool, there's the misogyny that so often goes hand and hand to with homophobia. NTA at all. It is not acceptable to tolerate that kind of language, he should learn that it is not acceptable from someone at the very least.", "NTA.  Your view of parenting differs from your sister's.   This issue made you uncomfortable and your sister refuses to address it.  I wouldn't invite any of them on vacation again.  You want fun and relaxation on vacation.   You don't need the stress and drama of bad parenting and bad behavior.", "NTA Yes, kids will be kids, but kids will also be little AHs, and when they are, it's the responsibility of the parent to stop them. Those TikTokers he watches are shaping his beliefs, evidenced by the fact that he claimed he was \"only telling the truth.\" This is the a perfect example of the \"slippery slope\" adage.  \n\n\nAnd your parents saying you should apologize to the little AH is ridiculous. He's wrong. He should have been stopped. You tried to stop him. You don't allow crappy behavior just so that a kid won't misinterpret it as favoritism.", "NTA.  Using homophobic slurs as some indication of affection is not acceptable.  Teaching a male teenager that its ok is setting a child up for failure in the big boy world.  You did not take a side. You took a stand - each kid can behave appropriately or can stay home.  You are not obligated to host ill-mannered persons.", "NTA. Allowing him to view that content is helping him become a hateful human being.", "This isn't about Emerson.

Someone needs to make it clear ro Irwin that homophobia isn't acceptable. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Your parents and your sister are ridiculous. \"Boy will be boys\" is almost always an excuse to dismiss bad behavior. Obvi your sister is okay with this and only wanted him to apologize so she won't miss out on trips. I hope you follow through!\n\nSis needs to also monitor his social media usage. He's 10! And saying homophobic and sexist things (calling you emotional). The algorithms can be really terrible and his feed probably has a ton of this BS on it.", "NTA\n\nWTF why are they letting their young kid watch homophobic or sexist tiktok videos?", "NTA and your sister is allowing a bigot to blossom under her nose. Allowing him to take in sexist and bigoted content is wildly irresponsible, and she is therefore encouraging this behavior, by allowing that to happen.", "NTA.\n\n\"kids will be kids\" turns into \"boys will be boys\" describing adult men.  Homophobic behavior like that needs to be shut down or he'll grow up to be a homophobic (and probably misogynistic as you described the TikToks he watches) adult.", "NTA. It\u2019s not taking a side, it\u2019s calling out behavior", "NTA. \nRegardless of his sexuality, keep advocating for Emerson and make sure that he knows you and your husband will always be safe adults for him to come to with anything.", "NTA\n\nWhat the fuck!? What Irivin did is unacceptable behaviour. It's parents like your sister who's kids eventually end up like losers.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to put up with that bad behavior on your vacation. Just explain it to your sister", "NTA and in this you should be taking sides because that behavior is not ok and doing nothing about it will only lead to more problems taking sides is occasionally needed like in this situation", "NTA - maybe it's me, but I would have went a bit farther than to have him apologize.  If he is allowed to talk that way (seems to be okay with mom), I can only imagine how he will bully those outside of his own home.  I can't stand it when parents who don't want to take the time to teach their children instead use the \"kids will be kids\" mantra to justify their laziness to parent.  I would have taken Emerson's side too!", "NTA\n\nNo sides to take. It's not favoritism to be against someone being verbally abused and harassed.  \n\nIt's a shame their parents have decided to make excuses instead of parenting.", "NTA- 10yo needs to learn that certain language is not tolerated . Since your sister has basically done nothing for awhile on that issue, the 10yo knows already he can get away with doing it.\n\nSupport Emerson is the right thing to do here, taking care of yourself isnt something that should be stigmatized.  It isnt taking sides, its showing you told tolerate nasty behavior.", "NTA you didn\u2019t parent her child, you informed her of what she should do and distanced yourself from it as a consequence of her not following through. Secondly, he needs to be stopped. At ten, kids are easily influenced and manipulated, his \u201cdark humor\u201d could turn into bigotry at any moment.", "Nope because like you said he was using homophobic language and you being a responsible adult you wanted to let him know now that language isn't cool to use", "Def. NTA. Irvin needs to be taught to take no for an answer and has to respect everyone and can't judge others without any basis. But, please try to handle this matter a little carefully it's a very sensitive topic and I don't think Irvin actually understands what it means and you (as in the family) should try and explain it to him why using slurs and calling people is wrong.", "NTA.  Irvin was awful to his brother, and he should be taught that homophobia is not ok under any circumstances. Also, your sister sounds like a horrible and enabling parent.  She was trying to bribe him with TREATS to apologize to his brother. It was basically saying she doesn't think he should apologize at all and was just doing it to appease you.  He should be punished not bribed.", "NTA and sounds like Irvin needs to have his social media privileges locked down hard!\n\n\u201cBoys will be boys\u201d is one thing since yes, brothers and siblings in general will go at it and name call, but once it crosses into slurs and watching degen TikTokers action is needed.", "Weirdest part about the story is the baseball couch telling a 13 year old to have a skincare routine to impress girls. Mad groomer behaviour. He's 13 and most of these products will be too harsh for his skin.", "ESH- It is tough to ask another parent to parent their kid. That is one of those lines that is tough to cross. They have their own system and, right or wrong, it is theirs. Threatening to not let Irvin come along because he is a bit of a shit at 10yrs old is a little too far. kids this age try on many different personas until they get a handle on who they are. Next month he may be super into submarines and calling everyone sailor. who knows.  \n\nIt sounds like you brought it up to your sister but then escalated again. saying something like- hey sis- this isn't right here you know. What do you think? And then leave it be.  \n\nYou sister is sucky as she is letting her kid be a poophead. Not good. so all around A H here!", "YTA for getting involved with the argument between them and confronting your sister. NTA for telling them they would no longer be welcome.
