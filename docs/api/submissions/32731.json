I then said that we could get a cat, a gerbil or whatever but I wasn\u2019t getting a dog.\n\nI then told him to tell the kids no because we weren\u2019t gonna get one.

Your distrust and dislike of dogs based on a bad experience aside, any pet, and dogs in particular, are a huge, expensive commitment.

Your husband tried to back upon into a corner. You never misrepresented how you felt about dogs. And he's not even considering the cost to your young family even if you were amenable.. My dog had a cyst that got infected, her treatment cleared it up, I was handed a $600 bill. I need to a family wedding out of state and no one could dog sit, the boarding fee was $500. \n\nYou are definitely NTA and shame on your husband for causing this predicament.", "Please do not try and suck it up for the kids sake.

He's positioning you to be the bad guy on a decision that shouldn't involve the kids anyway. You'll say no to him, so he's betting on you not saying no to the kids. That's a form of manipulation!\n\nThis should be you and your husband's decision and only involve the children once the decision is made. \n\nIf you had a phobia of snakes or birds or something else, would there have even been a discussion? Probably not. Phobias are nothing to mess with. How in the world are you supposed to be comfortable in your own home when you have something that gives you anxiety?\n\nHe needs to do the mature thing and apologize to his kids and explain to them that he made the mistake of making a promise he couldn't keep and then pretending it was your fault for him not being able to keep that promise. You don't make promises unless you are sure you can keep them.", "NTA but your husband is very manipulative", "NTA. I grew up with my mother having a severe phobia with dogs from an attack.

You are also NTA. My bad experience was working in pet retail for 7 years and being around dogs, dogs, dogs all day, every day. Day in, day out. Dogs and the people that keep them. Literally...LITERALLY THOUSANDS of them. It made me just never, ever want to live with a dog ever. I'm not mean to dogs. I helped people with dog problems all day. It was my job. \n\nBut it made me unable to stand dogs or their owners anymore. I've got stories from that place about dogs and their owners that would make you rage hard enough to want to do something illegal. \n\n>So as you can imagine, when me and my husband first met he told me about how he liked dogs and how he wanted one in the future. I immediately told him that I hated dogs so it was best if we ended the relationship and move on with our lives, but he insisted that he could live without dogs and it was fine.\n\nYou tried to do the right thing. You were honest with him from the jump and told him dogs weren't something you ever wanted. He told you he could accept this incompatibility and promised you he would forego owning a dog to be with you. Until he didn't. After 12 years and 2 kids. \n\n>Well he ended up telling them that we couldn\u2019t get a dog because I said no, so now I\u2019m seen as the bad guy and I\u2019m just so fed up. \n\nOf course he did. Because it served his purpose. Now he has the kids on his side to get them to help him guilt trip you into changing something you agreed upon years before.\n\n>But now I\u2019m seriously wondering if I should just suck it up for my kids sake and just get one? \n\nNo. You will not be able to just suck it up for your kids sake and deal with it. Here's why:\n\nYou can tell them as adamantly and as many times as you like that you will do exactly zero to take care of this dog you didn't want. It's 100% THEIR dog, THEIR responsibility. They all three will promise you to do ALL the training, cleaning, feeding, playing, exercise, everything themselves and you don't have to worry about anything. \n\nThat will last a few months at best. Just until it's out of the cute fuzzy tiny puppy stage. Then they'll start to slip. Your husband will suddenly become too busy to do much but come home after work and play with the dog for a little while. Your kids will have to go to school all day every day. They'll be too busy with that stuff to walk it, train it and clean up after it. They'll lose interest except to play with it for a little while each day. School and friends and games and phones will take more of their attention and time than the dog. \n\nThen all the dog's care falls on you, the person that didn't want it. You'll have a rambunctious young dog, no telling how big it will be, it's had haphazard training by your kids and husband who probably don't know how to properly train a puppy. What's it going to be doing that drives you nuts? Listening to it barking around the clock? Destroying everything it gets its mouth on? Peeing and crapping all over your house? Which you always get stuck cleaning up? Doing thousands of dollars worth of damage to your house and yard? Being aggressive to any or all of you? Trying to attack every other dog it sees or worse yet, your neighbors?\n\nOne or all of those things are possible. Then when you finally tell your husband the dog is basically another child you have to take care of that was forced on you, it's become too much, has too many or too annoying or too dangerous behavior problems...he gets mad and lays even heavier guilt trips on you. \"But the kids are attached to it!\" \"But Luna is such a great dog! I love her!\" \n\nOf course he loves her and so do the kids. He's at work all day and the kids are at school and they come home and play with her for an hour and that's all they know about it so of course they're thrilled to have a dog that you do all the hard, annoying, nasty and time consuming stuff for. \n\nDo you see how this is all about what he wants?\n\nI'm sorry. This is now going to become a source of strife in your marriage and your relationship with your kids. A dog is causing you problems already and it's not even there. \n\nIf you stand firm and keep saying no, he keeps chipping away at you while making your kids resent you. You say yes, he knows he can manipulate you and you wind up basing your whole life on the whims and demands of a dog. \n\nBut it's happening because he's making it happen. He's the one that changed back to what he always was. Someone who will put a dog over his wife, that he chose to marry, knowing that you never wanted a dog in your house and life.\n\nHe already made it abundantly clear that he will do that by making you look like the bad guy to your kids and he'll keep doing it. \n\nThis is why I absolutely will not date a dog owner, period. I've seen way too many of them act exactly as I described above and I just don't want that to be my life. It truly is a non negotiable deal breaker no matter what. \n\nAnyone else reading this and is in the same situation... don't ever fall for \"It's okay, I can go the rest of my life without ever getting another dog if you don't want one, babe\". It's a lie.", "NTA.\n\nYou don't like dogs. Your husband has known from the very beginning that you don't like dogs.

Either they won't get a dog and now it looks like it's all mom's fault (instead of something that mom AND DAD \\*agreed\\* to before the kids were even born) -- or they \\*will\\* get a dog because she feels pressured to do so, and mom will feel betrayed and resentful of her husband for the rest of their lives.\n\nYes, she's the reason, but it's also something \\*they\\* \\*agreed\\* to.

If he said \"yes thats true, sorry, but job makes money. Money feeds you.\" \n\nOr if his wife said, \"we can't go abroad because your dad is afraid of planes,\" the kids are allowed to be sad to be missing out because of dad's fear. I think it's important to know that it was the mums decision for them not to have dogs, but their kids should have empathy for that. \n\nYes, teams are important, but teamwork can work against you. Let's share the blame for everything, even though that's not authentic to the situation. The kids will soon enough know the dad did want a dog, and the mum is the reason why they don't have one. Then what? \n\nNow is the time for bartering, so maybe they can land on getting a cat instead. But there's no harm in asking after the kids bring up the idea. He shouldn't have to disarm any excitement the kids get because he knows the mum will say no. Then he's the bad guy? He's saying, \"we don't want a dog,\" even though he probably pets dogs when he's out and about or compliments his friends' pets? \n\nIt just won't add up, the kids will eventually figure it out.
