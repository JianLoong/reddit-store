Asking her to shower isn\u2019t a huge request, but I understand why she\u2019d be upset by it. \n\nI think you just need to talk with her about why you\u2019re so uncomfortable, how asking her to shower made her feel, and maybe go over the sterilizing precautions she takes at work if that would make you feel better.", "NTA.  My mother was a L&D nurse for almost 30 years and in hemodialysis for over 10........the FIRST thing she did was take a shower when she got home.  EVERY DAY SHE WORKED.

Your wife is a medical professional, not a magician that miraculously stays clean.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason they wear scrubs and wash them in hospital laundry daily.

Both the patient interactions and the hospital itself are both dirty, and your perspective is absolutely valid.\n\nPlenty of very normal people think a shower is appropriate before getting in bed even without working in a hospital setting.

Working in the medical field is intense enough that I'm a little weirded out that she doesn't even want to shower off her OWN sweat lol", "YTA- You're not being realistic. She washes if there's splatter on her skin.It's protocol. How many times do you shower daily. Do you touch your own forehead after putting hands on a railing or pushing an elevator button?

Especially someone in the medical field.", "YTA. Doctors have to be EXTREMELY clean at all times. If she did get anything on her, she cleaned it off at the first opportunity. I get that you're in your own head about it, but if she's actually walking around with that stuff on her, people would be dying. A shower isn't a huge ask normally, but I totally get not wanting to take those extra few minutes after what I'm sure is an exhausting day of being a doctor. And frankly, if all the precautions doctors take to keep clean didn't get whatever it is you think she has on her, a regular ass shower isn't either.", "NTA\n\nIf you were outside running from my place to another is disgusting not showering before bed.", "It\u2019s not an unreasonable request. Nor is it unreasonable to just sleep separately if that\u2019s what you prefer. At the end of the day if neither of you want to compromise, then just continue to sleep separately.

Are you 6'7 and she's 6'0 and there's not much room? If so, I'd upgrade the bed so there's more space, and then change the sheets every day. Personally, I'd be kinda bothered myself, but I wouldn't go that far to just sleep on the couch. If anything gets creative, suggest taking a shower together once in a while if there's space.

You don't know more about what will compromise your health and comfort than the actual doctor you're married to. She spent a lot of time training and practicing to do her job. She's more aware of the risks than you are. If she says she's safe to not shower, she's safe.

Any patient contact she has is gloved.
