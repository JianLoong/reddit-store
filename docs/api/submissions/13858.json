I think this may apply to you here.", "thats the most american response ever. you can do whatever you want to feel clean but daily showers are not very good for your health. its horrible for your skin, washes away all your natural oils and an exceptional waste of water. you\u2019re socialized to think anything but daily showers is gross. its not an objective truth.", "Absolutely.

She does, and I was wondering if the laws are different in my country. My Dad nearly died when he had covid last time, he is in his 80s with Parkinson's.

She\u2019s a very physically affectionate person so this was extremely unlike her but I heard the shower turn on and just figured I\u2019d give her some peace before bringing it up. As soon as she stepped out of the shower she came up to me and said \u201cSorry about that I was covered head to toe in amniotic fluid earlier.

My mother has super thin hair that gets oily very quickly so she has to wash her hair every day. Even though I have thicker hair that I only wash twice a week, it just never occurs to me to buy a shower cap. I just put my hair up in a grippy clip if I need to shower without washing my hair. Maybe I should get one though, it seems like it would probably be pretty useful. I use plastic grocery bags as a makeshift shower cap when I do hair masks.", "This^ - regardless of the gender of patients a doctor treats, I\u2019d expect the shower.

The result will be oily roots, hair loss, and dry ends. To help prevent this cycle, have healthier hair, and use less money on shampoo/conditioner try oil training your daughter's hair, start by washing her hair one day less a week, (so 6 days only at first) then after 2 weeks wash her hair one less day again (5 days of hair washing), repeat until she's only washing her hair 2/3 times a week. It may feel gross or uncomfortable at first so I recommend an updo on days the hair looks oily.  Eventually her scalp will recognize the natural oils aren't being stripped away and will become more regulated", "Just a side note, but washing hair more often makes it getting oily faster too. The skin produces more oil to compensate for what you strip off with shampoo every day. I understand every person is different and has different needs, and maybe your daughter does need frequent hair-washes for a reason, in that case, just disregard my comment. But just something to keep in mind, that maybe the routine is what makes her hair go oily so fast", "If her hair is tied back, unless she has a habit of headbutting her patients, it really shouldn't be a problem.

It took me a full year to get into the habit of showering after every shift. Im so glad I do now, I can't imagine not showering.

It's hard work working in a hospital and you often end up quite sweaty, especially if you're wearing PPE constantly", "That would make sense!
