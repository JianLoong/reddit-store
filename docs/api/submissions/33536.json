Family vacation be damned, I will sacrifice family time to be with her any day.", "Personally, spending an unnecessary extra few hours in an *airport* after a trip sounds like my personal hell. You had a five hour layover, y'all couldn't leave and come back?", "NTA, assuming you just asked him and didn\u2019t throw a fit or anything. Him calling you selfish for even asking that seems really over the top.

You wouldnt need to check you luggage (if you had any) at most if you would have needed to have your carry on checked again (if there weren\u2019t lockers to put it in) when going thru the checkpoint. -even if he didn\u2019t wanna bring you back you could have gotten a taxi or an Uber to get back", "NAH. I understand your sentiment from a LDR perspective but hanging out at an airport for 5 hours sounds like ass. So I understand him saying nah.

Go grab some lunch/drinks maybe smash one out.  Spending tims in an airport is boring but you guys had plenty of time", "Omg. What is wrong with everyone? The airport is not a fun place. This is true. But your supposed loved one has to wait for FIVE hours. And you can\u2019t figure out a solution beyond fuck you I\u2019m leaving you here and going home with my parents.

No matter how much I loved someone, it would be miserable to be confined in the small space, stuck with only terrible food options that are overpriced, and unable to decently shower or otherwise relax.

You\u2019d be all checked in so it would just be security. \n\nThis is tough because I don\u2019t think you\u2019re quite TA for asking but I do find it to be an off putting ask.

After meeting my (now) wife, after a long separation in a LDR, and after finally getting two months together, I flew with her out of my local airport on her first short sector to the big airport hub where she was to board her long-haul flight home.

Saw her onto her plane to Fuzzywuzzyland then I just flew home. \n\nShe did the same with me when I went to her country.

I don\u2019t think you were selfish. His reasons weren\u2019t valid. You already crashed his family vacation. If family time was so important for him, he could have gone on the family vacation with his own family without extending the invite to you. It\u2019s not wrong to want to spend more time with a partner who lives elsewhere. You flew in to his hometown for the layover back home. If he can\u2019t spend 5h with you esp when you are long distance, don\u2019t go on vacation with him again and just make him come to you every single time after.

Relationships work when you prioritize quality time with your partner. You would\u2019ve done it for him, right? This is a sign that you\u2019re going to be putting a lot more effort into this relationship than he is for the rest of the time it lasts. \n\nYou deserve to feel valued, and I can see how his response to you would hurt.

If he were, he\u2019d be happy to spend some extra time chatting at one of the restaurant, or on a seat in the waiting area etc. and even if he was tired, he\u2019d understand that you were tired too and would keep you company. At the very least, he\u2019s being selfish. \n\nMy husband and I were long distance when we first started dating. For two years, we were five hours apart. We\u2019d take every minute we could get - whether it was at a bus stop, airport, - you name it! 30 years later, we are temporarily long distance again due to a contract and once again - we are together in airport layovers etc.", "NTA. I spent 45 minutes in an uber, each way, to get to an airport to spend an hour with a friend I haven't seen for 30 years because they had a layover in a town near where I live. If someone values you they will make an effort to spend time with you when there is an opportunity.", "NTA, you asked a question, and he said no. BF was a bit dramatic, but if this was after a long flight, I understand wanting to get out of the airport. As for the people who say you could have gone to BF house: a) he didn't offer, b) airport security sucks, I wouldn't want to go through an extra time, c) leaving, travel home, travel back, security, and travel to gate while not cutting close would only leave behind maybe 3 hours (assuming it's a larger airport), which might not be worth it.", "So these are what we call big red flags.  And I hope you are seeing them.  I don't think I would continue seeing someone who thought so little of me that even the request of just sharing time together was received poorly.   \n\n\nIf my GF lived 8 hours away and I barely got any time with her I would have done anything to spend more time with her.  She wouldn't need to ask. And if she had to ask and I said no.

You can get apps that sell them pretty cheap (I paid \u00a330 last time, depends on the lounge though). You get access to the facilities & usually snacks, too. I could see that being more comfortable to spend hours in than in the general busy part of the airport. They tend to be closer to the gates, too and just generally less stressful.\n\nNAH", "He lived 20 minutes away and wanted to spend time with his family. SHES the asshole", "It\u2019s 20 minutes. If she plans right she can do it", "It seems as if it escalated a bit further than her just \"asking\" since it got to this point. I'm guessing OP didn't really want to take no for an answer and kept pressing.", "If it was just she asks and says no, ok fine.  But OP isn't really being fully forthcoming about this.  \n\nFurther down in the comments she makes a reference to getting upset and walking away for 30 minutes.  Come on, you really think all this blew up to be something this big from just \"asking\" and then accepting it when he says no?\n\nOr does this look a lot more like a situation where it is pressed, pressed and pressed some more until it turns into a fight?", "You shouldn't have had to ask. Which makes BF TAH. You have no where else to go. He should've offered to chill for a couple hours, instead of leave you in the airport.", "Good for you, hope you feel happier now.", "That\u2019s what a phone is for, you should know that if you are long distance", "That's what he said?", "And sometime you just do the right thing at the right time for the right person.", "I was exhausted too", "They live eight hours from each other and almost never see each other in person. Airports have food courts, gift shops, magazine stands, restaurants. Like another commenter said, it's clear that he doesn't like her as much as she likes him. True love this is not. Time to end it.", "I don't understand it. How was it a 5h layover if you stayed with them a week?", "7 months", "It\u2019s not always easy to get from an airport to your house.  Riding with the group is normal.", "I like exploring the common areas when I have time to kill. Just walking slowly through the retail spaces and checking out the weird lounge zones. Sometimes there\u2019s a lot of weirdness(eg;Denver airport) sometimes, the mundanity is interesting in itself. I like the people watching, I like checking out weird regional retail spaces and looking at overpriced tchotchkes. The point is that it\u2019s easy to generate fun when you\u2019re with someone you love and that it\u2019s good to stay curious. Boredom is not a reflection of your environment but of your own attitude about your environment.", "Yeah I walked away before it became a dramatic fight. I felt myself getting upset to I walked away to clear my head and take a shower bc I smelled like ass", "It was checked under his dads name not mine because I didn\u2019t get a free bag check and he had an extra.", "it has taken me two hours to get through security on a random Tuesday in July before in a less busy airport", "It absolutely can.", "Yes", "If you're getting off an international flight and transferring to a domestic, you have to do that.  It's as annoying as it sounds.", "I've had to do this at the airport in Toronto when going domestic then international", "He has lounge access through his dads credit card..,,", "He LIVES with his family. He just doesn't sound like he's into her at all. HES the asshole.", "They were just on a family vacation with his parents and he lives with them. How much time does he need with his parents? \ud83d\udea9", "Honestly I feel relief, I think that means I did the right thing. Im still sad its over but hopeful to meet someone better.", "Right because thats totally the same as in person", "It\u2019s not?", "the right thing?  Like taking someone on vacation for a week?", "It was a layover for me, not him. He lived in the town where the layover was.", "Well, he sounds like a prima donna. Don't get too carried away with this guy.", "This isn't a real relationship, this is free sex for him when it's convenient. \n\nYour first mistake was the LDR to start with, but now that you've seen who he really is, don't make another mistake by wasting one more minute on this guy.\n\nDump him, and put your energy into finding someone local.", "Look, LDR is hard, believe me I know. My parents spent 3 years in an LDR back in the early 80s, before the modern internet and cell phones. They kept in touch via landline phone calls and hand written letters, and the occasional visit when they had the time and money for a plane ticket. They've been married for over 45 years. But, it's been 7mo and he won't even keep you company for at least an hr in the airport. That being said, you also admit to storming off, which is manipulative, and not a good sign either. I don't think you're an ah for wanting more time with him, but, it might be time to figure if this is what you really want.", "that's healthy, good for you recognizing it and redirecting to cool off.", "Ok, but that doesn't jive too well with you trying to play this as you just asked and took no as an answer. Now  you were really upset, on the verge of a dramatic fight and you walk away for 30 minutes??? \n\nWhile he is still waiting around in the airport??", "Maybe that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t want to hang out more.", "So you were already leaving security and would have to go back through anyways?\n\nDefinitely should have just left the airport entirely for a couple hours", "Ah. You should edit your story to include that detail. The point being you wanting/hoping to maximize your time together.", "This is critical information. Your post makes it sound like you'd be taking away limited time with his parents who he doesn't see and is only seeing now on this special vacation. If they live together, NTA. If he didn't want to stay at the airport with you, you both could have gone to his place though. That's weird that he didn't offer and you didn't ask.  \n\n\nI don't think he's an AH necessarily, but you might not be that important to him tbh.", "Yes. We flew back to the US, then my connecting flight was a fairly short flight across the state.", "So you wanted him for his lounge access that makes more sense now", "Even the fancier travel cards that provide lounge access are usually only for the day you have a departing ticket from that airport, so he probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to get you access to the lounge anyway. \n\nI\u2019m confused about why you had his dad check your luggage if you were going to have to pay to check it anyway, it\u2019s the same fee to go from A to C as it is from B to C.", "As much as he wants", "It'll be hard not to, he's a selfish little shit.", "I mean unless you are the couple doing intense PDA in the airport it\u2019s pretty similar", "Oh you're right, my bad.", "OP doesn't mention who took who or if anyone took anyone but yea its the right thing to do. Its called being a gentlemen.", "Ah so his hometown. Not his parents.\n\nThen why didn't you go home with him for a couple of hours?", "This person is not being manipulative for being upset their bf wouldn\u2019t give them the time of day, come on. And \u201cStorming off\u201d isn\u2019t necessarily manipulative either.. sometimes walking away from an conversation is the best thing to do, especially if it\u2019s getting heated?", "I didn\u2019t storm off, I felt that I was getting upset so I walked away before it became a big dramatic thing.", "Thanks, everyone else absolutely hated that I did that lol", "Im confused ab your question. The conversation happened the day before we flew out.", "We both smelled like ass, we were gross from being outside in 90 degree weather all day", "Yeah, thats what ended up happening", "What? No? Thats a little rude", "Give me a break.", "I would have to pay the fee again. It was also an international flight connecting to a domestic flight. This requires picking up and rechecking.", "Tell me you haven\u2019t been in a relationship without telling you haven\u2019t been in a relationship", "oh you're one of those who lecture other people about being a \"gentleman\".  Good luck with that crap.", "He lives with his parents.", "That's a fair point, actually. Sometimes you just a need a little space to cool down. But I am still kinda bothered the bf wouldn't spend an extra hr or two with her. I get the airport isn't everyone's favorite place, but in a relationship, I just feel time together is precious. I don't think he had to do the whole 5hrs, even just one or two hrs would have meant a lot. My wife and I once had a 4hr layover in Heathrow. We hung at Tiffanys for a bit. Had lunch and cocktails at the Gordon Ramsey restaurant and enjoyed the view. It's one of my favorite airport memories, because it was just my wife and I having time together.", "I went to take a shower", "I dated him for 7 months just to get his lounge access at that exact moment\u2026 ok buddy", "At the airport? \ud83d\ude02 your story gets better and better with each retelling.", "No, the conversation happened the day before our flight.", "I took a shower at the hotel", "Ah, overly dramatic and an unreliable narrator. Great."]}
