It involves my husband's sister Lisa (31F).  We have never been too close because she is ultra Christian and I'm an atheist but things were never too bad between us until my wedding night.\r  \n\r  \nThe ceremony went perfectly but during the reception, my now sister-in-law kept making passive-aggressive comments to me about the wedding. She was complaining about the food, the music, the venue, and the decorations, and it was really starting to get under my skin. I tried to brush it off and focus on enjoying my special day.  I figured she was just in a foul mood since she was recently divorced, but she just wouldn't stop.  I even asked my husband to talk to her about it but he said it wasn't a big deal and I was overreacting.\r  \n\r  \nThen, during our first dance, Lisa came up and grabbed the microphone from the DJ and started giving a speech about how she and my husband used to be so close and how much she misses him and how much he changed since meeting me.  How lonely she is now.  She was laying it on thick like she was mourning my husband or something.  I have to admit, at this point I saw red. It was so inappropriate and disrespectful and it felt like she was trying to make the wedding about her instead of us.\r  \n\r  \nI confronted her after the speech and told her that she was being disrespectful and that she needed to stop it. We got into a heated argument and it was really uncomfortable for everyone around us.  Afterwards she stormed off and we didn't really see her again for the rest of the night.\r  \n\r  \nAfter the wedding, my husband's family was upset with me for causing drama and ruining the mood of the reception. They think that I should have just let it go and not confronted Lisa about her behavior. I feel like I was justified in standing up for myself and my husband on our special day.  The mood was already ruined with her awkward speech interrupting my husband and I's first dance together.  My sister in law wont talk to me and my mother in law has been repeatedly calling me and demanding I apologize.  My husband has not really been helpful either.  He hates any kind of conflict especially with his mother.  My own family is on my side.\r  \n\r  \nSo, am I the asshole for causing drama with my sister-in-law at my wedding? Should I have just let it go and not said anything?", "created_utc": 1684079046, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13hfi3k/aita_for_standing_up_for_myself_on_my_wedding_day/", "score": 1404, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How can he think this was ok", "NTA, but your confrontation-averse husband, enabling inlaws, and bizarre SIL are the real assholes here. She sounds unhinged; if I'd been a friend of hers I would have been helping her set down the microphone and take her somewhere to cool off. And no, when someone is basically saying that your marrying her brother is destroying their relationship, that person doesn't need accommodating-- that person needs therapy.", "NTA. Do **not** apologise for this.\n\nYour husband needs to back you up.", "NTA, but you are in for an interesting marriage if your husband is so conflict averse that he won't shame his sister for doing something so ridiculous during YOUR FIRST DANCE.  Holy shit.", "Welcome to the rest of your life. A bitter sister-in-law,  an interfering mother-in-law, a weak husband who doesn't have your back. \n\n\nIs there any way to have this annulled since its only been 7/8 days since you got married?\n\n\nNTA, although why no one stopped her speech is beyond me. But I really question your judgement in marrying into this family in the first place. Surely there were warning signs that your in-laws were going to cause problems and that your now husband doesn't stand up to them?", "Hell no! NTA. You are absolutely right about her ruining the mood with her speech.", "I hate families that enable bad behavior! NTA You have a real problem with your husband though.", "NTA - I'd say  you handled it pretty well... you showed restraint, in my opinion.", "NTA. Not even close. Your SIL and the people who support her most definitely get the prize for that.\n\nBest wishes for your future! And on to your problem: Is your SIL a person who gets passive aggressive and snide when she feels jealous that someone else is getting the lion's share of attention? Or is she just a negative and nasty person sometimes?\n\nThe divorce certainly isn't making her gentle, patient, kind and cooperative?\n\nBut grabbing the microphone from the DJ and going on an extended vent is absolutely unforgiveable. I'd give her a wide berth and stop speaking to your husband about it. (He may feel that his love, respect, affection and loyalty to his sister is being sorely tested? And frankly, continuing to bring this up might be isolating him? He's wrong. But, right now likely isn't a good time to force that on him?) *I'd let him off the hook because he'll come to see this isn't you being a jerk. Its his sister.*\n\nYou confronted her. You were in the right. And anyone who wants to convince you that you are the shrew in this scenario can get stuffed. No one gets a do over in this life. Not Lisa and not you. And you at least have done nothing to call a Mulligan over.\n\nMy SILs (identical twins.) behave poorly at least once a year. Somehow they feel marginalized in my marriage and think their brother has been stolen from them by me. The fact that I have been married for more than 20 years makes no impression on them. It becomes brand new again every time one of them gets a wild hair up their cracks.

Don't let it go as you can always blame her for ruining your special day.", "You need to brace your husband and tell him there will be another divorce in the family very soon if he does not man up and have your back.\n\nHe should be demanding apologies from his family.

Especially if kids are involved.\n\nGood luck!", "Definitely NTA, your wedding is your and your husband's special day, and even tho you and your sister in law had some differences, she was super disrespectful by bringing it up in front of everyone, especially in a manner that would make her look victimized, therefore trying to make everyone focused at her.", "Ideally your friend or family member should have taken the microphone gently from Lisa and said, How about a toast to the happy couple!, or something like that. Then they could have kept on eye on her to save you. \n\nThat didn\u2019t happen and you lost your temper, which is not great but is understandable. At this point you owe no apologies to anyone. I hope your husband can try to understand how you felt.", "NTA. Your husband needs to grow a spine. And your SIL needs to f\\*ck right the hell off with the rest of your in laws. She outright ruined your reception with her pity party. And then played the victim after being called out. And I find it really creepy that SIL is trying to \"husbandnize\" your husband. As if she thinks he should be with her instead of you. Do not apologize. You weren't the one in the wrong.", "Your husband needs to be very clear on two things here\n\n1. Whose side he is on\n\n2. How much he will lose if he continues to be spineless\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for how this shit went down. No, you should not have kept quiet, you should have confronted her (I say this as someone who hates confrontation). Your wedding was NOT the place for her to deal with her issues. It\u2019s not a therapy session, it was your wedding, FFS. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA - but OP - please make sure this is communicated to you husband as the deal-breaker it is.", "Jesus, is it too late to get the marriage annulled. Seriously, why in the world would you choose to do life with someone who won\u2019t stand up for you, especially to his own family? You are supposed to protect each other from any toxicity from your own families. \n\nDo you want a lifetime of this? Do you want to be with a man who is fine to watch you be disrespected and won\u2019t stand up for you? Do you want to raise kids (if you guys want that) with his family walking all over you and him doing absolutely nothing about it? \n\nWhy did you center this post on the sister and I told the actual asshole?", "I think NTA, but even though i dont know what it is there may have been a better way to deal with it. Worrying that your new husband doesnt seem to think his sister doing her speech was an issue. Sister(Lisa) is a huge AH through and through", "If it happened exactly how you said it has then I\u2019m flummoxed at the fact that anyone could defend your SIL. NTA.", "NTA She interrupted your first dance! WTF! Obviously his family must be used to her terrible behavior (she's probably always been able to get away with it) so they don't see how horrendous this is. You do not owe her an apology. She should have been escorted out of the venue for doing something soooo rude. I think you should seriously talk to your husband and explain to him that what she did was very disrespectful to you. Really, he should be able to support you here. But if he's too non-confrontational to stand up to his family, he should at least be able to recognize and acknowledge that this was wrong on his sister's part. Ignore the rest of his family.", "So NTA. I can\u2019t believe anyone would think you are! You\u2019re wedding how dare she do that the little comments bad enough but to then make a speech, I also feel it\u2019s  disappointing that MILis demanding you apologise and even more disappointing your husband isn\u2019t supporting you, tbh this doesn\u2019t bode well for the future. It\u2019s a bonus that SIL isn\u2019t talking to you.", "This whole story is wild. I am beyond shocked that she not only made a speech like that DURING YOUR FIRST DANCE, but also that no one stepped in to take the mic or mute her. I am baffled that anyone can defend her and that just shows that she has been enabled by her family. Anyone saying you should apologize \u201cto keep the peace\u201d or anything like that is crazy. Do not apologize. __SHE__ ruined the vibe of your wedding and owes __YOU__ an apology and your husband needs to stand up and support you to his family. Lisa also needs therapy. NTA", "NTA.  And honey your husband should have stopped that speech or addressed it.  You\u2019ve got a husband problem.  And just stop engaging with his mother.  you need to talk to your husband.  I personally would be so hurt and disappointed if my husband bailed on me like that.", "NTA\n\nThis will never change. Your husband didn\u2019t outright defend you and him on your special day. His mom and sister will always come first. Funny how he doesn\u2019t stand up to them but is basically standing up to you by doing nothing, which basically means he\u2019s ok with his mom and sister treating you like and shit and that you need to just accept it because he can\u2019t tell them they\u2019re wrong. \n\nHe will never put you first. \n\nGet an annulment, cheaper than divorce and child custody arrangements and further emotional damage later on.", "NTA  \n\nYou did not *CAUSE* drama.  \n\nYou stood your ground in the face of it.", "NTA. Your in-laws blaming you for causing drama says a lot about their family dynamic. Likely, SIL is used to getting away with her inappropriate behaviour due to the family never calling her out on it.\n\nInstead, they pressure the other person involved cause they know what SIL is like. A lot of families have someone they treat like that in my experience.\n\nDo not apologise. You did nothing g wrong. This lady actively tried to ruin your wedding due to her own failings.", "NTA. She misbehaved repeatedly at your wedding. You quite naturally got angry and confronted her as your husband wouldn't help. Not your fault. Anyway. Anyhow. \n\nI might point out that you have a bit of a husband problem as well as an SIL one. There is clearly going to be clashes between you and his family if he doesn't step in and defend you. I get that he doesn't like conflict and loves his mom but you have a right to demand that he stop thinking staying \"neutral\" is an option and remember that you are number one in his life now and he has to act accordingly.", "NTA\n\nYou married into a family of assholes.", "You\u2019ll have a lifetime to regret marrying into this AH family.

Why marry into this?", "NTA, but you need to take steps to ensure your husband grows a spine, especially if you plan on having children.\n\n\nHe can not hide behind the \"thats how they are\" rug sweeping mantra. Otherwise, your marriage will not last. \nHe needs therapy immediately with a professional who deals with emeshed families. \n\n\nThey are not your problem to deal with so block them all, if husband wants to visit he goes alone, they do not visit your home etc, you need to get your boundaries in place that save you being the target of their toxic behaviour, and stick to them, they are his immediate family, not yours. You should consider separate counselling and / or marriage counselling as their toxic behaviour will seep into your marriage and destroy it.", "If he was this non confrontational during the courtship there would have been no wedding day with him for me. His inability to set and enforce boundaries premaritally, was the precursor for how he would behave post nuptially.
