It involves my husband's sister Lisa (31F).  We have never been too close because she is ultra Christian and I'm an atheist but things were never too bad between us until my wedding night.\r  \n\r  \nThe ceremony went perfectly but during the reception, my now sister-in-law kept making passive-aggressive comments to me about the wedding. She was complaining about the food, the music, the venue, and the decorations, and it was really starting to get under my skin. I tried to brush it off and focus on enjoying my special day.  I figured she was just in a foul mood since she was recently divorced, but she just wouldn't stop.  I even asked my husband to talk to her about it but he said it wasn't a big deal and I was overreacting.\r  \n\r  \nThen, during our first dance, Lisa came up and grabbed the microphone from the DJ and started giving a speech about how she and my husband used to be so close and how much she misses him and how much he changed since meeting me.  How lonely she is now.  She was laying it on thick like she was mourning my husband or something.  I have to admit, at this point I saw red. It was so inappropriate and disrespectful and it felt like she was trying to make the wedding about her instead of us.\r  \n\r  \nI confronted her after the speech and told her that she was being disrespectful and that she needed to stop it. We got into a heated argument and it was really uncomfortable for everyone around us.  Afterwards she stormed off and we didn't really see her again for the rest of the night.\r  \n\r  \nAfter the wedding, my husband's family was upset with me for causing drama and ruining the mood of the reception. They think that I should have just let it go and not confronted Lisa about her behavior. I feel like I was justified in standing up for myself and my husband on our special day.  The mood was already ruined with her awkward speech interrupting my husband and I's first dance together.  My sister in law wont talk to me and my mother in law has been repeatedly calling me and demanding I apologize.  My husband has not really been helpful either.  He hates any kind of conflict especially with his mother.  My own family is on my side.\r  \n\r  \nSo, am I the asshole for causing drama with my sister-in-law at my wedding? Should I have just let it go and not said anything?", "created_utc": 1684079046, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13hfi3k/aita_for_standing_up_for_myself_on_my_wedding_day/", "score": 119, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She sounds unhinged; if I'd been a friend of hers I would have been helping her set down the microphone and take her somewhere to cool off.

Your SIL and the people who support her most definitely get the prize for that.\n\nBest wishes for your future! And on to your problem: Is your SIL a person who gets passive aggressive and snide when she feels jealous that someone else is getting the lion's share of attention? Or is she just a negative and nasty person sometimes?\n\nThe divorce certainly isn't making her gentle, patient, kind and cooperative?\n\nBut grabbing the microphone from the DJ and going on an extended vent is absolutely unforgiveable. I'd give her a wide berth and stop speaking to your husband about it. (He may feel that his love, respect, affection and loyalty to his sister is being sorely tested? And frankly, continuing to bring this up might be isolating him? He's wrong. But, right now likely isn't a good time to force that on him?) *I'd let him off the hook because he'll come to see this isn't you being a jerk. Its his sister.*\n\nYou confronted her. You were in the right. And anyone who wants to convince you that you are the shrew in this scenario can get stuffed. No one gets a do over in this life. Not Lisa and not you. And you at least have done nothing to call a Mulligan over.\n\nMy SILs (identical twins.) behave poorly at least once a year. Somehow they feel marginalized in my marriage and think their brother has been stolen from them by me. The fact that I have been married for more than 20 years makes no impression on them.

No, you should not have kept quiet, you should have confronted her (I say this as someone who hates confrontation). Your wedding was NOT the place for her to deal with her issues.

Seriously, why in the world would you choose to do life with someone who won\u2019t stand up for you, especially to his own family? You are supposed to protect each other from any toxicity from your own families. \n\nDo you want a lifetime of this? Do you want to be with a man who is fine to watch you be disrespected and won\u2019t stand up for you? Do you want to raise kids (if you guys want that) with his family walking all over you and him doing absolutely nothing about it? \n\nWhy did you center this post on the sister and I told the actual asshole?", "I think NTA, but even though i dont know what it is there may have been a better way to deal with it.

NTA.", "NTA She interrupted your first dance! WTF! Obviously his family must be used to her terrible behavior (she's probably always been able to get away with it) so they don't see how horrendous this is. You do not owe her an apology. She should have been escorted out of the venue for doing something soooo rude. I think you should seriously talk to your husband and explain to him that what she did was very disrespectful to you. Really, he should be able to support you here. But if he's too non-confrontational to stand up to his family, he should at least be able to recognize and acknowledge that this was wrong on his sister's part. Ignore the rest of his family.", "So NTA. I can\u2019t believe anyone would think you are! You\u2019re wedding how dare she do that the little comments bad enough but to then make a speech, I also feel it\u2019s  disappointing that MILis demanding you apologise and even more disappointing your husband isn\u2019t supporting you, tbh this doesn\u2019t bode well for the future. It\u2019s a bonus that SIL isn\u2019t talking to you.", "This whole story is wild. I am beyond shocked that she not only made a speech like that DURING YOUR FIRST DANCE, but also that no one stepped in to take the mic or mute her. I am baffled that anyone can defend her and that just shows that she has been enabled by her family. Anyone saying you should apologize \u201cto keep the peace\u201d or anything like that is crazy. Do not apologize. __SHE__ ruined the vibe of your wedding and owes __YOU__ an apology and your husband needs to stand up and support you to his family. Lisa also needs therapy. NTA", "NTA.  And honey your husband should have stopped that speech or addressed it.  You\u2019ve got a husband problem.  And just stop engaging with his mother.  you need to talk to your husband.  I personally would be so hurt and disappointed if my husband bailed on me like that.", "NTA\n\nThis will never change. Your husband didn\u2019t outright defend you and him on your special day.

Your in-laws blaming you for causing drama says a lot about their family dynamic. Likely, SIL is used to getting away with her inappropriate behaviour due to the family never calling her out on it.\n\nInstead, they pressure the other person involved cause they know what SIL is like. A lot of families have someone they treat like that in my experience.\n\nDo not apologise. You did nothing g wrong. This lady actively tried to ruin your wedding due to her own failings.", "NTA. She misbehaved repeatedly at your wedding. You quite naturally got angry and confronted her as your husband wouldn't help. Not your fault. Anyway. Anyhow. \n\nI might point out that you have a bit of a husband problem as well as an SIL one. There is clearly going to be clashes between you and his family if he doesn't step in and defend you. I get that he doesn't like conflict and loves his mom but you have a right to demand that he stop thinking staying \"neutral\" is an option and remember that you are number one in his life now and he has to act accordingly.", "NTA\n\nYou married into a family of assholes.", "You\u2019ll have a lifetime to regret marrying into this AH family.

Why marry into this?", "NTA, but you need to take steps to ensure your husband grows a spine, especially if you plan on having children.\n\n\nHe can not hide behind the \"thats how they are\" rug sweeping mantra. Otherwise, your marriage will not last. \nHe needs therapy immediately with a professional who deals with emeshed families. \n\n\nThey are not your problem to deal with so block them all, if husband wants to visit he goes alone, they do not visit your home etc, you need to get your boundaries in place that save you being the target of their toxic behaviour, and stick to them, they are his immediate family, not yours. You should consider separate counselling and / or marriage counselling as their toxic behaviour will seep into your marriage and destroy it.", "If he was this non confrontational during the courtship there would have been no wedding day with him for me.
