She has had a boyfriend the whole friendship up until 2 weeks ago. He was always nice to me and we got along, but we never hung out unless we were both with her. I was always the single friend.

They have broken up twice before (before I was friends with her) and this seemed like another in their pattern\u2014similar circumstances, etc. This past weekend I hung out with my guy once on Sunday before going to dinner plans with her. When she called and asked if I wanted to hang out earlier, I explained I couldn\u2019t because I was with my guy. She got mad and said how today was supposed to be our day. I said that it still was, he wasn\u2019t going to dinner with me and my friend but I wanted to spend a little time with him too. \n\nAll this week, she was guilting me over it and was distant. I didn\u2019t understand why she was mad so I did not go out of my way to spend extra time with her either outside of our typical calls and seeing each other at the house, many times she denied my calls but I figured she was still mad. We finally went to dinner tonight and I put a few hints together that she had been once again, seeing her ex. I asked since when they were a thing again and she said a week (a few days before Sunday\u2014when she went off on me) After talking more she said how every time she denied my call she was in his bed, and she had been with him almost every day this week. \n\nI really don\u2019t care about her seeing him (like I said, , but I\u2019m upset she hid it from me and let me go a week feeling bad about spending time with my guy when that is exactly what she was doing. We\u2019re both very lighthearted people but it really upset me and I asked for my portion of the check, paid, and left. \n\nShe is texting me saying to lighten up, but I haven\u2019t replied. AITA?\n\nEDITS TO ADD: both of the boys are M19. I didn\u2019t call my guy \u201cmy guy\u201d that in front of him not do I usually, just on here for privacy reasons. As I was leaving, she also said \u201cand don\u2019t tell ____ about this\u201d (my guy\u2019s name) \u201cthis is MY life, not his.\u201d I haven\u2019t told him since he has plans with friends, but I think I will eventually just because it\u2019s upsetting me and I want someone to talk to about it.

It sounds like you two are in a codependent relationship with no healthy boundaries. These kinds of friendships usually end with one person massively overstepping a boundary. Like, one of you fucking the other one\u2019s boyfriend or something of that nature. Do some research on setting healthy boundaries in friendships. If you need help, find a therapist.", "I was going to say exactly what the other poster said. You two are seriously codependent do it doesn\u2019t mean depending on each other. Please learn about it, your life will be so much easier if you stop these habits/behaviors. You both want to control or manipulate each other and you both feel less valued when you aren\u2019t causing the other person the behave the way you want them too. \n\nESH", "Absolutely!"]}
