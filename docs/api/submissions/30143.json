We were at my parents' house for a barbecue.

It seems like the actual situation is you\u2019re rude and she isn\u2019t.", "YTA.  You sound almost jealous here.  And your family is not impressed...with you.", "YTA. Laura obviously is that rare kind of human being who is able to put a positive spin on most things, if it weren't for AH such as yourself shooting them down all the time. Get over yourself.", "Of course YTA. And jealous of Laura.", "YTA. She's not fake. She's just not a nasty asshole like you are. You're clearly jealous of her because people like her. Maybe if you weren't so rude and nasty people would like you.", "Who wants to catch flies though?\n\n(Jk I agree)", "> \"You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar\"\n\nYou catch even more with bullshit. And that's what's coming out of Kate's mouth.", ">You may have heard of the saying, \"You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar\"?\n\n\"But if you pull their wings off, they'll eat whatever you give them\" - Kelly Bundy", "YTA - you sound salty that she has manners", "YTA; why are you so negative?", "YTA she tries to make the best of things and make people feel good. You sound like a really judgey asshole. Apologize and stop being rude to people who want to be nice.", "So she likes to see the good side of things, and you like to criticize.\n\nHmmmm, I wonder which of you...oh yes, YTA.", "YTA. It sounds like she is a generally happy, positive person. Why do you feel the need to put people down?\n\nI had an aunt that would find the positive in everything, got a flat tire. It\u2019s a way to make you slow down for a few minutes and take time for yourself. You added too much of someone a recipe, you were trying a new idea. I wish I could be that positive.", "YTA.\n\nI compliment people frequently, and it's literally just reflexive for me at this point. It was a strong part of my upbringing; stopping it would feel unnatural to me. And when someone's sad or might become sad (say if they'd made a small mistake like burning some food and someone was being unpleasant to them about it), I want them to feel better and so I find something to compliment-- because *I* find it unpleasant when people around me are upset. Do you really think it's so unreasonable to want the people around you to be happy?\n\nThis is also very much a gendered thing. Women are often raised with a great deal of pressure-- conscious or unconscious-- to put others' needs ahead of our own, to the point that we might forget *how* to do anything else. Your SIL has spent her entire life having her need to make others happy *reinforced constantly* by cultural forces from every angle, in social situations and family life and the workplace; and you will probably never be able to understand that unless you seek further education on the matter or spend time as a woman yourself. And now you have the gall to say, \"Hey, everything that everyone has told you you're meant to be, the life you learned from your loved ones and the self-image you've had since you were a child-- and the way YOU YOURSELF choose to be, the way that feels *natural* to you-- that's *fake*.\"\n\nSometimes people are just *nice* and *that's okay*, especially when we've been constantly TOLD to be nice!\n\nAlso some people just legit like burnt food. My grandma would always toast her toast to the point of it being unrecognizable; she always went for the end portions of a roast first because they were the most well-done. Whenever we accidentally burned something, she'd snap it up in a heartbeat. I got a bit of that from her, and love a bit of char.", "YTA - there's away to successfully call someone out on grating behavior, and it's not by using the word \"fake.\"  Also, I'm sure in her head she's not trying to be fake, she's trying to be accepted by the family.  It's fine if her habit annoys you, but that doesn't excuse your crass behavior.", "YTA I am just like Laura. I always put a positive spin on things and it is not fake. Just because it\u2019s not how you choose to behave doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t genuine. You were rude to both Laura and your Dad.", "YTA. Is your name Grinch?  I love when folk find something nice to say and are positive even when something has gone wrong - you obviously don\u2019t. You dad tried - it didn\u2019t work out but all you could do was slag him off while she tried to make the best of the situation. Your dad was probably embarrassed and you added to it while she attempted to find some good in his efforts.  I know who I would invite to the bbq. Your sister and mum are right.", "Yta", "YTA.  She was being freaking polite to the people that cooked for her.  It\u2019s called manners.  There are books out there you can read about how to use them.", "YTA, she was being nice, you were being an asshole", "Laura doesn't compliment \"horrible\" things, she simply chooses not to point out mistakes everyone is already aware of or humiliate the person who made a mistake. Everyone saw the barbeque was burned. Was there a need to harp on about the very obvious fact? Do you often point out too obvious things? YTA learn some manners.", "YTA. The compliment wasn't directed at you, it was for your dad, so you had no right to insert yourself into it. If the compliment had been for you and you felt it wasn't sincere you should have talked to her one on one about it instead of creating a scene and embarrassing her in front of your family.", "This one made me smile \ud83d\ude0a", "Yes indeed", "We do, to kill them.
