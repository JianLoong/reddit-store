{"id": 8760, "submission_id": "10pze1c", "title": "AITA for telling my late dad's ex girlfriend that I don't want her kids?", "selftext": "Backstory that explains some of this: My dad dated Anna on and off from the time I was 13. In their one extended off period (almost two years) she had a daughter and was pregnant with another daughter. They got back together while Anna was still pregnant and were back to their on and off relationship. For the most part they lived together through all the off parts of their relationship from the beginning. The only exception was the off part when they were apart for almost two years. It was rough living there when they weren't together. They brought other people back and were generally just toxic and had a shitty relationship. I moved out of dad's house and in with my grandparents when I was 17. It was a lot for me. I had never bonded or had any kind of love for Anna or her girls while I lived with them. I was just trying to survive the upheaval my dad was putting me through. I don't even remember how old the girls were when I last saw them. Pretty small though. A few times dad would tell me to be their big brother or whatever but he was more wrapped up in Anna. They broke up a few months before he died two years ago. He and I weren't really talking in the last year of his life.\n\nSo Anna has been diagnosed with some neurological disease and reached out to my grandparents to raise her girls. She has nobody. Doesn't know the bio fathers of the girls, doesn't have any family she's in touch with (she was deep in drugs and alcohol for years and they disowned her over it and were not interested in hearing from her again) and no friends left. My grandparents said no because they had nothing to do with the girls and had not considered them surrogate granddaughters. To be honest even before dad died I was the only person in his house they had a relationship with. They didn't see dad anymore because of how he was.\n\nNext up was me. She tracked me down on social media and told me she needed to talk about something important. She explained to me that she's sick, and I could see it in the way she was walking and talking, and she knows the girls are too young to survive when she gets worse and she wants better for them. She said after years of being their brother, and of living with them, she wanted me to take her girls and raise them and let them visit her but once she's gone, to be the family they don't have otherwise. I was shocked and even a little pissed if I'm honest because Anna was asking for something huge for me for people who were essentially strangers. We were never a family but she was acting like we had been at some point. She saw how I was reacting and said my dad would have wanted me to do this and to think about how I lost my mom and dad and how I should consider her girls. It pissed me off so much I told her I didn't want her kids and I walked away. She asked me how I could do this to her girls and called me a dick. She told me when they end up bounced around in foster care, I will only have myself to blame.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1675172626, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pze1c/aita_for_telling_my_late_dads_ex_girlfriend_that/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The reason I'm asking this question about being TA is because I know her kids are innocent and won't have anybody there for them when she gets too sick or dies from her disease.

If you don't want them and you don't want kids- how is that going to be good for these girls?\n\nIt sounds like Anna has made a lot of poor choices and has burned a lot of bridges. What is sad is that it seems her children are going to have to pay the price, and Anna has to watch them do it while she dies. It's absolutely tragic, but not your responsibility or problem. Anna lashed out because she knows what she did, and has been looking for someone to fix it.\n\nGood job OP staying strong. This was a hard one.", "N T A. Those girls are not related to you at all.

You have the right to refuse, especially if you're not prepared to be a parent to kids who will need the extra help dealing with losing their mother.", "NTA - She's desperate and acting badly. It will suck for these girls in foster care but that's not on you. They are basically strangers to you. She has no right to try and guilt you over mistakes she's made that have left her utterly alone.", "While the girls are completely innocent in all of this, do not let Anna guilt you - this is her (and your dad's) mess, not yours.

If this situation is a criticism of anyone, it's society in general, not you specifically (and of course Anna). She's not wrong to ask, but she is way out of line guilting you about your dad and calling you names.", "NTA at all! If you didn't make the kids they are in no way, shape or form your responsibility. Sounds like she knows the kids are bound for foster care, and wants to blame everyone else for the fact she's a terrible mother, and person.", "NTA. She tried to guilt you into it and you quite rightly said no. They are not your responsibility. If they're bounced around in foster care, and I sincerely hope they are not, it will be her fault for alienating her family and having no idea who their dads are.", "NTA\n\nYou're not obligated nor have a close relationship for her to even try the emotional manipulation.\n\nYes it sucks, but will probably be better for the kids long term to have a stable environment.", "NTA. You've done nothing to her girls and you're not a dick. She is. I have little sympathy for people who have children they can't or won't care for and then blame the world for what is their responsibility.\n\nYou're not the one who got impregnated by strangers, drunk alcohol or did drugs, nor are you the one who made her do it.\n\n>She explained to me that she's sick\n\nDid she provide you proof? Do you know what disease she has exactly and what the doctors say about it or what caused it? I wouldn't trust that woman to give me the time of day on her word alone.\n\nIf you ever feel guilty for not taking care of these children, you can always use that as an impetus to start charity work. There are many, many people in need of help and complete strangers are not less deserving of it than this vague acquaintance.", "NTA your not to blame nor are you responsible for anything that happens to her or the girls.", "Nta.  It was a very unfair ask of you. I'm sorry for her kidd but the only people to blame  for their situation is Anna and the kid's fathers. Good luck OP!", "NTA. You stated they arent even blood related to you. Maybe she should take the time to track down the families of these girls instead of trying to pawn them of on ya'll. It's a sad situation but do not feel guilty for saying no. That is a HUGE responsibility!!!", "Such a sad situation, OP.\n\nFirst, I'm sorry for the clusterfuck you grew up around. That sounds so stressful and awful and I'm so happy you were able to eventually move to your GPs'.\n\nSecondly, I'm sorry for the situation these kids have found themselves in, it's hard to lose a parent at any age, let alone (for all intents and purposes) be orphaned this young.\n\nAll that said, they aren't your responsibility. You may have or have had a loose brotherly relationship them, but that doesn't necessarily translate or shift to one of parenting. \n\nKnowing your caregiver isn't enough, they need to be loved.

Hopefully, she will be able to meet any perspective parents and be allowed to determine who will raise her girls.

It sucks she's burned all of her bridges. I feel bad for the children and yeah it'd be cool for someone to take them while she's I'll but that doesn't make any of you (you and your grandparents) responsible for them. It's tricky because her children don't and haven't deserved the hectic life she lead and made them lead but that doesn't mean that you are a bad person for not wanting to suddenly raise children that you don't know. Kids are a big responsibility and throw in you'd have to handle all of the emotional stuff that comes along with taking them to see her once a week. That's a lot to sign up for and I don't blame you for not wanting to take them.", "NTA    \n\nIt's a sad story to be sure but you are under zero obligation to sign up for 20+ YEARS of time, money, and emotional investment.   \n\nI do not blame her for trying, but NO.", "NTA\n\nNo doubt that this is a shitty situation, but it's not your shitty situation to have to handle. If those girls end up in foster care, it's sadly a result of her mother's choices with her interpersonal relationships. She knows she messed up royally and is taking it out on you.", "NTA, it's not like you grew up together and had a normal sibling relationship.", "NTA. I'm baffled as to why she thought you wanted more upheaval in your life. Her kids = her problem.", "NTA\n\nYou're never obligated to essentially become a parent to anyone else's kid(s).   \n\nI personally would, just because the foster care system is a fucking nightmare, but I definitely understand your position of \"No, I can't/won't and shouldn't have to\"", "NTA. It's a tough situation for those kids, but she's asking a lot of you and this isn't your responsibility.", "NTA- Don't bring toxic into your life and I'm sorry you have to deal with this drama but No you don't owe anyone anything!", "NTA, \n\nKids are not things to just sit around.

Also you didn't make these children...\n\nAnd foster care seems to be a hit and miss, it's not like their homeless or anything.\n\nAlways look out for projection when someone like her calls you selfish and a dick (she is selfish and a dick).

I feel terrible for those little girls and I hope they can find a forever home quickly, but they're not your responsibility at all.  As a father of 4 kids, I can tell you that it's a massive responsibility mentally, physically, and financially, and I wouldn't take it on if they weren't my kids and I had no attachment to them.  This a sad story all around, good luck", "NTA.\n\nIf I could offer advice to Reddit users before they have to post an AITA, I would say: never allow someone who means nothing to you but thinks he or she is a close relative to talk to you about anything.

Anna created all of her problems and you have no obligation to put your life on hold to fix her mistakes.", "NTA.  If you are doing alright for yourself and want to be magnanimous, you could offer to buy DNA tests for the kids to see if they can track down the dads.  Do note that foster care tends to end very badly for most kids, so those girls are likely doomed without someone to care for them ... but that is not your problem.  It is especially not your problem if you can't afford it and/or would resent it.", "NTA.  You are right.  These girls are a huge responsibility and will require a lot of support.  Please let go of the anger.  She is dying and desperate.", "NAH\n\nYou're definitely not obligated here to take these girls in morally or legally. That being said I can't fault her for trying. If I knew I was dying soon, I would reach out to literally anyone I trusted to see if they would take care of them so they didn't have to go into the system. Don't take the girls if you don't want, but also don't be too harsh on her, she's actually trying to be a good mother.", "NAH. She\u2019s stressed, and took a chance. Probably desperate.  If you\u2019re secretly wealthy or something, then maybe you\u2019d be ta.   But realistically\u2026. Who\u2019s to say you\u2019ll be a better parent than a foster parent \u2018just because\u2019?  How old are you, how financially secure, etc\u2026  not literally asking, just saying these are factors she should consider.", "[deleted]", "This will be against the grain but NAH. No one is behaving perfectly in the story but no individual sucks or is *the* person at fault. This is just an incredibly tragic situation. \n\nAnna is dying, and she\u2019s desperate. She shouldn\u2019t have emotionally manipulated you with her argument, but it\u2019s not difficult to see that this is probably her legitimate perspective due to the extreme duress she is under. \n\nYou have no obligation to take these girls in and are well within your rights to say no.

It should be someone you can trust to have their best interests at heart, who would be willing to take them in, preferably someone the kids have a good relationship with.

Don't feel guilty. You weren't even her first choice. I've known foster parents who were awesome people, better than I could ever hope to be.", "NTA.

She looked very sick and was struggling with speaking, walking and overall body movement. I would say she's been sick a while but had spent a lot of time hoping her family would come around.", "I'm not sure the fathers of the girls would even know they exist. I'm going to guess probably not given how she was back then.", "They're a big responsibility and I know from experience that grieving kids need someone who loves them, not someone who feels nothing for them, during that time. Someone who longs to help kids and who wants to be there for them will always be better. That's not me. From the time my own mom died and I got stuck with dad, I know not having that love or care is hell on a kid.", "So if they have wealth they don't want to be boisterous about, they'd be the AH?

If you mean my reaction to her asking, I might have contained myself better and just told her I couldn't do it without anger and walked away. The guilt trip really just... ugh.", "My anger comes from the fact we are strangers. Yes, we lived together and she was my dad's girlfriend but we didn't have some amazing relationship or even a decent one. She was more focused on getting laid and drinking for most of it. Her girls got some of that focus in the later stages but she and I are nothing and her girls and I are nothing and then she tries to get me to take them anyway.", "Sad but true.", "I get that her family won\u2019t want her to contact them.

Maybe they are willing to take the girls, when they hear what\u2019s going on. \n\nBut no, taking in these girls will be a huge responsibility. They\u2019ll have trauma from their parents passing (we assume your father had a parental role), and most likely also trauma because of their upbringing.

I was an adult when I lost my parents and that was so hard, going through it as a kid is mind boggling. Like you said they need someone who can help them and wants to help them. Knowing you're not capable is huge. You've been through a lot and you've learned some pretty good stuff from it. Sorry for the loss of your mom. I know it's been awhile but that pain doesn't go away.", "You don't need to take the girls. But Anna is looking for someone, anyone, to take the kids and keep them out of perpetual foster care. If that were all there was to it, think you might feel more sorrow at her situation than anger. \n\nBut thats not all thats happening. You are righteously angry that she and your dad tore your family apart.", "I\u2019m possibly being foolish but I don\u2019t see the cause for anger here. She is dying and she is leaving her daughters alone in this world - they\u2019re going to end up in the care of strangers either way. From her perspective it\u2019s better to try and place them with someone who knows them, and who she knows has a good head on their shoulders, rather than allowing them potentially to be separated or abused in the foster system (not that this is a fait accompli either, but it does happen and can\u2019t necessarily be controlled for.) \n\nYou don\u2019t have to say yes, of course, and her guilt trip is beyond the pale, but I don\u2019t think the request alone is worth getting worked up over.", "It's no different than a stranger on the street asking you to take their kids.\n\nOP is not related to the ex or her children. Not a single drop of blood is shared.\n\nThe audacity is pretty insane.", "Yeah that\u2019s kind of my point - I wouldn\u2019t be *angry* if a stranger on the street did that. \n\nDoesn\u2019t mean I\u2019d take their kids either, but I\u2019d just feel sorry for them and their situation and politely refuse.\n\nI\u2019m not really seeing the audacity either. If a friend or acquaintance asked me to do this despite not one drop of blood being shared I wouldn\u2019t find it audacious, I\u2019d probably be touched that they thought so much of me that they\u2019d trust me with their children. Again - it doesn\u2019t mean I would take the children (although I *personally* would but that\u2019s due to personal circumstances outside of this hypothetical) but I don\u2019t see why OP was instantly *angry* with the request alone. \n\nEdited to add emphasis."]}
