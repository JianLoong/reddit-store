{"id": 8760, "submission_id": "10pze1c", "title": "AITA for telling my late dad's ex girlfriend that I don't want her kids?", "selftext": "Backstory that explains some of this: My dad dated Anna on and off from the time I was 13. In their one extended off period (almost two years) she had a daughter and was pregnant with another daughter. They got back together while Anna was still pregnant and were back to their on and off relationship. For the most part they lived together through all the off parts of their relationship from the beginning. The only exception was the off part when they were apart for almost two years. It was rough living there when they weren't together. They brought other people back and were generally just toxic and had a shitty relationship. I moved out of dad's house and in with my grandparents when I was 17. It was a lot for me. I had never bonded or had any kind of love for Anna or her girls while I lived with them. I was just trying to survive the upheaval my dad was putting me through. I don't even remember how old the girls were when I last saw them. Pretty small though. A few times dad would tell me to be their big brother or whatever but he was more wrapped up in Anna. They broke up a few months before he died two years ago. He and I weren't really talking in the last year of his life.\n\nSo Anna has been diagnosed with some neurological disease and reached out to my grandparents to raise her girls. She has nobody. Doesn't know the bio fathers of the girls, doesn't have any family she's in touch with (she was deep in drugs and alcohol for years and they disowned her over it and were not interested in hearing from her again) and no friends left. My grandparents said no because they had nothing to do with the girls and had not considered them surrogate granddaughters. To be honest even before dad died I was the only person in his house they had a relationship with. They didn't see dad anymore because of how he was.\n\nNext up was me. She tracked me down on social media and told me she needed to talk about something important. She explained to me that she's sick, and I could see it in the way she was walking and talking, and she knows the girls are too young to survive when she gets worse and she wants better for them. She said after years of being their brother, and of living with them, she wanted me to take her girls and raise them and let them visit her but once she's gone, to be the family they don't have otherwise. I was shocked and even a little pissed if I'm honest because Anna was asking for something huge for me for people who were essentially strangers. We were never a family but she was acting like we had been at some point. She saw how I was reacting and said my dad would have wanted me to do this and to think about how I lost my mom and dad and how I should consider her girls. It pissed me off so much I told her I didn't want her kids and I walked away. She asked me how I could do this to her girls and called me a dick. She told me when they end up bounced around in foster care, I will only have myself to blame.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1675172626, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pze1c/aita_for_telling_my_late_dads_ex_girlfriend_that/", "score": 490, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What is sad is that it seems her children are going to have to pay the price, and Anna has to watch them do it while she dies. It's absolutely tragic, but not your responsibility or problem.

She's not wrong to ask, but she is way out of line guilting you about your dad and calling you names.", "NTA at all! If you didn't make the kids they are in no way, shape or form your responsibility. Sounds like she knows the kids are bound for foster care, and wants to blame everyone else for the fact she's a terrible mother, and person.", "NTA. She tried to guilt you into it and you quite rightly said no. They are not your responsibility.

That sounds so stressful and awful and I'm so happy you were able to eventually move to your GPs'.\n\nSecondly, I'm sorry for the situation these kids have found themselves in, it's hard to lose a parent at any age, let alone (for all intents and purposes) be orphaned this young.\n\nAll that said, they aren't your responsibility. You may have or have had a loose brotherly relationship them, but that doesn't necessarily translate or shift to one of parenting. \n\nKnowing your caregiver isn't enough, they need to be loved.

It's tricky because her children don't and haven't deserved the hectic life she lead and made them lead but that doesn't mean that you are a bad person for not wanting to suddenly raise children that you don't know.

I'm baffled as to why she thought you wanted more upheaval in your life. Her kids = her problem.", "NTA\n\nYou're never obligated to essentially become a parent to anyone else's kid(s).   \n\nI personally would, just because the foster care system is a fucking nightmare, but I definitely understand your position of \"No, I can't/won't and shouldn't have to\"", "NTA.

It should be someone you can trust to have their best interests at heart, who would be willing to take them in, preferably someone the kids have a good relationship with.

I'm going to guess probably not given how she was back then.", "They're a big responsibility and I know from experience that grieving kids need someone who loves them, not someone who feels nothing for them, during that time. Someone who longs to help kids and who wants to be there for them will always be better. That's not me.

You are righteously angry that she and your dad tore your family apart.", "I\u2019m possibly being foolish but I don\u2019t see the cause for anger here. She is dying and she is leaving her daughters alone in this world - they\u2019re going to end up in the care of strangers either way. From her perspective it\u2019s better to try and place them with someone who knows them, and who she knows has a good head on their shoulders, rather than allowing them potentially to be separated or abused in the foster system (not that this is a fait accompli either, but it does happen and can\u2019t necessarily be controlled for.) \n\nYou don\u2019t have to say yes, of course, and her guilt trip is beyond the pale, but I don\u2019t think the request alone is worth getting worked up over.", "It's no different than a stranger on the street asking you to take their kids.\n\nOP is not related to the ex or her children.

If a friend or acquaintance asked me to do this despite not one drop of blood being shared I wouldn\u2019t find it audacious, I\u2019d probably be touched that they thought so much of me that they\u2019d trust me with their children. Again - it doesn\u2019t mean I would take the children (although I *personally* would but that\u2019s due to personal circumstances outside of this hypothetical) but I don\u2019t see why OP was instantly *angry* with the request alone. \n\nEdited to add emphasis.", "NTA - EXCUUUUSE me! If they end up being bounced around foster care it will be on HER and her life long behaviors! NOT you! You didn't make those babies  exist. SHE did . .  and just because she was in some kind of toxic relationship with your dad . . . STILL doesn't put ANY responsibilities on you!

Foster care must allow for safe contact with extended family at times - that still sounds like a pain in the ass for you, but also an immeasurable comfort for the girls. I know the system is crazy and overstressed, but maybe there's some help available for people in you and the girls' situation. Bottom line, though, it's not your problem.", "NTA. You fled your home to be away from her and she had to track you down. These girls have no relation to you. \n\nI hope Anna's family steps up but you aren't responsible for all the relationships she's destroyed in the past that made her desperate enough to reach out to you.", "NTA- she is blame for the foster care situation. Anna should have planned her life better as far as procreation.  You are not at fault here.", "NTA- She\u2019s trying to make you feel guilty while also\ntaking her anger out on you.\n\nYou have no responsibility to them. It\u2019s unfortunate but that\u2019s life.", "i mean... obviously NTA... sounds like you're not too old yourself... so taking on the responsibility of two kids is way beyond anything you should do... it's of course heartbreaking for the little girls... but maybe the mother should use the time trying to find decent fostercare for her girls instead of talking to the kid of a dude she banged years ago....", "NTA - It sucks for the girls, truly, but the reality is, that you are not to blame.  Everyone who chooses to bring children into the world has to think about what will happen to them if they (the parents) are unable to care for them before their children are adults.\n\nShe never bothered to involve the girls' bio dads or even find out who they are.  She chose that.  If they end up in the foster system she only has herself to blame.  Honestly at this point her best bet may be to DNA test the girls and see if she can find their fathers.  Maybe their extended families would want to help them.", "You\u2019re absolutely NTA. It\u2019s not your responsibility to raise her children that you never had a relationship with. Her actions are catching up with her and her daughter are stuck in the middle, but that has nothing to do with you.

I feel bad for her daughters, but still not your responsibility to take on.", "NTA, they aren\u2019t your responsibility", "NTA.  Children's services will attempt to track down Anna's family and ask them to take the girls, they might contact you as well.  So, her family may be the ones sending them into foster care not you.", "NTA\nThey aren't your responsibility. Anna only has herself to blame for how things have ended up family wise . It's up to her to get in touch with her own family members to see of anybody is willing to take these children on. And as awful as it is, they probably will end up in foster care but again, that's Anna's responsibility not yours. You can walk away with a clean conscience here.", "NTA. She should blame herself for getting knocked up twice not knowing who the fathers are.", "NTA. It\u2019s a shitty situation for everyone. Those are kids that are not your family and a woman that is not your family. You have no responsibility to anyone and to use your dead dad for guilt is despicable.\n\nNobody should raise kids if they aren\u2019t 100% ready. It\u2019s often hard and exhausting.

You have no obligations to these children or Anna. They aren't your siblings and even if they were, you ultimately have the choice. It doesn't sound like you are that old either (I say this in terms of potentially being stable financially or whatever) so would you even be able to take care of them?

Second you don\u2019t even know them. Third you don\u2019t have some kind of relationship with her. Fourth you left your fathers house because you could live their. The list goes on and on. You have more reasons to ignore and leave them than to take care of them.", "NTA. It may sound cruel, and I feel sorry for the girls. But they are not your responsibility. Anna has no right asking such a huge thing from you.", "NTA. Based on what you described you lived with the girls for about a year before you left for your grandparents. You have no relation or obligation to them.", "Nta .no when they end up in care she will only have herself to blame this is on her", "NTA. I don't necessarily think it was wrong of Anna to ask, she's trying to do the best for her kids, but at the same time, kids are not something to be pushed on anyone. From what I can gather, you're young, you didn't have much of a relationship with them to speak of, and if you don't feel the emotional need to take care of them, then it'll be a struggle. \n\nI have a friend who took custody of her 16-year-old niece recently. She's about 23. She struggles regularly; kids are hard. She chose this because she cares for her niece like a sister; if she did not, she would be over her head. \n\nThe situation sucks, but that doesn't make it your responsibility.", "I repeat this a lot, but I have two single friends, both of whom are foster mothers. They are GREAT, loving moms\u2026 much better than the shitty bio parents. Not every foster home is a Dickensian nightmare", "NTA. The physical, emotional, and financial needs to raise the children is not something to treat lightly. Applying for guardianship, or her even signing over her rights has several issues. Guardianship requires a court application and approval, signing her rights over requires DCF approval and oversight of you as a foster parent, adoption is lengthier, and more intensive and expensive, and should the kids'father show up even in 5-10 years, he could take them. If you're ok with not taking them, perhaps you can help by finding any of her relatives? If you do decide to take the children, get every term of the agreement in writing and notarized. Hiring a lawyer would be beneficial.", "NTA - she has the unique opportunity to find then adoptive parents right now. Vet them and explain to her children what\u2019s happening and allow them to also have a part in choosing them. Instead she\u2019s trying to just foist them upon anyone she once knew and emotionally manipulate them into taking them, which is not a great tactic. She shouldn\u2019t want her children with people who resent then. She should consider having a social worker help her find someone for her kids. But no, you are absolutely not an AH.

This is your life. You have absolutely no obligation to anyone but yourself and your remaining family and those girls are no relation to you.

About how old would the girls be?", "NTA She needs to reach out to her estranged family.

My heart goes out to her and the girls but they are not your responsibility.", "NTA\n\nAnna's attempt to emotionally manipulate you into raising her children didn't quite pan out, did it? Anna has only herself to blame for her current conundrum. You are under no obligation to take on children for whom you have no affection. She is trying to burden you to spare herself the stress. She has made her decisions in this life. I'm sorry that her daughters will bear the brunt of who she is. They are innocent and I'm sorry for them. But your life is still your own and you owe Anna nothing. Do not sign up for more than you can handle.", "NTA - Interesting logic there\u2026.why would you be to blame? You aren\u2019t their parent.

And how old are they now?", "NTA you were her last hope, I can't imagine how hard it must be knowing you can't prevent dying and having to let your children go into the foster care system. No, you owe her nothing but maybe you could suggest her reaching out to a social worker now to see if there is any plan she can put in place. Encourage her to write to her family, the maternal grandparents may not know or perhaps there are other relatives? I agree you shouldn't take them, but I can't imagine how much it took for her to reach out to a stepson she hadn't seen in years.", "She's very wrong to ask. She was never family to OP and now wants something from him because she's burned every bridge. It's awful for those two girls but reaching out to someone when you contributed to their dysfunctional childhood because you want something of them is absolutely an AH move.", "Isnt it a criticism of the mother who doesn't know the father of either child?", "NTA.

I do feel for the girls, so sad.", "Also does OP realistically even have the setup and resources to care for two kids who have lost their mom?  Foster kids can at least get in therapy (it really depends on where they are, some systems are way better than others).", "What are the odds of adoption for older kids? OP says they're too young to be able to function on their own, but I don't think they're under five.", "NAH - I don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite so black and white. If Anna was behaving completely selfishly, she wouldn\u2019t be trying to arrange care for her girls. She could very easily bury her head in the sand and let someone else deal with it. She lashed out when OP refused, likely out of frustration and lack of control. Given the context, I don\u2019t begrudge her that. OP is acting selfishly, but is completely justified (and very likely making the right decision for themselves and the girls) in doing so. It\u2019s extremely unfortunate on both sides, and I think everyone is doing the best they can with the situation. Life is messy and sucks a lot of the time. Anna and dad fucked up early on with OP, and this is one of the consequences.", "> I personally would\n\nYou have no idea if you would or not.

In this case do you really think their mother, who has a long history of drug addiction, has no idea who fathered either of those girls and has no family to help her at all has prioritized their education and has a college fund for each? Or should the OP pay for their college when he is barely an adult himself?", "I don't fall into the category of extended family to even consider that. We are not biologically or legally related (or through marriage, since no marriage took place). But even if we were, I don't care about these kids or have any desire to start up something with them after all this time.", "Their finances (secret wealth) has nothing to do with the situation.

Not sure how old the kids are.", "I was never her stepson. She was never my stepmother. Legally and in an emotional sense.

Her kids weren't either back then.", "It doesn\u2019t really matter if they are related.\nOP isn\u2019t obligated to take on the children if they\u2019re biologically related and sometimes people choose to take care of children they are not genetically connected to", "I was never part of the equation for her.

It is society's fault that there is no option for these children to be safely cared for regardless of the mistakes made by their mother.

You do realize the girls didn\u2019t make any of Anna's choices for her, yes?", "Not her behaviour, the fate of the children in a shitty foster system.", "Thats not what was being said. Good grief.", "Eh, people have sex. Sometimes they get pregnant. Maybe she wasn't careful enough with birth control, but my wife and I have certainly gotten pregnant without meaning to so I'm not gonna judge. It's not somehow wrong to be a single parent.\n\nMy criticism of her is more about how she treated OP. Also, the fact that she has literally nobody to turn to almost certainly indicates that she has treated people poorly her whole life. All that is her fault, but that doesn't mean her daughters should pay the price.", "No, she is being completely selfish, if the best chance she can come up with is the OP.", "Don't worry, this person always posts like she's so much better than everyone else and would always make the proper choices in situations they've never been in lol.

Based off the timeline you gave, those babies would be no older than six or seven, probably younger. OP, you are NTA. Heck, I feel like it would be bad for all of you if you took them. You\u2019re barely an adult yourself, taking on the girls would crush your ability to grow and flourish. \n\nTotally ignoring the fact that you barely know them and barely have a relationship with them, it could potentially be so damaging for all of you if you did. We see a lot of older siblings raising younger siblings after their parents died young on here, and it is always so hard for everyone involved. And here\u2026 you don\u2019t even have the foundation of sibling love to make it work.  No, it would hurt all of you. It would be better for them to go to people who are in a position to care for them properly. \n\nWhat a horrible situation. Sorry about\u2026 all that crap you had to endure growing up.", "If the guy has like a crazy amount of wealth he shouldn't *have* to do it, but he'd still be an asshole", "Nope don\u2019t let those thoughts enter.

At least not in the way most people would want someone to know their kids when they leave them to raise them. I never really spent time with the kids or interacted with them and I haven't seen them in years.\n\nIn the end it's a shitty person who is asking something from someone who had to deal with her shittiness. That's where part of the anger comes from. It's not like we were on good terms before.", "Goofy take. We can put men on the moon and clone sheep and have billionaires coming out of our noses but not keep children fed and housed and clothed? It's a question of priorities.", "Actually, a lot of cultures have had systems where many adults in the community would care for the community\u2019s children, and something like the modern foster care system would have been unnecessary to them.

You seem to be saying that even if taxes do solve the problem, you would rather have more money for yourself than see children safe. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but yours makes me very, very sad.", "So by \"removing the losers,\" it sounds like you're advocating for murdering anyone who doesn't contribute? Is that right? Also, just to be clear, how long after someone has been laid off before they deserve to die? 6 months? A year? Does this include stay at home parents? I'm just wondering if, in your utopia, I should be dead for not working for the last 3 years to help my autistic son. I guess he would also have been murdered when he was diagnosed 3 years ago, though, right? After all, I need to work, and he's just a loser not worthy of living in your world.\n\nYou're ridiculous.", "Sadly you are correct. Children of parents like this almost always have poorer outcomes in education and the job market and are more likely to get into drugs and crime. I've worked with adopted and fostered kids and it's tragic. Nothing much can be done other than prevention. Birth control, abortion, and adopting as babies works best. I love all those kids I've met but they were all broken most very badly broken and self destructive. Sad.", "Without trying to be disrespectful to you, I feel the need to point out that several other people seem to have known what I meant and that you are the only one who apparently didn't.", "No, I didn't. In none of my comments did I say Anna's behavior are society's fault, as you claim. Why do you want to put words in my mouth?", "I guess where I\u2019m coming from here is: \n\nA dying woman asked you to do something because she was desperate. It\u2019s not about how much you interacted with the kids, I suspect, but that she knows you to be a good person and that\u2019s why she wants to leave her kids in your hands - she\u2019s trying to do right by them, as a good mother should. A misguided request, perhaps, but not an AH move.\n\nYou turned her down, which is also not an AH move, at all. No child should be raised by someone who doesn\u2019t enthusiastically want them. \n\nHowever, it seems like there\u2019s a lot of justified anger there on your part but by your own admission you don\u2019t have a relationship with this woman, never have had, you don\u2019t know what she\u2019s like or what changes she\u2019s made in her life since you lived with her. \n\nSo, on the whole it seems you may have lashed out at a dying and desperate woman over years-old unresolved issues, while she then guilt-tripped and emotionally blackmailed you. So maybe you\u2019re both tiny AHs for that, but I went with NAH because it\u2019s an obviously traumatic and stressful situation for both of you, and because the actual issue at hand (her asking you to take the kids/you saying no) neither of you are AHs for. \n\nI\u2019m sticking with my judgement, despite the fact I know I\u2019ll continue to be downvoted into oblivion because Reddit has an obsession with \u201cmaking women pay for their mistakes\u201d.", "Man I wish I had a billionaire coming out of my nose, I'm sure it would be painful but I feel like there's be some grounds for significant compensation.", "European culture used to be just as communal.

You can hope all you want for some optimal world, or you can try and change it yourself. These kids will be cared for, but most won\u2019t have a guy adopt their kid.

She was quick at times to get mad when I was trying to get something out of dad that I needed. She also wasn't the loving and attentive mother to her girls when I lived there and having kids screaming all the time because they're fed and left there the rest of the time isn't something that makes you think gee, this is a great person.\n\nI do hold my dad more responsible for it all regarding me. He was my parent and had the responsibility to me. As far as I'm concerned they're as bad as each other and most hard feelings are toward him.\n\nBut this dying woman was still an asshole when she knew me. Never took any time to actually know me. Then comes to me when she gets sick and wants me to help her clean up the mess she made of her life, by caring for her kids, because she has nobody in her life anymore and knows they need someone. To track me down like that, yeah it shows desperation, but I think it's a shitty thing to ask in the context.\n\nBut I do accept your judgement.", "Yeah that\u2019s how life works, many times you end up paying for your mistakes, as it should be.
