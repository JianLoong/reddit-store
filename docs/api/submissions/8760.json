{"id": 8760, "submission_id": "10pze1c", "title": "AITA for telling my late dad's ex girlfriend that I don't want her kids?", "selftext": "Backstory that explains some of this: My dad dated Anna on and off from the time I was 13. In their one extended off period (almost two years) she had a daughter and was pregnant with another daughter. They got back together while Anna was still pregnant and were back to their on and off relationship. For the most part they lived together through all the off parts of their relationship from the beginning. The only exception was the off part when they were apart for almost two years. It was rough living there when they weren't together. They brought other people back and were generally just toxic and had a shitty relationship. I moved out of dad's house and in with my grandparents when I was 17. It was a lot for me. I had never bonded or had any kind of love for Anna or her girls while I lived with them. I was just trying to survive the upheaval my dad was putting me through. I don't even remember how old the girls were when I last saw them. Pretty small though. A few times dad would tell me to be their big brother or whatever but he was more wrapped up in Anna. They broke up a few months before he died two years ago. He and I weren't really talking in the last year of his life.\n\nSo Anna has been diagnosed with some neurological disease and reached out to my grandparents to raise her girls. She has nobody. Doesn't know the bio fathers of the girls, doesn't have any family she's in touch with (she was deep in drugs and alcohol for years and they disowned her over it and were not interested in hearing from her again) and no friends left. My grandparents said no because they had nothing to do with the girls and had not considered them surrogate granddaughters. To be honest even before dad died I was the only person in his house they had a relationship with. They didn't see dad anymore because of how he was.\n\nNext up was me. She tracked me down on social media and told me she needed to talk about something important. She explained to me that she's sick, and I could see it in the way she was walking and talking, and she knows the girls are too young to survive when she gets worse and she wants better for them. She said after years of being their brother, and of living with them, she wanted me to take her girls and raise them and let them visit her but once she's gone, to be the family they don't have otherwise. I was shocked and even a little pissed if I'm honest because Anna was asking for something huge for me for people who were essentially strangers. We were never a family but she was acting like we had been at some point. She saw how I was reacting and said my dad would have wanted me to do this and to think about how I lost my mom and dad and how I should consider her girls. It pissed me off so much I told her I didn't want her kids and I walked away. She asked me how I could do this to her girls and called me a dick. She told me when they end up bounced around in foster care, I will only have myself to blame.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1675172626, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pze1c/aita_for_telling_my_late_dads_ex_girlfriend_that/", "score": 1368, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's not wrong to ask, but she is way out of line guilting you about your dad and calling you names.", "NTA at all! If you didn't make the kids they are in no way, shape or form your responsibility. Sounds like she knows the kids are bound for foster care, and wants to blame everyone else for the fact she's a terrible mother, and person.", "NTA. She tried to guilt you into it and you quite rightly said no. They are not your responsibility.

That sounds so stressful and awful and I'm so happy you were able to eventually move to your GPs'.\n\nSecondly, I'm sorry for the situation these kids have found themselves in, it's hard to lose a parent at any age, let alone (for all intents and purposes) be orphaned this young.\n\nAll that said, they aren't your responsibility. You may have or have had a loose brotherly relationship them, but that doesn't necessarily translate or shift to one of parenting. \n\nKnowing your caregiver isn't enough, they need to be loved.

It's tricky because her children don't and haven't deserved the hectic life she lead and made them lead but that doesn't mean that you are a bad person for not wanting to suddenly raise children that you don't know.

I'm baffled as to why she thought you wanted more upheaval in your life.

If you are doing alright for yourself and want to be magnanimous, you could offer to buy DNA tests for the kids to see if they can track down the dads.

If I knew I was dying soon, I would reach out to literally anyone I trusted to see if they would take care of them so they didn't have to go into the system.

I'm going to guess probably not given how she was back then.", "They're a big responsibility and I know from experience that grieving kids need someone who loves them, not someone who feels nothing for them, during that time. Someone who longs to help kids and who wants to be there for them will always be better. That's not me.

You are righteously angry that she and your dad tore your family apart.", "I\u2019m possibly being foolish but I don\u2019t see the cause for anger here. She is dying and she is leaving her daughters alone in this world - they\u2019re going to end up in the care of strangers either way. From her perspective it\u2019s better to try and place them with someone who knows them, and who she knows has a good head on their shoulders, rather than allowing them potentially to be separated or abused in the foster system (not that this is a fait accompli either, but it does happen and can\u2019t necessarily be controlled for.) \n\nYou don\u2019t have to say yes, of course, and her guilt trip is beyond the pale, but I don\u2019t think the request alone is worth getting worked up over.", "It's no different than a stranger on the street asking you to take their kids.\n\nOP is not related to the ex or her children.

If a friend or acquaintance asked me to do this despite not one drop of blood being shared I wouldn\u2019t find it audacious, I\u2019d probably be touched that they thought so much of me that they\u2019d trust me with their children. Again - it doesn\u2019t mean I would take the children (although I *personally* would but that\u2019s due to personal circumstances outside of this hypothetical) but I don\u2019t see why OP was instantly *angry* with the request alone. \n\nEdited to add emphasis.", "NTA - EXCUUUUSE me! If they end up being bounced around foster care it will be on HER and her life long behaviors! NOT you! You didn't make those babies  exist.

Foster care must allow for safe contact with extended family at times - that still sounds like a pain in the ass for you, but also an immeasurable comfort for the girls. I know the system is crazy and overstressed, but maybe there's some help available for people in you and the girls' situation. Bottom line, though, it's not your problem.", "NTA. You fled your home to be away from her and she had to track you down. These girls have no relation to you. \n\nI hope Anna's family steps up but you aren't responsible for all the relationships she's destroyed in the past that made her desperate enough to reach out to you.", "NTA- she is blame for the foster care situation. Anna should have planned her life better as far as procreation.  You are not at fault here.", "NTA- She\u2019s trying to make you feel guilty while also\ntaking her anger out on you.\n\nYou have no responsibility to them. It\u2019s unfortunate but that\u2019s life.", "i mean... obviously NTA... sounds like you're not too old yourself... so taking on the responsibility of two kids is way beyond anything you should do... it's of course heartbreaking for the little girls... but maybe the mother should use the time trying to find decent fostercare for her girls instead of talking to the kid of a dude she banged years ago....", "NTA - It sucks for the girls, truly, but the reality is, that you are not to blame.  Everyone who chooses to bring children into the world has to think about what will happen to them if they (the parents) are unable to care for them before their children are adults.\n\nShe never bothered to involve the girls' bio dads or even find out who they are.  She chose that.  If they end up in the foster system she only has herself to blame.  Honestly at this point her best bet may be to DNA test the girls and see if she can find their fathers.  Maybe their extended families would want to help them.", "You\u2019re absolutely NTA. It\u2019s not your responsibility to raise her children that you never had a relationship with. Her actions are catching up with her and her daughter are stuck in the middle, but that has nothing to do with you. Pretty entitled of her to think that you should or even would take on that responsibility for someone who didn\u2019t even really like/love. The name calling, manipulation and gaslighting is just the cherry on top that she hasn\u2019t changed her behavior. I feel bad for her daughters, but still not your responsibility to take on.", "NTA, they aren\u2019t your responsibility", "NTA.  Children's services will attempt to track down Anna's family and ask them to take the girls, they might contact you as well.  So, her family may be the ones sending them into foster care not you.", "NTA\nThey aren't your responsibility. Anna only has herself to blame for how things have ended up family wise . It's up to her to get in touch with her own family members to see of anybody is willing to take these children on. And as awful as it is, they probably will end up in foster care but again, that's Anna's responsibility not yours. You can walk away with a clean conscience here.", "NTA. She should blame herself for getting knocked up twice not knowing who the fathers are.", "NTA. It\u2019s a shitty situation for everyone. Those are kids that are not your family and a woman that is not your family.

Than she berates him for saying no. \nI think the fact she asked him for something he not only didn\u2019t want to do and in reality couldn\u2019t and her entitled attitude didn\u2019t sit right with most people. \nAlso realize that the chance of family services placing 2 young children with a 21 year old unrelated person would be about zero.", "You\u2019re criticising a comment I made using information I received after it was made.", "Ah so OP said \u201cwhen she\u2019s gone\u201d and I therefore assumed the condition was terminal. \n\nOP\u2019s age is also not in the post, so I didn\u2019t know they were 21. That obviously changes my perspective.\n\nI wasn\u2019t holding it against her for berating him because he said he got angry at the request first. So I felt like they were both just reacting due to the extreme environment, hence my judgement.", "I\u2019m on mobile. Only see 1 hr ago and since it was further down in the thread, I assumed you continued to be surprised by the downvotes after the info was given. My bad."]}
