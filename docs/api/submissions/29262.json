I\u2019m having an \u201ca baby is brewing\u201d themed party with lots of cauldrons and classy spooky vibes as BF (32M) and I are pretty classy spooky ourselves. I\u2019ve shared with BFs mom the decorations I\u2019m buying and ideas I have about the party and she\u2019s been very excited, I think we have a pretty good relationship and we get along very well. The party is now 2 weekends away and BFs mom is now showing me that she\u2019s been BUYING decorations for my party\u2026 which I will not be using because they\u2019re halloween decorations that are pretty cheesy and not at all what I\u2019m wanting, I told both her and my BF no and that I don\u2019t think those fit well. Not a big fuss. Today she has come up with the idea that my BFs 9 yr old daughter needs to dress up in costume and I reminded her that this is not a costume party. Neither my BF or I are dressing up but she is adamant that it will make BFs daughter look like part of the family\u2026 we would still look like a family as we\u2019re all going to dress nicely and relatively coordinated. She has also come up with the idea that she needs to dress as a witch because of the cauldrons and one witch that is on my cake topper\u2026 I had to point out that the witch is pregnant and that would be silly to have his daughter dressed that way since that is supposed to be me on the topper. I\u2019ve brought my concerns to my BF and he agreed that she does not need to dress up especially as a witch, we\u2019re both going to talk to his daughter tonight because we\u2019re pretty sure she doesn\u2019t even want to dress up and BFs mom is once again using her like a dress up doll. This hasn\u2019t stopped his mom and she\u2019s been sending halloween themed big sister tshirts asking which she should buy\u2026 she also keeps scolding me about not including his daughter in the decorating process that is yet to happen because she \u201cneed to be involved\u201d but I\u2019ve seen the way she decorates for bday parties and it\u2019s just not happening. I want to put my foot down and say \u201cThis isn\u2019t about his daughter, please stop trying to make it about her.\u201d but I feel like that is rude and selfish sounding. \n\nWriting all this out is also reminding me that she forgot my birthday earlier this year because she had his daughter and daughters friend over for a sleepover and got upset that we were going out to celebrate and couldn\u2019t watch the girls\u2026 when she already said she would watch them\u2026 I\u2019m feeling less selfish now.", "created_utc": 1697747337, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17bsrlp/wibta_for_telling_bfs_mother_that_our_gender/", "score": 167, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Get over yourself.", "\nOp, when you see those videos online of couples who have children revealing the gender of their baby what's the common thing you see? Usually their other kids are involved in the whole thing. Why? Because that's their family that's changing, the party is about their family. \n\nI get that you're not married to your partner, and therefore, the 9yro isn't formally related to you in any way. But, her dad is your partner. She's your partners family. Her family is changing and she should be allowed to contribute to the celebration. Does she need to pick out every detail of the party? No, but she should be know she is included and be made to feel that was. Is your partners' mum a bit pushy? Yes, but it's a change to her family too and she's probably very excited and concious this will have a big impact on 9yro.\n\nYou're throwing a party to announce the gender (I've no clue what a reverse gender reveal is) of the newest addition to the family, family members should be involved. It's not all about you. This is one of those times in life where you have to let go of micromanaging aesthetic party themes and celebrate the life that's joining your family with your family. \n\nYTA it's just a party, people care more about the health of the baby and the happiness of your family", "Yes, yta. Sorry but you sound like a child yourself.  Let's say the daughter wants to wear a costume. So what? She's 9. And you've seen his she decorates and 'it's not happening'? Ok Martha Stewart, at some point someone showed you how to decorate and was patient with you while you got it wrong until you got it right. \n\nI know,  'it's your first baby'. Ok. And billions of others were first babies too.. it's not a miracle. It's not even your boyfriend's first baby.  That should tell you something\n \n\nIt's almost funny how much you're making of this reveal party. Do you really think anyone cares that much? Sorry to be blunt, but there's a reason so few people do anything but bitch about these self indulgent get together. \n\nThe grandmother, who by your own admission stepped up when your boyfriend needed the help.  She's trying to stay relevant and all you can do is complain. \n\nI bet you're getting a discount, living on that family plot. Why don't you get your own place and then bitch about the woman.  Right now my guess is she's saving you a lot of money. \n\nYour bf has a mother.  That's the brakes. Don't live there if it's that much trouble for poor misunderstood you,  who is just trying to hold the single most spectacular gender reveal party ever held.

You have a lot to learn from her.", "YTA.  You do realize you\u2019re stripping your step-daughter from part of the joys of being a part of your big announcement. It\u2019s her sibling. \n\nYou let her attend a special ultrasound session, so it sounds like you\u2019re trying to include her in the pregnancy. \n\nLet this child shine at your party as well. It sounds she doesn\u2019t have a stable life with mom, and it will make her feel more secure. \n\nMaybe you could do a cake topper of a pregnant witch holding hands with a smaller girl witch. Let her dress up. These are memories you want to cherish.", "Look I can't really judge because you and your MIL are both just making this about yourself by now. I want to know what the daughter in question thinks about all of this really.\n\nAnyways ultimately it is your party, your spiel ..I never really got why it is even a thing, but well I guess the US likes to party :D \n\nWith that in mind, if the daughter is hyped about all of this, and you really really don;t want the party to have any resemblance to Halloween - a childish theme, you could do a small family reveal, like you three dressing up in spooky costumes, having the Halloween cheesy decor and reveal to her in secret the gender of her little sibling before the actual party. That's actually kinda nice thing I think... but only if she really wants and enjoys that kind of thing. \n\nNot all kids are that crazy about these types of things, so if this is just your MIL being noisy just for the sake of arguing, she's a complete AH. Anyways I feel like it is essential to find out how your step-daughter's feeling about all of this.", "I'd say YTA. I understand that you want to plan your own party. But you should remember that your boyfriend's daughter is also a part of your family, now that you are going to have her sibling. Regardless of the fact you aren't married, you are a mother like figure in her life wether you like it or not. You should make an effort to make her feel included. Instead of rejecting your MIL ideas, find a way to include your \"step-daughter\" in the planning. Maybe talk to her to plan a \"classy-spooky\" outfit together. \n\nI get that being pregnant makes you want to be celebrated and you want to feel special. But you should remember that the most important thing about pregnancy is that it creates family. A party is just a party, look at the bigger picture. You have two choices: either actively reject any suggestions from your MIL to include your step daughter, making things difficult for yourself, your bf, your MIL, but most importantly isolating her by letting her know you don't care. Or find your own way to include her, something that makes you happy and makes her feel involved and will nourish your relationship with her. \n\nIf you don't find it in your heart to care about her, know that how you treat her will reflect the love she feels for your child, and that can make or break a family.", "YWBTA\n\nAs much as this is a gender party, it\u2019s also a big sister moment for his 9 year old. To not include her is cruel", "So. You are acting like a 9 year old is competing with you for attention at a stupid gender reveal party? Yes, YTA. Those poor kids are going to have such immature parents. At least grandma is looking out for them.", "YTA. Gender reveal parties are creepy and weird. You don\u2019t know your babies gender, so you are only really celebrating their genitals. Weird reason for a party.", "YTA. No one apart from maybe you and your partner gives a fuck what gender your kid is going to be. This shit needs to die out.\n\nEg.

You better hope it is not the last because she will be all over your child too breaking your rules and boundaries (which she is currently doing with the party).  I would strongly suggest you and or bf sit down with Grandma and discuss why she feels she needs to \"fix\" things for the girl.  At least that way you know what you are dealing with and can come up with healthy ways for Grandma to be involved - or if you are dealing with someone who feels she knows better than everyone and needs to \"fix\" everything you can decide where to put the lines and work together as a couple to keep them.  I am an older person and has seen older women do this kind of stuff - they often have good intentions,  think they are helping and just want to be part of the family.  However, when you are dealing with a person who feels she needs to step in and take over your family is headed for a lot of disagreements and strife - best to just get that out in the open and deal with it now before another child comes into the mix.", "YTA, your theme sounds exhausting, and all of this is exactly why people did not traditionally give themselves baby showers.", "INFO: where\u2019s your BF at with all this?", "You all seem insufferable.", "YWBTA if you worded it like that when you talk to her. I understand how you feel and I would be upset too but it sounds like her main concern is that her granddaughter will be getting left behind after this new baby comes. You and your boyfriend should have a chat with his mom to ease her worries and tell her child #1 will not be excluded, but that her inclusion will not be represented by silly costumes and tshirts. What's important is that she'll be there and she'll be a part of it. \n\nIt might be a difficult time for the 9 year old, to be honest. Your bf might have to put a bit more effort in his relationship with her so that she does not grow to resent/be jealous of her sibling, since sibling will be living with you and dad while she lives with her mom and that could make her feel like her connection with her dad is not as strong.", "YTA for having a gender reveal party.\n\nAlso for this:\n\n>she also keeps scolding me about not including his daughter in the decorating process that is yet to happen because she \u201cneed to be involved\u201d but I\u2019ve seen the way she decorates for bday parties and it\u2019s just not happening.

Our families know who we are, we\u2019re that creepy couple and we\u2019re gonna keep at it.

I\u2019m having an \u201ca baby is brewing\u201d themed party with lots of cauldrons and classy spooky vibes as BF (32M) and I are pretty classy spooky ourselves. I\u2019ve shared with BFs mom the decorations I\u2019m buying and ideas I have about the party and she\u2019s been very excited, I think we have a pretty good relationship and we get along very well. The party is now 2 weekends away and BFs mom is now showing me that she\u2019s been BUYING decorations for my party\u2026 which I will not be using because they\u2019re halloween decorations that are pretty cheesy and not at all what I\u2019m wanting, I told both her and my BF no and that I don\u2019t think those fit well. Not a big fuss. Today she has come up with the idea that my BFs 9 yr old daughter needs to dress up in costume and I reminded her that this is not a costume party. Neither my BF or I are dressing up but she is adamant that it will make BFs daughter look like part of the family\u2026 we would still look like a family as we\u2019re all going to dress nicely and relatively coordinated. She has also come up with the idea that she needs to dress as a witch because of the cauldrons and one witch that is on my cake topper\u2026 I had to point out that the witch is pregnant and that would be silly to have his daughter dressed that way since that is supposed to be me on the topper. I\u2019ve brought my concerns to my BF and he agreed that she does not need to dress up especially as a witch, we\u2019re both going to talk to his daughter tonight because we\u2019re pretty sure she doesn\u2019t even want to dress up and BFs mom is once again using her like a dress up doll. This hasn\u2019t stopped his mom and she\u2019s been sending halloween themed big sister tshirts asking which she should buy\u2026 she also keeps scolding me about not including his daughter in the decorating process that is yet to happen because she \u201cneed to be involved\u201d but I\u2019ve seen the way she decorates for bday parties and it\u2019s just not happening. I want to put my foot down and say \u201cThis isn\u2019t about his daughter, please stop trying to make it about her.\u201d but I feel like that is rude and selfish sounding. \n\nWriting all this out is also reminding me that she forgot my birthday earlier this year because she had his daughter and daughters friend over for a sleepover and got upset that we were going out to celebrate and couldn\u2019t watch the girls\u2026 when she already said she would watch them\u2026 I\u2019m feeling less selfish now.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's ok to not accept excess decorations \"thanks MIL! I don't need party decorations but I'll save these for future...\" (The joys of MILs hahaha)\n\nI don't think you're being controlling. I just see an overexcited/pushy gma who has no concept of party decorations boundaries (had one of those hahaha, she looooved the dollar store).\n\nYou're fine, just be nice but firm. Make sure 9yr-old is happy (if SHE wants to dress up, I'd let her. If SHE wants big sis shirts I'd let her. If SHE wants to be more involved, I'd find ways to do so, etc.)\n\nYou aren't a witch.

It is worth it to note that they\u2019ve not been together since before she was born as mom is a serial cheater so much so bfs daughter comes to us to tell us about fights and such she\u2019s overheard of her moms, it\u2019s alarming but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re here for. \n\nGrandma is so involved because we live on a family property, we live in a small house on the same land as her and she sees granddaughter quite frequently and helps out when work things arise. She\u2019s also so involved because from what I\u2019ve been told she was the sole one caring for her when she would visit her dad when she was younger because her dad worked a lot during ages 3 to 6ish. \n\nWe both are worried that grandma is trying to take the parenting role when she\u2019s around and bf has had to pull her aside and tell her to back off a lot lately. This really seems like another way of her trying to take control and parent bfs daughter. I don\u2019t parent her but we are close and hang out a lot, I even scheduled a private ultrasound so that she could see her baby sibling since she asked if she would be able to. I cannot express how excited bfs daughter is to be a big sister but I also know that grandma is trying to control things in her life and about her. \n\nReflecting maybe it\u2019s not right to say to not make it about bfs daughter but more to say \u201cgrandma you need to butt out\u201d", "Op stated in a comment that bf daughter is involved in party by reveal and other parts. Just not in the planning.", "That\u2019s the issue, she hasn\u2019t shown an ounce of interest in helping with the party.

She doesn\u2019t play dress up anymore and wants to be a mushroom for halloween\u2026 if she wanted to dress as a witch for this party without grandmas suggestion I\u2019d be genuinely shocked but like I said she\u2019s shown no interest. She doesn\u2019t hang out with grandma all the time so it\u2019s not her speaking for bfs daughter, we\u2019re meant to go shopping this weekend for our party clothes and she\u2019s been fine with that since we told her and trust me she\u2019s very vocal with what she is not fine with. She\u2019s involved with every other aspect of the party, I even booked a private ultrasound so she could see her baby sibling and found out the gender at that appointment (secretly so she doesn\u2019t know still) and if I really wanted her to not be involved the weekend the party is on isn\u2019t even a weekend her dad has her on and I asked her mom if it was ok that we had her for that day\u2026 if I didn\u2019t want her there I wouldn\u2019t do that.", "It's a reverse gender reveal, spooky October party with witches and cauldrons, but CERTAINLY NOT a Halloween baby shower \ud83d\ude44", "A baby shower is organized by friends and family of the to be parents to \"shower\" them with support.

We\u2019ve had halloween parties before, hell we met at a halloween party held by our friends it\u2019s nothing against halloween parties but I\u2019ve specifically asked that this not be treated as such out of respect for our baby because no one likes getting their party lumped in with a holiday. \n\nOn the subject of my step daughter she\u2019s shown no interest herself in any of the things that her grandma is suggesting. She\u2019s really only focused on finding out if she gets a little brother or little sister.

It *should* be at least a little about the 9 year old! Can you imagine how she must be feeling? A new sibling on the way, one that you obviously are excited about, but more than that, one that her dad is excited about - it would be extremely normal for her to feel scared or worried that she's going to be pushed out of this happy little family that you, her dad, and the new baby make. And you not wanting her very involved in this party, acting frankly like she's a bit of an annoyance and all the focus should be totally on you, doesn't help.\n\nYou could use this as an opportunity to show love and family for her, instead. You could use this as a really wonderful opportunity to make her feel secure and included, and reduce the likelihood she'll feel anxious, abandoned, or resentful.\n\nYou could use this as an opportunity to make it not just about YOU, but about the baby and the baby's family - big sister included.\n\nIs the extremely tiny details of your aesthetic really more important to you than she is? Than your family is?\n\nI can't imagine how hurt I'd feel.\n\nI also think that your MIL is trying to help in her own way, and even being supportive - heck, she's supporting the 'spooky' theme the best she can, by trying to contribute. You could also help her feel a little bit included (but more than that, make a smooth relationship with her): I'm pretty sure you could incorporate a few of the silly Hallowe'en-y decorations, even if you repainted them, or used them in unexpected ways, or just...let them be there.  As a visible symbol that you value the family. It's an INCREDIBLY minor thing to do, to make people feel loved and included. \n\nAlso, note that the MIL keeps focusing on the 9 year old, and ways to make the 9 year old feel included and special. That should be a sign, I think; a sign that she's worried the 9 year old *isn't* feeling included.  I think you might have hurt that little girl.\n\nAlso, YTA for having a party with cool decorations and spooky decor and cool outfits and making yourself into a neat character and expecting a kid to *not* be excited/want to have cool outfits, etc.  I think your guests would honestly expect it.  It would be like buying yourself a great big chocolate cake and handing the kid a stale bran muffin. Weird, and something your guests would raise their eyebrows at.\n\nBasically, you might not intend to be TA, but you are. You're extremely excited (congratulations by the way!) and maybe losing sight of others' feelings. What's more important - your exact aesthetic, or your loved ones feeling included and loved?", "Exactly this. YTA, OP. In fact, you downright sound like a jealous little girl even younger than your stepdaughter. MY BABY SHOWER IS ALL ABOUT MEEEEEEEEEE. It's actually about your baby, who you want to have an involved sibling, especially given the idea. MIL is being too overbearing but there's really no harm in your stepdaughter getting part of the attention.", "100% agree", "She did say she discussed this all with her boyfriend and he agreed daughter does not need to dress up and that they are going to sit her down and talk to her about what she actually wants vs. What grandma wants.  And it does sound like this is less that the daughter wants this and more that grandma likes to dress her up/  be involved in everything.  Letting grandma use the kid as a way to control things is a terrible standard to set, and it looks like the OP wants to talk to the daughter about what she actually wants rather than grandma.\n\nI was recently at a Harry Potter themed wedding shower, and it really was so beautifully done and the decorations were all classy and old school antique, and some cheap Halloween decorations would have been jarring and really taken away from the feel of it.  I don't blame the OP for not wanting someone else to step on her toes in party planning.  Though maybe if she talks directly to the daughter she can find a cute way to keep her involved and busy during the party - like hanging out cookies or running a game or something fun.", "That's how it sounds to me too.", "As stated in a previous comment she\u2019s involved in everything but party planning because again it\u2019s a party I\u2019m planning. When she has her birthday parties she picks the theme, decorations, where they should go, what cake she wants, I mean everything we\u2019re just left to make it happen so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s hard for her to understand that she\u2019s not in the planning for a party that is not hers and she never asked or showed interest in party planning that was all grandma telling me what I should do. \n\nI don\u2019t think it should HAVE to be said but if I wanted to have a Halloween party I would but I\u2019m not going to be having a Halloween party. I\u2019d have this theme anytime of the year, it\u2019s just happened to be now because it\u2019s when we\u2019ve found out. Again, bfs daughter has shown no interest in anything grandma has told me I have to have. If I had to guess she doesn\u2019t even know about what her grandma has been telling me to do, this is a very common theme from grandma. \n\nBF is informed on what has been going on and knows how his mom is, she\u2019s trying to get her hands on everything as he put it. He\u2019s had to step in a lot lately when it comes to his mom and trying to control what is happening in all three of our lives- I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s jealousy or a control thing but it\u2019s going too far. This isn\u2019t even including that earlier in my pregnancy she tried to make me feel bad for the dr I\u2019m seeing because I can only bring on person to the appointment and she was acting like I had that dr on purpose so BFs daughter couldn\u2019t see the baby\u2026 meanwhile I was scheduling a private ultrasound so BFs daughter could see her baby sibling and once grandma caught wind she self invited\u2026 I mean I could make lists of things she\u2019s done like this but this is my hill I\u2019m willing to die on because grandma doesn\u2019t need to have a say in a party that she is a guest to.", "Nailed it.", "Why do people not read the posts?

Around 10 pm while we were already out grandma called asking us if they could stay at our house because they were too noisy for her, bf explained we were out celebrating my birthday with friends and she got upset then claimed she never knew it was my birthday but wanted us to \u201cjust reschedule\u201d so she could go to sleep.
