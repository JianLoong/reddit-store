Do a shop of staples, things like pasta, rice, potatoes, bread, canned goods - things they can make basic meals from.

Sucks that your sister has health problems but that should have impressed all the more the need for her to spend or invest her money wisely. You shouldn't be responsible for saving them from their own foolishness, ESPECIALLY if they make you miserable while doing so.", "NTA it is not your responsibility to support two adults who don\u2019t want to work. They\u2019re just going to use you, and for what? What do you get out of it? That makes no sense.", "NTA - they are not your dependants, it is not for you to be the provider for functioning adults.

Nah, sod that.", "As someone who is currently in the situation you fought so hard to get away from, don\u2019t look back!! You\u2019re doing what\u2019s best for you. It\u2019s your life.

They are two grown adults that are capable of working, they just need to commit to it. The only one I feel warrants any help is your sister because she's in a fragile state with an ED and is probably very impressionable, which I'm sure your toxic mother uses to her advantage. If you're open to it, I'd suggest a private conversation between you and your sister to determine what you might be able to do. But setting boundaries and letting her know that it's not cool if she uses this opportunity to report to your mother. Best of luck. Situations like this are very messy.

You need savings set aside so that you have something there to fall back on when times are tough before you go helping anyone else. You have nothing to give, whereas grandma does. If she is playing the family card, you can too. They are her daughter and grandaughter after all and she has assets and you do not. Never live with people who are detrimental to your own mental, emotional and physical well being. I'm not a big fan of having toxic people in my life either, but that is up to you. I do not help those who are not helping themselves out of a situation. For instance someone who lost their job, lost their apartment, but were actively looking for work and have secured themselves another job, but need a place to stay until the pay checks are coming in and have a plan of getting on their feet again, then fine. But your family have no plans to help themselves at all, they want to live off you, for ever. That isn't helping them that is allowing leeches to suck the life out of you. My daughter has very poor health but there are cheap courses you can do online to train for working remotely, like Penn Foster etc,  which I helped my daughter pay for and she works doing a mix of admin, promotion and payroll all done lying on her sofa.", "NTA.\n\n Protect yourself", "NTA Tell your grandma that If she's so worried about your mother and sister then SHE needs to support them. Why should you spend the rest of your life in this awful situation when you should be taking care of you? Stand your ground. If grandma, mom and sister don't like it then that's on them.", "No! You are NOT required to support them! Grandma can help, you have earned your right to life! They can find employment or other ways to improve themselves. They are just jealous you are happy and doing well. Your grandmother is trying to guilt you into doing it because she doesn\u2019t want to either. \n\nLive your life! They have their own and are not entitled to live yours too. NTA.", "NTA.  Do not set yourself on fire to keep others warm.  Living with them and supporting them is detrimental to your mental and physical health.  Your grandmother wants you to literally sacrifice your life to support your mom and sister.  Do not do it", "I think deep down you know that you can't save drowning people. They will either sink or swim on their own, and hopefully, at some point when they finally realise that their situation is dire enough that they may attempt to tread water on their own. Its not your problem to fix.", "Ooh no no no, NTA, and don\u2019t go anywhere near them with your suitcase. If grandma wants to help them, she can move in with them or vv. If she keeps hassling you about it, go LC or NC for a while. They have no right to demand this of you, especially since they have pissed away a small fortune already. \nSave yourself.", "NTA. \n\nPlease go low contact with these people if you can't go no contact. They  will take, take, take as long as you let them.", "NTA\nStay away. Enjoy life. Spend your money the way YOU want!!\n\nThey are toxic as fuck and you are well within your rights tk cut them off. I did the same with my half-sister and Alcoholic Father. That resulted in cutting off half of the family, and my life is better for it.", "NTA \n\nYou aren't responsible to provide for your mom and sister. I would block your grandma quite frankly.", "Not the asshole.\n\nIt\u2019s not your job to take care of your mother and sister.  It\u2019s their jobs to take care of themselves.  If your sister has epilepsy then your parents have known about it and it\u2019s their job to deal with that.  Parents have a responsibility to take care of their kids, not the other way around.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA\u2026your mother and sister sound toxic.  Why is it your responsibility to take care of them?  You are right.  If your grandmother feels they should be taken care of, she has options to do so.  If they have true disabilities that prevent them from working, then should be able to get disability.  (If in the states.  Do not know what other countries have, if anything).  Many people work with issues like your sister has.  Not sure why mom does not work.  Sounds like they make their own troubles and expect everyone else to take care of them.  They are adults.  Time to figure it out for themselves.", "NTA Don't you dare go back into that nest of vipers. You escaped. Don't let them pull you back in.", "NTA.  When your parents divorced and your father gave them \u201cquite a significant amount of money,\u201d did he give you an equal amount?  From the information you have given, I\u2019m assuming he didn\u2019t.  If I\u2019m right, they started out ahead of you and have raced to get behind you.  How foolish of them both, especially your mother.  Your sister was really quite young to fully grasp the concept of planning for the future.  And how foolish of your grandma to think it is your responsibility to take care of them.  If she had taught your mother to be responsible, this situation wouldn\u2019t be what it is.  If she thinks they should get a free ride, she can be responsible for them.", "Nta and do not, under any circumstances, go back to live with them or give them any money. Give one penny and they\u2019ll milk a thousand from you, and not just once. Don\u2019t give them anything, don\u2019t accept anything, just say no and stand your ground. You can even go to another state/country to make sure they cant steal anything from you /mooch off you.", "Your entitled to your own life its not your responsibility to take care of anyone but yourself.  Your family sounds very toxic maybe you need to distance yourself from them for a while and change your number so grandmother or anyone else can't phone you. Good luck", "But pay the therapist directly."]}
