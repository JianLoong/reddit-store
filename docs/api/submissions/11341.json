My husband (35m) and I (32) have been together 10 years and have never had a great relationship with his parents. Unfortunately, due to COVID and some bad medication reactions, my father-in-law (65) needs a kidney transplant. The family is going through the whole rigamarole to get tested to see if anyone is a match, and my MIL has asked both my husband and I to get tested. The issue is, we don't want to. I'm in my last year of grad school and my partner just started a new job so neither of us can take extended time off, and we don't want to risk the potential health issues that could come with it. My husband has been waffling because he's (understandably) worried about his dad even if we aren't on great terms, but I've basically said, no way. My husband completely understands but we haven't taken it back to his mom yet. \n\nNow honestly, I could point to the above reasons for not wanting to from a practical standpoint, but the reality is that he has always been apathetic at best and actively rude at worst to me, so I don't feel like I owe him anything. I have three siblings and both of my parents, what if they need a kidney and I've given one of mine to someone who probably wouldn't give me one of his? \n\nWhat do you think?

So, you can contact them and explain briefly your dilemma (pressure to be tested/donate, your reluctance) and they can send you a letter or email saying that you were not a match.  The rets of your family will not know.  Good luck! NTA", "It's your *organs*. They don't grow back! NTA in the least, mil and fil deserve to hear it.\n\nHOWEVER, if you want a low-conflict option, you can \"get tested\", tell the doctor you're being pressured and don't want to donate and they'll mark you as \"not a suitable candidate for donation in this case\". It's on the table if you want a quiet life.", "YWNBTA. \n\nYou are never obligated to get tested or give an organ to anyone, no matter the relationship. \n\nIf, however, you want to say no without anyone making a big deal of it... it's my understanding that in situations like this you can go to the testing appointment, tell the doctor that you are being pressured and do NOT want to donate and they will officially mark you down as not a candidate for donation. You may even be able to call the testing center, explain your predicament and that you're being pressured to donate when you're not comfortable with it and they may be able to mark you as not a match without seeing you. You can then have something that says that you were not an appropriate match and no one in your husband's family ever has to know that it's because you didn't want to.", "NTA.\n\nYou have bodily autonomy.\n\nWe don't get shitty at people who refuse to give blood, which is a lot less dangerous than giving a kidney. Then why get shitty at someone who refuses to donate a kidney?", "Definitely NTA. No one should be coerced into a medical procedure they aren\u2019t comfortable with. No matter how minor. \n\nIt\u2019s good to know about getting tested but telling the testing center you\u2019re being forced and having them submit paperwork saying you aren\u2019t a suitable match/donor.", "NTA this is your body. You are not obligated to save your husband's parents.", "NTA A kidney is not something another person can expect or demand from you, even if they\u2019ve treated you well.", "NTA.\n\nYou would be donating a body part, and unlike the liver, kidneys don't regrow, so you would only be able to donate to one person. No one is obligated to give anyone else a body part; there's a reason why doctors make sure that the donor was not bribed or coerced in any way. It's something that has to be freely offered, and you don't want to donate. Simple as that.", "NTA and no explanation is needed from you at all. Your body part, your decision.", "NTA. That is a major surgery and that has to be voluntarily. Nobody can blame you for not wanting it. It is a big risk and you choose what to do with your body. But time shouldn\u2019t be an issue. If you don\u2019t want to this it\u2019s okay but timing is not a good reason (except you\u2019re pregnant or so) for not doing it. Not wanting to take the risk for your FIL is reason enough.", "YWNBTA, your body belongs to you. The assumption that you would simply give him one of your kidneys is insane, regardless of how he treats you. That's not some simple thing. Though humans can survive with 1 kidney, it's not difficulty free. Please do not do this unless you are absolutely sure.", "NTA. You and your husband also need to be on the same page in preparation for the \"Why?\" question when you refuse. Rather than a lengthy discussion, a better response would be, \"My/our reasons are personal,\" and refuse to discuss if further.", "NTA\n\nNo one owes anyone else use of their body parts.  \n\nAnd your concerns, for your own health, for how major surgery will affect your life, for the possibility of a person you are close to needing a kidney in the future, are all serious concerns,  deserving serious consideration.  \n\nWould your in-laws be able to pay to support you through the time of your recovery from surgery?  And to make up for any scholarships or stipends lost because you weren't doing the work for your graduate studies?  Being a graduate student is not easy.  You have classes, you have original research to do, you have to TA, and you're basically having to do anything your advisor and mentor asks you to do.\n\nYou might want to speak with your own doctor about this.  The ones looking for a match are not necessarily looking for the donor's best interest, health-wise.  If your doctor says it is an inadvisable risk, given your current situation, that might provide suitable camouflage.  And not wanting to donate makes donating inappropriate, which is something your doctor will agree with.", "100% NTA. Your kidney, your choice. No explanation needed or owed at all. It worries me a little that you would even have doubts about if you're an asshole or not. I also hope you do not care at all, how others will react to your choice. It's your fucking kidney!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is easy: You are fine to refuse. And YOU being a match is incredibly unlikely anyway. But NO is a complete statement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut to my understanding if you want to avoid that drama, your best course of action is to talk to the doctor and tell THEM you are not willing. Then you can tell them you were not compatible without actually being tested.", "NTA and they are being pretty pushy to even ask.  There\u2019s a reason we start with 2 kidneys (and 2 of some other organs).  Because one could be damaged and you still have the other one.  You should not be bullied into getting tested.", "NTA. Also, there\u2019s only the smallest possibility that you\u2019d be a match anyway.", "NTA -  Donating an organ is a huge thing. If theres only 1% of doubt in your mind, for whatever reason, it should be a no go.", "NTA, I understand why she\u2019s upset but it\u2019s a literal organ. No one is obligated to donate parts of their body.", "NTA. Your body, your choice. \n\nIn our family, we have a \"donate down\" policy where everyone is expected to try and donate to someone younger, but we don't expect young people in their prime to significantly shorten their lives to prop up the elderly.", "NTA. My husband has had a kidney transplant, from a relative donor. It was extraordinarily generous of him and we are forever grateful. However, we also don\u2019t hold any grudges against friends and family who didn\u2019t get tested because giving an organ that you don\u2019t have any idea whether you will need in the future or not and having a major surgery is a BIG deal.", "NTA. Your body, your choice. It\u2019s major surgery and not a small commitment.", "Just as an FYI, the kidney is the one organ that doesn't require ANY type of tissue match to be transplanted.  I found that out when my BIL needed one and I was tested (of my own free will.  I absolutely would have donated one to him, but his sister was a better match than I.) The doctors told us then that they could transplant a 0/5 match in a kidney.", "NTA for not wanting to donate a kidney.  However, you can solve this problem without offending your in laws.  You can take the blood test, and ask the hospital to notify you first if you are a match.  If it turns out that you are, you can decline donation without the family ever knowing you were a match.  That way you get credit for testing, and they will assume you just didn't match.", "NTA", "NTA. Guilting your children for not donating an organ is the most Boomer shit I've ever heard", "YWNBTA. you cant even take organs from a cadaver that could save someone else\u2019s life unless that person consented to it during their own life, so trying to force or coerce you into donating your kidney to someone who\u2019s an AH to you is beyond immoral. sucks for him that he needs a transplant, and if your husband ultimately decides to get a test, so be it, but you\u2019re not even related to him by blood nor is he kind to you. you have absolutely no reason to even get a test to see if you\u2019re a match, much less actually give him your kidney. i would give the practical reasons when refusing the family, just so as not to increase tension, and only bring up the fact that your FIL is an AH to you if they continue to press and you\u2019re too sick of it. good luck", "Get tested, and when they take the sample, tell them *you are being pressured to donate and don't want to*.\n\nThis automatically makes you unqualified to donate, and it's a mess and a half to get the doctors to accept a change in your answer.\n\nNTA.", "Do not take on a life-threatening surgery that will reduce your life expectancy even if successful with no complications for someone you don\u2019t even like. A favor of that scale is reserved for someone you love and who loves you in return. NTA", "100% NTA. \n\nThis is not your problem to fix.", "NTA! Your body,  your choice.", "NTA - simple - your body your rules - and such a surgery could greatly impact your whole future.", "NTA, but I\u2019d do the testing. The transplant folks will ask you if you are being pressured. You can say yes, and they will simply tell your FIL that you are not a match.", "They don\u2019t like to do female to male kidney transplants.  I tried for my brother but was told no for this reason.\nAlso you are not obligated to share your internal organs with anyone", "NTA your body your choice. Full stop.", "NTA. Your body. Your choice.", "NTA. Giving someone a kidney is a huge life risk with major complications that can easily happen.\n    It\u2019s not something to do lightly and you need to take care of yourself first. If your in laws are god people they may be upset but should understand. It\u2019s not an easy choice.", "I don't know if it's universal, but in many of the United States, coercion is a dealbreaker for organ donation.
