Since this started when they were preteens when your mother died I think they got the idea your dad should/would be responsible for them from somewhere.

Their childhood sounds like it was difficult and they are probably lacking a sense of acceptance since they don\u2019t feel like they have a family foundation.  It\u2019s doubly sad that they would use their children as pawns in this manipulation. \n\nAnd while you are definitely NTA, and you should in this situation set clear boundaries that this sort of behavior is unacceptable and completely unfair to your father, it does sound like you harbor some resentment that these half siblings are even part of your life.  It\u2019s understandable that you saw the hurt your mom caused your dad and it\u2019s almost impossible not to be mad at someone for hurting your parent in that way - even if that person is your other parent.  Your mom and her actions caused a lot of pain for you, and her second family is a natural extension of that pain.  \n\nBottom line is, do what can for the kids so that they feel special and loved on Christmas, while maintaining the boundaries you need.  Your pain and anger shouldn\u2019t have to be their burden and maybe you could teach your half siblings what being their for kids looks like.", "INFO: Who is giving you shit for cutting them out? If it\u2019s your dad, then I might have a different feeling.\n\nI\u2019m thinking NTA here for the simple reason that your half-siblings have manipulated their children into already thinking your dad would take on a grandparent role with them without even confronting your dad about it. They\u2019re essentially using their kids as emotional weapons, which is super fucked up; they\u2019re the ones that will be the most hurt and disappointed over it. \n\nThat being said, I do sense some ingrained resentment towards the half-siblings in general which is maybe something to work on. It\u2019s not their fault that your mom had an affair and split up her marriage with your father. I understand being protective of your family unit you have with your father, but remember they are also your family, whether they were put there under the best circumstances or not. It sounds like they are desperate for family and aren\u2019t going about it the most healthy way. Their father split, their mother died.

You may have to have a deeper conversation with them about if they want a relationship with you that doesn\u2019t include your dad, your dad has not forgiven your mom for cheating on him, and they need to take steps to find their other grandparents.

So they do not get to demand gifts for their children. \n\nIf your father wanted a relationship with them, he would have done so.\n\nYou cannot demand or force someone into a relationship. Sorry for your step siblings. \n\nYou don't need this drama in your life", "No, youre completely in the right here and I have no idea why your half siblings from your mother would think that your father should have any responsibilities towards your mother\u2019s affair babies and their children. Maybe your maternal grandparents put these ideas in their heads? You\u2019re so much NTA and please talk to your dad and tell them that this is going on because you seem to need reassurance in your stance. I hope all of us here will be able to give you some reassurance as well. Merry Christmas OP, you\u2019re not in the wrong here. Go LC with the half siblings for a while btw. I don\u2019t think their entitlement to your father\u2019s time and money serves you well", "NTA.  Looking at this situation from your father\u2019s viewpoint, the expectation is mind-boggling.  Why would he even want to interact with the children from your mother\u2019s affair?  And if he now understands that these adults are your half-siblings so he tolerates their presence at a family gathering, then he is a very emotionally mature man.  The idea that these children of an affair would expect him to behave like a grandfather to their children is outrageous.  And the fact that they are trying to fake a relationship or manipulate him into a relationship is inexcusable.  You are right to dump them from Christmas, and I would cut ties all together.  They have shown you who they are - entitled liars with a poor sense of boundaries.", "What the fuck did I just read? Did they ever consider your fathers feelings? They are a reminder for him that his ex wife cheated on him. Of course it's not their fault but why do they think he owes them anything? If anyone owes them it's their crappy biological father who left them. Just because you have a father that was there for you it doesn't mean they are entitled to it too only because you share the same mother. NTA", "NTA. Your half siblings are now parents and are more than old enough to understand why your father does not want a relationship with them and their children. They are assholes for disregarding that they are the result of an affair your mothers had and that this massive betrayal ended the marriage. They are old enough to understand and respect boundaries. Instead they are using their children to guilt and manipulate your father into having a relationship with them and their kids. They should be pursuing a relationship with their bio father instead of yours.", "Nta", "NTA- you are right.\n\nYour half siblings are entitled jerks and liars seeking to impose themselves & their demands upon your father.  \n\nAt least one of them is probably a devious opportunist, skilfully manipulating the children in the hope of forcing their way into your father's family via emotional blackmail so that they can then begin freeloading some financial advantages for themselves or other members of the own households.     \n\nAre you really sure that you want to have contact with relatives that behave in this way?", "NTA\n\nThey are using you for access to your father's money\n\nThese people don't care about you at all.  They resent you.", "NTA. Your step siblings need therapy lots of therapy.", "NTA. That is some next level manipulation and planning to put you and your dad \"on the spot\"/force you to behave a certain way. That the kids are now confused isn't *your* fault. It's a product of their parents manipulation. Good for you for not letting them use you like that.", "NTA but I would get them presents. Maybe not something big but something thoughtful. You\u2019d give a stranger a present why not blood.", "NTA", "No- they set this fireball in motion- and now they have to clean up the mess they created. I do suggest that you inform your Dad that their children have been led to believe he is their Grandfather and has been giving them \u2018gifts\u2019 that the kids are led to believe are coming from him. \nThey are trying to force a familial relationship onto all of you- you may have to cut all contact period since they can\u2019t seem to accept they aren\u2019t now and never were part of your family and that neither you nor your father had any responsibility toward them.", "If the kids are confused and hurt it will be because their parents LIED to them!  Why would anyone expect a man to suddenly after all these years start lavishing gifts on children who aren't related to him in any way, and with whom he has no relationship?\n\nNTA.  What a strange situation.", "I'd tell them the truth: *Our mother blew up the life we had and your births were never seen as a burden to my father. They just weren't something he could celebrate either. You don't actually know him. And so this fantasy you have of him acting like the head of the family and a great grandpa ignore the reality that he has lived. Its not a switch in his heart that anyone should expect him to flip. He rebuilt our lives from the place where things imploded. He doesn't owe anyone more than that, He acknowledges you have children. He is polite to you and your children. That has got to be more than enough for you because you are actually strangers and he is not Santa Claus.*", "I agree. NTA I really don't understand why these adult people think OP's Dad should have been there's too. With that kind of reasoning OP's spouse should be there's too, and OP's Friends and OP's Job lol.", "It comes from a belief that there are two kinds of people; on the one hand thieves and cheats, and on the other, people who are just supposed to stand there and let the world pick their pockets.", "If I were the child of a man who'd been cheated on, why would I necessarily be sympathetic to the BS claims of the cheater's kids?\n\nIf I were OP, I would be more concerned that these thugs would steal my car or rape my daughter. I would not instinctively stand there while they discussed how to steal my hair and teeth. \"Sympathy\" is not the first emotion, or second for that matter, summoned by their claims.", "If OP wants to give them presents that's OP's choice and wouldn't send mixed signals. But theu definitely should not in any imply they're from OP's dad. That isn't going to help anything and would not be doing something kind for the kids.", "I don\u2019t understand how half-siblings can view someone as a parent when they were never involved in the children\u2019s life. That\u2019s just entitlement being pushed onto the next generation.", "That's tacky.", "Yeah, that is so weird.", "I feel really bad for OP's dad. He doesn't deserve any of this.", "My 5 year old absolutely didn't remember who gave her what gift the previous Christmas. She'd say she was excited to get presents but wouldn't call out specific gift givers because what she got for Christmas when she was 4 was all a blur to her.", "Again they need to find their bio father and force him to be Grandpa because he is their actual grandpa.  You don't force a stranger to be one.  Is it sad they don't have one, yes but it isn't his job and it's no one else's either.", "I don\u2019t know what to tell you, OP mentioned twice that they don\u2019t have grand parents. Don\u2019t know it that means dead or just out of the picture.", "Why should your father take them in they are not his kids.", "NTA, your half siblings have no shame in expecting gifts from people who they are not related to. The kids have their own Grandpa.", "NTA.", "NTA.  Saying gifts come from Santa is one type of lie.  Saying gifts come from some person that you kind of know is weird and messed up.  And do these kids not go up and hug this \"grandfather\" and thank him for the gifts he got them?  I get that the gifts aren't given during the gathering but still, the kids have never mentioned a thank you to the grandfather that made him question what they were talking about?  And for the half siblings to feel that a man who isn't biologically related to them should just step up and care for them, why?  This isn't that the man married a woman with children from a previous relationship and KNEW he was going to be a stepfather.  This is a man who found out during his wife's pregnancy that the baby wasn't his and he bounced.  He was clear from the start that he wanted nothing to do with his wife's kids unless the kids were related to himself.  I feel the maternal grandparents  have some blame in the half siblings views but the half siblings are now adults.  They need to realize that OP's father is a stranger to them and he owes them nothing.", "NTA.  You are trying to calm down a situation that your half siblings are creating.  They are setting their children up for disappointment and you are refusing to enable that.  Good on you.", "NTA, but the ONLY gift you should be giving any of that part of the family is gift certificates to therapy. They're already gifting their kids generational trauma right there.", "I'm 62 and an orphan, do I get to pick out new parents and or grandparents, and do they need to be older than me? I've got my eye on some new quilting equipment.", "I blame the maternal grandparents. It sounds like they had the expectation, and raised the \u201ckids\u201d (now adults) with bitterness about it until they not only somehow think it was a reasonable expectation, but also see the lack of fulfillment of the expectation as an injustice they should try to correct through manipulation with their own children. OP\u2019s half siblings were probably led to blame OP\u2019s dad for everything that was wrong in their lives, and to think he had an obligation to step up and make amends (in the form of being grandpa, now that it\u2019s too late to be dad).\n\nI know everyone suggests therapy, but I think the half siblings would really benefit the professional help processing how unreasonable it is.", "He turned water into wine. Got you on that one. Lol", "Also don't forget, \"Think of the children\" also mindset.", "Their deadbeat dad didn't think of the children so why does anyone else", "Because it's the \"morale\" thing to do. \nI've always believed that the world would be a better place if everyone did one nice thing, but I've never told people they're ah if they don't, free will and all. Would it be great, sure, but it's not a must. I just wish humanity as a whole would pull there heads out there butts and at least be kind to one another.", "NTA \n\nFirst of all it\u2019s an ahole move to make kids expect to get any gifts. That\u2019s basically how you raise your kids to be entitled. Then you have the right to invite or not invite people into your own home. Then they\u2019re not even letting a relationship between the kids and dad to form.", "NTA.  Good for you for not enabling their behavior.  Why are your half siblings so hung up on worming their way into the lives of their half-family?  So bizarre and entitled..\n\nAlso, I wouldn\u2019t put it past them to show up at your place anyway.  You might want to make a plan for dealing with that", "NTA.  I can only assume your mother instilled in them the thought that your father should have been involved in their lives.", "NTA. Idk why grown adults are so comfortable setting up these expectations for their kids especially with people who do not consent to these relationships. Just setting their kids up for heartbreak and disappointment.", "NTA, that's dumb and cruel to their own kids!", "Wow, you half siblings are messed up in the head. They have literally been lying to their children for years. Their sense of entitlement to your father, who is no relation to them, or to their children, is really astounding. You\u2019re NTA of course. Your poor father deserves to have some peace.", "NTA. They told lies to children and expected you to be helpful in forcing others to follow their version of reality.", "NTA.\n\nYour half-siblings are out of their minds if they think any part of what they're doing is ok. They made up lies but you and your father are the bad guys for telling the truth? I feel sorry for the kids, but not because of anything you or your father have done. Their parents are doing them great harm and blaming you.", "NTA. I think you are wise to un-invite your half-siblings and their children from your Christmas.  I would probably disconnect from them even more, but I really don't like the manipulating they were doing with their children.", "NTA - your half brother is for what he\u2019s done to his children though. Setting them up for a big expectation that he knew didn\u2019t exist. They\u2019re going to be crushed and it\u2019s only his fault", "NTA.", "NTA they played themselves whole heartedly and now have to deal with it. I never understand how ppl dont find it weird as FUCK to be pretended about these relationships. Why even set the kids up for failure? I dont blame you. I'll be damned if im forced into ANY type of relationship I dont want. Their kids will be confused and hurt because their parents are LIARS.", "NTA", "Those maternal grandparents should have done a better job of raising their daughter."]}
