He can make the decisions of how to celebrate Christmas, and who to spend it with and on.\n\n>I am being told I am cruel, especially because now the kids will be so confused and hurt.\n\nOP, you didn't do this. Your half-siblings did this to their kids. *They are the ones confusing and hurting their own children.* These adults with offspring are telling their kids lies about your dad (and most likely you)... and blaming you for the outcome of that? No. That is emotional manipulation.\n\nIf I were in your place, I would do the same thing you did: uninvite those people to a Christmas gathering. They clearly don't care about you as a person. All they care about is what they could possibly get out of you and your dad.", "NTA\n\nI keep seeing crap like this, where does the notion that someone is responsible to take care of their partners affair baby keep coming from? Is this just some sort of weird by product of entitlement or something?", "NTA they're asking someone completely unconnected to them to 'step up'? Seriously?\n\nI didn't have grandparents and truthfully I don't feel hard done by, they did this to their own kids.", "NTA, your father has no responsibility to the product of his wife\u2019s affair, these kids should realize that to him they are a constant reminder of his wife\u2019s betrayal.", "NTA", "NTA. The sense of entitlement here is mind-boggling. They expect a man and they\u2019re in no way related to to step up and be a grandfather to the children his ex-wife I had with her affair partner? I mean in what world they think that your father should\u2019ve stepped up and raised them? I mean, it\u2019s absolutely ridiculous.", "Nta. Sounds like half sibling is greedy", "NTA\n\nThis is a very strange sad story. Since this started when they were preteens when your mother died I think they got the idea your dad should/would be responsible for them from somewhere. Sounds like your mom or grandparents somehow convinced them your dad would be there for them and, finding themselves without family they are trying to force it. Thats not your dads problem but you could be sympathetic, it sounds like they\u2019ve had it really rough and they are your siblings. If the kids are confused and hurt it\u2019s because their parents are not telling them the truth (for years it sounds like). Thats def not your fault. Tell them you are willing to have an honest relationship with them. Set boundaries and if they don\u2019t like it move on.", "NTA, your half siblings are attempting to manipulate you and your father into loving them and their children.  Which is quite sad when you think about it.  Their childhood sounds like it was difficult and they are probably lacking a sense of acceptance since they don\u2019t feel like they have a family foundation.  It\u2019s doubly sad that they would use their children as pawns in this manipulation. \n\nAnd while you are definitely NTA, and you should in this situation set clear boundaries that this sort of behavior is unacceptable and completely unfair to your father, it does sound like you harbor some resentment that these half siblings are even part of your life.  It\u2019s understandable that you saw the hurt your mom caused your dad and it\u2019s almost impossible not to be mad at someone for hurting your parent in that way - even if that person is your other parent.  Your mom and her actions caused a lot of pain for you, and her second family is a natural extension of that pain.  \n\nBottom line is, do what can for the kids so that they feel special and loved on Christmas, while maintaining the boundaries you need.  Your pain and anger shouldn\u2019t have to be their burden and maybe you could teach your half siblings what being their for kids looks like.", "INFO: Who is giving you shit for cutting them out? If it\u2019s your dad, then I might have a different feeling.\n\nI\u2019m thinking NTA here for the simple reason that your half-siblings have manipulated their children into already thinking your dad would take on a grandparent role with them without even confronting your dad about it. They\u2019re essentially using their kids as emotional weapons, which is super fucked up; they\u2019re the ones that will be the most hurt and disappointed over it. \n\nThat being said, I do sense some ingrained resentment towards the half-siblings in general which is maybe something to work on. It\u2019s not their fault that your mom had an affair and split up her marriage with your father. I understand being protective of your family unit you have with your father, but remember they are also your family, whether they were put there under the best circumstances or not. It sounds like they are desperate for family and aren\u2019t going about it the most healthy way. Their father split, their mother died. It sounds like you\u2019re all they have left.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
