No. That is emotional manipulation.\n\nIf I were in your place, I would do the same thing you did: uninvite those people to a Christmas gathering. They clearly don't care about you as a person.

Since this started when they were preteens when your mother died I think they got the idea your dad should/would be responsible for them from somewhere.

Thats not your dads problem but you could be sympathetic, it sounds like they\u2019ve had it really rough and they are your siblings. If the kids are confused and hurt it\u2019s because their parents are not telling them the truth (for years it sounds like). Thats def not your fault.

Their childhood sounds like it was difficult and they are probably lacking a sense of acceptance since they don\u2019t feel like they have a family foundation.  It\u2019s doubly sad that they would use their children as pawns in this manipulation. \n\nAnd while you are definitely NTA, and you should in this situation set clear boundaries that this sort of behavior is unacceptable and completely unfair to your father, it does sound like you harbor some resentment that these half siblings are even part of your life.  It\u2019s understandable that you saw the hurt your mom caused your dad and it\u2019s almost impossible not to be mad at someone for hurting your parent in that way - even if that person is your other parent.  Your mom and her actions caused a lot of pain for you, and her second family is a natural extension of that pain.  \n\nBottom line is, do what can for the kids so that they feel special and loved on Christmas, while maintaining the boundaries you need.  Your pain and anger shouldn\u2019t have to be their burden and maybe you could teach your half siblings what being their for kids looks like.", "INFO: Who is giving you shit for cutting them out? If it\u2019s your dad, then I might have a different feeling.\n\nI\u2019m thinking NTA here for the simple reason that your half-siblings have manipulated their children into already thinking your dad would take on a grandparent role with them without even confronting your dad about it. They\u2019re essentially using their kids as emotional weapons, which is super fucked up; they\u2019re the ones that will be the most hurt and disappointed over it. \n\nThat being said, I do sense some ingrained resentment towards the half-siblings in general which is maybe something to work on. It\u2019s not their fault that your mom had an affair and split up her marriage with your father. I understand being protective of your family unit you have with your father, but remember they are also your family, whether they were put there under the best circumstances or not. It sounds like they are desperate for family and aren\u2019t going about it the most healthy way. Their father split, their mother died.

Have they been good other than this, or do they expect too much from you in general?\n\nBetter to cut out this cancer now, because if you and your dad go along this year, it will just get bigger and worse.

Your dad has been very clear that he's not viewing them in a family light, so there will be a huge amount of drama when they discover that that hasn't changed (even though they've been given no indicators it would).

It wasn\u2019t his job to raise them. More should have been done to hold their dad accountable. They either don\u2019t know their mom cheated of which they are the product and just think mom got pregnant by multiple partners or they are envious of the life you had which is also not right. In either case, I don\u2019t understand the obsession they have with your father. They know he isn\u2019t their dad. You may have to have a deeper conversation with them about if they want a relationship with you that doesn\u2019t include your dad, your dad has not forgiven your mom for cheating on him, and they need to take steps to find their other grandparents.
