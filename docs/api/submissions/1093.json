At first it was no big deal, but soon our whole 4 bedroom house was humid and smelled like meat so strongly that it was making me nauseated. \n\n So I set up a box fan, pushed the smell back into the kitchen, and opened the kitchen door and blew the smell out, and lit a candle in the living room where I was. \n\n When I went to take the fan back out, my boyfriend was so mad, talking about how I don't let him eat what he wants, and that I say he can but that's not true. I never told him he couldn't eat the steak, or even how disgusted I was, I simply set up the fan and that was enough. I just wanted the humidity/smell to dissipate. \n\n Now me says I ruined his dinner, by trying to limit what he eats. That he liked forward to his steak, and i ruined it. I just can't stand the smell of cooking meat ***so strong*** that it comes through the heating vents into all rooms. He's cooked meat before, and I've never complained, but this had a lot of seasoning on it and was so strong (he was frying it in a pan on top of the stove).\n\n AITA for venting the smell/ humidity outside?

You say he can eat meat but then when he cooks meat, and a steak at that, I mean come on it's steak, even if you don't eat meat you should know what a steak means to the carnivoursious humaniods. You put a fan in the kitchen, like you made him feel like Sh!t for eating meat in his own home. You were nauseated by the smell, then go into one of the 4 bedrooms in your house and open a window, light a candle in there, but lighting a scented candle in a space were someone else is eating is just rude, smell effects how food taste. If someone does something you don't like, in a situation like this, then you go elsewhere but you don't \"fix\" the situation by doing something that passive aggressively lets them know you disapprove of what they are doing, you just suck it up or leave. \n\nAlso that is how you cook steak indoors.", "NTA - but hard to tell if this is a compatibility/ongoing issue for you both, or just a one off. \n\nFor consideration: my hubby hates the smell of fish.

I think you are wrong in the idea that you do nothing to stop him from eating it though. It sounds as if you are being passive aggressive with the windows,fans, and candles and it is creating a toxic situation. He can feel you disapproving his actions and getting angry. Even if you never say anything. This is the toxic part because you create an atmosphere where he has to conform to your ideas or he will upset you. That is not a good dynamic.

It's not like he's forcing you to eat any.", "YTA for using the fan and opening the door without talking to your boyfriend first, OP. \n\nI completely get where you're coming from with disliking the smell of the steak cooking. It's, personally, a smell I like; however, I get nauseous from the smell of bacon, breakfast sausages, or Taylor ham being cooked. There's just something about the smell those types of meat give off while being cooked that make me queasy. \n\nI'm also allergic to the smell of cinnamon red hots being boiled for one of my family recipes.

I go out, come back in hours later and I can still smell it. No joke.  I think he really did overreact by ascribing all these nefarious motives to you.
