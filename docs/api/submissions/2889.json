My girlfriend is 30, Female.\n\nThe short version is that, after repeatedly trying to ask my girlfriend to change how she uses the dishwasher, and her basically refusing, I had it hauled away (it needed replacement soon anyway if we were going to keep using it)\n\nI feel like my girlfriend is a rational, intelligent person. We have good communication generally, but everything revolving around the dishwasher has made me feel like I'm crazy just because of her reaction, and I can't imagine her acting so irrationally.\n\nShe works a lot fewer hours than I do, and does most of the housework, including the dishes. We don't have kids. Also I usually cook dinner.\n\nBut her \"doing the dishes\" means rinsing them off quickly and then putting them in the dishwasher. Just the two of us take a long time to fill up the dishwasher, so things sit in there for days and days. She puts everything in there, even things that we only have one of and use often. Spatulas, pans, tongs, things that I will need to use almost every time I cook.\n\nWhen I get home, I have to spend 10 minutes just cleaning the things that I need to cook. I have asked her to only put silverware and flatware in the dishwasher unless its going to get run that day. I've also asked her to just hand wash things completely and not even bother with the dishwasher, especially when it's just the dishes from cooking and two people eating. She just tells me this is how she washes dishes, and she can start running the dishwasher every day so that I don't have to clean things before I cook.\n\nThis felt honestly silly to me, and I don't see why the dishwasher needs to be run every day just to compensate for someone not doing dishes correctly.\n\nI asked her again to please hand wash the cooking stuff, and said it was fine to put the stuff we have like 10 of like plates and bowls and silverware into the dishwasher. She just looked at me and said \"No, I'm not going to do that. This is how I do dishes\".\n\nMy response to that was to remove it while she was at work.\n\nCurrently, she is not talking to me unless she has to, and isn't doing the dishes. I'm paying a neighbor's teenager $5 a day to come over and wash dishes when she gets home from school so that when I get home from work I can just cook. This has caused my girlfriend to say that if I paid her $5 a day, she'll go back to doing them, which really angered me, especially since this is one of the few things she has actually said to be since I got rid of the dishwasher, but I just said I'd think about it and nothing else.", "created_utc": 1669056731, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z16szn/aita_for_having_our_dishwasher_removed/", "score": 480, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But if my spouse was unhappy with the way I was doing dishes and in response removed the dishwasher I'd also stop doing dishes.\n\nWhy didn't you just let her start it every day, which would have solved the problem and kept both of you happy?", "YTA, running the dishwasher half empty uses less water than hand washing every day.  You are bizarrely controlling and you do not know how dishwashers work.", "YTA\n\n\nYou are the irrarional one.\n\n\n\n- you believe that your SO is an intelligent and rational adult\n\n\n- you believe you are an intelligent and rational adult\n\n\nBut you decided to take a shared item because she didn't follow your orders to try and force your way to her. \n\n\nWould you let her do that?

Would you wash your clothes with hands if she took the washer because she felt you miss used it? \n\n\nWho do you think gave you authority over her?", "YTA all the livelong day! Way to go nuclear. Not understanding why you wouldn't wash a couple spatulas and serving forks every day, if that's the price you pay for getting to live harmoniously with this woman who does most of the housework, and who seem (ed) to like you and love you, and who want (ed) to touch your private parts... \n\nNow you've got a gaping hole where your dishwasher used to be, at a neighbor kid costing you five dollars a day, and no love. And you have to ask if you're the asshole?", "YTA what is your issue with running the dishwasher every day? Modern dishwashers are super efficient energy and water-wise. \n\nRefusing this compromise because it feels \"silly\" and because you think she isn't doing the dishes \"correctly\" takes it from e s h to yta. You don't care about compromise or clean dishes. You care about control and things being done your way. \n\nYou proved that by removing the dishwasher to try and force her to handwash everything.", "My fiance and I have the exact same struggle.  That's why HE does the dishes.  Then he can do them exactly how he likes.  When I do the dishes/clean the kitchen, I do it how I do it.  \n\nYour gf is not your inferior or your employee.  You don't get to dictate to her how chores get done.  If you want a chore done X way and that's not how she does it, either learn to live with how she does it or do it yourself.  If she already does most of the housework, there should be ample room for you to own this chore so you can do things to your liking while keeping the overall load balanced.  \n\nBut trying to punish her for not doing things your way or trying to force her to submit to your specifications by making her life harder until she does?  Yikes.  YTA.", "**YTA**\n\nBut more than that, you're controlling, verging on abusive, and contrary to many on this sub, that's a word I don't use lightly or often.\n\nAnother commenter noted that your behaviour in removing the dishwasher without letting her know was \"passive-aggressive.\" Nope. That's not passive-aggressive, it's just aggressive. She wouldn't do things your way, so you literally REMOVED HER ABILITY TO DO THEM THE WAY SHE PREFERRED. There's nothing passive about that. What you did was deliberately antagonistic, and shockingly controlling. You left no room for discussion nor did you make any space for the possibility of her opinions mattering or her way of doing things being legitimate. This was literally \"your way or the highway\".  If I were her, the relationship would be over.\n\nThis isn't about communication anymore. It's about OP marking his territory (both the kitchen and the home in general) and informing her that there is only one \"correct\" way to do things (his), and that if she doesn't do things the \"correct\" way, he will go to extreme lengths to both punish her and force her to behave in the manner he prefers. Those are red flags you don't ignore. YTA, OP,  and you need therapy. As someone else noted very aptly, you are not a figure of authority over her, you're supposed to be her partner, and you acted like no such thing.", "yta, do it yourself or quit complaining how someone else does it. get a extra spetula if you need one while this one is in the dishwasher.", "Yta. Honestly she has already tried to compromise by putting the dishwasher on daily, which most dishwasher have a half load setting for this reason. \nTaking the dishwasher away just so she does as she's told ie doing the dishes the way you want them done just seems like a controlling behavior. She has her way of doing things and you have yours but demanding your way is the only way is asshole behaviour.", "YTA. We've done dishes like your gf for decades. They have half load or high efficiency settings for situations like this. Your way of doing dishes is inefficient and your conflict resolution skills are borderline abusive.", "If this is real, YTA. All the way, all day long, until the end of time. If you want the dishes done a certain way then do them yourself, don\u2019t treat your girlfriend like an indentured servant.", "YTA having it hauled away without warning her first comes across as very passive aggressive.\n\nYour communication and conflict resolution skills need work, having a battle of wills about who talks to the other and caves first is not an indication of a healthy or long lasting relationship.", "You had the dishwasher removed to try to \"make her do the dishes the way you want\"? Or you could... do the dishes the way that you want since this is obviously a big deal to you. Working more hours than she does doesn't mean she is your employee to direct on how to do tasks when she is at home. \n\nEven if she is being really unreasonable, just unilaterally getting rid of something your partner uses without discussion is absurd. \n\nYTA, this is at best manipulative.", "YTA. my partner and I live together and have a similar experience. as a rule, we do not put pots/pans in the dishwasher so they last longer. there are some other items that are not dishwasher safe that we don't put in. my job is to load and run the dishwasher and it's my partners job to wash the stuff that doesn't go in the dishwasher. we take turns cooking. and honestly, if I need a pot or pan that he hasn't washed yet, I just do it myself. \n\nwith that being said, I would be pissed if my partner took it upon himself to remove the dishwasher. washing dishes is the chore I despise the most. removing the dishwasher is a shitty power move and I don't blame her for not talking to you. if you don't like how she does the dishes, do it yourself. \n\nyou honestly sound silly to me. 10 minutes of inconvenience made you react this way? that's so unreasonable and idk anyone who would be ok with that happening.", "YTA. This my way or the highway attitude is terrible for your relationship. She offered a compromise, and you denied it because it meant you wouldn't get your way.", "YTA - First off. I agree with you about hand washing items like a spatula, pots, pans etc so they are ready.  However - your GF gave you a solution (run the dishwasher daily) and tried to comprise and you won't budge.  Infact you would rather pay someone else more money to come over to wash them to have your way vs finding middle ground.   You also took away the dishwasher as some sort of punishment which screams of controlling.  This is a big red flag for your girlfriend over such a petty disagreement.", "Just curious, what does she do with things that don\u2019t go/can\u2019t go in the dishwasher?", "INFO. OP do you have a my way or the highway mentality?", "YTA.  You found hand washing items you needed annoying enough to complain about it, but thought your partner should just happily do the same thing you found annoying?  And apparently still find annoying enough that you're paying a neighbor to do it instead of doing it yourself?  \n\nRunning it half full was a perfectly reasonable suggestion.", "YTA.  Log onto amazon now and order some more spatulas, tongs, etc. so you have enough side pieces to make more than 1 meal.  I have 3 spatulas just for this reason.  And removing the dishwasher with no discussion was a complete asshole, controlling move.", "YTA and controlling to boot.\n\nINFO - who owns the house? i.e. who owns the dishwasher?", "Yeah, dude, YTA here.  There's no amount of rationalization you can do here to make you look less controlling.  She came up with a compromise, but you wanted things done YOUR way.  So now, you get to be in charge of the dishes (paying the kid falls under this category).", "YTA. Your relationship sounds wonderfully petty.", "YTA sorry.   For the $5 a day you pay the neighbor to wash your dishes it would be cheaper (and more sensible) to put the dishwasher back and just run it every day even if its only 1/3 full.", "YTA. WTF? She's not doing anything wrong! AND, she's doing the majority of the housework. Which means she can do it however tf she wants. My God, dude.", "YTA and I mean to a ridiculous controlling level. Take yourself to therapy. \n\n& going to the length of exploiting a teenager  because you won't wash them to your own standard either. Its 10 mins.

Were you aware that most dishwashers nowadays actually use less water than you do washing dishes in the sink? \n\nAlso, extremely childish and borderline controling to remove the dishwasher, forcing her to hand wash the dishes. And, like most people said: if you are unhappy with how she does the dishes, wash them yourself.", "You're ripping off your neighbour's kid for one thing. And being extremely childish. Why should she spend loads of time washing dishes when you have a dishwasher. Why don't you just buy another spatula or wash it as you cook or when you're done if it bothers you that much? Removing the dishwasher was very petty and doesn't bode well for your relationship as it just shows her you'll go behind her back when you don't agree with her on something. She does most of the housework so let her do it the way that works for her. YTA.", "You sounds extremely irrational.\n\n\"My GF didn't do what I told her so I punished us both by getting rid of the dishwasher.

You said she does most of the housework\n\nYTA major", "YTA and if I was her, I'd be prepping to leave you.", "YTA it costs less money an less water to run the dishwasher every night than it does to do the dishes by hand.", "INFO: how old was the dishwasher?\n\nRunning dishwashers on half a load is usually more efficient than hand washing when it comes to water usage. And you're not even supposed to rinse the dishes before loading anymore for modern dishwashers and detergents, just scrape and load (though I find my dishwasher cannot get avocado off anything so I do rinse those dishes thoroughly but that's it).", "Petty, meet your match. \nYTA.", "YTA - do it yourself. Any wonder she is not talking to you. You have behaved like a jerk.", "Why don\u2019t you just get a modern one and put it on everyday? It will use less water and get them cleaner. Look it up if you don\u2019t believe me. Or just buy 2 sets of the cooking tools you use the most", "YTA.  You took it away while she was at work for a reason.  A discussion of this would have been the adult thing to do.  There\u2019s also no reason why her suggestion of running it every day would not work.

Problem literally solved lmao.", "LMAO....YTA.\n\nYou are being a bit irrational here. *She's not doing dishes correctly*. Meaning the way YOU want them done. She offered to run mini loads and you noped right out of that. \n\nYes, YTA for removing the dishwasher and not telling her why.\n\nAlso, not unreasonable to ask that items you use daily to be washed, but can't you do them? \n\nJust pay the kiddo to get keep doing the dishes for $5 a day. It's a win win for for everyone.", "YTA I don't agree with your position on not running it daily, but I can understand it. What I don't get is how you think removing the unbroken dishwasher was the logical next step and how she is being \"irrational\" while you are not.\n\nCompromise be doing the hand dishes yourself or running it daily.", "The fact that you won't handwash the dishes either says plenty. YTA.", "YTA - just got to the dollar store and buy a few spatulas and tongs. Pay $6 one time instead of $5 daily. And running a full dishwasher can actually save water. It\u2019s a weird bill to die on BEFORE you unilaterally removed a shared appliance.", "YTA. She literally offered a reasonable compromise and you shut it down because you think it's \"silly\". What's silly is paying a neighbor $5/day to do the dishes that your gf was already doing for free.. That's weird logic dude. \n\nAdditionally, dishes are honestly one of the worst chores because who tf wants to touch wet food... She does them in a way that allows her to minimize the grossest part of the job (by using a dishwasher) AND she offered to do it for you daily so that you can have what you need when you need it. \n\nYou didn't like her solution to the problem and decided that the nuclear option was the way to go, like I wouldn't speak to you either, dude, you removed an entire appliance from your home just to be petty! How much effort did that even take, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say way too much, I mean it seems like you took off work to make this happen, lol. If I came home to that I'd be like are you ok, bc you definitely do not seem ok lol...

He\u2019d take the kids to school/daycare on his way to work. There was never a point where he felt I was less than him and I needed to do as he said. That\u2019s because we are partners. We help each other. Now, he is still working more than I am, but I am carrying the insurance for our family. He still drops the kids off and I pick them up.

Who does what isn't really important so long as we are both contributing and pulling our weight.   Just because you're supporting her financially doesn't make her your maid.  That's a trade off.

If you want her to do less housework because you don't like how she does it, then you talk to her about rebalancing that load.  Maybe she works more so she contributes more financially instead of contributing at home. Maybe she'd rather split the cooking.  \n\nBut that's neither here nor there.  What makes you TA is how you handled it.  It should have been a *discussion*.
