I felt really angry at the time because she knew exactly why I booked this holiday and the nature of it being a romantic getaway. She didn't even tell me she was coming, she just turned up. To make matters worse, she's come with a random friend that nor my partner and I do not know. It would've been a different situation if both of our mums came to surprise us together.

I agree that you should make yourself unavailable to your mom for the duration of your romantic couple's trip. She's ALREADY put a damper on it and given you stress by calling you with her unimaginably self centered decision to latch onto your trip on the sly. Don't let her take any more of your time, attention or energy until you are home and ready to discuss her violating your privacy as a couple. She's taught you she needs an info diet- restricting what details about your personal life and relationship she is told.

OP should not meet with his mom the entire trip. That would be rewarding her for her bad behavior.

OP needs to clearly establish boundaries now, or his mom will try invade all future plans, the wedding, buying a house, raising their children.", "Thanks for your comment but I don't know why it's so out of the realm to borrow some money off your family members?
