Hence, I have a very slight accent when speaking English, but I really doubt it\u2019s noticeable enough.\n\nOne of my roommates had his girlfriend (white) over for dinner the other night. His dinner plans included rice (we both have rice cookers) and he asked me how to make good rice while I was making my own dinner. He didn\u2019t ask me because I was Asian\u2014he asked me because I knew how to cook and he\u2019s seen me cooking dozens of times. Regardless, I told him how to use a rice cooker like Asians do: wash the rice a few times, throw away the measuring cup, and use the first joint of your finger to determine the water level. I did all that in an exaggerated Asian accent, specifically modeled after Nigel Ng\u2019s Uncle Roger persona, to reinforce the point and that I was not bullshitting him. After I finished teaching him, I switched back to my regular voice.\n\nApparently, his girlfriend took offense to this. She (white, need I remind you) said that I was perpetuating stereotypes and that I shouldn\u2019t be using an accent since it just reinforces the stereotype. I, in no uncertain terms, told her to mind her own business and that I get to use the accent if I\u2019m getting an Asian-centric point across as an Asian. I also told her that it was like telling black people to stop using the N word\u2014if it\u2019s their thing, they get to use it how they please.\n\nSo, AITA for using an Asian accent while Asian?\n\nThrowaway because I want to keep my main down low.\n\nEDIT: So this is what people mean when they say \u201cRIP inbox.\u201d\n\nEDIT: And this is the point where I turn off inbox replies.\n\nEDIT: \u2026this post is going to make it onto Instagram, isn\u2019t it?", "created_utc": 1682121868, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12unper/aita_for_using_an_asian_accent_to_show_my/", "score": 2504, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
