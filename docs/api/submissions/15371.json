Regardless, I told him how to use a rice cooker like Asians do: wash the rice a few times, throw away the measuring cup, and use the first joint of your finger to determine the water level. I did all that in an exaggerated Asian accent, specifically modeled after Nigel Ng\u2019s Uncle Roger persona, to reinforce the point and that I was not bullshitting him. After I finished teaching him, I switched back to my regular voice.\n\nApparently, his girlfriend took offense to this. She (white, need I remind you) said that I was perpetuating stereotypes and that I shouldn\u2019t be using an accent since it just reinforces the stereotype.
