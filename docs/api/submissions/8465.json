My mom works a 9-5 at her own vet clinic and is usually exhausted when she gets home from work. My dad works 24 hour shifts a couple times a week, and does renovations on our home all day on his days off. Because of this my parents will ask me to make dinner for my younger siblings whenever they\u2019re busy. My brothers have hockey, volley ball and basketball pretty much every night and eat dinner as soon as they get home from school (4:30). I have no problems cooking dinner because it helps my parents out and keeps my siblings fed. The other night I started making dinner when my mom got home early, and offered to take over. I went up to my room to study. After about an hour I wandered downstairs to see if supper was ready. My sister told me they all ate and just didn\u2019t tell me. There was no food left over. Since then, every time my parents ask me to make dinner, I\u2019ll either only make enough for myself or I make it and just don\u2019t tell them it\u2019s ready, so they have to eat it cold/microwaved. This has been pissing my parents off, and I told them I\u2019d stop when they all apologize for not telling me dinner was ready. It\u2019s seems petty, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much for them to just apologize and admit that they were being assholes for just refusing to tell me. \n\nAm I being petty and dramatic?

At 15 and 13 these kids are more than capable of making their own dinner, as are your parents. They showed you how much they appreciated your efforts, so now just take care of yourself", "NtA.  You want to feel appreciated. What they did made you feel hurt and used. You're also their child, not the help.", "NTA. You agreed to help out your parents so you cook for your siblings when they aren't home and tell them when food is ready like a normal person.\n\nYour mum comes home early one day and sais she'll take over the cooking and nobody tells you food is ready. That's nice of them.\n\nYou still continue to cook for them but you don't tell them it's ready. You just did what they did.\n\nThese aren't infants. One is 13 and the other 15. They should both be helping you in the kitchen in one form or another. What are they gonna do if you aren't home and your parents are still at work, Just look at the oven?", "NTA.

The oldest child & the youngest auntie/uncle being unpaid help has been going on forever.\n\nAs a latch key kid in the 90s, my mom either cooked & left me food to heat up, got me microwavable food & when I was 13, I was allowed to use the stove.

I don't think the issue is just that they didn't tell you when dinner was ready, it's also that they didn't even save any food for you, like you didn't matter at all. THAT would sting anybody, including them. If THEY are getting pissed off when YOU do it, then they should realize how hurt you were when THEY did it--and apologize.", "NTA there's food in the house and your siblings are old enough to use the microwave and stove. At their ages they should be taking turns or working together to make simple meals.\n\nAs for your parents I suspect they're accustomed to you being a mini parent when they're busy. It's great that you help out but they're taking your labour for granted. They owe you a huge thank you and an apology.", "NTA\n\nIt isn't unreasonable to expect at least an apology for leaving you without food on a night that you did some of the cooking.  \n\nIf they do apologize and this isn't a pattern, then hopefully that can be enough to go back to normal, but I don't think it's petty to hold out for them to at least acknowledge the harm done and express some apologies.", "Did they explain why they excluded you? Was it an out of sight out of mind situation? Or does this happen alot in other situations too?", "It is not petty, they were rude to you", "NTA. If it was a mistake they should have no problem apologizing. Why on earth didn\u2019t they??? Are they super selfish? Are you the black sheep?

There wouldn't be a problem if you guys communicated like normal people. Yes, they should admit they did you wrong and give you an apology. But doing the exact same thing back also requires you to admit you're wrong for reacting this poorly. Now you're all just at the point no ones willing to swallow their pride. I would try to have a proper discussion at this point, about what's expected when someone makes dinner and disclose that it's for everyone and when it's ready. If no one can apologize then at least come to an agreement.", "ESH they should have told you that dinner was ready but you are acting petty and going back on your agreement to cook dinner.", "ESH. Your parents are treating you more like hired help than their child if they somehow forget you\u2019re expected to be fed when they make or buy food for the family. That being said, your petty vengeance has gone on longer than one would think reasonable.

I get that you are upset that they didn't call you down or leave you any dinner once, unless I'm mistaken and it's a pattern. If this is correct, the one time they did this, you held a grudge, you're going to be holding a lot of grudges in adulthood. That will be a lot of baggage.\n\nYour siblings are teens, you're technically an adult, and they're busy working full time. You do not pay rent, unless this is an omission, and you do not contribute to groceries. While you feel upset, I get it, you're helping out in exchange for room and board. You could be living in dorms, paying a student loan, but you're at home.\n\nI don't think passive-aggression is a good way to handle conflict, and it will lead to problems down the line with other people. Furthermore, you're upsetting your parents with this hill to die on that really is nothing in the scheme of things, and when you need your parents, if they hold a grudge over this behavior, it'll backfire on you.", "Look I think you are upset about something bigger.

What actual family makes a meal, does not let everyone know to come to the table, and eats ever bit of the meal so one not-notified family member goes hungry?  They are A Hs, not OP.", "It's really effing weird that your mother didn't bother to tell you dinner was ready.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA\n\nWhat throws me the most is that they not only ate without you, but they also didn't leave you any!\nDid they just forget you were in the house? Did they think you had gone out to eat?\nLike, you started cooking, your Mum took over, I'm guessing you told her you were going to go study, and what? Everyone just forgot about you?\n\nThat's rough, and yeah, maybe you're being a little petty with refusing to cook until they apologise, but they did appear to completely forget about you and left you nothing to eat. How an 'oh, sh*t, we mucked up, we're so sorry' wasn't the first thing out any of their mouths, sort of breaks my brain.", "NTA. You may not be able to do this forever, but you can do it long enough to make a point.\n\nI mean, lapses in communication happen in every family. There have been times when I didn't call someone to dinner because I thought they were out. Even then, I've apologized and tried to help them find something to eat.\n\nThey need to remember that you need sustenance, too.", "How do they not know when dinner is ready so they have to microwave it, does nobody give you any help?\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA \n\nWhilst it might seem petty, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re asking for a lot. A simple \u201cyeah sorry, it was incredibly rude of us to 1) not tell you dinner was ready and 2) not save you any when you didn\u2019t show up at the table. We\u2019ll do better next time\u201d \n\nIf they don\u2019t appreciate you enough to include you in meals when one of them cooks, then why should they expect you to include them in meals when you cook.

Totally not fair. Now unfortunately, they have gotten use to you doing this hence why they're so irate and won't apologize.", "NTA. It IS petty what you're doing but... sometimes people need to be taught a lesson in a petty way and doing it this way shows them how you felt when they did it to you. It wasn't right what they did and they owe you an apology.", "You are being petty and dramatic but your willingness to help out is admirable - so NTA", "INFO:  What on Earth could have motivated them to exclude OP from that dinner? Is there some simmering conflict that OP doesn't mention in the story?", "NTA. They are taking you for granted. How do you forget about the person who makes dinner 99% of the time? I'd do worse. I'd sort my dinner out only. Petty LaBelle", "Sounds like turn about is fair play here. Lesson needs to be learned", "ESH along with NTA.  They did it once and yet you keep doing it.  But they shouldn't have done it in the first place and apologizing doesn't take much effort on their side.  I'd keep it up if I were you until they apologize.  They apparently don't mind if they haven't apologized yet.", "It's not petty.\n\nThere was a system where OP would cook for everyone on a regular basis and everyone would eat the food on a regular basis. Then everyone else decided that they all would eat but OP would not. So the system is broken, the deal is off, and there's no need to restart it if the people broke it can't come to terms with their own failure.", "Well, yes, but at 19 they don\u2019t have to provide OP with free housing and food either. Was eating all the food and not leaving some for a family member a dick move? Yes, totally. But refusing to make one of your only contributions to the running of the household as a result is childish. ESH", "Right? Did they not notice her empty seat at the table? And nobody thought to save her any? Even if I somehow forgot to call my kid to dinner AND didn\u2019t think to save him any, the VERY least I would do is fall all over myself apologizing. WTF?!", "Right?!!", "DUDE ALL THE PARENTS HAVE TO DI IS APOLOGIZE. SAY SORRY AND MOVE ON", "My guess is that she\u2019s at least as upset that no one took responsibility for the screw up and no one apologized. One time or twenty, doesn\u2019t matter. Apologize.", "This has nothing to do with that. Even if parents are buying food, is OP being paid for ether labor?", "That's the thing. You make dinner frequently (probably multiple times a week from what it sounds like) to help out your family. Cooking is a lot of time and effort. It takes literally 3 seconds to shout \"u/ plzhelp, dinner's ready!\" for a meal that took a minimum of a half hour to prepare. Don't budge until your entire family apologizes.", "Talking to the sister is not the same as talking to the parents. Younger siblings can be irresponsible brats. I want to know what OP\u2019s parents, as the adults responsible, had to say if OP talked to them about this.", "I\u2019m saying, if her form of retaliation is wasting the food they bought.", "Well considering OP was making dinner the parents knew they were hungry. OP always has to cook for the younger siblings. Mom saw OP cooking and took over and then chose not to call OP for supper and chose not to speak up when OP asked why they weren't called for dinner. We don't know if the younger siblings are brats or not, their answer certainly didn't scream 'brat' to me\n\nIdk abt you but to me it seems the parents don't give a shit abt OP. OP is usually 'the one responsible' so they just unilaterally decided not to feed OP.\n\nOP also stated the parents are aware of the problem bc theyre no longer cooking for everyone or calling anyone for dinner. They're not stupid, they know they fucked up and hurt OP, they just don't care", "How? She\u2019s not making a pound of spaghetti and throwing it out.", "You seem to be attacking on the assumption that I\u2019ve concluded OP is wrong. What I want to know, as I\u2019ve clearly expressed, is what the parents of the children said to OP regarding this. You can keep jumping to whatever conclusions you want about why I\u2019ve requested more information, though."]}
