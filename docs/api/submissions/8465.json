{"id": 8465, "submission_id": "10mz0eh", "title": "AITA for refusing to make dinner after my brothers and sister ate without telling me?", "selftext": "So I (19F) am a college student living with my parents, brothers (13M) and sister (15F). My mom works a 9-5 at her own vet clinic and is usually exhausted when she gets home from work. My dad works 24 hour shifts a couple times a week, and does renovations on our home all day on his days off. Because of this my parents will ask me to make dinner for my younger siblings whenever they\u2019re busy. My brothers have hockey, volley ball and basketball pretty much every night and eat dinner as soon as they get home from school (4:30). I have no problems cooking dinner because it helps my parents out and keeps my siblings fed. The other night I started making dinner when my mom got home early, and offered to take over. I went up to my room to study. After about an hour I wandered downstairs to see if supper was ready. My sister told me they all ate and just didn\u2019t tell me. There was no food left over. Since then, every time my parents ask me to make dinner, I\u2019ll either only make enough for myself or I make it and just don\u2019t tell them it\u2019s ready, so they have to eat it cold/microwaved. This has been pissing my parents off, and I told them I\u2019d stop when they all apologize for not telling me dinner was ready. It\u2019s seems petty, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much for them to just apologize and admit that they were being assholes for just refusing to tell me. \n\nAm I being petty and dramatic?

How rude of them not to leave you any dinner of the meal you started!\n\nEDIT: for those people commenting that it's petty - yes it is- but all the family has to do is apologize for taking OP for granted and this will be over. The length of time this goes on is all on them.", "NTA- you,without complaint, make dinner for them and this is how they show their appreciation?  Hold your ground.  At 15 and 13 these kids are more than capable of making their own dinner, as are your parents. They showed you how much they appreciated your efforts, so now just take care of yourself", "NtA.  You want to feel appreciated. What they did made you feel hurt and used. You're also their child, not the help.", "NTA. You agreed to help out your parents so you cook for your siblings when they aren't home and tell them when food is ready like a normal person.\n\nYour mum comes home early one day and sais she'll take over the cooking and nobody tells you food is ready. That's nice of them.\n\nYou still continue to cook for them but you don't tell them it's ready. You just did what they did.\n\nThese aren't infants. One is 13 and the other 15. They should both be helping you in the kitchen in one form or another. What are they gonna do if you aren't home and your parents are still at work, Just look at the oven?", "NTA. You deserve an apology if all they can say is \"I don't know\". Pls add the info to your main post.", "INFO: Did you tell them you wanted an apology and they refused to give you one? Or did you just start the petty behaviour immediately and then blew up on them when they said what you're doing is rude?", "NTA. How do you forget to tell someone a meal is ready or at least not leave any. Honestly the assholes here to me are the parents. It's ultimately their responsibility to make sure kids are fed. The oldest child & the youngest auntie/uncle being unpaid help has been going on forever.\n\nAs a latch key kid in the 90s, my mom either cooked & left me food to heat up, got me microwavable food & when I was 13, I was allowed to use the stove. At 13 & 15, they're old enough to make their own food.", "INFO: Did you directly address this with your parents at the time? Like, \u201cHey, why didn\u2019t anyone call me for dinner?\u201d", "NTA. I don't think the issue is just that they didn't tell you when dinner was ready, it's also that they didn't even save any food for you, like you didn't matter at all. THAT would sting anybody, including them. If THEY are getting pissed off when YOU do it, then they should realize how hurt you were when THEY did it--and apologize.", "NTA there's food in the house and your siblings are old enough to use the microwave and stove. At their ages they should be taking turns or working together to make simple meals.\n\nAs for your parents I suspect they're accustomed to you being a mini parent when they're busy. It's great that you help out but they're taking your labour for granted. They owe you a huge thank you and an apology.", "NTA\n\nIt isn't unreasonable to expect at least an apology for leaving you without food on a night that you did some of the cooking.  \n\nIf they do apologize and this isn't a pattern, then hopefully that can be enough to go back to normal, but I don't think it's petty to hold out for them to at least acknowledge the harm done and express some apologies.", "Did they explain why they excluded you? Was it an out of sight out of mind situation? Or does this happen alot in other situations too?", "It is not petty, they were rude to you", "NTA. If it was a mistake they should have no problem apologizing. Why on earth didn\u2019t they??? Are they super selfish? Are you the black sheep? Anyway, definitely NTA", "NTA You\u2019re being just the right amount of petty. Sounds like they\u2019re taking your cooperation for granted. It\u2019s an easy fix for them, and you\u2019re reasonable to ask it.", "NTA. They havent learned their lesson yet. Keep teaching it.", "ESH. There wouldn't be a problem if you guys communicated like normal people. Yes, they should admit they did you wrong and give you an apology. But doing the exact same thing back also requires you to admit you're wrong for reacting this poorly. Now you're all just at the point no ones willing to swallow their pride. I would try to have a proper discussion at this point, about what's expected when someone makes dinner and disclose that it's for everyone and when it's ready. If no one can apologize then at least come to an agreement.", "ESH they should have told you that dinner was ready but you are acting petty and going back on your agreement to cook dinner.", "ESH. Your parents are treating you more like hired help than their child if they somehow forget you\u2019re expected to be fed when they make or buy food for the family. That being said, your petty vengeance has gone on longer than one would think reasonable. Stop making dinner for them if you don\u2019t want to do it, but no need to play games that leave everyone miserable.", "NTA. Why didn't they tell you dinner was ready. They had to have noticed you were not there and on top of it they didn't save you any", "YTA.\n\nThis is immature OP. You\u2019re the oldest, act like it. Yeah, them not telling you if food was ready or not was wrong but two wrongs don\u2019t make a right.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
