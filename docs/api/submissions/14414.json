I am planning a night out to take my family out to dinner so they can finally meet her in person. My family is small. I only have my maternal and paternal grandparents, my parents and my sister.

I'm not inviting my sister to the introduction dinner and that's causing an argument with my sister and our parents have sided with her. My fianc\u00e9e is a pathologist.

Not only is most of it confidential but it's also not pleasant. She rarely tells me anything about it and if she does it's in the abstract and not in detail. I understand this and have no problem with it. My sister talks about it constantly. Sometimes I have to ignore her or end the video call because she won't stop no matter what I say. She has told her friends who share her hobby about her association with my fianc\u00e9e and I don't like that.\n\nI don't trust her not to bring it up at dinner. My fianc\u00e9e would be uncomfortable and even if she did want to talk about it (she wouldn't) it's not an appropriate subject for a dinner. My fianc\u00e9e regularly sees the worst of society and it's not a fun or entertaining subject but my sister treats it like it is. None of us want to hear about the crimes, victims and criminals, especially my fianc\u00e9e. My sister can't be trusted to keep her hobby to herself so I don't want her there and I'm not even sure I'll introduce her to my fianc\u00e9e at this point. Me and my fianc\u00e9e are paying for the dinner. My fianc\u00e9e says she doesn't want to be around my sister if she would bring up her job. I'm respecting her wishes. My sister feels angry and excluded and really wants to meet her. But she will not promise to behave and I'm being made out to be an asshole for not inviting her to the dinner.

Make sure everyone is aware of this so if it goes poorly they all know exactly why it went poorly and who is to blame for it. You sister is old enough to to be a fully accountable for her actions. I had a similar situation with an alcoholic (in recovery) family member that insisted me and my partner at the time visited them while we were traveling. It\u2019s about all you can do if you really want to appease your family with the situation.", "I think they're shutting the sister down all the time. Op says it already in the next. Most things are top secret, then it's depressing and the wife doesn't want to talk about it, they shut her down on video calls etc too. It's not just the dinner it's an ongoing thing, which is still valid. The fiance is allowed to have boundaries, but i get the sisters frustrations too. It's her passion. OP IS NTA", "If I remember right the K-pop fan was a child, but this OP's sister is 28... Still acting like a kid though.", "INFO: How would your grandparents react to your sister bringing up such an inappropriate topic during dinner? Is there any way you could give them a heads up on the issue and get them to make her behave? I don't know your family dynamic, but I know in a lot of families, grandparents have that power. NTA either way, though.", "Is there any subject you know of that your parents or sister absolutely would never want to discuss with anyone? Maybe something extremely personal or just a universal taboo topic? If so, ask them how they'd feel if someone insisted on bringing that topic up with them, or, if they still don't understand, actually do it. Have a conversation where all you want to talk about with them is this thing they most want to avoid discussing. Maybe they'll get the picture.", " I have a job similar to your fianc\u00e9es and I also truly hate being asked questions about my cases as if they\u2019re fodder for entertainment and not real people.", "People have the right to ask questions and be informed. This isn't just about entertainment. It's about learning, police work, staying safe by understanding, seeing were mistakes have been made and many other reasons. One of my reasons is, I am an author. If i write horror or Thriller I have to seek information (i always respect other people's boundaries tho. If someone says they don't want to talk about it, it's okay)\n\nIt's not okay to harass you during your free time or ruining dinner for you. I see why it makes you uncomfortable, especially when it comes to top secret information, but it's also not okay to judge people who are interested in crimes/cases for very different reasons.", "Your sister has a creepy hobby", "Yeah. I think it might help your sister if you sit down one on one and explain this to her in really frank terms. Honestly, be as possible in a way that doesn't throw your fiancee under the bus. Your sister talking about your fiancee with her true crime friends could tank cases and destroy your fianc\u00e9e's career. Just some examples: Tell your sister that she's allowed to have her hobby, but make it clear that doesn't mean you're not kind of disgusted by it. Tell her your fianc\u00e9e doesn't even talk about it with you, but that you've seen her break down after a really hard day, and after seeing that, it's hard to not be horrified when people talk about it as if it's a reality show. Tell her that you're honestly offended that she would use your relationship to clout chase with her friends."]}
