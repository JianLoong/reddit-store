You explicitly say that you need to parent your spouse. Don't do that. I assume you're marrying an adult, and not a child. If you're marrying an adult, you should treat them like an adult.

You can tell them it means a lot to you because of your fear of cancer, but ultimately, it's up to them. You have to make the choice of whether what that person does is a deal breaker for you. A parent/child type relationship rarely ever lasts as one will be frustrated with one's stupidity and child like behaviour, the other will be frustrated being told what to do. \n\nWholly agree it was stupid and careless of them, also incredibly annoying that they'll be red in the photos.

I absolutely understand that skin cancer runs in your family and that makes you much more cognizant of sunscreen as a result (very understandably so), but at some point you have to accept that you cannot control what your partner does and should not try. \n\nYou cannot spend your life chasing after your partner with the sunscreen bottle.
