You explicitly say that you need to parent your spouse. Don't do that. I assume you're marrying an adult, and not a child. If you're marrying an adult, you should treat them like an adult.

But if they refuse, then you need to let it go.\n\nNagging someone to do something they don't want to do is NEVER a successful way to change behaviors. In fact, it very often makes people dig their heels in even harder, because no one likes being \"parented\" by the person who is supposed to be their equal partner. \n\nRecognize that you can't control another person's behavior, and that trying to is a surefire relationship killer.

Look up images of what happens when skin cancer DOESN'T go away and you'd understand far more quickly that this doesn't start and end with bad photos. Especially because OP stated herself that first and foremost the concern is illness from this type of negligence. I've watched relatives die from what people here would shrug and consider \"light hearted\" cancers. It's nothing to take lightly. I'm sorry that this runs in your family and yet your partner can't take their own health seriously without you running circles around them OP.\n\nLet's break it down for the people who want to deem you an AH because you didn't hide how upset this made you:\n\n* they were BEET red. I may not be the highest tier professional with Photoshop, but I have worked in Adobe (mainly PS) since 2015 in commissioned editing work. Often times FOR wedding and engagement shoots for photographers on the \"lower end\" of the price spectrum. As in, hobbyists who want to break out into the profession and charge less so they can offload this chunk of labor that they know next to nothing about to somebody who also doesn't charge an arm and a leg (me) but rather just the arm so they can keep the leg. The only way I can see it happening where each and every single one of these people's skin tones can be corrected accurately is if there were already professional quality photos taken off a similar camera in incredibly similar lighting BEFORE this happened. If you don't have a baseline to how the color is supposed to be, you can certainly try to do it by eye, it likely won't be as accurate but it MIGHT work out. But again, y'all are deeming OP an AH because of a lot of maybes and assumptions in your end on just how far PS can cover up this type of \"mistake.\" Also do y'all have ANY idea just how expensive that type of editing work on EVERY SINGLE photo is going to be? That's likely an upcharge by at least 1k depending on the photographer/editor, even if all they're doing is selecting your partner out and sliding the saturation scale (which won't look good if it just starts and ends there). They may even have to hire a new, more experienced one depending on the one they have now. So possibly thousands of dollars are going to be sunk into getting a presentable photo by everyone's standards that could have been prevented by simply putting on/spraying on some sunscreen a couple more times in the day!!! It's INSANITY to claim that OP is an AH to be upset over such a severe level of negligence on what is supposed to be the presently most important day of their lives as individuals and as a couple. Not to mention any visible skin peeling is also going to take added work and won't look great if it's a slap dash job on each photo. It'll look better, sure, but it's still going to cost a lot more even with a slap dash job. We're looking at possibly 15-20 added minutes on each photo you want to look nice for the quickest of jobs on these photos and that's going to add up to a costly degree. \n* again skin cancer runs in OP's family. For all the people going \"well you know who you're marrying,\" how does that **not** also apply to the beet red partner here too?! They are ALSO aware that this is ALWAYS going to be an important point of address for their partner, and yet they couldn't be bothered to address it in preparation for what is one of their most important days as a couple ever?? Why in the world is OP supposed to be accepting of this yet is undeserving of any acceptance on their part? Literally every dermatologist worth their license is going to stand behind OP that you can't allow yourself to get burned like that under a harsh sun if you don't want to play with the risks of skin cancer. Which, again, is not nearly as light hearted of a cancer as some may want to believe.\n* Who is going to look after these people when they are in pain from sunburns now? Have y'all ever been sunburned like this? I have. I have burned to a beet red crisp before when I was a child and I never allowed it to get to that point ever again because it was THAT painful. I could barely feel my skin touching my own skin without it hurting so badly. Who do y'all think is going to have to address the pain OP's partner is going to be in a few hours/few days from now if not OP? Why exactly should OP just suck it up and be super duper happy with living with the negligence of her partner that she desperately wanted to prevent? How is OP's partner going to get into a tux/dress on their own if their burn is this bad? How are they going to move freely without experiencing pain? How is the kiss during the ceremony going to go smoothly? Who's going to have to run out and keep buying aloe for them to mitigate some level of pain here? What if your partner's skin is a peeling gnarly mess the day of the wedding day?\n* This was clearly NO accident. An accident is losing the sunscreen and having to go to the store to buy more. An accident is spraying sunscreen in your eyes. An accident is not simply choosing not to put on sunscreen over the course of 9 hours when you have a wedding coming up.\n\n*This one is for you OP:* if y'all have ever talked about children, what is that going to look like? Skin cancer does run in your family. What if they start getting frequent sunburns at an early age? What kind of breakdown in communication and union is that going to cause? Your kid goes out for a 9 hour day with them at the beach and comes back looking like a beet and then what? You don't trust your partner to take them out without your supervision for 9 hours during a sunny day and then what? Is your partner going to claim you're over dramatic for taking them to the dermatologist to inspect new freckles and moles? You need to start thinking about what this means for y'all's relationship ASAP if your partner can't even be bothered to look after themselves in a matter that is very important to you. There is validity in the statement that 'you know who you're marrying,' but that goes both ways. This is obviously never going to stop being a major need for you, and for valid reasons no less, it's time to have a difficult talk about how this is going to severely impact your relationship with your partner if a change doesn't happen.", "At this point you\u2019ve known for a while that your partner doesn\u2019t care about applying sunscreen, so the options are either A) spend your marriage parenting your spouse or B) understand that they\u2019re an adult and that, at the end of the day, if they want to risk cancer it\u2019s their choice. There would be option C of letting go of this relationship if you didn\u2019t feel like being with a partner who disregards this concern and who might get a serious condition you would need to help with in the future, but as you\u2019ve decided to marry this person already knowing about this aspect of their personality I\u2019m guessing this isn\u2019t actually a dealbreaker for you.\n\nETA to add that I think this is a case of NTA; OP has this concern, future spouse doesn\u2019t, they\u2019re clashing about it.
