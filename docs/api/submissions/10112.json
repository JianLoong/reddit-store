You explicitly say that you need to parent your spouse. Don't do that. I assume you're marrying an adult, and not a child. If you're marrying an adult, you should treat them like an adult.

You don't \"have to\" parent your spouse and you don't \"have to baby them.\" You choose to do it, and it's super unhealthy for both of you and will eventually destroy your relationship.\n\nYour partner is an adult and gets to decide how to treat their own body and what risks they are willing to take with it. You can express how scared that makes you feel. You can ask them (once...maybe twice) to change their behavior. But if they refuse, then you need to let it go.\n\nNagging someone to do something they don't want to do is NEVER a successful way to change behaviors. In fact, it very often makes people dig their heels in even harder, because no one likes being \"parented\" by the person who is supposed to be their equal partner. \n\nRecognize that you can't control another person's behavior, and that trying to is a surefire relationship killer. Now, if your anxiety about this is unbearable, or you find you don't respect them for their poor choices, it's time to move on and find a relationship with someone who shares your values more closely.
