You explicitly say that you need to parent your spouse. Don't do that. I assume you're marrying an adult, and not a child. If you're marrying an adult, you should treat them like an adult.

I'm guessing you both spent quite a lot of time, effort, and money planning for this wedding, especially on a photographer. Yes, some things can be Photoshopped, but that also costs money on top of what is probably already a hefty expense. It was thoughtless and careless of your partner to go out and do that to themselves three days before your wedding, and I hope they take your feelings into better consideration in other parts of your relationship. Ignoring things you feel strongly about shouldn't be par for the course, and reminds me very much of [this article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/she-divorced-me-i-left-dishes-by-the-sink_b_9055288).

Good luck.", "If you are getting to the point where you make your partner cry over something like this, YTA.\n\nI am also a sunscreen obsessive, I wear it daily even in the rain. I do understand that. But one burn is not going to cause cancer. Depending on the sunscreen and application method it's common for sunburn to occur even when people do reapply.

Not only will they be red in the wedding pictures, but they could possibly be in pain and pealing as well. They were irresponsible and should accept that they were wrong.", "NTA.  Totally understand being frustrated but there are things you can do.  Have them take a bath with a bunch of black tea bags in the bath water.  Slather them with pure aloe vera gel multiple times a day and they should stay out of the sun entirely.  Get some hydrocolloid patches and put them on their face overnight to speed healing.  Morning of the wedding, do some gentle exfoliation with an exfoliating cleanser to remove dead skin.  They may need to peel some flakes off their face with tweezers (not ideal for healing but the dead skin will look bad in pictures) or just using a wet washcloth.  Then slather on some rich moisturizer and use concealer and foundation to cover.  Mixing the foundation into the moisturizer will give more natural-looking coverage.  You can use it on their body too and set with a powder, this can easily be purchased from a drug store.  I don't care if they are male or don't normally wear makeup, it is what will save the pictures and shouldn't be noticeable.  A little bit of matte bronzer (or a darker colored powder) on the cheekbones will keep it from looking weird and mask-like.  I would use a tiny bit of blush too if you do full-coverage makeup.  Good luck!", "Just let it go. In the big scheme of things this is not worth starting a fight over. In time it might become a beloved family story.", "NTA but are you sure you want to marry a child?

It was a nasty combination of being outside helping set up and not realizing how much time had passed before reapplying. \n\nThe make up artist had me put my dress on before covering my chest, shoulders, and back in make up, completely hiding the sunburn. Any makeup that might have faded during the day to reveal a sunburn was edited out and you can\u2019t tell in any pics. In fact, no one even noticed I was sunburned until I explained why I wasn\u2019t drinking. \n\nIt\u2019s okay to be upset, but to argue with them until they cry is an overreaction.

You will NOT have ruined photos, I promise.\n\nIt might turn into a funny story eventually. When my folks got married (long before photoshop) my grandpa managed to give himself a black eye days before their wedding. Grandma thought she'd fix it by using her foundation to cover it up. Unfortunately, their skin tones were nothing alike *and* you could still see the bruise. So Grandpa looks pretty ridiculous in all of the photos. But he's been gone now for nearly 5 years and my folks still tell that story sometimes. Everyone laughs and I like to think Grandpa would appreciate us remembering him fondly.", "If they spend from now until the wedding slathered in aloe then it still might fade pretty well.  Keep the skin moist and don't let it dry out - just constant aloe. The good, sticky green kind and not the lotions with aloe.  Its unpleasant as hell to do, which is why most people don't, but for a wedding you might as well try.\n\nAlso - it's last minute but if you can find someone that does airbrush makeup then you can cover the while thing up super well.  They will have to be careful not to rub it day of - but again when you are getting married why not try.", "I'll hop on to say: three days gives you time to heal it. they need to chug water like it's their job. moisturize the skin, possibly some hyaluronic acid. if all goes well, that burn will ease into a tan.", "Buy and apply green makeup primer!", "Yeah, they can definitely fix the photos after. My sunscreen failed the day before senior photos.
