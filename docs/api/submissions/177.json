You were polite and gave her multiple warnings", "info- does your friend have special needs? She didn't respond when directly addressed multiple times", "NTA. Your friend needs to be more self aware, or stop ignoring the boundaries you try to put in place", "No not as far as we know now.", "NTA. \n\nI respect you for setting those boundaries. It's not that she asked to stay and then you kicked her out when she needed a place. She wasn't supposed to be there, it wasn't a crisis or emergency, and you were polite in how you asked her to leave, after dropping a multitude of hints.", "Info: How old are the both of you? \n\nI\u2019m gonna lean to NTA because it\u2019s not like you didn\u2019t warn her plenty of times. Not your fault if she ignored that. Even when you confronted her, you weren\u2019t that mean. She\u2019d already been there a week, so it\u2019s understandable you need time to yourself.", "NTA. You've been generous with your space but it sounds like she's starting to take it for granted. With some people, if you're too nice, they start feeling entitled to your time/money/resources, even invisible things like emotional labor. There's a saying that you don't know if someone is really your friend until you tell them no. \n\nI would actually not have her over for two weeks. Time for a little reset.", "ESH. Your friend needs to sort out her life so that she\u2019s not just escaping to your place all the time. It clearly doesn\u2019t seem to be about spending time with you, just using your place. \n\nBut you need to be direct and not assume your friend will pick up clues. Why on Earth didn\u2019t you just say \u201chi, you can be here for a couple of hours tonight but that\u2019s all. I really need an early night\u201d etc and then there\u2019s no need to make a performance out of it?\n\nYour friend needs to be more respectful of your place but you need to clearly communicate the rules exactly and not rely on dropping hints.", "NTA. Her behaviour would have been too much even without the ADHD.", "Doormat. That is what she sees you as. Boundaries? Fuck your boundaries apparently. This is her house now. Unless you put your damn foot down and assert yourself IN YOUR OWN HOME. NTA.", "NTA. This was not a shock. You told her at least three different times, in different ways, that you needed to be by yourself with some quiet. If she had maybe gone out into another room with her phone and left you alone, that might have been tolerable, but what did she do? She sat on your bed, one of the most private places a person can have, and actually physically touched you to get your attention back on her. As an introvert, this is my idea of hell. I'm really glad you asserted yourself and made your case very clear to her. She must have some other place to go to escape her parents, beside your home. If she decides to stop flouncing and feeling sorry for herself, and comes back to speak with you, you need to hash this out with her. That meanwhile, good for you being assertive.", "Reading it the first time was obvious  N T A. But re-reading it, I'm actually leaning towards NAH, possibly even YTA (more towards it the more I look at consequences). Although feel free to correct me if I'm wrong:\n\n\u201cWell I actually needed to have the apartment to myself tonight.\u201d\n\nThis is literally all you said to her in regards to you not wanting her to stay for the night.\n\nIf it is word-to-word this, imo it doesn't really... relay what you want to say?\n\nYou speak of it in past-tense, and you don't put any emphasis on you actually wanting her to be ready to leave by the night later. She can definitely chalk it up to you being bummed over it, but still allowing it nonetheless.\n\nAnd later telling her that you're going to bed isn't a memo, either. Instead of just asking her if she's going to be leaving or not.\n\nIt feels like you were being kind of vague and indirect with her, and then just kicked her out at midnight randomly. Being forced to walk home all alone in the middle of the night can be stressful, specially when you're a girl. Definitely not cool thing to happen.", "No you're not the gd mf AH.\n\nTapped you on the leg? GTFO.\n\nShe's trying to use you as a free hotel. And mad when you enforce your clear boundaries? You updated her like a storm warning. And she tries to make you feel bad about it grrrrrr", "I can not believe anyone here is saying anything other than NTA, the friend has no claim to the apartment.  As soon as it was said she needed the apartment to herself that night, there\u2019s no argument whatsoever for anything other than NTA and you can fuck right off if you disagree.", "NTA\n\nNext time start with \u201clisten I love you and I know your parents are annoying you right now but I need sleep.\u201d \n\nSkip the annoying part of it all.", ">you were polite in how you asked her to leave, after dropping a multitude of hints.\n\nThat's kind of the issue, though.\n\nThey dropped, like, one hint (\"I'm going to bed\" isn't a hint). A hint that put emphasis on how they'd rather have the night to themselves. And they never once directly told or put emphasis on the fact that the friend needs to leave.\n\nAnd instead of making it clear, or at least getting an affirmation, they just dropped a hint and went about their business.\n\nAnd then, the first time they decided to be direct about it, they randomly kicked the friend out at midnight.\n\nBeing given vague hints instead of direct confrontation/statement/request/etc only to be kicked out at midnight, specially as a girl who has to get home alone, kind of sucks. The more I think about it, the more I lean towards YTA.", "Gtfoh she was more direct as any normal person would need her to be", "OP has stated that the friend respects the boundaries as evident in past behaviour.\n\nHere, no clear boundaries were set and no requests were made, nor was there any direct communication attempt. OP dropped a relatively vague hint and then kicked her to go home alone in the middle of the night.", "Don't even go there. That sounds too much like the common excuse of, yes, I assaulted you and made your life hell, but I'm autistic, so I get a pass. Nobody considers that an excuse, especially here on Reddit!", "Totally, this is a prime case of someone thinking that their words are interpreted in exactly the same way that they intended them, even if the words are very ambiguous. If OP needs space they need to start voicing this clearly. I am sure the friend would have understood if they had said \"it was a challenging week for me, I'd really like us to have a short evening together today to go to bed early.\"", "Personally I feel like she knew about OP needing her space, OP said, \u201cI\u2019m going to bed\u201d twice, and then even got ready and physically went to bed, covered her face with her pillow.\n\nIf I was at someone\u2019s house and ignored all of those signs, I hope someone would be as patient and polite while telling me directly the way OP did.\n\nHowever, I can\u2019t even begin to understand getting myself home that late as a woman. That\u2019s a perspective I\u2019ve never experienced, and I won\u2019t presume to tell anyone how to navigate that.", "They weren't direct at all lol.\n\nThey literally made one statement towards it, and it wasn't even a direct one. It can easily be interpreted as being bummed over the friend staying, but otherwise allowing it. Specially as the OP chose to use past tense instead of present.\n\nIf I get someone food and they say \"Oh well, I didn't feel like eating...\", I get the impression that they might/will just eat anyway now that I've gotten them some instead of \"I don't feel like eating.\", which is a clear-cut response.", ">Here, no boundaries were set and no requests were made,\n\nAnd what exactly do you think this is?\n\n> I said \u201cWell I actually needed to have the apartment to myself tonight.\u201d", "So why didn't she ask if she could spend the night again? \n\nHonestly, the vibe I'm getting from the post is that both of you don't like confrontation and you were in a situation that required a confrontation, so ESH.", "The OP literally was dropping vague hints about how they'd rather be alone for the night instead of just making a clear-cut request lol.\n\nAny normal person would possibly misunderstand those, much less someone who might have some issues. The \"I needed the night for myself tonight\" can definitely be interpreted as someone saying they'd prefer if they had it for themselves, without actually requesting the other person to leave.\n\nOP literally refused to do any direct communication until midnight where they randomly kicked the friend out after their \"hints\" went without getting grasped.", "That exclamation point has me on the fence on whether or not you're being sarcastic", "Yeah. Specially as OP said that they've always respected the boundaries before.\n\nThis definitely sounds like a communication issue in this particular instance.", "A vague statement that can easily be interpreted as being bummed over her staying but complying anyway. Specifically with the usage of past tense, implying that it might be w/e now.\n\nSome people might take it as it's meant to be, some might just leave out of politeness, but it definitely isn't setting any boundary or making a proper request. It's dropping a hint \n\nAnd then later instead of asking when or if she's leaving, OP tries to drop even more hints by saying they're going to bed soon.", "It honestly seems like OP was being vague and indirect with her the entire time until the end. Literally the ONLY thing they said regarding wanting her to leave for the night was:\n\n\"I needed the home for myself tonight.\"\n\nLike, it gives the hint that if you want to be polite, you should go, but it doesn't really draw the line or actively puts emphasis on them having to leave.", "Perhaps. Many of us are raised to be kind, and nice, and never mean, etc. We are also raised to believe that when we do these nice, tactful things, the other person will respond in kind and understand everything that we mean, and never do anything to ever, ever hurt our feelings. I was raised that way. Tell your friend you're expecting company. Tell your friend you're going out for the day. What would have been so wrong with saying, hey, I'm an introvert, and I can only put up with so much conversation? So I give OP a pass and hope that in the future, she will feel more free to use real words and spend less time hoping that the other person will read her mind. I still say she is NTA. \nI also meant to ask OP if she had ever seen the skit on Saturday Night Live called \"The Thing That Wouldn't Leave.\"", "People use autism as a very poor excuse for very poor behavior. The exclamation point was perhaps a bit of irony about how we all behave on Reddit. Not exactly sarcasm. Bottom line. OP is NTA and the friend completely crossed the line.", "\n\nIf you think that statement was vague any discussion with you will be pointless. Good day.", "Assuming people will interpret ambiguity in the way one wans them to interpret is bad imo as it can lead to many misunderstandings.There are many ways to directly get one's point across in a very nice and civil manner.\n\nBut still, usually, I'd say NAH to stuff like this.\n\nHowever being ambiguous and only dropping a single hint before kicking out their best friend- who also happens to be a girl, to get back to her home all alone in the middle of the night?\n\nThe consequence of the ambiguity followed by harsh actions on very first attempt at being direct garners YTA from me.\n\nHoping that the other person will read kind is usually harmless. Here it wasn't, and put the friend in kind of a stressful situation. Possibly very stressful depending on where and how far away she lives.", "Put yourself in the situation:\n\n* Leave with nowhere to go late at night (apparently she's that scared of her parents)\n\nor\n\n* Be rude and tell OP she's staying no matter what\n\nShe isn't a rude or confrontational person so she kind of pretends what OP is *implying* isn't happening + apparently they'd been having a good time up until then.\n\nI'll even take the hit and say that OP didn't do his best to resolve the situation as he never directly told her to leave.", "If I bring someone food and they go **\"Oh well, I didn't feel hungry...\"** it really gives off a vibe that they might still eat, or will still eat. Just that they're bummed because they didn't feel hungry.\n\nNow replace that with **\"I don't feel hungry.\"**\n\nNow, imagine it being games night and you boot up an FPS. Friend goes, **\"I didn't want to play an FPS.\"**, it gives an impression that they didn't feel like playing it, but might as well now that you've opened it.\n\nNow change that with **\"I don't want to play an FPS.\"**\n\nYou can disagree, but it definitely is vague imo.", "I say she is extremely rude. She followed OP into their own bedroom, climbed on their bed, and poked them to make them listen to her. This is not a timid person. This is an abuser. This is a monster. I hope OP never has to deal with her again. I don't give the tiniest little bit of shit what happened to her after she left OP's apartment, either. In 20 years, she will have a son whose wife is about to give birth, and she will be the mother-in-law who invades the delivery room when the daughter-in-law has made it perfectly clear that she doesn't want any family members besides her husband in her room. And yes she is non-confrontational. Which in her little world translates to extreme passive aggression.", "> any discussion with you will be pointless.

Or is this some massive projecting issue?\n\nThem being on same bed or her poking OP is nothing OP is against in general. Nothing implies that. They hang out very often and have sleepovers all the time and OP never had any issues with how she behaves. They're definitely close enough for this sort of behavior.\n\n**Yet you're saying that she's an abuser and monster over this and you don't give two shits what happens to her (for instance, rape or worse) just because she poked her best friend in the leg?**\n\nGood lord, this ***is*** a certified Reddit moment. That's some incredibly twisted and absurd mindset.", "Just wanted to hear the PoV of why you'd think otherwise, but alrighto.", "Girl flat out become a monster and an abuser who deserves to have stuff happen to her in the middle of night because she laid on the same bed as her best friend and poked her in the leg, something that's probably common practice on literally every sleepover they have...\n\nReddit folks really gonna be condemning people to death over shoulder taps at this rate.", "So be it.", "I sure hope that was the last sleepover that OP ever has to endure."]}
