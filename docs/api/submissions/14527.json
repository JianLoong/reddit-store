We were divorced for three years prior to that after he cheated on me for about six years with the woman he married after our divorce. Ex and I share three children together. A 17 year old son, 16 year old daughter and 15 year old daughter. Ex got his second wife pregnant while we were married which is how the affair got revealed in the first place. I kicked him out and cut ties except for semi-civil co-parenting. I have never had anything to do with his daughter who is now 3.\n\nAfter my ex died my former MIL took her in temporarily. She's in poor health and my ex was her only child. The mother of the child had no family who was willing to take her. So she wanted to try and keep her out of foster care. My former MIL asked me about two months ago to consider raising her granddaughter seeing as she is the half sibling of my children. I told her I did not want to do that. She spoke to my children and they refused to ask me on her behalf. She suggested that my children might want to keep her in their family and how could I deny them that chance. So I asked my children if they had any thoughts or plans to take her on once any of them were 18. They all said no. My son said his grandma had mentioned that to him but he didn't care. My girls share a similar sentiment (though she did not ask them directly). Former MIL reached out again and I told her my answer was still no.\n\nShe suggested that her granddaughter is my family and I cut her off and said that is not true. I told her I am not the child's mother, stepmother, aunt or anything that would imply family.\n\nShe told me she will need to let the case worker know in the coming weeks that she needs a foster home if I can't take her. She told me to do it for her granddaughter, that she's innocent, how can I not love her (and rambled on a lot about that). I lost my cool, snapped at her and told her I don't want to help her granddaughter and foster care is the best place for her if she can't raise her. Former MIL told me I was a horrible evil woman and that it was no wonder my children didn't care about their sister when I had that attitude about her and she hoped one day it wouldn't come back to bite me in the ass.\n\nAITA for the way I spoke to her and for what I said about her granddaughter?\n\nETA: Ex and his wife/aka the mother of the child died.

Yes, the child is a half sibling to your children, but that does not create an obligation on your part.

This was her choice, now she can deal with it.", "NTA.  It is INSANE for the ex-MIL to try to rope you into this.  You went above and beyond even talking to your kids about this.  The child has been dealt a shitty hand, and I hope she isn\u2019t failed by the foster system.", "NTA. She\u2019s not your family and you have no obligations to her or your ex-MIL. \n\nYou sound like a good parent with solid boundaries.", "NTA. Say you did raise this child. How could this be the best option for them if every time you looked at them you\u2019d be reminded of the past events that happened? Say you did form some type of bond, would it ever be genuine other than for feeling guilt? That\u2019s not best case for the child and that\u2019s a fair assessment I think. There are people out there who can\u2019t have children who\u2019d probably love the option to adopt a small child and have the means to care for them. They would be there in the best interest of the child. Is foster care ideal? Maybe not, but that\u2019s not your responsibility as you did not conceive the child so you shouldn\u2019t feel guilty for voicing your opinion to your Ex MIL.", "NTA\n\nIf she wants to take her granddaughter in, she may do so. She doesn't have the right to bully you into doing so or try and go through your children to persuade you.", "NTA. So your ex-MIL wants you to raise the ultimate result of your late ex husband's affair just out of the goodness of your heart? Hell, Jesus himself didn't have a heart that big.\n\nNot to mention the time, effort and expense of raising another whole human being. She's desperate, understandably, but that's not a reason to disrespect your VERY reasonable boundaries.", "NTA, \n\nThe kid is innocent, but you do not know her and I think her presence will remind you of what happened. It will not be good for either of you.", "NTA but where's the mom in this?", "NTA - I can maybe see her asking you but you were CLEAR that you answer was unequivocally no.", "Sad for the child- she will pay the price for the poor decisions of her parents, but you are under no obligation to take responsibility for the child.

The fact that your ex MIL is trying to guilt you into caring for her is disgusting. If the child\u2019s own mother and her, who is literally related to the child, cannot care for that little girl, why are you who has no blood with her be expected to care for her? Some people are seriously twisted in the head.", "NTA. Your MIL is trying to guilt you into raising a child that you do not have a connection to and that's not fair. It is sad for the child that she lost both of her parents. But she needs a family that will love and appreciate her for the little joy she is. Understandably, you are not that person for several reasons. \n\nOne is, your kids are teenagers and you're close to being an empty-nester. Starting over at this point would be a huge life change for you, one that you are clearly not willing to make. Secondly, her existence was a catalyst for the end of your marriage. She doesn't need to grow up with that hanging over her head.", "NTA. This is a horrible situation but she's not your responsability.

Granny is overstepping here and she needs to back off fast.", "NAH\n\nI don't blame you for not taking her in. She is not your responsibility.\n\nI don't blame your ex-MIL for being desperate to protect her grandchild.

You are completely within your rights to say no, and I don\u2019t blame you.  At the same time, I cannot fault a grieving mother for fighting tooth and nail to try to protect her grandchild from being abused in the foster care system.

I don't know if it was mentioned, but why can't the mother take care of her?", "NTA. People need to remember that an affair is a very painful thing for the person being cheated on. The child is the evidence of the years long affair. I only speak for myself by saying that I don't want to be reminded of betrayal. I am not going to pick up the pieces of the betrayal either. Sounds horrible but I wouldn't even want to be in the same room as the child for a long time.", "Instead of haranging you, your ex-MIL should contact the second wife's family to see what options are available for this child's care.

NTA.", "You have 0 responsibility towards that child so your NTA.  However, I hope your kids have some type of sentiment towards that child. Its not her fault their dad cheated.", "NAH. You're not obligated to take her, but I understand the grandmother trying to make sure the child is taken care of, even if she is crossing boundaries by going to your kids after you put up boundaries", "NTA - It's your life and you're under no obligation, but you can't really blame the MIL for trying.  She obviously cares for her 3 year old granddaughter but isn't capable of taking care of herself.\n\nFoster care vs an actual stable family.  It's a no brainer since foster care is typically consigning the kid for a brutal life, the innocent 3 year old is literally living worst case scenario: Father and Mother pass away, no family can take them, so they're thrown into the annals of a horrific system.\n\nThere's also the idea that \"blood is thicker than water\".  Your kids right now don't care about her, but later on in life, knowing they had a half sister disappear on them into a system they could have saved her from could lead to regrets (could have been Hero's).\n\nIt's a horrible situation, I'm so sad for the little girl.", "NAH (apart from your cheating ex). His daughter is not your family. It's doesn't sounds like your kids are that close to her either.\n\nWhile I do feel sorry for the poor girl there are many kids who have lost their parents and you are no more responsible for her that you are for any of them. Foster care isn't good I know, but is it any better to be taken in by your fathers ex who is going to resent you?\n\nI'm saying NAH rather than N-T-A because I can't really fault her grandmother for being desperate to keep her grandchild out of the system, particularly after she's lost her son.", "NAH.

It\u2019s your life and your choice 100%, though.", "Why would the caveat for taking in the child be that your kids would have to raise her when they turn 18? Of course they will say \u201cno\u201d to that. If you really don\u2019t want her permanently, why not foster her?

Foster kids can and do thrive, and being a foster kid does not mean you\u2019ll be a traumatized individual incapable of leading a healthy life.

The parents do have some say in that though (for example, my father refused to allow for adoption because his intent was always to fight to get us back, which he did thank god, though it took almost a decade). The bouncing around occurs either way though. Usually it starts with short term homes while the system looks around for a long term placement, and then even those placements often collapse, either due to personality conflicts or simply that well intentioned people were just not prepared to nagivate the challenges of raising a traumatised child or how it changes the existing family dynamic. Those ones hurt the most, they make you feel like you are totally unwanted and unloveable, and that shit stays with you for a loooooong time. So if you're looking to foster and eventually adopt, I would suggest really doing your research and taking some classes (especially if you are fostering/adopting kids from different cultural backgrounds), make sure you have the tools for both the child and your family to help navigate the unfortunately too common mental health challenges, and maybe try short term placements to see if you can manage it at first.

I'm not an overly kind person myself but I still have 4 people off hand that would easily take in my kids if my husband and I died- we have talked them about it. I am also the first in line to take 2 of theirs. People who don't have anyone are a red flag (unless sthey recently moved or something circumstantial)", "NTA, I can't believe she asked you. That would be a horrible, awkward situation to put you and the poor child in. Children deserve love! That would be hard for you to provide with this history.

Look, it\u2019s a horrible situation, and the child is an innocent, but with the anger that you still feel about your ex and his affair with the child\u2019s mother, it would likely not be a good placement for either you or the little girl. In spite of yourself, there could be times when you have less patience and you might slip into the beginning of an unhealthy dynamic.  I also expect that this may be a time when, as your kids are growing up and moving on, that you will be thinking of your own plans for the next chapter of your life, and taking on a small child takes you back to square one.  \n\nI think that your ExMIL is delusional, thinking that any of this is your responsibility to take on.  Your ex and his partner made this mess (the situation, I would never blame the little girl), but you are not obliged to do clean up duty for at least the next 16 years.  Is there any reason why your ExMIL can\u2019t look after this child that she feels so strongly about?  There may be a valid reason, but she doesn\u2019t seem to realise that you have reasons too.  She has done with the manipulation stage, and is now in the angry judgmental stage.  It just beggars belief that she is doing this to you over a child that she also won\u2019t be keeping.  If there is judgment to be spread around then she should look at herself in the mirror.

Yes, he screwed up big time, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that there was a time where you two loved each other, had a family together, and had some good times. It\u2019s got to be such a confusing time right now, emotionally and mentally. My heart breaks for all of you! No one deserves all of that!\n\nYou\u2019re NTA for feeling as you do. Your ex left quite a mess behind for everyone to have to pick up and it sure as heck isn\u2019t fair. \n\nIf I were in your place, I would have such a difficult time figuring out what to do. The sympathetic person I am would want to help the child, knowing that grandma isn\u2019t able to care for her like the child needs, that the child is the innocent victim in all of this and certainly would not have chosen to be the product of an affair if given the choice, this is the half sibling to my children, and knowing how flawed and messed up our foster care system is and the lasting impacts it could have on the child if we didn\u2019t take her in.\n\nOn the other hand I would also have to question whether or not I could be a fair parent to the child - would I be able to do right by her or would looking at her face be too much of a daily reminder to the awful and painful choices the stupid ex made and destroyed our family? Would that impact how I would interact with this child? \n\nI probably would also think about things like\u2026 \n\n1) Am I  in a position to make rational choices in the moment with emotions being so understandably high? \n\n2) Would my kids have any later regrets that we let the child go to foster care when their hurts have settled? \n\n3) Would I later feel guilty if the child ended up in foster care? Or if she was mistreated while in foster care?\n\n4) How would we answer the tough questions if she later tries to reach out to us? \n\n5) Am I making my decisions based off of hurt or for what\u2019s really best for my family? \n\nThis is only from my perspective if I was in your situation and in no way meant to sway you one way or another, OP. It\u2019s really awful what your ex decided to do and what he left for all of you to deal with and I sympathize for you. \n\nAt the end of the day, you know you and your family\u2019s needs best.

You'd become sainted if you were strong enough to take in that child, who is alone through no fault of her own.

I can understand OP\u2019s pain filled reason for rejecting this child. I can also understand how devastated and afraid the ex MIL must be that she is forced to press this issue. I don\u2019t know what I would do but I feel like if it was at all possible, I would take this child into my home and raise her with her siblings. This innocent child has no clue of the circumstances of her birth. I fear that, one day, when the half siblings are adults and parents themselves, they will wonder what became of the child they rejected. I feel like this could create a lot of grief and pain and guilt for everyone.", "NTA\n\nDo I wish that you were willing to take this kid in? Sure I do. But you deserve happiness, and it seems like you cannot be happy with this kid. To say nothing on the impact on your life, if you are unhappy it will negatively affect the kid anyway. Her father's family and her mothers family are responsible for her - why isn't exMIL fighting those family members to take the kid in. You are the easiest person to dump on, but you have no relation to this child. Taking her in would be the same as if you were to go to an adoption agency and adopt another child - no one has asked you to do that, and you have exactly as much obligation. \n\nYes, if your children really wanted to keep her in their life then maybe the decision would be tougher, but they don't consider her their sister, so you don't need to either. \n\nI wish there was a scenario in which this child could live a happy life with you, but that isn't realy possible and it's not your fault.

My friends do the b3st they can but sometimes you can Def see the struggle at home.", "NTA but damn! Poor kid. Is there any estate that might come with the kid that could make it worth your while? It just sucks to hear this is happening to a baby.", "NTA, but\u2026 honestly I might do it. The child is 3. Her parents both just died. How does a 3 year old even process that? And her sick grandmother cannot take care of her. Your kids are her siblings\n\nAs much as I would hate my ex (and omg would I hate them) my heart would break for that toddler. I\u2019m not sure I could send her into the system after that trauma", "She would get a stipend, free medical, and daycare costs from the state. There\u2019s a few paths you can take. You can do fictive kin, child specific foster care, or normal foster care license. Each one comes with a different amount of pay. It\u2019s still not enough to cover expenses but it\u2019s at least something.", "My friend is an affair child and he is pretty fucked up. He doesn\u2019t feel like he belongs anywhere and his siblings barely acknowledge his existence. Why do people bring children into the world under such circumstances?? (That\u2019s rhetorical.) I like to think that I would be able to see the child as someone who really needs love and not as a bad decision that two people made. Bring her here, I\u2019ll be her mom. Oh geeze now my eyes are leaking.", "Nahhh mom shares responsibility too. They had an affair for six years there\u2019s no way she didn\u2019t know she was fucking a married man. That\u2019s a poor decision.", "Not to mention how she tried to get OP's children to speak on her behalf. NTA.", "> It's already a red flag that no one in the maternal family wants her\n\nI don't see why its a red flag, the child is only 3 - sure she might be a handful or a bit ruly for a 3 year old but hardly a red flag\n\nThe only red flag is the maternal family taking no responsibility for their own relation - not that they should have to of course"]}
