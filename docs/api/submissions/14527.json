We were divorced for three years prior to that after he cheated on me for about six years with the woman he married after our divorce. Ex and I share three children together. A 17 year old son, 16 year old daughter and 15 year old daughter. Ex got his second wife pregnant while we were married which is how the affair got revealed in the first place. I kicked him out and cut ties except for semi-civil co-parenting. I have never had anything to do with his daughter who is now 3.\n\nAfter my ex died my former MIL took her in temporarily. She's in poor health and my ex was her only child. The mother of the child had no family who was willing to take her. So she wanted to try and keep her out of foster care. My former MIL asked me about two months ago to consider raising her granddaughter seeing as she is the half sibling of my children. I told her I did not want to do that. She spoke to my children and they refused to ask me on her behalf. She suggested that my children might want to keep her in their family and how could I deny them that chance. So I asked my children if they had any thoughts or plans to take her on once any of them were 18. They all said no. My son said his grandma had mentioned that to him but he didn't care. My girls share a similar sentiment (though she did not ask them directly). Former MIL reached out again and I told her my answer was still no.\n\nShe suggested that her granddaughter is my family and I cut her off and said that is not true. I told her I am not the child's mother, stepmother, aunt or anything that would imply family.\n\nShe told me she will need to let the case worker know in the coming weeks that she needs a foster home if I can't take her. She told me to do it for her granddaughter, that she's innocent, how can I not love her (and rambled on a lot about that). I lost my cool, snapped at her and told her I don't want to help her granddaughter and foster care is the best place for her if she can't raise her. Former MIL told me I was a horrible evil woman and that it was no wonder my children didn't care about their sister when I had that attitude about her and she hoped one day it wouldn't come back to bite me in the ass.\n\nAITA for the way I spoke to her and for what I said about her granddaughter?\n\nETA: Ex and his wife/aka the mother of the child died.

This was her choice, now she can deal with it.", "NTA.  It is INSANE for the ex-MIL to try to rope you into this.  You went above and beyond even talking to your kids about this.  The child has been dealt a shitty hand, and I hope she isn\u2019t failed by the foster system.", "NTA. She\u2019s not your family and you have no obligations to her or your ex-MIL. \n\nYou sound like a good parent with solid boundaries.", "NTA. Say you did raise this child. How could this be the best option for them if every time you looked at them you\u2019d be reminded of the past events that happened? Say you did form some type of bond, would it ever be genuine other than for feeling guilt? That\u2019s not best case for the child and that\u2019s a fair assessment I think. There are people out there who can\u2019t have children who\u2019d probably love the option to adopt a small child and have the means to care for them. They would be there in the best interest of the child. Is foster care ideal? Maybe not, but that\u2019s not your responsibility as you did not conceive the child so you shouldn\u2019t feel guilty for voicing your opinion to your Ex MIL.", "NTA\n\nIf she wants to take her granddaughter in, she may do so. She doesn't have the right to bully you into doing so or try and go through your children to persuade you.", "NTA. So your ex-MIL wants you to raise the ultimate result of your late ex husband's affair just out of the goodness of your heart? Hell, Jesus himself didn't have a heart that big.\n\nNot to mention the time, effort and expense of raising another whole human being. She's desperate, understandably, but that's not a reason to disrespect your VERY reasonable boundaries.", "NTA, \n\nThe kid is innocent, but you do not know her and I think her presence will remind you of what happened. It will not be good for either of you.", "NTA but where's the mom in this?", "NTA - I can maybe see her asking you but you were CLEAR that you answer was unequivocally no.", "Sad for the child- she will pay the price for the poor decisions of her parents, but you are under no obligation to take responsibility for the child.

The fact that your ex MIL is trying to guilt you into caring for her is disgusting. If the child\u2019s own mother and her, who is literally related to the child, cannot care for that little girl, why are you who has no blood with her be expected to care for her? Some people are seriously twisted in the head.", "NTA. Your MIL is trying to guilt you into raising a child that you do not have a connection to and that's not fair. It is sad for the child that she lost both of her parents. But she needs a family that will love and appreciate her for the little joy she is. Understandably, you are not that person for several reasons. \n\nOne is, your kids are teenagers and you're close to being an empty-nester. Starting over at this point would be a huge life change for you, one that you are clearly not willing to make. Secondly, her existence was a catalyst for the end of your marriage. She doesn't need to grow up with that hanging over her head.", "NTA. This is a horrible situation but she's not your responsability.

Granny is overstepping here and she needs to back off fast.", "NAH\n\nI don't blame you for not taking her in. She is not your responsibility.\n\nI don't blame your ex-MIL for being desperate to protect her grandchild.

You are completely within your rights to say no, and I don\u2019t blame you.  At the same time, I cannot fault a grieving mother for fighting tooth and nail to try to protect her grandchild from being abused in the foster care system.

I don't know if it was mentioned, but why can't the mother take care of her?", "NTA. People need to remember that an affair is a very painful thing for the person being cheated on. The child is the evidence of the years long affair. I only speak for myself by saying that I don't want to be reminded of betrayal. I am not going to pick up the pieces of the betrayal either. Sounds horrible but I wouldn't even want to be in the same room as the child for a long time.", "Instead of haranging you, your ex-MIL should contact the second wife's family to see what options are available for this child's care.

NTA.", "You have 0 responsibility towards that child so your NTA.  However, I hope your kids have some type of sentiment towards that child. Its not her fault their dad cheated.", "NAH. You're not obligated to take her, but I understand the grandmother trying to make sure the child is taken care of, even if she is crossing boundaries by going to your kids after you put up boundaries", "NTA - It's your life and you're under no obligation, but you can't really blame the MIL for trying.  She obviously cares for her 3 year old granddaughter but isn't capable of taking care of herself.\n\nFoster care vs an actual stable family.  It's a no brainer since foster care is typically consigning the kid for a brutal life, the innocent 3 year old is literally living worst case scenario: Father and Mother pass away, no family can take them, so they're thrown into the annals of a horrific system.\n\nThere's also the idea that \"blood is thicker than water\".  Your kids right now don't care about her, but later on in life, knowing they had a half sister disappear on them into a system they could have saved her from could lead to regrets (could have been Hero's).\n\nIt's a horrible situation, I'm so sad for the little girl.", "NAH (apart from your cheating ex). His daughter is not your family. It's doesn't sounds like your kids are that close to her either.\n\nWhile I do feel sorry for the poor girl there are many kids who have lost their parents and you are no more responsible for her that you are for any of them. Foster care isn't good I know, but is it any better to be taken in by your fathers ex who is going to resent you?\n\nI'm saying NAH rather than N-T-A because I can't really fault her grandmother for being desperate to keep her grandchild out of the system, particularly after she's lost her son.", "NAH.

It\u2019s your life and your choice 100%, though.", "Why would the caveat for taking in the child be that your kids would have to raise her when they turn 18? Of course they will say \u201cno\u201d to that. If you really don\u2019t want her permanently, why not foster her?

Otherwise your desperate ailing mother will try guilt tripping your ex wife you cheated on.", ">The mother of the child had no family who was willing to take her.\n\n\n>She told me she will need to let the case worker know in the coming weeks that she needs a foster home if I can't take her.\n\n\nIt's in the post", "Op said that no one is willing to take the child on the mothers side", "oh yeah, that's true!!", "Even more than she\u2019ll already have with losing both of her parents. Poor kid.", " The kid didn't asked to be born. MIL is right, the half-siblings are assholes or influenced by OP. That they don't take her in is understandable, but the three could have shown some interest in the kid.\n\nThe true homewreckers are dead, the child is innocent.", "THIS. \n\nAlso, even with all the flaws of the foster care system (which are absolutely *legion*, holy crap. I was a bio-kid of foster parents who shouldn't have been foster parents and the stuff I saw gave me PTSD. I mean that literally, as in I'm paying several hundred dollars a month on EMDR to treat the trauma I went through back then. I will leave it there because I don't feel like triggering a day of flashbacks), OP is *still* in a NAH situation in my book.\n\nMy reasoning: At least in the system the kid has a *chance* to live with someone who loves her and doesn't resent her for existing.  It might be small, but small is better than 0. As someone whose mother resents them for existing, I know first hand how traumatizing that is.\n\nEdit: Also - again can't get into details because I like being functional on a Tuesday but there's been studies done to show that unwanted children are at much higher risks of neglect and abuse than wanted kids. So if someone in a parental role resents you for existing, not only do you have the trauma of that rejection, but also likely other forms of trauma as well.", "Agreed. OP is NTA but it took 1.5yrs for my nephew to have his case even changed from placement to adoption. Once that happened and we were able to bring him home it took another 1.5yrs for our adoption case to be seen. That\u2019s 3 years of his life. This little girl will get placed for adoption with no family claiming her, hopefully she\u2019ll be able to stay with grandma until an adoption placement is found, but it could take years.", "^well said. Thank you for saying that", "It is beneficial though, for how it's beneficial avoiding growing up with a person that is rightfully indifferent (borderline hate - as a symbol, not personally) to you. Foster care is better than OP taking the kid, because it would automatically create an insane environment. Foster care is far from perfect but there is a chance it will go well. If OP takes the child, there is no chance it will go well. \n\nThen yes, there could be physical abuse in fc, and in that case we could ask \"it is better a person (probably would never be mother) who doesn't love you and is indifferent to you, but at least you are in her house and you only suffer psychological damage\"? But we are going into hypothesis here. Fc could also lead to a decent accommodation that could offer the same \"roof on your head and food\" accomodations that, realistically, would be the only things OP would guarantee; plus maybe the possibility of not being despised by who is raising you.", "So why isn't MIL berating them to take her.  It is not on OP to take her.  There are other people that MIL can harass to take this child.", "That's the mother side of the family. What about the father's side of the family? Wonder if she's guilt tripping them like she's trying to do to OP, who's is of no relation. The caseworker will try to place a child with family. I don't see why the caseworker would even ask OP unless she was volunteered by somebody.", "How is it irresponsible not to take in the child of the people who ruined your mother's life, whom you have no relationship with, for a job that they are unequipped to deal with? These kids are teenagers who should be free to live the life they want without having to deal with the consequences of *actual* irresponsible behavior of awful people who hurt them.", "> half-siblings are assholes\n\nSo the half siblings who are not even legal age yet to take in the 3 year old are assholes for being minors?", "Why would teenagers and preteens be interested in a baby that there Dad had by cheating on mom? Kids that age know what\u2019s going on and have their own friends, after school activities etc. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s strange they\u2019re not interested at all given the circumstances and ages( considering dad was having an affair for 6 years(that takes a lot of time away from 3kids))", "I have 3 half siblings that I willingly let go into foster care. It doesn't mean that I hate them. I just don't know them. Nor do I have ability to care for them. Not everyone is cut out to be a parent. Hope and faith isn't enough to raise a child.", "No they are not asshole, their father cheating has broke the family they use to know, than he died and I think they didn\u2019t have a way to get over what happened. \n\nPlus they would have to take custody at 18 is a huge ask and means putting all their life on hold, they aren\u2019t asshole for wanting something more than be single parents at 18.", "[removed]", "There's definitely a chance it would go well, but it would require OP to sacrifice her time and money into raising the child.  OP has no reason to hate the child, and if she did that then she would be awful.\n\nFoster care puts you in a situation where you know you are unwanted, because if you were wanted then you wouldn't be in foster care.", "But she IS punishing the child for the sins of her father.  It's not the child's fault that her father created her in a manner that so hurt OP. I don't think the answer is so cut and dried. Does OP have any responsibility for the child? No. Is her ex MIL wrong for what she's doing to OP? Yes, although it probably shows desperation and fear. But, we also know how awful foster care can be, especially for little girls. Just because we don't have responsibility for something doesn't mean we always can or should walk away. And she is a half sibling to OPs kids. If OP can't find some compassion in her heart for this child, I can almost guarantee it will not end well for her. Adults (ie cheating spouse) suck sometimes - can we not try to make things better for the next generation?", "Wouldn't have been a her to leave if not for the affair.", "True, but as a parent I know who will take my kids in the event of both myself and my spouse dying and have since the first was born. When my friend was pregnant we had a long talk about whether I was the best guardian if something happened to her as her relatives were not able to step into that role.\n\nIf you have kids, then for the sake of everything you think holy, make a plan for what happens if they lose their immediate caregivers.", "Who knows. Maybe she doesn't really know them or know how to contact them. But she has known op for a long time as the mother of her other grandkids and might think she would be the best choice.", "I think you replied to me trying to reply to OP? I am not OP.", "Comment partly stolen from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ij028/-/jftn72u).", "It's a recipe for a disaster imho. Like, 95% of probability of ending bad, it doesn't even deserve a try.\n\nThis situation is a mix of \"asking a woman to randomly become a mother for someone\" and \"asking a woman to sacrifice an incredible amount of time, money and effort to repair to a man error\". It can't go well. Maybe there is a martyr out there who would be willing to do this, but not a person with a normal, healthy amount of self interest (which OP seems to be). Edit: in short, It's a sacrifice and a very big one, that isn't normal to even ask to someone imho", "> There's definitely a chance it would go well, but it would require OP to sacrifice her time and money into raising the child.  OP has no reason to hate the child, and if she did that then she would be awful.\n\nOP has no reason to hate the child, but it is certainly a significant likelihood that they would. Recognizing this real possibility is wise. Deciding not to make the life sacrifices needed in caring for a child is not wrong. \n\nIf this was the child of OP's best friend or close cousin I could maybe see that there could be some obligation, but if it was the child of a former best friend or estranged cousin after some horrific betrayal?\n\nThe child may be innocent, but so are many of the other orphans in the city, state, country, world. Deciding not to take care of them does not make OK any worse than it makes all of us.", "That\u2019s a whole lot of preaching from someone who\u2019s doing a whole lot of nothing for that child.", "Sounds like you should take the kid in then.", "she is NOT punishing the child. Your concept of punishing seems that just because OP knows the child, she has an obligation to take her. So everyone is punishing the child then? the neighbor, the ppl from Market, the nurse who made her birth. Everyone who knew her or saw her are punishing the kid for not taking her? no. punishing would be a mother deciding not taking her kid.\n\nOP has absolutely ZERO conection with that kid. OP taking her would be the same as someone random who saw her once on the street. Besides would really be better to live in a home where you are not loved or cared at all, even by your half siblings?", "It\u2019s not a punishment to not decide to adopt and raise someone for the next 15 years. There are plenty of kids in foster care, and I\u2019m not punishing them by not upending my life to take them in.", "Easy for you since all you have to do is say it from the comfort of your chair, but OP is the one who has to actually do it. Compassion has nothing to do with the reality of disrupting her family, which she has an actual duty towards. I respect her more for caring about her actual kids than someone else's mistake. That girl is not her direct family, it was the child's misfortune to be stuck in that situation. Sad, but not OPs obligation. If you feel so bad, then you adopt her.", "So what you\u2019re saying is that OP, who has already had her life destroyed by her ex\u2019s actions should start over with a three year old when her kids are approaching college age.  Raising kids when you love them and are fully committed to them is hard.  It\u2019s infinitely harder if you\u2019re forced to raise one you have no feelings for and  are not committed to.  Ex and the AP should have addressed this issue knowing they had limited options in case something happened.  Also MIL was so out of line trying to pressure her oldest grandchild to assume responsibility at 18 that it\u2019s laughable.", "You're forgetting one of the most important questions. Can OP afford it?", "So are you volunteering?", "She has no more obligation to take the child in than you or I do.", "That's a bot who stole someone else's comment, which is why it doesn't make sense as a reply to you."]}
