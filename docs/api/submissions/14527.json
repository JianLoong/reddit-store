We were divorced for three years prior to that after he cheated on me for about six years with the woman he married after our divorce. Ex and I share three children together. A 17 year old son, 16 year old daughter and 15 year old daughter. Ex got his second wife pregnant while we were married which is how the affair got revealed in the first place. I kicked him out and cut ties except for semi-civil co-parenting. I have never had anything to do with his daughter who is now 3.\n\nAfter my ex died my former MIL took her in temporarily. She's in poor health and my ex was her only child. The mother of the child had no family who was willing to take her. So she wanted to try and keep her out of foster care. My former MIL asked me about two months ago to consider raising her granddaughter seeing as she is the half sibling of my children. I told her I did not want to do that. She spoke to my children and they refused to ask me on her behalf. She suggested that my children might want to keep her in their family and how could I deny them that chance. So I asked my children if they had any thoughts or plans to take her on once any of them were 18. They all said no. My son said his grandma had mentioned that to him but he didn't care. My girls share a similar sentiment (though she did not ask them directly). Former MIL reached out again and I told her my answer was still no.\n\nShe suggested that her granddaughter is my family and I cut her off and said that is not true. I told her I am not the child's mother, stepmother, aunt or anything that would imply family.\n\nShe told me she will need to let the case worker know in the coming weeks that she needs a foster home if I can't take her. She told me to do it for her granddaughter, that she's innocent, how can I not love her (and rambled on a lot about that). I lost my cool, snapped at her and told her I don't want to help her granddaughter and foster care is the best place for her if she can't raise her. Former MIL told me I was a horrible evil woman and that it was no wonder my children didn't care about their sister when I had that attitude about her and she hoped one day it wouldn't come back to bite me in the ass.\n\nAITA for the way I spoke to her and for what I said about her granddaughter?\n\nETA: Ex and his wife/aka the mother of the child died.

Yes, the child is a half sibling to your children, but that does not create an obligation on your part.

This was her choice, now she can deal with it.", "NTA.  It is INSANE for the ex-MIL to try to rope you into this.  You went above and beyond even talking to your kids about this.  The child has been dealt a shitty hand, and I hope she isn\u2019t failed by the foster system.", "NTA. She\u2019s not your family and you have no obligations to her or your ex-MIL. \n\nYou sound like a good parent with solid boundaries.", "NTA. Say you did raise this child. How could this be the best option for them if every time you looked at them you\u2019d be reminded of the past events that happened? Say you did form some type of bond, would it ever be genuine other than for feeling guilt? That\u2019s not best case for the child and that\u2019s a fair assessment I think. There are people out there who can\u2019t have children who\u2019d probably love the option to adopt a small child and have the means to care for them. They would be there in the best interest of the child. Is foster care ideal? Maybe not, but that\u2019s not your responsibility as you did not conceive the child so you shouldn\u2019t feel guilty for voicing your opinion to your Ex MIL.", "NTA\n\nIf she wants to take her granddaughter in, she may do so. She doesn't have the right to bully you into doing so or try and go through your children to persuade you.", "NTA. So your ex-MIL wants you to raise the ultimate result of your late ex husband's affair just out of the goodness of your heart? Hell, Jesus himself didn't have a heart that big.\n\nNot to mention the time, effort and expense of raising another whole human being. She's desperate, understandably, but that's not a reason to disrespect your VERY reasonable boundaries.", "NTA, \n\nThe kid is innocent, but you do not know her and I think her presence will remind you of what happened. It will not be good for either of you.", "NTA but where's the mom in this?", "NTA - I can maybe see her asking you but you were CLEAR that you answer was unequivocally no.", "Sad for the child- she will pay the price for the poor decisions of her parents, but you are under no obligation to take responsibility for the child.

The fact that your ex MIL is trying to guilt you into caring for her is disgusting. If the child\u2019s own mother and her, who is literally related to the child, cannot care for that little girl, why are you who has no blood with her be expected to care for her? Some people are seriously twisted in the head.", "NTA. Your MIL is trying to guilt you into raising a child that you do not have a connection to and that's not fair. It is sad for the child that she lost both of her parents. But she needs a family that will love and appreciate her for the little joy she is. Understandably, you are not that person for several reasons. \n\nOne is, your kids are teenagers and you're close to being an empty-nester. Starting over at this point would be a huge life change for you, one that you are clearly not willing to make. Secondly, her existence was a catalyst for the end of your marriage. She doesn't need to grow up with that hanging over her head.", "NTA. This is a horrible situation but she's not your responsability.

Granny is overstepping here and she needs to back off fast.", "NAH\n\nI don't blame you for not taking her in. She is not your responsibility.\n\nI don't blame your ex-MIL for being desperate to protect her grandchild.

You are completely within your rights to say no, and I don\u2019t blame you.  At the same time, I cannot fault a grieving mother for fighting tooth and nail to try to protect her grandchild from being abused in the foster care system.

I don't know if it was mentioned, but why can't the mother take care of her?", "NTA. People need to remember that an affair is a very painful thing for the person being cheated on. The child is the evidence of the years long affair. I only speak for myself by saying that I don't want to be reminded of betrayal. I am not going to pick up the pieces of the betrayal either. Sounds horrible but I wouldn't even want to be in the same room as the child for a long time.", "Instead of haranging you, your ex-MIL should contact the second wife's family to see what options are available for this child's care.

NTA.", "You have 0 responsibility towards that child so your NTA.  However, I hope your kids have some type of sentiment towards that child. Its not her fault their dad cheated.", "NAH. You're not obligated to take her, but I understand the grandmother trying to make sure the child is taken care of, even if she is crossing boundaries by going to your kids after you put up boundaries", "NTA - It's your life and you're under no obligation, but you can't really blame the MIL for trying.  She obviously cares for her 3 year old granddaughter but isn't capable of taking care of herself.\n\nFoster care vs an actual stable family.  It's a no brainer since foster care is typically consigning the kid for a brutal life, the innocent 3 year old is literally living worst case scenario: Father and Mother pass away, no family can take them, so they're thrown into the annals of a horrific system.\n\nThere's also the idea that \"blood is thicker than water\".  Your kids right now don't care about her, but later on in life, knowing they had a half sister disappear on them into a system they could have saved her from could lead to regrets (could have been Hero's).\n\nIt's a horrible situation, I'm so sad for the little girl.", "NAH (apart from your cheating ex). His daughter is not your family. It's doesn't sounds like your kids are that close to her either.\n\nWhile I do feel sorry for the poor girl there are many kids who have lost their parents and you are no more responsible for her that you are for any of them. Foster care isn't good I know, but is it any better to be taken in by your fathers ex who is going to resent you?\n\nI'm saying NAH rather than N-T-A because I can't really fault her grandmother for being desperate to keep her grandchild out of the system, particularly after she's lost her son.", "NAH.

It\u2019s your life and your choice 100%, though.", "Why would the caveat for taking in the child be that your kids would have to raise her when they turn 18? Of course they will say \u201cno\u201d to that. If you really don\u2019t want her permanently, why not foster her?

The poor child would better served trying to find prospective foster &/or adoptive parents among her other family members & community (esp church, if she has one).  Desperation, understandable as it is, doesn\u2019t give her the right to harass and berate her former DIL or her *teenage grandchildren*.

Back off , EMIL!", "NTA\n\nIt would be an incredible ask for someone whose children are about to leave the nest to take on the care of a toddler - and one who no doubt is going to have some kind of trauma issues in terms of the loss of both parents. \n\nAnd of course there is no obligation - and quite audacity to be so dense as to expect OP to take on the care of the affair child which effectively ended the marriage and broke up the home. \n\nI realize that foster system isn't great. Perhaps I am naive but the child is still young enough to have a good chance of being adopted by a family. A lot of kids in the foster system don't have parents who are willing to give up parental rights and so they linger in the foster system essentially in limbo. Best thing for the child would be to have it adopted while she is still an age when there are more families who want a younger child.", "Former Foster kid reporting in. I aged out of the system. What I have to say about my experience, is that I wished the system took me in sooner. I endured years of abuse before I was removed from my Sperm/Egg doner. I was extremely great full when the abuse ended. Foster Care is by no means optimal, but it was the best place for me and my mental and physical well-being.

My mother is irreparably damaged due to being adopted by a family who didn't care about her. Her bio parents also didn't care. She struggles desperately for a sense of community and love. I was raised by these grandparents, personally my grandfather definitely felt love but the grandmother was a narcissist and the rest of the family loathed my existence. It caused the opposite type of damage to me, I shun community and am terrified of being loved to any extent. If you adopted her and couldn't find yourself (or her siblings couldn't) able to love her, that will absolutely damage that child even if you mask it.

The fact that your children are related to her, when you are not, gives you no more obligation to her than any other stranger on the street.

Kudos to your kids for not caving to that type of manipulation.\n\nIt's not worth the risk. IMO - Better for a child to enter the foster system, as flawed as it is, than to exist in a home where they are an outsider for their entire lives due to something that is no fault of their own.\n\nYour MIL has other resources available as well. She could seek government assistance to keep the child at home, seek out help from friends, or - If the child is young - Try to work to have them adopted so that they don't go into foster care. At three years old, she has better prospects now than she will at an older age. If she has assets, she can set up a trust and pursue some options in that direction to ensure the child has a college fund or something else so that she has a parachute to escape foster care once she is old enough.\n\nIn the end, it sucks.

And you?", "I'm sorry, to be clear, I don't doubt you love them. I just think you'e not making this decision based on your love fo them. As parents, we both know that children don't have the wisdom to know whether they'd regret that decision.", "No, she\u2019s not. I never said she was. I said she was an asshole for losing it on MIL who\u2019s trying to find home for child other than foster care. A firm but polite no is all that was necessary. \n\nIf I was in her position, I\u2019d strongly consider taking in the child. She however, has no obligation. However, taking in and loving and needful child isn\u2019t about obligation.", "I think Bob Geldof adopted Paula Yates' youngest after she died (half sister to the three girls he had with her)", "Given that you already talked with your children, then that's nothing more you can do.", "As a woman who struggled with infertility, thank you so much for saying this. While I would like to adopt someday, after researching what goes into becoming a foster parent or adopting, I didn't feel confident going from no experience with children to having a child with such a level of trauma in their past. You need to be ready and willing to help a child with different needs if you want to be a foster or adoptive parent.\n\nETA hit send too soon: the amount of people who say \"just adopt\" infuriate me. I conceived a child via IVF and I would like a 2nd. Once my first is older, I may decide to adopt, but it will be a decision made only if I feel confident that I'll be ready for addressing the needs of an adopted child.", "Former foster kid here and you couldn't be more right. Thanks for posting, its honestly super rare to come across people who understand what that experience looks like, and rarer to find someone who's working to help those kids out. Much appreciation, keep up the good work, I know it means the world to the kids you volunteer with.", "Thank you for doing what you do. I have so much admiration for people like you.\nAll the best and warm wishes to you. \u2764\ufe0f", "Honest question since you work with foster kids. If there is a child in a circumstance like this, where there\u2019s absolutely no family to take over care, and there\u2019s a foster available who is willing to take the child in long term with potential adoption, does the system allow this or do they just make the kid go in and out of homes no matter what? I ask this because I plan on becoming a foster parent someday.", "I\u2019ve wanted to sign up to be a GAL but I\u2019m lost on how to/where to go for training. Any tips?", "Agreed. But that's not just true for this child, that's true for all children", "The child more than likely already has PTSD from losing her parents in a car accident. Being placed with a woman who does not want her would only make that worse!", "A resentful mother us absolutely not better than foster care/adoption. Might even be worse. Resentful parents are absolutely traumatizing.", "But OP is _not_ keen to raise the proof of her husband\u2019s infidelity. That cannot be emotional safe for that girl. Not a clean slate or living him in this instance.", "I agree everyone acting like foster care is great.A lot of people are just in it for money not even counting other horrible things that happen to kids in the system.", "Funny, but half siblings are also family. They also don't step up.", "Maybe they did not have anyone or could not even imagine to both die while the child is so young.", "no kidding - EMIL didn't just ask her, she's putting her through a horriblly manipulative guilt trip about it and even blaming OP for her son cheating. Of course it's unfathomable that EMIL lost her only child, but a grieving asshole is still an asshole.", "Nobody in the maternal family wants the child.", "Then she needs to harass them", "Seems to me that if any living person is the asshole it's them then. But realistically the biggest assholes here are dead.", "The child had a father also. I was wondering if all the father's side was hit up too", "It's bad enough that she knows she won't be able to do it and gets worse every year. She's been declining for about 7 years now and I definitely see her declining.", "She hasn't got ten years of caring for anyone in her. I'd be shocked if she doesn't need to hire help for herself or go into assisted living in the next couple of years.", "I don't know that it would be.", "I never would. She is not my child or a member of my family so there's nothing that would make me track her down or change my mind.", "If you were able to prevent their entry into foster care I'm betting that you had a pre-existing relationship with them.  So, 0.  You are trying to guilt-trip OP into taking a child with whom she not only has no relationship, but who carries strong negative associations for her.  Literally any random stranger's child would have a better chance of having a good life with OP and there are thousands of them in foster care right now.", "I understand what you're saying. If they had ever expressed any love or interest in her, I'd encourage them to keep that. But even when they lived under the same roof as her they were not involved and didn't spend any actual time with her. They have never shown any kind of connection and I don't believe in forcing that. If they don't love her, they don't, and I don't want to push them on having a relationship they don't want. I have always, within reason, let them maintain and choose their own relationships.", "I agree! It's a horrible situation for the child, but it's unfair to ask OP to leave with a constant reminder of what her ex and his new wife did to her in her house! EMIL should understand that and should ask her neices, nephews, cousins etc for help instead of harassing OP. NTA!", "[removed]", "I had the same experience and opted for IVF for the same reasons. We ended up having twins. Fast forward 8 years and I know my support network wasn't strong enough to adopt.", "Absolutely! Training is done from the Guardian Ad Litem staff after you interview/background check and are selected to move forward with training (this is based off my state/district and the exact process may vary). So to start the process all you do is go to the guardian ad litem website for your state and fill out the request to volunteer form. They will reach out to you and get everything set up from there!", "From this point of view if OP had an obligation to foster a child it would be better satisfied by any child other than this one, because presumably OP is more able to give a good home to a child that they do not associate with infidelity.", "It\u2019s remarkably more true for foster kids. To the extent that my daughter knows several kids that were sexually trafficked as a result of being in foster care. \n\nDoesn\u2019t make OP the AH. I don\u2019t think I could do it. If I were grandma I\u2019d start reaching out to people that post ads begging for a family. It feels icky, but you gotta start somewhere that might get results. Granddaughter is still very little and is sadly more marketable now since she hasn\u2019t endured the trauma of foster care. Once that happens, she\u2019s just another minnow in a sea of others just like her.", "Because MIL believes OP will be easier to break than the others.", "They are all kids themselves. You really think they should?", "You\u2018re expecting a bunch of teenagers to step up and raise another child? How? With no future perspectives? Please explain.", "They are all MINORS!!!", "that's on them though - it's a parents responsibility and all children deserve to have willing godparents. \n\nIf you don't have a single friend or family member willing to step up in a tragedy like this, you've failed as a parent to provide your child with a basic social safty net.", "agreed. she\u2019s definitely not punishing the child, and she\u2019s NTA. \n\ni think i missed something. i know OP\u2019s ex/father of this child has passed. what happened to the child\u2019s mother?", "It was the affair that destroyed the chances OP would feel genuine fondness for her though. In a world where OP's ex didn't cheat and instead they divorced amicably, OP might have been more willing to be a bonus/adoptive mom since she wouldn't be associating the child with the affair she was born from.", "And yet if anyone has an obligation to her it's them and not you.  There are thousands of children out there with a better claim to be raised by you (and me, and anyone), because \"no claim at all\" is better than this.", "The ex was an only child", "She said in the post that her ex husband was an only child. So it sounds like EMIL is the only family on the father\u2019s side.", "Don't you think the mil would have tried that first?", "The child is going into foster care", "\ud83d\ude22", "You\u2019re not such a good reader. I said I would take the child. It\u2019s the internet, and it\u2019s an opinion. That\u2019s how it works.", "[removed]", "10/10", "Thank you!! Your username doesn\u2019t check out, and I\u2019m for one happy about it.", "No she thinks that if harassed OP enough then she will do what she wants.  Ex MIL doesn't care that this child is going to be a constant reminder of what her ex did to her.  I'm sure it took OP a while to get over the hurt this AH did to her only for this child to bring it all back up.  It is absolutely not this child's fault but unfortunately she is a reminder to OP and her children of what happened.", "You really think that being raised by someone who will see the betrayal and infidelity of their spouse every time they look at you; someone who has already raised their own children to almost adult ages and would have to start child rearjng again from toddler-hood, would be a good choice for this child, just because their siblings share some DNA?\n\nShe absolutely should not take that child.", "She has three teenagers.. have you actually thought that perhaps she\u2019s content with three as a single parent. \nThat maybe she cannot afford another child, wouldn\u2019t have time for a small child?\nIt would be worse to take on a child she simply cannot look after, not to mention she\u2019s nothing to do with her and she has every right to say no.\nOf course it\u2019s sad, it\u2019s terribly sad for the little girl. Heartbreaking. But sadly we can\u2019t always do things no matter how great it seems because in reality that\u2019s not always the case.", "So, a women's right to her own reproductive autonomy is being eroded. Now, women must take responsibility for a child which she was in no way a part of bringing into this world? JUST NO!!! Not her circus. Not her monkeys. Not her problem!", "honestly the cheating parents are also assholes for having a child without planning for godparents.", "I have an outlined plan for who is going to take my cat if I die. Is the responsible thing to do if you have a living thing dependent on you", "Absolutely agree with you. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "So that ex had no aunts, Uncle's or cousins? It was just him and his mom only?", "Maybe not. She might have thought it was easier to go to OP playing the sibling card. There is no mention of how MIL was with OP and her children during the divorce and subsequently after. Either way, it should be up to the caseworker 2 to find family to place the child with. I'm just looking at it as someone who would never just try to force my child or grandchild onto someone who said no repeatly.\n\nETA. There is nothing wrong with her asking. The wrong is not taking no for an answer and then involving Ops child.", "That is how it works.  My opinion is that you are trying to guilt-trip OP.  I have a number of other opinions about you as a consequence, but I'm sure you can easily deduce these.", " It's sad the child doesn't have anyone but there are hundreds of thousands of children who have nobody and you are just as responsible for them as you are for this child.", "The only reason it makes it slightly worse is her decision does involve separating the child from her existing siblings.", "These things don't really cancel eachothers out. We can all just speculate. It really doesn't matter what reasons the MIL has. Whatever the reason is OP still has no obligation to take the kid in and it's still a horrible situation for the kid.", "The grandma should step up to take care of the child.  It's her grandchild.  And her son's assets are with her.  Not that she's going to give OP the dead couple's assets.", "Yes, as far as they know anyway.", "Probably", "It doesn\u2019t sound like she has much, if any, relationship with them now.", "Half siblings who admitted to not caring about her, putting the child into a situation where not a single person wants or cares about her existence is objectively a bad idea.", "The existing siblings do not want a relationship with her.", "The case worker would have better access to records about existing family. How are you doing, OP? This whole scenario can not be easy on you. By whole scenario, I'm talking about the cheating and then on.", "I mean, foster care is also a situation where not a single person wants her or cares about her existence.", "Depending on how long she stays in foster care. I am VERY aware of the system. If she gets adopted by a loving family (despite how complicated the system likes to be), she could find genuine community. But she also might not. At least it's a gamble versus going into a house where you're guaranteed to not be loved."]}
