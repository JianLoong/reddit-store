{"id": 14527, "submission_id": "12ij028", "title": "AITA for losing it with my former MIL and saying I don't want to help her granddaughter?", "selftext": "My ex-husband died 6 months ago. We were divorced for three years prior to that after he cheated on me for about six years with the woman he married after our divorce. Ex and I share three children together. A 17 year old son, 16 year old daughter and 15 year old daughter. Ex got his second wife pregnant while we were married which is how the affair got revealed in the first place. I kicked him out and cut ties except for semi-civil co-parenting. I have never had anything to do with his daughter who is now 3.\n\nAfter my ex died my former MIL took her in temporarily. She's in poor health and my ex was her only child. The mother of the child had no family who was willing to take her. So she wanted to try and keep her out of foster care. My former MIL asked me about two months ago to consider raising her granddaughter seeing as she is the half sibling of my children. I told her I did not want to do that. She spoke to my children and they refused to ask me on her behalf. She suggested that my children might want to keep her in their family and how could I deny them that chance. So I asked my children if they had any thoughts or plans to take her on once any of them were 18. They all said no. My son said his grandma had mentioned that to him but he didn't care. My girls share a similar sentiment (though she did not ask them directly). Former MIL reached out again and I told her my answer was still no.\n\nShe suggested that her granddaughter is my family and I cut her off and said that is not true. I told her I am not the child's mother, stepmother, aunt or anything that would imply family.\n\nShe told me she will need to let the case worker know in the coming weeks that she needs a foster home if I can't take her. She told me to do it for her granddaughter, that she's innocent, how can I not love her (and rambled on a lot about that). I lost my cool, snapped at her and told her I don't want to help her granddaughter and foster care is the best place for her if she can't raise her. Former MIL told me I was a horrible evil woman and that it was no wonder my children didn't care about their sister when I had that attitude about her and she hoped one day it wouldn't come back to bite me in the ass.\n\nAITA for the way I spoke to her and for what I said about her granddaughter?\n\nETA: Ex and his wife/aka the mother of the child died. It was a car crash.

Yes, the child is a half sibling to your children, but that does not create an obligation on your part. Some people are able to take on roles like your ex MIL is suggesting, and some people can\u2019t/won\u2019t. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Your EMIL needs to back off. This was her choice, now she can deal with it.", "NTA.  It is INSANE for the ex-MIL to try to rope you into this.  You went above and beyond even talking to your kids about this.  The child has been dealt a shitty hand, and I hope she isn\u2019t failed by the foster system.", "NTA. She\u2019s not your family and you have no obligations to her or your ex-MIL. \n\nYou sound like a good parent with solid boundaries.", "NTA. Say you did raise this child. How could this be the best option for them if every time you looked at them you\u2019d be reminded of the past events that happened? Say you did form some type of bond, would it ever be genuine other than for feeling guilt? That\u2019s not best case for the child and that\u2019s a fair assessment I think. There are people out there who can\u2019t have children who\u2019d probably love the option to adopt a small child and have the means to care for them. They would be there in the best interest of the child. Is foster care ideal? Maybe not, but that\u2019s not your responsibility as you did not conceive the child so you shouldn\u2019t feel guilty for voicing your opinion to your Ex MIL.", "NTA\n\nIf she wants to take her granddaughter in, she may do so. She doesn't have the right to bully you into doing so or try and go through your children to persuade you.", "NTA. So your ex-MIL wants you to raise the ultimate result of your late ex husband's affair just out of the goodness of your heart? Hell, Jesus himself didn't have a heart that big.\n\nNot to mention the time, effort and expense of raising another whole human being. She's desperate, understandably, but that's not a reason to disrespect your VERY reasonable boundaries.", "NTA, \n\nThe kid is innocent, but you do not know her and I think her presence will remind you of what happened. It will not be good for either of you.", "NTA but where's the mom in this?", "NTA - I can maybe see her asking you but you were CLEAR that you answer was unequivocally no.", "Sad for the child- she will pay the price for the poor decisions of her parents, but you are under no obligation to take responsibility for the child. NTA.", "NTA - though it\u2019s sad what\u2019s happening, it\u2019s not your responsibility to care for the daughter of another person. The fact that your ex MIL is trying to guilt you into caring for her is disgusting. If the child\u2019s own mother and her, who is literally related to the child, cannot care for that little girl, why are you who has no blood with her be expected to care for her? Some people are seriously twisted in the head.", "NTA. Your MIL is trying to guilt you into raising a child that you do not have a connection to and that's not fair. It is sad for the child that she lost both of her parents. But she needs a family that will love and appreciate her for the little joy she is. Understandably, you are not that person for several reasons. \n\nOne is, your kids are teenagers and you're close to being an empty-nester. Starting over at this point would be a huge life change for you, one that you are clearly not willing to make. Secondly, her existence was a catalyst for the end of your marriage. She doesn't need to grow up with that hanging over her head.", "NTA. This is a horrible situation but she's not your responsability. I understand that your ex MIL wants to keep her close and \"in the family\" so she can keep seeing her. And foster care has a really bad reputation atleast where I live. But the kid is not related to you in any way. You barely know about her.", "I understand you. your children have no bond to her, and for obvious reasons neither do you. \n\nsorry for the kid but the child's family is failing on her, not you\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA kid isn't your problem and why would you want a constant reminder that your husband cheated on you living in your house?", "NTA . On paper, it would be the charitable thing to do in such a horrible situation, but there is no way you should feel obliged to take the girl in, especially given who her parents are.", "NTA\nAnd it might be time to limit the access grandmother has to your children if she's pressuring them this way. It's sad the child doesn't have anyone but there are hundreds of thousands of children who have nobody and you are just as responsible for them as you are for this child. Granny is overstepping here and she needs to back off fast.", "NAH\n\nI don't blame you for not taking her in. She is not your responsibility.\n\nI don't blame your ex-MIL for being desperate to protect her grandchild. The system is, ironically, no place for a child.\n\nPerhaps take comfort from the fact that, if the situation was reversed, she'd be trying every trick in the book to keep your kids out of the system.", "NAH.  You are completely within your rights to say no, and I don\u2019t blame you.  At the same time, I cannot fault a grieving mother for fighting tooth and nail to try to protect her grandchild from being abused in the foster care system. This is an awful situation all around.", "NTA - Your ex caused the relationship your kids have with their half-sister and that side of the family. It's not your fault they view things that way. I don't know if it was mentioned, but why can't the mother take care of her?", "NTA. People need to remember that an affair is a very painful thing for the person being cheated on. The child is the evidence of the years long affair. I only speak for myself by saying that I don't want to be reminded of betrayal. I am not going to pick up the pieces of the betrayal either. Sounds horrible but I wouldn't even want to be in the same room as the child for a long time.", "Instead of haranging you, your ex-MIL should contact the second wife's family to see what options are available for this child's care. If there's no one on that side of the family, foster care will have to do. As someone said earlier, if you can't (understandably) open your heart, there's no need to open your door. NTA.", "You have 0 responsibility towards that child so your NTA.  However, I hope your kids have some type of sentiment towards that child. Its not her fault their dad cheated.", "NAH. You're not obligated to take her, but I understand the grandmother trying to make sure the child is taken care of, even if she is crossing boundaries by going to your kids after you put up boundaries", "NTA - It's your life and you're under no obligation, but you can't really blame the MIL for trying.  She obviously cares for her 3 year old granddaughter but isn't capable of taking care of herself.\n\nFoster care vs an actual stable family.  It's a no brainer since foster care is typically consigning the kid for a brutal life, the innocent 3 year old is literally living worst case scenario: Father and Mother pass away, no family can take them, so they're thrown into the annals of a horrific system.\n\nThere's also the idea that \"blood is thicker than water\".  Your kids right now don't care about her, but later on in life, knowing they had a half sister disappear on them into a system they could have saved her from could lead to regrets (could have been Hero's).\n\nIt's a horrible situation, I'm so sad for the little girl.", "NAH (apart from your cheating ex). His daughter is not your family. It's doesn't sounds like your kids are that close to her either.\n\nWhile I do feel sorry for the poor girl there are many kids who have lost their parents and you are no more responsible for her that you are for any of them. Foster care isn't good I know, but is it any better to be taken in by your fathers ex who is going to resent you?\n\nI'm saying NAH rather than N-T-A because I can't really fault her grandmother for being desperate to keep her grandchild out of the system, particularly after she's lost her son.", "NAH. I am sorry for what happened. But you are entitled to not take her in. But cant really fault your former MIL for trying so much since she is trying to protect her grandchild.", "What a no win situation. \n\nOP, if you can\u2019t open your heart, there is no point opening your door. \n\nThis child has lost both her parents and soon will lose their grandmother. I can\u2019t even imagine what this child is going through. I can only hope she is lucky enough to have foster parents who actually care about her. Maybe even adopt her. \n\nAgape \ud83d\udc95", "NAH\n\nit's a grabdmother trying to protect her grandchild, the last memory of her only child (but former MIL is slightly the AH here because she shouldn't dump this on you and harass you or your kids)\n\nYou are not obligated to take the kid. If you are not going to love her and care for her, you wouldn't be any better than the system.", "So this whole time you never mentioned the kids mom died too?", "You\u2019re NTA but I probably would take her if I had the financial means to do so. It\u2019s your life and your choice 100%, though.", "Why would the caveat for taking in the child be that your kids would have to raise her when they turn 18? Of course they will say \u201cno\u201d to that. If you really don\u2019t want her permanently, why not foster her? If you do take her in permanently then take dull responsibility and see if there is anything left in your ex\u2019s estate or life insurance that could go towards her care.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
