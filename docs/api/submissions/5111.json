(This info is important to note) it doesn\u2019t actual swivel, it just leans back a little, like how you would sit in a bean bag. I come outside with our hot cocoas and go to hand him his, he takes it out of my hands, still leaning back in the chair. I go to sit down in another chair on our patio, and he tells me he didn\u2019t want whip cream and that I should\u2019ve known that because when does he ever get whip cream on drinks (we go to Starbucks a little too much). I replied \u201coh I didn\u2019t realize, can you just drink it like that or is it really a big deal\u201d to which he got irritated with. And as he went to sit up to respond, he spilt the entire hot cocoa on himself. He quickly stood up and proceeded to tell me \u201cit was my fault and that I shouldn\u2019t have handed him the drink while he was leaned back in the chair because how would he be able to sit up\u201d I didn\u2019t say anything, which further pissed him off and told me to clean up the mess while he went to shower. I didn\u2019t clean the mess up, I left it there for him because I was just so upset about how I put all this effort into making these drinks for him to not even say thank you.

If so, then you need to consider stepping away for awhile. Your husband is acting childish thinking that he can get away with something by blaming it towards others and not getting what he wants.", "Nta. Your 2 year old sounds like a real ahole.\n\nHe could have gotten up and continued the chat inside instead of lazily being outside...surfing phone? Then he rudely admonishes you for putting whipped cream on there. Unless he has an allergy, that is easily scooped off and can take the slight calorie and taste hit to just enjoy someone caring for you. Lastly, he doesn't even have the intelligence to handle a drink or use a chair. The tantrum and orders to clean it up...man I wouldn't either. Guy needs a 20 dollar plastic chair and a bib", "NTA. This is a very toxic environment if he's mad about whipped cream and blames you for his own mistake. Leave the house as soon as possible", "NTA\n\n1. If he wants it a certain way he can make it himself. \n\n2. He spilled it himself. You didn't do anything wrong.\n\n3. Flipping out over a spilled drink is a sign of anger management issues that should be addressed ASAP", "Honey.  \nHoney.\n\nYou just... you didn't... you...\n\nHoney.\n\nNTA. Get out of there.", "NTA. I'm just going to say; your husband really doesn't sound like a good guy. I could give him a pass for snapping at you a little after spilling a hot drink on himself (even though it was his own clumsiness) but ordering you around and not apologizing later just tells me that he's an ass.", "What sort of gaslighting AH spills a drink on themselves and then blames it on somebody else?\n\nNTA\n\nAlso, no, it wasn't unreasonable for you to get him whipped cream. Just because he doesn't likeit in general that doesn't rule it out on chocolate. And besides, it's an easy mistake to make and an easy fix.", "NTA\nYour husband sounds like a spoilt brat", ">**AITA for** **~~spilling hot cocoa on my husband~~****?**\n\nShould read: **AITA for my husband spilling hot coco on himself?**\n\nWhich really clears things up, right? NTA.", "NTA - You sound like a peach. He sounds like an AH.\n\nYou did something nice for him, and instead of being grateful, he was immediately rude. \u201cYou should\u2019ve known,\u201d like he\u2019s admonishing a child. Then you asked for clarification if it\u2019s a big deal or if he could still drink it, he got angry and spilled his drink on himself. Then blamed you for his own accident! He sounds petty and childish, and you\u2019re in no way at fault here.\n\nHe ruined his own chair. All over whipped cream.", "Nta. He's blaming you for his mistakes. Not cool", "OMG NTA. He got mad at you for trying to do something nice and then blamed you for him spilling on himself? That\u2019s so childish and he owes *you* an apology not the other way around.", "NTA. You made a mistake and he responded pretty rudely to it. He blamed you for his spilling misfortune and told you to clean it up, is he 5?", "NTA. I\u2019ve never heard of someone (who\u2019s not an abusive person) spilling something on themselves and lashing out at someone else for it. In one of your comments you mentioned he doesn\u2019t have an allergy to whipped cream or anything, so scooping it off the top of a freshly made drink would have taken him less time and effort than all the bitching he did.\n\nI am sorry you\u2019re married to someone who clearly doesn\u2019t value or respect you but you did nothing wrong here and I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t clean the mess your toddler, I mean husband, made.", "You\u2019re way too young to be a mum to a 29 year old", "NTA it\u2019s all him. He spilled it on himself. He took the drink from you. He doesn\u2019t like whipped cream on his hot chocolate (proof that he\u2019s the AH). Blaming you and telling you to clean it up is nonsensical and abusive.", "NTA. Your husband is clearly abusive to you though.", "NTA.", "You\u2019re NTA \nHe\u2019s the asshole. A massive one ! You did him a really nice thing and because he spilt it and can\u2019t handle he made a fool of himself he blames you.", "NTA. Ridiculous to blame you for his clumsiness. He could have taken the cup after sitting properly if that's the kind of chair he was sitting on.", "NTA but your title makes me sad. You didn't spill it, he did. You did something nice for him and he turned it into something horrible. He could have asked you to hold it while he got up, surely he had got up from that chair before?", "Oh honey... NTA. Please make sure to stand up for yourself. You're not responsible for his clumsiness. \n\nAlso - asking about the whipped cream was very reasonable from you: I'm a picky eater and my partner will sometimes forget I don't eat something. He will frequently ask whether or not I will still be able to eat it (usually though I fix it myself because I'm an adult).", " NTA!", "NTA and next time when serving him, use a sippy cup, the one with lid that you give to toddlers so that they can't spill the drink. He's one useless man if he can't even hold a cup of hot drink and then have the audacity to whine about it to his wife that its her fault because she put cream in the hot chocolate.", "NTA. Your husband is embarrassed and decided to gaslight you and blame you for his screwup. \n\nHaving grown up with someone who does that shit, this probably not the first time he\u2019s pulled this crap, is it?\n\nPersonally I\u2019d tell him he can sleep in thenfucking broken chair if he\u2019s going to be like that.", "NTA, If your husband has convinced you that you spilled cocoa on him that is very alarming to me. You did not spill anything. This is not in any way your fault. Your husband owes you an apology and some serious self-reflection.", "NTA -That criticizing and blame shifting are big red flags, too.", "Dude your husband sucks", "NTA\u2014seems like your husband is just upset about the whipped cream", "No. If anyone's the AH, it's his parents for raising a spoiled brat of a man. If he didn't want whipped cream, all he had to do was be a big boy and say \"thank you for the drink, but I don't really like whipped cream\" and maybe - if he can do such a thing without needing his little baby hand held - sort it out himself. I can't stand it when people throw tantrums over stuff like this, especially when they're aware something nice is being done for them. It's base ingratitude. \n\nAlso, he spilled it on himself. How dare he use you as a scapegoat for his own faults?\n\nYou are NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
