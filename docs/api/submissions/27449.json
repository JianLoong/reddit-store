{"id": 27449, "submission_id": "16pw7yq", "title": "AITA for cutting a date short when my date gave her instagram to the bartender while i went out for a smoke?", "selftext": "I 27(F) met 24 (F) off of tinder for our first date today. In my opinion, the date went really well at first. We had lots in common, sense of humour, life goals, she was also a light smoker, and I genuinely felt a connection I havent for a long time. \n\n   About a hour into the date, i stepped outside for a smoke. On my way out i chatted a bit with the bartender and he asked how long we have been dating and i said its our first date. For reference the bartender didnt speak more than 5 sentences to us when we first sat down although i saw him look at her more than me. She definitely couldn\u2019t have missed he was checking her out.\n\n   When i returned she told me the bartender asked for her instagram and she gave it to him. I saw her instagram, there are no photos on her page but her profile photo was a cute photo of her and she has several hundred followers and followings. It was definitely an active account she use for messaging.\n\n   I asked why she gave her contact details to another man while on a date with me and she said she did it because she feels safer giving it away and ignore than to say no. I asked if she thought it was disrespectful to her date to give her real contact info (a method for a strange man who knew we were on a date but nonetheless shot his shot to connect with her) and she said she can see how it appears disrespectful but she did it out of habit and for security and hoped i can see from her point of view. \n\n   I told her this was a red flag because she could have easily just said \u201csorry im on a date and im not interested\u201d. I felt like the excuse she gave was bs. I have been hit on by male staff while on dates before. The male staff has always backed off when i said \u201cim not interested im on a date\u201d and the odd times they haven\u2019t, ignoring and reporting to management has always worked. Plus there were at least a few dozen patrons at the restaurant so what did she have to fear from the bartender? It wasnt like a random man was hitting on us on the street!\n\n   I told her that i want a woman who can stand up for herself and i can trust to have my back and who respects me enough to not connect with strange men while on a date with me when im not looking. I know this is only the first date but shouldnt the first date be where you put your best foot forward? I dont think im too possessive or controlling or insecure. I dont care if she dates other people since we just met but is it too much to ask to want to feel respected as a person and for my time?\n\n   Shortly after that i told her I must get ready for my early shift tomorrow. She sent me a message later saying she hopes i can understand and she really did do it because of habit and safety. And tbh the whole evening left a sour taste in my mouth. I have not replied yet.\n\n   Am i in the asshole for cutting the date short because I felt disrespected by her actions?\n\nEdit:\nWhy is everyone lecturing me about the hardships of women when I am a woman and i am fully aware of it?! I know how we curve men in ways to maximize safety. I can confidently say the overall atmosphere of the restaurant and the bartender was very relaxed. At no point was the bartender\u2019s vibes off or pushy before and after my absence which is why my bs meter was ringing.", "created_utc": 1695447556, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16pw7yq/aita_for_cutting_a_date_short_when_my_date_gave/", "score": 612, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She gave an explanation that you may or may not like or believe. You are not an AH for that also. But you are AH for giving a lecture after that. For god\u2019s sake it was a first date. If you don\u2019t like her, don\u2019t go for the second date. Your lecture sounds like possessiveness and red flag.", "I say YTA. Such a loaded sentence \u201cI want a woman who can stand up for herself and have my back\u201d and like you said you just met. You were quite attentive with the glances the bartender was giving your date and her instagram details about using it as a way of active messaging for someone who doesn\u2019t care too much. I personally give out my snapchat or instagram for safety because it\u2019s easier to block people rather than phone number. It has also became a habit of mine. Like an automatic response to men. Like clockwork. Sad really. She also took the time to message you still to explain, if not green flag then beige flag atleast.", "I thought it was harmless. She didn't give him her phone number. Trading IG accounts can be pretty innocent. You were on a first date, so it's not like you have anything invested in this yet.  She's not your girlfriend. She didn't do anything wrong. Maybe she was raised to be polite/ didn't want to hurt his feelings/, wanted to avoid conflict, and that's how she handled the situation. You don't know her well enough to think she had other intentions. I think you should give it another chance, but tbh, maybe let it go.  You sound like a red flag.", "YTA  -  you left for a smoke on the first day, and your surprised someone hit on her? How she deals with that, is her business. You came off really controlling and insecure here on the first date. Hope you learn from it", "YTA. Her explanation was valid. She even told you about it so you would know she wasn\u2019t being shady or disrespectful towards you. The bartender approached her, not the other way around. There are countless stories of women being seriously harmed or even killed after rejecting a man\u2019s advances. For all she knew he could have followed her into the parking lot after she left and confronted her. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time something like that happened. \n\nAlso leaving your  date by herself so you could smoke outside was pretty rude. How would you feel if she said: \u201cI want to be with someone who is willing to go without smoking for a few hours so they can focus on getting to know me\u201d? You wouldn\u2019t appreciate that.", "Do you think going out for a smoke an hour into your date is putting your best foot forward?", "You\u2019re the one who left in the middle of the date for a smoke break. That\u2019s rude lol.", "YTA. There are two red flags in this.\n\nThe bartender.\n\nAnd you.\n\nPoor girl, to be treated like that. At least she dodged two bullets that night.", "YTA\n\nI would do the exact same thing even if I didn't feel actively in danger, it's an avoidance strategy. Even guys that aren't scary can still very much make the rest of your date uncomfortable, but you decided to make it uncomfortable anyways.\n\nShe literally told you right away so you wouldn't feel uncomfortable. \ud83d\ude02 Someone dodged 2 bullets here and it wasn't you.", "I\u2019ve had a delivery driver enter my flat and refuse to leave until I have him my number and he called me to confirm it was real. He didn\u2019t leave the building until I called the police. Similar things have happened in pubs and bars with guys who have grabbed my phone to put their numbers in and call themselves so they have my numbers too. These days, I just give people my social media and immediately block them when they\u2019re out of sight to stay safe. I\u2019m not trying to lecture you, but there are very valid reasons for her giving her instagram out", "It\u2019s a first date \u2014 which is like the dating equivalent of a job interview, honestly. She isn\u2019t dating you yet, she\u2019s just meeting you for the first time. (You may never see her again!) People can absolutely date casually and see many people at once before deciding if something is serious. \n\nIt\u2019s absolutely fine for you to not want to date someone who does this \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t make her an asshole, it makes you two not well suited. You seem to be acting a little possessive for a first meet.", "I think YTA. \n\nAnd she didn't have to tell you but she did.", "As a heterosexual man, I am not in a position to give you advice, but one thing confused me.\r  \nEven if it's your first date, shouldn't you know each other's relationship preferences? Or shouldn't you have opened the issue after this incident?\r  \nI asked to understand.\r  \n From my point of view, people have different ways of dealing with problems. Hers method did not seem very strange to me. It was like giving a fake phone number in the past.", "YTA. I\u2019m a heterosexual male who was hit on by a guy in the grocery store. Even though I was not interested, when he asked for my contact information, I gave him my IG. When he started messaging me about hanging out I blocked and removed him. I don\u2019t see the problem with just giving out an IG account since it\u2019s easy to turn them away later. Although I agree it is a bit sour to her doing it on the first date, I believe YTA for making it a bigger situation than it was since she genuinely seemed like she did it for security and habit.", "YTA for smoking and leaving your date to something so dumb.", "YTA. It\u2019s a first date and you allowed your own insecurities to create this completely imaginary scenario where your date was more interested in some random bartender who was obviously ogling her. People like the bartender who make it so obvious they\u2019re interested and aren\u2019t shy about hitting on a girl infront of their dates are also likely the kind of people who aren\u2019t afraid of getting confrontational if things don\u2019t get their way.  The bartender made their move when you weren\u2019t around meaning she was alone, she made the smart play of giving them a social media account in this day and age social media accounts are hardly a private thing.\n\nAnd let\u2019s play devils advocate here for a second let\u2019s say she was mildly interested in the bartender, so what? Again you\u2019re on a damn first date. It\u2019s called dating!! You guys aren\u2019t monogamous and exclusive just because you guys go on one date. It is quiet common in the early stages of dating for people to date more than one person, if you were interested and felt you had a connection why not go for it anyway and have faith in yourself that she will also feel the connection and reciprocate the interest?  Relationship aren\u2019t built overnight. \n\nNo one owes anyone anything because of a singular date. You had a chance here to be confident in yourself to love yourself and have faith that others will see your value, instead you acted insecure and ruined a potential relationship. \n\nDating/mating is a ultimately a competition. It\u2019s evolution.  if you can\u2019t have faith in your own value or hold some ridiculous notion that it shouldn\u2019t be a competition because ??? than maybe you\u2019re better of staying single.", "What \u201clight smoker\u201d goes out for a cigarette an hour into a first date? No wonder she was passing out her contact info. \n\nNAH but that was a dumb move.", "I feel like 24F dodged a bullet here", "YTA you were on a first date not your honeymoon. She's free to swap details with whoever she wants! Besides it likely wouldn't have happened at all if you'd not left your date to go out for a smoke. I reckon your date has dodged a bullet. The only red flag here is YOU!", "When will people learn we can't ,and shouldn't try, to control anything another person does??!  Having healthy boundaries means if a person does x y or z we don't like, there's no drama, you just move on, you definitely don't lecture anyone about it. OP is coming across as very controlling here. YTA.", "YTA. You just met and she shared her social media not her number.", "YTA. Her reasoning is completely valid. A lot of women feel it\u2019s safer to give out a fake number or something than reject a guy outright. Especially someone who could do something to her drink if he\u2019s upset by the rejection. \n\nAlso, starting an argument over this on the first date is ridiculous. If someone offends you on a date, you don\u2019t go on a second date, but you don\u2019t start lecturing them and looking for an argument.", "YTA\n\nyou met this lassie on a dating app and were on your first date but somehow thi k she should treat you like you were in an established relationship.\n\nShe held over a social media detail to basically get the guy to leave her alone in a way that won't cause drama, but you've reacted as if she was your girlfriend and was openly flirting with someone else in front of you.\n\nYou may not think it but you were being needy, possessive, and controlling.", "Nah. You both have valid reasons for the way you behaved.", "YTA. You\u2019re having a really big reaction to this. It is absolutely inappropriate to say what you said your date because she gave someone her Instagram. If this is the type of reaction you have on a first date, I\u2019d be terrified of the reactions you would have in a relationship. I don\u2019t think she should forgive you for this to be honest, this is a huge red flag and really far from appropriate behavior. It\u2019s fine for you to be a little bit disappointed that she gave out her Instagram but that is something you take note of internally and see if it is information that impacts how you want to move forward with her. It is not okay to tell her she can\u2019t stand up for herself. You were absolutely being too possessive and insecure. This was a first date! This woman has absolutely no obligation to you in any way. If she does things you don\u2019t like, decide not to have a second date, don\u2019t attack her character.", "YTA, clear overreaction. It would also be a massive red flag if someone I dated misbehaved in the first few dates as you did. It's also possible that you feel troubled by the fact she appears to be prettier than you. Try to learn from this experience and make better choices next time.", "Kinda. As a woman we do kinda just give our insta for safety bec its easier than giving our number. Also it was only a first date she doesnt really owe you loyalty yet", "YTA. \n\nhttps://www.fox26houston.com/news/woman-hit-in-face-with-brick-in-houston-says-man-attacked-her-for-not-giving-him-her-number.amp", "YTA and you do come across as possessive and controlling. It's not at all disrespectful on her part to give her insta when on a date, when she has hundreds of followers. It's just insta, not like she swiped for him on tinder. Frankly I think she dodged a bullet when you cut the date short.", "YTA. Sounds like she dodges a bullet to be honest. Giving out your instagram is such a non issue, and her reason for giving it out makes perfect sense (the vibes dont need to feel off to YOU for her to want to avoid conflict. Also you said his vibes werent off, but you told the guy specicially you were on a date with her and then he still tried to pick her up. What vibes were you clocking?)", "YTA\n\nYes you cut the date short but not when you think you did.\n\nThe date was cut short when you left your potential girlfriend sat there alone in a restaurant. In that time somebody else came along who showed some interest in her.\n\nHell you even talked to the server yourself while you were heading outside and told him it was your first date. You literally told him right there that she was still semi available and then you left the room! Thats all the info he needed to go hit on her and you give it to him and then you gave him the opportunity to act on that info.", "There are many red flags here, unfortunately OP is the one waving them around. YTA.", "lol you are the red flag congrats", "NTA, you were on a first date, I'm female and I would consider that disrespectful to the other person.", "you\u2019re demanding a lot of expectation out of someone on your first ever date with them. it\u2019s okay to have standards but this seems intense. \n\nwhy do you feel so threatened by this bartender? what deeper insecurities are you pointing at these strangers? why are you perceiving this the way you are rather than having some level of trust that your date is telling you the truth? you don\u2019t know enough about her character from one single date to be so certain that you\u2019re right, and that she was disrespecting you. \n\nyou should probably sit with those questions i just asked you and give yourself the painfully honest answer that you don\u2019t want to accept and admit those to yourself to her and be honest. the fact that she went out of her way to reach out to you about it again and apologize when she did nothing wrong probably speaks a lot about her heart and character as a person. don\u2019t waste her time if you\u2019re going to be insecure and jealous, demanding, because it sounds like she might actually put up with it. \n\ni was not much different than you with the woman that i inevitably married. we are both women. so very similar to you. i\u2019m lucky she was so sweet and understanding of all my short comings and that i was smart enough to know that a kind and loving girl was going to have to be the thing that made me grow up as a person. i did my best to make sure her patience and understanding was valued and not wasted. \n\ni won\u2019t call you an asshole, that\u2019s not productive, i think you just need to really think hard about the entire situation and imagine yourself in her shoes, not let your hurt ego and insecurities dictate the way you\u2019ve perceived this interaction, and it\u2019ll probably help you go forward in life being able to be more at peace, understanding and loving.\n\nEDIT: spelling", "YTA\n\nIf you thought it was going well, why would you go out for a smoke? Even apart from the leaving her to smoke, you surely couldn\u2019t think someone would still want to kiss you after you have been smoking? She presumably took it as a sign that you weren\u2019t expecting it to go anywhere and so acted accordingly. \n\nAnd if not that, then she probably decided that she wasn\u2019t interested in you after realising you smoke. That would be a red flag to most people bc most people don\u2019t want to have to be around someone who smells like smoke all the time and given we have grown up with all the information about how bad smoking is for health, it\u2019s pretty fucking dumb to decide to smoke anyway.", "YTA but I get you were hurt. Sometimes people ask my instagram and I just give it to them because I don't want to be rude and it's not engaging. \n\nIf you ask for a phone number, you expect to communicate directly by text or calls which can seem more intimate.\n\nIf you ask for an instagram you don't have to text or communicate with them. \n\nWhile I do get that it's frustrating to see it and can be a bit of a cold shower I think that a lot of people don't dare to say no when asking instagram as to not appear as rude or offensive... I'm a people pleasure so I rarely say no when someone offers me to trade instagram.", "YTA her explanation was valid in my eyes. Does this woman you're on a first date with even like guys?", "NTA. I'd be pretty pissed if the woman I was on a date with gave out her Instagram handle while I wasn't in the room. Even if it's just a casual date, still seems pretty disrespectful. Also the fact that she couldn't just tell the dude \"no, I'm on a date\" or just straight up no speaks volumes about her. I prefer to date strong women. I'm assuming she's bi?", "NTA. You said it yourself that you felt she disrespected your time, so you responded with your boundaries. If you had an early shift, it makes sense that you excused yourself to go home after having a night out once it was no longer fun for you. No worries, just up to you if you want to move forward.", "YTA, she has a genuine reason to do it and a very common reason at that. This isn\u2019t some excuse, it\u2019s a matter of safety for us.", "YTA for leaving your date alone to step outside in the first place. shouldn\u2019t her time be respected and valued as well?", "Possessive OP. Girl dodged a bullet. YTA.", "NTA, I can understand kinda for the safety reasons, but giving out your social media is not an effective way of keeping yourself safe. Plus if this were a male who gave a female bartender thier social media info while he was on a date, he'd be called a dog and a cheater without question. You also have a right to feel how you feel about that situation and its understandable to feel disrespected.", "YTA. We do what we need to in order to feel safe. She told you about it, so she very clearly wasn\u2019t trying to hide it from you. Shaming another woman for how she handles being scared of a man is awful. *That\u2019s* the real red flag.", "YTA - You have absolutely np idea what her past experiences have been. Great that you can stand up for yourself and felt self. Good for YOU. It's a first date, you are the red flag here.", "YTA", "Also...in your 20's years...27 feels much different than 24 - a lot has changed in just a few years what makes her feel safe might not be the same as what you do to feel safe. I just think you have a lot of expectations that are bleeding over into a totally different person. You can do whatever you want and have whatever standards you want, but I think you're wrong in basically calling her weak and disrespectful. Very controlling incel-ish behavior. YTA", "YTA. You seem really insecure, this was beyond harmless AND it\u2019s the first date. She had her reasons, she was honest and she was still kind after you excessively called her actions a red flag.", "NTA wtf are these comments?\n\nYour lecture afterwards was a bit OTT, but generally speaking while on a date with someone you shouldn\u2019t be handing your number out to someone else (I know, it was her insta, but OP says she hasn\u2019t got pics but obv uses it to chat, so it\u2019s basically the same). It\u2019s pretty disrespectful.", "YTA only because you\u2019re trying to control how someone deals with attention on a first date. If you don\u2019t know this person at all, you should be giving them the benefit of the doubt especially when what they\u2019re saying sounds so reasonable.", "YTA. You are really something !", "NTA\nHer actions were a red flag, crying \u201csafety\u201d lets you know how she\u2019ll explain bad choices in the future", "NTA It\u2019s a crystal clear way of saying she isn\u2019t interested.", "YTA", "YTA. Get some therapy", "NTA. And I would definitely complain to management about that arsehole bartender.", "yta for cutting it short thinking that she wanted to be romantic with bartender. its just instagram, a way to communicate plus she could block him when he follows her. like she said it was safety. imagine if she said no and the bartender was not having a great day and decide to mess with your drinks bc of her rejection.", "NAH\n\nSo many people here are arguing for the girls safety but how in the hell is it safer to actually give out contact info? He didn\u2019t know who she was and she\u2019s just some rando at the bar he\u2019s working at. The only reason to give out the contact info would be to get in contact. Which he will likely do now. People in the sub are fucking dumb op. Don\u2019t listen to them.", "Uhmmm one it\u2019s a first date so chill. It\u2019s instagram not a bathroom bj. Second the guy making the drinks\u2026. Yeah just give him insta and move on. YTA. Y\u2019all are in a committed relationship, her explanation makes total sense.", "Yta you have unreasonable expectations for a first date. \n\nGiven that you hardly know her, has it occurred to you she's had specific experiences that made her decide to protect herself like that? Just because YOU don't see it as aproblem for yourself isn't relevant.", "NTA, how some find it differently is amazing. Had an ex do similar things, turned out to be a cheater.", "NTA. People need to learn a term called \"hard no\". It means when someone asks them something they don't want or shouldn't be doing they give a hard no not some beat around the bush answer. Example:  Guy says \"can I call you sometime and hang out?\" the answer should be \"I am actually seeing someone and that would not be appropriate, have a nice day\". Instead a soft no is \"I am actually busy this weekend, thanks anyways\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you see the difference? The soft no is a bunch of bullshit that leave the person asking the belief that she is just busy this weekend but maybe another time she would. Set people fucking straight and say no, not going to happen, we can't hang out don't ask, leave me alone. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would be pissed to, she should have said no I am sorry I am on a date and that would not be cool, I like this person and would not jeopardize that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fact that she needs to be told that is a huge red flag. Sorry this happened to you op.", "YTA and i hope the bartender is nicer to her", "Guarantee she will message him back when he messages her. Even though it was for her \" safety\"\nDisrespectful , if it was the opposite. Your reaction would totally be different.", "It is a little odd, but at the same time if someone acted like you have here after one date with me, I definitely wouldn\u2019t be seeing them again.\n\nWithout sounding rude, you\u2019ve met someone once who doesn\u2019t really have any loyalties to you in particular, it\u2019s just a date to see how things go and learn more about a person. With your scenario, her reasoning would be a little off if you\u2019d been consistently seeing each other but it\u2019s actually pretty fair for a first date. \n\nI won\u2019t lie either, I get that we\u2019re all here using Reddit, but the fact you\u2019ve gone on just one date, done this, and taken it to Reddit is a bit weird in itself, there shouldn\u2019t be anywhere near this level of pressure or over analysis over a first date with someone.", "I will never have a second date with someone who leaves me for a smoke break. You can't wait a couple of hours, really? YTA.", "You're NTA for cutting it short for whatever reason and they are NTA for not taking it too seriously either. The bartender however overstepped the mark by inserting themselves into a couples night out.", "YTA. You realize this is a first date and she is not your property. She can do as she pleases especially in a situation where many women have been met with violence or harassment from declining to give out their information. I doubt you will hear from her again anyway. She dodged a bullet.", "YTA. Good thing you showed your jealous and controlling behaviors plus the lack of tolerance and respect for someone\u2019s sense of safety right off the bat so she can avoid you in the future. \n\nYTA.", "NTA. \n\nGoing a bit against the grain. I don\u2019t feel as strongly about it but its definitely weird imo. \n\nI also would find it a bit much to be around someone who constantly felt that unsafe. There isn\u2019t anything inherently wrong with that but obviously that mindset is incompatible with you.", "If she already has hundreds of followers/followings - this one random dude doesn\u2019t matter either lol. Gotta think of the entire situation \ud83d\udc4d", "Rooting for her and the bartender tbh", "Seems a bit unfair to judge someone elses way of putting off potential suitors by your own metric. \n\n\nJust because you feel safe doing that doesnt mean she does. You can say its BS because of how you feel. You arent her, you dont know how she felt in that moment or how the guy was in that moment. Plus she told you upfront? Like you didnt coax it out of her, she was honest throughout? YTA\n\n\nAlso, \"definitely used for messaging\" or its just an account she lets randos follow her on and never interacts with? Do you message her on it? Seems an odd assumption to make because it has a profile picture and no others. It probably just pulled from facebook lol", "there are women who are killed for saying no to men. even women who say \u201cno i have a boyfriend.\u201d can get attacked. i understand the discomfort but saying \u201ci want a woman who can stand up for herself and have my back.\u201d is insensitive considering women do decline men and many still get harassed or attacked or worst case scenario, killed. soft yta for that line.", "NTA for how you felt,  but YTA for overreacting, lecturing her, and overall def controlling. It was a first date. Trading instas are normal.", "NTA and some of these comments are insane. What she did was inappropriate while on a date, and the excuse of \"safety\" makes zero sense as giving out personal details creates less safety, not more. She showed you a lot about herself based on how she handled that situation, and I think you were right to cut the date short.", "I feel like many of you haven\u2019t used instagram before and honestly shouldn\u2019t be commenting. Fact it is extremely rude to give your number out/contact info while on a date unless it\u2019s a business inquiry etc. why does this even have to be explained?

As op said they re in a actual restaurant and not on the street so the date doesn\u2019t have a concern for safety since there are dozens of people around and odds that bartender immediately starts assaulting date are slim to none.

To start I think you\u2019re entitled to feeling disrespected by your date giving out a method of contact to someone else if the signs of their intentions you mentioned were actually there.

That standard of respect you expect doesn\u2019t make you controlling like people are saying it just highlights your personal preferences and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.

In my opinion, the date went really well at first. We had lots in common, sense of humour, life goals, she was also a light smoker, and I genuinely felt a connection I havent for a long time. \n\nAbout a hour into the date, i stepped outside for a smoke. On my way out i chatted a bit with the bartender and he asked how long we have been dating and i said its our first date. For reference the bartender didnt speak more than 5 sentences to us when we first sat down although i saw him look at her more than me. She definitely couldn\u2019t have missed he was checking her out.\n\nWhen i returned she told me the bartender asked for her instagram and she gave it to him. I saw her instagram, there are no photos on her page but her profile photo was a cute photo of her and she has several hundred followers and followings. It was definitely an active account she use for messaging.\n\nI asked why she gave her contact details to another man while on a date with me and she said she did it because she feels safer giving it away and ignore than to say no. I asked if she thought it was disrespectful to her date to give her real contact info (a method for a strange man who knew we were on a date but nonetheless shot his shot to connect with her) and she said she can see how it appears disrespectful but she did it out of habit and for security and hoped i can see from her point of view. \n\nI told her this was a red flag because she could have easily just said \u201csorry im on a date and im not interested\u201d. I felt like the excuse she gave was bs. I have been hit on by male staff while on dates before. The male staff has always backed off when i said \u201cim not interested im on a date\u201d and the odd times they haven\u2019t, ignoring and reporting to management has always worked. Plus there were at least a few dozen patrons at the restaurant so what did she have to fear from the bartender? It wasnt like a random man was hitting on us on the street!\n\nI told her that i want someone i can trust to have my back and who can stand up for herself and who respects me enough to not connect with strange men while on a date with me when im not looking. I know this is only the first date but shouldnt the first date be where you put your best foot forward? I dont think im too possessive or controlling or insecure. I dont care if she dates other people since we just met but is it too much to ask to want to feel respected as a person and for my time?\n\nShortly after that i told her I must get ready for my early shift tomorrow. She sent me a message later saying she hopes i can understand and she really did do it because of habit and safety. And tbh the whole evening left a sour taste in my mouth. I have not replied yet.\n\nAm i in the asshole for cutting the date short because I felt disrespected by her actions?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "You are both on Tinder what did you expect?  A normal good person.

Somehow ppl didn\u2019t catch OP was a woman and started womansplaining, hilarious.\n\nAs for the topic, I\u2019d go to a couple more dates and assess if it\u2019s a thing or not. It\u2019s a bit too big of an assumption for the first date, but you have a right to be offended by whatever you like, so NTA", "NTA. I think you could've handled it more gracefully, I don't think her intent was to humiliate you. However, it is her responsibility to set boundaries for herself...", "NTA I see no problem with cutting a date short if you think you're not a good match especially if it's the first one", "NTA I wouldn't of even have given her as much time as you did after that. I'd of been out too. Keep your bs radar on pal. I kept mine on and have a star of a gf now.", "YTA. What exact purpose were you after when you tried to lecture her? Like, are you so desperate for a date that you prefer to tell the other off ON YOUR FIRST DATE?? I mean, are you even conscious of how pathetic was your behaviour? Because it was really pathetic. It doesn't matter if it was a red flag or not. The point is that you were willing to fight on a first effing date. You are the red flag.", "NTA - I ain't dating anyone that gives out their Instagram to randoms. Dudes only want that account to try to get laid.", "NTA. \n\nHow does giving her personal contact info make her \u2018safe\u2019?\n\nYes, it\u2019s \u2018just\u2019 Instagram but it gives the bartender access to her, and tells the bartender she\u2019s not really interested in you. She could have said no thank you I\u2019m on a date right now. And if she was interested in him she could have gone back to the bar. \n\nIt makes no sense if she felt unsafe to give out her IG. \n\nHuge red flag. No second date and don\u2019t worry about it.", "Nit an asshoke but more up front. You sound more together and KNOW what you want over others. You may have higher expected feel down bc it's not matched. \n\nGo on several more dates and see if hit continues.

Didn't go crazy trying to defend herself or push the blame around. Being unsafe denying advances is a pretty well-known problem for women at this point. So her story checks out.\n\nI'd say go foe that second date, but make it a boundary you don't want xrossed. If she crosses it after knowing the boundary, then you can wash your hands knowing you made an honest attempt.\n\nNAH.", "Its a little weird i guess. But I (F) have been with my girlfriend for 13 years and if she gave her instagram to the bartender while i was out for a smoke I\u2019d probably just laugh because he\u2019s got no chance.

Even if you think it was a safe environment and your experiences have been good in that respect, maybe your date had an awful experience before even in a supposed safe environment or even a traumatic experience.\n\nAt first I thought that she was flirting behind your back and that would be awful, but maybe instead of reacting that way, maybe you could have asked if she had had bad situations before.

She probably feels like she had a lucky escape after getting that grilling", "I can argue this both ways and I think the way the OP presented it was pretty fair to the date\u2019s perspective.\n\nI think neither\u2019s really the asshole here. I just think we\u2019ve got two people with different approaches and, considering it was a first date and assuming honesty by all parties, it\u2019s one of those things to note for future reference but not a disqualifying action.\n\nI do think, though, at this point, you let it go. It was a first date. Assume your date is acting in good faith with her explanation, and then let it go. You expressed your objection to it and suggested an alternative way of handling that sort of thing in the future. So, give her a chance to demonstrate a different approach now that she knows how you feel about it. \n\nIf you otherwise liked her (and the fact that she reached back out after suggests that she probably liked you\u2014it\u2019s Tinder, why give AF otherwise?), apologize\u2014and not because you were wrong, but because you needed time to process and want to disarm the situation\u2026 I\u2019d say something like \u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry. I just needed some time to think about how I felt about that, consider your explanation, etc. and I realized you were just doing what you thought was best in the situation. It felt weird to me, not because you were wrong but because it\u2019s not how I\u2019ve ever approached that situation and I needed to process it a bit.\u201d\n\nThat approach, IMO, disarms all of it and allows everyone to start fresh, if everyone wants to give it a second go. \n\nBest of luck! :)", "YTA. as a woman, it\u2019s actively insane that once you heard that she \u201cfelt safer giving it away than saying no\u201d you still tried to make this about you. it\u2019s just instagram and she\u2019s literally a stranger. grow up.", "YTA.

To me it just sounds like she has issues with standing up for herself or maybe some past trauma where she feels like it is just easier to give somebody what they want instead of standing up and saying no thank you.
