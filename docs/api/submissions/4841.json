So, basically, it\u2019s okay if you spend that money on eating out with them, but it isn\u2019t okay if they use that money to buy a gift for their mother\u2026? What kinda entitlement is that?\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re a good coparent, and you\u2019re NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou were trying to be kind. I had to scroll back up again to see their ages. If they were 18+ with jobs then sure I\u2019d see where you might not assume they need help. But it makes sense a 12 & 15 yr old might need money for their mom\u2019s Xmas gift", "No not the asshole. I think it\u2019s perfectly acceptable and a great thing to be resourceful and allocate money towards the things that are important to you. If buying a gift is more important to you than eating from restaurants, then go ahead and buy the gift. This could even be a good teaching moment for your daughters about personal finance! Happy holidays :)\n\nEdit: if you do make this a teaching moment, be sure to tell them that this is your money and so you can allocate it how you like. You seem to value this gift more than eating out, so tell them that", "NTA, your girls are being brats. You can be a good saver and still splurge at Christmas. Especially for their MOTHER.", "NTA, also teenagers and their attitudes can really suck sometimes.", "NTA.\n\nI've got 2 boys of a similar age. I do almost the same thing. Despite the issues I and my ex-wife have with each other it's about making Christmas for the kids a good experience and that includes them having something to give their other parent. My ex doesn't reciprocate, but that's on her.\n\nI give them $30 each (or they can combine to get one larger gift) that they can use on it's own or to supplement their allowance/earnings.  A few weeks before Christmas I take them shopping, buy cards and we wrap the gifts together.\n\nYou're doing the right thing, even if your kids don't get it now.", "NTA, this is very thoughtful and generous and your daughters are being jerks about it. Hopefully, they'll be embarrassed by behaving so selfishly when they're older and more mature (I say selfish bc instead of being happy about being able to get their mom an extra nice gift, they thought about themselves and dinners out).", "NTA - Giving your daughters money to buy their mom a gift is demonstrating many life lessons. It demonstrates the value of honoring a person who positively contributes to their life; someone you use to be married to. It demonstrates you can no longer be in a relationship and still value a person. You gifting the money enables them to pick items they want to select to honor and make their mom happy.  Although they are not little kids, at 12 and 15 years they are still minors. It seems the grudge they hold about not eating out w/your family is contributing to them dismissing your money. A self-centered interesting power play.  Best to you.", "NTA you are trying to teach your daughters to be kind.", "NTA", "I don\u2019t really get what the problem is here.

You were only being kind.", "NTA you wanted to do something nice and it got lost in the parent to  teen translation. A lot of things can come off the wrong way a this age, from both parties.

They are upset you aren't spending extra money on them, to the extent that they'll turn down help to pay for a gift for their mother?

They are not little kids but they are minors (age 12, 15) without jobs?", "NTA. That seems like a fairly normal thing to budget for gifts and if kids don't have jobs to help them buy gifts for their parents so they can be involved in the holiday.", "NTA - you were doing something nice for your daughters and your ex. It's a strange reaction on their part", "NTA. Honestly I thought it was going to be the girlfriend that was mad\u2026", "NTA.  They're coming off as greedy or at least not understanding what it means to sacrifice in order to out others first.\n\nTake the $100 back and buy your ex-wife a nice gift.  I'd give each girl a lump of coal.", "NTA\n\nBut that makes the gift from you, not them.\nThey have been raised well.\n\nYou can buy her a gift yourself.", "Info - is there a reason why *you* didn\u2019t take them to get your ex a present? You\u2019re putting the burden on the child to find time and transportation to go get a present. And if mom does it then it loses the surprise appeal.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My dad got laid off in 2008  (I was 13) and we almost lost our house. We ate almost exclusively clearance section stuff in the back of Kroger (dented cans and other processed stuff). We never ate out.\n\n$100 wouldn\u2019t be enough for a birthday party (maybe a small one). Hell for a family of 4 that could easily be a single dinner out. $100 isn\u2019t enough for a whole lifestyle change. But $100 is enough to make your mom\u2019s day special. And I promise you that if 2008 me was given the same opportunity I would have gladly picked my mom out something beautiful, because I love her so much and she always worked so hard. I would not be stomping my feet and complaining that I\u2019d rather go to Olive Garden instead.\n\nThey\u2019re not necessarily terrible children, but it\u2019s absolutely bratty behavior.", "Could the issue be that they are referring to you and just them when they mention \u201cout to eat\u201d? Do you ever do anything with just them?", "Possibly! I think it was something about giving the kids the money instead of getting the gift himself, or about how the kids seem to think he's prioritizing their mother over them.

Just write your name on it (maybe gf too if appropriate but not the kids). I'd run it past your gf so it doesn't create any issues with spending 100 on the ex. My suggestion is a massage, beauty salon type thing or something related to a hobby of hers.\n\nDon't know why your kids are being difficult about getting their mom a present. Does someone else usually organise it with them?\n\nAre you spending time with just your kids (no gf and her kids)? They may be feeling excluded/left behind?", "*afterwards*", "You made assumptions and wrote them in at least to me a hostile way. Maybe just ask if the kids had the means to pick up a present on their own and not assume the teenagers are helpless."]}
