Block him and move on", "NTA\n\nThis is the best outcome, him not attending. Because if he attends he will absolutely propose to his girlfriend in the middle of your wedding. Even if he apologizes & attends, he will be planning on taking exactly what he wants because he believes he is entitled to get whatever he wants. That\u2019s why he acted the way he did. He immediately sees him as the victim for you daring to not just give him everything he wants. \n\nDo not let him weasel his way back in & have someone in charge of keeping an eye out for him at the wedding.", "NTA and I'd rethink this friendship of yours...", "Nta your friend is throwing a tantrum. It sucks he won\u2019t be at the wedding but also good because it sounds like you can\u2019t trust him accepting your no. \n\nWhat he wants is selfish and rude. He wants to use your wedding instead of him putting in the work and money himself. Don\u2019t fall for his cry baby actions. Also, spill the beans if his gf asks you why you\u2019re no longer friends", "YOUR wedding is exclusively YOURS and your wife-to-be.  It doesn't belong to your friend.   If he doesn't get it, you're probably well rid of him.", "NTA. He could propose afterwards when everyone\u2019s gone though, the view will still be there . Unless he wants the attention", "NTA", "NTA. Your best friend is being a selfish dick about this. I desperately hope for the sake of his girlfriend and everybody else involved that he realizes and either apologizes and corrects course (if this is not generally in character for him) or grows the hell up (if it is).\n\nYou and your fiance wanting to talk it over seriously before answering, doing so and coming back with a gentle no? That is the height of honest, fair maturity.", "NTA\n\nThe one good thing your friend did was to ask and ask you two in private. He must have heard that it's rude to spring it on the bride and groom.\n\nBut apparently, he can't distinguish between asking and demanding. It's still 'demanding' if he asks and then cusses you out for saying 'no'. (BTW, I don't see anything weird about any couple - gay or straight - being inspired by the romance of a wedding or it's beautiful setting. But plenty of people reasonably conclude that they want THEIR wedding to be about that and not also about someone else's relationship.)\n\nI don't think you need to keep trying to explain. There is certainly nothing you've said or done that requires an apology. The most I'd say to him now is, \"*I get that you are disappointed and hurt. What you are asking is more than fiance and I want to sacrifice. I am disappointed and hurt that you would insult me and bail on my wedding because I don't want to share my wedding celebration with you and your gf. I hope you come to the wedding, and we take time in the weeks either before or after to talk things through and heal our friendship. But know that the answer will not be changing.*\"", "Because lots of people really, really hate having someone else mad at them. You can see it in this story, even-OP is completely in the right, but he's still trying to reach out and make amends. A lot of the time, anger is a strategy that someone uses, probably unconsciously, to put pressure on someone else until they get what they want.", "Nice P&P reference", "It\u2019s a straight man thing. Look at all the texts that get posted of men being totally flirty with women & when a woman politely declines his advances he immediately flips out. Calls her names & shit totally confirming she did the right thing. That\u2019s a real thing. Many times I have been called horrific things in public when I\u2019ve simple said no thank you to a drink offer. \n\nThese men are do used to getting what they want, a no sends them into a rage & they can\u2019t perceive that they are wrong. They only see how they are a victim for others not giving him what he wants.", "\"Why can't I pop the question on your special day. All the food and beautiful scenery are already there!\" \n\nSeriously. People just want to piggyback ride for free so they don't have to pay for all of this stuff themselves. \n\nSaw one who answered a hysterical friend in the most brilliant way when he was screaming, \"But it would be a beautiful proposal.\" \n\nShe simply gathered all receipts for him. \nAnd started laying them down. \"This is the cost of the venue you want to propose at. I expect half of the price from you\" then what food and drinks would be \"oh and since you will have a included engagement dinner. Half of this price, too, \" continued with \"we have a dj as well. Flowers.... so half of that, too.\" \nSimple put. He could pay half of the wedding price. Then he could propose. The man backtracked so fast.", "Because most are fake. Someone tells another person they\u2019re close to a perfectly reasonable thing and they start yelling at them, calling them an AH, calling them selfish and making threatening ultimatums. They then tell all their mutual friends and family and the OP\u2019s phone is blowing up with people saying they\u2019re an AH.", "Proposing at a wedding is an all around bad idea. It\u2019s an attempt to take the spotlight away from the people who are getting married, it\u2019s jarring for the guests given the sudden shift in tone and attention, it\u2019s exploiting that fact that others\u2019 have spent a significant quantity of money for one specific purpose and turning it into something about yourself because you\u2019re too cheap to do your own thing, and it\u2019s extremely manipulative to propose to someone in such a fancy place and atmosphere with so many people who care about both you and the person who you are proposing to, as you\u2019re presenting an extremely positive outcome if they say yes, but also presenting an extremely negative outcome in front of their friends and family if they say no or even hesitate slightly. If they say yes, at least the mood is kept happy, but if they say no, they are in a position where they\u2019ll blame themselves for ruining someone else\u2019s wedding, and rejecting someone in public in front of people they know and care about.\n\nIf someone is the type of person who wants to go ahead with it either despite the above or because of it, how else do you expect them to respond to someone telling them not to do that?\n\nOP is NTA, but should re-evaluate their friendship.

Too bizarre to even take seriously.", "At best the optics would be shitty--a straight couple literally  interrupting the ceremony of a gay couple to propose and highlight their relationship instead. \n\nThis does feel targeted, even if unintentionally. In the US, gay marriage was only legalized nationwide in 2015. And after the overturn of Roe v. Wade, it's possible Obergefell v. Hodges could be as well. The personal is political and \"best friend's\" tantrum at being told no is telling. I highly doubt he would've dared ask this of a straight couple. He clearly doesn't respect OP's relationship if he's dead set on interrupting the ceremony. I don't think OP has different rules for straight couples but is highlighting his fianc\u00e9's reasonable discomfort with the situation.", "[removed]", "That's how it needs to be, anything more pressurized than that is going to create a risk of marital regret.", "[removed]", "It sounds like your doggo was a fun, welcome, and brief addition to wedding festivities!
