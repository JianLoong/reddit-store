He's been in very poor health but took a turn for the worse in September and hasn't really recovered since. Then we are just going back to my mums and having a Chinese takeaway for dinner. My mum recently had a hip replacement operation and we had a family celebration last weekend so a quiet day suits us both. This is also the first year in 14 years that I haven't been working through Christmas. \n\nSo I decided to go and see my dad tonight (Xmas eve) because I won't see him tomorrow. When I got there my stepmum gave me a present early so I could try it on incase she had to exchange it. Its a lovely green dress, more of a casual wear thing than a going out all glammed up but it looks lovely, fits me well and it's comfy so I'm happy with it. Now we come to the issue, my stepmum started to insist I had to wear this dress on Christmas Day. She demanded I get up, do my hair and makeup and get \"glammed up\" for the day. She also wants me to take pictures as proof that I've \"made an effort for once\". I am not a girly girl, I'm overweight, I hate wearing makeup unless I'm going out somewhere special. I very rarely wear dresses, I much prefer jeans and a nice top. But the more alcohol my stepmum consumed tonight, the more of a tongue lashing I was getting. Apparently I'm wallowing in self pity, I either need to do something about my weight or just be \"fat and happy\" but this means putting a full face of makeup on and doing my hair each day. I tried to tell her I'd rather wear what I feel comfortable in and that I don't need to wear makeup to feel good about myself. I have postive and negative days like everyone else. \n\nI told her I'd keep the dress for Hogmanay since I'm staying with them and we are having people round to bring in the bells but I didn't appreciate her trying to dictate how I should be living my life. She got upset and told me I'm being ungrateful and she's only trying to help me. I do feel like I was a bit snappy with her but I'm fed up with being made to feel like I'm not good enough just because I'm overweight so AITA for refusing to wear the dress she bought me?", "created_utc": 1671929390, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zun08f/aita_for_refusing_to_wear_a_dress_my_stepmum_got/", "score": 413, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe stay at a hotel instead of staying with them", "NTA. What you wear is your business. Certainly not your tipsy stepmother's.", "Nta. She's  obnoxious when drunk, though she obviously cares enough to find something that fits, and is useful....I have been given some dreadful tat over the years, so am quite envious there. Ignore her rant and wear it when you want.", "NTA. You're an adult. If you don't want to wear makeup or dresses then you don't have to. Nor is it stepmoms business what you weigh or how you style your hair. While she may think she's being \"helpful,\" pressure and aggression is not something most people appreciate being the recipient of. You could give her tips on what you think would be a more flattering hairstyle and more suitable clothing, or ways to improve her cooking...\n\n*eta.

Enjoy your Christmas and hope your granddad keeps hanging on.", "NTA it's a massive overreach for her to buy clothing for you as an adult, demand that you wear it, and also in general shame your appearance.\n\nYou're right not to appreciate her trying to control you and disrespecting you. There's nothing to be grateful for, and she isn't helping you. One precludes that she's giving you a gift by being disrespectful to you, the other that she's actually there to help you in some way", "NTA.\n\nFeel free to post in r/maliciouscompliance afterward if you choose to wear the dress with a full face of makeup \u2014 your choice: special effects makeup, theatrical makeup, or Halloween makeup.", "NTA. Your stepmom is the AH for insisting you wear the dress and glam up.", "If I wasn't going up to the nursing home I'd probably just stay in my onesie all day aswell.

Do that when your father isn't around like she did to you with that dress.", "Urgh I hate people who pull that shit.  Try to avoid being alone with her.  I know it's not always easy but if your dad pops out maybe you can go to your bedroom or if that doesn't work, suddenly have some serious gastric distress and need to be in the bathroom for, coincidentally, however long he's out.", "I\u2019m surprised no one has mentioned the fat phobia going on here. Thin women get away with no makeup and jeans and a hoodie, with their hair up, and can be praised for looking cute/attractive. But when we\u2019re overweight, we\u2019re expected to be performatively feminine in order to be thought of as cute/attractive or be accepted out in society. It\u2019s an extra burden, especially for those of us who don\u2019t like makeup and hair styling and don\u2019t want to take the time every day. But because we\u2019re overweight, we\u2019re supposed to put in the extra effort. Such bull. \n\nCongrats on your healthy boundaries and self esteem!\n\nNTA.", "NTA and your stepmom is a nasty bully", "NTA, but stepmom definitely seems to be. Also, if she's ruined the gift with her comments, I'd tell her to exchange it for store credit so you don't have to associate the \"gift\" with her behavior.\n\nIf she hasn't, wear it when you feel the occasion fits Hogsmanay or otherwise.\n\nI would recommend talking to her about her passive aggressive gift-giving and abusive commentary when she's sober. A gift given with good intentions should be based on what the recipient wants; her gift was given with ulterior motives utterly based on what she wants...which seems to have been a way to appear gracious while getting some digs about your appearance and temperament in.\n\nEnjoy your holiday with your mom and grandpa today\u2014I hope the three of you have a Happy Christmas \ud83c\udf84", "NTA- and I'd put money that she would use those pictures to harass you into dressing up till the end of time itself", "Fyi it's called boxing day because the rich used to box up their Xmas leftovers and give them to the poor.", "Yes!

I would be tempted to put on the dress and do Mimi (from the Drew Carey show) makeup! Maybe, her hair, too and send her pictures of that, then; change into whatever the hell you please! \n\nNTA She needs to butt out!", "Nta", "NTA. WTF is wrong with her. \n\nPersonally I\u2019d never wear it ever.

NTA!", "NTA\n\nPersonally, i would've given the dress back. When there are conditions tied to a gift, it is no longer a gift but an obligation, a contract.\n\nIt is clear that this was a backhanded gift from stepmum and her true intention all along. This wasn't a gift for you, this was a gift for her.

You're an adult, you can dress yourself. You also have your own life, you don't need her \"help.\"", "NTA \n\nYou are an adult and not her dress up doll.", "NTA - definitely. To avoid the discussion/argument, you can say/do if you want to that is:  When she's drunk, lie, tell her that you will, then day of do what you want. If mentioned, you can say you spilled something on it during breakfast and couldn't wear it till it was cleaned.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nBut your stepmother has made it clear how she feels about you and your weight. A lot to unpack there.", "NTA\n\nI'd have handed the dress back and refused it on the grounds that it came with the condition that stepmom could be bossy about when and how I wore it. No thanks. Don't need that bullshit.", "Heck. Yes. I\u2019m very lucky that I\u2019ve landed in some kind of beautiful bubble where none of the people who are actually in my life ever try to shame me about being fat (seriously, it\u2019s great and I wish I could include all my fellow awesome fat people in this bubble), so I only generally get comments from strangers, which is annoying but far less painful.
