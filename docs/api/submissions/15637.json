After I get home, sometimes I just want to watch a show or movie of choice to unwind. My husband (30m) is one of those guys who always has control of the tv, has it running all day, always turns it on once he gets up or gets home; it doesn\u2019t matter where we are (home, hotel, FIL\u2019s, he\u2019s even been known to stream sports while at stores and in the car). \n\nThis constant consumption of TV has been grating on me because we have one TV (in the living room; I don\u2019t want one I\u2019m the bedroom bc it makes it hard to sleep -see above and guess as to why-). Hubby has asked why is it that if I watch a show, I watch it on my iPad in the bedroom. We had a convo the other night about how his interests/content feel more important than mine because they always are on and I don\u2019t feel like I get space to sit and watch a show. \n\nLast night I snapped at him. I get home, turn on a movie on my iPad and put in my earbuds since he already had the tv on with what he wanted to watch. He insisted that I watch my movie on the tv instead of the iPad in the other room (in an attempt to respect my concern -above-). He said he was watching an event for work so I offered to leave the TV to him so he can watch his work thing, he insisted otherwise. So I took him at his word and put my movie on. He then puts on one game on his computer and another one on his phone, while I\u2019m trying to watch the movie. (This is in the same room as the tv and he was 3 feet away from me). I went to the bedroom after my movie was done pissed off. When he checked in with me what was wrong, I snapped at him bc why should I have bothered watching a movie if he was going to proceed to put on 2 screens 3 feet away. He said he was trying to be respectful of me wanting space to watch a show but it feels really disrespectful because he regained that space immediately. AITA for snapping at him?\n\nEdit for clarity: we had a conversation the night before last about how he takes over the TV and most of the content in the house (including sharing social media) and how I feel like I don\u2019t have any space for what I want to consume and it\u2019s frustrating that I don\u2019t get that space to decompress and unwind unless I go to a space alone. That his stuff takes precedence over mine. So this situation, frustration and my pissed off response was 24 hours after that initial conversation.", "created_utc": 1682419830, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12yfqsk/aita_for_wanting_uninterrupted_tv_time_and_then/", "score": 108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He has upset you and needs to apologize for making you feel the way you did. I think you both need to have a sit down to clear the air over this.

OP is frustrated because she doesn\u2019t have \u201cany space\u201d to watch what she wants because \u201che takes over the TV\u201d. I think husband was just trying to help OP feel better about sharing the space & TV. His help wasn\u2019t very helpful. \n\nIf his job includes watching sports all day then the solution is to find a space for husband to do his job. They shouldn\u2019t be sharing a space if OP is watching a movie & husband is trying to work. No one would watch a movie in anyone\u2019s office while they were working.", "Camel straw back. And dial back the drama\u2014she snapped at him and stomped off, not raged.\n\nTurns out he was doing both without headphones on.", "Right. But he gave up the tv for you here and then he proceeded to, annoyingly, use two devices near you where you could hear them. \n\nWhy didnt you ask him to get head phones or say the cacophony of noise was distracting?", "Bring back the second tv, you must both agree only you get to use it so it doesn't disturb your sleep since he's inconsiderate. Unless you're saying he's selfish enough to not agree to that condition?", "Alright, in that case NTA, sorry it ended up in a argument. I hope this makes your communication with one another better, and best of luck <3", "Then *say something* when the movie is on - she just sat there for 90+ minutes in silence annoyed?", "Well the title does say \u201cuninterrupted TV time\u201d so kind of analogous to not getting enough tv time. \n\nBut if she was pissed she needed to say something and not storm off like a child.", "\u201cI cant hear the movie, can you get headphones\u201d", "Why didn't he just think to wear headphones himself? It's pretty common sense that if you're on a secondary screen to use headphones. And I think that's the bigger root than this one issue. The husband has a pattern of casual inconsiderate behavior and even when he's deliberately given the answer of how to be better, he still doesn't stick the landing.", "He proceeded to, *passive-aggressively*, use two deviced near OP where she could hear them.  He was being an asshole on purpose.", "He got passive-aggressive when she told him she likes to watch shows of her own, so I wouldn't expect him to respect OP's need for sleep any more than he did when they had the TV in there before.", "Maybe because after a long day, she just wants to relax and it can be exhausting to have to continually fight against this type of encroachment ALL THE TIME. Like they just talked about this at length, she clearly didn\u2019t want to deal with it again since she just put in headphones to watch her movie. But he kept insisting she put the movie on the TV. Clearly he\u2019s not respecting her very simple ask here, so I get why it just didn\u2019t feel worth the effort until he JUST KEPT PUSHING. Like don\u2019t act concerned if you\u2019re not going to change the behavior. He saw she was using headphones to not have so much noise, so clearly he could put two and two together and do the same.", "Why do women always have to explain the most self explanatory stuff to grown ass adult men?", "She's a human, who was angry about not being listened to. It happens.", "Camel straw back", "> Why didn't he just think to wear headphones himself?\n\nBecause that would have defeated his purpose.  It was his intention to annoy OP.", "Exactly, it's just infuriating to have to deal with \"loophole abuse\" -- well TEKNICALLY you didn't tell me not to turn on my two screens so how was I supposed to KNOW? is some BS on the husband's part.", "You mean why does one have to communicate to their partner when they are upset? \n\nBecause that\u2019s how effective communication in relationships works.", "And what do we do when that happens\u2026 \n\nWe use our words. We communicate.", "Didn't answer my question.", "If we are perfect flawless robots who never show human emotions in our relationships, OK then."]}
