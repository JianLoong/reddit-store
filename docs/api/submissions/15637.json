After I get home, sometimes I just want to watch a show or movie of choice to unwind. My husband (30m) is one of those guys who always has control of the tv, has it running all day, always turns it on once he gets up or gets home; it doesn\u2019t matter where we are (home, hotel, FIL\u2019s, he\u2019s even been known to stream sports while at stores and in the car). \n\nThis constant consumption of TV has been grating on me because we have one TV (in the living room; I don\u2019t want one I\u2019m the bedroom bc it makes it hard to sleep -see above and guess as to why-). Hubby has asked why is it that if I watch a show, I watch it on my iPad in the bedroom. We had a convo the other night about how his interests/content feel more important than mine because they always are on and I don\u2019t feel like I get space to sit and watch a show. \n\nLast night I snapped at him. I get home, turn on a movie on my iPad and put in my earbuds since he already had the tv on with what he wanted to watch. He insisted that I watch my movie on the tv instead of the iPad in the other room (in an attempt to respect my concern -above-). He said he was watching an event for work so I offered to leave the TV to him so he can watch his work thing, he insisted otherwise. So I took him at his word and put my movie on. He then puts on one game on his computer and another one on his phone, while I\u2019m trying to watch the movie. (This is in the same room as the tv and he was 3 feet away from me). I went to the bedroom after my movie was done pissed off. When he checked in with me what was wrong, I snapped at him bc why should I have bothered watching a movie if he was going to proceed to put on 2 screens 3 feet away. He said he was trying to be respectful of me wanting space to watch a show but it feels really disrespectful because he regained that space immediately. AITA for snapping at him?\n\nEdit for clarity: we had a conversation the night before last about how he takes over the TV and most of the content in the house (including sharing social media) and how I feel like I don\u2019t have any space for what I want to consume and it\u2019s frustrating that I don\u2019t get that space to decompress and unwind unless I go to a space alone. That his stuff takes precedence over mine. So this situation, frustration and my pissed off response was 24 hours after that initial conversation.", "created_utc": 1682419830, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12yfqsk/aita_for_wanting_uninterrupted_tv_time_and_then/", "score": 2758, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He has upset you and needs to apologize for making you feel the way you did. I think you both need to have a sit down to clear the air over this.

But you may be right that they have just such different understandings that he didn\u2019t hear it that way and really thought his solution was a compromise. In that case I would vote N A H I guess. \n\nBut maybe a good idea to just check in on their needs/preferences so you guys can avoid getting to resentment phase, just in case!", "What the other person said! And in my case, my ex was a narcissist who saw me as an extension of himself and needed me to like everything he liked. I would tell him I didn\u2019t particularly like a show or band or whatever, and he would literally say \u201cyes you do. I like it so you do too.\u201d", "Thank you for being so nice about this. All the comments about him being inconsiderate or that he is acting entitled/like a dick (while relating to him) sent my good ol anxiety into hyperdrive.\n\n\nI get the noise being distracting thing now. It didnt really click that she was asking for an experience, and that experience could be ruined by distractions.\n\n\nTime to go show this post to my SO and ask a million questions about what they need space wise in case I've been missing some serious flags!", "Hey, I updated your comment, but I had to reread it twice because you used \"connoted\". It's the incorrect word, I'm sorry to say.", "Maybe you should learn to *read* before commenting.\n\n> it will not hold the same weight as misogyny because women are not in power, men are\n\nLMAO, let me guess, you also think racism by minorities is not racism because they are not in power.\n\nThis stuff is not \"sociology 101\", it's complete garbage that any semi-educated adult laughs at.\n\nPS: You're probably also one of these geniuses who applies their American centric view everywhere and completely misses the irony.", "NTA. Are we married to the same guy? Also smart move on not having the TV in the bedroom, never compromise on that shit. The nunber of fucking times I go to bed only for my husband to decide then is the perfect time to watch TV in bed and \"spend time with me\" after ignoring me and everything else in the house for the entire day.", "NTA. This is the saddest home life I\u2019ve ever heard of.", "I have wondered if men really walk around in the world without a thought that anything they do might be annoying to others.  My husband is really a lovely human being, but if I'm watching a TV show, he will start up a YouTube video with the volume up so he can hear it, and then be surprised when I mention it. (Not upset, just surprised, as if he had no idea there were competing soundtracks.) I don't get being totally oblivious unless you truly feel deep in your bones that you have the right.  Not being arrogant or deliberately being an ass. Maybe it's a deep inner feeling of superiority. Is it one of the ways boys and girls are raised differently, with different expectations?  I'm not talking about being greedy or taking advantage of someone on purpose. Just casually assuming that space, or time or objects are for you to take over anyone else who is around.  I have tried to imagine being that way, and I just can't fathom something like moving my husband's cooking prep because I suddenly want popcorn or something.  (He hasn't done that - just an example!)  Or going into the break room at work, grabbing 2 donuts and walking off.  I'd be asking if everyone had gotten a donut, were there people who didn't know the donuts were here, did anyone want the last chocolate covered, etc.  Just something I ponder", "NTA He is trying to control you. Get your own social media accounts and tell him want space, at least 2 hours a day when he doesn't bother you.", "Girl did you marry Mike Teavee? NTA but I think your husband has an addiction to television/streaming if he needs screens blasting 24/7. Jeez.", "NTA you should just stick to your ear buds and iPad. A compromise would be to have 2 TVs so you can each watch what you want. But you vetoed that idea. I\u2019m sure he would keep you up with it if you had one in the bedroom. He doesn\u2019t seem to think of others. He should have given you your tv time alone and gone to the bedroom since he doesn\u2019t have the ability to be thoughtful of others even in the smallest ways.", "Nta at all", "NTA and him thinking that him and his needs always take precedence is very concerning. Also him not realizing that watching something else three feet away wouldn't be disruptive is\u2026jaw dropping. You deserve better.\n\nAs a suggestion, maybe you need a \"woman cave\" (ew that expression sorry), with your own tv and it's your room to unwind and relax without the sound of his sports.", "Soft YTA for you....\n\nI feel you have made some choices that have caused your issues & I think you've been mildly deceptive:\n\n*1) You complained about him watching sports all the time but conveniently left out that he is a sports journalist. What is he supposed to do? NOT watch the games he's paid to write / talk about?*\n\n*2) You claim that you don't want the TV in the bedroom because it's hard to sleep, but is that really the reason you don't want a TV in there? With 2 TV's, 2 adults, and no kids or roommates it's not like he has to have the TV on in the bedroom when you are trying to get some rest. It sounds to me like you may prefer no TV in the bedroom as a design choice.*\n\nAssuming you didn't intentionally mislead; with the first complaint being about sports always being on it sounds like your real issue is what is on, rather than that it's on. In addition, when you get home after a long day's work rather than curling up with your boo to watch a movie, you have to compete with sports for his attention. I get that sucks, but it's his job and likely his passion. \n\nHeadsets may be a partial solve, but long term if enjoying his presence is what you're really missing then something else about the situation will begin to bother you once the sound problem is resolved. It'll be the light from the T.V., him taking up space on the couch, or the pecking of the keyboard while he types up his next article.\n\nI feel YTA because you knew what he did for a living and you have created an environment where it's hard for him to do his job without getting on your nerves, yet were still annoyed and complained when he tried to compromise and find a solution... that said I feel for the situation because it sounds like your lifestyle and needs may not be compatible with his career... That's a hard relationship problem to solve.", "NTA", "NTA This legit sounds like my dad and it\u2019s crazy how annoying it can get at times. My mom usually gets pretty mad about it", "ESH - why did it take you until the end of the movie to say something?  It seems like he is being selfish, but you aren\u2019t communicating until you are at the point of being very angry.", "My mother was the TV person when I was growing up; she'd doze off in front of it every night then immediately snap to as soon as someone tried to turn it off or change it. By the time I was a teenager my dad had wholly given up and would just sit at the kitchen table and read instead. Once I moved out though I've found that it's always guys who will do it. I've had men blithely take the remote out of my hands as if it got there by mistake. The only saving grace in my current situation is my SO goes to bed early and I'm a night owl, so I get a few hours of peace and TV after he goes to bed.", "I require 30.

I was pointing it out to the person who responded to you, as it can be very hard to determine.", "I suppose I want the second trial to dare him to put his inconsideration and disrespect in black and white for both of them to see. \n\nThe first time around, he could claim he didn't know, he wasn't told, he didn't mean it, etc. \n\nIf the second attempt has very clear conditions from the start and have been told the clear reasons as to *why* those conditions are needed, AND he still violates the agreement, then it speaks greater volumes about a problem beyond tv and OP's decompression time.", "NTA. Does your husband have other addictions, or just this one?", "so because he\u2019s a sports journalist means he can\u2019t use headphones and that he doesn\u2019t have to be respectful of others in the space? just because it\u2019s for his job doesn\u2019t give him a right to disrupt someone else when there are easy solutions", "It's overstimulation", "sometimes just the closing of a cabinet door seems like someone slamming a mallet into a bass drum to me depending on the state i\u2019m in. is it rational to yell at someone for closing a door inconsiderately? no. but if someone tells you what sets this off more than once while they\u2019re calm, the snapping point is usually not just about the noise but also by the feeling of not being listened to or considered. if it happens repeatedly it\u2019s the same as turning up the volume dial gradually and if someone is putting headphones on and heading to their own space the last thing you should do is follow them into it with the things YOU KNOW they\u2019re trying to escape", "Wow, at least in this particular circumstance it sounds like he doesn\u2019t respect you at all.", "Ha ha if you get earbuds from two different sets you can listen to two different things on two different devices at the same time!
