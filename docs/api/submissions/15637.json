After I get home, sometimes I just want to watch a show or movie of choice to unwind. My husband (30m) is one of those guys who always has control of the tv, has it running all day, always turns it on once he gets up or gets home; it doesn\u2019t matter where we are (home, hotel, FIL\u2019s, he\u2019s even been known to stream sports while at stores and in the car). \n\nThis constant consumption of TV has been grating on me because we have one TV (in the living room; I don\u2019t want one I\u2019m the bedroom bc it makes it hard to sleep -see above and guess as to why-). Hubby has asked why is it that if I watch a show, I watch it on my iPad in the bedroom. We had a convo the other night about how his interests/content feel more important than mine because they always are on and I don\u2019t feel like I get space to sit and watch a show. \n\nLast night I snapped at him. I get home, turn on a movie on my iPad and put in my earbuds since he already had the tv on with what he wanted to watch. He insisted that I watch my movie on the tv instead of the iPad in the other room (in an attempt to respect my concern -above-). He said he was watching an event for work so I offered to leave the TV to him so he can watch his work thing, he insisted otherwise. So I took him at his word and put my movie on. He then puts on one game on his computer and another one on his phone, while I\u2019m trying to watch the movie. (This is in the same room as the tv and he was 3 feet away from me). I went to the bedroom after my movie was done pissed off. When he checked in with me what was wrong, I snapped at him bc why should I have bothered watching a movie if he was going to proceed to put on 2 screens 3 feet away. He said he was trying to be respectful of me wanting space to watch a show but it feels really disrespectful because he regained that space immediately. AITA for snapping at him?\n\nEdit for clarity: we had a conversation the night before last about how he takes over the TV and most of the content in the house (including sharing social media) and how I feel like I don\u2019t have any space for what I want to consume and it\u2019s frustrating that I don\u2019t get that space to decompress and unwind unless I go to a space alone. That his stuff takes precedence over mine. So this situation, frustration and my pissed off response was 24 hours after that initial conversation.", "created_utc": 1682419830, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12yfqsk/aita_for_wanting_uninterrupted_tv_time_and_then/", "score": 633, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He has upset you and needs to apologize for making you feel the way you did. I think you both need to have a sit down to clear the air over this.

Christ on a cracker.", "my dad only cared about sunday football the rest of the time he was fine watching whatever we waned my grandpa however was like the guys in your family didnt matter what you were watching asked for the remote and changed it to what he wants this is b4 mobile devices were a thing. my brother hated this as much as i did and he lets his kids control it and just watches with them or his show on his tablet", "Wow, I'm sad for your family! Why don't the men respect the women as equals? Why are their wants more important? I would be furious, just like the other women in my family/friend circle. And confront them.", "They have a communication issue for sure.", "She said \u201di need space to watch\u201d\nshe also took the ipad and sat in a diff room watching it.\nWhat MORE could she have done?\nHe went \u201dnah Id like you to sit in the livingroom like u wanted \u201dignoring  90% of what she said\u2026\nand somehow this is still a mutual issue in your eyes?", "Oh come on.  It's *rude* to sit next to someone who is watching a show and produce noise.  Let's not pretend he doesn't know this.  She needs to explain to him not to be rude to her?", "Yes, she should have begged him not to be rude to her by sitting next to her making noise while she's watching a show.  That's *her* responsibility, because this grown ass man can't possibly be expected to use basic manners toward his own spouse without being told. \n\nThere's a very high chance if she had said something to him, or had just left to watch in the bedroom as usual, he would have blown up and she wouldn't have been able to watch the show at all.", "Everyone knows it's rude to sit next to someone who's watching a show and produce noise.  He was doing it on purpose to annoy her.", "Yes, she has to explain to him that it's rude to sit next to her and make noise while she's watching a show, because this grown ass man couldn't *possibly* be expected to understand that without being told.", "Since he was obviously doing it on purpose to annoy her, what would have been the purpose?  He would most likely have argued and her show would have been completely ruined.  \n\nProducing noise next to someone who is watching a show is *always* rude, and let's not pretend this grown ass man doesn't know that.  He was being a passive-aggressive asshole.", "I think he had bad intentions, because she told him what she wanted, and then he did the exact opposite.  Besides, it's *always* rude to produce noise next to someone who is watching a show.  OP is right to be angry at this level of rudeness and disrespect.", "I didn't catch that vibe at all that OP is acting like the sport tv show is a hobby, she literally offered the TV for him and to leave the room as she knew it was important for him to watch this event.", "This is the paragraph where I think she buried context and it\u2019s quite important context as to what he does and seems a bit condescending about what he does as to why he would be doing this. I agree a better conversation needs to be had though for boundaries or this will never work. He\u2019s even known to stream sports in the car?!\n\n\u201cMy husband (30m) is one of those guys who always has control of the tv, has it running all day, always turns it on once he gets up or gets home; it doesn\u2019t matter where we are (home, hotel, FIL\u2019s, he\u2019s even been known to stream sports while at stores and in the car). \u201c", "Idk sounds like she laid it out very well and he just didn't listen.", "Now who's engaging in harmful stereotyping? (You. The answer is you.)", "\"real men\" gets me every time. These are \"real men\" behaving this way. But of course, anyone who thinks otherwise must be a basement dweller...", "It is a mutual issue because they are a couple and share a home together.  \nWhat would your suggestion be ?", "I am not saying that what he does is ok, just saying that they need to agree to   \n some soft of a compromise to settle the issue.", "I don\u2019t understand why you complied against your will? Is he impossible to say No to? If so, you\u2019ve got much bigger problems.", "How to be a professional on being mad, just don't say what is in your mind. \"Hey, put some headphones on, I can't listen to the tv\". \n\nBut nah, that would solve the problem.\n\nNice assumption that he would blow up if she told him to put some headphones on, out of nowhere, but nice assumption.", "And he was more interested in being an asshole to her, by insisting she watch the show on the TV and then sitting right next to her and producing noise.  Let's not pretend he had no idea he was being obnoxious.  He was being passive-aggressive and *trying* to ruin her show.", "He doesn't want to compromise, or he wouldn't be so passive-aggressive toward her.  Insisting she watch the TV when she was willing to watch her device in the bedroom, and then sitting next to her producing noise is asshole behavior.", "All I'm hearing with this is \"I know he's doing wrong, but OP needs to try harder\". OP has already tried compromising. Husband didn't want that. It's on him to do the work now.", "Uninterrupted TV time means uninterrupted TV time.  He interrupted her TV time after she asked him not to, because he's a passive-aggressive asshole.", "I don't think that he was. He seems to be perfectly happy watching his sports shows while tuning out OP's show. So it would make sense if he thinks other people like OP can operate that way too. \n\nThat is a big part of why he's not seeing what the issue is, he's thinking the problem can be solved by simply physically sharing the space, when what OP needs is actually for him to make less noise while she wants to use the space. She doesn't consider it usable space unless it's quiet, and he obviously doesn't get that at all. \n\nAn indicator of this is him watching 2 things on 2 screens at once himself, and being perfectly happy about it. That would probably drive OP crazy, and she would not consider that her idea of fun.", "So, how do you suggest she address the issue ?", "Give me an example of a sentence OP should say to her SO. How in your eyes is appropriate for OP to address the issue? What would you say if you were in her shoes ?", "Either that or he is alarmingly clueless.", "By watching her shows on her device in the bedroom with headphones.", "\"I'm going to watch my show in the bedroom.\"", "I know that and you know that. But I don't think the person I was replying to knows that."]}
