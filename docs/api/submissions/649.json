Ever since the wedding, my dad\u2019s family has been asking her for plenty of things, and she was always happy to help, never asking for anything back. \n\nNow, a few weeks ago, I was on FaceTime with my dad (I moved abroad for college), and he told me that his wife had received a random text from my aunt, asking her for money, 2500-3000\u20ac, for my cousins\u2019 schools and some bills. We were all stunned about it, since we hadn\u2019t spoken to her in about three years prior to that, but we eventually let it go and moved on.\n\nA few days later, I got a notification on Messenger. What I saw was a whole message from my aunt asking me about college and how I like it in my new country, followed by a request of 200-300\u20ac for my cousins and some bills.\n\nI ignored the text and moved on with my day. Later, she texted me on WhatsApp, asking how was college and telling me that she hoped I liked it. I ignored her again. She then proceeded to follow me on Instagram and text me there as well. Lastly, she called me on messenger and gave up.\n\nWhen on FaceTime with my dad, I sarcastically told him the story since I really found the whole thing funny. My dad got very pissed of about it, especially since I am a student in a foreign country and I really don\u2019t have the money for these kind of things.
