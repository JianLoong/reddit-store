I was heading out with my dog so I needed to take the elevator down. My dog is 8 years old and she is a very well behaved girl. She doesn\u2019t bark at anyone, she has a calm demenour and will only approach strangers in public when they indicate for her to come to them. She\u2019s a medium size dog and I can\u2019t imagine anyone thinking she\u2019s scary looking. She is always on leash when we\u2019re outside the house (unless we\u2019re at a designated area for dogs to be off leash) \n\nWe were waiting for the elevator and when it opened there were two people inside: 15-20F and 20-25F.

I\u2019m very scared of dogs!\u201d I tell the passengers \u201cthe elevator is for everyone, including dogs\u201d and we both enter. As a courtesy I keep my dog on a very short leash and keep her behind my legs at the opposite end of the elevator. The passenger is yelling \u201cget out\u201d and has pushed up to the back of the elevator. I reply saying \u201cif you don\u2019t want to be in the elevator with a dog you can take the next one.\u201d She declines to leave the elevator and we have an altogether uneventful 20 second journey to the ground floor. At no point did she say she\u2019s allergic to dogs, and had that been the case I would not have taken the same elevator. When we exited she made several comments and AH was one of the nicer ones. I ignored her and walked to the car.\n\nWas I under any obligation to take another elevator? I agree if there\u2019s an allergy or something of that sort then obviously take the next elevator, but this wasn\u2019t the case. It seems pretty discriminatory on her part to react the way she did. Maybe she has had a bad experience with a dog in the past but that has nothing to do with my dog. From my perspective if she reacted like that to me because of how I look, that would be racism (I\u2019m brown). I consider my dog to be family, so why would I put up with discrimination against my dog? AITA? Should I take the next elevator the next time?\n\nEdit:\n\nI appreciate the feedback, even the YTA replies. I posted this specifically to learn, grow and be better the next time. I\u2019ll take the YTA on this, it wouldn\u2019t have cost me anything to wait for the next one and I\u2019ll do that the next time. \n\nSome additional info:\n\nMy dog was behind my legs pressed up against the elevator wall. The other passenger could have easily exited if they wished. I\u2019m not saying she should have exited, I understand my error.

She was pretty clear by saying \" No, No, NO! I\u2019m very scared of dogs!\u201d And you forced her into that situation anyway. She could have always gotten off the elevator, sure, but she was there first.\n\nA fear of dogs isn't all that rare or bizarre. Do you not have any fears of your own that you wouldn't like forced on you in the confines of an elevator? Spiders? Roaches? Snakes? How would you feel if you were terrified of rats and some guy walked in with his pet rat on his shoulder and asked you to hold it?", "YTA.  Phobias are a very real medical condition, no less real and no less serious than allergies.  There's no reason you couldn't have taken another elevator.  Were you obligated to do so?  No.  Was refusing to do so an asshole move?  Yep, it was.\n\nYou could have chosen kindness toward someone who was clearly absolutely petrified and was in the elevator first.  You didn't.\n\nETA:  And no, phobia of dogs is not discrimination, for heaven's sake.  It's a phobia.  It's an illness.  Your dog is a member of *your* family.  To her it's a source of terror and a threat, and honestly, the degree to which you're dismissing her phobia as ridiculous and overwrought is also an AH move.  It's not equivalent to racism.  Good God.  \n\nI also just looked closer and based on your estimate, the girl you went ahead and terrified may have been a literal child.  Extra YTA.", "YTA, you actively went out of your way to escalate that whole situation. If anybody's first impulse is to say 'fuck it' and continue doing what is clearly putting someone into an uncomfortable situation, they are clearly an asshole.", "YTA. Are you incapable of empathy or like basic decency? Another person is literally shouting that she's afraid of dogs and your reaction is just mean and cruel. Bit of a stretch with that discriminating your dog bit.", "YTA. You could tell the woman was extremely upset and uncomfortable. She was on the elevator first, so it\u2019s only common courtesy to wait for the next one rather than make her exit and get another elevator down herself. Some people have a legitimate phobia of dogs and YTA for not showing consideration for the woman and her obvious fear. You even acknowledged that she may have had a traumatic experience with a dog, but then say that it wasn\u2019t your dog so it\u2019s not your problem. Well guess what, that\u2019s not how phobias work, and that\u2019s a shitty way of thinking. You really took it ridiculously far by saying that she was discriminating against your dog???? Are you for real? Get a grip and some manners and wait for the next elevator.", "YTA\n\nI wish there were a rating beyond asshole. You tortured someone on purpose.", "YTA. Bro, she was already in the elevator and you trapped her when you entered and made her sit in a tiny space with her phobia. What was she supposed to do? Walk towards your dog to leave? You\u2019re not so important you can\u2019t just wait. That\u2019s wild. I would never think to enter any elevator after someone already inside has a reaction like that to my being there. When people have strong reactions to you/your dog/whatever\u2026 you back away not charge forward. Holy smokes.\n\nEdit: spelling", "YTA, you are right in that it was an easy and simple matter to change elevators\n\nSO WHY DIDN'T YOU WAIT FOR ANOTHER ELEVATOR", "YTA for assuming racism because the woman was afraid of your dog", "So you decided to purposely frighten somone. Who has a phobia.\n\n\nThat is just mean. Wow.", "YTA. No you are not under any law or obligation to be a decent human\u2026 but would it kill you to be?", "Info: So you think this woman, well girl, pretended to be scared of your dog because you\u2019re brown?\n\nWait, no I read that wrong because I didn\u2019t think any sane person would actually type that. being afraid of something, like a dog is not a form of discrimination. It\u2019s a phobia. Possibly she was attacked. It wouldn\u2019t of hurt you to take another elevator. Instead you decided to be an ass. Also, was the dog between her and the exit to the elevator (because she said she was pushed up against the back wall)?\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nScaring minors is generally regarded as an AH move, regardless of how. Dismissing someone's discomfort for your convenience shows a lack of empathy.", "YTA\n\nJesus. Just be kind and take the next elevator - it was clear that she was frightened. \n\nAlso, no one\u2019s discriminating against your dog. Your dog doesn\u2019t have protected characteristics", "YTA. The dog is part of your family, not hers. She was already in the elevator. You could have chosen to get the next elevator, but you chose to be the AH and terrify a young girl. YTA.", "YTA, I have three dogs myself. But even just under the premise the first come first serve, you should have waited for the next elevator. People can't help their phobias. And an extra 3 minutes to be a decent human being to the person inside the elevator won't ruin your day.", "YTA and a big mean jerk who would rather accuse a literal child of racism for no reason than do the bare minimum of kindness for waiting for the next lift.", "Honestly, not sure where I stand here. On the hand, it's not a stranger's job to make sure someone with a phobia isn't potentially triggered. On the other hand, it would've cost you nothing to take the next elevator knowing that person is uncomfortable around dogs, no matter how well-behaved their owner claims they are. \n\nAlso, give me a break with your last paragraph. Trying to argue that person was discriminatory for not wanting to share a space with your dog is bizarre. Additionally, trying to make a false equivalence to racism is even more bizarre.", "YTA. If this story had been \u201cthe person gave no hints that they were scared of dogs, but afterwards told me i was an AH because of their fear\u201d then, sure, you\u2019d be fine. But this person instantly flagged that there was a problem and they were scared, and continued to ask you to respect their phobia. It would be no extra effort on your part to step out of the elevator and wait for the next one and show basic empathy and compassion to a stranger who was scared.", "YTA, you have no business being a doctor if you can't take phobias seriously. Phobias are illogical fear, has nothing to do with discrimination. You're rude and an AH for calling her 20 seconds of trauma uneventful, you just seem so callous to this little girl. I hope you're not like this with your patients.", "Yta I have seen video of dogs biting people and useless owners walk way. And no one was provake these mutts.  I hate entitled dogs owners. And fear of dogs is a valid response and needs to be not seen as a mental illness. And that people pay to live in these apt. So take the damn staircase", "YTA. As a one-time thing, all you had to do was wait for the next elevator out of consideration for the panicking woman. If this were a constant thing (you kept running into the same person with this reaction), then I can see deciding that it was time for the inconvenience of having to wait for the next car be shared. \n\nI'm sure the dog didn't appreciate having to share an elevator car with a shrieking person, too.", "Yta. My husband is scared of dogs and won't go near anything bigger than a kelpie. Could be the girl has been bitten and has a deep fear of dogs. My mum has been bitten by a rough collie as a child and will literally turn around and bolt from them", "YTA\n\nHaving a phobia of dogs isn\u2019t \u201cdiscrimination\u201d.  If you\u2019re so willing to make exceptions for allergies, why not phobias?", "YTA. I have a chihuahua, a little 3 kilo scrap who never barks and avoids other people\u2014basically a dog that's even less intimidating than yours. I live in a building with two people who are terrified of her (an adult and a child). When I see either of them, I WAIT. I bring my dog to the side and block her with my body so they can pass with a wide berth. Sure, you can argue it's not rational, but since when did fears have to be rational to be respected? Maybe my own struggles with an anxiety disorder have made me more sensitive and empathetic, but I really think it's a small thing to choose kindness in this situation.\n\nMaybe you'd had a bad day, maybe you'd had your trauma from living in a racist society triggered and that's why you were in a combative headspace where you felt discriminated against. Hurt people hurt people, after all. That's an explanation but not an excuse. There are better ways to vent that off than projecting them onto your terrified neighbor who you are actively triggering.", "YTA oh noooo youre soooo discriminated against because someone is scared of dogs /s\n\nThey were already in the elevator, therefore it was your job to wait for the next one or to take the stairs. It absolutely is common curtesy that the person already in the elevator takes precedence. Doesn\u2019t matter if you think your dog isn\u2019t scary, people are terrified of dogs, like your neighbor. A bit of empathy on your end never hurts", "Yeah YTA.\n\nTo wait for the next elevator would have been a very mild inconvenience for you. The fact that you would have taken the next elevator for someone with an allergy but not for someone with a phobia is telling. The phobia isn't somehow easier for a person to deal with, it's a real thing people suffer from. Take people's mental health needs into consideration, not just their physical allergies. \n\nShe didn't discriminate against your damn dog bro, she's scared of dogs. Racist people don't have a phobia of POC, they are just assholes. Not the same thing. \n\nAll in all, YTA for discriminating people with mental health needs and invalidating them, up to insulting them and then thinking SHE is discriminating against you or your dog. Get a grip, and for fucks sake, don't force your dog upon people who are scared of dogs, especially not in a small closed space like a fucking elevator.", "YTA. ... seriously?", "If someone strolled into an elevator with their pet tarantula riding on their shoulder I\u2019d probably go into full blown panic. Someone\u2019s phobia isn\u2019t less valid or real just because the thing they\u2019re afraid of is something a lot of other people find cute and cuddly. \n\nYTA. You had an opportunity to do a kindness and show some compassion by taking the next elevator. Honestly it\u2019s a little odd that you saw and heard this lady literally shrieking and still decided to take that unpleasant ride. Even if you had no empathy for her, you\u2019d think that you would want to take the next elevator for your own comfort and your dog\u2019s. But instead it seems like you imposed the proximity to your dog to prove a point.", "\nI normally take issue with the idea that someone else's phobia should dictate what I do and how I live my own life (that might make *me* an AH). \n\nHowever, unless the elevator had two exit doors and you were in no way impeding her exit then YTA. You basically had her \"cornered\" and often when someone is terrified they quite literally cannot think straight. So, there she is, seeing the object of her terror (all rational thought tends to vanish at this point) and there you are just watching her lose her shit and figure what? \"Meh, you're racist, girl\"!??", "YTA. The person has a fear, phobia or possible mental illness. Very rude or you.", "YES you absolutely are YTA.\n\nYou don't force a dog around a terrified person. Not just because it is horrifically cruel to the person. But it is also not nice to the dog, who can sense the fear and it will stress the dog out.\n\nDo no force your pets on other people. Do no force other people on your pets. You are being an irresponsible pet parent and very bad neighbor.", "YTA.   \n\n\nIt also does not matter how nice and well behaved your dog is, it is not visible to anyone.", "YTA: that person is very clearly scared of dogs, you could have waited for the next elevator. How tf is she meant to leave the elevator when the dog is in her way? She was pushing up against the wall to get away from them. It doesn't matter how well behaved your dog is, you should have waited", "YTA \n\n>\u201cif you don\u2019t want to be in the elevator with a dog you can take the next one.\u201d\n\nShe was terrified of your dog, having a panic attack while the dog wasn't in elevator yet and you actually expected her to be able to pass by your dog with ease.. you're a doctor? You're a bad one then.... doctors that ignore phobias are genuinely the most horrible ones.", "YTA phobias are no joke and they were in the lift first. You should have taken the next one, decency would not suggest they leave.\n\nAlso, *your* dog isn't scary *to you*. That's unsurprising. Who are you to say what a stranger should and shouldn't be scared of? What's an acceptable size before it's okay to be scared? How pointy must the teeth be before its reasonable to be weary? Must they be growling? This is how ridiculous you seem.", "YTA", "Nta there was a similar story on here previously and everyone basically agreed. If you live somewhere or visit somewhere where dogs could or would be it is up to you to mitigate your own fears. If she didn't want to be in the elevator with the dog she should have left the elevator with the dog. Service dogs exist and if she can't even see a dog without screaming she needs to learn how to manage her fear.", "NTA.  You didn\u2019t force her to share the elevator. She could have gotten off and waited for the next trip. Her phobia management is her responsibility. If she had a phobia about someone of another race or people of a certain gender, it would not be reasonable for her to expect them to avoid her. It\u2019s her responsibility to avoid them.", "YTA. They were already in the lift. You should have gotten the next one.", "ESH.\n\nHer phobias aren't your responsibility and the fact that she refused to eleviate her panic by not leaving the lift is her own fault. \n\nHowever, she was scared of your dog, you knew outright and you could have waited for the next one out of courtesy. Not doing so, is an asshole move as well.", "I think you should have just done her the favour of taking the next elevator, not because she is scared of dogs but because of your crappy attitude. You are the problem, not her or the dog.\n\nYTA.", "Nope, NTA. It's a shared building, with shared elevators. You and your dog have every right to use it. Considering the vast majority of apartment buildings don't allow dogs, it's EASY to find a building that will cater to such people.", "YTFA", "Yta what\u2019s wrong with you?", "YTA. Epically. And her reaction had nothing to do with the colour of your skin, more that you were an arrogant, unsympathetic man who practically bullied her into facing a fear. I\u2019m gobsmacked by your sense of entitlement in this scenario - next time wait for the next elevator.", "YTA. She was already in the elevator  \nand had an obvious panic attack when you entered. Yet you decided not to care because you don\u2019t think your dog is scary. YTA for not showing any compassion or consideration for your neighbors.", "YTA I have two staffies and even though they're extremely well behaved and obedient I still avoid people that have fear of them. Not only in my complex but throughout my neighborhood.  My choice of pets shouldn't be above someone's security of well being. So if i see someone who is evidently afraid of my dogs I'll wait for them to get away from us or I'll cross the road. And if I need to use the elevator, I'll do it only if it's empty. You could've possibly traumatize this poor girl by forcing her to be in a uncomfortable situation. When it comes to phobias even seconds are very damaging.", "There's a few layers to this. You're not OBLIGATED to wait for the next elevator, but you were an asshole for getting on with someone who was clearly terrified. My partner is very scared of dogs due to an attack when she was a kid. It doesn't matter if your dog is a good pupper, to someone with a phobia they are all really scary. \n\nYou could also swap this around, you were in the elevator first and she got on even though she had a problem with your dog. She is then arguing with you to get out and wait for another elevator even though you got on first. Surely whoever is the last one to get on should be the one to wait? Your argument for her to get off doesn't even make sense logistically. \n\nAsshole move for sure, please be more compassionate to people with phobias of your animals when you're out in public. That is your responsibility as a pet owner.\n\nYTA", "Easiest YTA ever.", "YTA. It's not discrimination to be afraid of dogs. Jeeze.", "YTA. No, you weren't under any obligation to wait or take another elevator. But it would have cost you nothing but a little time to be kind, and save that person a terrifying experience.

I don't know what yours is, OP, but I suspect that being trapped in a teeny metal box with no escape from it would not be fun for you.", "NTA", "Nta she can take the next one", "This might not be popular but NTA - if she wasn't comfortable, she could have taken the next one like you offered. Obviously her discomfort isn't that serious if it's not even worth a few seconds of her time.", "YTA. They were already inside, the girl clearly is terrified of dogs, yet you still go in and suggest she gets out? Talk about being entitled. Btw, I'm guessing where you live there's no rules regarding dogs in elevators but where I come from dogs can only ride the elevator when no one else is there and if the owner cleans afterwards (hairs, etc.) to avoid issues with severe allergies.", "Going against the grain with NTA and will probably be downvoted to hell, but this women shouldn\u2019t live in an apartment complex that allows pets if she is this terrified of dogs. Op is probably paying a premium to be allowed to have a pet and she has just as much right to the elevator.\n\nIf you are scared of dogs you should not live in a pet friendly apartment complex. This is obviously a large fear for this woman and I sympathize with that, but I feel she is not being proactive in avoiding her triggers.", "NTA. You and your dog have every right to use the elevator at your place of residence. The woman chose to live in a pet friendly building.", "YTA and deserve eviction", "NTA. If she\u2019s that scared of a dog she should take the next lift", "NTA. not your problem. if she is that terrified of daily life than maybe she just needs to stay home...or be in a dog proof fucking bubble.

Not sure why we have to pamper stupid strangers for everything. this generation is nothing but a bunch of whiny babies.", "NTA, SPECIFICALLY  \n\nbecause if the phobia is that bad, they shouldn't live in a pet friendly building. That's setting themselves up for constant panic or terror. I doubt you're the only one with a dog in the building. That was going to happen at some point regardless and at some point it's her job to stop screaming at everything that stresses her out. \n\nAlso, in any case, in any mental illness or phobia.... why is it fine that she's handling herself like that?
