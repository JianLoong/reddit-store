Convicted of an assault charge for calling for protection. I saw him after he had a fucking black eye. But because hes a POC, they were both drunk, and he was 6'4 to her 5'3 they arrested him.\n\n\nAnother friend met with his baby mama at a hotel to tell her her couldn't help her with her being suicidal and she needed to seek professional help. She broke her own nose claimed he did it filed all sorts of charges against him ruined his reputation in the community. Ruined his relationship with his ex wife who refused to let him see his oldest after this incident. And the dude is still on probation.. but now she's telling him how it was thebworst mistake of her life she loves him and shes sorry (but won't recant). This guy's entire life was fucked.

Of the three of us, can you guess who spent the night in jail?", "I was a police officer for a couple of years, I actually spent a year or so in a DV department.\n\nWe arrested the man more often, probably around 95% of the time actually. This was for a mixture of reasons, but never because we wanted to be toxic or because the police 'fucking suck'. \n\nDV's are the most dangerous, explosive incidents for the people involved. The risk of physical harm occuring in that context is way higher than most others. As such, leaving the parties together after a report is rarely, if ever an option. Someone has to go, and taking them any place other than custody risks the ejected party just going back, and then what? The police get the blame.\n\n99% of the time, there will be two stories, and someone, if not both of the involved parties, will have criminal records, and previous for DV. The stories will conflict, when people are emotional they will embellish, there simply is no way to know who is telling the truth. \n\n90% of the time, neither party will want to press charges against the other, and there will be no injuries, making it harder again to tell what actually happened. If one of them wants to make a report, the other one often does too, but the vast majority of the time, neither party wants anything done.\n\nI can't tell you how many times a man called the police, just to tell us to fuck off when we got there, women too, sure, in fact women did it more often.\n\nGiven all this, you HAVE to play the odds. Most of the time, women are the victims of serious domestic harm, not men. Even where women are the instigators, they end up getting hurt. There are many cases where this isn't true, but you can't behave for the 1%.  So, you play the odds, and, you give the woman time to either pack her things and leave, or if she owns the place, to change the locks. Rarely do they do that, but part of safeguarding, and the police protecting themselves, is giving them the opportunity. \n\nBasically, if a woman accuses the man of violence, and the man accuses the woman, and you have no idea who is telling the truth, what do you do? You deploy common sense, and air on the side of caution. The man is more likely to cause the woman harm, so you remove him from the equation, and, here in the UK, slap him with a DVPO (a civil order), separating them for 28 days, giving them both time to sort their shit out. \n\nIt's biased against men, sure, but that's out of NECESSITY, and not because the police suck. They make the best out of an impossible situation.\n\nIt's like when people talk about rape statistics, and question why so many men get off free. Sure, the system is shite, but what it really boils down to is that the system is set up that way out of necessity, and respect for innocent until proven guilty.\n\nThere are 10's of other reasons the man gets taken away too, but these are the most salient."]}
