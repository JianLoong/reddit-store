Next time, be supportive, or at least neutral, and then laugh in private about it later.\n\nI do want to applaud you for the way you've talked about what a crapshoot it seems to be to get into these colleges - it is hard to blame you for laughing when you weren't like \"I was super smart that's why I got in\", but instead \"this is luck of the draw and you should apply to a real safety school just in case\".

I worked in test prep for a few years and often gave admissions advice to families. Having a couple safeties is Admissions 101. And I would always tell students that grades are not everything - colleges want to see students who are well-rounded in their life experiences. Just being a good student - even valedictorian - is not enough when you\u2019re applying to Ivies. They got a million valedictorians applying to them. You need more than good grades to stand out.\n\nAnd even if you are an amazing student with lots of other things to offer, you still can be rejected for  completely arbitrary things outside of your control. My example I would give to students would be - say the university is looking for a bassoonist for its orchestra, which obviously you would not know as an applicant. They have your application next to another that is similar to yours in all ways - grades, awesome essay, etc. - but that person plays the bassoon while you don\u2019t. So they get admitted and you don\u2019t. And you will never know that\u2019s why someone got picked over you, that it was over something that you could not have controlled or improved upon. It sucks, but that\u2019s the way admissions works especially at top level schools who can afford to be so picky. \n\nI gotta ask - what were his SAT/ACT scores? If he was below a 1500 or 34, that is an easy way to immediately get rejected from Ivies. Did he have any other extracurriculars (or jobs or volunteering) besides debate?", "ESH. He blew you off and was a bit arrogant, but being valedictorian and yet getting rejected by all the schools to which he applied is pretty crushing.

I guess if you don\u2019t like your brother, whatever, but it\u2019s your brother. He could never talk to you again because you think so little of him. Maybe give him a reality check.", "I have advice for you brother about going to community college with the intent to transfer: \n\nSpeak to the college's transfer counselor about his plans so he can ensure that the classes he takes will transfer. \n\nThere are advisors that help people put together schedules, but the transfer counselor is the one who know the ins and outs of transferring credits to different universities. Don't waste time and money on classes that you don't need. \n\nHe'll probably ignore you again but it's worth mentioning.", "NTA, always amusing when the actual AHs get knocked down a peg or two. Tell him you hope he has fun at community college while your up at one of his dream schools lol. Nothing wrong with community college, but since he felt the need to talk to you like he was better than you in every way and if you could get in then he would have no problems getting in twist the knife a little more on him because he deserves it.

You know it is 'random' from your experiences, as the older brother. He is young and doesn't have the privilege of that knowledge.\n\nWas he being arrogant? Sure. Should he have been more reasoned about it? Definitely. But he was a teenager. You can't honestly always expect mature behavior, especially when he hasn't live long enough to have some of the formative experiences you mentioned.\n\nAlso, not applying to backups could have instead been a function of being terrified of not getting into a school meet what he perceives to be yours, or more likely your parents, expectations.\n\nSimilarly the arrogance could easily be a facade to hide his fear.

Those years mostly consist of a bunch of required courses that have little to no bearing on your intended major, except that most schools require them.  \n\n\nFor example, I intended to have biology as my major for my bachelor's, but for my associates I was required to take a Total wellness course (graded me on going to the school gym and basic nutrition info), a psychology course, an English literature course, and an American history course (focusing on history before the Civil War, a bit more in depth than what I learned in public school), amongst other courses not really pertaining to biology or other related sciences.\n\n\nThe only real difference between a community college associate's and a university associate's is that the university associate's costs more, but has the university's name on it.", "Rubbing your brothers nose in his own arrogance is part of sibling stuff. It's expected.", "I heard recently on the news that really the group that will have the most challenging college admissions process is kids from top public schools. I wish kids knew that, even being valedictorian at your well rated public school is not enough anymore to be competitive with private school students who have aspects of their education hyper focused on getting into elite schools. At the same time, they don't have the diversity (in race and background) advantage of kids who excel while at lower ranking public schools in poorer districts. Schools want the money of the rich private school kids but also like to say they admit poor students too. Doesn't mean it's impossible for upper/middle class public school kids to get in, but it is much harder than people tend to think.", "Community colleges often have professors who are better teachers.  University professors often have their own research that they'd much rather be doing and were originally hired by the university for research rather than teaching, so they don't always put much effort into teaching.  Community colleges don't do much research, they are mainly dedicated to teaching, so they hire professors for their teaching abilities rather than their research.", "Absolutely true.

If the school you are going to offers PhDs I can almost guarantee virtually all '100' and '200' level classes and a significant proportion of higher level classes will be taught by PhD candidates, not professors. Many that are \"taught\" by the professor will have labs run by grad students that comprise a good share of the class hours. \n\nIt's called publish or perish for a reason.

NOT how to teach it. \n\nWant a chance at professors who actually want to teach & are likely better at it? Stay the hell away from the research colleges. I was recruited by several Ivy League and other top schools. I didn't know all this at the time, but wasn't really interested anyway. It was kinda cool to get packets from places like Harvard, though I gotta admit. \n\nI went to a state school with an excellent reputation for the major I wanted and got a great education. I know plenty of people who did their first two years at a CC, transferred for their final two years, saved a hell of a lot of money, and are a credit to their professions. \n\nIvy League & other top schools get a lot of hype. It's kind of like buying a Porsche vs a Dodge. They will both get you from point a to point b. Both will be reliable. Both will have most of the same standard items. Sure, heated seats & such may be standard on the Porsche & options, or possibly not available on the Dodge. \n\nI've driven cars with heated seats, and let me tell you, in a Wisconsin winter, those things are sweeeet. But once the car has had a little time to warm up, they aren't that helpful anymore. Let's put it this way. I wouldn't pay extra for heated seats.

The number of legacies and minorities who want to go to, say, Harvard or Stanford vastly outnumber the number of available spots. Harvard accepts almost 2000 students a year, with an acceptance rate of about 3-4%. Their most recent stats show that about 15% are Black. (\"underrepresented minority\" includes other ethnicities as well, but for the sake of available data, we will focus on Black students.) This means there are about 300 seats for Black students. There's less data for the ethnic breakdown of applications, but a 2019 article estimates that about 11% of the applicant pool is Black. Assuming this number doesn't fluctuate too much, that means, with a pool of about 60,000 applicants, 6600 were Black, with 300 being accepted, or 4.5%. In other words, even with a diversity bump, the odds are still not great. \n\nIn the same vein, the number of legacy applicants vastly outnumbers the number of available spots. The only legacy applicants really guaranteed seats are those who are famous, or whose family donated large amounts. Your regular straight A honors student, whose engineer dad went to Harvard, isn't going to see a huge legacy boost because their parent just isn't important enough. \n\nNow, as to OP's brother being a valedictorian. There are about 26,000 valedictorians a year in the United States, and the trend of multiple valedictorians is increasing. This number is greater than the number of spots at Ivy League schools. Not every valedictorian can get a seat. (And that's not getting into the weeds of differences in difficulty between high schools, which brings into question how meaningful that title actually is.)\n\n(And let's not even get into internationals for Ivy+ schools. UCs might value them because of tuition, but the acceptance rate for internationals at Ivy+ schools are even lower than that for domestic applicants.)\n\nAs someone who came from a nationally renowned magnet/prep high school and then went to and worked at multiple elite colleges, it is more random and less calculated than you think it is. I met kids at these elite schools less smart or driven than some of my high school classmates whose best offers were less prestigious state schools. Some kids were identical in profile, yet they had different outcomes. Yet other students were absolute geniuses, and others were smart in important but non-obvious ways. Many people have trouble understanding the scale of numbers these admission offices are working on. They cannot accept every smart Joe out there, and chances are, there are a hundred other applicants who wildly outclass him in every way possible. \n\nAt any rate, it sounds like OP did explain to him how this works. But he ignored them. Even if he didn't listen to OP, there are counselors and teachers and classmates he could have consulted. Heck, even forums like A2C, which have a few admission officers, could have helped him out. \n\n> diversity quotas to receive public funding\n\nThe consideration of race in public university admissions in California was banned by Proposition 209 many years ago. The Bakke vs UC Davis decision banned racial quotas years before that. \n\nAre there other ways to try and boost \"diverse\" enrollment? (In quotes, mostly because these definitions often prioritize racial diversity, as opposed to say, socioeconomic diversity.) Yes, of course.
