Next time, be supportive, or at least neutral, and then laugh in private about it later.\n\nI do want to applaud you for the way you've talked about what a crapshoot it seems to be to get into these colleges - it is hard to blame you for laughing when you weren't like \"I was super smart that's why I got in\", but instead \"this is luck of the draw and you should apply to a real safety school just in case\".

I worked in test prep for a few years and often gave admissions advice to families. Having a couple safeties is Admissions 101. And I would always tell students that grades are not everything - colleges want to see students who are well-rounded in their life experiences. Just being a good student - even valedictorian - is not enough when you\u2019re applying to Ivies. They got a million valedictorians applying to them. You need more than good grades to stand out.\n\nAnd even if you are an amazing student with lots of other things to offer, you still can be rejected for  completely arbitrary things outside of your control. My example I would give to students would be - say the university is looking for a bassoonist for its orchestra, which obviously you would not know as an applicant. They have your application next to another that is similar to yours in all ways - grades, awesome essay, etc. - but that person plays the bassoon while you don\u2019t. So they get admitted and you don\u2019t. And you will never know that\u2019s why someone got picked over you, that it was over something that you could not have controlled or improved upon. It sucks, but that\u2019s the way admissions works especially at top level schools who can afford to be so picky. \n\nI gotta ask - what were his SAT/ACT scores? If he was below a 1500 or 34, that is an easy way to immediately get rejected from Ivies. Did he have any other extracurriculars (or jobs or volunteering) besides debate?", "ESH. He blew you off and was a bit arrogant, but being valedictorian and yet getting rejected by all the schools to which he applied is pretty crushing.

So he didn\u2019t take your advice no reason to kick him when he is down.

I guess if you don\u2019t like your brother, whatever, but it\u2019s your brother. He could never talk to you again because you think so little of him. Maybe give him a reality check.", "I have advice for you brother about going to community college with the intent to transfer: \n\nSpeak to the college's transfer counselor about his plans so he can ensure that the classes he takes will transfer. \n\nThere are advisors that help people put together schedules, but the transfer counselor is the one who know the ins and outs of transferring credits to different universities. Don't waste time and money on classes that you don't need. \n\nHe'll probably ignore you again but it's worth mentioning.", "NTA, always amusing when the actual AHs get knocked down a peg or two. Tell him you hope he has fun at community college while your up at one of his dream schools lol. Nothing wrong with community college, but since he felt the need to talk to you like he was better than you in every way and if you could get in then he would have no problems getting in twist the knife a little more on him because he deserves it.

You know it is 'random' from your experiences, as the older brother. He is young and doesn't have the privilege of that knowledge.\n\nWas he being arrogant? Sure. Should he have been more reasoned about it? Definitely. But he was a teenager. You can't honestly always expect mature behavior, especially when he hasn't live long enough to have some of the formative experiences you mentioned.\n\nAlso, not applying to backups could have instead been a function of being terrified of not getting into a school meet what he perceives to be yours, or more likely your parents, expectations.\n\nSimilarly the arrogance could easily be a facade to hide his fear.

Those years mostly consist of a bunch of required courses that have little to no bearing on your intended major, except that most schools require them.  \n\n\nFor example, I intended to have biology as my major for my bachelor's, but for my associates I was required to take a Total wellness course (graded me on going to the school gym and basic nutrition info), a psychology course, an English literature course, and an American history course (focusing on history before the Civil War, a bit more in depth than what I learned in public school), amongst other courses not really pertaining to biology or other related sciences.\n\n\nThe only real difference between a community college associate's and a university associate's is that the university associate's costs more, but has the university's name on it.", "Rubbing your brothers nose in his own arrogance is part of sibling stuff. It's expected.", "I heard recently on the news that really the group that will have the most challenging college admissions process is kids from top public schools. I wish kids knew that, even being valedictorian at your well rated public school is not enough anymore to be competitive with private school students who have aspects of their education hyper focused on getting into elite schools. At the same time, they don't have the diversity (in race and background) advantage of kids who excel while at lower ranking public schools in poorer districts. Schools want the money of the rich private school kids but also like to say they admit poor students too. Doesn't mean it's impossible for upper/middle class public school kids to get in, but it is much harder than people tend to think.", "Community colleges often have professors who are better teachers.  University professors often have their own research that they'd much rather be doing and were originally hired by the university for research rather than teaching, so they don't always put much effort into teaching.  Community colleges don't do much research, they are mainly dedicated to teaching, so they hire professors for their teaching abilities rather than their research.", "Absolutely true. I worked at a competitive program in a good school (we only admitted 10% of applicants in my department).  It was a tough program, so students dropped each year.  And the biggest applicant pool was for incoming freshman coming from high school.\n\nSo the ratio of seats to applicants was much better for someone looking to enter as a sophomore or junior coming from somewhere else (like a community college).  It was well know that this was a good path to get in if you weren\u2019t admitted as a freshman.", "What year? That context makes a big difference", "It should be noted that California has made a very clear point of trying to make that work by having a more unified higher education system. It's a great option in California to get into the 4 year state universities, but I'd be hesitant to generalize it.", "If going to community college means host degree won\u2019t cost him an insane amount, it\u2019s definitely the smartest option.\n\nThere\u2019s no point rewarding a university that just sees you as a cash cow.", "My SIL is transferring from one of our local CCs to Berkeley this fall. It really is the better route imo as well.", "Well, I guess you\u2019ll just have to bring up his college rejections every time he starts mouthing off for the rest of his life.", "But it literally says he was a valedictorian?", "I doubt it, those schools are just crazy competitive. Way more people apply than they have room to accept, and most of them have the same excellent grades and a bunch of extra curriculars and shit. There just aren't guarantees unless you're a legacy or whatever.", "Is it?", "OP said in comments that \u201cit was satisfying to see him fall on his face\u201d.", "Yeah, YTA.", "Curious - are you *in* California? Because if not his straight odds of UC Berkeley were miniscule.", "**WOW** keep it civil. \n\nThey said that they knew people with great resumes *do* get rejected, but because they just wanted to see their brother fail, decided not to act after first attempt.\n\nIf you actually care, you would try to help multiple times, not just once.", "I am just about to graduate from a community university. Being that my program is small, I got opportunities to work on research projects for classes and a paid research assistant position. Most of my projects are making an actual impact in the real world and all of this helped me get accepted for my master's program. Don't knock community schools. They rock.", "This is not actually true, even in research universities teaching is weighed equally with research, and a lot of what you are evaluated on re: research is your ability to mentor students in research. Source- work in a university and am married to a professor.", "Happened with my SIL just this year, she did two years of CC and starts at Berkeley this fall ahead of where she needs to be unit wise for her bachelor's.", "\n\n>WOW keep it civil.\n\nfirst off, lol. if you think I was being uncivil, I would hate to see how you react to *actual* uncivil responses. \nsecond, what exactly do you think op was supposed to do? tie him down and force him to apply to a safety school? if someone is determined to screw themselves, you aren't gonna stop them", "Eh, really depends on the university, and where you're from. In the US a lot of higher-end (not Ivy League but a good bit above average) schools do focus on research. Can't tell you how many professors from those types of universities were excellent in their field, but utterly useless in the classroom and delegated 90% of the actual work to TAs, a practice that was encouraged by and even suggested by the university", "Eh, maybe at your university.  But not universally true.   \n\nIf you're brilliant enough and/or bring in enough grant money, your teaching skills are far less important.  \n\nI've had professors mumble at blackboards/PowerPoint presentations at two different well regarded research universities.  \n\n/many stop giving a shit about mentorship once tenure is granted.", "Of course the brother shouldn\u2019t have said that. But if someone encounters a significant misfortune, laughing about it like this just isn\u2019t right.", "Kicking someone when they are down really isn\u2019t a good look. Doesn\u2019t work for OP, doesn\u2019t work for you.", ">Kicking someone when they are down\n\nThe brother can't be too down, he still gets to go to college.", ">Kicking someone when they are down\n\nBut they aren't down are they? They still got to get their education just not where they wanted. All because they didn't listen. It's funny because it's so typical of young men they think they know everything and their arrogance is their undoing. \n\nActions have consequences. \n\nI will ALWAYS think it's funny when young arrogant people think they know it all and get face squished with humble pie", "Yeah, but that\u2019s simply because you are an asshole. \n\nReveling in kids facing misfortune after being stupid is really weird. Kids that age are stupid. It comes with the age. Literally. Frontal lobes and all that. Taking delight in it? Well. You do you. Empathy works for most, but you do you.\n\nAnd yes, failing to achieve a significant life goal is a misfortune. They are down. Of course, you\u2019d need even a little empathy to realize that.", "You\u2019re completely right. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m surprised that nobody in his life sat him down and explained to him how university admissions work.\n\nOP is also ignorant on how the process actually works as well. It\u2019s not \u201crandom\u201d, it\u2019s calculated.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that her brother was valedictorian. The university admissions process is extremely biased; legacy applicants, minorities and international students are prioritised. \n\nUniversities have a diversity quota to meet in order to receive public funding. It\u2019s grossly unfair, but so is life.\n\nOP\u2019s brother was cocky and arrogant. He should\u2019ve applied to more schools. But he was also naive, he clearly didn\u2019t understand how the admissions process works, which is why he thought he\u2019d be accepted to at least one of the schools he applied to.\n\nGetting rejected hurts, and OP was cruel for laughing at him. She even said that she was glad to see him \u201cfall on his face\u201d. That\u2019s just awful."]}
