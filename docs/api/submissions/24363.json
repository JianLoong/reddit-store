I don\u2019t think that makes me an expert, but from getting in and meetings lots of others that did too, all I can say is, it\u2019s completely fucking random. I\u2019ve meet Olympians, kids who\u2019ve published full length novels, kids who run successful companies; I\u2019ve also met kids who have essentially good grades and normal extracurricular activities.

I said fine, his funeral. \n\nHe ended up getting rejected by every college he applied to, had to scramble to apply to colleges with rolling admissions dates, and ended up having yo go to community college for two years. \n\nI heard this when I came home to visit during summer break. Given the context of him being so arrogant about his application and denigrating mine, I found it incredibly funny. So I started laughing about it. He got angry and called me an AH for laughing at him instead of being supportive. \n\nI honestly think he had it coming.

He put you down in an arrogant way and your comeback wasn\u2019t out of line given the circumstances.", "NTA because you went out of your way to help him with his app and he took the opportunity to not listen to you and make a dig at you. Although I'd still probably comfort him, since he's your brother, after all. Pray that those two years in community college will humble him a bit.", "I mean, it's not great.", "ESH. He was arrogant but I don't think it rose to the level of having you be happy over his misfortune.", "NTA. There are few things as satisfying as arrogant asses being given a nice slice of humble pie with a scoop of nice crisp reality on top.", "eh, NTA I guess since the consensus seems to be that he had it coming --- but also beware when you dance on someone else's grave...the dirt is loose.", "NAH.  He was expecting to go to Harvard and he's going to Podunk Community College.

Saving the giggles for the privacy of your room would have been a better call. \n\nI do have some sympathy for him. When you're valedictorian, you think the world is your oyster, and honestly there's a level of pressure for you to excell in life, to go to the best colleges. He probably feels like he can't live up to that pressure. Doesn't excuse the arrogance though. \n\nJust apologize for laughing but also tell him to don't play the victim, kick ass in community college for two years, save up money, then go to university, even if it's not Princeton.", "NTA.

You didn't need to put salt in the wound by laughing and saying he deserved it.\n\nYTA", "Leaning between NTA and ESH. He should have been realistic and applied to a safety. What he said was also a jerk thing to say. However, he\u2019s probably going through a hard time getting rejected from literally every college.

Your brother shouldn\u2019t have been so cocky or insulted you but he\u2019s already been knocked down multiple pegs. He *knows* you told him so, he *knows* you were right. This isn\u2019t some rando acquaintance, this is your brother, and honestly this might impact your relationship for decades to come.", "Exactly, when I actually was giving him support he was a dick about it, so how can he expect it whenever it\u2019s convenient to him?", "Honestly he\u2019s as arrogant as ever so go figure", "He was proud and assumed his outstanding performance would assure him a slot.

Yea, OP did warn their brother, but it's like laughing at a preventable tragedy. Sure, say I told you so, but laughing at him is excessive", "She wasn't mean all she did was inappropriately laugh.\n\nHe was rude and arrogant by saying he could get in on his own.", "He did help.

Be nice to your bro, nothing wrong with community college and transfering. It's usually the best choice since the top schools are for networking", "It's very very satisfying to see somebody get their comeuppance, it totally is, it's just not good behaviour to show that satisfaction. It kinda opens the door for him to laugh at you when something doesn't turn out the way you want it to and it just doesn't help the situation. Next time, be supportive, or at least neutral, and then laugh in private about it later.\n\nI do want to applaud you for the way you've talked about what a crapshoot it seems to be to get into these colleges - it is hard to blame you for laughing when you weren't like \"I was super smart that's why I got in\", but instead \"this is luck of the draw and you should apply to a real safety school just in case\". Hard to blame you, but yeah, ESH, not laughing at your brother would have been the best for everybody involved.", "I'm sure it was, but you should've kept it to yourself.  This is a life changing event.  There's nothing wrong with CC, I did my first two years at CC and I think anyone who has to take out student loans to go to college is a fool if they don't do their first two years at a CC.  But Ivies are next level, you're not paying for the education, you're paying for the alumni network that you just don't get at any other school in the world.  However much he deserved it you're still kicking a man when he's down, probably the lowest point of his life.", "Ok, but he's 18.  If he was 40, or even 25 I would agree with you.  But 18?  Come on.  I retract my ESH comment and it should be NAH. Neither one of them is mature enough to be the AH.  And I hope this doesn't screw up their relationship.", "no, she was right to be honest, but an a hole for laughing in his face when he didn\u2019t get in. I\u2019m sure he already was humiliated, sometimes we don\u2019t have to say \u201cI told you so\u201d. Sometimes we can just be the bigger person.", "IMO, laughing at someone else's difficulty is mean.\n\nHis being an AH is not in question.", "He deserved it \n\nOP tried to help him but he was arrogant thought he knew better.\n\nGuess he didn't", "Why should she, he thought he knew better then the experienced person. \n\n>kicking a man when he's down\n\nHow is he down? Lol he's still going to collage", "then maybe he shouldn\u2019t have laughed and said that unlike op his application is good enough not to need to apply to safeties \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", ">someone else's difficulty\n\nHe doesn't have any difficulties lmao \n\nWhat he had was arrogance and then was made to eat some humble pie. OP tried to help and tell him the type of people they saw but the brother \"knew better\"\n\nNo we are laughing at him having to eat humble pie. Just think if he had the grades he would of transferred from collage to a better school.\n\nHopefully from now on he will take the advice of experience"]}
