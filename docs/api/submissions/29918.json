Mark and I have lived together since we started uni as we were best friends all throughout high school and our families have always been close. Alexa moved in with us our second year as we found a 3 bedroom apartment much closer to the uni that we couldn\u2019t afford on our own. \n\nMark met his girlfriend (Amy) about two years ago and at first everything was fine, she came over most weekends and we all got along so there was never a problem. That Christmas Mark and I drove back to our hometown together because we lived on the same street and my car isn\u2019t really great for winter driving. Before we left Mark had to stop at Amy\u2019s house to pick up some things he had left there the night before and when we got there Amy was furious saying that if he really loved her he wouldn\u2019t  drive me as it\u2019s disrespectful to their relationship and I would try something. Mark told her I was just a friend and that he promised nothing would happen (it didn\u2019t). \n\nWhen we got to our hometown we found out one of our high school friends was having a party so we both went. Amy found out we were both at this party and called him freaking out demanding that he left and that she didn\u2019t want him and I out together unless she could supervise. She even called me and explained that she knew what I was doing and that I couldn\u2019t stop him from loving her and she made it very clear that she was going to be in his life forever and I was temporary. \n\nEver since that Christmas Mark and I haven\u2019t been as close. I didn\u2019t want to interfere with his relationship so I gave him space, we\u2019re still living together but even now I feel like I can\u2019t talk to him.\n\nWe\u2019re all in our final year of uni now and since Mark and I are in the same program we have most of our classes together and we attend all the same campus events. Amy claims I go to these events to get close to him without her around and I\u2019m tired of it so I avoid him at the events. Amy spends almost every night at our apartment now and it\u2019s been extremely uncomfortable for me. She calls me a whore if I\u2019m wearing shorts and consistently tells me \u201cshe\u2019s won Mark and I lost the game\u201d. This past week I officially snapped at her. \n\nI came back from a date with a guy from work and I caught her in my room on my laptop snooping through my messages with Mark. I told her she was crazy and that she needed to get the fuck out of my house or I would call the cops. Mark wasn\u2019t home at the time so she left and when Mark came home he freaked out on me calling me inconsiderate and rude. I told him this is just as much my house as it is his and if she couldn\u2019t respect my privacy then I didn\u2019t want her here. Alexa sided with me as she also feels uncomfortable when Amy is around and doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong. \n\nAmy hasn\u2019t been back here yet and Mark thinks I need to apologize for what I said but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong so AITA?", "created_utc": 1698602077, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17j8ggs/aita_for_kicking_my_roommates_gf_out_of_our_house/", "score": 224, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I wouldn't allow anyone who called me a whore in my home, that's for sure. Why does Mark allow her to disrespect you like that? Second offense.  \nGoing through your computer is so out of line and intrusive that it defies logic that he has \"freaked out on me calling me inconsiderate and rude\". Is he serious???

Why didn't you move out after the first Christmas incident or ask Mark to move out instead of avoiding him and inconveniencing yourself?\n\nHe chose to take her crazy side and you spent the rest of your time feeling uncomfortable in your own home and avoiding him at events, letting this girl talk trash about you, and letting her increasingly stay in your shared apartment until she massively violated your privacy. Why? Do you have trouble standing up for yourself?\n\nYou need to grow a backbone and get higher standards. Mark is not your friend. Treat yourself and your space with more respect, and never allow yourself to be disrespected so egregiously again in the future.", "She overstepped a major boundary and invaded your privacy, and she's TA for doing that, and you are completely justified in being angry with her about it. Yes, she's insecure and possibly projecting, and that's not fair to you.\n\nWith that said, imagine that a woman posted here that:\n\n* Her boyfriend drove home from Christmas with another woman, who was single and unrelated and of about the same age, alone together in the car.\n* She found out - through other people, not by either her boyfriend or the other woman informing her - that her boyfriend then went with that same other woman to a party the same night.\n\nI am certain that the responses would be filled with people warning her about red flags, that Mark was probably cheating on her, and that she should consider breaking up with him. Mark's promise that nothing would happen, and any assurances from him or you afterwards that nothing happened, would be universally dismissed on the basis that cheaters routinely lie.\n\nThat is the perspective Amy has been operating on, and honestly, I can understand and sympathize with both sides of this.\n\n*You* know that you and Mark are just childhood best friends who have stayed friends as you grew up, that neither of you have any romantic sexual interest in each other, and that with that context a car ride home from Christmas together plus going to a mutual friend's party are perfectly innocent and reasonable activities. *You* know that you and Mark just coincidentally happen to be pursuing similar academic paths.\n\nAmy *does not have that context knowledge*. Without that context, the events you described look *extremely* suspicious, and she had reasonable grounds to *suspect* that Mark *might* be cheating on her with you, or that you might be trying to tempt him into it. With that suspicion as the basis of her viewpoint, the two of you going to many of the same classes and events is then further supporting evidence of the suspicion.\n\nHer attitude towards you is unfair, aggravating, and undeserved, and you are 100% justified in being pissed off about it. At the same time, she developed that attitude for significant reasons that should have been readily apparent to you.\n\nI think it's probably too late to really salvage the situation now, but if you want to try, you would have to somehow convince her to accept and believe that you simply don't think of Mark in that way at all. In her terms, that instead of \"losing the game\", you *never even played the game in the first place*, because in your mind that \"game\" did not even *exist*. She will not believe any simple assertion to that effect, because if her suspicions were true then obviously you would lie about it. To have any chance of convincing her, you would have to explain your background with Mark, how long you have known each other, and how growing up with him has influenced you to view him as a purely platonic friend. You would have to refute, not her suspicion itself, but the *grounds* of her suspicion, the reasons that her suspicion is founded on.\n\nUnfortunately, I would expect that her suspicions have grown and dug in too much by now for convincing her to be reasonably possible. To have a decent chance of success, you needed to nip her suspicions in the bud by explaining this to her much earlier, when her suspicions had only barely begun, or even before then. To have a *good* chance of success, you would have had to additionally take care to consider her perspective and avoid giving her the appearance of suspicious activities.\n\nSoft ESH, because while Amy is definitely TA, you should have considered how your actions with Mark would appear to her before doing things that would give her reasons to suspect cheating.\n\nUnfortunately, I think you're going to find that Mark is going to have to choose between you as his friend and Amy as his girlfriend, and that the possibility of coexisting is gone.", "NTA...and if anyone is owed an apology, it's you, from both Amy AND Mark!", "NTA, she's gonna drive a wedge between him and every single one of his friends until he's miserable", "Nta.  She should  have been out on her ass long before this.  If she was treating you like this.  \n\nIf he'd been any type of friend he'd have put a stop to this nonsense long before and made it clear her suspicions were unfounded paranoid drivel.  You can't drive down the road together or go to the same party.  You sleep in the same house ffs if you were both wanting that kind of relationship it would hardly be difficult.   \n\nDespite this nonsense you have continued to put up with her jabs and suspicions and outright accusations and you have sacrificed  the closeness of your friendship as a result.    And even with all these concessions she still crossed the line.  She broke into your room  and looked through your personal computer.   Is this the first time she's done this. You don't know.

Full stop. \n\nJust for shits n giggles, if Mark was a female roommate with a male SO that acted the same way I think that would\u2019ve happened a long time ago. I feel like in Amy\u2019s head that meant you accepted the premise on some level. It also set mark up to expect you to put up with this behavior like he does. \n\nLife lesson here: set boundaries early and often. Someone calling you a whore once is enough.

OP have you talked to him about it? In a \u2018Im worried about you\u2019 way. Because if this was a man not allowing his gf to have friends, isolating her and freaking out like this we\u2019d all be very worried for her and recognise it as abusive. It\u2019s the same here. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this, I hope he can see the light eventually.", "The laptop does have a passcode on it and i genuinely don\u2019t know how she figured it out", "Well, he's not thinking with the right head", "That costs money\n\nOpen the window first", "C'mon, open the window, they're not a steak.", "Yeah, this GF definitely has a personality disorder, probably something Cluster B like BPD or maybe NPD. \u201cMark\u201d is likely dealing with his own issues or else he never would have trauma bonded with Amy. He is not seeing clearly and if he stays with her she will 100% wall him away from you anyway. The way I see it, there are three possible paths with two possible outcomes:\n\n1. You say nothing, Mark stays with Amy and drifts away from you \n2. You express your opinion about Amy, Mark stays with Amy anyway, and isn\u2019t your friend any longer \n3. You express your opinion about Amy, Mark sees the light and stays your friend \u2026 plus he doesn\u2019t get entangled with a crazy woman\n\nI suppose that technically, you could say nothing and Mark figures out on his own that Amy is batsh!t, but this seems unlikely.\n\nClearly the best path is to say *something* \u2026 you need to think long and hard about how to present this to Mark in a way that he is more likely to listen to.", "Oh no. Check your room and entire house for cameras. Get your laptop checked for anything she might have downloaded to track your key strikes, etc. Change your passcode and give it to nobody. Get a lock for your door in case she has a key to your home.", "Does Mark know your code?  Also, does that girl have a key to your place?", "Seriously people, if you\u2019re going to defenestrate someone, do it the right way and don\u2019t cause property damage!", "Thanks for making me spit out my water all over my kindle, it needed a good cleaning.", "Can we please not add to the stigmatisation of mental health disorders. She is probably just controlling and insecure. Doesn't mean BPD or NPD", "Actually, sometimes these things are posted on here to make a point to a person who refuses to see reason, such as somebody who literally takes the side of somebody who literally got caught snooping."]}
