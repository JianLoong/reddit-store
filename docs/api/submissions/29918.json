Before we left Mark had to stop at Amy\u2019s house to pick up some things he had left there the night before and when we got there Amy was furious saying that if he really loved her he wouldn\u2019t  drive me as it\u2019s disrespectful to their relationship and I would try something. Mark told her I was just a friend and that he promised nothing would happen (it didn\u2019t). \n\nWhen we got to our hometown we found out one of our high school friends was having a party so we both went. Amy found out we were both at this party and called him freaking out demanding that he left and that she didn\u2019t want him and I out together unless she could supervise. She even called me and explained that she knew what I was doing and that I couldn\u2019t stop him from loving her and she made it very clear that she was going to be in his life forever and I was temporary. \n\nEver since that Christmas Mark and I haven\u2019t been as close.

Why? Do you have trouble standing up for yourself?\n\nYou need to grow a backbone and get higher standards. Mark is not your friend. Treat yourself and your space with more respect, and never allow yourself to be disrespected so egregiously again in the future.", "She overstepped a major boundary and invaded your privacy, and she's TA for doing that, and you are completely justified in being angry with her about it. Yes, she's insecure and possibly projecting, and that's not fair to you.\n\nWith that said, imagine that a woman posted here that:\n\n* Her boyfriend drove home from Christmas with another woman, who was single and unrelated and of about the same age, alone together in the car.\n* She found out - through other people, not by either her boyfriend or the other woman informing her - that her boyfriend then went with that same other woman to a party the same night.\n\nI am certain that the responses would be filled with people warning her about red flags, that Mark was probably cheating on her, and that she should consider breaking up with him. Mark's promise that nothing would happen, and any assurances from him or you afterwards that nothing happened, would be universally dismissed on the basis that cheaters routinely lie.\n\nThat is the perspective Amy has been operating on, and honestly, I can understand and sympathize with both sides of this.\n\n*You* know that you and Mark are just childhood best friends who have stayed friends as you grew up, that neither of you have any romantic sexual interest in each other, and that with that context a car ride home from Christmas together plus going to a mutual friend's party are perfectly innocent and reasonable activities. *You* know that you and Mark just coincidentally happen to be pursuing similar academic paths.\n\nAmy *does not have that context knowledge*. Without that context, the events you described look *extremely* suspicious, and she had reasonable grounds to *suspect* that Mark *might* be cheating on her with you, or that you might be trying to tempt him into it. With that suspicion as the basis of her viewpoint, the two of you going to many of the same classes and events is then further supporting evidence of the suspicion.\n\nHer attitude towards you is unfair, aggravating, and undeserved, and you are 100% justified in being pissed off about it. At the same time, she developed that attitude for significant reasons that should have been readily apparent to you.\n\nI think it's probably too late to really salvage the situation now, but if you want to try, you would have to somehow convince her to accept and believe that you simply don't think of Mark in that way at all. In her terms, that instead of \"losing the game\", you *never even played the game in the first place*, because in your mind that \"game\" did not even *exist*. She will not believe any simple assertion to that effect, because if her suspicions were true then obviously you would lie about it. To have any chance of convincing her, you would have to explain your background with Mark, how long you have known each other, and how growing up with him has influenced you to view him as a purely platonic friend. You would have to refute, not her suspicion itself, but the *grounds* of her suspicion, the reasons that her suspicion is founded on.\n\nUnfortunately, I would expect that her suspicions have grown and dug in too much by now for convincing her to be reasonably possible. To have a decent chance of success, you needed to nip her suspicions in the bud by explaining this to her much earlier, when her suspicions had only barely begun, or even before then. To have a *good* chance of success, you would have had to additionally take care to consider her perspective and avoid giving her the appearance of suspicious activities.\n\nSoft ESH, because while Amy is definitely TA, you should have considered how your actions with Mark would appear to her before doing things that would give her reasons to suspect cheating.\n\nUnfortunately, I think you're going to find that Mark is going to have to choose between you as his friend and Amy as his girlfriend, and that the possibility of coexisting is gone.", "NTA...and if anyone is owed an apology, it's you, from both Amy AND Mark!", "NTA, she's gonna drive a wedge between him and every single one of his friends until he's miserable", "Nta.  She should  have been out on her ass long before this.  If she was treating you like this.  \n\nIf he'd been any type of friend he'd have put a stop to this nonsense long before and made it clear her suspicions were unfounded paranoid drivel.  You can't drive down the road together or go to the same party.  You sleep in the same house ffs if you were both wanting that kind of relationship it would hardly be difficult.   \n\nDespite this nonsense you have continued to put up with her jabs and suspicions and outright accusations and you have sacrificed  the closeness of your friendship as a result.    And even with all these concessions she still crossed the line.  She broke into your room  and looked through your personal computer.   Is this the first time she's done this. You don't know.

Full stop. \n\nJust for shits n giggles, if Mark was a female roommate with a male SO that acted the same way I think that would\u2019ve happened a long time ago. I feel like in Amy\u2019s head that meant you accepted the premise on some level. It also set mark up to expect you to put up with this behavior like he does. \n\nLife lesson here: set boundaries early and often. Someone calling you a whore once is enough.

OP have you talked to him about it? In a \u2018Im worried about you\u2019 way. Because if this was a man not allowing his gf to have friends, isolating her and freaking out like this we\u2019d all be very worried for her and recognise it as abusive. It\u2019s the same here.

He is not seeing clearly and if he stays with her she will 100% wall him away from you anyway. The way I see it, there are three possible paths with two possible outcomes:\n\n1. You say nothing, Mark stays with Amy and drifts away from you \n2. You express your opinion about Amy, Mark stays with Amy anyway, and isn\u2019t your friend any longer \n3. You express your opinion about Amy, Mark sees the light and stays your friend \u2026 plus he doesn\u2019t get entangled with a crazy woman\n\nI suppose that technically, you could say nothing and Mark figures out on his own that Amy is batsh!t, but this seems unlikely.\n\nClearly the best path is to say *something* \u2026 you need to think long and hard about how to present this to Mark in a way that he is more likely to listen to.", "Oh no. Check your room and entire house for cameras. Get your laptop checked for anything she might have downloaded to track your key strikes, etc. Change your passcode and give it to nobody. Get a lock for your door in case she has a key to your home.", "Does Mark know your code?

She is probably just controlling and insecure. Doesn't mean BPD or NPD", "Actually, sometimes these things are posted on here to make a point to a person who refuses to see reason, such as somebody who literally takes the side of somebody who literally got caught snooping.", "Do not apologize for anything. If she had called me a whore she would have lost her teeth.", "NTA - and you need to reconsider your friendship with Mark, who's a lame for being with such a jealous nutjob.", "NTA OH MY GOD. Amy is fucking insane. Also Mark sucks ass for letting his gf trash talk his best friend like that for absolutely no reason at all. And now even siding with her when she went through your stuff in your room?? He must be stupid. Sorry. Having to deal with that in your own house is just awful too. Mark needs to get his shit together, tell Amy to not be rude at the very least and applogize to you together. Otherwise she has no business being at the house in my opinion.", "NTA That said, I would file a restraining order. Tell Mark Amy is lucky you didnt call the cops. Also, if she is in school with you, immediately go and file sexual harrassment charges against her. Yell Marl you will do the same against him if she ever enters ypur home again or speaks to you.", "I'm going to go with ESH.  First of all Amy, for being so insecure and jealous and not constructively communicating her concerns with Mark and instead pretending that there's some type of competition between you and her ; also for snooping on your computer, which was 100% out of line. Also Mark, for not making Amy feel secure and reassuring her that he loves her, even if it means limiting the time he spends with you.  And lastly you, not because you expect Amy to respect your privacy, but for not seeming to understand that Mark now has a girlfriend and therefore will inevitably be spending less time with you. I understand that you and Mark have been friends for a long time and that your families are close, but now that he has a girlfriend she is (and should be) his first priority.  It'd be the same if the shoe were on the other foot ; if you found a boyfriend then he would be the most important person in your life and Mark would have to take a back seat, so to speak.  This is just something that plutonic friends must be prepared for when one of them finds a romantic partner.  It seems to me that you are still monopolizing a lot of Mark's time.  While that understandably upsets Amy, she should be taking it up with him, not with you.  But you should be mindful that Mark's primary attention now belongs to Amy, not you.", "NTA. Her behavior is inexcusable.", "NTA. Mark has no balls. Please tell him that.", "Nta, but, man, she sounds unhinged. He really doesn\u2019t care that she went into your room and broke into your secure laptop to snoop on your messages to him? Girl already shouldn\u2019t be staying over nearly every night and not paying any money and calling you a whore for dressing comfortably at home. It was 100% your call to kick her out especially when he wasn\u2019t there. She doesn\u2019t pay rent or live there! A lot of rentals say no overnight guests more than so and so many days a week. It\u2019s not her home. It\u2019s yours. You would have been right to say I don\u2019t want her coming over anymore after she called you a whore multiple times. His place too, but would have warranted a discussion on how often and definitely not without him. \n\nYou say your families are close. Is there anyone he would listen to if advice was given that you could talk to about this? Not saying call the flying monkeys (first time I ever have kinda wanted to), but see if someone he respects might be up for a conversation with him just to check in and just say he\u2019s heard it\u2019s been rough, but no details.", "Initially it\u2019s insecure, now it\u2019s crime committing red flags\u2026\nMake sure Mark knows and remembers it\u2019s YOUR room his damn gf was in and YOUR laptop she was snooping. \nRemind Mark it would have been fine if it was HIS room and HIS laptop YOU wouldn\u2019t care. \nI\u2019m just glad at least Alexa is on your side. \nI think Mark has been brainwashed and yes, your friendship is officially ruined. \n\nI\u2019m (not so) secretly wondering if Mark has/had a crush on you that made Amy so on the tip all the time lol. NTA duh", "NTA. She was incredibly out of line going into your room and SNOOPING AT YOUR COMPUTER! There is something seriously not right with her. I really hope nobody in Mark's life has a pet rabbit. \n\nYou and Alexa have to tell Mark how uncomfortable Amy makes you feel.

I hate when people shit on BPD.", "Good chance of just being controlling & insecure. If she does have a mental health disorder she deserves help & to learn how to manage it. But that has nothing to do with being Mark's GF. Not OP's circus, not her monkeys.", "I agree.  Reading between the lines I get the impression that OP kind of resents that Mark now has a gf.  Especially since OP says that \"at first everything was fine, she came over most weekends and we all got along so there was never a problem.\" That being said makes me think that Amy is not wholly the problem and I can understand why she would be upset.  According to OP the problem started when she and Mark drove home together for Christmas.  While that in and of itself is not a red flag for Amy I can see a potential for concern.  I also get the impression that Mark, in continuing to maintain such a close friendship with OP, wants his cake and eat it too.  Where Amy is wrong is in not taking up her concerns with Mark but rather take it out on OP.", "You know he's just gonna give it to her again, right?\n\nSure hope Mark pulls his head out bf he marries/had kids with this psycho but that's on him. \n\nNTA", "My entire life!", "As do I. Not everyone with BPD acts the same.", "Fair enough on the stigmatization, I apologize for that, but the advice to talk to Mark is still solid, and frankly the Mark / Amy relationship is anything but healthy.", "Thats how im feeling.

OP deserves to feel safe in her home too.", "It\u2019s OP\u2019s laptop and OP\u2019s room that Amy invaded though, so I\u2019d say OP gets a say here. Mental health disorder or no, Amy still doesn\u2019t have the right to invade OP\u2019s privacy.", "There is definitely more to this then whats been said. I get the feeling that Mark might have more to do with Amy's behaviour than OP might also know. This amount of jealousy and insecurity doesn't just come out of nowhere.", "I'm going to start saying it!", "I\u2019d like to use eviscerate,  which could happen during defenestration \u2026", "Totally right. I was thinking of the relationship btwn Mark & Amy and if Mark can see if Amy's being controlling or are there signs that Amy needs help. \n\nAmy needs to stay away from OP regardless.", "Yeah nah some people are just genuinely toxic and unhinged and it has nothing to do with anyone but themselves.", "You are not wrong there."]}
