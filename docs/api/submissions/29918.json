Mark and I have lived together since we started uni as we were best friends all throughout high school and our families have always been close. Alexa moved in with us our second year as we found a 3 bedroom apartment much closer to the uni that we couldn\u2019t afford on our own. \n\nMark met his girlfriend (Amy) about two years ago and at first everything was fine, she came over most weekends and we all got along so there was never a problem. That Christmas Mark and I drove back to our hometown together because we lived on the same street and my car isn\u2019t really great for winter driving. Before we left Mark had to stop at Amy\u2019s house to pick up some things he had left there the night before and when we got there Amy was furious saying that if he really loved her he wouldn\u2019t  drive me as it\u2019s disrespectful to their relationship and I would try something. Mark told her I was just a friend and that he promised nothing would happen (it didn\u2019t). \n\nWhen we got to our hometown we found out one of our high school friends was having a party so we both went. Amy found out we were both at this party and called him freaking out demanding that he left and that she didn\u2019t want him and I out together unless she could supervise. She even called me and explained that she knew what I was doing and that I couldn\u2019t stop him from loving her and she made it very clear that she was going to be in his life forever and I was temporary. \n\nEver since that Christmas Mark and I haven\u2019t been as close. I didn\u2019t want to interfere with his relationship so I gave him space, we\u2019re still living together but even now I feel like I can\u2019t talk to him.\n\nWe\u2019re all in our final year of uni now and since Mark and I are in the same program we have most of our classes together and we attend all the same campus events. Amy claims I go to these events to get close to him without her around and I\u2019m tired of it so I avoid him at the events. Amy spends almost every night at our apartment now and it\u2019s been extremely uncomfortable for me. She calls me a whore if I\u2019m wearing shorts and consistently tells me \u201cshe\u2019s won Mark and I lost the game\u201d. This past week I officially snapped at her. \n\nI came back from a date with a guy from work and I caught her in my room on my laptop snooping through my messages with Mark. I told her she was crazy and that she needed to get the fuck out of my house or I would call the cops. Mark wasn\u2019t home at the time so she left and when Mark came home he freaked out on me calling me inconsiderate and rude. I told him this is just as much my house as it is his and if she couldn\u2019t respect my privacy then I didn\u2019t want her here. Alexa sided with me as she also feels uncomfortable when Amy is around and doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong. \n\nAmy hasn\u2019t been back here yet and Mark thinks I need to apologize for what I said but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong so AITA?", "created_utc": 1698602077, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17j8ggs/aita_for_kicking_my_roommates_gf_out_of_our_house/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No one has the right to invade ur privacy, especially not over psychotic jealousy. And how u dress up in ur own home is none of her business. Lastly, if she is so insecure abt her boyfrnd, they need to work on building that trust instead of dragging u into their mess. As for him asking u to apologise to her, tell him to ask his girlfriend to apologise to u for her behaviour the entire time. While he's at it, he should apologise to u too, for not being able to console her girlfrnd, turning a blind eye to her behaviour towards u and taking her side when she was clearly in the wrong.", "NTA !!!\n\nAmy is so insecure I have to wonder if she's projecting. \n\nIf I came home and found someone in my room, *on my computer,* they'd be out the door so fast, there'd be a sonic boom.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
