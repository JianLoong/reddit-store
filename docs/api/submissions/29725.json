AITA?\n\nIt's hard to believe you understand how he's feeling. Also if you should be able to admit the following...it's pretty shitty to tell somebody they don't deserve to be a parent over something like your interpretation of his excitement. YTA", "WOW\n\nYTA so hard.\n\nYou owe your husband a huge apology. He wanted to be there with you and was excited to welcome your child into the world and you STILL told him NO. His feelings were not as important as what you wanted, and karma stepped in to teach you a lesson. You treated your husband like second choice and now you expect him to be as happy and excited to get a chance that he should have had to begin with, but you refused to allow him?\n\nI do not even see this marriage lasting if this is how you treat your husband. Perhaps if you couldn't be excited to share the birth of your child with your husband who is the father, YOU don't deserve to be a mother.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS--I hope this is rage bait.", "But it is true. He is your \u201csloppy seconds\u201d, You only want him with you because your sister can\u2019t be there.\nNow while it is your birthing experience and you\u2019re 100% in control of who you want in the room. The way you went about. . . It makes you undoubtedly an asshole.\n\nWho are you to tell him he doesn\u2019t deserve to be a father? That way you\u2019re acting what makes you think you deserve to be a mother? Hormones, and all that.. very much. Yes? \n\nBe better, pregnancy doesn\u2019t give you free license to say, and do whatever you want.\n\n YTA", "YTA you basically told him that he couldn\u2019t see the birth of his child. He\u2019s the dad and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s equally excited to be a dad and wanting to see the birth of his kid, YOU took that excitement away by disrespecting his position of your PARTNER and child\u2019s FATHER. Imagine your kid growing up and finding out their dad missed their birth because their mom was too stubborn for their dad to be apart of their family. I sincerely feel bad for your husband and you need to apologize. If it were me in his position I\u2019d leave you in a heartbeat.", "YTA  - Your husband was not wrong. You only want him there now because your sister can't be there. You place your relationship with your sister as your \"best friend\" over your relationship with your husband.  It would be one thing if you were saying that your sister had experience or skills that would assist in the birth but you didn't you merely wanted to share this experience with her as opposed to sharing ot with your husband who is supposed to be your partner.", "YTA.\n\nYou wanted your sister in the room with you. You're married? I thought husbands come before sisters in a marriage? Call me naive, but I thought marriage was between 2 people.\n\nYou shut him out of the delivery room. It's also his kid. Way to treat him like a sperm donor. Did you ask your sister if the father of your child could be there for the birth? \n\n100% you're the asshole. YOU married him. I think, in most successful marriages, the other partner puts their partner first.\n\nYou 100% fucked your marriage up.", "Your husband wanted to be your birthing partner, you didn't want him, he was upset.\n\nNow you want him, but only because your sister isn't there, and he's still mad because he is the child's father and felt he has a right to be there but you were all *no no no it's all about me.* Do you seriously not see why an expectant dad would feel hurt that you're cutting him out?\n\nSo you...tell him he doesn't deserve to be a father? Because he's mad that you expect unconditional, unquestioning devotion from him even as you treat him like he's not important?\n\nAre you TRYING to end up alone and unloved? YTA.", "YTA. You just told your husband that he's second choice. And basically he's only going to be there because he's the last choice. How do you think he feels. You sound very heartless. Your sister could have supported you atbhime but your husband should have always been the one in the room", "Ma'am.\n\nYTA doesn't even begin to describe how poorly you handled this. It's his child too. It's bad enough that you chose your sister over your husband in the first place. He's your *husband*. Your baby's *father*. He has EVERY right to be upset with you, even after you changed your mind due to your sister's predicament.\n\nBut then you said something that was incredibly hurtful. **Incredibly hurtful.** He doesn't deserve to be the father **of his own kid?!** Jesus Christ, OP. How else did you expect him to react?!\n\nSo yes. YTA. Major, *major* YTA.", "So I always say the mom gets to decide who she wants in the room with her because it\u2019s her medical procedure. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have to deal with the consequences of that decision. This is his child too and it sounds like he has been very involved. Of course he is going to be hurt that you chose someone else to be at the birth of his child. That pain isn\u2019t going to go away just because you let him play second fiddle and now you have to deal with the consequences of that. YTA that you expect him to just get over it.", "YTA- He's hurt and upset that he was your second choice. If your sister hadn't had drop out from doing it, he wouldn't even be near the delivery room to watch his child be born. He's been involved in everything. And after all this, you said something very hurtful that you may not recover from. Saying he doesn't deserve to be a father, because he's upset that he wasn't your first choice and is \"sloppy seconds\" is very low.\n\nIt is your choice who you want with you, but you do have to suffer the consequences of your choice.", "I\u2019m guessing it was your sister who got you pregnant\u2026. Oh wait\u2026 the man who got you pregnant YOUR HUSBAND\u2026 the FATHER of your child is bummed because he was a sloppy second\u2026 maybe it\u2019s YOU who don\u2019t deserve to be a mother\u2026 see how ridiculous that sounds\u2026 YTA!", "YTA first he begged and pleaded to be in there.  Then *you* pushed him out in favor of your sister.  Now all of a sudden he\u2019s good enough to be in the room with you.  So can you blame him??  He\u2019s not your first choice and he knows it.\n\nSo while it\u2019s your choice and that\u2019s fine.  You can\u2019t get upset when he\u2019s got mixed feelings and reactions.", "Too right, YTA.  You expect your husband to be excited that now all of a sudden he will be allowed in the room, after you absolutely crushed him in favor of your sister?  You've told him basically that he is second choice and you expect him to be elated?\n\nWow.", "YTA. It sounds like it was really hurtful that you chose your sister over him for the birth of his child. Instead of letting him have upset feelings and express that to you, you did a low blow and told him he didn\u2019t deserve to be a father. His reaction didn\u2019t have to do with the baby, but your earlier decision.", "YTA for every single reason your husband stated.  He's correct.", "Yta and you sound like the same kinda people that would put your kids safety second to your sister but I fully agree with your husband that you just see him as your sloppy seconds and now want him to be happy about something that you could just as easily as take away if your sister is able to make it back in time telling him he\u2019s doesn\u2019t deserve to be a dad is a low blow and disrespectful you\u2019re the one who\u2019s rude and Ass not your husband", "YTA.  I know this will get me in trouble because every time I point out that, yes it is the woman who gives birth, but the child being born is just as much a product of the father as the mother, therefore the father does have a right to be involved in the pregnancy and birth, I get yelled at.\n\nDon\u2019t care, you are wrong.  You can\u2019t tell your husband you don\u2019t want him in the room, then when your first choice backs out be pissed that you are grudgingly turning to him and he isn\u2019t appropriately appreciative in your eyes.  You are rude and unkind.  When you found out only one person could be with you, if your husband wanted to be there then that was his right.  You denied him and I am surprised he took it as well as he did.  I hope you treat your child better than that.  A selfish mother can really damage a child.", "YTA. His feelings of rejection are valid and you are wrong to dismiss them.", "YTA\n\nYou need to think about where your husband fits in because apparently your sister is your best friend but then you've got another best friend you confide in.  Is your husband even in the top 3 of your best friends?  Shouldn't he be your number one, at least until you have your child?", "YTA. WTF?? Who takes this moment away from their husband?? I could see if he was squeamish around blood or whatever and didn't want to be there or was just a totally useless partner, but that doesn't seem to be the case. \n\nLook,  it's your body, your birth, your choice but holy hell, I totally get why he wasn't excited to be your *second choice*.\n\nJesus.", "YTA, do we even need to discuss why? I mean seriously you don\u2019t choose family but you choose the person you want to spend the rest of your life with. You chose to have a baby together, but then you chose to have your sister in the delivery room. \ud83d\ude44Then at the last moment and only when she becomes unavailable do you decide to allow him in for the birth of HIS child. Your behavior is shameful and you shouldn\u2019t have been surprised by his poor reaction. Then you dug in like the stubborn person you clearly are and said he doesn\u2019t deserve to be a father. Personally it sounds like you don\u2019t deserve him and you definitely don\u2019t deserve to be a mother. Sorry I\u2019m blunt, but this is nasty behavior by you.", ">He said I value my sister more than him and only see him as a backup because my sister can't help me out. I told him that's not true but then he brought up how my sister values her husband more than me and I should learn how to treat him from her.\n\nAt no point do you explain how this wasn't an extremely accurate assessment. YTA.", "YTA denying him from being in the room in the first place and making this while situation dramatic when it should have been about the two of you from the beginning.", "YTA. That\u2019s so absurd. You did value your sister over him. What he\u2019s saying is right, albeit crudely - he is the \u201csloppy seconds\u201d. Learn how to be a wife", "Sloppy seconds is kinda what he is though. If your sister was able to make it he wouldn\u2019t have been in the room. I get she\u2019s your best friend and have known her since you or hers birth but that is your husband ma\u2019m. Your sister was perfectly fine putting her husband\u2019s needs above yours but you won\u2019t do the same?\nSo YTA", "a husband who WANTS to be there when his child is born and you pick your sister over him?\n\nGet over yourself. YTA.", "YTA He doesn\u2019t deserve to be a father, because he\u2019s no longer excited to be in the room with you?! Ummm\u2026he WAS excited until you told him you wanted your sister. \n\nWise up.", "I\u2019m wondering how you can type this out and still wonder how you\u2019re not the AH. Or at least how you can\u2019t even try to see your husband\u2019s side of it. Your husband is completely right to feel like he comes second to your sister. You only wanted him there when it became apparent your sister wouldn\u2019t be available.\n\nI understand your right to have whoever you want in the delivery room but when your husband actively wants to be involved and he isn\u2019t your first choice it is going to cause resentment and upset on his part. It\u2019s a very delicate situation to be in and while if you feel your sister is the best person to support you through labour then absolutely you should ask her, you also need to be prepared to walk the delicate tightrope of turning your husband down as sensitively as possible. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just the way I\u2019m reading the post but it is coming across as you only thinking about yourself without any regard for what hurt you might be doing to your husband and now that he has pointed out why he feels that way you still knock him down and think he is wrong. Take a step back and just try to think how you would feel in his shoes and to understand the natural hurt he is feeling.\n\nN T A for wanting the person you feel is best positioned to support you in the room but huge YTA for how you have and continue to treat your husband over the issue", "YTA. You wouldn\u2019t have this baby if it weren\u2019t for your husband. He deserves to meet it when you do. Yes, labor and delivery is hard and scary. But unless the husband is abusive or a narcissist, he should always be in the room when the baby is born.", "YTA, you can choose who is in the room with you but expecting your husband to not be upset that chose someone else is crazy. To double down and expect him to be excited now that he can come as your back up plan is just gross", "YTA. You already told your husband he wasn\u2019t wanted, that you don\u2019t value his support. I do understand wanting your sister there, but this is not her child. This is your husband, the father of the baby you made together, and you made him feel worthless, unnecessary and probably unloved. *You hurt him* and you don\u2019t seem to care at all. You\u2019re only having him in the room because your sister can\u2019t be there. If she made it back in time, he probably expects to be kicked out in favor of her. You can\u2019t be surprised that he feels like this. He deserves better than you. Do you even value him as a husband? It\u2019s seems you chose everyone else over him.", "YTA and congratulations on making him resent you during a time that was supposed to be special for the both of you. You wanting your sister there, I can understand. How did you justify that he\u2019s not sloppy seconds? From what I read, you wanted your sister, she couldn\u2019t due to an emergency in her family, and then you went to your husband\u2026 that\u2019s second place. I hope it was only the pregnancy hormones that made you said he didn\u2019t deserve to be a father because if you\u2019re that cruel normally, you don\u2019t deserve to be a wife. Even with the pregnancy hormones that was unacceptable.", "YTA. It is how your husband states, he is the 2nd option and you wouldn\u2019t have even considered him had it not been for your sister backing out. It is both yours and his child you\u2019re giving birth to, he should be the #1 choice when it comes to who can be in the room with you, especially since only one person is allowed. Your sister definitely showed who she prioritizes more between you and her own husband, it makes sense why your husband would bring that up since he wasn\u2019t prioritized by his own wife for the birth of his child.", "YTA - it is exactly true though. You only asked him to be in the room because your first choice can\u2019t make it. You made it clear you would prefer to have someone else support you.", "YTA \n\nThat was his child too but you decided you\u2019d rather have your sister in than the father to your child. What message does that send? That you\u2019ll always prioritise your sister over your husband.", "YTA. If this is how you treat your husband, he deserves a better wife.", "YTA.\n\nYou need a reality check.", "You are the AH. Your husband's response is totally warranted. You just told him he could be there for the birth as your first choice wasn't available. \nBirthing partners are obviously a personal choice but your choice hurt someone that helped you create this baby. He even told you how much it means to him and you've not even acknowledged that.", "YTA, you were TA from the beginning when you picked your sister over him.", "YTA. Hopefully this was a one-off occurrence and you aren\u2019t this insufferable all of the time or you will have to start referring to him as your ex-husband.", "YTA - He is right, he is your sloppy seconds. You would never tell him that he could be in the delivery room if your sister didn't have to go to the funeral.", "YTA. Everything your husband said is 100% correct. \n\nIm also sure you\u2019ll be in for a shock when your sister will pick her husband when in your position.", ">This started an argument and I told him if he's not excited to be in the room with me when our child is born then he doesn't deserve to be a father.\n\nHis reaction is to you, and his excitement to being in the room is tied to your treatment of him. How does his fatherhood come into play? He didn't tell you that not wanting him in the room means you deserve to be a single parent and don't deserve a co-parent or to go co-parent with your sister now. He said he wanted to meet, together with you, the child that you both created. This is about the couple. Don't weaponize the child (and their relationships) that has not even taken their first breath outside of the womb. Would you appreciate someone telling you that if you're weaponizing your child, you don't deserve to be a mother? \n\nEven without a backstory, the idea of \"not being excited to be in the delivery room = doesn't deserve to be a father\" leaves an impression of \"YTA, change my mind.\"", "Y...T...A, all day.", "YTA\u2014 you absolutely did treat him like he wasn\u2019t a priority when it is you and HIS child.. not you and your sister\u2019s child.\n\nI would have loved nothing more than my husband to have been in the delivery room with me for the birth of our twins and I know he even 4 years later is upset he couldn\u2019t be there for me and our babies.", "Your friend is right. I'd be understandably hurt as well. For the initial exclusion and the calculated-to-hurt comment afterwards. YTA for sure.", "YTA. I can never tell if these crazy one's a re real or not. But you sound awful. The way you speak to your husband and disregard his feelings is shameful. You're going to have a child together soon, stop being such an ass.\n\n>\"if he's not excited to be in the room with me when our child is born then he doesn't deserve to be a father\"\n\nJust awful. He wanted to be there. YOU'RE the one who was going to make him miss it, until your sister had something better to do.", "Yta for so many things.\n\nFirst you didn't let him to be the first (beside you of course) to welcome HIS OWN BABY into to world.\n\nSecondly you didn't care about his feelings when he tried to convince you.\n\nThirdly you chose your sister over your husband regarding the baby of you two.\n\nFourthly you threw a bone to him only when your sister stepped back and required him to not bw salty about it.\n\nLet me clarify his feelings for you: HIS OVER THE MOON FUL OF JOY HE CAN BE IN THE DELIVERY ROOM.\n\nHe ia just bery disappointed in you ans he has every right to feel this way because YTA. A huge one.\n\n\nNote: I fully support the idea of \"the one in labor the one who decides\" in case of people who are not the parent of the newborn. E.g. If MIL wants to be in the delivery room and even her son wants her to be there the woman giving birth can say no and everybody should respect her decision. I myself won't want anybody in the delivery room with me. (It's not even a costume in my country. Sometimes the father of the child is presents but definitely nobody else.) It's also a decision a pregnant woman can make. But forcing the father out of the delivery room and letting somebody else in there is just so wrong.", "Dammed if you do. Dammed if you don\u2019t. \n\nDad will ask to hold the baby. OP will say he cannot ever hold the baby. 3am and the baby is crying. Dad is asleep. She will complain how he never holds the baby. \n\nRoyally YTA.", "YTA.  Complete and total AH.  Even your title of this thread is basically a lie.  You owe your husband a huge apology and you need to stop being so selfish.", "Yup, definite case of YTA. You do value your sister more than him, she was your first choice to share the special moment with (you even argued to have her there), and yes, he is the backup, because you didn't change your mind on the importance of his presence for the birth of HIS child until your sister had something else going on.  You need to value his presence in your child's life, OP.", "YTA. You chose your sister over him and then expected him to be excited that she couldn\u2019t make it and he got put in as a backup?", "YTA, he\u2019s the father of your child and your husband.

You are extremely mean to have first prioritized your sister over your husband when it\u2019s literally his child and not hers, and then you insulted him after he expressed his valid feelings.

The fact that you were excluding the father of your child in favor of your sister must have been soul crushing for him.

That you didn't *immediately* understand why he was muted when he was offered to come in as the second option.\n3. Your angry comment to him, which was OTT.\n4. Your complete lack of remorse.\n5. The fact that you even have to ask \"AITA?\".\n\nA lack of empathy, such as you have displayed, would have me very worried about your child.

He feels like he is sloppy seconds, and you really need to prioritize him. Maybe you don't deserve to be a wife.", "YTA. You can't be serious. You were taking this moment from him and now you think he should be grateful because you've been forced to possibly allow him in the room.

Well, isn't that a good demonstration of who your 1st and 2nd choices are? Your husband's not wrong for saying that he's just your sloppy seconds because from your own story, that's how you see and treat him. Frankly, it's weird to choose your sister over your husband, who is I assume the father of the child, to be with you during birth.

You need to cut the apron strings with your sister a bit if you want your marriage to last.

OP you really fucked up your marriage IMO. \n\nOh and your sister is also an asshole for accepting it in the first place and not telling you that you were wrong.

Good luck to your husband.", "YTA, I can see his point of view. You were very dismissive of his wishes to be in the room, as a support person to you and also to witness the birth of his baby. You were the one who devalued his role in both these situations. \n\nNow you're only asking him because your sister probably can't be there, and you expect him to be excited? Why should he be excited? He still doesn't know whether you actually WANT him there. \n\nIf your sister comes back in time, will you dump your husband for her again? It must be difficult for your husband to get excited about something so momentous, when he still knows you could change your mind at the last minute if you get a \"better\" option. \n\nPlus you said he doesn't deserve to be a father if he doesn't want to be there - yet you were the one who said he couldn't be there in the first place.

I also almost died both times and those were not the images i wanted to leave my husband with. He deserved not to have that trauma. Thankfully i made it and so did my kids but if we hadnt, he would have been left with basically the twilight birth scene lol. That being said everyone is different and different strokes for different folks.", "Think what you want but everything I said is in context to the OP not my full opinion.  Idc about you. \ud83e\udd23 you\u2019re just a drama queen on reddit. You\u2019re a nobody to me. \ud83d\udcaf", "I understand why you would not want him there. I guess if you\u2019re in a good relationship with good communication that\u2019s different. I\u2019m wrapped up in the perspective of the OP and not everyone\u2019s situation. I apologize to all the ladies I was a bit aggro with. Not every situation is the same."]}
