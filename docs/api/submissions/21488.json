And I can see how a parent might think their request was \"reasonable\". But at the end of the day, having a kid doesn't mean everyone around you has to change their behavior. \n\nI do think your friends might be onto something. Sorry if this is too much since this isn't really an advice subreddit. But your post reads as you having a confrontational and abrasive attitude. If that carries into your regular life, that might be part of the reason your neighbor got upset with your interaction together. Obviously she crossed a line by insulting you.

You may be a little inconsiderate for her family's needs and wishes and you could have accommodated her request but your are not obligated to.

I agree with your friends.", "YTA\n\n99% of the responses here are completely missing the point that this sub isn't \"Am I Entitled To\" or \"Is It My Right To\" (as usual). It's called \"Am I The Asshole\" for a reason: because sometimes you're absolutely entitled to do something, but doing it is nonetheless a really obnoxious, asshole-y thing to do. Which is absolutely the case here.\n\nFirst of all, your entire argument is that you choose to vacuum at that time because \"it won't bother most people\". And yet your neighbour is literally telling you that it IS bothering her, which voids your argument, since she's one of the people you're supposedly trying not to bother. Is logic difficult for you?\n\nSecondly, contrary to what another commenter argued, she's not even necessarily asking you to vacuum at night when it might bother people. She's just asking you to give them a few hours so her husband can get some rest. She's asking for basic thoughtfulness, and she even offered to communicate with you and let you know when he was up, which means that you don't have to do any guesswork. And yeah, maybe it wouldn't work for you; but you weren't even willing to give it a try once or twice? Super asshole-y.\n\nThirdly, she came to you with a very reasonable concern as a neighbour, was polite about it, and you came back at her with aggression and rudeness, for *absolutely no reason at all*. You don't want people to judge you for having been a literal child when you had a kid, which is fine (I actually don't judge you, my heart breaks for you), but I'll be damned if I won't judge you for being 22 years old and not having learned a damn thing or grown up at all since then. You're STILL behaving like an aggressive, immature 14-year-old. Sad and worrisome, given that you're raising a child.\n\nAnd finally, a lot of people are judging E-S-H because of the hateful things your neighbour said, and no, she shouldn't have said them. But the reality is that she wouldn't have said a single one of them if you hadn't come at her the way you did. She was reacting, not aggressing. And I'm not going to judge her an asshole for *responding* to you being unbelievably rude to her for no reason at all by matching your energy.\n\nYTA. It doesn't matter what you're \"entitled to do\". The point is that you're thoughtless and an AH of a neighbour.", "And that's why vacuuming and making any kind of noise between 12 and 15 o'clock is forbidden in German apartment buildings.", "YTA\n\nYou escalated the dispute.

And even if they want more favors, one is free at any time to approve/deny requests as they see fit and appropriate - so it seems crazy to suggest holding a mentality that the first request should almost always be denied on principle. I am flabbergasted at this line of thought. Sure, there are people who take advantage of kindness, but again one can always recognize a pattern and readjust their response down the road. You aren\u2019t out anything by being nice the first few times before realizing that they are a little unreasonable and you might have to *politely* decline to accommodate all of their requests.
