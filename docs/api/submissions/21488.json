She started going off at me, calling me a childish whore, hinting at the fact that I was a teenage mother, called me a bitch, and then stormed into her apartment again. I\u2019ve talked to friends and while they say I\u2019m entitled to clean my apartment whenever I want within reason, I could have been a bit nicer, and that how I reacted was an dick move.", "created_utc": 1688655654, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14sbqld/aita_for_vacuuming_in_the_middle_of_the_day_and/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Instead of expecting them to put their daily lives on hold I bought a white noise machine and got some amazing silicone ear plugs.  You're not vacuuming at an unreasonable time.", "NTA.\n\nIf she didn't want to live in an apartment with paper-thin walls, she shouldn't have moved into an apartment with paper-thin walls. People do shit during the daytime. Her husband might bitch and moan about the noise, but that's not an everyday thing and he can mitigate it with earplugs.  The toddler is not going to fucking notice once he/she has been put down.", "NTA, doing it at night would disturb everyone else and this is a normal time of day to get things done", "NTA \n\nFrom what I've seen her attitude and tone pissed you off and not the request itself. And she quickly showed her real face and opinion about you when you said a simple \"no\" so you know you weren't making up her being condescending at the beginning.", "NTA", "You\u2019re not the asshole. It\u2019s your private space and I don\u2019t think that vacuuming in the middle of the day is disturbing public peace or something. \n\nOfcourse we may never know how the actual interaction went, it may have been a bit better to say that you can\u2019t stop vacuuming right now but you\u2019re open to suggestions on when it would be best to vacuum in the future. \n\nAsking you to stop and wait for her okay is incredibly entitled", "its always smart to maintain the vest relqtionship you can with nieghbors,.. if god forbid an emergency arises, they are the ones who can help and make the difference.\n\nNTA for vacuuming at a very reasonable how. Your nieghbor is an AH. I would call your landlord and let him know what hapoened, chances are this is not tge last time you will have to deal with rthis bad nieghbor.", "NTA.  What are you supposed to do?  Check with all your neighbors any time you want to do potentially loud chores?  In my experience if you give an inch they'll take a mile.", "NTA. You\u2019re vacuuming at a normal time. Unfortunately hearing every little thing is part of apartment living. As long as the noise is within reason then don\u2019t give it a second thought.", "NTA.\n\nAs a parent of two young children, the world does not revolve around me. As obnoxious as it is, our neighbor loves to cut their grass right at bedtime during the summer months. It's not unreasonable for her to do so. It just happens to coincide with bedtime for our kids.\n\nWe've never said anything to our neighbor because she's not doing anything wrong. It's annoying, sure. And I can see how a parent might think their request was \"reasonable\". But at the end of the day, having a kid doesn't mean everyone around you has to change their behavior. \n\nI do think your friends might be onto something. Sorry if this is too much since this isn't really an advice subreddit. But your post reads as you having a confrontational and abrasive attitude. If that carries into your regular life, that might be part of the reason your neighbor got upset with your interaction together. Obviously she crossed a line by insulting you. Without being there and seeing the exchange, it's impossible to say how things could have gone better. I just think it seems plausible you could be nicer. But we don't know each other, so I might be totally wrong!", "Esh\n\nShe started by asking nicely, *you* are the one that became confrontational, so she decided to lower herself to the level that you brought it to, so neither of you come off good. \n\nYou even began this story confrontationaly with the readers. You started by trying to make yourself the victim. \"My two kids and I live in an apartment\" and \"she hurled unnecessary crude insults at me\" would have sufficed.", "Obviously you can vacuum when you want during the day. But the way she framed her request seems pretty reasonable to me. I can't hear how condescending her tone actually was, but I feel like you could've been a bit more accommodating. Of course, nothing excuses her outburst after you said no. ESH.", "ESH. She asked nicely and you were super rude? Yikes", "It\u2019s hard to say. By your own words, she asked nicely at first, and you didn\u2019t respond nicely. You don\u2019t want to, and you don\u2019t have to, but I do not get the impression that you even considered altering your vacuuming schedule to be neighborly. She should not have turned on you but I\u2019m wondering if that could have been avoided. ESH.", "ESH.\n\nShe came to you with a reasonable request. You didn't have to adhere to that request but if you were going to say no, why be so aggressive about it? \n\nShe's your neighbour. She came to you and your neighbours with cookies. She clearly wanted to make an effort with you all. And there is so much value in getting along with people who live outside of your home.\n\nBut what she said to you in response of your outburst was disgusting.", "YNTA for wanting to clean in the middle of the day in your own apartment. You may be a little inconsiderate for her family's needs and wishes and you could have accommodated her request but your are not obligated to. To blow of on you for simple saying no to her request was out of line especially going on a personal level. You being a young mother has nothing to do with the whole situation. It is not lunch time nor is it late at night nor is it in the early mornings. A baby will be asleep a lot of the days worht and not everyone can schedule according to the needs of one baby. They sleep most of the day like what?", "ESH-\n\nShe asked very politely and you were a dick about it.\n\nStill its your right to vacuum during these hours .", "ESH, In addition to being needlessly rude, you said you do it because it wouldn\u2019t bother most people, and now you know that it does bother a significant portion of the people who actually hear it. (~\u00bc units next to you) Will you change your timing now?", "ESH.  You\u2019ve admitted it and she was awful.", "YTA. Not for vacuuming,  but for being an ass to a reasonable request.  You could have said no nicely. Or said when you could do it, but no, you had to escalate. I agree with your friends.", "YTA\n\n99% of the responses here are completely missing the point that this sub isn't \"Am I Entitled To\" or \"Is It My Right To\" (as usual). It's called \"Am I The Asshole\" for a reason: because sometimes you're absolutely entitled to do something, but doing it is nonetheless a really obnoxious, asshole-y thing to do. Which is absolutely the case here.\n\nFirst of all, your entire argument is that you choose to vacuum at that time because \"it won't bother most people\". And yet your neighbour is literally telling you that it IS bothering her, which voids your argument, since she's one of the people you're supposedly trying not to bother. Is logic difficult for you?\n\nSecondly, contrary to what another commenter argued, she's not even necessarily asking you to vacuum at night when it might bother people. She's just asking you to give them a few hours so her husband can get some rest. She's asking for basic thoughtfulness, and she even offered to communicate with you and let you know when he was up, which means that you don't have to do any guesswork. And yeah, maybe it wouldn't work for you; but you weren't even willing to give it a try once or twice? Super asshole-y.\n\nThirdly, she came to you with a very reasonable concern as a neighbour, was polite about it, and you came back at her with aggression and rudeness, for *absolutely no reason at all*. You don't want people to judge you for having been a literal child when you had a kid, which is fine (I actually don't judge you, my heart breaks for you), but I'll be damned if I won't judge you for being 22 years old and not having learned a damn thing or grown up at all since then. You're STILL behaving like an aggressive, immature 14-year-old. Sad and worrisome, given that you're raising a child.\n\nAnd finally, a lot of people are judging E-S-H because of the hateful things your neighbour said, and no, she shouldn't have said them. But the reality is that she wouldn't have said a single one of them if you hadn't come at her the way you did. She was reacting, not aggressing. And I'm not going to judge her an asshole for *responding* to you being unbelievably rude to her for no reason at all by matching your energy.\n\nYTA. It doesn't matter what you're \"entitled to do\". The point is that you're thoughtless and an AH of a neighbour.", "And that's why vacuuming and making any kind of noise between 12 and 15 o'clock is forbidden in German apartment buildings.", "YTA\n\nYou escalated the dispute. You could have accommodated her request and all would be well but you \"stood your ground\".", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
