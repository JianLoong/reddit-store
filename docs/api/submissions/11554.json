I apologize!\n\nMy family (mom, dad, older brother, me) live in Seoul, South Korea. My parents and brother are Chinese immigrants, and I was born here. The reasonw e live here is because my parents thought I was going to be a second son, and instead I came out a girl! \n\nMy brother is their golden child. He got to go to university, I had to drop out of school to care for them (they are in bad health). His accomplishments are celebrated, mine are ignored. It has been this way my whole life. \n\nI work overnight at a hotel cleaning rooms and taking items to guests, so after 12 hours I am tired. But  come home and take care of my parents, and take them to appointments or shop for groceries. I am a dutiful daughter.\n\nI came home this morning from my shift, and knew my parents had an appointment, so I showered, changed and got them on the bus. But we weren't going to the doctor,, they said we were going to the university for my older brother. He had joined a new club, and we were going to meet his friends and girlfriend there.\n\nMy brother's real name is Han, but he has changed it to sound more Korean, so now he goes by Cheong-san. I don't care who knows this now. I have a very traditional Chinese name, and my parents have names that could pass for either Korean or Chinese. I promise this is important.\n\nWhen we get to his university we found him and his girlfriend, and some of his friends and I was shocked. He had joined a club known for being pro-Korean, anti-Chinese and anti-reunification. My parents just stood there, greeting everyone and smiling as my brother introduced them, and then me, as their CARETAKER.\n\nI looked at them like they were crazy, adn then told them that I was Han's little sister, and that was his real name. And that he was born in Nanking, as were our parents. If they didn't believe me, to ask for his birth certificate. I told my family I was disgusted with them, and left.\n\nI came home, and noticed all of the \"family\" pictures show only my parents and my brother, All of them. Not a single one has me in them. I smashed the glass on all of them, packed my things and left. I don't have a lot so it only took me an hour. Now I am staying at the hotel I work at (we get free days we can stay, and I have a lot of them saved up) and my things I don't need in a storage unit until I can find a place. I just...how could they do this to me? And be alright with what my brother is doing? The life he is living?\n\nI have been getting calls from my parents and brother, and I am not answering. It felt good to show my brother's friends exactly who he is, but I still feel like I shouldn't have, now my brother 's reputation at university will be ruined.

Yet at the same time giving you tons of obligations.\n\nI never, ever consider someone an AH for stating an uncomfortable truth.  Everything you said was the truth, one he was trying to hide behind a web of lies.  Weird, I thought lying about your family and background would be profoundly shameful and insulting.  I guess it's not to your parents, when Golden Child is involved.\n\nI advise you go permanent no contact (NC) with everyone in your family.  They don't want you to exist to them?  Make it so.

I had to do it with my dad who was very abusive and treated me like the black sheep. But as hard as it was, my god it was so freeing and life has been significantly better. \n\nMove on.

Love it. \n\nLook, I\u2019m not going to address the blatant sexism/favoritism in your family. I could, and I want to to because I hate that sort of thing, but I\u2019m also half-Asian and understand that my westernized opinions on the former aren\u2019t going to be helpful against the backdrop of the significantly more traditional family/environment that you live in. Regardless, your family treats you terribly and I\u2019m really proud of you for standing up for yourself and breaking free. I\u2019m sure it was hard to do, particularly when cultural norms are telling you that filial piety matters more than independence, but you deserve so much more in life than what they\u2019re willing to give you. You\u2019re a hard worker, generous, and caring \u2014 you have more than *earned* their respect and it\u2019s disgraceful that they refuse to even acknowledge you as an important member of the family. \n\nI understand why your brother may have felt the need to hide the fact he\u2019s Chinese considering the widespread anti-Chinese sentiments in Korea. I\u2019m sure he thought it would help him get ahead socially and professionally.

At the end of the day, I suspect you would\u2019ve stuck to his lie if he\u2019d had the decency to treat you as his sister but he treated you like a stranger.
