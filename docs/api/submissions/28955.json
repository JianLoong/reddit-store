My brother is 17, I'm 16 and my sister is 15. Our dad remarried and has has another three kids, our half siblings, with his wife. My half siblings are 9, 7 and 5. My sister and I still split time between mom and dad's houses. But my brother chose to stay with mom full time last year and he doesn't keep in touch with dad. They always had a really rocky relationship and my brother has said more than once he's done with dad. The reason I mention this is because the fallout has been on my sister and me and not on him because he has no contact with our dad. But anyway.\n\nSo a few months ago my sister and I thought it would be cool to buy matching sister bracelets. The idea started with just the two of us but then we talked our brother into accepting one too, though he's only worn it once. We keep them at mom's because our half siblings would be hurt to see them, mostly my 9 year old half sister, and I think my dad's wife would be bothered enough if the bracelets were in their house to give them to my half sisters (the 9 and 5 year old's).\n\nOur cousin got married a few weeks ago and my siblings and I wore the bracelets for the wedding and we took some photos of us wearing them and I posted them to my social media. My brother was rolling his eyes the whole time but he did it lol.\n\nAnyway, dad was looking through the photos and included my half sister in the looking through them and they saw the bracelets and she got upset and wondered why she didn't have one too. The next time my sister and I were at dad's he brought the topic up to us and asked what the hell we were thinking doing sibling mementos and not including all our siblings. My half sister asked if she could have one and I told her I was sorry, but no, because it was just for us older three. Then she got upset because she hasn't seen my brother in a year and the three of us are close like that but not with her.\n\nDad told me we never should have bought the bracelets in the first place. He asked why it was just for three instead of for the six of us and I said because the relationship with our half siblings is different. He said that shouldn't be true and that it just goes to show we're callous and want to stomp on our younger siblings. He said the worst thing was getting the bracelets and knowing our half siblings would want to be included but not including them. He asked how I could look at myself in the mirror. He said similar stuff to my sister.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697363150, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178bynj/aita_for_not_including_my_half_siblings_in/", "score": 618, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Its both normal and appropriate for your relationship with the three siblings you share a mother with, who you had a whole 6-8 years with before you're half siblings birth, will be different than the relationship with your half- siblings. \n\nYour dad can't see that because he doesn't want to - *because seeing it is against his best interests*. He WANTS you and your half siblings to be just as close as your full siblings, because it makes him feel better and it makes parenting easier for him. He's trying to pressure you into what works best for HIM. \n\nYou are not callous, HE is in fact being very immature making out you have no empathy when you are a teenager whose family dynamic went through a huge change (what with your brother not having contact with dad etc, your family life sounds complicated. You're allowed to have complicated feelings about a complicated situation). \n\nHeck, I have only two sisters (same parents), one 2 years older than me, and one 7 years younger, and my relationship with both of them is REALLY different because of the age gap with lil sis. Different doesn't mean bad - but I grew up under different circumstances with my older sister, and we have very similar experiences of our childhood. This is normal. There are no hard feelings. We bond in different ways!\n\nBad news? Your dad is unlikely to change his stance. He's being pig headed and not a very good, understanding or mature parent here. You might see him put unrealistic expectations on you while you live in his house. You might not be able to change his mind, but please - *don't listen to him*. Don't let him convince you you are heartless or mean, stay close to your siblings, be kind to them all but don't be ashamed about different dynamics with your full sibs. \n\nGood luck!", "Well he's lovely. Hard to see why your brother won't give him the time of day. You share an age group with your full siblings so of course the relationship is different! Your father is ridiculous. You weren't selfish for doing a bonding activity with your full siblings. This wasn't done to exclude. You may want to explain it to the 9 year old, but ignore your father's manipulative toxicity. \n\nNTA", "Although I understand your dad's point, NTA. You relationship is going to be different from you half siblings. Not only because you were raised together, in completely different environments and circumstances than they are, but the age gap at this point naturally makes it more difficult to have a close bond. I have teenagers and they're always doing their own things and would be annoyed at much younger kids, because they're teenagers!", "NTA\n\nYou aren't required to purchase a sister bracelet for anyone you don't want to just like you aren't required to buy a friendship bracelet for every friend.", "Can you not have something just for you 3 that's shocking your dad is trying to manipulate you to get what he wants", "NTA. Those 3 can get their own sibling bracelets. You can even give the bracelets to them as a gift. They should be of a different style.", "NTA you father is a real ah.\n\nYou, your sister and Brother have a beautiful Bond and treasure that.", "Nta\n\n\nBut I wonder why your brother won't have anything to do with the dad? Maybe he knows something that would make you all cut contact with the father as well.", "NTA.", "NTA- half siblings that you don\u2019t even live with are no where near as close as full siblings. Ur dad sounds wonderful tho no wonder ur bro as no contact", "NTA for getting the bracelets. \n\nA little bit of one for brushing off your little sister. You missed a chance for bonding with her.  She seems to want to be close with you.  She\u2019s just a kid. Hasn\u2019t done anything wrong.", "I can see why your brother chose to live full time with your mother.\n\nAt the rate your father's going, your brother will soon, I imagine, be joined by you and your sister.\n\nNTA", "NTA!", "NTA in the context of why you bought the bracelets you did.  You and your full brother and sister can have a set and that's fine.\n\nYour dad is wrong in what he said.  It would make much more sense if he bought a full set for the 6 of you and you can have two sets.\n\nI can completely see why the younger sister was upset and she is related by blood to you regardless and it sounds like you have some sort of reasonable relationship with her/them.\n\nThere is a big age gap especially at this age.  You may be closer as you get older.\n\nAll your dad has done is alienate you and your sister further from him and your half siblings with what he has said.", "NTA and it's sad that your father had to make such an issue of it. All he needed to tell your half sister was the bracelets were a gift from your mom to her own children. A tiny white lie that should have satisfied everyone with no hurt feelings. I think I see why your brother is NC with your dad.", "Nta", "NTA, even without the full/half stuff this is just classic age gap sibling stuff in my eyes. My siblings had inside jokes, stuff they did etc that I wasn\u2019t included in because of a 7+ year age gap. Did it sting when they went away to camp together and I was at home? Yes. Did that mean they shouldn\u2019t go together? No!\n\nWhen I felt left out, my parents explained that there were some things that were just for them cause they were older. This included accessories etc that they could pay for with their own wages but weren\u2019t in the family budget. They NEVER would have asked my siblings to not buy clothes or do something because I couldn\u2019t either.\n\nKey memory: we were on holiday, my siblings were going to the trampoline park with some friends one afternoon and I REALLY wanted them to take me. I wanted to go have fun with my brother, sister and their cool pals! But my 18 and 17 year old siblings quite rightly wanted some time to just have fun and not be responsible for their little sister who was occasionally an accidental snitch (I didn\u2019t know things were secrets!). My parents let me know I couldn\u2019t go, that me pushing for it so was not ok, that my brother and sister deserved to have time with their friends, and that they would pay for the three of us to go another time when my siblings were free. I think we maybe did something fun to distract me, but I do remember that it if it was the trampoline park I suggested that I wouldn\u2019t get to do anything ha!\n\nI have great relationships with my brother and sister as an adult. I had said to them separately this summer that I hoped we could do a big joint Christmas sometimes soon, because we haven\u2019t spent it together the 3 of us in 15 years. 2023 has been a tough year for me with my health, and as a surprise my siblings have now organised for us to spend Christmas together this year. Which is just one example of how both of them have shown up for me in different ways again and again over the years, and I do the same for them too.\n\nWhen I was growing up I had different connections with both, my sister was my second mum and my brother was low key my hero. We interacted in the way that worked for each of us, I annoyed them in different ways and I had so much fun with both of them and know they did too. My brother was a 14 year old throwing me Lion King themed tea parties where we just sang the songs together. My sister used to drive me and my pals around when I was 11, with the radio on full blast singing along and I felt like the coolest person ever.\n\nI guess what I\u2019m saying is your dad is being a dick and trying to make this what he wants. Very rarely is \u201cequal\u201d actually fair, what you want is equitable. You don\u2019t have to have the SAME relationship with your half siblings as you do with your full ones, but it sounds like they really want a relationship with their older half siblings and it would be unfair on them to say no because of how your dad is being. So don\u2019t let you dad push you into that being his terms or nothing, do it your way. My family dynamic is weird, but it works for us and I know when push comes to shove my siblings (and now the people they married as well) will show up for me. Don\u2019t let your dad ruin your chance for that and do it on your own terms, with the boundaries you need. Kids under 10 are way more understanding than people think in my experience as long as someone actually talks to them about stuff.", "You know, if it was that big a deal and so important, your Dad could go out and buy sibling bracelets for alllll of you and gift them to you. You could wear the thing once or twice to keep your little half sister happy. And shut her up.\n\nIt\u2019s fine you want bracelets with your full siblings. And you don\u2019t have or even want the same connection with your half siblings. but they are still there, and you are stuck with them. Gatekeeping, \u201cI was sorry, but no, because it was just for us older three\u201d, was unnecessary and a little cold. \n\nThere is no damn reason you can\u2019t have a second, more inclusive bracelet. There doesn\u2019t have to *be* just one bracelet. \n\nAnd now you have drama. \n\nI don\u2019t know or care how expensive or cheap they are. ESH, except your younger half sister.", "YTA. Knowing that your younger half-sister would be hurt by this, you did it and she felt rejected by someone she obviously admires. Yeah I get that you have a different relationship with your brother and sister than you do with the others, but that can be expressed in a way that doesn't crush the feelings of a little kid. She's gonna remember this for a long time, maybe for the rest of her life.", "For me, your dad sucks more. I can't imagine giving my existing young children a step-parent much less half-siblings without taking into consideration how they would take it.  Why? Because if they're not prepared enough and open to that, then not only do I risk everyone being unhappy in case they take it badly, but also I risk my relationship with them. \n\nYour father already had a family, it was his choice and his responsibility. Every choice he makes after that should take his previous responsibilities into consideration. Children are not Lego blocks, you can just push them together and expect them to magically click.  \n\nYou three have just 1 yr age difference between each other ( again your parents' choice)  you pretty much grew up together all the way, of course, you are close... Then I guess your father didn't even consult you before starting a new family and now he's surprised Pikachu it is not going smoothly? Give me a break.  \n\nNo honestly since it is what it is, and you already have this half/step part of the family, it was pretty lame of you to do this if you yourself admit you knew it would hurt the kids. You are 16yo, you're not exactly a child anymore so you should be more mature about things and if you want to do something between you three only, and are unwilling to do a similar thing with all of you, then at least don't flunk it on the SM ? \n\nAnyways ESH 4/10 AH for your dad and 1/10 AH for you three.", "YTA. There is nothing meaner than a sixteen year old girl.", "Soft YTA. I understand that you wanted to do something with just the 3 of you, but being so caught up in bracelets is immature. \n\nI don\u2019t agree that your dad should have brought your sister into it, but he is right in the sense that it\u2019s even worse that you knew they would be upset and did it anyway. They\u2019re all under 10. They don\u2019t understand the complexities of relationships and biology yet. By doing what you\u2019ve done, you really only hurt them. \n\nYou went as far as to keep them at your mom\u2019s to avoid issue and yet you chose to wear them to an event all together. You should\u2019ve kept them at your mom\u2019s, period. \n\nYou could have easily bought 4 more bracelets that were different for you and your half siblings to keep the peace. \n\nI\u2019m going with soft YTA because I don\u2019t think you were malicious, but you did hurt your other siblings that are young and don\u2019t understand.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
