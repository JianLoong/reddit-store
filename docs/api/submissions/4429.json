When  Austin and James lived together, James would do things like clog up toilets (using paper towels when he ran out of tp) and just let it sit for months without fixing it, use hair/toothbrushes that didn\u2019t belong to him, get into car accidents (one of them being in Austin\u2019s car, and a second time got Austin\u2019s car towed.) While I like James, everyone in our circle acknowledges he\u2019s a bit immature and unhygienic.\n\nSo recently, I bought my first car. Austin helped me a bit financially with it, and for all intents and purposes it is a shared car between us. But all of it is in my name. This car is so new, I havent even gotten the license plates yet. So I now have a car, (Austin also has a stick shift Mustang that I dont know how to drive) a 2021 Lexus.\n\nSo recently, I went out of town for a weekend. When I got back, Austin had mentioned his Mustang was at James\u2019 place and we would have to go get it\u2026 It was random and I didn\u2019t understand how he had gotten back home without his car. I asked about it but Austin beat around the bush and didn\u2019t really tell me how.\n\nA week goes by, and after some pushing, I found out through a series of questions that at some point, his friend James drove my car.  The brand new car I had just got. I was pissed beyond belief. \n\nI got mad at Austin because he didn\u2019t tell me and basically lied by omission. I tried to set a boundary and tell him that no one else can drive the new car except for me and Austin unless we make a decision together or I\u2019m at least given a heads up. I was also pissed because he let James drive it, who is just naturally irresponsible and destructive with things. So I told him I didn\u2019t want James driving our car again either.\n\nAustin said I\u2019m an asshole and it\u2019s his car too and he should be able to let anyone drive without having to tell me. He told me I was being possessive of the car and that it\u2019s not just mine. I tried to explain that I was upset because if James got in an accident, it would be on my insurance and on my record\u2026 I already pay a high insurance and car note because it\u2019s my first car ever. But Austin wouldnt listen and has called me a bad partner for getting upset.\n\ntldr; reckless friend drove the car i just got and my boyfriend didnt tell me.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEDIT:: I didn\u2019t realize this was important to include, but I am paying for the monthly payments, the insurance on it, and the gas. Everything is in my name. Also, I can afford a Lexus, people \ud83d\ude02 I was waiting on some investments to close but the Lexus deal was too good to pass up. So I have every intention of paying Austin back within the next month. Additionally, he contributed 10% of down payment.\n\n2ND EDIT:: I\u2019m not going to break up with Austin over this. It\u2019s one of the very few arguments we have had. After a very long day of discussing this, he now understands where I am coming from. \n\nThank you for all the advice and help!", "created_utc": 1670699147, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zi0jzu/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_that_his_friend/", "score": 126, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why would he help pay and own it, especially when he already has his own car?
