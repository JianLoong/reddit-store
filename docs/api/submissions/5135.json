Your ex is a creep, and him going around telling people that he finds you attractive is highly inappropriate. You need to show him the door, and your BF should reconsider being friends with someone that thinks it\u2019s ok to show up to your house and start telling people that he wants to be with you.

You could have easily told him off in front of everyone (i wouldve done that cause i have no self control), but you confided in your best friend and changed into something that made you feel more safe in an unsafe situation.

Your ex is, though, and your partner to a lesser extent for not standing up for you better. Everyone who cares about you should have probably formed a circle around you and told the guy to get lost after he had dropped your daughter off. Obviously, you need to minimize contact with your ex and make clear to your partner that you need their cooperation in this.", "NTA. Your ex was completely out of line and gross. He can think whatever he wants but he needs to keep that to himself. I wouldn't have changed clothes because F-him", "NTA, he should be super embarrassed to have said that at all, especially to your CURRENT partner. He thinks bc they\u2019re friends he can talk about you that way, even w your history?? No. You had every right to change if his comments made you uncomfortable, and it\u2019s super controlling on his part to then say YOU\u2019RE the one calling attention to his behavior.", "NTA, HE drew that attention telling people about it. Very weird he got to stay after saying it to your partner.", ">my ex-husband pulled me to the side and called me an asshole for changing because it drew too much attention to what he said.\n\n\"If you're embarrassed, try *not saying it* next time\"\n\nNTA", "\ud83d\ude44", "That's why I left it be because it was his week with her and i didn't want her to leavs", "NTA.  Your ex was totally inappropriate here - clearly the AH.  After his comments, I hope you and hubby never socialize with him again.  Keep that relationship strictly business (or your daughter).\n\nIf he's concerned about how he look for the comments he made, then that's on him.  He should be embarrassed.", "NTA, but I don't think you needed to do all that.  It does draw attention to yourself, but your partner should have asked him to leave", "NTA \n\nMaybe he shouldn't go making creepy comments.", "NTA. And WHAT THE HELL?  He shouldn\u2019t have said anything at all.", "NTA. Ex should have kept comments to himself especially since you had your current partner right there and he had audacity say that to him. I would not have gone so far to change your clothes but I'd probably not invite him to these events again or just ignore him", "NTA. It's not weird he still finds you attractive, it's weird he's telling multiple people that.", "NTA - but you need to stop inviting your ex to events. I understand you share a daughter together, but his behavior is creepy and innapropriate, and clearly, this co-parenting relationship needs a MAJOR boundary overhaul. I don't know anything about custody, but I'm wondering if this type of harassing behavior could be grounds to reevaluate your custody agreement?", "NTA. Why was he not asked to leave?", "NTA\n\nif he didn't want attention, he shouldn't have said it. The fact that he found it necessary to say it to your partner is more than disturbing. And you just know that if you hadn't changed, he would've said you were \"teasing him\". I really think you two need to keep him at arm's length.", "NTA. Why did no one tell him to GTFO??", "NTA but I find that response a bit strange, it didn't really solve the issue and it probably brought more attention to the whole situation. I think the more grownup thing would have been asking him to leave, or bringing it up with him after the party or something.", "I gotta just point out how asinine it is for this guy to have to thoughtvomit this onto other people. \n\nOh really? You find your ex attractive? The same person you made a human child with? How _unusual_!!! \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 Fuck's sake of course he thinks you're attractive. Who needs to know about it?\n\nIt sounds like he needs to be banned from future social events because he can't stop himself from trying to stir up drama \n\nNTA", "All of this and it's no wonder you divorced his gross and creepy ass. \nI get that people can be friends with an ex and even their new partner being friends but your ex is just inappropriate.", "Yes, both to good job current and our low standards here.", "He didn't want to ask him to leave because it was his week with our daughter and he would've taken her with him. So i \"suffered it out\" so i could spend time with her", "Right? These people sound 13.", "Because it was his week with my child and wanted to spend that time with her. So i just dealt with it.", "Because it was his week with my daughter and i didn't want her to leave.", "Got it..  Makes sense", "I respect that but he proved he was incapable of acting appropriately in your home with your guests. There has to be a line."]}
