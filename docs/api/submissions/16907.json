It was hard for my kids (26M, 24F Jane) and me, but my daughter was devastated. Jane and my wife were extremely close and she's been in therapy for many years at this point. I never thought I'd date again and did my best to be supportive and give both of them enough love to fill the void left by my wife. It was tough and very trying at times but I'm proud of the people my kids have become.\n\nLast year I was taking an oil painting class and met a woman, Lacy (42F). She's the first person I've had feelings for since my wife died. She had divorced her husband a year prior so we were both taking it slow. I waited a couple of months before telling my kids I was seeing her. My son was happy for me and told me he was glad I found someone. Jane, however, was rather cold and distant when I told her. I asked what was wrong and she said nothing was wrong. Lacy and my son get along quite well, but Jane has only been cold and passive aggressive towards her. Lacy has tried her best to be kind and hasn't pushed to be in Jane's life, but Jane's attitude hasn't changed. Jane always makes rude comments about Lacy whenever I see her at this point, regardless f whether Lacy is there. Every time I ask her what her problem with Lacy is she just deflects and pushing the question just makes her more angry and defensive.\n\nThis came to a head last weekend. We had a family gathering to celebrate my mother's 82nd birthday. Jane asked why Lacy was there at all and I told her that Lacy is important to me and she gets along really well with grandma (as a side note the two get along really well since they're both into knitting and arts and crafts). Jane stormed off. I was talking with my son and nephew while Lacy and my mom were talking. Lacy got up to go get a drink, but when she came back she was almost in tears and told me she wasn't feeling well. I pulled her aside and asked what happened and apparently Jane had said some very harsh things to Lacy and stopped short of outright calling her a gold digger. We went home after that.\n\nThe next day I called Jane over and Lacy went to the spa. I told Jane that she doesn't have to treat Lacy like her mom but she has to at the very least be civil. She told me I was replacing her mom and that she hated that I was trying to forget her mom. I told her I still visit her mom's grave twice a month and that was completely unfair of her to say. I asked her if she wanted me to be alone for the rest of my life, and she said she'd prefer that over me dating a woman who only likes me for my money. I told Jane that and said either she acts civil with Lacy or I will no longer being giving her money every month. She called me an ass and left. My son called me later and said that I wasn't being fair and it's just taking a while for Jane to accept me moving on.  I'm not sure what I should do at this point, I understand Jane is hurting but I can't stand seeing her take it out on Lacy. AITA?\n\nEdit: I couldn't fit it in the character limit, but I've seen some comments asking. Jane is in her junior year of college, and I'm paying for her so she can focus on her studies. I encouraged both my kids to take time before deciding what their plan was and my daughter tried some different fields to figure out what she wanted to study.", "created_utc": 1683737098, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13dw9lg/aita_for_threatening_to_cut_off_support_to_my/", "score": 850, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Therapy is not working. Your daughter has no right to tell you. she'd rather you alone and unhappy. Time to move on. Maybe if she was not getting money from you, she'd grow up and move on as well. Don't get guilted into not living life.", "NTA \u2026 not even in the vicinity. Frankly if Jane continues to act like a 3 yo I would cut off her money. She\u2019s 24 and old enough to earn her own living.", "NTA. I guess Jane, an adult, is worried that Lacy will somehow be cutting into her monthly support.\n\nedited to fix Lacy's name", "NTA. Her grief is allowed to be different than yours but she has absolutely no right to punish you or Lacy for your life moving forward. You are allowed to love someone again.", "NTA. But be careful. I wont try to understand the trauma of losing a mother that young. However, at 24, and presumably 11 odd years of therapy, your daughter should be more rounded, and at the very least, respectful to your choices and partner, its just good manners. I dont think threats are good though, its a counter productive method for a damaging outcome. You have raised to kids alone, after a death, YOU are allowed happiness, and perhaps you could get your 24yo to stand on her own two feet.", "NTA. You are correct about one thing - your daughter doesn\u2019t have to like your GF, but she can be civil, and cat at least stop making unfounded accusations. It\u2019s been over a decade since your wife died - no one can accuse you of jumping into dating too fast. \n\nAnd your daughter has come across one truth of the world: where there is support there is control. It\u2019s not nice or pretty, but it\u2019s true. And you\u2019ve been supporting your daughter. And it\u2019s not like being civil is a big ask. However, it doesn\u2019t sound like her therapy is helping much.", "NTA but I'm not sure cutting her off is going to get the result you want, unless the result you want is Jane being out of your life.", "NTA. Jane in a grown woman, she needs to act like it.", "NTA - Jane is an adult, it's time she started acting like one.  Why are you still giving her money each month?", "NTA. I could debate whether going to the \u201cstick\u201d with Jane is the right move, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for doing so. It is not unreasonable for your daughter to be struggling with her emotions around losing her mother even after 11 years and you having a new SO in your life, but asking for a bare minimum level of civility toward Lacy is entirely fair.\n\nMaybe offer to go to some joint therapy or counseling with Jane, though, before actually implementing the stick\u2026 see if you can work out the issues in a safe environment and maybe her some help to work through her feelings.", "NTA - your daughter is being extremely immature and selfish. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why you are sending a 24 year old money every month, but if she can\u2019t be disrespectful to you and the important people in your life and expect there to be no consequences.", "Jane is a grown woman that\u2019s been in therapy ever since her mom died 11 yrs ago clearly it\u2019s not working Jane is acting like a spoiled little child if you cut her off financially you would NTA she\u2019s your gf a gold digger but she\u2019s the only one in the post that\u2019s getting money lol", "I have to say NTA. it's been 11 years, you are entitled to move on. Jane doesn't get to say you can't have someone in her life, and is being incredibly selfish. She is old enough to support herself, if she doesn't like people sponging your money she needs to start looking at home.", "NTA If your daughter was a still a child then I'd say you were being too harsh, but Jane is a grown adult and there are consequences for her actions. I do find it funny how she accused Lacy of being a gold digger who's only interested in your money, but then she got upset when you threatened to cut off her monthly allowance, pot meet kettle.\n\nI'm very sorry for the loss of your wife OP, losing a loved one is never easy. I hope you and Lacy have a wonderful time together, even without your daughters blessing.", "You are entitled to a life too, it\u2019s not like you just lost your wife and moved in a new partner within a month.

I'll admit when I was in my early teens I struggled with the idea of my dad being with another woman (although they were divorced when she died) but as I became an adult I wanted my dad to love again. I hated seeing him lonely. He never dated again (not seriously enough to introduce to me anyway) and he died in 2018. I wish he could've loved again. You raised your daughter for a huge part, alone, and you deserve to be happy. She is 24 not a child, she should have the empathy to want her dad to be happy. And I think you would be completely within your rights to cut her off. But tell her that is your plan first. She should be able to support herself by now. Especially if she wants to behave like she is. She's behaving like an angry 8 year old.", "NTA. Your daughter doesn't have to get over the fact her mom died but she does have to get over the fact that you have a girlfriend. She does not get to dictate your life. \n\nSounds like she's upset that she is now having to share your money.", "I'm gonna say NTA. Jane is 24, she doesn't need her dad to be giving her money every month - it is a nice thing for you to do though. I think Jane should continue in therapy because she definitely seems to not have fully processed losing her mother.", "NTA. It is not too much to ask your daughter to be civil to Lacy. After 11 years you are more than entitled to find someone new. Your daughter is not treating you with respect either!\n\nCut her off until she starts to behave like a loving daughter who wants you to be happy. And calling your father an ass in never acceptable.", "NTA\n\nI wonder why Jane thinks Lacy is a gold digger?  Has Lacy moved in with you?  Have you purchased expensive  or luxury items for Lacy?   Does Lacy have children, and Jane is worried that you will spend significant amount of money on those children?", "You're NTA at all, but you are responsible for the status quo. Your daughter may become a mother in the future. How you play the current hand dealt to you might be reflected in the type of relationship you have with your future grandchildren.", "NTA.  It is completely unreasonable for your adult daughter to attempt to deny you from having a relationship after so many years.  Most people who lose their partners don\u2019t get into another relationship in hopes of replacing their lost loved one.  Your daughter\u2019s problems seem to be far deeper than losing her mother.  Go and live your life and be happy.", "NTA - You made sure that your kids had the time, space, and tools to handle the grief of losing their mother. \n\nOne has processed one way and seems to be doing well.\n\nThe other seems to have been somewhat emotionally stunted by the ordeal which is common with big traumas especially ones that occur at important times in our childhood development.\n\nGiven the fact that your daughter has been in therapy all this time and is reacting to this much like a child (the age she was when her mom died) it may be time to look for more helpful ways for her to cope.\n\nThere\u2019s seems to be no reason to think that your GF is a gold digger but there is reason to be concerned with your daughters behavior. You", "So I have questions and don\u2019t see where you\u2019ve mentioned it. Why does she think your gf is a gold digger? Have you two sat down and spoke about why she feels this way? I\u2019m not saying her behavior Is ok I\u2019m just curious why. The both of you being over emotional is understood but not helpful. I\u2019d talk to her explain you\u2019re happy but if she doesn\u2019t have anything concrete she needs to table it for now and you\u2019ll be aware. I\u2019m not so sure this is about her moms death. I think this is about you. She\u2019s going to have to share you with someone new and is not doing well. Id keep the promises you made but tell her you\u2019ll be inviting gf to events as you have that right but if she can\u2019t be civil that day she has the right to not attend. You can see her at different times away from gf. I\u2019d not force them together. Explain you want them both just to be able to be in the same room peacefully not that\u2019s she\u2019s to replace her mom or take her space from you.", "Why does she insist Lacy is a gold digger? Are you well off and supporting her financially?", "I don\u2019t think cutting off money for college would be a good idea. I think it will create a division that might not be mended, and since your daughter has thrown down the gold digger card, it would only be you keeping the money for you and your gf. If you threaten with money, i would hold it over if she refused to go to therapy. You may have already lost your daughter, so i would focus on her mental health. \nIf you do talk to her, I would ask her what she is not getting from you since you have dated your gf.  She may not have an answer and may force her to think. She may have an answer that would surprise you and maybe something you can work on together.", "NSH, all you\u2019re asking is for Jane to be civil with your girlfriend, but she isn\u2019t and is pretty cold towards her, which I kind of understand, she isn\u2019t over the death of her mom yet, and is still grieving for her, i\u2019m not saying that you should break up with your girlfriend absolutely not, you have the right to love anybody you want, I think what you said was justified, as for Lucy, she sounds like a caring and kind person, as of right now I see no bad guys here so I would say, give your daughter some time to adjust being with Lucy, the death of a loved, one is never easy, no matter how much time has passed", "NTA\n\n\nDo not, however, stop paying for her education and other utilities that you might be paying for. her accusations are centered on Lacy's alleged gold diggery--accusations that I suspect are trauma-born bullshit, but take that with a grain of salt because I clearly do not know details about the situation--and are rooted in finances and she will merely take your removal of financial support as proof of her suspicions. do not put Lacy in that position.\n\n\nJane is demanding empathy of you and everyone else while displaying a severe lack of empathy for both you and Lacy, which is repugnant. what I'm about to suggest will ruffle some feathers but I do not care because she is an adult woman and has had over a decade to address her grief and she has not done the work, period. so, you need to galvanize the entire family, immediate and extended. they all *need* to be aware of what your *adult* daughter is doing and saying to your girlfriend. not to chastise or alienate her but to protect Lacy. they need to know Jane's tendency to hurt Lacy and they need to help you in shutting that behavior down, not just for Lacy's sake but for Jane's as well. you cannot do this alone. everyone needs to band together to keep this things civil in family gatherings and if that means never letting Lacy be alone with Jane during these times, then so be it. don't give her any opportunities to spew her hateful vitriol. as for more intimate settings with just immediate family--dinners, movie nights, whatever--Jane does not need to be present. I don't care how harsh that sounds. remove family bonding from the situation because Jane has clearly shown that she does not want to be a part of the family you're creating. you can take her to lunch or hang out with her one-on-one outside of the home but until she can unearth the decency to treat an innocent woman who loves you with the dignity she is owed, you do not owe her lovey dovey family unit time. \n\n\nI have had similar issues with my father and I understand the tendency to want to behave poorly, I truly do. but I am also a grown woman and the level of cruelty Jane is displaying is vile. Regardless of my personal feelings, I would never have spoken to my father or anyone who purported to love him the way she has to Lacy. I am so sorry that you have to deal with this and my heart breaks for Jane, it truly does. but she cannot conduct herself the way she is, demanding your loneliness and terrorizing your partners, as she is *an adult woman* that needs to get her shit together. I hope that you can recognize that everything I have said is said with love and compassion and I wish the best for your family. even if you and Lacy do not remain together, I want everyone to feel safe and loved but most importantly, *respected*. God bless \u2665\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nBut I wouldn't cut off her college support. Tell her that she doesn't have to interact with Lacy, but that she can't keep acting like a child and lashing out at her. She doesn't have to like her, but she does have to recognize that Lacy makes you happy.", "NTA - your daughter needs some therapy to help work through this. I don\u2019t know why at 24 she is still receiving your financial support but maybe you tell her she can earn it back if she gets therapy to help sort through the trauma she has over you carrying on with your life 11 years later. She is being completely unfair and cannot see that her behavior is wrong.", "ESH. Jane's behavior is completely unacceptable but cutting her off financially as a retaliation isn't right, either. If you made an agreement with her, to underwrite her education, you should stick to it. I'd put a time limit on it, though.\n\nOn the other hand, her cruelty to you is breathtaking. I would refuse to associate with her or, at least, publicly reprimand her whenever she was rude to my friend; act like a child, get treated like a child.", "My but your daughter is a walking red flag.

Your daughter isn't abusing the financial benefits, she's abusing your gf (and you). Punishing her emotions via finances is just lazy.

What if you did something along the lines of:\n\n1. You will pay for one more year of college, but she also needs to attend counseling, possibly family counseling.\n2. I'm not sure what else you were financially supporting (room, board, car, cell, etc.) You might include funding some of those things in the same agreement above (e.g., pay for her rent for one more year, on condition of attending counseling). I can think of other variations - pay for some on condition of being civil, pay for some for 6 months (then reassessing)... In the end, I think it makes most sense to discuss this with a family counselor because you don't want to do a measure that basically undoes what you hope to achieve through counseling.\n3. Of course, the challenge is - if your daughter refuses to attend counseling, you might then have to see her unable to afford college and unable to get a living wage without a degree. Again, a family counselor might help you think all this through.\n\n* The bottom line is - I would get some professional guidance and look for an approach that holds her accountable and sets your boundaries clearly, but still gives her the tools she needs to (1) deal with her emotional fallout and (2) choose to stay on track with completing her education.\n* Please know that Lacy sounds like a wonderful woman.

I do not need your permission to be happy. I will always love your mum, but you need to understand that you can love more than one person. I did not leave your mother. She died. My love for her didn't. I have had 11 years of no relationship. But I am a human being who has thoughts, feelings, and needs. Understand that whilst you were a teenager with mums loss. I have done everything in my power to support you into adulthood. Let you grow and learn to be you. I have to ask honestly. Do you feel like I am really replacing your mother? Or are you afraid you will lose me? I have done nothing that would indicate the former. I realize as your surviving parent that you may be frightened about the thought of another person being in my life. You are not losing me. You are gaining an extra person who would love and support you if you gave her a chance. I really do acknowledge  you feelings. But you are massively overstepping on mine. You are not a teenager anymore, but an adult. Whilst I love you dearly, I will need to put in some boundaries for us to grow through this transitioning time..\n\n2) you do not get to bad mouth a person I care for, and expect money off me at the same time. I will not reward spiteful behaviour. \n\n3) You do not have to like whom I chose to have a relationship with. However , if you wish to continue support from me, my boundary is that you are civil and act respectfully around them. You will decide the  consequences to your actions. This is a courtesy,  that you understand your choices going forward, have your own results. \n\n4) as in point 3. If you continue to be abusive to my partner,  you are very welcome to financially your own educational choices. My finance are not your business. You know nothing of lacy's either. \n\n6) You will not be invited to events, if this behaviour is seen again.   What you pulled demonstrated cruelty and emotional immaturity. You lashed out like an angry teenager. You are an adult.Lacy has not done anything wrong. You, however, have been wilful in your intent to act like an entitled child. This stops now. You are demanding respect for your feelings, whilst stamping over ours. \n\n7) Your college will have a therapist. You are showing  a lot of unregulated emotions, and you're using lacy as the target.  I feel there is still unresolved trauma from the death of your mum. Respectfully consider  getting councilling, please. This is not healthy for you and very destructive from a family viewpoint. \n\n9) Everyone else in our family has accepted Lacy and has a good relationship with her. She has been nothing but patient and respectful to you. We are middle-aged adults. What we do is not your business.  What you are doing is unfortunately making it our business. \n\n10) I have sent this in the hopes that this helps us grow and resolve any underlying issues, and help us become a closer family. Take time to process this, and if you go to councilling, please show this to them.i would be happy to attend joint sessions. \"", "NAH. You\u2019re a father and widower who\u2019s raised his kids to adulthood MashaAllah. Your daughter is struggling with you moving on. Have an honest heart to heart talk with your daughter and maybe advise therapy so that a professional can help her work through these difficult emotional entanglements.", "YTA. You\u2019re 54, your sugar baby is in college. That\u2019s gross. Maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s grossing your daughter out. Is Lacy younger than your daughter?  That would gross her out. Also, young women are not interested in old guys unless said old guy has money.", "YTA\n\nObviously it\u2019s your right to move on but your daughter, no matter how much therapy she has, will never get over the death of her mother. She would be the same if you had been the one to die and her mum started dating someone 12yrs younger. \n\nBeing petty and stopping supporting her through her education is spiteful. She must have hit a nerve by saying this woman is only interested in you for your money and are now holding her future to ransom. Which is made even worse by the fact her mother is gone and can\u2019t step in to support her. \n\nIm assuming when your wife died she left you everything in her will because she thought you\u2019d do the right thing by your children. You must have spoken about supporting them through education when she was alive. I imagine you\u2019ve broken your promise to your late wife.", "just taking a while for Jane to accept me moving on, 11yrs is more than enough time  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThere really shouldn't need to be some kind of grace period for Jane, because it has been **eleven years** since your late wife passed, and it's ridiculous to expect you to remain single forever just to satiate her sense of your widowerhood as some kind of edifice to \"true love\" or some overly sappy shit. You loved your wife, you haven't \"erased her,\" you're just finally moving on because you met someone you click with.\n\nIf anything, a lot of what Jane has been saying about Lacy stinks of that kind of, \"throw shit at the wall and see what sticks\" approach when someone isn't capable of processing their issue. Jane probably doesn't actually mean any of what she's saying in true form, she's just being hurtful and saying whatever to get under your skin, which for a twenty-four year old is ludicrously petty and shows a deep lack of self-reflection.\n\nLike, you've described nothing about your actions or Lacy's that fit the description Jane gave. Lacy hasn't, for instance, pushed to marry quickly or leans on you for money, and you've done nothing to suggest you're erasing their mother. It makes the accusations sound thoroughly fabricated.\n\nNow, I'll admit the financial yank of the leash isn't the best look, but to be perfectly honest what are you supposed to do? You've already said pro-social actions like talking it out don't work, because she acts irrational and erratic when questioned. You can't discuss things with someone who has so completely decided to dig their heels in and scream until their wishes are met. Therapy might be a good angle, but that only works for those who willingly seek it, and I place high odds she'll declare there's nothing wrong with her, and then throw some nonsense about how your wife would be ashamed of you or some other hollow bit out of a movie.\n\nSo, we come back to the one thing you can offer and rescind that she's relying on, the place where you have pull that at least has the potential to muzzle her, even if it torpedos your relationship with her because she's so intent on being awful.\n\nIs it the best choice? No, but your daughter is rapidly leaving you few options for peaceful reconciliation, because it sounds like she'll only accept her way or the highway.", "Jane is a grown woman acting like a little kid because in your efforts to be a good father you kept her as a little girl with little responsabilities to her name. Cut off the suply.\n\nNTA", "Nta. But jane sureis. Her therapy for years obviously isnt working that well since she hasnt even been able to let go just a touch. Or accept that you are a human being with feelings and emotions, that has wants and needs. \n\nShe might need a new therapist. This behaviour is a bit unhinged for someone as old as her.", "Who paid for Lacey to go to the spa ?! Daughter may have a point", "NTA", "NTA. Jane is acting like a spoilt brat. She doesn't have to like Lacy but she needs to be civil for your sake. She's also allowed to have feelings about you moving on and how it plays with her grief but she needs to manage them appropriately.", "NTA at all. It\u2019s been 11 years. You were single for far longer than the normal grieving time. Your daughter is unreasonable. She\u2019s also not doing her deceased mother any favors by basically acting like your late wife would want you to be unhappy for the rest of your life.", "NTA- Jane needs to grow up.", "It's been 11 years. From what I've seen on this sub that already is a lifetime before you started dating again. She's 24, she needs to act her age. NTA", "A year is more than enough time to come to family events and to get close to her BFs mother. WTF? I had gone to family events with my then-boyfriend after a few months. I married him in less than a year. \ud83e\udd23", "I think perhaps OP would benefit from going to a joint session with Jane where they discuss his relationship and see if a resolution can be had before he cuts her off.", "He says she\u2019s been in therapy for years. Doesn\u2019t seem to be making much progress.", "Yeah, this is the thing for me.\n\nIt's not like the OP went with the money from the start. He tried to talk about it with her, but she was evasive and then aggressive when pressed. Now she's made it blatantly clear that what OP saw wasn't just his imagination, and she's again being a jerk about it.\n\nIt sounds to me like each stage was OP giving her a chance to make nice, or space to discuss her issue, and she chooses to double down. Actions do have consequences.", "Exactly. She might open up to a therapist. And op should also give her space and only expect her to be civil and not to bond with his gf, if that's what the daughter wishes. Maybe, she is scared that op will slowly want more from her against her wishes and this would change her way of grieving which she doesn't want to change. \n\nThere could be multiple reasons here and if op really want to continue a good relationship with his daughter, then seeking a therapist for a joint session should be the first step. Not any ultimatums.", "But how do you treat her?", "No she definitely needs to grow up and realise her dad is a person aswell. Shes allowed to have feelings about this but she shouldnt be treating the gf like a gold digging ho", "Yeah you're absolutely right but I do think the daughter should grow up what is she think he was never going to want to make love to a woman ever again", "You say you met in art class last year, did you start dating straightaway?\n\nWhen did the kids meet Lacy?\n\nHow long have you been living together?"]}
