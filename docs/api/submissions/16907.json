It was hard for my kids (26M, 24F Jane) and me, but my daughter was devastated. Jane and my wife were extremely close and she's been in therapy for many years at this point. I never thought I'd date again and did my best to be supportive and give both of them enough love to fill the void left by my wife. It was tough and very trying at times but I'm proud of the people my kids have become.\n\nLast year I was taking an oil painting class and met a woman, Lacy (42F). She's the first person I've had feelings for since my wife died. She had divorced her husband a year prior so we were both taking it slow. I waited a couple of months before telling my kids I was seeing her. My son was happy for me and told me he was glad I found someone. Jane, however, was rather cold and distant when I told her. I asked what was wrong and she said nothing was wrong. Lacy and my son get along quite well, but Jane has only been cold and passive aggressive towards her. Lacy has tried her best to be kind and hasn't pushed to be in Jane's life, but Jane's attitude hasn't changed. Jane always makes rude comments about Lacy whenever I see her at this point, regardless f whether Lacy is there. Every time I ask her what her problem with Lacy is she just deflects and pushing the question just makes her more angry and defensive.\n\nThis came to a head last weekend. We had a family gathering to celebrate my mother's 82nd birthday. Jane asked why Lacy was there at all and I told her that Lacy is important to me and she gets along really well with grandma (as a side note the two get along really well since they're both into knitting and arts and crafts). Jane stormed off. I was talking with my son and nephew while Lacy and my mom were talking. Lacy got up to go get a drink, but when she came back she was almost in tears and told me she wasn't feeling well. I pulled her aside and asked what happened and apparently Jane had said some very harsh things to Lacy and stopped short of outright calling her a gold digger. We went home after that.\n\nThe next day I called Jane over and Lacy went to the spa. I told Jane that she doesn't have to treat Lacy like her mom but she has to at the very least be civil. She told me I was replacing her mom and that she hated that I was trying to forget her mom. I told her I still visit her mom's grave twice a month and that was completely unfair of her to say. I asked her if she wanted me to be alone for the rest of my life, and she said she'd prefer that over me dating a woman who only likes me for my money. I told Jane that and said either she acts civil with Lacy or I will no longer being giving her money every month. She called me an ass and left. My son called me later and said that I wasn't being fair and it's just taking a while for Jane to accept me moving on.  I'm not sure what I should do at this point, I understand Jane is hurting but I can't stand seeing her take it out on Lacy. AITA?\n\nEdit: I couldn't fit it in the character limit, but I've seen some comments asking. Jane is in her junior year of college, and I'm paying for her so she can focus on her studies. I encouraged both my kids to take time before deciding what their plan was and my daughter tried some different fields to figure out what she wanted to study.", "created_utc": 1683737098, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13dw9lg/aita_for_threatening_to_cut_off_support_to_my/", "score": 101, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Therapy is not working. Your daughter has no right to tell you. she'd rather you alone and unhappy. Time to move on. Maybe if she was not getting money from you, she'd grow up and move on as well. Don't get guilted into not living life.", "NTA \u2026 not even in the vicinity. Frankly if Jane continues to act like a 3 yo I would cut off her money. She\u2019s 24 and old enough to earn her own living.", "NTA. I guess Jane, an adult, is worried that Lacy will somehow be cutting into her monthly support.\n\nedited to fix Lacy's name", "NTA. Her grief is allowed to be different than yours but she has absolutely no right to punish you or Lacy for your life moving forward. You are allowed to love someone again.", "NTA. But be careful. I wont try to understand the trauma of losing a mother that young. However, at 24, and presumably 11 odd years of therapy, your daughter should be more rounded, and at the very least, respectful to your choices and partner, its just good manners. I dont think threats are good though, its a counter productive method for a damaging outcome. You have raised to kids alone, after a death, YOU are allowed happiness, and perhaps you could get your 24yo to stand on her own two feet.", "NTA. You are correct about one thing - your daughter doesn\u2019t have to like your GF, but she can be civil, and cat at least stop making unfounded accusations. It\u2019s been over a decade since your wife died - no one can accuse you of jumping into dating too fast. \n\nAnd your daughter has come across one truth of the world: where there is support there is control. It\u2019s not nice or pretty, but it\u2019s true. And you\u2019ve been supporting your daughter. And it\u2019s not like being civil is a big ask. However, it doesn\u2019t sound like her therapy is helping much.", "NTA but I'm not sure cutting her off is going to get the result you want, unless the result you want is Jane being out of your life.", "NTA. Jane in a grown woman, she needs to act like it.", "NTA - Jane is an adult, it's time she started acting like one.  Why are you still giving her money each month?", "NTA. I could debate whether going to the \u201cstick\u201d with Jane is the right move, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for doing so. It is not unreasonable for your daughter to be struggling with her emotions around losing her mother even after 11 years and you having a new SO in your life, but asking for a bare minimum level of civility toward Lacy is entirely fair.\n\nMaybe offer to go to some joint therapy or counseling with Jane, though, before actually implementing the stick\u2026 see if you can work out the issues in a safe environment and maybe her some help to work through her feelings.", "NTA - your daughter is being extremely immature and selfish. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why you are sending a 24 year old money every month, but if she can\u2019t be disrespectful to you and the important people in your life and expect there to be no consequences.", "Jane is a grown woman that\u2019s been in therapy ever since her mom died 11 yrs ago clearly it\u2019s not working Jane is acting like a spoiled little child if you cut her off financially you would NTA she\u2019s your gf a gold digger but she\u2019s the only one in the post that\u2019s getting money lol", "I have to say NTA. it's been 11 years, you are entitled to move on. Jane doesn't get to say you can't have someone in her life, and is being incredibly selfish. She is old enough to support herself, if she doesn't like people sponging your money she needs to start looking at home.", "NTA If your daughter was a still a child then I'd say you were being too harsh, but Jane is a grown adult and there are consequences for her actions. I do find it funny how she accused Lacy of being a gold digger who's only interested in your money, but then she got upset when you threatened to cut off her monthly allowance, pot meet kettle.\n\nI'm very sorry for the loss of your wife OP, losing a loved one is never easy. I hope you and Lacy have a wonderful time together, even without your daughters blessing.", "You are entitled to a life too, it\u2019s not like you just lost your wife and moved in a new partner within a month.

I'll admit when I was in my early teens I struggled with the idea of my dad being with another woman (although they were divorced when she died) but as I became an adult I wanted my dad to love again. I hated seeing him lonely. He never dated again (not seriously enough to introduce to me anyway) and he died in 2018. I wish he could've loved again. You raised your daughter for a huge part, alone, and you deserve to be happy. She is 24 not a child, she should have the empathy to want her dad to be happy. And I think you would be completely within your rights to cut her off. But tell her that is your plan first. She should be able to support herself by now. Especially if she wants to behave like she is. She's behaving like an angry 8 year old.", "NTA. Your daughter doesn't have to get over the fact her mom died but she does have to get over the fact that you have a girlfriend. She does not get to dictate your life. \n\nSounds like she's upset that she is now having to share your money.", "I'm gonna say NTA. Jane is 24, she doesn't need her dad to be giving her money every month - it is a nice thing for you to do though. I think Jane should continue in therapy because she definitely seems to not have fully processed losing her mother.", "NTA. It is not too much to ask your daughter to be civil to Lacy. After 11 years you are more than entitled to find someone new. Your daughter is not treating you with respect either!\n\nCut her off until she starts to behave like a loving daughter who wants you to be happy. And calling your father an ass in never acceptable.", "NTA\n\nI wonder why Jane thinks Lacy is a gold digger?  Has Lacy moved in with you?  Have you purchased expensive  or luxury items for Lacy?   Does Lacy have children, and Jane is worried that you will spend significant amount of money on those children?", "You're NTA at all, but you are responsible for the status quo. Your daughter may become a mother in the future. How you play the current hand dealt to you might be reflected in the type of relationship you have with your future grandchildren.", "NTA.  It is completely unreasonable for your adult daughter to attempt to deny you from having a relationship after so many years.  Most people who lose their partners don\u2019t get into another relationship in hopes of replacing their lost loved one.  Your daughter\u2019s problems seem to be far deeper than losing her mother.  Go and live your life and be happy.", "NTA - You made sure that your kids had the time, space, and tools to handle the grief of losing their mother. \n\nOne has processed one way and seems to be doing well.\n\nThe other seems to have been somewhat emotionally stunted by the ordeal which is common with big traumas especially ones that occur at important times in our childhood development.\n\nGiven the fact that your daughter has been in therapy all this time and is reacting to this much like a child (the age she was when her mom died) it may be time to look for more helpful ways for her to cope.\n\nThere\u2019s seems to be no reason to think that your GF is a gold digger but there is reason to be concerned with your daughters behavior. You", "So I have questions and don\u2019t see where you\u2019ve mentioned it. Why does she think your gf is a gold digger? Have you two sat down and spoke about why she feels this way? I\u2019m not saying her behavior Is ok I\u2019m just curious why. The both of you being over emotional is understood but not helpful. I\u2019d talk to her explain you\u2019re happy but if she doesn\u2019t have anything concrete she needs to table it for now and you\u2019ll be aware. I\u2019m not so sure this is about her moms death. I think this is about you. She\u2019s going to have to share you with someone new and is not doing well. Id keep the promises you made but tell her you\u2019ll be inviting gf to events as you have that right but if she can\u2019t be civil that day she has the right to not attend. You can see her at different times away from gf. I\u2019d not force them together. Explain you want them both just to be able to be in the same room peacefully not that\u2019s she\u2019s to replace her mom or take her space from you.", "Why does she insist Lacy is a gold digger? Are you well off and supporting her financially?", "I don\u2019t think cutting off money for college would be a good idea. I think it will create a division that might not be mended, and since your daughter has thrown down the gold digger card, it would only be you keeping the money for you and your gf. If you threaten with money, i would hold it over if she refused to go to therapy. You may have already lost your daughter, so i would focus on her mental health. \nIf you do talk to her, I would ask her what she is not getting from you since you have dated your gf.  She may not have an answer and may force her to think. She may have an answer that would surprise you and maybe something you can work on together.", "NSH, all you\u2019re asking is for Jane to be civil with your girlfriend, but she isn\u2019t and is pretty cold towards her, which I kind of understand, she isn\u2019t over the death of her mom yet, and is still grieving for her, i\u2019m not saying that you should break up with your girlfriend absolutely not, you have the right to love anybody you want, I think what you said was justified, as for Lucy, she sounds like a caring and kind person, as of right now I see no bad guys here so I would say, give your daughter some time to adjust being with Lucy, the death of a loved, one is never easy, no matter how much time has passed", "NTA\n\n\nDo not, however, stop paying for her education and other utilities that you might be paying for. her accusations are centered on Lacy's alleged gold diggery--accusations that I suspect are trauma-born bullshit, but take that with a grain of salt because I clearly do not know details about the situation--and are rooted in finances and she will merely take your removal of financial support as proof of her suspicions. do not put Lacy in that position.\n\n\nJane is demanding empathy of you and everyone else while displaying a severe lack of empathy for both you and Lacy, which is repugnant. what I'm about to suggest will ruffle some feathers but I do not care because she is an adult woman and has had over a decade to address her grief and she has not done the work, period. so, you need to galvanize the entire family, immediate and extended. they all *need* to be aware of what your *adult* daughter is doing and saying to your girlfriend. not to chastise or alienate her but to protect Lacy. they need to know Jane's tendency to hurt Lacy and they need to help you in shutting that behavior down, not just for Lacy's sake but for Jane's as well. you cannot do this alone. everyone needs to band together to keep this things civil in family gatherings and if that means never letting Lacy be alone with Jane during these times, then so be it. don't give her any opportunities to spew her hateful vitriol. as for more intimate settings with just immediate family--dinners, movie nights, whatever--Jane does not need to be present. I don't care how harsh that sounds. remove family bonding from the situation because Jane has clearly shown that she does not want to be a part of the family you're creating. you can take her to lunch or hang out with her one-on-one outside of the home but until she can unearth the decency to treat an innocent woman who loves you with the dignity she is owed, you do not owe her lovey dovey family unit time. \n\n\nI have had similar issues with my father and I understand the tendency to want to behave poorly, I truly do. but I am also a grown woman and the level of cruelty Jane is displaying is vile. Regardless of my personal feelings, I would never have spoken to my father or anyone who purported to love him the way she has to Lacy. I am so sorry that you have to deal with this and my heart breaks for Jane, is truly does. but she cannot conduct herself the way she is, demanding your loneliness and terrorizing your partners, as she is *an adult woman* that needs to get her shit together. I hope that you can recognize that everything I have said is said with love and compassion and I wish the best for your family. even if you and Lacy do not remain together, I want everyone to feel safe and loved but most importantly, *respected*. God bless \u2665\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nBut I wouldn't cut off her college support. Tell her that she doesn't have to interact with Lacy, but that she can't keep acting like a child and lashing out at her. She doesn't have to like her, but she does have to recognize that Lacy makes you happy.", "NTA - your daughter needs some therapy to help work through this. I don\u2019t know why at 24 she is still receiving your financial support but maybe you tell her she can earn it back if she gets therapy to help sort through the trauma she has over you carrying on with your life 11 years later. She is being completely unfair and cannot see that her behavior is wrong.", "ESH. Jane's behavior is completely unacceptable but cutting her off financially as a retaliation isn't right, either. If you made an agreement with her, to underwrite her education, you should stick to it. I'd put a time limit on it, though.\n\nOn the other hand, her cruelty to you is breathtaking. I would refuse to associate with her or, at least, publicly reprimand her whenever she was rude to my friend; act like a child, get treated like a child.", "My but your daughter is a walking red flag.

Parents accept their children even when they are being AH.  Even when grown. \n\nHe can date, but i think any woman he dates should be ready for Jane.  He will need to find women with a thick skin.  They are out there.  Especially in his age range. \n\n>The daughter needs to grow up, maybe being cut off will help her realize that.\n\nWell it will ensure that OP ends up having no relationship with his daughter over a girlfriend.  That will help everyone in the family to equally hate the girlfriend.", "I mistyped, Lacy contributes and lives with me", "Believe it or not, parents do not have to put their AH children first for their entire lives. Especially when those AH children are grown adults. I don't know where this sentiment came from that you stop being your own person when you have kids, but that's such bullshit. You have broken family written all over your posts and your bitterness shows. \n\nIf OP has no relationship with his daughter, it's entirely her fault. No one in the family will take it out on the girlfriend that the daughter is being an entitled brat.", "I sincerely doubt that, Lacy gets on well with the rest of my family", "Do you think this may be the source of some of the issues?\n\n You're not my dad and I'm not 24 but it does seem kinda quick to move in with lacy and if the move in was fairly recent it might have created even more anxiety, worry and anger on Jane's part as this could be seen as lacy doing those things that her mom would do in your home.  \n\nI think it would be a bit sudden for anyone to move in together but that's just me.", ">You have broken family written all over your posts and your bitterness shows. \n\nHuh?  My family isn't broken what are you even talking about?  \n\n> OP has no relationship with his daughter, it's entirely her fault. No one in the family will take it out on the girlfriend that the daughter is being an entitled brat.\n\nLOL well I'm sure that will be a comfort to OP when he misses his daughter...that it's not his fault.", "She does now.  But i think the dynamics may change if they blame your estrangement from Jane on her."]}
