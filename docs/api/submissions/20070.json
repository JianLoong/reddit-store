If Uber is expensive, tell your roommate to  introduce this girl to public transportation.", "NTA. That's between them, not you. You're not a taxi driver. The fact he just signed you up for it and then left is rude as hell.

I find it to be very rude of your roommate to assume you'd be okay with taking his girlfriend home without consulting you. It was not your responsibility to be her ride home. Your roommate is the one who should be responsible for his girlfriend, not you.", "NTA. \n\nFirst it wasn't your responsibility, end of story. \n\nSecond, no one told you that this was a needed thing. \n\nThird, you were running late, so yes, it is nice to help out people when you can, this was not one of those times. \n\nFinally, tell your roommate that this discussion is over, and if it continues to be an issue his girlfriend needs to be around less because you won't be made to be uncomfortable in your own home. Be clear- she is not your problem, you didn't offer a ride, you weren't available to give her a ride, never volunteer me again, no I am not paying, and if you don't fully drop it and move on, we are going to have issues and I don't want that because we have been good roommates so far. \n\nIf she was \"on the way\" she could have ridden with you to work and then walked home, hopped out at a stop light, or taken an rideshare from your work.

She is by no means your responsibility, and it was an AH move from him to insinuate this.", "NTA at all", "Why did the boyfriend even decide for him(that he'll take the gf home) without telling him. that's an AH move", "Roommate should have never volunteered OP to be a taxi for his gf without asking, and for roommate to suggest that they split an Uber for the gf 3 ways as a solution is outrageously inappropriate. OP is obviously NTA. Not his gf, not his problem.", "Roommate should not have left a guest in apartment when he left to begin with. But they also should\u2019ve at least asked and figured their own shit out if the answer was no", "I'd argue it's her responsibility to have a way home if she chooses to go somewhere. Yes, the plan was probably the roommate, but she should be prepared to have to pay for taxi, Uber, or public transit in case something happens, which is what happened. But I obviously agree NTA, though unfortunately, these entitled types are usually the ones who will make life difficult for people who don't bow to their every whim.", "Why couldn't she just go home early when her bf went to work?

No boyfriend, no admittance, she should have left earlier.", "That saved me from typing that out! God tier burn! Lol", "OP literally says that it is on the way, but regardless, he was already in a hurry and stopping to drop her off would take up even more time.", "Yea this would determine whether he is the jerk or not", "Only if she can tuck and roll.", "There are so many reasons you might not want to do this \u2026 especially as a man.

He doesn't work on a highway", "It's from a comedic sign popular in the 1970s put up mostly by mechanics and office managers. It does have legs though.", "Do you mind elaborating?", "I read it", "stopping and going still takes time away from OP, who is already running late", "Im guessing here but i think they mean the risk of the girlfriend accusing him of 'inappropriate behaviour' to put it in a family friendly way."]}
