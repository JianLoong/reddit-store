They are super common.", "I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re gunning so hard to die on this hill. The OP never said he was outright banning the gf from staying over ever again. He said they need to sort out their entitlement OR she\u2019s not staying over again. Maybe you\u2019re the one who can\u2019t read?", "Now you're saying it's \"super common\" when above you admitted it wasn't common at all. Lol", "Either way wouldn\u2019t be his call to make", "I meant that false allegations are less common than real ones. Unfortunately, bad scenarios in general are super common. This is why boundaries are important", "As a woman we won't, but men are heavily influenced by a current culture of toxic masculinity that says every woman is out to cry rape at the drop of a hat.\n\nWhile their fears may have very little basis in reality, they're certainly not unfounded.", "Good for you \ud83d\udc4d Only 5% of allegations are false, but you don\u2019t want to be in that 5%", "Really? Because most people don\u2019t have a problem with that.\n\nPersonally, I think if you\u2019re not planning on doing anything wrong I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re so worried about, but I\u2019m not going to act like anyone should be forced into doing something they don\u2019t want to.\n\nMaybe unpack why you\u2019re so concerned about being \u201cfalsely\u201d accused of sexual assault.. do you behave in a way that maybe it isn\u2019t a false accusation after all", "Yeah, uh, I don't think they were saying she was entitled to a ride at all. That was a pretty massive leap", "Exactly. It may not be common but with my luck I'll end up being in that minority (a joke on my current run of bad luck with life)\n\nI do the same with other scenarios too, like I'll avoid people at night when I'm out alone/away from a crowd because I don't want to be robbed/beaten.", "False claims of robberies and other crimes are actually way higher than false SA/harassment claims, and that's without knowing the actual amount of true SA/harassment claims since they are discarded and underreported at glaringly higher rates than any other crime.", "NTA - You are not a free taxi service, plus your roommate's girlfriend is not your responsibility.", "You got to move because this isn't a good living situation", "Wtf, if something happens to the gf, you\u2019d be in trouble. Sounds like you\u2019re in a lose-lose situation. NTAH", "NTA. He wants to be with her, he gets to be late for work. You don't get to demand your room mate is late for work to help her, that's legit crazy and thinking somehow you're financially responsible for their decisions is even more ridiculous.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYour roommate should have asked you whether you'd be able to. When the situation of her getting home was brought up between them two. Which would have been ideally before she even stayed over.\n\nThe fact he feels so entitled that you'd just do it and then the further entitlement that you should pay for a 3rd of the Uber... Mind blowing.", "NTA\n\nSlippery slope. I\u2019d have actually not done it, even if I wasn\u2019t late, bc your roommate left you holding the bag. If you did it, you\u2019d be doing it quite a bit. \n\nA 45 minute commute is a long time to have someone up in your headspace. Especially if you have a long shift a head of you.", "NTA", "Explain to me why she couldn\u2019t get up with bf so he could take her home? Their relationship, their problem.", "NTA\n\nThey should have figured something out themselves. She can Uber or Lyft. They can ask, but not demand, that you help them out. You are perfectly within your right to decline.", "NTA \nThey both sound like entitled, immature assholes", "She ain't your girl and unless you are getting some benefits, you owe her nothing other than common courtesy and if you want to do any favors for them that is your choice, not theirs.", "Nta. He was scrambling to get in to a shift that meant he couldn\u2019t take his own girlfriend home. But he expects you to do it without telling you and when you are running late yourself. That\u2019s just dumb. And then to expect you to pay for it? He\u2019s the asshole.", "If you're going to start paying for her, what's your cut??\n\nYou're NTA, your roommate is.", "Wtf is this? Definitely NTA, he\u2019s girlfriend = he\u2019s responsibility", "NTA - she's not your monkey, not your problem.  Roommate & GF need to organise their lives better.", "Info: Are you also sleeping with his girlfriend? That\u2019s the only way any of this makes sense.", "INFO: what does \"on the way\" mean.\n\nIf it's literally like you're not even going a block out of your way, YTA.\n\nIf it requires actually going somewhere else thats just sort of close, NTA.", "This was my take too. The hypocrisy astounds me.", "Did you dislocate your shoulder with that long reach?", "Risk", "Would you drive a woman home though? Can a man drive a man home and a woman drive a woman? Where\u2019s the rule book? Accusations aren\u2019t limited to mixed gender interactions.", "You must get accused of rape a lot", "Lol so we\u2019re just going to pretend that Mike Pence wasn\u2019t mercilessly trolled when he said he doesn\u2019t want to be alone with a woman that isn\u2019t his wife? None of those people would have been women right \ud83d\ude44", "No, they\u2019re not, and you know why?\n\nBecause instead of punishing sexual assault type behaviors we shame women who report it or refuse to hold the men accountable, so it perpetuates a culture of blurring the lines and \u201ceveryone does this, this isn\u2019t harassment or assault don\u2019t be so dramatic\u201d and no one even thinks it\u2019s a problem.\n\nSo when they behave in a way they think is perfectly fine and normal like taking home an obscenely drunk woman and pressuring her til she says yes, they\u2019re surprised pikachu when they get accused of rape. Cause that\u2019s normal right? Yeah, of course they\u2019re afraid of \u201cfalse\u201d accusations", "OP wouldn\u2019t even need to be there for her to file false accusation. It\u2019s his apartment. She could just make a sob story based on your logic. Most of the false claims do this anyway. It\u2019s not rooted in anything that make sense. The basic defense for him is that he wasn\u2019t there & didn\u2019t do anything. Can\u2019t have a case without proof or evidence", "NTA. The roommate could have dropped her off on his way in early. If she doesn't have her own transport, it's up to them to sort out.", "Your friend sounds like a real clown", "NTA. Your roommate should have ordered an uber before he left.", "NTA \n\nNot your girlfriend, not your circus, not your monkey.", "NTA \ud83d\ude02 he didn't even ask you first. At least she will know now not to just take his word for it when it comes to her being in time for things", "NTA", "Op's roommate and the gf should split the uber \\*2\\* ways, and leave OP out of the equation.", "NTA.  Your roommate should have woken you up and asked, then maybe you wouldn't have been running late.  But to just leave and tell his GF that you'd take her without asking is a big \"No\".\n\nShe either needs to have a way home herself or your roommate needs to make arrangements for her.", "NTA. Not your problem or your roommates. It\u2019s fully the responsibility of the GF.", "Esh", "*OBVIOUSLY* NTA lol, not even a question in my mind", "NTA, and roommate needs to stop leaving his unattended guests around gour apartment. GF should not even have been there after your roommate left.", "Roommate's girlfriend is not OP's responsibility. \n\nRoommate and his girlfriend sound like spoiled brats to blame OP for their predicament. \n\nOf course it would be out of OP's way and make him later for work. He can't throw her out of a moving car. Detours take time.\n\nThey thought they could back him into a corner. When people get upset about reasonable boundaries, like not wanting to be late for work for something you didn't agree to do, they are in it for themselves and not you.", "your username and this comment are conflicting", "I mean, they usually are though?", "The amount of false accusations is so low that yall's fear is not warranted. Don't flatter yourselves.", "Women don\u2019t tend to get accused of rape, so no. Can\u2019t say I am.", "Why would a dude feel uncomfortable around a woman unless he doesn't trust himself to keep his hands and mouth to himself? It's not that hard to NOT sexually harass and assault somebody. Stop deflecting and acting like the woman even existing is the fucking problem. That shit is tired.", "Nobody brought up falsely accusing except for you asshats. That's not what this is about. All you are doing is exposing yourselves for admitting to not having any willpower and not being able to control yourselves around the opposite gender."]}
