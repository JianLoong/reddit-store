My (f, 24) best friend (f, 22) is getting married in just under 3 weeks. I was supposed to be a bridesmaid, and I\u2019ve been excited for the wedding since before the engagement (I knew her partner was going to propose). I\u2019ve helped with making decisions on the wedding, helped with the hen do (bachelorette party) and bought my bridesmaid dress and booked my hotel. I love them as a couple and they\u2019re both my bestest friends.\n\nI\u2019ve been with my boyfriend (m, 24) for 2.5 years and have known him and his family for 10 years. When we first became a couple, he told me his dad has terminal lung cancer. 3 months ago, we found out that the cancer had spread to his brain and he was given 3 months to live. Over that time, his health started to decline slowly, and then suddenly over the last month. Due to all of this, we had to miss the hen do as we would have to be away for a few days but we didn\u2019t want to leave my partners dad (my best friend and I live 2 hours apart and we don\u2019t drive). Trains are expensive and take even longer than driving so a last minute rush from the hen do to his dad would be near impossible if anything was to happen. \n\nWe are now at the end of his dad\u2019s prognosis and he is currently in the last stages of death. A few days ago, my best friend demanded an answer on if we would be at the wedding or not. Up until then, we believed we would\u2019ve been able to attend but now we are unsure what will happen. As she demanded an answer since she didn\u2019t want us to cancel last minute, we decided to decline attending as we didn\u2019t want to leave it to the day before, despite us being heartbroken we won\u2019t be there. \n\nA few weeks ago, my best friend said to make my boyfriend\u2019s dad the priority over the wedding day. She clearly changed her mind as in response to my message explaining our choice, she only screenshotted it and then instantly kicked me from the bridesmaid group chat. Then she ignored me for the following few days. When she finally responded, she said that she understood why my partner wasn\u2019t attending but didn\u2019t understand why I wasn\u2019t, and she was devastated and angry over the choice. I explained that I refuse to leave my partner alone during one of the hardest things he\u2019ll experience, plus his dad also means a lot to me as I went no contact with my dad 2 years ago and since then, my boyfriend\u2019s dad has basically stepped up and been a father figure to me, so I want to be there for him too. I\u2019m also disabled and haven\u2019t traveled alone overnight since 2019. She\u2019s still really upset and angry and is ignoring me once again. She\u2019d said that a few people in her life were on her side, yet people in my life understand my pov and are upset and shocked with her. So I\u2019m confused. Am I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: just to answer some things - I\u2019m disabled and in a wheelchair/scooter so I do not have the help or extra arms to bring my things and transport myself alone. She had said that if this was reversed, she would attend the wedding. I told her I could\u2019ve tried and gone just on the day but she really needed an answer there and then. I would\u2019ve found a way to do it but she wanted a set response", "created_utc": 1692267072, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15tj66o/aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_i_wont_go_to_her/", "score": 633, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Either way take care of your partner and be there for him like he would for you.", "NTA.\n\nSometimes life presents us with a no-win situation like this, and you just have to go with your gut.\n\nAll you can do is clearly communicate how you feel and why you're doing what you're doing. Don't feel bad for making your choice. You didn't schedule this all to happen at the same time. Whatever happens next happens.", "NTA, you\u2019re doing the right thing by supporting your partner during a truly horrible situation. I\u2019m getting quite frustrated and angry with all these brides who think the whole world should stop and bow down to them because they\u2019re getting married. So much emphasis on one day instead of the actual marriage itself. Sending hugs to you, your partner and his family.", "NTA Being there for your partner during the loss of a parent takes priority.", "NTA. This is a tough situation to be in but I think you made the right call. It sucks that your \u201cfriend\u201d can\u2019t be more understanding", "NTA. Family death overrides wedding every single time. Your best friend is being incredibly selfish. I lost my dad family suddenly, I wouldn't have survived without my husbands support. I am sorry for your loss, and I hope this doesn't add too much stress to what you're already going through", "NTA...You are being a supportive partner. Someone about to get married should be a little more cognizant of this. I would question this friendship. In the meantime,  keep doing what you're doing.", "NTA. Tell your friend to grow up and grow some empathy.", "NTA --- This person is not your friend, a real friend would understand this situation and wouldn't expect you to ditch your boyfriend and his family when his father is dying for whatever reason.", "NTA. Wedding prep changes a lot of people; usually if you see it on Reddit, it was for the worse lol", "NTA \n\nI\u2019ve buried both my parents. You will never regret spending every moment possible with them while they are still here. Even just sitting holding his hand will be something you will treasure later. I lost my father 13 years ago.

I would rethink this friendship for sure.", "NTA. Death is forever. There won\u2019t be many more opportunities for you to be there for your partner and his father once he\u2019s passed. Statistically, your friend will probably get divorced and married again. It\u2019s upsetting to not have you there but she gets to be alive and for that, you will have more time to spend together. Sorry she doesn\u2019t understand that.", "NTA. So not the asshole. What your friend said was so out of line. I understand that you being a bridesmaid and her being your best friend made it sting more bc she was counting on you to be there for her special day, but you were struggling with the decision.

You can never see someone that passes away again, ever. It would be incredibly insensitive and damaging to your relationship to abandon your partner at his father\u2019s deathbed. Your friend being upset is understandable, but frankly she\u2019s being selfish and immature.", "NTA - focus on your family and making Dad as comfortable as possible. I'm so sorry you're both going through this.

Your \"best friend\" should understand that when your partner is having a really hard time you should be there, times like this only strengthen the relationship. And also if the father of your boyfriend has been there for you, like a father, gives more reasons of why you should be there. Period.", "NTA.  Support your boyfriend and his father.  Your \"friend's\" reaction shows that you're better off without her.", "NTA\nI can understand her being upset in the moment, but you\u2019re in a difficult position, making the only decision you can reasonably make. \nGive her time, hopefully she will get perspective in time.", "NTA. The last few weeks before a wedding tend to be stressful and brides can wind up behaving very unlike their normal selves.  You go support your  partner. That\u2019s what he needs you to do. And it would be impossible for you to enjoy the party while being concerned about him, or mourning a great loss.   \n\n\nHopefully when the wedding is over she will calm down and be the friend you\u2019ve always known", "NTA.\n\nI would love to see a statistics of how many friendships end because of crazy brides.", "NTA You said your friend is upset and angry, think what you meant to say is she is selfish and juvenile. Pretty much everything you posted is irrelevant; the only thing that matters is a loved one is in their final stage of life, nothing more. Death is forever and there is no do- over!  Don\u2019t apologize, don\u2019t say you are sorry, just state you need to be there for your loved one in their last days. Period dot.  See this \u2018friend for who they are and bow out of the relationship.", "NTA as if she doesn't understand what it means to support your life partner in such absolutely awful situation, maybe she shouldn't get married.", "She already told you that she'd understand if you needed to prioritise your partner's dad in his last days. So, when she *wasn't* stressed, she got it. Right now she *is* stressed and she's not being a good friend. Hopefully after the wedding she'll calm down and be more understanding. For now, you are 100% doing the right thing by supporting your partner and his dad and you need to block out the white noise of anyone saying otherwise. It'll all pass and - in the end - even if you do eventually end up losing your friend over this, if she really can't understand that you felt you had to do what your doing, then you'll at least know that you did the right thing regardless.", "NTA\n\nHere's the double edged sword: while you wouldn't wish this brutal process on your worst enemy, much less your best friend, it's something you can only understand if you've gone through it. \n\nLikely, someday, your friend will go through a similar experience, and then maybe she will have some empathy for the choices laid before you. Your wedding day seems so important until it's over and you realize how ridiculous the whole thing is: marriage is a choice you make daily, not a bit elaborate one-day celebration.", "NTA. It's more important for friends to support each other during hard times than it is for them to attend special events. She's being dismissive of your feelings when you need support, while she needs party attendance. She's a bad friend and she should be ashamed of herself.", "NTA you have no choice here Op plus you actually want and need to be with your father in law. I get your friend is disappointed and probably will never understand until sadly she is in the same position. Once this is over realisation that you had to do what is right for you then maybe she will apologise then again maybe not. If she doesn\u2019t she is the one with warped values and not you. I\u2019m so sad you are going through this. Cherish those last days\ud83d\udc95", "NTA, you are clearly being a supportive partner for your BF. \n\nAlso, if your \"friend\" treats her new husband the way she's treated you, I anticipate you'll be able to attend her next wedding instead.", "NTA. And tell her if she doesn\u2019t understand why you\u2019d want to support your husband in those difficult times then she obviously doesn\u2019t understand love, support and partnership and shouldn\u2019t get married. Or (maybe the less nuclear option) ask her what she would do if her dad was dying and you were demanding her husband\u2019s presence at your wedding ? Basically, what would wished do is she were your husband and her fianc\u00e9 you?", "NTA\n\nYour partner should come first. The loss of a loved one, or in this case, the eminent loss, trumps a bachelorette party and a wedding. Your friend needs to GTFO herself. The world does not revolve around her. Be there for your partner. He needs you more than she does.", "NAH. This is simply bad timing that no one can do anything about. I can understand why you don't want to leave your boyfriend alone. But also your friend is not wrong for wanting you there. Try attending her wedding alone if possible but if you can't you also have to understand that your friendship will be greatly affected by this.", "INFO: Would she come to your wedding if her FIL was dying?", "NAH she has every right to be pissed.  If he died right before the wedding or there was a funeral day of ywnbta but in this circumstance you have abandoned your friend at an important time for months to support your boy friend and she is justified in being upset for being treated with 0 priority.", "NTA. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, you are. But I think you made the right call. Supporting your significant other during the death of a loved one trumps a wedding.", "NTA.\n\nYou are absolutely doing the right thing, and your friend ought to realise this. However, you could always try consoling her by saying: \"Don't worry, I'll come to your next wedding instead.\" /s", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Jfc", "It's even ok to say something like \"while I'm really sad you won't be able to make it, and I would have loved to have you there, I completely understand why you won't be, I'm so sorry you're going through all of that.\"", "This is the right thing. Being bummed out vs. lashing out are two very different responses to a \"that makes me sad\" scenario.", "Agreed. But also, if it was *this* close a friend, I wouldn't demand to know so far in advance. Maybe I'd ask her to step down from the wedding party if she couldn't commit to being there and the uncertainty was causing logistical problems, but I'd make it clear I'd still love to have her as a guest if she could make it, keep her seat open, and just eat the cost of she couldn't make it last minute.", "There is a big difference between being disappointed, even tremendously disappointed, that her BFF can\u2019t attend, and being angry at her that she can\u2019t attend. The later is uncalled for and all around pretty shitty.\n\nNTA", "That's exactly what I was thinking.", "Yeah I'm ngl I could see myself being pretty upset. But I'm also smart enough to stfu about it to the person and save the 'why couldn't they figure something out\" venting for my partner. You can have irrational feelings, feelings aren't rational. But it's your job to deal with them", "And check in with my friend daily to see if I can help her! That bride is no friend. I\u2019ve had people I don\u2019t care for treat me better!", "Fuck, I really hope you are all better now, wishing you the best", "I got married in November and joined a bunch of bridal groups in the process. It was wild to me how crazy people get and how much they are enabled by other brides in the group and their families lol. I agree with you, OP a should be the one holding the grudge because that is not a friend", "When I got married (30 yrs ago), the caterer forgot to unload all the food from her van and couldn't be reached for a couple hours (no cell phones), my mom lost her mind over a wrist corsage sent to me by my husband, one of the officiants wore jeans and cowboy boots (formal evening event), same officiant didn't bother to prepare his texts (so he had a pile of oversized photo copies hanging out of his book of the service), one of the musicians failed to to a sound check and could barely be heard.\n\nSTILL THE VERY BEST DAY OF MY LIFE, because at the end of it all we were MARRIED.\n\nedit punctuation", "My thoughts exactly. I am petty though and after how she behaved I would reassure her I would be there for her next wedding. \ud83d\ude2c", "People have lost sight of what marriage is and just want that \"perfect wedding\" that \"perfect day\"", "100%\n\n\nWhen my ex and I were getting married, I told him - it's not the wedding that counts, it's what happens after. \nI saw my wedding as more of a chore, and was happy my ex mother-in-law organised most of the stuff, especially for his side of the family (I moved countries, so I didn't know anyone here). \n\n\nWe ended up having three(!) celebrations - one with us and our families (an official registration day), then a celebration with his friends and family, then a celebration with my friends and family in my home country. \n\n\nNever again! I couldn't understand who it was all done for - us, or family and friends.", "Weddings are such a pain in the ass.  My wife and I did the court house / back yard wedding and if you could make it then great, if you couldn\u2019t, no worries.  \n\nRecently I fucked up pretty bad. My wife is a giver, to the point she will bankrupt herself. Over the years the balance gets withdrawn faster and takes longer to fill.  I came across mistake fare tickets to Paris for 230 a piece so I bought them without looking lol, 3 for 680 total including my kid. Figured we needed an escape.  Wouldn\u2019t you know, we have a god damn wedding that week where she\u2019s a bridesmaid.  Her friend is selfish by nature, not a bad person, but childless and wrapped up in her own life.  \n\nThis wedding has been the point of convo for almost a year (she\u2019s already had one bachelorette party for those who can\u2019t make the real one in Fort Lauderdale) but I don\u2019t ever really pay attention\u2026 hence the mistake.  Wife actually decided to say \u201cfuck it let\u2019s go. She probably won\u2019t even want to be my friend afterwards\u201d \n\nAll this guilt and bullshit because we\u2019re gonna miss a day where 200 other people are there and you\u2019ll forget half of it by Christmas. \n\nEven worse was my wife was the one who got them together, even if her friend hates every time we bring it up, though I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be used against us. \n\nAnyway sorry for the rant.  I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m the asshole or not.  At some point you just gotta put family first. I\u2019m 40 now and have had life long friends come and go over nothing and you gotta realize the ones you choose to spend life with come first.", "NTA\n\nThis reads like the friend hasn't had a close loss in their life such as a parent or close friend.  It's something I've found that unless you've experienced it yourself it's just so alien people have difficulty empathizing.  Knowing how stressful weddings can be stressing out as the date comes near and decisions become irreversable I can understand some of her freakout.  If the friend stops here and doesn't go nuclear later the friendship could probably heal.", "Yeah, logistically I think it would have been understandable to say something like \"hey if you're not sure if you'll be able to make it or not please let me know and I can ask XYZ person to step in as bridesmaid. But I hope you can make it and we'll save you a seat!\"\n\nWhile obviously it doesn't remotely compare to watching your father slowly die of cancer, chasing down outstanding RSVPs as your wedding approaches honestly is pretty stressful so I could have extended some sympathy to the bride if she'd been more reasonable about it--but she has got to realize these are extremely extenuating circumstances and she really needed to accept that OP couldn't possibly know in advance what the situation would be on the wedding day.", "You do know that they have to pay for every RSVP even if they don't show right? It's very expensive to pay for food that will just be thrown away. Asking for an RSVP is not an AH move. Overreacting like she is doing is an AH move though. Being upset about your best friend not being there on one of the most important days in your life thus far is understandable, but to get angry over prioritizing a dying person is unacceptable.", "My aunt got married a few months ago and had to have a final count for her venue over a month before the wedding. The bride may not have a choice\u2014if the venue wants a final count far enough in advance and it would cost a fair amount of money to have no-shows, it makes total sense to ask a few weeks beforehand.", "So wrong \ud83d\ude02", "Who cares? It is someone she loves and a partner\u2019s parent. Any suggestion that she should leave her partner to deal with this alone and potentially never see the dying loved one again in order to attend a wedding is ludicrous.", "I agree. As a Covid marriage, I had to often comfort my wife that sometimes shit happens, and you just have to roll with the punches that life throws your way.\n\nHardly any weddings are \"perfect,\" and there's nothing wrong with that. It's still a special day and one to be celebrated. Just gotta focus on the big picture, rather than try to control and lament over every little detail that goes wrong.\n\nLittle things that go wrong can sometimes be an opportunity for something special. The best friend groomsman that couldn't make it opens an opportunity to make something special to your brother-in-law by asking him. It's easy to focus on the negative. But sometimes life throws you curveballs that open the door for other moments to happen.\n\nLife is all about perspective", "Of course I understand. That's why I said I'd eat the cost if they couldn't make it.\n\nI also didn't say it was an asshole move to ask for the rsvp. Though, frankly, I do think it's especially rich of her to be upset at OP for prioritizing being there for her partner when she's clearly prioritizing the cost of one (or possibly two) plates over keeping open the possibility of her best friend attending.", "Dude idk how I could even try to make my future wedding perfect... We'd have to divide the church into 4ths instead of 2 sides. My parents are divorced and hate each other. My bf's parents are divorced and hate each other. His parents don't like my parents and my parents don't like his. Lol\n\nI don't plan on having something fancy but I don't want a courthouse wedding which is the 1st thing ppl suggest every time... Nothing wrong with ppl who do that but it's annoying that people think if ur not having a big fancy wedding then you should just not celebrate at all. \n\nI think a small venue with more security than family and anyone who starts shit will be dragged out. I'll be wearing my mom's wedding dress my grandmother made by hand. 50 pounds of pearls sewn to that dress! It will be the fanciest thing at the wedding. And I'm not wearing it to be fancy, but because Grandma made it and she didn't live long enough to make me my own.", "Not everyone can afford it. Some people literally spend over $100 a plate.", "This is not what they're saying. If a guest's loved one has passed away or is end of life, then the guest should prioritise their dying/dead loved one over the wedding.\n\nNot that every dying person ever is more important than the wedding. \n\nYou know what they were saying and decided to twist it.", "What\u2019s wrong with you? A father in law dying is absolutely a valid reason not to go to a friends wedding. It\u2019s just an unfortunate occurrence, the timing bad luck, and that\u2019s what the bride should have chalked it up to.", "r/woosh", "How ridiculous and callous.", "The money's already been spent either way.", "Sure. Though if you're spending $100 a plate on anything other than a very small wedding and can't afford to eat $100-200 dollars, that sounds like you're spending too much on your wedding. Most people I know who spend that much per plate are spending at least ten thousand+ on the wedding overall (often much more than that).\n\nAnd I'm just saying: if you have that much to spend on the wedding, really, what is $100-200 to keep open the possibility of your best friend making it? We're not talking a second tier guest here, we're talking someone in the wedding party.\n\nFine for her to decide the money isn't worth it, but by prioritizing that money, SHE'S the one who is closing the door on the possibility of op being there, because she's the one demanding op make the choice before op can possibly know exactly how the bf's dad will be doing at the wedding. Which, like, fair enough. But to then turn around and get mad when op makes the obvious choice is especially galling to me.", "That\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re saying. Because I already pointed out that the bride might not be aware of the relationship OP has  with the boyfriends dad. That\u2019s a reasonable argument. \n\nBut other person chose to ignore that and kept emphasizing the fact that somebody is dying. Sorry, but I\u2019m not twisting anything.", "What\u2019s wrong with you? This isn\u2019t her father-in-law.  OP has been with boyfriend for 2.5 years.  That\u2019s a decent amount of time, but nowhere near \u201clife partner\u201c status. \n\nIt\u2019s quite possible that the bride is not aware of the nature of the relationship between OP on and her boyfriend\u2019s father.", "I\u2019m sorry that the response went over your head. If you have a question, feel free to ask.", "No it hasn't. I just got married two months ago and the caterer did not accept payment (apart from deposit) until after the wedding. And the full contract (how many meals) was settled a week before. Some caterers make you settle 2-4 weeks prior, but now the bride is able to know this before signing her contract. Again, the simple RSVP and not paying for unused plates is not what makes the bride the AH. It's her reaction that makes her the AH.", "This is delusional.", "Right, he\u2019s basically a stranger, what\u2019s she so upset about", "Friend, the bride is her best friend how would she not know the relationship between her bridesmaid/best friend and the dying loved one ? \n\nYou're being obtuse", "k", "Lol. Just because I don\u2019t agree with your shitty take doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m obtuse. You don\u2019t know what the OP has shared with her best friend. Just because it\u2019s her best friend doesn\u2019t mean she shares every detail of her life, especially when it\u2019s not her own dad."]}
