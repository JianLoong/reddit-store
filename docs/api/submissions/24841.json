My (f, 24) best friend (f, 22) is getting married in just under 3 weeks. I was supposed to be a bridesmaid, and I\u2019ve been excited for the wedding since before the engagement (I knew her partner was going to propose). I\u2019ve helped with making decisions on the wedding, helped with the hen do (bachelorette party) and bought my bridesmaid dress and booked my hotel. I love them as a couple and they\u2019re both my bestest friends.\n\nI\u2019ve been with my boyfriend (m, 24) for 2.5 years and have known him and his family for 10 years. When we first became a couple, he told me his dad has terminal lung cancer. 3 months ago, we found out that the cancer had spread to his brain and he was given 3 months to live. Over that time, his health started to decline slowly, and then suddenly over the last month. Due to all of this, we had to miss the hen do as we would have to be away for a few days but we didn\u2019t want to leave my partners dad (my best friend and I live 2 hours apart and we don\u2019t drive). Trains are expensive and take even longer than driving so a last minute rush from the hen do to his dad would be near impossible if anything was to happen. \n\nWe are now at the end of his dad\u2019s prognosis and he is currently in the last stages of death. A few days ago, my best friend demanded an answer on if we would be at the wedding or not. Up until then, we believed we would\u2019ve been able to attend but now we are unsure what will happen. As she demanded an answer since she didn\u2019t want us to cancel last minute, we decided to decline attending as we didn\u2019t want to leave it to the day before, despite us being heartbroken we won\u2019t be there. \n\nA few weeks ago, my best friend said to make my boyfriend\u2019s dad the priority over the wedding day. She clearly changed her mind as in response to my message explaining our choice, she only screenshotted it and then instantly kicked me from the bridesmaid group chat. Then she ignored me for the following few days. When she finally responded, she said that she understood why my partner wasn\u2019t attending but didn\u2019t understand why I wasn\u2019t, and she was devastated and angry over the choice. I explained that I refuse to leave my partner alone during one of the hardest things he\u2019ll experience, plus his dad also means a lot to me as I went no contact with my dad 2 years ago and since then, my boyfriend\u2019s dad has basically stepped up and been a father figure to me, so I want to be there for him too. I\u2019m also disabled and haven\u2019t traveled alone overnight since 2019. She\u2019s still really upset and angry and is ignoring me once again. She\u2019d said that a few people in her life were on her side, yet people in my life understand my pov and are upset and shocked with her. So I\u2019m confused.

Then ignore her and move on with your life. \n\nShe will either see reason and apologise blaming the reaction on the stress of the wedding, or she won\u2019t. Either way take care of your partner and be there for him like he would for you.", "NTA.\n\nSometimes life presents us with a no-win situation like this, and you just have to go with your gut.\n\nAll you can do is clearly communicate how you feel and why you're doing what you're doing. Don't feel bad for making your choice. You didn't schedule this all to happen at the same time. Whatever happens next happens.", "NTA, you\u2019re doing the right thing by supporting your partner during a truly horrible situation. I\u2019m getting quite frustrated and angry with all these brides who think the whole world should stop and bow down to them because they\u2019re getting married. So much emphasis on one day instead of the actual marriage itself. Sending hugs to you, your partner and his family.", "NTA Being there for your partner during the loss of a parent takes priority.", "NTA. This is a tough situation to be in but I think you made the right call. It sucks that your \u201cfriend\u201d can\u2019t be more understanding", "NTA. Family death overrides wedding every single time. Your best friend is being incredibly selfish. I lost my dad family suddenly, I wouldn't have survived without my husbands support. I am sorry for your loss, and I hope this doesn't add too much stress to what you're already going through", "NTA...You are being a supportive partner. Someone about to get married should be a little more cognizant of this. I would question this friendship. In the meantime,  keep doing what you're doing.", "NTA. Tell your friend to grow up and grow some empathy.", "NTA --- This person is not your friend, a real friend would understand this situation and wouldn't expect you to ditch your boyfriend and his family when his father is dying for whatever reason.", "NTA. Wedding prep changes a lot of people; usually if you see it on Reddit, it was for the worse lol", "NTA \n\nI\u2019ve buried both my parents. You will never regret spending every moment possible with them while they are still here. Even just sitting holding his hand will be something you will treasure later. I lost my father 13 years ago. I remember my time with him at the end like it was yesterday.\n\nI remember pieces of weddings I\u2019ve been to and in throughout the years for people. But nothing like the time with my parents. You have absolutely made the right decision. It\u2019s unfortunate that your friend doesn\u2019t understand. Maybe she will some day.", "Nope, she is TA. I would rethink this friendship for sure.", "NTA. Death is forever. There won\u2019t be many more opportunities for you to be there for your partner and his father once he\u2019s passed. Statistically, your friend will probably get divorced and married again. It\u2019s upsetting to not have you there but she gets to be alive and for that, you will have more time to spend together. Sorry she doesn\u2019t understand that.", "NTA. So not the asshole. What your friend said was so out of line. I understand that you being a bridesmaid and her being your best friend made it sting more bc she was counting on you to be there for her special day, but you were struggling with the decision.

This is one of the hardest things he will have to go through & he needs you.\n\nA true friend would understand.", "NTA. You can see a newly married couple any time for the next ~50 years. You can never see someone that passes away again, ever. It would be incredibly insensitive and damaging to your relationship to abandon your partner at his father\u2019s deathbed. Your friend being upset is understandable, but frankly she\u2019s being selfish and immature.", "NTA - focus on your family and making Dad as comfortable as possible. I'm so sorry you're both going through this. Ignore the best friend for now because a wedding is not in any way as important as the moments you will spend with your bf dad now.", "NTA \n\nNot at all.", "NTA. Your \"best friend\" should understand that when your partner is having a really hard time you should be there, times like this only strengthen the relationship. And also if the father of your boyfriend has been there for you, like a father, gives more reasons of why you should be there. Period.", "NTA.  Support your boyfriend and his father.  Your \"friend's\" reaction shows that you're better off without her.", "NTA\nI can understand her being upset in the moment, but you\u2019re in a difficult position, making the only decision you can reasonably make. \nGive her time, hopefully she will get perspective in time.", "NTA. The last few weeks before a wedding tend to be stressful and brides can wind up behaving very unlike their normal selves.  You go support your  partner. That\u2019s what he needs you to do. And it would be impossible for you to enjoy the party while being concerned about him, or mourning a great loss.   \n\n\nHopefully when the wedding is over she will calm down and be the friend you\u2019ve always known", "NTA.\n\nI would love to see a statistics of how many friendships end because of crazy brides.", "NTA You said your friend is upset and angry, think what you meant to say is she is selfish and juvenile. Pretty much everything you posted is irrelevant; the only thing that matters is a loved one is in their final stage of life, nothing more. Death is forever and there is no do- over!  Don\u2019t apologize, don\u2019t say you are sorry, just state you need to be there for your loved one in their last days. Period dot.  See this \u2018friend for who they are and bow out of the relationship.", "NTA as if she doesn't understand what it means to support your life partner in such absolutely awful situation, maybe she shouldn't get married.", "She already told you that she'd understand if you needed to prioritise your partner's dad in his last days. So, when she *wasn't* stressed, she got it. Right now she *is* stressed and she's not being a good friend. Hopefully after the wedding she'll calm down and be more understanding. For now, you are 100% doing the right thing by supporting your partner and his dad and you need to block out the white noise of anyone saying otherwise. It'll all pass and - in the end - even if you do eventually end up losing your friend over this, if she really can't understand that you felt you had to do what your doing, then you'll at least know that you did the right thing regardless.", "NTA\n\nHere's the double edged sword: while you wouldn't wish this brutal process on your worst enemy, much less your best friend, it's something you can only understand if you've gone through it. \n\nLikely, someday, your friend will go through a similar experience, and then maybe she will have some empathy for the choices laid before you. Your wedding day seems so important until it's over and you realize how ridiculous the whole thing is: marriage is a choice you make daily, not a bit elaborate one-day celebration.", "NTA. It's more important for friends to support each other during hard times than it is for them to attend special events. She's being dismissive of your feelings when you need support, while she needs party attendance. She's a bad friend and she should be ashamed of herself.", "NTA you have no choice here Op plus you actually want and need to be with your father in law. I get your friend is disappointed and probably will never understand until sadly she is in the same position. Once this is over realisation that you had to do what is right for you then maybe she will apologise then again maybe not. If she doesn\u2019t she is the one with warped values and not you. I\u2019m so sad you are going through this. Cherish those last days\ud83d\udc95", "NTA, you are clearly being a supportive partner for your BF. \n\nAlso, if your \"friend\" treats her new husband the way she's treated you, I anticipate you'll be able to attend her next wedding instead.", "NTA. And tell her if she doesn\u2019t understand why you\u2019d want to support your husband in those difficult times then she obviously doesn\u2019t understand love, support and partnership and shouldn\u2019t get married. Or (maybe the less nuclear option) ask her what she would do if her dad was dying and you were demanding her husband\u2019s presence at your wedding ? Basically, what would wished do is she were your husband and her fianc\u00e9 you?", "NTA\n\nYour partner should come first. The loss of a loved one, or in this case, the eminent loss, trumps a bachelorette party and a wedding. Your friend needs to GTFO herself. The world does not revolve around her. Be there for your partner. He needs you more than she does.", "NAH. This is simply bad timing that no one can do anything about. I can understand why you don't want to leave your boyfriend alone. But also your friend is not wrong for wanting you there. Try attending her wedding alone if possible but if you can't you also have to understand that your friendship will be greatly affected by this.", "INFO: Would she come to your wedding if her FIL was dying?", "NAH she has every right to be pissed.  If he died right before the wedding or there was a funeral day of ywnbta but in this circumstance you have abandoned your friend at an important time for months to support your boy friend and she is justified in being upset for being treated with 0 priority.", "NTA. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, you are. But I think you made the right call. Supporting your significant other during the death of a loved one trumps a wedding.", "NTA.\n\nYou are absolutely doing the right thing, and your friend ought to realise this. However, you could always try consoling her by saying: \"Don't worry, I'll come to your next wedding instead.\" /s", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's more important than being a guest at a wedding.", "I'm not saying the best friend doesn't suck, in fact I'm changing it to ESH for this one.", "The person dying is literally not the bridesmaid\u2019s dad.", "I still disagree that OP sucks. Why does she 'suck' for choosing her husband's grief over her friend's wedding when you yourself say it's a difficult decision that leaves people feeling hurt either way?", "Didn't say it was. It is still an important person to her. It could be her dad, her boyfriends dad, a friend etc. Someone dying is more important than a wedding.", "Not agreeing or disagreeing with your post here, but just pointing out that she isn't married and this is her boyfriend. \n\nShe's still NTA for me personally.", "If that\u2019s the case; then she shouldn\u2019t have the wedding at all, since literally 100k people die every single day.", "Omg.
