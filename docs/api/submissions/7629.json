We all work as freelance creatives and don\u2019t earn loads. \n\nOur next door neighbour Anna (names changed obvs) moved in a few months ago. She has two small children (c8-10) and is a single mum. I was raised by a single mum and so obviously wanted to make sure she was okay, I said if she needed a hand settling in just to let us know. \n\nA week later she knocked on my door asking to use the Wi-Fi for her kids, saying she was having trouble getting the electrician in. Totally fine. \n\nA couple weeks pass, and we get a knock on the door and a child (her child) is standing there with a mobile asking for the password. I give it to him as I\u2019m not really going to say no to a child. \n\nA month or so passes, and we are having a few issues with the Wi-Fi. Nothing major, just buffering and stop and starts on zoom calls. But I work from home sometimes so need fast wifi. I texted Anna asking if she has got an electrician in (I know she hasn\u2019t as I can see she is connected, but as a gentle nudge). There are now seven additional devices on our Wi-Fi at this point. \n\nShe says she\u2019s still having issues getting an electrician in. Fine, whatever. It\u2019s around the holidays, I get it. \n\nFast forward to now, it\u2019s been nearly three months and no sign of an electrician, all her devices are currently using our Wi-Fi, and we are still having issues with speed. We could upgrade it to be faster, but it\u2019s about 20$ more a month. My roommate says just to cut her off and not say anything, but I feel bad doing that to a single mum.\n\nShe also has not attempted any kind of contact/friendship with us besides asking for the Wi-Fi, or asked to extend using it/offer to chip in for it. We have been friendly, given her a gift for Xmas and offered to babysit should she need (5+yrs experience doing this). \n\nWIBTA for just cutting it off/claiming we are having issues w it? TIA\n\nEdit for clarity: she said engineer, not electrician.

Saying she needs an electrician for wifi doesn't really make sense.", "NTA but I\u2019d let her know before you cut her off, and be really clear. \u201cHi neighbour, I\u2019ve been happy to share up till now but I really need my wifi to be clear for work going forward and your families use is impacting the connection. I\u2019m going to update the network so you won\u2019t be able to use it any further from [date] so you really need to get your electrician sorted.\u201d\nIf she is annoyed  after that\u2019s on her not you, but it would be a bit of a mean move to just cut it off with no warning and ghost her.", "NTA. She\u2019s milking you, charge her a fee or cut her off.", "NTA - sounds like you have been a lovely and very generous neighbor\n\nI think she is likely taking advantage. Why would you pay your own bill when you can use your neighbors for free? I do feel bad for her as money is likely tight but that doesn't make mooching ok and it's not fair on your household\n\nI would explain to her that you are going to have to stop her from using the WiFi because it is causing issues for your work. This would give her time to set up her own connection before you close off yours. Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think you need an electrician? So she should be able to get it sorted quickly\n\nYou are in no way obliged to do this but the idea of being stuck in a house with two kids whos tablets suddenly don't work is nightmarish \ud83d\ude02. You would be doing her (another!) favor", "NTA - your neighbor is obviously abusing your generosity.", "NTA - Not at all. You did a kind thing for someone and they have clearly been taking advantage of you. Cut and dry.\n\nI know it would be awkward but I'd think about changing the password and just leaving her a note letting her know you did so. This isn't at all necessary but addresses the feeling you worry about. You can empathize (and you clearly have) without letting yourself get taken advantage of. Everyone will survive for a week without internet access until they get their own.", "YWNBTA. You're too kind OP. She's taking advantage of it.", "NTA - but have a conversation with her! If your internet is working better now with the upgrade maybe you can ask her to pay the $20 extra a month. That would save her a ton of money setting up her own. If she says no or gets upset than just change the passwords and downgrade the internet.", "NTA. Cut her off and tell her you cant fund it anymore and that she's had ample time to sort it out. Don't lie to her and don't worry about sparing her feelings - she's not shy with mooching off you.", "Well, here it is. The AITA I was born to address.\n\nFirst off, NTA for cutting her off. I'm not sure where you are, but I really doubt it takes 3 months to get Internet in a place where the house next door is already wired. You don't really want to pursue a compromise where she pays extra for you to increase your speed, because that may not even fix the problem. WiFi speed tends to be made slower by devices that are farther away & have weaker signals. The signal drops pretty quickly with distance. She's also not shown much reason to put faith in her keeping her side of any agreement. So, off the WiFi she must go!\n\nYou can either be passive aggressive & change the SSID & password on your WiFi. If she comes over to question it, you explain you got a new device or a new Internet provider & that's why the old WiFi went 'poof'. Or, you can be honest-aggressive & just tell her she was making your WiFi unusable. \n\nYou *could* give her advance notice, but still NTA if you don't. They have mobile data for urgent needs. Free WiFi is easy to find, even in smaller towns. If you're in a city of any size, there are libraries & other places where you can use the WiFi for $0.", "NTA\n\nI think you should just be honest though. Just explain that you need fast internet to wfh and that it is affecting your roommates as well.", "NTA", "YWNBTA. I get that she seems to be struggling but it's not your responsibility to provide her family with internet access. It's up to you if you want to be nice and give her a deadline or if you just do it immediately but either way you've already let it go on long enough and she's taking advantage now.", "NTA - you gave her something for free to help her out, she has no claim nor any right to your WiFi, especially as she is not helping in paying for it. I can understand the guilt for cutting off the WiFi, but this person clearly has no intention of sorting out their WiFi since they have SEVEN devices on it. Two I can understand, three is stretching it, but this just shows they have no intention of getting their own cause they can use yours. \n\nThe neighbour won't change as long as you are enabling them, they need to learn they cannot always survive off of the grace others. She's abused the kind gesture you offered with no form or repayment or return.\n\nIf you don't want to cut her off completely then cut her off and wait for her to come to you, if she sends her children then she's definitely abusing your kind gesture and using them to gain sympathy, if she comes then explain your are willing to let her use one or two devices that she clears with you for the next month which should be enough to get WiFi installed, if more than the set number appears, then she's abusing your offer.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou could bring up these exact issues with Anna and give her two options: either finally get that electrician to show up or pitch in $20 /month (or whatever amount) to use the wifi. I think you have been more than accommodating to your neighbor and her kids. Reading into the situation with some generosity, she might just think that everything is fine or may be ashamed of her situation. Cutting her off suddenly will definitely make things awkward, so an open conversation should be attempted first. I find that people are usually receptive to a kind confrontation and if she isn't then at least you tried :) Hope it works out!", "NTA. Just set her an ultimatum: If she does not get her own wifi within 1 month, she'll be cut off, for the very legitimate reason that her devices slow down yours while you are the one paying for it. Trouble getting an electrician in for months is BS, she just prefers to parasitize on you.", "NTA -- you have every right to change your password and not give her the new one. You've already gone above & beyond what you're morally obligated to do.\n\nIf you still want to help her, why not ask her to pay for the upgraded service? That would be reasonable -- your service could be slow because of all of her connected devices, so ask her to pay the difference. But if you think that getting even a small amount of money from her for this would turn into a problem, it might not be worth doing. But \"our Internet has gotten really slow & we can't have so many devices hooked up to it anymore\" is NOT a bad reason to stop sharing!", "YWNBTA. It sounds like you're being taken advantage of. Tell he neighbour that you are changing your service and can't lend it out any longer. Advance warning that freeloading time is over will hopefully prompt her to sort her own connection out. If she reacts poorly, all the more reason to put your foot down.", "NTA. This is a good example of when you give someone an inch, they take a mile. You gave her and her kids access to your wifi out of the kindness of your heart. Her inconsideration of your use of the service that you pay for is disappointing. She should have her own wifi by now and if she isn\u2019t able to afford it, then that is a situation that she has to address, not you. It\u2019s ridiculous that seven of their devices are on the wifi. She most likely planned this from the start and if you decide to cut them off the wifi, just remember that it was her overuse of the wifi and the disregard for your service experience that led you to make that decision.", "NTA \n\nIt is kind and considerate of you to help her being that she's a single mom and you were raised by one. You make your mom proud. However, kindness only go so far. Someone start mooching off, even worse hindering you and your roommate's ability to work efficiently with lagging wifi. How is it fair to your roommate(s) who are paying ? Do they all agree to this ? \n\nShe play you well by using her child to come to you with a phone (likely hers) to get a password. She know your soft spot. Please stop enabling that behavior as she is a shitty parent for sending her child to beg from you while she does not have the decency to come ask as an adult. She never intend to get wifi in the first place or change her mind to not get one since you give it out for charity.\n\nFree wifi exist in library, Starbucks, every public places nowadays. Her child will not fall behind education if they don't have wifi at home.", "NTA\n\nShe's using you. Someone who has 7 devices HAS the money for her wifi, it's clearly not a problem the engineer not coming but her not even asking for a wifi installation.\n\nChange pw. Your work is more important than those children internet connection.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t bother chatting with her about it or giving her a deadline to get hers sorted. You\u2019ve made some friendly gestures which weren\u2019t reciprocated so it\u2019s obvious she\u2019s using you not wanting to be friends. I would just change the PW and go about your day. If she comes knocking, \u201cSorry our wifi is just for us. You\u2019ve had sufficient time to get yours sorted and we can\u2019t let you use ours anymore.\u201d Or something a little more oblivious \u201cOh I didn\u2019t realize you still had devices logged into our network. Well now that they\u2019re logged out, it\u2019ll be easier for you to change them over to your network. Bye.\u201d She\u2019ll either accept without making a fuss or more likely lay on a sob story. Don\u2019t provide any excuses that she can guilt trip you with. Just a simple, \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mind letting you use ours while you were getting yours setup. You\u2019ve had plenty of time to do so and we won\u2019t be letting you use our network anymore.\u201d If she sends her kids, learn to say no. \u201cSorry but no I can\u2019t give it to you.\u201d", "YWNBTA. my mom was a single mom, too, and she would just tell me to read a book if we didn't have wifi. Anna could at least offer to give you some money (even a few dollars a month would be nice) for using your wifi. I get times are hard but... She's mooching.", "NTA - cut her off. And update us :D", "\"Single Parent' is not  a discount code. I'd give her some notice, and stick to that date. Once it rolls around, change your network name and password.", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe her anything. So she\u2019s a single mom. Maybe how she mooches off of other people is part of the reason why. If your roommates help pay for the internet, it wasn\u2019t fair of you to give her access in the first place. Change the password and get to know people before helping them with something like this.", "NTA, you can decide whether or not to tell her. Her family\u2019s use is causing you a hardship and interfering with your work. She had it good while it lasted. Change that password. Tell her if you feel guilty (?) but she doesn\u2019t need 2- weeks notice.", "No contracts made, nta", "YWNBTA - time to cut her loose. Change the password, and if she asks for it, give her the old one and play dumb - you don\u2019t know why it doesn\u2019t work for her - maybe she get her a/c sorted?", "NTA.  Personally, you don't owe her any explanation or your own \"well, I need it for\" sob story. NOTHING you say will one up her \"I'm a single Mom and life is hard\" ace card. Just cut it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you don't have the demeanor to just cut her off, then get \"petty\" and simply throttle the bandwidth on all 7 of those devices and when she comes to complain, you say \"I'll have an engineer come over and take a look\" and then just don't.  After a while she will either move on to another sucker or stop using your wifi because they are getting 14.4K old school MODEM data rates which makes it practically useless for gaming/streaming and browsing will be SLOW.", "NTA. Tell her the truth, which is you are having buffering issues and that you need tor deuce the number of devices on the network. 7 devices is taking the piss.", "NTA\n\nYou have been more than fair, and it is time to cut them off.  Guarantee they will get someone in less than a week.", "NTA. Best to be upfront with them and say the additional devices are hindering your needs. The only other thing to do if you wanted cut them off without actually cutting them off is to check in the network so in settings and block their devices from the internet. Should still show them as being connected to your network but won\u2019t let them work. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really odd it\u2019s stopped working for you, I\u2019ll look into it and re-start the router to se e if that helps. Have you still not been able to get an engineer?!?\u201d", "NTA. And I disagree with giving notice. Any misbehaviour they do will point back to you. Do you really want to risk it? Cut her off then tell her your wifi has gone down, too. Then a while later let her know you\u2019ve had someone out and they have let you know that the system can\u2019t handle the load it was under, so unfortunately you can\u2019t let her back on as your job is at risk. \u201cTerribly sorry, I know it sucks, but hopefully you\u2019ll be able to get a rush on your engineer and they\u2019ll be able to get you online quickly.\u201d \n\nAlso, it\u2019s ok to say no to a child. They are grifting you at this point, using the child for emotional manipulation. It would have been fine to be generous, admirable even, but they are taking advantage of your niceness. Saying no does not make you a bad person.", "NTA.\n\nChoose guilt over resentment, every time.", "Yes you would be If you lie to her about it. If you go straight to her and tell her she has a week to get her net set up cause y\u2019all are changing the password then no.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I suspect she may got a sob story about getting a tech out, but enough is enough. When you have devices at a distance, it slows down the speed for devices right next to the antenna- especially on most older stuff cable companies use in the US.

Or even that there is SO much genuine need out there that you need to work out what you're happy to donate to others in need and where you have to draw the line. I lived in London and I *had* to learn to say 'no' even when there looked to be genuine need. I didn't earn much and there is a bottomless pit of homeless people, people in need and people hustling for extra money who will lie and cheat to get more. You'd need to be Jeff Bezos to say yes and be kind to everyone who asks.\n\nIt'll hurt and you'll feel really bad for a while but, as an adult in the modern world, learning to say 'no' to those who *claim* they need it is an essential survival skill.", "Absolutely.

And don't give her gifts or offer to babysit, she will take advantage of you even more.  I get the single mom deal, did it with 3 sons and I worked extra shifts all the time to make ends meet.  I never asked anyone for a freebie of any sort.  If I needed a last minute favor, I always paid it back (ie: I would babysit, give someone a ride, pick up groceries - so many ways to \"give back\").  She is USING you and will continue to do so if you don't step up now.", "Nta - it\u2019s no longer a favour and she\u2019s now taking advantage.", "Definitely NTA but you really need to stop allowing yourself and your roommates to foot the bill for this leech since she is a prime example of why people are so reluctant to help others. If she can afford 7 devices, she can afford her own Wi-Fi. At this point, you're just enabling her to not correct her behavior. And when you change the password, there is no reason to have to explain anything to her-she should know it is coming.", "NTA. Change the wifi name to freerideisover(housenumberorlastname) and cut her off.", "It is best to be straightforward and honest.  \"You have so many devices on our Wi-Fi that we are having problems completing the work our jobs require. We can't continue to let you use our Wi-Fi.  You'll have to have someone come out and fix yours.\"", "Change the wifi name to \u201cNo_More_Leeches\u201d and change the password.\nNTA.", "NTA.  Cut her off now.  She's using you.  Let her pay for her own. She's acting entitled and teaching her children to be leeches.", "cut her off  change password", "I used to share my wifi with my neighbors, but my router allows for 2 channels, so I gave them the password for the slower network and used the fast one for myself. In exchange, I got an ad-free Hulu password and my yard mowed.\n\nThey've since gotten their own service, but it usually wasn't a big deal. OP's neighbor is definitely taking advantage of them.\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA, cut her off now. You don't owe her anything.", "NTA- although if she offered to chip in, ask her for the extra $20/month for the upgrade and limit her to 3 devices.", "Nta whatever you decided to do.\n\nYou could always give them a cut off date to get it sorted or tell them you notice or just change the password. Either way it is preventing you from doing work you are well within your right to take it back.", "NTA. You don\u2019t need an engineer for Wi-Fi. You can order one to your house and set it up yourself in 5 minutes. Wi-Fi isn\u2019t complicated.", "NTA, but this woman is clearly using you and your sympathies for her kids.  \n\nIf you really want to tell her that you're cutting her off from your wi-fi, that's your choice.  But I have a feeling you're going to end up having her scream in your face that \"you're depriving children of the internet,\" or \"I need it for my kids,\" and cutting her off anyway.\n\nAlso, if there's any screaming or entitlement from her, you might want to keep an eye out for revenge or backlash from her.", "NTA. But have you considered offering to split the total cost of the upgraded internet with her? You\u2019re not wrong if you don\u2019t want to though.", "No it wouldn't.\n\nThis person has been using OP's connection for free for literally months. It takes a couple days to get residential internet activated and installed, as a general rule.\n\nThere's no excuse for it not to be done by now, other than the neighbor not bothering to do it.", "\"mean move to just cut it off with no warning\" - WTH? It's not like she is paying towards the bill or anything. And remember, she has been told it is messing up the access of the folks who actually ARE paying for it-far as I'm concerned, that was her warning. Heck, she's probably amazed it hasn't been cut off long before this!", "Also, change the name of the NETWORK and at the same time HIDE it so it isn't visible to her.   She'll believe it if she can't see any network to link to.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen tell her you're using the phone data to do office work in the interim!", "If you have all those devices, you can afford your own internet plan. lol", "No, that's when you say, yeah with all the added devices we've noticed this too. When can you get your own service so we can enjoy ours at full capacity again?", "Not disagreeing with your verdict, just pointing out that her comment about the texts was on a different thread, not this one. We don't know if single mom is responding to OP or not.", "That was comment OP made on a different post.", "She probably has the roku, the nannycam and the ring doorbell on that thing!!!!\n\nI'd block her devices one by one.  Go into settings and do one a day.   Then tell her your router has a limit to the number of devices you can have operating and you're installing a security system.", "3 phones, a laptop for mom, a gaming console for each kid and maybe another laptop for school? It's not hard to reach 7 devices across 3 people without handing out passwords to visitors.", "Uh huh. That's how many were hooked up when OP checked. Doesn't mean more weren't hooked up at other times."]}
