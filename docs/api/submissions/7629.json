We all work as freelance creatives and don\u2019t earn loads. \n\nOur next door neighbour Anna (names changed obvs) moved in a few months ago. She has two small children (c8-10) and is a single mum. I was raised by a single mum and so obviously wanted to make sure she was okay, I said if she needed a hand settling in just to let us know. \n\nA week later she knocked on my door asking to use the Wi-Fi for her kids, saying she was having trouble getting the electrician in. Totally fine. \n\nA couple weeks pass, and we get a knock on the door and a child (her child) is standing there with a mobile asking for the password. I give it to him as I\u2019m not really going to say no to a child. \n\nA month or so passes, and we are having a few issues with the Wi-Fi. Nothing major, just buffering and stop and starts on zoom calls. But I work from home sometimes so need fast wifi. I texted Anna asking if she has got an electrician in (I know she hasn\u2019t as I can see she is connected, but as a gentle nudge). There are now seven additional devices on our Wi-Fi at this point. \n\nShe says she\u2019s still having issues getting an electrician in. Fine, whatever. It\u2019s around the holidays, I get it. \n\nFast forward to now, it\u2019s been nearly three months and no sign of an electrician, all her devices are currently using our Wi-Fi, and we are still having issues with speed. We could upgrade it to be faster, but it\u2019s about 20$ more a month. My roommate says just to cut her off and not say anything, but I feel bad doing that to a single mum.\n\nShe also has not attempted any kind of contact/friendship with us besides asking for the Wi-Fi, or asked to extend using it/offer to chip in for it. We have been friendly, given her a gift for Xmas and offered to babysit should she need (5+yrs experience doing this). \n\nWIBTA for just cutting it off/claiming we are having issues w it? TIA\n\nEdit for clarity: she said engineer, not electrician.

Saying she needs an electrician for wifi doesn't really make sense.", "NTA but I\u2019d let her know before you cut her off, and be really clear. \u201cHi neighbour, I\u2019ve been happy to share up till now but I really need my wifi to be clear for work going forward and your families use is impacting the connection. I\u2019m going to update the network so you won\u2019t be able to use it any further from [date] so you really need to get your electrician sorted.\u201d\nIf she is annoyed  after that\u2019s on her not you, but it would be a bit of a mean move to just cut it off with no warning and ghost her.", "NTA. She\u2019s milking you, charge her a fee or cut her off.", "NTA - sounds like you have been a lovely and very generous neighbor\n\nI think she is likely taking advantage. Why would you pay your own bill when you can use your neighbors for free? I do feel bad for her as money is likely tight but that doesn't make mooching ok and it's not fair on your household\n\nI would explain to her that you are going to have to stop her from using the WiFi because it is causing issues for your work. This would give her time to set up her own connection before you close off yours. Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think you need an electrician? So she should be able to get it sorted quickly\n\nYou are in no way obliged to do this but the idea of being stuck in a house with two kids whos tablets suddenly don't work is nightmarish \ud83d\ude02. You would be doing her (another!) favor", "NTA - your neighbor is obviously abusing your generosity.", "NTA - Not at all. You did a kind thing for someone and they have clearly been taking advantage of you. Cut and dry.\n\nI know it would be awkward but I'd think about changing the password and just leaving her a note letting her know you did so. This isn't at all necessary but addresses the feeling you worry about. You can empathize (and you clearly have) without letting yourself get taken advantage of. Everyone will survive for a week without internet access until they get their own.", "YWNBTA. You're too kind OP. She's taking advantage of it.", "NTA - but have a conversation with her! If your internet is working better now with the upgrade maybe you can ask her to pay the $20 extra a month. That would save her a ton of money setting up her own. If she says no or gets upset than just change the passwords and downgrade the internet.", "NTA. Cut her off and tell her you cant fund it anymore and that she's had ample time to sort it out. Don't lie to her and don't worry about sparing her feelings - she's not shy with mooching off you.", "Well, here it is. The AITA I was born to address.\n\nFirst off, NTA for cutting her off. I'm not sure where you are, but I really doubt it takes 3 months to get Internet in a place where the house next door is already wired. You don't really want to pursue a compromise where she pays extra for you to increase your speed, because that may not even fix the problem. WiFi speed tends to be made slower by devices that are farther away & have weaker signals. The signal drops pretty quickly with distance. She's also not shown much reason to put faith in her keeping her side of any agreement. So, off the WiFi she must go!\n\nYou can either be passive aggressive & change the SSID & password on your WiFi. If she comes over to question it, you explain you got a new device or a new Internet provider & that's why the old WiFi went 'poof'. Or, you can be honest-aggressive & just tell her she was making your WiFi unusable. \n\nYou *could* give her advance notice, but still NTA if you don't. They have mobile data for urgent needs. Free WiFi is easy to find, even in smaller towns. If you're in a city of any size, there are libraries & other places where you can use the WiFi for $0.", "NTA\n\nI think you should just be honest though. Just explain that you need fast internet to wfh and that it is affecting your roommates as well.", "NTA", "YWNBTA. I get that she seems to be struggling but it's not your responsibility to provide her family with internet access. It's up to you if you want to be nice and give her a deadline or if you just do it immediately but either way you've already let it go on long enough and she's taking advantage now.", "NTA - you gave her something for free to help her out, she has no claim nor any right to your WiFi, especially as she is not helping in paying for it. I can understand the guilt for cutting off the WiFi, but this person clearly has no intention of sorting out their WiFi since they have SEVEN devices on it. Two I can understand, three is stretching it, but this just shows they have no intention of getting their own cause they can use yours. \n\nThe neighbour won't change as long as you are enabling them, they need to learn they cannot always survive off of the grace others. She's abused the kind gesture you offered with no form or repayment or return.\n\nIf you don't want to cut her off completely then cut her off and wait for her to come to you, if she sends her children then she's definitely abusing your kind gesture and using them to gain sympathy, if she comes then explain your are willing to let her use one or two devices that she clears with you for the next month which should be enough to get WiFi installed, if more than the set number appears, then she's abusing your offer.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou could bring up these exact issues with Anna and give her two options: either finally get that electrician to show up or pitch in $20 /month (or whatever amount) to use the wifi. I think you have been more than accommodating to your neighbor and her kids. Reading into the situation with some generosity, she might just think that everything is fine or may be ashamed of her situation. Cutting her off suddenly will definitely make things awkward, so an open conversation should be attempted first. I find that people are usually receptive to a kind confrontation and if she isn't then at least you tried :) Hope it works out!", "NTA. Just set her an ultimatum: If she does not get her own wifi within 1 month, she'll be cut off, for the very legitimate reason that her devices slow down yours while you are the one paying for it. Trouble getting an electrician in for months is BS, she just prefers to parasitize on you.", "NTA -- you have every right to change your password and not give her the new one. You've already gone above & beyond what you're morally obligated to do.\n\nIf you still want to help her, why not ask her to pay for the upgraded service? That would be reasonable -- your service could be slow because of all of her connected devices, so ask her to pay the difference. But if you think that getting even a small amount of money from her for this would turn into a problem, it might not be worth doing. But \"our Internet has gotten really slow & we can't have so many devices hooked up to it anymore\" is NOT a bad reason to stop sharing!", "YWNBTA. It sounds like you're being taken advantage of. Tell he neighbour that you are changing your service and can't lend it out any longer. Advance warning that freeloading time is over will hopefully prompt her to sort her own connection out. If she reacts poorly, all the more reason to put your foot down.", "NTA. This is a good example of when you give someone an inch, they take a mile. You gave her and her kids access to your wifi out of the kindness of your heart. Her inconsideration of your use of the service that you pay for is disappointing. She should have her own wifi by now and if she isn\u2019t able to afford it, then that is a situation that she has to address, not you. It\u2019s ridiculous that seven of their devices are on the wifi. She most likely planned this from the start and if you decide to cut them off the wifi, just remember that it was her overuse of the wifi and the disregard for your service experience that led you to make that decision.", "NTA \n\nIt is kind and considerate of you to help her being that she's a single mom and you were raised by one. You make your mom proud. However, kindness only go so far. Someone start mooching off, even worse hindering you and your roommate's ability to work efficiently with lagging wifi. How is it fair to your roommate(s) who are paying ? Do they all agree to this ? \n\nShe play you well by using her child to come to you with a phone (likely hers) to get a password. She know your soft spot. Please stop enabling that behavior as she is a shitty parent for sending her child to beg from you while she does not have the decency to come ask as an adult. She never intend to get wifi in the first place or change her mind to not get one since you give it out for charity.\n\nFree wifi exist in library, Starbucks, every public places nowadays. Her child will not fall behind education if they don't have wifi at home.", "NTA\n\nShe's using you. Someone who has 7 devices HAS the money for her wifi, it's clearly not a problem the engineer not coming but her not even asking for a wifi installation.\n\nChange pw. Your work is more important than those children internet connection.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t bother chatting with her about it or giving her a deadline to get hers sorted. You\u2019ve made some friendly gestures which weren\u2019t reciprocated so it\u2019s obvious she\u2019s using you not wanting to be friends. I would just change the PW and go about your day. If she comes knocking, \u201cSorry our wifi is just for us. You\u2019ve had sufficient time to get yours sorted and we can\u2019t let you use ours anymore.\u201d Or something a little more oblivious \u201cOh I didn\u2019t realize you still had devices logged into our network. Well now that they\u2019re logged out, it\u2019ll be easier for you to change them over to your network. Bye.\u201d She\u2019ll either accept without making a fuss or more likely lay on a sob story. Don\u2019t provide any excuses that she can guilt trip you with. Just a simple, \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mind letting you use ours while you were getting yours setup. You\u2019ve had plenty of time to do so and we won\u2019t be letting you use our network anymore.\u201d If she sends her kids, learn to say no. \u201cSorry but no I can\u2019t give it to you.\u201d", "YWNBTA. my mom was a single mom, too, and she would just tell me to read a book if we didn't have wifi. Anna could at least offer to give you some money (even a few dollars a month would be nice) for using your wifi. I get times are hard but... She's mooching.", "NTA - cut her off. And update us :D", "\"Single Parent' is not  a discount code. I'd give her some notice, and stick to that date. Once it rolls around, change your network name and password.", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe her anything. So she\u2019s a single mom. Maybe how she mooches off of other people is part of the reason why. If your roommates help pay for the internet, it wasn\u2019t fair of you to give her access in the first place. Change the password and get to know people before helping them with something like this.", "NTA, you can decide whether or not to tell her. Her family\u2019s use is causing you a hardship and interfering with your work. She had it good while it lasted. Change that password. Tell her if you feel guilty (?) but she doesn\u2019t need 2- weeks notice.", "No contracts made, nta", "YWNBTA - time to cut her loose. Change the password, and if she asks for it, give her the old one and play dumb - you don\u2019t know why it doesn\u2019t work for her - maybe she get her a/c sorted?", "NTA.  Personally, you don't owe her any explanation or your own \"well, I need it for\" sob story. NOTHING you say will one up her \"I'm a single Mom and life is hard\" ace card. Just cut it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you don't have the demeanor to just cut her off, then get \"petty\" and simply throttle the bandwidth on all 7 of those devices and when she comes to complain, you say \"I'll have an engineer come over and take a look\" and then just don't.  After a while she will either move on to another sucker or stop using your wifi because they are getting 14.4K old school MODEM data rates which makes it practically useless for gaming/streaming and browsing will be SLOW.", "NTA. Tell her the truth, which is you are having buffering issues and that you need tor deuce the number of devices on the network. 7 devices is taking the piss.", "NTA\n\nYou have been more than fair, and it is time to cut them off.  Guarantee they will get someone in less than a week.", "NTA. Best to be upfront with them and say the additional devices are hindering your needs. The only other thing to do if you wanted cut them off without actually cutting them off is to check in the network so in settings and block their devices from the internet. Should still show them as being connected to your network but won\u2019t let them work. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really odd it\u2019s stopped working for you, I\u2019ll look into it and re-start the router to se e if that helps. Have you still not been able to get an engineer?!?\u201d", "NTA. And I disagree with giving notice. Any misbehaviour they do will point back to you. Do you really want to risk it? Cut her off then tell her your wifi has gone down, too. Then a while later let her know you\u2019ve had someone out and they have let you know that the system can\u2019t handle the load it was under, so unfortunately you can\u2019t let her back on as your job is at risk. \u201cTerribly sorry, I know it sucks, but hopefully you\u2019ll be able to get a rush on your engineer and they\u2019ll be able to get you online quickly.\u201d \n\nAlso, it\u2019s ok to say no to a child. They are grifting you at this point, using the child for emotional manipulation. It would have been fine to be generous, admirable even, but they are taking advantage of your niceness. Saying no does not make you a bad person.", "NTA.\n\nChoose guilt over resentment, every time.", "Yes you would be If you lie to her about it. If you go straight to her and tell her she has a week to get her net set up cause y\u2019all are changing the password then no.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I suspect she may got a sob story about getting a tech out, but enough is enough. When you have devices at a distance, it slows down the speed for devices right next to the antenna- especially on most older stuff cable companies use in the US.

Or even that there is SO much genuine need out there that you need to work out what you're happy to donate to others in need and where you have to draw the line. I lived in London and I *had* to learn to say 'no' even when there looked to be genuine need. I didn't earn much and there is a bottomless pit of homeless people, people in need and people hustling for extra money who will lie and cheat to get more. You'd need to be Jeff Bezos to say yes and be kind to everyone who asks.\n\nIt'll hurt and you'll feel really bad for a while but, as an adult in the modern world, learning to say 'no' to those who *claim* they need it is an essential survival skill.", "Absolutely.

But if you'd like to get your own connection the provider we've been using is xxxxx\".", "Nta, she\u2019s taking advantage of you, there was never a technician coming to turn on the wifi at her place, change the password and move on", "NTA.  Just let her know that the additional usage is causing the wi-fi to slow down too much now.  Give her a week (and let her know) and then cut it off.  After three months of free wi-fi, why would she want to pay for it now?", "NTA.  Give her a chance to pay the 20.00 to upgrade if you're feeling sorry for her.  If she refuses, change the password and let her know.  At this time, she's causing you inconveniences, plus you've been more than fair.", "NTA but Anna is taking advantage of you.  Text/email her and tell her that the additional devices are causing issues and you need the bandwidth for work and that you'll be switching the password (maybe give her 24 hours notice).  No further explanations is necessary.  (Not sure what/how internet works in your country but here in the US you just call the internet provider and they come out and set it up).", "NAH.   Just explain it to her nicely and let her know that it's impacting your work.   If you don't mind keeping her on it just ask for the extra money  (up front) to upgrade.", "Yea literally all she needs is to sign up for internet service and plug in the router. That's like saying you need a mechanic to fill your car up with gas.", "If OP has a decent wifi router she can also setup a low bandwidth network or throttle certain devices.\n\nThen they are neither cut off and cannot impact her stuff through bandwidth issues, they just get spotty service and will likely complain to their mother.", "NO! Just cut them off. Hide the SSID/Change it and the password. No reason to justify anything.", "I was opting for blocking 6 out of the 7 devices above is better. If neighbour have temerity to complain just shrug and say you are also battling", "Better yet, say, \"Maybe when your engineer comes over, they can take a look at mine, too!\"", "Now required for howework.", "I really want to know how this will pan out too. I wonder if she is going to pull the \"I am a struggling single mom excuse\".", "This is the tech savvy solution that would have prevented OPs issue from the beginning.", ">NTA I think the idea of telling her the truth\u2014that her 7 devices are slowing down your internet to the point that it\u2019s interfering with your work\u2014is the best. I\u2019d tell her that you\u2019ll be changing your set up in one week, so she will need to make other arrangements.\n\nThis. Just be honest. A week is more than enough time to make other plans. She's taking advantage. Possible she has no idea it's slowing down your devices, but it is, it's interfering, and she isn't making her own arrangements.", "That's not how Wi-Fi works. Multiple devices would slow it down.", "I feel like its an AH thing to connect 7(!) devices to someone's network when they are generous enough to let you use it. This is very give an inch, take a mile situation.", "OP I wouldn't even say anything. Just change the password and then when they ask for it, say you are waiting for an electrician to come, and just keep saying that. 7 devices means its being used by her, her kids and probably whomever she has over there at all hours you don't know about since you are not on friendly terms.", "First of all NTA. To be fair, if i hook up my iphone to a wifi, my ipad, macbook and watch will all share the password and automatically attach too.", ">I'd just say change the password, and if she comes running about it, [...]\n\nI would say *\"We had a problem with the wifi and waiting for the engineer to come.\"* and keep saying this every time she or the kids ask(s). She lost every and any generosity with being a shameless leach. \n\nNTA OP doesn't owe her an explanation why they don't let her and her kids use the wifi, Internet they pay for for free (at all or anymore). She is not entitled to the neighbours' Internet. OP was a lot more generous than warranted. 1 or max 2 weeks is a nice thing to do but 3 months that's self-sabotage on OP's and OP's roommates' part. (OP, please, stop being a doormat!)", "OP wants her cake and to eat it too. She wants to help out single moms? She can't say no to a child but can't afford an extra 20 a month for better internet? \n\nPick a lane OP. Do you actually want to help people or do you just want the feeling of helping people without actually doing anything. Both options are good and neither makes you A-H in this situation to be clear though.", "I've had to teach my adult children that you don't need to give a reason. You can just say no.", "I didn't even know that could be done", "Well, it would be nice to at least tell them that it is intentional and not a technical glitch.", "Yeah, I was sent to the library or told to fake an answer", "[removed]", "> Just change the password and then when they ask for it, say you are waiting for an electrician to come\n\nOhh, I like you!", "Agreed. I mainly suggested the callback to her own words because people felt they should talk to her. I would just cut her off without a word, but leeches tend to come demanding what they feel is theirs.", ">This is why I love that my wife has guest access\n\nSorry, can you clarify what this even means? Does your spouse not have internet access in their own home?", "I don\u2019t think lanes need to be picked in this situation\u2026 why should OP pay \u00a320 more and the neighbor still not contribute to the cost? They already shared the network thinking the neighbor was going to use it temporarily, not forever for free\u2026\n\nHelping people does not have to be a \u201cgive your 110% and have no boundaries,\u201d despite the black and white thinking the internet perpetuates about helping thy neighbor.", "Some cheap routers that you get for free from your ISP dont have options for it other than like a guest network setting, but most midtier and up devices support doing that per device or limiting by traffic type", "I wouldn't, but then again I wouldn't be making a Reddit post about it either. Obviously this person feels some kind of way about it so people are suggesting a compromise.", ">How spineless are you?\n\nIt's been 3 months and OP's roommates (who actually pay for the Internet use) already told her to just change the password and yet here she is asking on Reddit wheter it would be a bad thing to do, if it would make her a bad person in this situation.... I would say, probably, OP is pretty spineless. Probably even with giving notice she would feel like she did something very bad... \n\nBut OP fails to realise that with her current behaviour (not cutting off that leach already) she is being a bad roommate. She is making not just her own job but the others' job harder too, unnecessarily, with the overburdened wifi, and she is inconveniencing her roommates when they want to use the Internet in their leisure time too.", "By \"wifi\", she may very well mean \"internet connection\". And by \"electrician\", she may mean \"the person from the internet provider\".", "I was amazed at how classist the public education had become. At least their handing out chromebooks.. but to believe everyone has internet.\n\nWhen I was a kid, some kids in school didn't have food or warmth, or in some cases floors.", "Downvote and report. /u/Adoretru is a bot and stole this comment from /u/betterGrabATissueBox", "It was a typo probably. They meant their wifi router has a guest access feature.", "This means the wife has basically two networks in her home, one of them is a guest network (probably with reduced bandwidth/functions) which is only available when there are guests over.\n\nI set it up this way in my home as well. I can only recommend having a guest network. The guest network is only switched on, when we have guests over and they can log on with the credentials which we put on our fridge. When there are no guests over this network is switched off.", "Oops i meant Wi-Fi guest access. When I have guests, I can turn on the guest Wi-Fi and give them that password and then shut it off when no one should be using it. It allows my primary Wi-Fi to only be my devices."]}
