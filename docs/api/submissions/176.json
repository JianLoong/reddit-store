If I was your friend, I'd think you pocketed the watch yourself.", "YTA. If you didn't want to be responsible for transporting the prodicts you shouldn't have agreed to do that.", "YTA. You are responsible for the item from the time it got delivered to you to the time you deliver it to its rightful owner. If the watch went missing or was damaged while in your custody, you should replace it. Now, if you get back to the States and find that you just forgot to pack it\u2026 send him the watch and get reimbursed. But if your buddy is out $800 because you were careless and you refuse to cover the loss\u2026 that\u2019s major AH territory. \n\nThis whole thing is a bit sketch.", "INFO: Had your friend paid you in advance to buy the watch?\n\nIf yes, YTA for not paying them back.", "If they sent you money and you bought the items, then you owe him the money. Even if you didn't mean to, you essentially stole his money.\n\nIf they ordered the items and they were shipped to your house, like, they have the receipts, not you, then you were just a free shipping service. I don't know how much you owe him then. Basically you failed to do him a favor. Personally, I think when you ask someone to do you a favor, you incur the risk and you shouldn't demand restitution. However, it looks on the surface like you stole the watch.", "INFO\n\nDid YOU lose the Apple Watch after it was delivered to you? Or did you never receive the Apple Watch to begin with? \n\nIf it was delivered to you and YOU lost it, Y T A.\n\nIf it was never delivered to you, and this was an error on your friend's part or Apple's part, N T A.", "I question the legality of this, but yes YTA. If it's illegal activity ESH.\n\nYou're responsible for transportation, you failed your responsibility, you need to make up for your failure.", "50/50? You should be paying him the full amount. Your friend is very generous.\n\nYou agreed to take their money and buy them stuff. You weren't forced to. You took on a responsibility to do so on your own accord, and that comes with the responsibility of actually getting the stuff and bringing it to them. Otherwise you're just conning them.\n\nAnd you lost it.  You made him lose all that money, and when he's asking you to split 50/50, you're refusing even that, even though he's literally giving you 50% of the money for free in that case just so he wouldn't have to lose 100% of it on nothing?\n\nSpecially considering that the watch might still be back at your place in US.\n\nYTA. Wtf bro", "YTA. Why is this a question? You took responsibility of the product and your friend trusted you to give them the item. If you lost it then that\u2019s on you and you should reimburse that.", ">I didn\u2019t know what to do but I realized that I had nothing to gain from bringing him the items, so I should have nothing to lose as well and he should be bearing all the risks.\n\n\n\n\nYou aren\u2019t just responsible for things you are paid to do.

If you're willing to help a friend, agree upfront that if there are issues, you will split the fee. Then they can decide whether to use your support or not. But be aware that they may not want to help you out either.\n\nBut right now, your friend is due their money back and it was your fault.", "YTA. Your friend gave you money and trusted you to exchange that money for a product. No idea how you supposedly lost the product, but your friend should get one or the other. You really sound like you're being defensive and making excuses.", "YTA. You agreed to this arrangement and you lost a really expensive item. Once you agreed, you took responsibility. If all the items arrived to you ok, how were you so blas\u00e9 as to lose the watch? If I was responsible for items that expensive, I\u2019d be checking them every 5 minutes to make sure they're all there. \nIf your friend is only asking for 50/50, you have incredibly generous friends!", "ESH - This is illegal activity.", "YTA.  You're basically a smuggler for your friends.", "It really is just see that simple!", "YTA. You agreed to bring it. You didn\u2019t bring it.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to assume this responsibility, don\u2019t agree to do this for anyone again.\n\nDid you leave it behind? Did you lose it on the way? Have you since worked out what happened?", "YTA. He paid. You lost it. Now you\u2019re responsible for either the item or the money. \n\nThis is why most people don\u2019t accept huge amounts of money to deliver products unless they have insurance for lost/stolen products - like a store does.", "Yta- for him, you could have just taken their money and not bought the watch. Even if you did and it was a genuine mistake, you lost it and your friend is $800 down because of your actions. Pay them. Also, legally, you\u2019d lose if he decided to pursue it.", "NTA. They should have had the product insured. Lesson learned.", "How would you feel if the roles were reversed? \n\nYTA", "40% import taxes is a theft. It doesn't matter if it's legal. This kind of practice is common in countries with high taxes. I speak from experience."]}
