I sent him a text that I was sorry for saying that but we're just trying to make him see sense.

I'm genuinely upset reading this, because it reminded me of me.\n\nThis is going to be long but I want to give OP some perspective. I started off in college majoring in biology, to eventually become a dentist. I didn't want to and it wasn't my thing at all, but my dad insisted this was the best option for me and I didn't have the backbone to say no. I graduated with said biology degree, got my DMD, and worked as a dentist for almost three years, and my family was very proud of me.\n\nI love art and literature. I got a very similar talk to what you told your son, that studying this will get me nowhere and I'll be a failure. I was part of a writing club as a teen and wrote scripts for the local theater group, but stopped because my parents thought I was wasting my time.\n\nAfter many years in a subject/profession I didn't care for, my fiance encouraged me to start living for myself and not to please my family, and I've gone back to school to get my English degree. Is it as \"prestigious\" and \"high paying\" as being a dentist? No, but that's subjective and I've learnt happiness is the greatest form of wealth. My parents aren't as proud as they were before, which hurts a bit, but that's okay.\n\nThe difference between me and your son though is that he actually stood up to say \"no, I don't want to do x subject because I don't like it, and I prefer y subject\".\n\nTelling him he's going to be a failure, and not to come to you **when** (you didn't even say if, you said **when**) he fails is awful OP. How do you know he'll fail? Is it because he fails in you and your husband's eyes, because his degree/future job won't be prestigious enough? I do agree robotics would probably lead to more career options, but let him make this decision.\n\nIn my opinion, a parent's job when their kid becomes an adult is to support them through their choices, unless they're making extremely bad decisions but this isn't the case here. Your son is still young and plenty of students switch majors in college, it's not a big deal. It's better than wasting years in something he hates.\n\nIf you want to do better, give your son the space he needs, then talk to him and tell him you support him, and he can come to you if he needs to. Even if your son fails at getting a fancy job, don't let yourself fail at being a parent.", "yta. You told him not to come to you so he will not come to you.", "YTA.\n\n\"Am I an asshole for being an asshole to my son?\"\n\nOf course you fucking are. \n\nThe English language is amazing, and there are an almost limitless number of ways you could have had a conversation with him about his choice, but instead you opted for:\n\n>not to come to us when he fails.\n\nHow about he not bother coming to you for anything at in future. Seems like he's already got a head start on doing just that.", "YTA - Your apology wasn't sincere.  It was another attempt to dig your point in.  He's still wanting to be a contributing member of society, and you want to poop on his dream.  You're telling him that money is more important than being happy.", "YTA - I mean, I agree with you that robotics likely would lead to an easier career path for him, especially since he seems to be doing well. But sometimes kids need to learn through failure. And who knows, maybe he will go on to be a great lawyer or do something else in the public policy realm that will make him much happier. Regardless of whether this works out for him, insinuating that you will abandon your child over what you perceive to be a poor decision is incredibly damaging to the relationship, and it may take him a long time to forgive you.", "But we're just trying to make him see that we think he'll be happy making more money and we don't really care if he's actually happy. Who should know better about what would make him happy, him or us? YTA\n\nETA - and it's not like he's dropping out to draw caricatures on the boardwalk. (Not that there's anything wrong with that if it makes you happy.) He's just changing majors!", "YTA, a very prestigious one. \n\n> I was sorry for saying that but we're just trying to make him see sense.\n\nThat's so sweet. I'm also sorry for saying you're a prestigious asshole, but I'm just trying to make it make sense. If you fail to make sense of it, don't come to us.", "YTA. It's fucked up that we use money as a measure of success in life and you're perpetuating that. Beyond that, you're not supporting your child in learning to do something they care about instead of something they probably originally chose to please you.", "YTA \n\nGreat job of supporting your son unconditionally! Wow, you'll be so proud of him when he graduates. Too bad he'll have gone NC before that, though! Oh, well. Hopefully, you had  found out that he graduated from mutual friends or something. Congratulations!", "YTA. When your son didn't agree to do what you wanted, you resorted to emotional abuse.", "YTA and you have 100% failed as a parent as well as just a being a kind human.", "YTA for thinking your son is unable to make a decision about his future and to work through it towards success. You basically told him not only that his choices are wrong, but also that he is absolutely going to fail and that there is no chance at all that you will support him through his decisions, even if he ultimately ends up needing help. Talk about having reasons for sulking.", "YTA - why are you assuming he\u2019s going to fail if so far he\u2019s done well in life? If he\u2019s doing well in is current course why wouldn\u2019t he continue to do well at something he\u2019s excited about? Your reasoning and explanation makes no sense. Support your son and apologize. Try learning why he\u2019s so passionate and see how you can encourage him so he doesn\u2019t fail", "YTA\n\nYou tried to use fear tactics and your kid is now old enough and smart enough to see through your BS.", "YTA what you said and did was cruel and somewhat manipulative.\n\nUsing fear tactics to get him to do what you want him to do and pursue something he really wants to do.\n\nSaying \u201cdon\u2019t come to us when you fail\u201d your basically saying you think he\u2019s going to fail. Also you\u2019re saying \u201cwe are only interested in you if you\u2019re successful and rich\u201d\n\nHave you considered he might succeed, sure he might not make loads of money but he will feel fulfilled in his career choice.", "First off\u2026 success is not always connected to high paying prestige jobs. Second off\u2026 the fact he wants political science and public policy now in these current turbulent times is incredibly admirable. With so much of the country\u2019s ills being because of the deification of the almighty dollar and the corruption that is everywhere because if it ( and the imbalance of power), his wanting to get involved in a real way is special, admirable and incredibly important. Your rejecting him because he is (in your mind) going to be less successful because you personally don\u2019t value his chosen field is heartbreaking. You should be so proud. Instead\u2026 you reject him and already have told him he will fail.  Yes\u2026 YTA. Please wake up and apologize before you lose both he and your appropriately career acceptable (to you) daughter. The world needs more people like him.", "YTA. I guess your son having a prestigious job is more important to you than his happiness. While not my cup of tea, I'm guessing you don't consider working for a politician prestigious enough? Hell chances are slim, but he might become the press secretary for a future president or work for the UN. I hope he goes NC/LC with you.", "YTA. You\u2019ve essentially told him he\u2019s going to fail anyway and have no faith in him or care about his happiness by changing his education to something he\u2019s interested in.", "YTA. How terrible to tell your son he's going to fail. You owe him an apology.", "YTA why would you ever discourage your child from pursuing their passion? Maybe, unlike you, he realizes that there are more important things in life than prestige and money.", "YTA. Congrats on showing your son that 1) you measure his value based on his job prospects  2) that his happiness matters less to you than his earning potential and 3) that you think he\u2019s somehow incapable of succeeding in any field apart from those you and your spouse have okayed. I\u2019m glad Zara\u2019s also mad at you and your husband.", "You aren't wrong that he is going to have a hard time finding a job (a job period, not just a good paying job.  The job market is flooded with political science majors rn).\n\nBut YTA for number 1. The way you approached the subject (don't come to me when you fail?  Really?) \n\nAnd number 2. You should never discourage your child from pursing their passion.\n\nIt is better for them to be happy and poor then be rich and hate going to work every day because they continued on with a degree and eventually a job that they didn't enjoy/weren't passionate about.", "YTA, I shouldn't even have to explain why, you know why", "YTA with the blunt response, even if it is a possibility that he will fail. \n\nIf it was a reoccurring thing where he continued to make poor choices and you and your husband were having to bail him out and support him over and over again, I could see that response. \n\nHowever it looks like up to this point he\u2019s been doing pretty well with his prior choices so there was really nothing to warrant the \u201cDon\u2019t bother coming to us it bites you in the ass\u201d mentality. \n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if he ends up distancing himself from you guys now. Just because you\u2019re family doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s obligated to forgive and forget. I cut my mother off years ago and have never been happier.", "YTA, Both you and your husband. Good job letting him know that your support (and probably love) is conditional.", "YTA. Not everyone prioritizes a high paying and prestigious job. Some people just want to be happy.", "YTA. Your mad your adult son is doing something he wants vs what you want, so instead of doing what parents (and decent humans for that matter) do and support and love him (regardless of your opinion... Which he didnt ask for) you use fear tactics and threaten to pull your support. Way to go. Even Jeffrey Dahmer's dad went to see him in prison.", "You\u2019re holding your support for your own son hostage to manipulate him into the career path of your choosing. YTA. Support your son or just do him a favor and cut him off entirely.", "\"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness\" is a well-known phrase from the United States Declaration of Independence. Unfortunately, many parents do not care about their children\u2019s pursuit of happiness. They plan everything for their children including the profession they\u2019re supposed to pursue because of monetary rewards. GREED obscured their common sensibilities. When kids realize that they\u2019re not happy or suited to their parents\u2019 chosen profession, and pursue that which they thought is best for themselves, these parents go nuts. OP- you should have asked AWTA? You and your husband are not only assholes, you\u2019re destroying your child\u2019s life and future. Why not study robotics yourselves? - yes the 2 of you? You\u2019re still young and can be actual robots when you graduate.", "YTA so you don\u2019t want you son to do something he enjoys, you want him in a miserable but high paying job. That\u2019s fkd up. I hope when he succeeds he leaves y\u2019all to a nursing home.", "Absolutely YTA. That was horrible. Cruel. And permanently damaging. \nNow your condemning prophecy of failure on something he,  an adult,  found passion for,  will be in his head.  And if he dwells on it he might fail when he wouldn't have.  And if he does,  you have broken his spirit. \nYou have a limited time to do damage control.  But he will be bitter. And rightfully so", "Maybe he doesn't want a high paying prestigious job! Wouldn't it be better that he be happy in his career? Are you always this controlling? YTA for being straight up nasty to him and trying to influence his life! You already lived your life, let him have his!", "YTA - Why do you think political science will end up with him not having a career? I know lots of people with poly sci degrees that work in various fields. I've met plenty working in DC for elected officials.", "YTA. \"Sulking for no reason,\" he found out what he wanted to do in life, and his parents were not only supportive but threatened to not even be there for him if he struggles a little bit.\n\nHe has plenty of reason to be upset, and I wouldn't even bother answering your texts for a long time.", "YTA\n\nYou're more concerned with him finding a good paying job than him being able to do something he's passionate about. If he can't come to you when he fails you aren't allowed to ask anything of him when he succeeds.\nOn another note any parent that says \"don't come to me when you fail\" is an AH. Your kids *should* be able to come to you to talk and lament when they fail, life is trial and error.", "YTA\n\nOf course he's mad. He has parents who don't support him unless he makes choices they agree with. I could see that if his choices were hookers and blow, but if the guy wants to take a different academic path, you've got no business being discouraging. It's literally his life he's deciding here. Your perception of what will make the most money is not necessarily what will make him happy.", "YTA.", "YTA. That\u2019s an awful thing to say. Imagine hearing from your own parents that they don\u2019t care what happens to you.", "YTA!\n\nAs a parent, I would never tell my kids they couldn't come back home if they were struggling.

Social sciences teach data analysis that can be really useful and highly employable. He probably should go to grad school, but it\u2019s not a useless degree. And policy specifically is a growing field that can open a lot of doors. Also if he wants to get a PhD he can get one for free!\n\nAnyway, YTA.", "YTA. Why not just support your son?

Sharing my own story here for reference: I had a Chinese mom and grew up experiencing a bit of the \u201cTiger Parent\u201d parenting stereotype. I\u2019d loved writing and visual art since I was very young, but my parents always dismissed those passions as petty hobbies and instead pushed me toward everything STEM (which I admittedly didn\u2019t hate and did have an aptitude for). Come college I was basically told I could choose any major, so long as it was engineering.\n\nFast forward five years, during which I switched my B.S. field from CS to mechanical engineering and clawed my way to the finish line in 2021 - on time, no less, even though my parents (still not satisfied with my love of the arts, despite me caving to their demands major-wise) abandoned me and left me to fend entirely for myself, financially and otherwise, at the end of freshman year. I didn\u2019t go into industry but did get a job managing a fairly prestigious engineering graduate research lab. I hated every minute of it.\n\nFor my sanity, I quit that job late last year and serendipitously snagged a full-time job in copywriting alongside a \u201cfor fun\u201d part-time gig with a consultancy firm at the same time. It\u2019s night and day. I can\u2019t exaggerate how much better these new positions have been on every front. They\u2019re flexible and remote; the supes and staff are insanely nice and compassionate, unlike my crotchety, demanding Successful STEM Man stereotype of a previous boss; and I get PAID MORE, by a long shot. Yes, really! And I got these new jobs pretty much entirely on the merit of being a strong writer (demonstrated via my personal portfolio and some short test tasks I completed during my interview processes), and in spite of my degree having nothing to do with writing or any of the responsibilities listed in my current positions.\n\nThe point is this: My love of writing has been so unwavering throughout my life that despite spending almost all my time in college earning a degree in a totally unrelated field at my parents\u2019 behest - even though I was forbidden from pursuing writing and the arts in any academic capacity - I managed to keep it up and prove myself worthy of a bona fide professional writing position, and a successful one at that.\n\nWe know, in our hearts, what we love. We know what we\u2019re good at. And one way or another, it is very likely we\u2019ll find our way back to that path, no matter how hard you try to contempt it. \n\n(I mean, not always! Sometimes we guess and we guess wrong. We\u2019re young. But at the very least you owe your child the trust and respect of letting them choose. If it turns out they\u2019ve made a mistake, so be it; that happens, and it is part of life to live and learn. Plus, your son sounds smart and resourceful - even mistakes probably won\u2019t turn out badly for him.)\n\nSomething I recall that has always stuck with me is when, during college essay submission season, my dad was looking over my work and said, \u201cShe can\u2019t write worth a damn.\u201d Mom, ever supportive, grabbed a random doodle I\u2019d made off the desk and quipped, \u201cShe can\u2019t draw worth a damn, either!\u201d\n\nI guess the going rate for a damn these days is 30 an hour, given my current pay.\n\nAnyway, dry humor aside: Don\u2019t be those parents. Do better by your son. Feel free to have your reservations about his choices, but at least speak respectfully and compassionately to him about his life choices. If nothing else, don\u2019t tell him he\u2019s going to fail. The path he ends up taking might just surprise you, you know? :)", "YTA you diminished his passion for a new field (and one that needs change and fresh minds and kind hearts) and also ripped away his sense of a safety net, and you're surprised he's hurt and probably feeling like he was dropped in an icy lake?

You're telling him he's going to fail because he wants to try something different than you're envisioning for his life. In addition to that being incredibly overbearing and demeaning (doesn't he need to learn how to make his own decisions to be an adult, not just do what you say?), it's teaching him that there's no value in potentially failing something and failure is something to fear. These are terrible lessons, especially when I see no reason to assume he'd fail anything. But if he does, better to do it in your early 20s and learn than later on. It's not like he's doing drugs and dropping out, which you wouldn't want to enable, he is simply exploring another career path with plenty of opportunities... which is a perfectly valid and mature thing to do.", "YTA.

Saying \"not to come to us when he fails\" can be interpreted as not being there for him in the event that things don't work out. It's important for parents to support their children's choices and passions, even if they may not align with their own expectations or desires for their child's future. It may be helpful for you to have a more open and understanding conversation with your son about his decision, and try to understand his perspective. Additionally, it's important to remember that your son is an adult and capable of making his own decisions.", "I probably be downvoted but NAH\n\nYour son can do what he wants. But plenty of people get degrees they regret and you were just trying to keep him off that path. I think its a disservice to pretend that his new path likely has as many job opportunities.

It's not your fault when he gambles his future. \n\nWho knows maybe you'll be right, or maybe he will have what it takes to be successful. \n\nI think we all need to reevaluate both how we determine successful AND also telling people to just follow their dreams without a solid plan and based in reality.

Zara is currently in med school and doing very well for herself. Ethan is majoring in robotics and he's been doing quite well so far\n\nEthan's recently told us that he wants to switch to political science and minor in public policy. Now, I would understand if he was doing very badly or struggling, but he's not. My husband told him he's making a big mistake, not only will he lose credits, he'll have a much harder time finding a high paying, prestigious job. He's adamant on this and said this is what he wants. Eventually I said he can do whatever he wishes, but not to come to us when he fails.\n\nHe was upset and I did call him later but he didn't pick up. I sent him a text that I was sorry for saying that but we're just trying to make him see sense. He didn't reply to that either, and clearly he's still mad.\n\nMy husband said he's sulking for no reason, but I guess Ethan told Zara what happened because she was going off at me (and my husband) for it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I went to a university where they made you take three subjects in each of your first two years to broaden education and make the choice you make at age 19/20 less impactful if you make the wrong one.

And I imagine robotics at school focused on the actual building and less on the mathematics. \n\nI had a father who felt similarly to the way I think you do. You need a specific degree attached to a career path and that's the only way to guarantee a job - so do engineering, medicine, or the like. Whereas the more nebulous degrees like political science, history, philosophy have no clear career path. \n\nBut at over 40, I don't think that matters so much. I've worked in government and in research and many of my colleagues have PPEs and political science. It is a brilliant choice for someone wanting to work in government, usually a country's biggest employer, a business consultancy or anywhere where focus is clerical rather than scientific. The degree shows he can learn, is disciplined, and will teach him to communicate clearly, present, formulate ideas and understand complex matters. All those are employable skills. \n\nAnd if you get it totally wrong, then easy enough to go sideways - I did and got into another career area, weirdly a scientific one. My first degree gave me enough mathematics to cope and then I took a MSc to fill the gap. Your son is going to be working for 40+ years when he finishes - best it is something he likes.
