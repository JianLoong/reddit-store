I'm genuinely upset reading this, because it reminded me of me.\n\nThis is going to be long but I want to give OP some perspective. I started off in college majoring in biology, to eventually become a dentist. I didn't want to and it wasn't my thing at all, but my dad insisted this was the best option for me and I didn't have the backbone to say no. I graduated with said biology degree, got my DMD, and worked as a dentist for almost three years, and my family was very proud of me.\n\nI love art and literature. I got a very similar talk to what you told your son, that studying this will get me nowhere and I'll be a failure. I was part of a writing club as a teen and wrote scripts for the local theater group, but stopped because my parents thought I was wasting my time.\n\nAfter many years in a subject/profession I didn't care for, my fiance encouraged me to start living for myself and not to please my family, and I've gone back to school to get my English degree. Is it as \"prestigious\" and \"high paying\" as being a dentist? No, but that's subjective and I've learnt happiness is the greatest form of wealth. My parents aren't as proud as they were before, which hurts a bit, but that's okay.\n\nThe difference between me and your son though is that he actually stood up to say \"no, I don't want to do x subject because I don't like it, and I prefer y subject\".\n\nTelling him he's going to be a failure, and not to come to you **when** (you didn't even say if, you said **when**) he fails is awful OP. How do you know he'll fail? Is it because he fails in you and your husband's eyes, because his degree/future job won't be prestigious enough? I do agree robotics would probably lead to more career options, but let him make this decision.\n\nIn my opinion, a parent's job when their kid becomes an adult is to support them through their choices, unless they're making extremely bad decisions but this isn't the case here. Your son is still young and plenty of students switch majors in college, it's not a big deal. It's better than wasting years in something he hates.\n\nIf you want to do better, give your son the space he needs, then talk to him and tell him you support him, and he can come to you if he needs to. Even if your son fails at getting a fancy job, don't let yourself fail at being a parent.", "yta. You told him not to come to you so he will not come to you.", "YTA.\n\n\"Am I an asshole for being an asshole to my son?\"\n\nOf course you fucking are. \n\nThe English language is amazing, and there are an almost limitless number of ways you could have had a conversation with him about his choice, but instead you opted for:\n\n>not to come to us when he fails.\n\nHow about he not bother coming to you for anything at in future. Seems like he's already got a head start on doing just that.", "YTA - Your apology wasn't sincere.  It was another attempt to dig your point in.  He's still wanting to be a contributing member of society, and you want to poop on his dream.  You're telling him that money is more important than being happy.", "YTA - I mean, I agree with you that robotics likely would lead to an easier career path for him, especially since he seems to be doing well. But sometimes kids need to learn through failure. And who knows, maybe he will go on to be a great lawyer or do something else in the public policy realm that will make him much happier. Regardless of whether this works out for him, insinuating that you will abandon your child over what you perceive to be a poor decision is incredibly damaging to the relationship, and it may take him a long time to forgive you.", "But we're just trying to make him see that we think he'll be happy making more money and we don't really care if he's actually happy. Who should know better about what would make him happy, him or us? YTA\n\nETA - and it's not like he's dropping out to draw caricatures on the boardwalk. (Not that there's anything wrong with that if it makes you happy.) He's just changing majors!", "YTA, a very prestigious one. \n\n> I was sorry for saying that but we're just trying to make him see sense.\n\nThat's so sweet. I'm also sorry for saying you're a prestigious asshole, but I'm just trying to make it make sense. If you fail to make sense of it, don't come to us.", "YTA. It's fucked up that we use money as a measure of success in life and you're perpetuating that. Beyond that, you're not supporting your child in learning to do something they care about instead of something they probably originally chose to please you.", "YTA \n\nGreat job of supporting your son unconditionally! Wow, you'll be so proud of him when he graduates. Too bad he'll have gone NC before that, though! Oh, well. Hopefully, you had  found out that he graduated from mutual friends or something. Congratulations!", "YTA. When your son didn't agree to do what you wanted, you resorted to emotional abuse.", "YTA and you have 100% failed as a parent as well as just a being a kind human.", "YTA for thinking your son is unable to make a decision about his future and to work through it towards success. You basically told him not only that his choices are wrong, but also that he is absolutely going to fail and that there is no chance at all that you will support him through his decisions, even if he ultimately ends up needing help. Talk about having reasons for sulking.", "YTA - why are you assuming he\u2019s going to fail if so far he\u2019s done well in life? If he\u2019s doing well in is current course why wouldn\u2019t he continue to do well at something he\u2019s excited about? Your reasoning and explanation makes no sense. Support your son and apologize. Try learning why he\u2019s so passionate and see how you can encourage him so he doesn\u2019t fail", "YTA\n\nYou tried to use fear tactics and your kid is now old enough and smart enough to see through your BS.", "YTA what you said and did was cruel and somewhat manipulative.\n\nUsing fear tactics to get him to do what you want him to do and pursue something he really wants to do.\n\nSaying \u201cdon\u2019t come to us when you fail\u201d your basically saying you think he\u2019s going to fail. Also you\u2019re saying \u201cwe are only interested in you if you\u2019re successful and rich\u201d\n\nHave you considered he might succeed, sure he might not make loads of money but he will feel fulfilled in his career choice.", "First off\u2026 success is not always connected to high paying prestige jobs. Second off\u2026 the fact he wants political science and public policy now in these current turbulent times is incredibly admirable. With so much of the country\u2019s ills being because of the deification of the almighty dollar and the corruption that is everywhere because if it ( and the imbalance of power), his wanting to get involved in a real way is special, admirable and incredibly important. Your rejecting him because he is (in your mind) going to be less successful because you personally don\u2019t value his chosen field is heartbreaking. You should be so proud. Instead\u2026 you reject him and already have told him he will fail.  Yes\u2026 YTA. Please wake up and apologize before you lose both he and your appropriately career acceptable (to you) daughter. The world needs more people like him.", "YTA. I guess your son having a prestigious job is more important to you than his happiness. While not my cup of tea, I'm guessing you don't consider working for a politician prestigious enough? Hell chances are slim, but he might become the press secretary for a future president or work for the UN. I hope he goes NC/LC with you.", "YTA. You\u2019ve essentially told him he\u2019s going to fail anyway and have no faith in him or care about his happiness by changing his education to something he\u2019s interested in.", "YTA. How terrible to tell your son he's going to fail. You owe him an apology.", "YTA why would you ever discourage your child from pursuing their passion? Maybe, unlike you, he realizes that there are more important things in life than prestige and money.", "YTA. Congrats on showing your son that 1) you measure his value based on his job prospects  2) that his happiness matters less to you than his earning potential and 3) that you think he\u2019s somehow incapable of succeeding in any field apart from those you and your spouse have okayed. I\u2019m glad Zara\u2019s also mad at you and your husband.", "You aren't wrong that he is going to have a hard time finding a job (a job period, not just a good paying job.  The job market is flooded with political science majors rn).\n\nBut YTA for number 1. The way you approached the subject (don't come to me when you fail?  Really?) \n\nAnd number 2. You should never discourage your child from pursing their passion.\n\nIt is better for them to be happy and poor then be rich and hate going to work every day because they continued on with a degree and eventually a job that they didn't enjoy/weren't passionate about.", "YTA, I shouldn't even have to explain why, you know why", "YTA with the blunt response, even if it is a possibility that he will fail. \n\nIf it was a reoccurring thing where he continued to make poor choices and you and your husband were having to bail him out and support him over and over again, I could see that response. \n\nHowever it looks like up to this point he\u2019s been doing pretty well with his prior choices so there was really nothing to warrant the \u201cDon\u2019t bother coming to us it bites you in the ass\u201d mentality. \n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if he ends up distancing himself from you guys now. Just because you\u2019re family doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s obligated to forgive and forget. I cut my mother off years ago and have never been happier.", "YTA, Both you and your husband. Good job letting him know that your support (and probably love) is conditional.", "YTA. Not everyone prioritizes a high paying and prestigious job. Some people just want to be happy.", "YTA. Your mad your adult son is doing something he wants vs what you want, so instead of doing what parents (and decent humans for that matter) do and support and love him (regardless of your opinion... Which he didnt ask for) you use fear tactics and threaten to pull your support. Way to go. Even Jeffrey Dahmer's dad went to see him in prison.", "You\u2019re holding your support for your own son hostage to manipulate him into the career path of your choosing. YTA. Support your son or just do him a favor and cut him off entirely.", "\"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness\" is a well-known phrase from the United States Declaration of Independence. Unfortunately, many parents do not care about their children\u2019s pursuit of happiness. They plan everything for their children including the profession they\u2019re supposed to pursue because of monetary rewards. GREED obscured their common sensibilities. When kids realize that they\u2019re not happy or suited to their parents\u2019 chosen profession, and pursue that which they thought is best for themselves, these parents go nuts. OP- you should have asked AWTA? You and your husband are not only assholes, you\u2019re destroying your child\u2019s life and future. Why not study robotics yourselves? - yes the 2 of you? You\u2019re still young and can be actual robots when you graduate.", "YTA so you don\u2019t want you son to do something he enjoys, you want him in a miserable but high paying job. That\u2019s fkd up. I hope when he succeeds he leaves y\u2019all to a nursing home.", "Absolutely YTA. That was horrible. Cruel. And permanently damaging. \nNow your condemning prophecy of failure on something he,  an adult,  found passion for,  will be in his head.  And if he dwells on it he might fail when he wouldn't have.  And if he does,  you have broken his spirit. \nYou have a limited time to do damage control.  But he will be bitter. And rightfully so", "Maybe he doesn't want a high paying prestigious job! Wouldn't it be better that he be happy in his career? Are you always this controlling? YTA for being straight up nasty to him and trying to influence his life! You already lived your life, let him have his!", "YTA - Why do you think political science will end up with him not having a career? I know lots of people with poly sci degrees that work in various fields. I've met plenty working in DC for elected officials.", "YTA. \"Sulking for no reason,\" he found out what he wanted to do in life, and his parents were not only supportive but threatened to not even be there for him if he struggles a little bit.\n\nHe has plenty of reason to be upset, and I wouldn't even bother answering your texts for a long time.", "YTA\n\nYou're more concerned with him finding a good paying job than him being able to do something he's passionate about. If he can't come to you when he fails you aren't allowed to ask anything of him when he succeeds.\nOn another note any parent that says \"don't come to me when you fail\" is an AH. Your kids *should* be able to come to you to talk and lament when they fail, life is trial and error.", "YTA\n\nOf course he's mad. He has parents who don't support him unless he makes choices they agree with. I could see that if his choices were hookers and blow, but if the guy wants to take a different academic path, you've got no business being discouraging. It's literally his life he's deciding here. Your perception of what will make the most money is not necessarily what will make him happy.", "YTA.", "YTA. That\u2019s an awful thing to say. Imagine hearing from your own parents that they don\u2019t care what happens to you.", "YTA!\n\nAs a parent, I would never tell my kids they couldn't come back home if they were struggling.

Social sciences teach data analysis that can be really useful and highly employable. He probably should go to grad school, but it\u2019s not a useless degree.

Sharing my own story here for reference: I had a Chinese mom and grew up experiencing a bit of the \u201cTiger Parent\u201d parenting stereotype. I\u2019d loved writing and visual art since I was very young, but my parents always dismissed those passions as petty hobbies and instead pushed me toward everything STEM (which I admittedly didn\u2019t hate and did have an aptitude for). Come college I was basically told I could choose any major, so long as it was engineering.\n\nFast forward five years, during which I switched my B.S. field from CS to mechanical engineering and clawed my way to the finish line in 2021 - on time, no less, even though my parents (still not satisfied with my love of the arts, despite me caving to their demands major-wise) abandoned me and left me to fend entirely for myself, financially and otherwise, at the end of freshman year. I didn\u2019t go into industry but did get a job managing an engineering lab with my alma mater. I hated every minute of it.\n\nFor my sanity, I quit that job late last year and serendipitously snagged a full-time job in copywriting alongside a \u201cfor fun\u201d part-time gig with a consultancy firm at the same time. It\u2019s night and day. I can\u2019t exaggerate how much better these new positions have been on every front. They\u2019re flexible and remote; the supes and staff are insanely nice and compassionate, unlike my crotchety, demanding Successful STEM Man stereotype of a previous boss; and I get PAID MORE, by a long shot. Yes, really! And I got these new jobs pretty much entirely on the merit of being a strong writer (demonstrated via my personal portfolio and some short test tasks I completed during my interview processes), and in spite of my degree having nothing to do with writing or any of the responsibilities listed in my current positions.\n\nThe point is this: My love of writing has been so unwavering throughout my life that despite spending almost all my time in college earning a degree in a totally unrelated field at my parents\u2019 behest - even though I was forbidden from pursuing writing and the arts in any academic capacity - I managed to keep it up and prove myself worthy of a bona fide professional writing position, and a successful one at that.\n\nWe know, in our hearts, what we love. We know what we\u2019re good at. And one way or another, it is very likely we\u2019ll find our way back to that path, no matter how hard you try to contempt it. \n\n(I mean, not always! Sometimes we guess and we guess wrong. We\u2019re young. But at the very least you owe your child the trust and respect of letting them choose. If it turns out they\u2019ve made a mistake, so be it; that happens, and it is part of life to live and learn. Plus, your son sounds smart and resourceful - even mistakes probably won\u2019t turn out badly for him.)\n\nSomething I recall that has always stuck with me is when, during college essay submission season, my dad was looking over my work and said, \u201cShe can\u2019t write worth a damn.\u201d Mom, ever supportive, grabbed a random doodle I\u2019d made off the desk and quipped, \u201cShe can\u2019t draw worth a damn, either!\u201d\n\nI guess the going rate for a damn these days is 30 an hour, given my current pay.\n\nAnyway, dry humor aside: Don\u2019t be those parents. Do better by your son. Feel free to have your reservations about his choices, but at least speak respectfully and compassionately to him about his life choices. If nothing else, don\u2019t tell him he\u2019s going to fail. The path he ends up taking might just surprise you, you know? :)", "YTA you diminished his passion for a new field (and one that needs change and fresh minds and kind hearts) and also ripped away his sense of a safety net, and you're surprised he's hurt and probably feeling like he was dropped in an icy lake?

You're telling him he's going to fail because he wants to try something different than you're envisioning for his life. In addition to that being incredibly overbearing and demeaning (doesn't he need to learn how to make his own decisions to be an adult, not just do what you say?), it's teaching him that there's no value in potentially failing something and failure is something to fear. These are terrible lessons, especially when I see no reason to assume he'd fail anything. But if he does, better to do it in your early 20s and learn than later on. It's not like he's doing drugs and dropping out, which you wouldn't want to enable, he is simply exploring another career path with plenty of opportunities... which is a perfectly valid and mature thing to do.", "YTA.

Saying \"not to come to us when he fails\" can be interpreted as not being there for him in the event that things don't work out. It's important for parents to support their children's choices and passions, even if they may not align with their own expectations or desires for their child's future. It may be helpful for you to have a more open and understanding conversation with your son about his decision, and try to understand his perspective. Additionally, it's important to remember that your son is an adult and capable of making his own decisions.", "I probably be downvoted but NAH\n\nYour son can do what he wants. But plenty of people get degrees they regret and you were just trying to keep him off that path. I think its a disservice to pretend that his new path likely has as many job opportunities.

It's not your fault when he gambles his future. \n\nWho knows maybe you'll be right, or maybe he will have what it takes to be successful. \n\nI think we all need to reevaluate both how we determine successful AND also telling people to just follow their dreams without a solid plan and based in reality.

Zara is currently in med school and doing very well for herself. Ethan is majoring in robotics and he's been doing quite well so far\n\nEthan's recently told us that he wants to switch to political science and minor in public policy. Now, I would understand if he was doing very badly or struggling, but he's not. My husband told him he's making a big mistake, not only will he lose credits, he'll have a much harder time finding a high paying, prestigious job. He's adamant on this and said this is what he wants. Eventually I said he can do whatever he wishes, but not to come to us when he fails.\n\nHe was upset and I did call him later but he didn't pick up. I sent him a text that I was sorry for saying that but we're just trying to make him see sense. He didn't reply to that either, and clearly he's still mad.\n\nMy husband said he's sulking for no reason, but I guess Ethan told Zara what happened because she was going off at me (and my husband) for it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He has every right to be upset with both of you and go NC. This is important to him and all you care about is how much money he might make in the future? Awesome parenting skills. YOU sound like the failure as a parent to me. YTA. Hubby is too.", "Way to support your kid OP/s. Sounds like your kid\u2019s education and career aspirations are more for you and your husband rather than for your kids to actually be (gasp) happy. YTA", "YTA", "YTA", "YTA and fyi, my husband and I both have the degree your son wants and are doing really well.", "YTA.\n\nYou can be good at something you dislike.\n\nSource: Good friend from college didn't want to 'waste' 2 years already invested in an Engineering degree. Now has spent literal decades doing a job he hates.", "YTA - you basically just told your kid that he's stupid and you don't believe in him. Maybe he is good at robotics but hates it. Maybe he has been in a particular stem pigeon hole and wants to explore, that's part of what school is for. He is young, now is the time for him to try new things. Heck now is even the time for him to fail if that's what happens. By the way, having an ordinary job rather than a high paying prestigious job isn't failure. He isn't sulking, he is ignoring unsupportive people who happen to be his parents.", "YTA you literally told him to not come to you now you\u2019re upset he won\u2019t come to you. It will take a way more sincere apology then you seem to be capable of to keep him from going no contact. Why do you get to decide what an adult spends his life doing. You were mean and judgmental", "If he can figure out robotics, I think he's going to do ok in political science. \n\nNot to throw shade on political science folks or imply that it's easy, but I think if he's succeeding in robotics, he's *probably* smart enough to understand the earning and prestige differential he's going to get by switching.\n\nAt 26, he's had more time than most to figure out where his interests lie, and I'd be much more inclined to trust that this is something he's passionate about and that he won't give up without a fight. Particularly when he's committed to doing it despite his parents doing their best to kick him down in the process. \n\nYou might also consider what paths will open up to him because of his unique combination of education. Robotics is a growing field, and we're going to need savvy, technically-minded people like your son to write intelligent laws and policies to accommodate that growth. \n\nIt's fine to counsel your son and to point out the things about his plan that make you worry. Maybe you'll have some useful points he hasn't considered, and he'll adjust his plan because of your advice. But to straight up tell him \"when you fail, don't come to us\" is too far. Is it \"abandon your children and kick them while they're down\" night on Reddit or something? YTA.", "YTA- my only hope for my children is that they find a job/career they\u2019re happy with. Will I give advice and tell them x job will afford you more than y job. Yes but at the end of the day. They\u2019re living that life and their happiness is more important than how much their career makes them. I don\u2019t like my job very much but it\u2019s a paycheck. I want more for them.", "YTA. Not everything in life is about having a \"prestigious\" job. If he is more interested in another area and feels confident he can at least make a living in that area, it's not your place to belittle him and say he's going to be a failure. This is 100% how you cause adult children to want nothing to do with you.", "You are not the AH for telling him that political science and public policy studies are not likely to lead to a financially secure profession, because very few people with that educational background do well money-wise but at his age YTA for trying to coerce him.  That is a manipulative tactic that won't end well for either of you.", "INFO what are your plans for when you're old and in diapers? Do you think doctor daughter is going to have time to visit you?", "YTA\n\nWhat is it with parents demanding their kids have \u201chigh paying\u201d careers?  Do you not want your child to follow their passion?  Do you want him to be miserable for the duration of his working life, so you can have the prestige of a kid with a high paying career?\n\nAs a parent I want my child to do what makes them happy. I don\u2019t care of the don\u2019t make a 6 figure salary if they are a functioning and happy member of society. \n\nDo better.", "I'm sure Ethan really, really appreciated knowing his parents think that he's going to fail and won't offer him any support *if* he does. Also, you told him not to come to you. He isn't coming to you. Why are you so upset?\n\nYTA.", "Yta. Ppl change interest, I would tell him to finish robotics so he has that under his belt then do what ever. But telling him not to come to you when he fails?? That's insane he will never come to you again and that's ur fault. That's how you lose on being in ur kids life \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I have no words. YTA. YTA.

YTA.", "YTA Coming from someone who switched majors from zoo science to English and now works as a legal secretary. We can't predict where our own paths will take us, but you dare predict your brilliant son's future? What you said is the kind of thing that causes irreparable rupture of bonds and of trust. I hope it was worth it.", "Just like my parents, woo...", "YTA. I don\u2019t know where you think he can\u2019t find prestigious jobs in that degree field. There are plenty of respectable high earning jobs he can open the door to with such a degree. I know someone with that exact combination of degrees that works in an embassy quickly on their way to some day being an ambassador at some point. \nYTA. For trying to take the hard line don\u2019t be surprised when he doesn\u2019t share his success with you when he does follow his passions and makes a successful career for himself.", "YTA there\u2019s more to things in life than money. Did you ask him why he wants to switch? Maybe it\u2019s his passion, maybe he wants a challenge, maybe something in his environment inspired him but you\u2019re too busy looking at money and prestige to support your son.", "YTA. Why would you push your son to be unhappy? It's not like he wants to play video games all day and live in your basement. Basically, money and prestige are more important to you than your sone is. And the field he's chosen can come with opportunities for both great prestige and significant impact on people's lives. Not to mention, a comfortable lifestyle.", "YTA My parent said stuff like this to me growing up. Guess what? I don\u2019t go to them for anything now and they wonder why I am LC.", "YTA - Maybe have a conversation with your son? Why does he feel the way he does? He's super young but probably doesn't understand or isn't considering the long term implications to his perceived lifestyle, especially if he wasn't raised in poverty. It's on you to get that across to him in a way that he can understand.", "YTA.  Did your son ask you to support him financially if he can\u2019t find a job?  If so, why bring it up now?   Clearly, Ethan is a bright young man and he probably understands the changing job market better than you and your husband do since at this stage in your life.  So, if he wants to change his major, then why not start out with the assumption that he must have a pretty good reason for wanting to do so?  Do you even know what Ethan\u2019s reasons are?  Your son is in the middle of making an important decision and he came to you guys for support and maybe advice.  Instead of listening to him and giving him the courage to make his own decisions and live his own life by assuring him that you have confidence in the person that he has grown up to be and that you respect his judgment, you and your husband told him that he\u2019s making a bad decision and then essentially threatened to cut him off if things don\u2019t work out.  Good riddance on your parenting skills.", "YTA. So your kid is only acceptable to you if they have a high paying, prestigious job huh? Real good parent you are. Maybe he wants to make a difference in the world and he has chosen to do it this way. You could, you know, actually be supportive. Did you even bother to ask him if he has a long term plan for what he wants to do? Or even ask him what he wants to do? Or did you just assume? Pull your head out of your ass and actually listen to your child instead of worrying about appearances.\n\nEdit: typos", "YTA. The options are not \u201chigh paying prestigious job\u201d or \u201cfail\u201d. My question is what are you going to do when he gets a modest earning job in his desired field that he enjoys and allows him good work life balance and then has little to no contact with you because you always make him feel like a disappointment? Because that is by far the most likely outcome.", "If he\u2019s going to get into politics he needs a MUCH thicker skin than that.", "YTA. It\u2019s his life and his choice. Why do you choose to be an enemy to him when you can support him instead? I\u2019ll never understand parents who choose to bully their kids. You should be his biggest cheerleader.", "You just told him you dont believe in him and expect him to fail. Why would he want to talk to you?", "YTA. You don\u2019t want him to have a career he\u2019s passionate about, you just want the prestige of having your kid in a high paying job.", "YTA, so being a lawyer isn\u2019t good enough for you and your husband? That\u2019s only one high pay prestigious jobs you can get with a political science degree, I don\u2019t even know what kind of high prestigious job you can get with a major in robotics but it\u2019s also almost 1 in the morning and I am exhausted so I am sure there\u2019s plenty of them.", "You are a bad parent. YTA", "Yta big deal he's not failing its NOT THE POINT. He's NOT HAPPY and you've told him you don't care and you don't care that he fails and you won't be there for him like a parent would and should", "YTA\n\nDid you even have a conversation about the why behind this change? What careers he's looking at, what is inspiring him? Because if it is a flash in the pan love, you have other ways to approach it. If he's put a lot of thought into it and has a plan in mind, then you can say okay and leave him be.", "YTA\n\nDo you really want your children to be rich and miserable? This is how you get rich and miserable children.", "YTA\n\nIf he\u2019s smart/driven, he can have a great career in politics/government. He might not make as much money as in a stem career, but he can easily be in the top quartile of income earners (assuming you\u2019re in the US).\n\nLife isn\u2019t all about money, and he\u2019s not choosing a minimum wage path that will lead to a constant struggle. So he makes 100k/year instead of 200k/year. Who cares?", "YTA. Honestly idk why people like you have kids to begin with, if you\u2019re either going to just force them into what you\u2019d like or wish them to fail if they dare want something else for themselves.", "YTA. You're basically saying that failure is forbidden. I guess you didn't mean it but you shouldn't have said it", "I\u2019m going against the grain on this one - soft NTA. \n\nObviously, you care for your child but the approach you are taking is counterproductive in the long run. \n\nComing out of high school, I wanted to go into acting or a career in advertising. My father persuaded me to go into engineering with the rationale that I could always change careers or pick up an additional degree. \n\nHated it but in hindsight, his persuasion gave me more options - and I\u2019ve ended up marrying degrees in engineering & humanities + my love for stand-up comedy in my career. \n\nPersuasion works better than threats especially if your son is as headstrong as I was.", "YTA. He wants to change majors, not drop out of college and pursue meth. What a truly awful thing to say to your child. I don\u2019t understand how you can even be asking this right now. Horrible parent move. You failed big time in that conversation.", "Not only YTA, you're weirdly myopic! Political science and public policy can lead to very prestigious and lucrative fields and careers. He didn't say he wanted to switch his major to philosophy with a minor in mime!! Even if he had your response would still make you TA but at least your concerns for his earning potential would be somewhat valid. As it is you just sound foolish as well as cruel and cold.", "You give off \"I peaked in college\" energy. YTA", "YTA. \n\nAlso...Technical careers are really competitive and it's extremely difficult to maintain motivation. Burnout is common. If he's not into it, good grades aren't going to make him successful in that career anyway. \n\nMy BIL sounds like this exact story. He dropped out middle of his last semester, attempted suicide multiple times, and is now working as a chef where he realized he wanted to be in his 2nd year before the suicide attempts and failure of his parents.", "YTA \n\nThat\u2019s not how parenting works. He\u2019s taking a risk; it\u2019s an informed risk and it\u2019s not like he\u2019s joining the circus here. \n\nTelling our children they can\u2019t come to us if they should fail? Do you even love him? Do you know what love is?", "NTA as someone with a MA in Political Science, I can tell you sometimes finding a good well paid job is up to good connections & luck.  I tell everyone thinking of this field to think it through & have a plan B.  Double majors could be a good plan in this case.", "NTA - sounds like your comment was more out of frustration than you actually meaning it. You obviously care for your son to have a successful life.\n\nIMO, you should convince him to keep pursuing robotics and see if he can minor in political science / public policy. Being in STEM gives you an advantage purely from the dynamics of the job market.\n\nI\u2019m assuming this is the first time your son is completely independent, and he\u2019s meeting new people and may be getting influenced.", "NTA but you could have phrased it better.", "So true and well written. Better for us to have failed at our dreams but know we gave it our best effort then to always wonder. So much better then always putting other peoples wishes for us ahead of our own which is soul sucking. \n\nWhen I started my own business 5 years ago my dad told me I was an idiot and was going to fail. But 5 years later my business is still going strong and now he brags to his friends about my success. Go figure. I like to remind him cheekily he didn\u2019t always think this was a good idea for me lol. We\u2019re both glad now I didn\u2019t listen to him and did something just for me and he feels bad he responded the way he did because he was worried about me. We\u2019ve since made amends But as adults we get to decide what risks are worth it to us.", "Well said. I teach writing, and I have so many students who really wanted to pursue humanties/writing but who were 'talked out of it' by their parents.\n\nIt's really sad, because some of them have spent their whole lives being someone they didn't want to be. You can see them blossom as they get to grips with their stories; they come alive in a whole new way. They even WALK differently!", "Yep. Speaking as an adult who tried to tell my parents when I was 19 that I didn\u2019t like my (brand fucking new, so it\u2019s not even a big deal to switch) major, I was met with the same reasoning. \u201cYou\u2019re doing fine, there are great benefits to that job, you\u2019ll lose your credits\u201d (which I wouldn\u2019t have, I would just have needed more)\u2026.\n\nYTA 100%. I absolutely hate my job. My skills and strengths and interests are absolutely wasted in this job. I daydream constantly about what my life would be like if I had just gone with my gut. I wasted my most resilient, malleable years when I should have been making changes like that, and now 15 years down the road I\u2019m looking at some serious consequences and uncertainty if I switch careers now. I have a mortgage now. I have obligations now. I\u2019d be losing all my seniority. Do you understand how badly I wish I could go back and lose a semester\u2019s worth of credits instead of 15 years of seniority?\n\nThey would have supported me, but they made me feel like acknowledging that it wasn\u2019t the right fit was tantamount to failure. Which is what you\u2019re doing with your son. You didn\u2019t say if he fails; you said when. \n\n> I sent him a text that I was sorry for saying that but we're just trying to make him see sense. \n\nWhich is it. Are you sorry because you knew it was shitty and untrue, or do you still think it was only \u201csensible\u201d and you\u2019re only sorry he\u2019s not talking to you?\n\nYou\u2019re not trying to make him \u201csee sense.\u201d You\u2019re trying to force him to make decisions based on YOUR priorities. Money. That\u2019s not sense, that\u2019s your perspective. He\u2019s trying to make decisions based on HIS priorities: not hating the career he is literally going to spend the majority of his life doing every single day. Sounds sensible to me. \n\nMy parents were obsessed with \u201csecurity\u201d and \u201clifestyle.\u201d That\u2019s what they wish they had in their jobs, and that\u2019s what they naively thought teaching represented. Job security and summers off. Well fuck me, right? Education in North America is a dumpster fire. \n\nSupport him, for Christ\u2019s sake. Don\u2019t threaten to leave him to stew in his own choices and then try and call to chat like nothing happened. He may be throwing away a few credits, but you\u2019re throwing away your relationship.", "If you don\u2019t have enough money it\u2019s impossible to be happy.", "Well just that being the reaction of when you fail. He sounds like a smart kid...why would he fail? Or why would that be your initial reaction to your child. Goodness.", "Plus work is most of your life, you need to do what you like. I\u2019d rather be happy doing a job where I earn less than be miserable spending my life working a well earning job I hate.", "Some of the careers he could go into with that major and minor: law (can be super lucrative).

THIS.", "well written out!", "He probably won't forgive", ">I hope when he succeeds he leaves y\u2019all to a nursing home.\n\nIf he can't rely on them for help, they damn well better not expect him to step in when they're in need. The petty in me is for this comment.", "From the major change looks like he wants to be a politician of some kind. Not really a respectable profession in my opinion but it's their choice. I wouldn't pay for the extra years it's gonna take him to graduate because of this change.", "He can still get into public policy with a robotics degree\u2026.not as easy the other way around.\n\nWe do have way too many political science majors and indeed too many lawyers.", "That's great your dad is more supportive now! I know some business owners get shat on when they're starting out, but end up being very successful. \n\nAbsolutely, sometimes you have to take these risks instead of always wondering \"what if\". I'm happy I managed to go into a field I love eventually.", "This right here. I started off as a premed major. I was miserable. I told my parents how I was feeling and received pressure and guilt trips to convince me to stay the course. Imagine how disappointed they were when I finally dropped out altogether. I got my life back on track eventually (and completely on my own) but I wasted a chunk of years feeling discouraged and working dead end jobs.  \n\nYTA, OP. This is your child\u2019s life, not yours, and it\u2019s their own decision to make. As a parent, you should be offering support and encouragement to do what makes him happy.", "True - are you saying that he is incapable of earning enough to live on with the path he wants?", "Never met a skydiver huh?", "He\u2019s got a massively lower chance of any possible success much less achieving stability with a political science degree.", "Sounds like you have no faith in him at all.  Previous judgement still stands.", "But I'm sure he's always aware of this. Even if he isn't, the parents could've made their point without saying \"don't come to us when you fail\" - and yes, massively lower chance, but not impossible. \n\nThere's a difference between informing and telling him he's going to fail.", "Sure, but it's definitely not impossible. Far from it, he could go onto the UN, into the political field, even a lawyer if he wants to. He's making this decision and I'm assuming he's informed of the pros and cons. Why not let him to something he loves, but might be less successful in over something he hates but he's rich? \n\nThe parents can tell him why they think it might not be a good decision, but saying they know he'll fail and not to come to them, in my opinion, is not the sign of a good parent"]}
