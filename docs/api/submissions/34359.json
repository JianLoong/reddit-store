Don't have pets if you can't afford to feed and care for them.", "NTA. I have 4 dogs of my own plus I foster dogs for a local rescue. While the rescue provides food for the dogs I foster, im not going to take in any animal I can't reasonay afford to feed on my own dime. Your brother's cats are awaiting transfer and they need something to eat and litter to use the restroom in until they go.
