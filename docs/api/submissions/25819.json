My FMIL(55f) never really liked me, due to my tattoos/piercings, a practicing pagan, and former SW. However my fianc\u00e9, who is also heavily modded, is always quick to tell her to keep her mouth shut if she has nothing nice to say. And for the most part, we\u2019ve had no major issues. My Great aunt (69f), she essentially had nothing much to with me after the first tattoo, until I got engaged.\n\nI took my FMIL, his Gma, and FSILs, my mom, sister and my GA, who wasn\u2019t invited but showed up at my house anyway before we left. Didn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings so I let her come with us.\n\nOfc as soon as I walk out in the first champagne dress FMIL says \u201cits cute but its not white\u2026\u201d my mom corrects her, \u201cshe\u2019s not getting a white dress, bc she doesn\u2019t want one.\u201d GA scoffs and crosses her arms, \u201cwell, Im NOT paying for a dress if its not going to be a real wedding dress!\u201d I then reminded her that I am paying this dress and worked my ass off for a year to save for my dress, for this specific reason. I found this BEAUTIFUL black ballgown $350 under my budget. Everyone but FMIL and GA was crying happy tears, they were silent so I honestly thought maybe they\u2019d just accepted it. Or were just afraid of my mom, who was continuously jumping their asses the entire time we were shopping.\n\nI guess FMIL and aunt exchanged contact and decided to both send me a list of demands or they wouldn\u2019t be attending;\n\n-I have to get a new dress that will cover all of my tattoos, with both of them present so they can make sure it CORRECT\n-I have to take all my piercings out for the wedding \u201cso they can actually look at and show off the pictures\n-the dress HAS to be white\nAnd to top it off the bottom of text from FMIL read \u201cI am tired of your BS, enough is enough. It\u2019s time to grow the hell up!! A black dress is satanic, it makes your GA and I extremely uncomfortable. Nothing you are is of God. And it is a slap in the face to [fianc\u00e9] to display to the world how much of a used woman you are to go wear the complete opposite of innocence and virginity. If you do not cooperate I will be messaging my son\u201d\nSo, I just replied with then don\u2019t come! :) and formally disinvited my aunt, basically told her to go F herself in HR.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 told his mother that if she cannot accept me for the way I am, then she can\u2019t accept him. And that if that\u2019s the case and she wants be a hypocrite, then maybe she should sit the wedding out. So now she\u2019s refusing to come, and is trying to get the rest of his family to drop out of the wedding, and some are bc they say I\u2019m disrespectful and a bridezilla? Now I\u2019m being slammed with calls from families. Some are on my side, a lot of them are saying I should just get a white dress and suck it up, that it\u2019s not fair to my fianc\u00e9 that his mom & some of his family wont be there now, and now I feel really guilty and like I should just return the dress and get something else so everyone can just be happy again\u2026 AITA?", "created_utc": 1693343462, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/164ujp3/aita_for_keeping_a_black_wedding_dress/", "score": 306, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They want you to start your married life with a pretence of something that there is no reason you should be?", "\ud83c\udfb5I hold your hand in mine, dear...\ud83c\udfb5", "I am sorry now I killed you....", "The answer to that has a number of different factors to it.\n\nVictoria was a total horn-dog when it came to Albert. They were very much in love with each other, but she was the more physically affectionate of the two.\n\nRight before, and for awhile after, they married, Victoria loved dinner parties and dancing at balls. Albert did not care for the lavish, alcohol drenched parties and contemporaries noted that he always seemed ill at ease with what was the norm of London\u2019s high-society at the time. \n\nAs time progressed and their family grew (they had 9 children - Victoria *loved* the process of making a baby, but loathed being pregnant; she was not maternal at all, once lamenting she wished she and Albert could be alone, without any of the children), both she and Albert had very strict and moralistic attitudes about sex when it came to their children. They were both absolutely horrified and enraged when they found out that their oldest son, Prince Bertie, who was heir to the throne, had lost his virginity to an actress, instead of waiting for marriage. But, at the time, it was actually quite normal and within the expectations of their social class for young men to lose their virginity to either actresses or prostitutes.\n\nThe reason they were so incensed is because both Albert and Victoria came from families that had basically destroyed themselves due to the rampant extramarital affairs everyone was having. The only reason Victoria became the monarch was because no one higher up in the pecking order had any legitimate children still living. \n\nVictoria also intertwined her son\u2019s \u201csexually deviant\u201d behavior with the death of her beloved Albert. When they found out what Bertie had done, Albert went to see him at Cambridge, where he was studying. They went for a walk so that Albert could properly scold his son for his outrageous and unacceptable conduct, and during that time it started to rain. When Albert returned, he was soaked through and caught a chill. In the coming days, he did become very ill and was eventually diagnosed with typhoid fever. He died nearly three weeks after his talk with Bertie. Victoria was convinced that her eldest son was responsible for the death of the most important person in her life until the day she died. \n\nAfter Albert died, Victoria went into a very deep mourning, and stayed there for years. For a long time she would become infuriated if any of her children even laughed, and heaven forbid anyone look like they were happy about anything. She also disappeared from public view for a number of years because she was so grief-stricken. It got so bad that it almost caused a constitutional crisis, because people were starting to question whether or not they even *needed* a monarch at all if no one ever saw them. Luckily, she eventually started making just enough appearances (there were also a few events over the years that would increase her & the family\u2019s popularity). And she continued to wear mourning black clothes until the day she died.\n\nSorry for the novel. I actually have a kind of catchphrase, that \u201cI\u2019m allergic to brevity,\u201d due to my inability to tell a short story or paraphrase anything, lol. I should honestly probably have that as my flair. But anyway, the perception and reality of Albert and Victoria are in many ways the same, though the causes might be quite different. All of that particular unit of the Royal Family were kind of odd ducks, even for the time period. But Albert and much more so Victoria\u2019s behavior over the years influenced the entire generation. Some of it was crafted & stage-managed, to give the perception that they were an upstanding and moral \u201cinstitution,\u201d that was nothing like their lascivious predecessors; and some of it was just *them.*\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, there are a few documentaries that focus more on her as a person (vs her reign as queen), her relationship with her children, and there\u2019s also one that focuses on her journals/diaries (she was an extremely prolific writer).
