My FMIL(55f) never really liked me, due to my tattoos/piercings, a practicing pagan, and former SW. However my fianc\u00e9, who is also heavily modded, is always quick to tell her to keep her mouth shut if she has nothing nice to say. And for the most part, we\u2019ve had no major issues. My Great aunt (69f), she essentially had nothing much to with me after the first tattoo, until I got engaged.\n\nI took my FMIL, his Gma, and FSILs, my mom, sister and my GA, who wasn\u2019t invited but showed up at my house anyway before we left. Didn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings so I let her come with us.\n\nOfc as soon as I walk out in the first champagne dress FMIL says \u201cits cute but its not white\u2026\u201d my mom corrects her, \u201cshe\u2019s not getting a white dress, bc she doesn\u2019t want one.\u201d GA scoffs and crosses her arms, \u201cwell, Im NOT paying for a dress if its not going to be a real wedding dress!\u201d I then reminded her that I am paying this dress and worked my ass off for a year to save for my dress, for this specific reason. I found this BEAUTIFUL black ballgown $350 under my budget. Everyone but FMIL and GA was crying happy tears, they were silent so I honestly thought maybe they\u2019d just accepted it. Or were just afraid of my mom, who was continuously jumping their asses the entire time we were shopping.\n\nI guess FMIL and aunt exchanged contact and decided to both send me a list of demands or they wouldn\u2019t be attending;\n\n-I have to get a new dress that will cover all of my tattoos, with both of them present so they can make sure it CORRECT\n-I have to take all my piercings out for the wedding \u201cso they can actually look at and show off the pictures\n-the dress HAS to be white\nAnd to top it off the bottom of text from FMIL read \u201cI am tired of your BS, enough is enough. It\u2019s time to grow the hell up!! A black dress is satanic, it makes your GA and I extremely uncomfortable. Nothing you are is of God. And it is a slap in the face to [fianc\u00e9] to display to the world how much of a used woman you are to go wear the complete opposite of innocence and virginity. If you do not cooperate I will be messaging my son\u201d\nSo, I just replied with then don\u2019t come! :) and formally disinvited my aunt, basically told her to go F herself in HR.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 told his mother that if she cannot accept me for the way I am, then she can\u2019t accept him. And that if that\u2019s the case and she wants be a hypocrite, then maybe she should sit the wedding out. So now she\u2019s refusing to come, and is trying to get the rest of his family to drop out of the wedding, and some are bc they say I\u2019m disrespectful and a bridezilla? Now I\u2019m being slammed with calls from families. Some are on my side, a lot of them are saying I should just get a white dress and suck it up, that it\u2019s not fair to my fianc\u00e9 that his mom & some of his family wont be there now, and now I feel really guilty and like I should just return the dress and get something else so everyone can just be happy again\u2026 AITA?", "created_utc": 1693343462, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/164ujp3/aita_for_keeping_a_black_wedding_dress/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
