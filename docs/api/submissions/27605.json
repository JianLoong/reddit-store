I think you were trying to take it on the chin so that it didn\u2019t ruin the big day but just because she\u2019s getting married doesn\u2019t mean she can treat you however she wants. It sounds like she basically used you as her punching bag for her negative emotions so that she could be nice to everyone else. Im getting married soon too and I couldnt imagine acting this way to my sister who has spent a lot of time and money to make things special. I would love to have a sister that is as helpful as you. You\u2019ve already done a lot for her and she doesn\u2019t need to treat you like that.", "Weddings can be stressful, and you chose not to speak up beforehand but want to make her feel bad now? To what end? So what if none of her friends helped her cleaned up? You could have said no before. YWBTA if you try to makeher feel bad now. I bet a lot of the snapping and eye rolling is just you looking for things to be hurt by.", "NTA. If to makes you feel better than you should, but be prepared for her defense and possibly posing as the victim.", "NTA but I'd advise against it. What will it accomplish to tell her this now? Maybe don't agree to do things for her in the future but unless you're itching for a fight with your sister, I'd move on.", "Info: is the behavior ongoing?\n\nIf not, there's no point to the convo anymore. I get you're pissed at the whole situation but unless you're getting a tangible benefit from talking it out, you're just starting a conversation that very realistically ends up with you and your sister on even worse terms.  Either way, do not bring up her friends in the conversation. Not your place and not really germane to the talk.", "Being a bride isn\u2019t a license to treat people like crap. Tell her that you being maid of honour is obviously stressing her out and for her own good you have decided to step down to allow her to replace you with one of her lovely good friends whose company she seems to enjoy more than yours.", "Depends if this was a one off blot in an otherwise okish relationship. Or is it part of a pattern of disparagement to you? Maybe let one day of snappyness drop.. but don't put up with ongoing unkindness", "NTA - But don't confront her. Just let it roll off your back.

Let her figure out life on her own.", "NTA, but think long and hard about the outcome you expect to happen here.  *Do you think she's going to see the error of her ways and apologize?*  She's going to get mad, scream at you, and say it was your job take it and be her scapegoat on her special day.  Right?  Right.  I know, I have a narcissist sister, too. \n\nSo what I would do is just chalk this up to human experience, and go LC.  You don't need someone in your life to continually step on you.   You've learned a lesson - don't help her again.  Move on, find better people to hang around with.   And if she asks you to be MOH at her second wedding, well, say no. You read enough Reddit, you learn that \"faaaaamily\" doesn't mean anything if they're going to knock you down.", "WYBTA? In my opinion, no. But you need to think carefully before you do. IMO, bring this up with her if both conditions apply:\n\n1. She's always like this, mean and belittling to you, and it's not just wedding stress;\n\n2. You're willing to stand your ground and use this as a way to set boundaries for the future.\n\nHowever, if 1 applies and 2 doesn't, I personally wouldn't raise the issue but would act to distance myself from her.", "YWBTA if you did it now, because weddings are very very stressful and your sister will not have been at her best. But I think you can bring it up if she asks you to help out with something important in future.", "NTA. It's completely ok to tell someone their behaviour was hurtful or unpleasant. \n\nSometimes people find it easier to be horrible to family when they're stressed or unhappy, *because* they're family. It can feel safer to unload on people when you know the relationship is permanent. Friends can end friendships but siblings are always siblings. I'm not saying that makes it ok, but sometimes it's a reason.", "I feel the same way about how my brothers wedding went. I was miserable and just flat out ignored all day after shelling out thousands to be a bridesmaid. Im taking a long time out from him and my new SIL. No need to cause drama by bringing it up because I know they'd twist it on me. I spent a week in the hospital following the wedding after getting strep from it and it flaring up some existing issues I have (my biggest fear going was getting sick) and as much as I want to send them the bill I won't. Its not worth it. Its okay to be angry upset and hurt. But whats done is done. \n\nYWBTA", "NTA, but in my opinion, confronting her is a waste of time. Just distance yourself from her. You're an adult and there is literally no reason to give her one further second of your time or attention.\n\nIf she asks specifically why you want nothing to do with her, tell her concisely but honestly why. And make it clear that it's not a negotiation.", "So what, she is bride. Being bride is very stressful. You are pissed because you were not center attention. You did your sisterly duties. Move on and be happy for her.", "YWBTA\n\nI know you feel like you have to get it off your chest but it won\u2019t help. You should look into going at least low contact with your sister. She\u2019s not good to you.", "What purpose does confronting her now actually serve? Just go low or no contact and move on. She can go be awful elsewhere, you can go live your own life. If she ever asks for anything again I might bring it up, but for now? Eh.

Are you prepared to deal with the consequences of confronting her, which could include going low to no contact?", "Not quite the same, but at my brother\u2019s wedding, I was super sick and left early (months of suffering later I found I had a Haemoglobin of 6 when it should be double that) My memories of the day are just of misery. as I felt so ill and it was super hot. But I don\u2019t discuss that with my brother and his wife, and never have.", "What do you envision will happen?  That she'll see the error of her ways and be nicer to you?\n\nWhat you can do is start standing up for yourself.  If she balks at that, you can tell her you reached your limits with how she treated you up to and during her wedding.  Don't detail anything, just shut her down.  Hard.\n\nIf you need to, walk away and go low- or no-contact.", "NTA. Wow I am suprosed by all of the YTA votes. No one should be treated that way. And she probably DOESNT think she treated you poorly. Because it was all about her. It really depends on what type of relationship you have with your sister. If you see her often and spend time with her, not telling her will make it fester. If you rarely see her or dont spend much time together, you wouldnt need to say much. Maybe something casual when you are talking when together. You could also not say anything if this is just her personality. If that is the case, don't do it as she will fly off the handle and it will just negatively affect you.", "NTA.  Sounds like this behaviour is not just at the wedding.  At some point you need to confront her for always being awful to you and she owes you an apology. I doubt you will receive it a d she might not change how she treats you .  Be prepared to have an argument and to take space from her.  But she does deserve to be called out and you deserve to be treated better - even if it means distancing yourself from her.", "Personally I wouldn't bring it up but I would distance myself.  If she notices and asks about the change then you could express how she makes you feel.", "This is good advice.\n\nShe doesn't deserve you. Invest your time and effort in those who do.", "> Do you think she doesn't know her treatment of you sucked? \n\n\nShe may not. In my experience a lot of assholes are completely out of touch/delusional.\n\nI\u2019m a firm believer I telling people (especially family) WHY you are cutting them out of your life.\n\nSome people just take family for granted. Let her know what she did, rather than leaving her to assume you just happened to lose touch.", "Precisely what I was going to say. I'm sorry the sister was an AH to OP but this would accomplish nothing and just make a bunch of people angry with OP. YWBTA my suggestion for OP is to write a long letter detailing how awful the day was as catharsis and then burn it.

Her spouse just stands there. He is a great guy.", "Her idea and yes she has always treated me this way. I would love advice on how to act when someone rolls their eyes or has bursts of freak outs at you.", "It\u2019s not just the wedding day though. It was all of the events according to OP. I also hate the idea that the bride gets a pass for treating OP terribly just because it\u2019s her wedding. Especially when she was perfectly nice to everyone else it sounds like.", "No. Being the bride doesn\u2019t make her behavior ok. And why should OP\u2019s sister not be told how awful she was being just because the day has passed?", ">I bet a lot of the snapping and eye rolling is just you looking for things to be hurt by.\n\nOfficially the dumbest thing anyone has ever said on reddit today.", "Are you kidding me? No stress or situation warrants treating others as lesser human beings. She is NTA, she should just drop the sister and go NC.", "So OP isn\u2019t allowed to be hurt by how her sister treated her and bring this up to her at a reasonable time when it won\u2019t ruin the wedding? That sounds like a great way to have a healthy relationship with someone /s\n\nOP isn\u2019t trying to make her feel bad. She\u2019s trying to tell her sister that she won\u2019t be used as a punching bags when her sister gets stressed. OP did her best to put on events at her own expense and wasn\u2019t given so much as a thank you it sounds like.", "Lmao at this comment. Snapping and eye rolling is how the sister shows her loooove. Hahaha. Such a dumb statement", "Based on your description of her behavior, she doesn't sound like someone who is going to change. I think you need to ask yourself what talking to her is going to accomplish.", "Someone who is always nasty isn't going to suddenly be nice during a stressful major event.  You shouldn't have expected her to change and you should stop doing things for her.", "You calmly say \"I'm sorry but you don't get to talk to me/ treat me that way\" and remove yourself from the situation.  (And you continue to do that until their behavior changes.)\n\n\nShit on me once? Shame on you.  Shit on me a hundred times?  Shame on me for letting you.", "Then if you confront her she's not likely to change anything.   I'd just hold my head up high and have as little to do with her as possible.   Just because she asked you to be her MOH doesn't mean she's going to change her behavior toward you.  I'd bet a nickel your Mom probably told her to hold to tradition and do this and you were the victim of her bad behavior.    You did the best you could in a horrible situation but I feel you were kind of the scapegoat for her stress that day.   She doesn't sound like a very nice person.   Anyone who rolls their eyes at me gets a \"Oh really?\" surprised look right back.", "Then you shouldn\u2019t have accepted. It\u2019s too late now.  YWBTA if you complain now. Just avoid her as much as possible. If you\u2019re asked why, then you can tell her you don\u2019t like the way she treats you.", "Op- regardless of it being ancient history now- your feelings about it are still valid, and your feelings were hurt. \n\nI literally did this with my own sister. She treated me like crap during her own wedding and never apologised. I was living in the UK at the time and flew back to Australia to be there for this event and I never received so much as a thank you. \n\nIt was the straw that broke the camels back. This behaviour was not unexpected from her - not to mention that my mum just \u2018wanted to keep the peace\u2019, which meant that I had to suck up my feelings for the sake of some stupid family crap. \n\nI wrote her a note a few weeks after the wedding saying that I was upset, but not surprised by her behaviour towards me at her wedding, and to not contact me for a while. \n\n5 years later, I am still having spats with my sister about her behaviour towards me in a variety of settings, and my relationship with my own mother was also a little damaged- only this year did my mum admit that I became the scapegoat for whatever was going on with her at the time. \n\nWe are both over 30. \n\nTldr- It is not the wedding that is the issue- it is the fundamental relationship. Have a deep think about what you really want from her going forward, and if you are less likely to have kids before her, be prepared for family to not help you out with whatever you decide going forward with your relationship.", "You tell them to stop and you walk away.  Then you reduce contact with them.  Stand up for yourself.", "Send her the following text:\n\n\"(Sister's name), you've always treated me like garbage and your wedding was the last straw. I'm cutting contact with you.\"\n\nIf anyone else takes issue with it, tell them to pound sand.", "Yes, it was all events leading up to this. My sister has always treated me off and on this way. I was hoping for such a special day and memory she would be happy and not so cruel. Her talking about me behind my back to the other bridesmaids was the worst.", "this should the the top comment wtf is wrong with people.", "No one said anything like that. Just that eye rolling is not some huge affront. If one of the key offenses OP can level against her sister is that she rolled her eyes at her, maybe OP is overstating the cruelty.", "I don't think you are the AH for hoping for a good memory with your sister. But it sounds like to me you have been given many instances When your sister's actions towards you have been unpredictable or conditional. She also doesn't sound like someone who can take stress very well. \n\nAt this point, OP did you take this occurrence as a lesson? Basically not to put yourself in this position of catering to your sister's events like this. Not to set yourself up as her whipping boy.", "I have an older sister who treated me the way for years. after her making me cry one to many times we no longer talk. I say people like this are genuinely 'Sad Inside' and younger sisters bear the brunt of their anger. fuck that.", "Then it sounds more like you were hoping that the happiness of the day would roll on to you , but if  she never treated you well, her wedding day wasn\u2019t going to be she was nice to you.\n\nI feel like she actually took advantage of that fact that you couldn\u2019t say anything to treat you badly.\n\nI agree that you should not confront her , just fade away and go low or no contact. \n\nI doubt even if you confronted her she would admit  to her treatment, more than likely she tell everyone you\u2019re jealous of and trying to create drama to get attention.", "I say this with empathy, but I don\u2019t think your sister is going to get better towards you. Confronting her will most likely only make you feel worse as people like her will spin your words around and she\u2019ll somehow end up being the victim, and you the perpetrator. Do you live together? You said saying anything to your parents won\u2019t help ( which tbh you are both grown adults, and it\u2019s not you parents responsibility to monitor or punish grown adults) which kind of leads me to believe you all live together? Hopefully not. I would ( if you still live together) move out and distance yourself. If you don\u2019t live together, just ignore your sister from here on out. She has always treated you poorly and no amount of effort on your part is going to change that. You deserve better, but only you can make that happen.", "Do you think your sister would be receptive to this kind of talk? What do you think would come from it?", "I honestly think a lot of people missed details in the post. There\u2019s literally no reason for OP\u2019s sister to treat her and only her like this."]}
