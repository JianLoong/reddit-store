YWBTA.", "What was she supposed to do? Leave the pregnant belly at home? She didn't make any announcement and she tried to steer the attention back to you. \n\nYTA.

This bridezilla stuff is ridiculous. Your cousin attended your wedding, that's all that she did. It doesn't matter what dress she wore. It doesn't matter that she is pregnant. It wouldn't matter if she is prettier than you. You have a fundamental misunderstanding of what a wedding is.", "YWBTA   \nYou clearly showed yourself that she downplayed it.

People don\u2019t owe you a pregnancy announcement before they\u2019re ready (the \u201crule of thumb\u201d is to wait until after the first trimester, but even then loss can happen so some people are just more cautious), and they also don\u2019t have to seclude themselves until the baby is born. Yeah, it might have been nice to have a heads up, but pregnant people do not owe you an announcement. And, even if she did make an announcement, was she expected to tell all of OP\u2019s guests, some of whom she probably doesn\u2019t even know? \n\nAlso, the bump shows at different times for different people, so she may have still been pretty early on. OP said the dress wasn\u2019t tight, so I don\u2019t know what this poor girl was supposed to do other than not show up at all. I get it, I understand that you want your wedding day to be about you and your spouse, but I honestly don\u2019t think being this mad at her is a great look.

If she announced the pregnancy beforehand, she would have been in trouble for taking away from the excitement of the upcoming wedding.

She came in quietly and only acknowledged it when asked. It sounds to me like she was very considerate.", "YTA Maybe she announced it to her immediate family. Obviously there are other people at weddings that you wouldn't announce your pregnancy to. Like others have said, she can't leave the belly at home.", "Major YTA. \nYour cousin didn't announce anything, you are simply mad because she didn't hide her pregnancy. \nWhat is she, guilty of looking pregnant? \n\nWhy don't you just ask everyone to show up dressed in burqas the next time you get married, so that no bodily form whatsoever will be visible. \n\nYou need to get over yourself.", "No, just reply \u201cnot going\u201d to the invitation, you don\u2019t need to provide a reason for your absence", "I'm just trying to understand how people think other people's lives stop because of your wedding.

That's upstaging \n\nCalm down and be happy for your cousin. YTA\n\nBut has it always been like this people expecting all attention on them at a wedding? I always thought of it as a big party, celebrating with friends and family. Talking about our lives, dancing having fun. We never just sit there and talk about the bride and groom the whole time. She couldn't help being visibly pregnant", "Not only will you be TA, but you\u2019re also incredibly self-absorbed and possibly delusional to think that she did this maliciously. \n\nYou just keep saying you get a strong sense or a feeling that she did this on purpose with no actual proof and literally proof to prove that the opposite is true; she tried to downplay it and make the day about you. \n\nPlease get over yourself.

I had a wedding. But I do not understand why people feel that any attention paid to anyone other than the wedding couple on a wedding day is bad/wrong/grounds for anger and resentment.

You're not obligated to go regardless. If she is noticeably pregnant, she could've easily made the announcement ahead of time so it didn't become the focus of your wedding (versus not showing yet but someone figuring it out because she's not drinking or something).

Send a gift and be done with it.\n\nHer showing up to your wedding in a semi form fitting dress was definitely asking for some type of attention; rather intentional or not, especially if she hadn\u2019t announced yet.

At face value of OPs text,  I agree with your judgement!\n\nLooking at this from another perspective that's been on here before, I think the general consensus is,  if you're pregnant enough to be showing at a family wedding, and in good standing with the family,  go ahead and make the announcement to family ahead of time,  or talk to the bride. OPs undercurrents are either petty and jealous,  or stem from this person regularly overshadowing them. Can't tell without context,  which is why I agree with the judgement.\n\nMost likely OP is totally a being unreasonable, people should be able to announce their pregnancy when they want.  Knowingly  walking into a family wedding while quite obviously pregnant maybe should have qualified for a heads up ahead of time though. It seemes unlikely that the pregnant one couldn't have done a zoom call or email with the closest guests ahead of time though. Being pregnant enough for belly fawning usually means it's a really noticeable bump, like 4+months (medical issues notwithstanding).\n\nEdit: fixed some typos", "What did you expect her to do?

She didn\u2019t GET pregnant at your wedding, she didn\u2019t borrow a mic, she didn\u2019t wear a couture dress that said BABY ON BOARD across the tum, she didn\u2019t get engaged, and she didn\u2019t cause a scandal.

The pregnancy would have taken all the post wedding excitement", "Yeah, how can she talk about her wedding and honeymoon when there is a fresh pregnancy announcement", "YTA \nI am so confused by brides who think a wedding is about no one else getting any attention at all.

Or would that detract from them staring at you in your white dress?\nShe is pregnant. That's not something you can conveniently time for other people. Had she announced it before the wedding, family still would have been excited to see her for the first time after the announcement. \nSo basically, no one attending your wedding is allowed to conceive within nine months of your wedding to ensure full attention is on you?\nAbsolutely ridiculous.\nHad she taken the mic and announced her pregnancy, I would understand. Had she shown up wearing a dress with an aquarium belly and a picture of a foetus floating in the belly, I would understand. But she literally just... attended your wedding while pregnant.\nGrow up.", "NTA I don\u2019t attend showers even for family. I drop off a gift and congratulations card.

She literally hasn't DONE anything, and you have nothing but suspicions about your wild theory that she did it all just to persecute you. What was she supposed to do - wear a burlap sack?? If her pregnancy upstaged you, that was just your tough luck. The fact that she DIDN'T explicitly announce further argues against your theory - she easily could have, but showed restraint instead. And she even said what any reasonable person would say - \"thank you, but let's let today be about the happy couple\" - and you've somehow worked it into your conspiracy theory as just an act? Unbelievable.  \n\n\nAlso you don't do yourself any favors talking about how you think people were \"audacious\" for daring to talk about lovely news such as a wanted pregnancy.

There are plenty of people who do not even announce their pregnancy until a certain point. If she is further along than about 3 or 4 months, it could be that she doesn't want the judgement of being 19 and pregnant. \n\nSome women show early. My pregnancy was noticeable at 9 weeks. Some of that was because I was very thin (not by choice). That's the only reason I announced before the end of my first trimester. \n\nYou just sound bitter and jealous.

The fuck is that? Why is the family celebrating instead of sad or scared for her? How long has she been with this man?

It\u2019s a wedding, it celebrates the love between two people, that kind of love cannot be overshadowed by a pregnant belly, a kid crying, a missed DJ song\u2026 if it is, it means you want the pomp and ceremony of a wedding more than what it actually represents and that\u2019s\u2026 sad.", "YWBTA. For a lot of reasons:\n\n1.

What would you have liked her to wear, an oversized muumuu to hide her belly?\n3.  You mentioned in another comment that she should have announced it before your wedding - Firstly, you don't get to decide when someone announces a pregnancy, and secondly even if she had announced it before the wedding do you really think nobody would have congratulated her or made comments to to her in person?\n\nIf you don't want to go and you can't be happy for her then don't go.

The OP however was discussing wether or not to invite the said pregnant cousins to the wedding, because she would be showing at that time and hadn\u2019t yet told many family members.
