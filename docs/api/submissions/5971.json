At one point, she tried to downplay things and I overheard her telling certain family members that the day was about the bride, but I felt she conveniently timed that right as I passed by their table. \n\nI do feel her intentions were malicious and obvious.

YWBTA.", "What was she supposed to do? Leave the pregnant belly at home? She didn't make any announcement and she tried to steer the attention back to you. \n\nYTA.

This bridezilla stuff is ridiculous. Your cousin attended your wedding, that's all that she did. It doesn't matter what dress she wore. It doesn't matter that she is pregnant. It wouldn't matter if she is prettier than you. You have a fundamental misunderstanding of what a wedding is.", "YWBTA   \nYou clearly showed yourself that she downplayed it.

People don\u2019t owe you a pregnancy announcement before they\u2019re ready (the \u201crule of thumb\u201d is to wait until after the first trimester, but even then loss can happen so some people are just more cautious), and they also don\u2019t have to seclude themselves until the baby is born. Yeah, it might have been nice to have a heads up, but pregnant people do not owe you an announcement. And, even if she did make an announcement, was she expected to tell all of OP\u2019s guests, some of whom she probably doesn\u2019t even know? \n\nAlso, the bump shows at different times for different people, so she may have still been pretty early on. OP said the dress wasn\u2019t tight, so I don\u2019t know what this poor girl was supposed to do other than not show up at all. I get it, I understand that you want your wedding day to be about you and your spouse, but I honestly don\u2019t think being this mad at her is a great look.

If she announced the pregnancy beforehand, she would have been in trouble for taking away from the excitement of the upcoming wedding.

She came in quietly and only acknowledged it when asked. It sounds to me like she was very considerate.", "YTA Maybe she announced it to her immediate family. Obviously there are other people at weddings that you wouldn't announce your pregnancy to. Like others have said, she can't leave the belly at home.", "Major YTA. \nYour cousin didn't announce anything, you are simply mad because she didn't hide her pregnancy. \nWhat is she, guilty of looking pregnant? \n\nWhy don't you just ask everyone to show up dressed in burqas the next time you get married, so that no bodily form whatsoever will be visible. \n\nYou need to get over yourself.", "No, just reply \u201cnot going\u201d to the invitation, you don\u2019t need to provide a reason for your absence", "I'm just trying to understand how people think other people's lives stop because of your wedding.

That's upstaging \n\nCalm down and be happy for your cousin. YTA\n\nBut has it always been like this people expecting all attention on them at a wedding? I always thought of it as a big party, celebrating with friends and family. Talking about our lives, dancing having fun. We never just sit there and talk about the bride and groom the whole time. She couldn't help being visibly pregnant", "Not only will you be TA, but you\u2019re also incredibly self-absorbed and possibly delusional to think that she did this maliciously. \n\nYou just keep saying you get a strong sense or a feeling that she did this on purpose with no actual proof and literally proof to prove that the opposite is true; she tried to downplay it and make the day about you. \n\nPlease get over yourself.

I had a wedding. But I do not understand why people feel that any attention paid to anyone other than the wedding couple on a wedding day is bad/wrong/grounds for anger and resentment.

You're not obligated to go regardless. If she is noticeably pregnant, she could've easily made the announcement ahead of time so it didn't become the focus of your wedding (versus not showing yet but someone figuring it out because she's not drinking or something).

Send a gift and be done with it.\n\nHer showing up to your wedding in a semi form fitting dress was definitely asking for some type of attention; rather intentional or not, especially if she hadn\u2019t announced yet.

At face value of OPs text,  I agree with your judgement!\n\nLooking at this from another perspective that's been on here before, I think the general consensus is,  if you're pregnant enough to be showing at a family wedding, and in good standing with the family,  go ahead and make the announcement to family ahead of time,  or talk to the bride. OPs undercurrents are either petty and jealous,  or stem from this person regularly overshadowing them. Can't tell without context,  which is why I agree with the judgement.\n\nMost likely OP is totally a being unreasonable, people should be able to announce their pregnancy when they want.  Knowingly  walking into a family wedding while quite obviously pregnant maybe should have qualified for a heads up ahead of time though. It seemes unlikely that the pregnant one couldn't have done a zoom call or email with the closest guests ahead of time though. Being pregnant enough for belly fawning usually means it's a really noticeable bump, like 4+months (medical issues notwithstanding).\n\nEdit: fixed some typos", "What did you expect her to do?

She didn\u2019t GET pregnant at your wedding, she didn\u2019t borrow a mic, she didn\u2019t wear a couture dress that said BABY ON BOARD across the tum, she didn\u2019t get engaged, and she didn\u2019t cause a scandal.

OP is being dramatic af\n\nEdit to add YTA", "Yeah it doesn\u2019t work like that \ud83d\ude44", "What sort of dress would hide an obvious pregnant belly? Even a flowy dress would sometimes not work depanding on how you are carrying. Also maybe announcing before the wedding was not possible. People have this fear to announce if they are not 3 months in, and since we have no details regarding how along she was, we can assume that the cousin did not want to announce and hoped she wouldn't show, but failed. But everything is just an assumption.", "I know it come on quick, but surely you can make a decision the week before and let people know beforehand if you're showing that much.  It can be hard though.  At the end of the day, people are going to notice you've got a belly OR they're going to notice you wearing something super loose fitting.  A girl can definitely get stuck between a rock and a hard place though.", "Yes. Potato sacks are the only appropriate dress wear for pregnant cousins at weddings \ud83d\ude44", "Exactly! What is this idea that people just sit in awe talking about the bride lol, OP is not only TA but also childish.", "Hell, even if you already own a house, there are plenty of better things to do. Get better insulation, get solar panels, a heat pump, maybe the bathroom needs work? Or the kitchen? Get a better/safer car, prepare for kids, or even just out it aside for when you do need it.", "I remember on the Otfice how they literally filmed Angela from the neck up and you could still tell the actress was pregnant.", "Exactly! A friend told me she could see it in my face. I was only 8 weeks along or something like that.", "Exactly, here in the USA, everything wedding related is marked up very high. Hair, Makeup, flowers, cake, dj, photography and etc. All of it has like a 30% mark up rate. Currently, our total budget is anything less than $20,000 and that\u2019s with 74 people (kids included).", "I got pregnant both times the first month of trying - we always said all he had to do was throw his trousers on the bed.", "I feel this in my soul. I had my 3 in 4 yrs. I actually went out on maternity leave pregnant and came back from maternity leave pregnant again. With 2 of my 3 kids I had unprotected sex once (each, obvs lol)", "We don't know the timing, some people don't want to announce really early.\n\nI'm inclined to cut the pregnant teenager some slack.", "You were wearing regular jeans until 20 weeks?! Jeez pregnancies ARE different, I'm 17 wks and have to stop wearing super soft pre-pregnancy yoga pants because they started to give me stomach aches. Same thing happened with trousers (slightly oversized ones too) before I was 12 wks! \nSorry about your back pain, can't be pleasant \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nPS OP I'm sorry to say this but YTA. Why do you think your family can't simultaneously be happy for both you and mum-to-be? Also I don't get the impression she was trying to steal the day, she was just... Well... Pregnant?", "So I have a question--did you have trouble going into labor? I have a severely tilted uterus and I don't go into labor on my own. I always have to be induced. I give birth fine.  I'm in labor a long time, but otherwise everything is normal. It occurred to me that my tilted uterus might be why I have to be induced. I've never met anyone else with this."]}
