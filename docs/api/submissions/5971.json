YWBTA.", "What was she supposed to do? Leave the pregnant belly at home? She didn't make any announcement and she tried to steer the attention back to you. \n\nYTA.

This bridezilla stuff is ridiculous. Your cousin attended your wedding, that's all that she did. It doesn't matter what dress she wore. It doesn't matter that she is pregnant. It wouldn't matter if she is prettier than you. You have a fundamental misunderstanding of what a wedding is.", "YWBTA   \nYou clearly showed yourself that she downplayed it.

Yeah, it might have been nice to have a heads up, but pregnant people do not owe you an announcement. And, even if she did make an announcement, was she expected to tell all of OP\u2019s guests, some of whom she probably doesn\u2019t even know? \n\nAlso, the bump shows at different times for different people, so she may have still been pretty early on. OP said the dress wasn\u2019t tight, so I don\u2019t know what this poor girl was supposed to do other than not show up at all. I get it, I understand that you want your wedding day to be about you and your spouse, but I honestly don\u2019t think being this mad at her is a great look.

She came in quietly and only acknowledged it when asked. It sounds to me like she was very considerate.", "YTA Maybe she announced it to her immediate family. Obviously there are other people at weddings that you wouldn't announce your pregnancy to. Like others have said, she can't leave the belly at home.", "Major YTA. \nYour cousin didn't announce anything, you are simply mad because she didn't hide her pregnancy. \nWhat is she, guilty of looking pregnant? \n\nWhy don't you just ask everyone to show up dressed in burqas the next time you get married, so that no bodily form whatsoever will be visible. \n\nYou need to get over yourself.", "No, just reply \u201cnot going\u201d to the invitation, you don\u2019t need to provide a reason for your absence", "I'm just trying to understand how people think other people's lives stop because of your wedding.

That's upstaging \n\nCalm down and be happy for your cousin. YTA\n\nBut has it always been like this people expecting all attention on them at a wedding? I always thought of it as a big party, celebrating with friends and family. Talking about our lives, dancing having fun. We never just sit there and talk about the bride and groom the whole time. She couldn't help being visibly pregnant", "Not only will you be TA, but you\u2019re also incredibly self-absorbed and possibly delusional to think that she did this maliciously. \n\nYou just keep saying you get a strong sense or a feeling that she did this on purpose with no actual proof and literally proof to prove that the opposite is true; she tried to downplay it and make the day about you. \n\nPlease get over yourself.

I had a wedding. But I do not understand why people feel that any attention paid to anyone other than the wedding couple on a wedding day is bad/wrong/grounds for anger and resentment.

You're not obligated to go regardless. If she is noticeably pregnant, she could've easily made the announcement ahead of time so it didn't become the focus of your wedding (versus not showing yet but someone figuring it out because she's not drinking or something).

At face value of OPs text,  I agree with your judgement!\n\nLooking at this from another perspective that's been on here before, I think the general consensus is,  if you're pregnant enough to be showing at a family wedding, and in good standing with the family,  go ahead and make the announcement to family ahead of time,  or talk to the bride. OPs undercurrents are either petty and jealous,  or stem from this person regularly overshadowing them. Can't tell without context,  which is why I agree with the judgement.\n\nMost likely OP is totally a being unreasonable, people should be able to announce their pregnancy when they want.  Knowingly  walking into a family wedding while quite obviously pregnant maybe should have qualified for a heads up ahead of time though. It seemes unlikely that the pregnant one couldn't have done a zoom call or email with the closest guests ahead of time though. Being pregnant enough for belly fawning usually means it's a really noticeable bump, like 4+months (medical issues notwithstanding).\n\nEdit: fixed some typos", "What did you expect her to do?

She didn\u2019t GET pregnant at your wedding, she didn\u2019t borrow a mic, she didn\u2019t wear a couture dress that said BABY ON BOARD across the tum, she didn\u2019t get engaged, and she didn\u2019t cause a scandal.

But OP\u2019s cousin would have to be an absolute moron to not expect that to happen if she hadn\u2019t told anyone about her pregnancy prior to the wedding.", "If that were the case why would they be gushing to everyone about how excited they were? \nYou have valid points, they just don\u2019t appear to fit this situation (granted we only have one side to it but work with what we\u2019ve got). Ultimately if you don\u2019t want to announce you\u2019re pregnant at all for whatever reason you wouldn\u2019t go out in public once it became noticeable, socially acceptable or not people are going to assume.", "I\u2019m sorry your parents and sister went through that", "I dont mean something in the mail. But many people send out texts, calls or even social media posts. Some way to let family know without showing up on someone else big day announcing it.", "For me I was raised to take other people feelings in to consideration. I won\u2019t announce something that could take the spotlight away from whoever day it is. \n\nWhen i was pregnant with my second I waited to tell family until after my sister event. Even though family was in town for I knew it would take away from her day. \n\nIts common for family to get very excited about someone being pregnant and get distracted very easily by it. Knowing that I just wouldn\u2019t want to take away from someone else. If I couldnt hide it then I would tell before that event so that person still feels special.", "Nope. You are wrong.", "Honestly OP says that they should have announced it before but that would have made it worse because then OP would be complaining about all the prewedding attention the cousin is getting. \n\nThere was no way for the cousin to do something right here", "OP\u2019s cousin is only 19 years old and she\u2019s married to a 25 year old man. I wouldn\u2019t expect someone who is that age and in that kind of relationship dynamic to know how to navigate a situation like this. She\u2019s probably still trying to wrap her head around becoming a mother. OP\u2019s wedding was probably the least of her concerns.", "It's okay. She just turned 7 in August and just had surgery, so in recovery. But she is a spitfire of a child other than that! We have no idea where this energy of hers came from.", "I bet big bucks the close family knew.", "I too was raised to take other people\u2019s feelings into account, and we see \u201cannouncing a pregnancy\u201d as a self-centered thing to do. There are so many people who are dealing with infertility, who aren\u2019t married/partnered and see pregnancy as just another win that they can\u2019t have, and additionally, a lot of people see it as bad luck to announce until the baby has actually arrived. The people who you see fairly often will know you\u2019re pregnant, but the people you don\u2019t see that often will STILL be congratulatory that you\u2019re pregnant even if you \u201cwarn\u201d them ahead of time. The cousin was wearing a loose dress and steered convo back to OP. Other people focusing on the cousin were the ones being rude, but the cousin couldn\u2019t have done anything differently without being self-centered or lying.", "I think you will find that most agree with me..", "That may be. They would also be wrong :)", "What was she supposed to do? Wear a tent?", "Not wear such a revealing dress would have been more considerate, for one thing. Why be so extreme? Either tent or tight dress? Those are the only options you can imagine?  \n\nReading between the lines, it seems like the cousin was smug, rather than humble and genuinely trying to redirect back to the bride.", "It wasn't a tight dress...\n\n>not an overly tight fit", "OP specifically says it *wasn\u2019t* an overly tight dress."]}
