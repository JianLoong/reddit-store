I'm a nerd for fantasy like LOTR, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Wheel of Time, etc. While the aesthetics will be medieval style, I'm having pretty standard food and drinks. The issues are coming from a cousin having a problem with the dress code. I'm putting on a colored dress code for the partygoers based of the Seven Ajahs of the Aes Sedai from Wheel of Time, Red Green Gray Brown Yellow Blue and White. Its a normal casual or semiformal attire, I'm not expecting anyone to wear wizard robes or queen ball gowns or the like. Nor am I expecting anyone to look like they just dipped their clothes in monochromatic paint either. Just wear regular clothes that clearly show which color Ajah they have chosen to dress for.  I myself am choosing the Blue with a Old Navy Blue plaid button up, light blue tee, and blue jeans. Everyone has so far been on board with this with no pushback except 1 family member.\n My cousin, \"Vanessa\", is the one I've been arguing with about this dress code. We are not nor have ever been close. She's always been condescending to my side of the family over some family drama decades ago. But she has confirmed she is coming other family. Vanessa first reached out to clarify my dress code on the email invites. I explained the 7 colors and why and did tell her that she can dress in normal casual clothing as long as her chosen Color is obvious and predominant. She seemed not too pleased but didn't mention anything at the time. later she reached out again after she found out a friend of mine she likes will be attending and said to me she plans on wearing this new Pink and black dress she thinks will make her look appealing for this friend. I was kind of taken back that she needed to bring this up to me now with my party still a month and half away at this time. Sort of felt like she was trying to rub it in my face that she was going against how I wanted my party to be. anyway I told her that while I'm ok with her wanting to go for this friend (she is not his type btw, I don't think it will go anywhere), I would really want her to adhere to the Dress code I wanted. She pushed back that its a dumb rule and that i shouldn't be trying to make her and others \"play along with my nerdy Dungeons and Dragon delusions\". While this was making me angry but I had other things to do that day, I responded with fine she can wear whatever she wants but it does disrespect the look I wanted for my birthday. she then just hangs up on me.

Yep, Google exists, but it's better etiquette if the person who is asking people to dress in theme goes to the trouble of providing a few footnotes with the invitation.", "I went to a wedding once as a +1 (groom had x number of work friends to invite, so went with another coworker) and wore a paisley dress that was mostly black & white with bits of green as it was on St. Patrick's Day. Had a wonderful time, it was a lovely evening and I enjoyed celebrating my friend and his amazing & beautiful wife! I found out weeks later that the bride was upset that I wore green, although this dress code was never communicated to my date or myself either on the invitation or by the groom. I felt badly about it because I obviously didn't intend to upset anybody, but it wasn't intentional at all! I'm ok with attending any event and adhering to a dress code, especially for a themed party - I just didn't *know*.", "I stand by that, within reason of course, that anyone hosting a social gathering is allowed to dictate certain terms that most if not all the guests should be expected to abide by. And it is actually quite common for Weddings to have some kind of dress code.", "Sounds like a blast!", "They stem from the same issue with her, so it is the same.", "I did and except for my cousin, everybody seems to be fine with the dress code.", "NTA- Don\u2019t listen to these people. It\u2019s not like your birthday dress code is strict. She probably has a bunch of options in her closet already. She\u2019s just mad because she wants to use your birthday party to sink her claws into one of your friends and thinks that gives her the right to supersede the purpose of the party, which is to celebrate you! I would uninvited her from the party. Why would you want someone there that doesn\u2019t even care enough about you to adhere to a very broad dress code? \n\nBtw I\u2019ve been to a birthday party with a \u201cmust wear as much gold as possible\u201d dress code and it was fun to see how far everyone took it.", "Dress code for a wedding is generally about the level of formality, not what colors the guests are allowed to wear (except for the no white rule, which I also think is stupid). But getting upset that someone isn't going to wear the right color is just silly, especially for a birthday party. Your birthday comes every year; it's not some super special event.", "Thank you. I say just let the less than pleasant redditers respond to me however they feel about my post and I'll just respond in kind.", "So I'm not allowed to want a Party that I am planning, paying for, and hosting to have a certain very easy term in place just because I like the idea because YOU think its silly and not a super special event? Seems a little dismissive of you.", "Then why the F are you on AITA?  Getting other people opinions and judgment is literally the point.", "I mean, you're allowed, but everyone else is allowed to think that you're being a bit overly precious about the whole thing.", "You're allowed to do whatever you want, but calling your 32nd birthday party a \"super special event\" and getting upset when people don't wear what you want them to wear is a bit much. Sorry that it seems a little dismissive to you, but I don't know anyone else in their 30s (or older) who plans huge birthday parties for themselves.", "Don\u2019t listen to all the negative Nelly\u2019s here. Every other person acting like it\u2019s the most obnoxious thing ever to have a theme for an event. Apparently no one is allowed to have costume parties, any kind of fancy dress, any kind of black tie or any other type of event that involves any kind of interest, whimsy or fun.\n\nHeaven forbid you plan an event that you actually want to have \ud83d\ude44. Maybe these people either don\u2019t get invited out much or just have really boring social circles. \n\nTheme parties are fun. Sci-fi is fun. Comic con is fun. Costume parties are fun. \n\nIf someone doesn\u2019t want to participate in sometime than they just need to not go. If it\u2019s not to their tastes than they just need to not go. I don\u2019t even know why someone would insist on going to an event they don\u2019t want to be a part of. \n\nIt\u2019s like someone going to comic con who doesn\u2019t like comics and sci-fi or someone who doesn\u2019t like football going to a football game or someone who doesn\u2019t like drag going to a drag ball.\n\nIf there\u2019s an event that isn\u2019t to your taste than just don\u2019t go to it! Why is that such a hard concept for people to grasp? If someone is having a themed event and you don\u2019t want to participate in the theme than you just opt not to go. \n\nYou don\u2019t just crash the party and decide the hosts plans don\u2019t matter and you can just do what you want. \n\nYou know every time there\u2019s a post on here about someone bringing kids to a child free wedding it\u2019s near always unanimous the person should uphold the rule or decline the invitation. Why is that the only time it\u2019s appropriate for someone to have a rule for their own event?\n\nWhy is it appropriate to just totally disregard the plans a host put a lot of time and effort into that matters to them for *their* event just because \u2018you don\u2019t feel like it.\u2019\n\nWell\u2026then *don\u2019t go*. The event is not yours. When you have an event you can put as much or as little effort into the plan and theme as you want but if you don\u2019t want to participate in a theme than your choices are 1)suck it up and deal and maybe have fun despite having to step a bit out of your comfort zone or 2) don\u2019t go and let those who do want to have fun and enjoy their event.\n\nNTA your party your choice.", "No need to faux curse at me for a post you aren't obligated to read much less respond to. OP's don't just post things and let other anonymous people on the internet judge and ridicule them without getting to respond back.", "But it's his super special 32nd birthday party!", "I think you are incorrect here, lots people throw themed parties ,  if the cousin does not like it they do not have to go.", "Mmm wasn't aware my other family and friends are thinking less of me for this. Thank you for clueing me in on what you heard form my social circles.", "I never said my birthday was a super special event. You mockingly said that in your first response above earlier.", "Never said it was super special. You seem to want to make that point for me.", "Yeah and at 32 he should be able to have the party he actually wants. If you want to participate in the theme you go, if you don\u2019t want to than you don\u2019t go. It\u2019s not that hard to figure out.\n\nJust because your friends are boring and unimaginative doesn\u2019t mean everyone has to be. \n\nHave a great party op. The people who will negatively judge you for this aren\u2019t people worth your consideration anyways.\n\nIt\u2019s always so sad when people avoid being themselves Simply because they\u2019re too afraid others will disapprove or think it\u2019s weird.\n\nWeird just makes life more interesting.", "Why r y\u2019all bullying the nerd? Let him be.", "Themed parties are fine, but I\u2019m not going to get butthurt if someone doesn\u2019t want to do it.   I\u2019m not the fun police, and it\u2019s not my job to tell grown-ass adults what color to wear, and if I didn\u2019t do a good enough job selling the theme, that\u2019s kind of on me.  \n\nAlso, a wheel of time themed birthday party seems kind of lame anyway.  \n\nI would be pretty embarrassed telling someone \u2018you can wear red, if you\u2019re all about \u201cFocusing on castigating the wrong and dangerous use of the One Power which mostly consists in capturing male channelers and bringing them to the Tower for gentling.\u201d\u2019.   Like, seriously, I cannot possibly judge someone for not wanting to be a part of that.", "I mean, I have no clue what your friends and family are thinking about it.   \n\nBut based on your own description of the situation, that\u2019s what I think.", "You're the one making such a big deal out of your birthday party \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yes, he can do whatever he wants for his birthday. But getting mad enough that his cousin won't strictly adhere to the color theme that he needs to post about it is kind of childish. Just let it go. If she's the only one who isn't in theme, she's just going to make herself look silly.", "Because it's childish to expect your guests to wear certain colors for a birthday party and get mad when they say they want to wear something else. He can do whatever he wants, but it doesn't make it any less unreasonable.", "Let them. I'm sorry me just wanting to have a party with a theme seems to perplex and weirdly offend them."]}
