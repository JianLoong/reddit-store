Back when I got engaged to Alec, his dad and stepmom brought up some old hurt feelings to me that didn't feel appropriate. So Alec's mom died in a car accident when he was 5 years old and when he was 7 his dad married his stepmom, though she lived with them for a few months prior, since he was 6. From what I have been told Alec doesn't see his stepmom as his second mom. His stepmom and dad consider her just as much his mom as his mom but they didn't erase his mom. Alec just never loved his stepmom like a mom. He has younger half siblings from his dad and stepmom. He has his grandparents on both sides and aunts and uncles from both sides who have always been very active in his life. When Alec graduated from high school his mom's family and some of his dad's family were saying how proud they were and how proud his mom would have been. Alec's dad and stepmom heard Alec saying how much it sucked not to have his mom there, and that growing up without his mom meant someone was always missing, and he really felt it that day when he would have loved to have her there. They promised him she would be so proud and that he would always have a mom, even if she wasn't able to be with him.\n\nHis stepmom's feelings were hurt and his dad was annoyed that Alec didn't think at all that his stepmom had at least be there as a mother figure for him and didn't leave him entirely without a mom. Once her hurt gave way some, his stepmom was angry also. That only intensified when my husband chose a photo of before his mom died as the only photo he had on display in his first apartment when he turned 22 (his first solo apartment). I knew him then but didn't know his family much. His dad had asked him why just one photo and he said he wasn't much of a photo guy but had a special fondness for that one so wanted to be able to see it whenever. Some other stuff they didn't like was my parents knowing his stepmom was his stepmom and that Alec looks like his mom.\n\nWhen they first brought this up to me I told Alec about the stuff they were trying to involve me in and he spoke to them, said if they had a problem to speak to him, they had a talk (wasn't there to witness it) and he said it shouldn't happen again. It kind of did right before the wedding and we didn't do any traditional stuff. They felt it was a pointed effort for him not to do a special dance with his stepmom. It wasn't, but they took it that way.\n\nThey have continued to bring this up to me and I would tell Alec always. He said maybe we should have some space from them. I decided last time FIL approached me about all this alone to tell him to stop bringing me into it and encouraged him to speak to Alec and find a way to let it go so we don't go no contact over it. FIL said I shouldn't have married Alec if I didn't want to be involved in the family.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: Cut this out in edits but Alec did say to redirect them to him with this if they bring it up to me.

They expect Alec to.

I decided to read through comments to see what sort of additional info was already posted before i made my comment.\n\nIm gonna offer a few different perspectives.\n\nThe first will be that of a step parent, as i entered my stepsons life when he was 2\u00bd (hes now turning 8 this year) \n\nThe second will be as the child of 2 separate step parents\n\nThe third will be as a parent thats both biological and a stepparent(my daughter will be turning 4 this year)\n\nFirstly as a step parent it is insanely difficult and nervewracking entering into a little humans life not fully knowing if you will in fact be with the parent for longterm or short term. Not knowing why their parent is single, not knowing the child at all etc. Etc. It is a process. Even after 5 years i still struggle and am scared im gonna fuck my stepchilds life up somehow while trying to equally be a parent to their half sibling. Simply put, i can somewhat understand the step mothers frustrations. However, those are not frustrations or pressures that should be put on the child. It is not the childs fault that they are getting a step parent. And it is completely on the shoulders of your FIL to have made that transition as easy as possible. Without enough info on the 15+ years of your husbands stepmothers involvement i wont go as far as to say shes TA. Thats reserved for FIL\n\nSecondly and thirdly. I watched my mother stay married for far too long to a man who was more deadbeat and useless than my own biological father who left when he found out my mother was pregnant and then marry a man who is now more my dad than any other person ever could be. My mothers first husband entered my mothers life when i was 3. My mothers second husband, my dad, (being a father/mother and being a mom/dad definitely are 2 totally separate worlds) entered my life when i was 17. And it took less than a year before i was calling him dad. And it was not forced. Neither my mother nor my dad encouraged it or discouraged it. It was not in the title of parent, but within the actions that my dad took. I wont go into them as they are very personal, but i keep them close to my heart. But it leads me to the ultimate point.\n\nThe reason husband doesnt accept step mom as a mom, is because she was unable in some way shape or form to fill the need for parental love and affection that your husband needed growing up (from my point of view of course)", "NTA\n\nI am weary of stepmoms trying to replace actual moms. It's just not gonna happen unless actual mom was a really bad mom, and maybe not even then. Tell FIL and SMIL to knock it off, you're not interested and it's not your problem. She's got some nerve, imho, trying to be \"mother\" and not stepmother. Once you try forcing yourself it never goes well.

It really does look like she's trying to erase his mom, no matter what they claim otherwise. \n\n**They have taken several important events in Alec's life and taken away his joy in these events by focusing on how stepmom is upset** because his mom is being remembered, grieved, missed.  His graduation, his first apartment, what your parents know about stepmom, the wedding, they keep finding something to make it seem like he's offending them due to having any feelings of his own mother.  **This is really cruel,** what they have been doing to him.  \n\nIf stepmom is having issues over his mother, **she should get therapy, not blame him**, over and over, for having reasonable feelings, valid feelings. \n\nAlec has tried to talk with them about it, and they are trying to involve you in this now.  \n\n *They have continued to bring this up to me and I would tell Alec always.* \n\nGood for you.  Teamwork helps in such cases.\n\n*He said maybe we should have some space from them. I decided last time FIL approached me about all this alone to tell him to stop bringing me into it and encouraged him to speak to Alec and find a way to let it go so we don't go no contact over it.* \n\nHe's probably right.  If reason and logic won't work, and apparently, they won't, the next thing to do is to protect yourselves.  Stepmom needs therapy to see why her obsession with erasing his mom, and her behavior certainly is doing this, even if her words don't, is so very wrong and harmful to all of you.  It's very possible that protecting yourselves is going to mean taking a break from them.  **They don't seem able to see how wrong their behavior is.**\n\n*FIL said I shouldn't have married Alec if I didn't want to be involved in the family.*\n\n**FIL is wrong.**   \n\n**This isn't a 'family issue.'**  It's an issue from two people who are trying to create a fantasy for themselves, and trying to force this fantasy on Alec and on you. It's a dysfunctional issue, not a family one.  **They punish Alec every time he shows his grief and they see it.**  They do this even when they think it might be the case, like with the wedding dance.  They are trying to make his grief not exist, **as if his grieving for his mother,** at times in his life when it's reasonable to miss her, **is somehow offending them.  They are more interested in supporting stepmom's fantasy than in supporting Alec's need to grieve** as he grows up and misses someone important.  That's not what family does.\n\nThis is something that should never have been brought up at all, not to Alec, and not to you, not at any of these events.  They should have handled their own feelings and not burdened him with them.  **He's not responsible for how they don't like that he has reasonable feelings**.  \n\n**FIL is wrong.  Family supports and comforts** us in time of grief, **they don't fuss at us until we don't dare to mention our feelings at all.**  Children growing up without a parent will have grief pop up at all kinds of odd times, and that's natural and normal.  \n\n**FIL is wrong.  Family doesn't punish us for missing someone we love on special days** by creating scenes and being offended because they are not getting the attention they want.  **Family doesn't try to compete with a dead person, they respect our feelings and our needs, and that the person is gone and that means pain.**  Family doesn't add more pain to that, they try to lighten that load, not increase it.  FIL and SMIL are doing this all wrong, and that's on them, and always has been.  A break might be exactly what you two need.\n\n**You being part of the family has nothing to do with FIL and SMIL and their dysfunctional behavior.**   I'm guessing that FIL said this to punish you, because you weren't taking their side in this mess they made.
