Back when I got engaged to Alec, his dad and stepmom brought up some old hurt feelings to me that didn't feel appropriate. So Alec's mom died in a car accident when he was 5 years old and when he was 7 his dad married his stepmom, though she lived with them for a few months prior, since he was 6. From what I have been told Alec doesn't see his stepmom as his second mom. His stepmom and dad consider her just as much his mom as his mom but they didn't erase his mom. Alec just never loved his stepmom like a mom. He has younger half siblings from his dad and stepmom. He has his grandparents on both sides and aunts and uncles from both sides who have always been very active in his life. When Alec graduated from high school his mom's family and some of his dad's family were saying how proud they were and how proud his mom would have been. Alec's dad and stepmom heard Alec saying how much it sucked not to have his mom there, and that growing up without his mom meant someone was always missing, and he really felt it that day when he would have loved to have her there. They promised him she would be so proud and that he would always have a mom, even if she wasn't able to be with him.\n\nHis stepmom's feelings were hurt and his dad was annoyed that Alec didn't think at all that his stepmom had at least be there as a mother figure for him and didn't leave him entirely without a mom. Once her hurt gave way some, his stepmom was angry also. That only intensified when my husband chose a photo of before his mom died as the only photo he had on display in his first apartment when he turned 22 (his first solo apartment). I knew him then but didn't know his family much. His dad had asked him why just one photo and he said he wasn't much of a photo guy but had a special fondness for that one so wanted to be able to see it whenever. Some other stuff they didn't like was my parents knowing his stepmom was his stepmom and that Alec looks like his mom.\n\nWhen they first brought this up to me I told Alec about the stuff they were trying to involve me in and he spoke to them, said if they had a problem to speak to him, they had a talk (wasn't there to witness it) and he said it shouldn't happen again. It kind of did right before the wedding and we didn't do any traditional stuff. They felt it was a pointed effort for him not to do a special dance with his stepmom. It wasn't, but they took it that way.\n\nThey have continued to bring this up to me and I would tell Alec always. He said maybe we should have some space from them. I decided last time FIL approached me about all this alone to tell him to stop bringing me into it and encouraged him to speak to Alec and find a way to let it go so we don't go no contact over it. FIL said I shouldn't have married Alec if I didn't want to be involved in the family.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: Cut this out in edits but Alec did say to redirect them to him with this if they bring it up to me.

Don't let them put you in the middle.", "NTA. I have a serious complicated relationship with step parents and parents. Thankfully it\u2019s being resolved in a healthy way slowly every day, but the forced step-parent dynamic, I\u2019m very familiar with. \n\nBut, OP, they\u2019re not going to change. They expect Alec to. Instead of actually trying to bond with him they\u2019re trying to force him to bond with them and that\u2019s not how kids (of any age with their parents) work. \n\nThey also seem regretful of honoring Alec\u2019s mom but they were probably trying to find ways to help him cope with the fact he didn\u2019t have time to grieve before a stranger was forced into a roll that had already been filled. A 5/6/7 year old will not grieve the same as an adult. They messed up but they\u2019re continuing to do so by forcing a dynamic that was never there.", "NTA. \n\nThere is nothing to be gained for you by getting involved in this situation. Step-mom needs to grow up a bit - she's not his mom, she never was his mom, she never will be his mom, and acting like his feelings aren't valid is just going to drive them farther apart.", "NTA. I find their attempts to get you to pressure your husband to accept his stepmother over his own decease mom to be awful behaviour.\n\nYour FiLs reasoning that you shouldn't have married if you didn't want to deal with family, I suspect to be a deliberate manipulation of the truth in order to justify both his, and his wife's poor behaviour.\n\nI think they should consider themselves fortunate that they still have a relationship with your husband. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that folk have gone NC over treatment like this.", "Plus I have to say, if he's acted like this since they got married when he was 7 and he's now in his 20's...they missed a *ton* of opportunities to try and change this in a more healthy way (therapy, developing a relationship with him without being overbearing, etc) and don't seem to realize that recognizing her as a stepmom doesn't make their relationship automatically bad or lesser.", "That's totally how it feels to me.", "That's exactly how it feels to me too. The first time I had no idea why they were mentioning it to me and I questioned if they were trying to make me run from Alec or something. Over time I started to wonder if they wanted me to get involved and talk Alec into changing how he feels about what his stepmom is to him.", "I certainly feel like they want me to convince Alec to feel a different way or to view her in a different light. At first I thought it was their way of chasing me off but now I do believe they think I should try to influence him regarding her more.", "He didn't ask for space. He said it might be something to consider and has told me before to let it go to him (I might have cut that sentence out when I edited my post). But he didn't say we were 100% taking space from them.", "Exactly that ship sailed years ago, they need to let it go before completely alienating him.", "Tbh if he brings it up again I'd be tempted to say \"why are you asking me to help your wife compete with my husband's dead mother\", but that may be too blunt.", "Yeah the fact that FIL keeps bringing it up to you after Alec's talk with them makes it come across as \"we know what he said, but you're his wife which means you have Magical Wife Powers to convince him\" or similar bs.", "Also, OP says that FIL and stepmom aren't trying to erase Alec's mom, but they're also mad that OP's parents were told that Alec's stepmom is his stepmom, *and* that Alec looks like his mom? OP may be giving them a little too much benefit of the doubt on the \"not trying to erase\" thing.", "I meant as a child. When he was younger photos of his mom were still present, she was still spoken about and everything. But I feel like their attitude might have changed now. At least I think they regret doing all that and maintaining her memory instead of seeing if Alec would rely more on his stepmom as a mom instead of just as a stepmom. That's just my assumption though. But I base that on what they have said and what Alec told me as well.", "Ahhh I see. Yeah it definitely seems like their attitude has shifted, taking issue with him looking like his mom is a particular \"yikes\" moment, literally something he is unable to control because genetics.", "I get the feeling, again, this is just how I picked it up, that it was more about my husband bringing it up. When he met my parents they did talk about his mom and he likes to talk about her and he's proud of looking like her. But it felt like it was a sore subject for my ILs. In part I wonder if they have just let so much fester inside of them (because this stuff was brought up by them to me and not to Alec) and now everything that hasn't changed since he was younger is just a no go for them.\n\nOnly displaying/caring about one picture of his mom\nTelling others about his mom\nTelling others his stepmom is his stepmom\n\nIt's like all the stuff that hasn't changed is now a problem because they expected it to, at some point.", ">It's like all the stuff that hasn't changed is now a problem because they expected it to, at some point.\n\nThis is hitting the nail on the head, I think. It sounds like they expected Alec to change on his own and are pissed he didn't. So instead of just accepting the stepmom - stepchild relationship (which is totally fine! It's not lesser and it's weird to be jealous of somebody who's dead!) they're trying to force the issue.", "Yeah, and it makes me question if they did all that stuff for him, to help him and do the right thing by him, or with the idea in their mind that it would win him over for her to become his mom as well.", "Ugh I totally understand why Alec never saw stepmom as mom.. dad and stepmom probably shoved \u201cstepmom is mom\u201d down his throat all his life.

Yes, Stepmom may be upset that she could not have that kind of relationship, but she is an adult and needs to understand that she cannot have the relationship that she would have liked, and it cannot be forced.
