My wife especially. We took her first to a child abuse specialist and then therapists and two psychaitrists. They didn\u2019t find any evidence of abuse but the first psychiatrist diagnosed her with ODD and the second psychiatrist said she didn\u2019t have ODD but did have symptoms of a personality disorder but she couldn\u2019t be diagnosed until she was older.

Often, people with a personality disorder seek help repeatedly and are misdiagnosed several times over a period of years with more common mental health conditions (anxiety, depression) before receiving the correct support.

Kudos to you and I hope OP gives this some solid thought for the future. \n\nThat being said, I don\u2019t think this kind of method is appropriate **until and unless** BOTH of the following are true:\n\n- Kayla apologizes and has made concrete steps that indicate she has changed (e.g. entered and sustained therapy, spoken openly about her past behavior and acknowledged its impact on her mother, on her father, and on other family members, begun and sustained medication for a diagnosed psychiatric condition)\n\n- OP\u2019s wife has had time (and therapy) to process the past few years and feels willing to listen to an apology from Kayla and consider a rapprochement. \n\nIt may help OP to think of this as what they would do if Kayla had deliberately inflicted physical injury on a sibling - repeatedly. Her behavior was just as abusive, and in abusive situations, safety (physical and psychological) comes first. \n\nIt may also help OP to think about the following possibilities: \n\n1. If they are correct that the issue is internalized misogyny, then the parents allowing Kayla to use her mom as a \u201cverbal punching bag\u201d in order to keep the (relative) peace may have been well intentioned and the best they could come up with without professional guidance, but it may also contribute to her ongoing disordered thinking by validating the idea that it was \u201cok\u201d to sacrifice the mom\u2019s well-being because women are less-than and mothers come third in line behind children and fathers. In a way, \u201cchoosing\u201d the mom now may help communicate that she (the mom most directly, but indirectly, Kayla herself) *matters* and is worth equal status. \n\n2. If whatever is wrong with Kayla has a diagnosable basis, this is who she is until she is able to access successful diagnosis and treatment. Periods of not being around her mom don\u2019t \u201csolve\u201d the underlying issue - she will seek out a new victim or victims. At home, this may become a sibling or, later, an extended family member (e.g. nibling, in law). At school or work, this may be a fellow student, the homeless woman who begs at a nearby intersection, a helpful pet, or a colleague. OP can\u2019t necessarily do much about this without seeing it unfold, now that Kayla is an adult, but they can deny Kayla the illusion of a perfect Norman Rockwell family life that she can use to gaslight any other victims into believing this isn\u2019t a pattern for her. \n\n3. If there was some kind of abuse or other event that OP / OP\u2019s wife wasn\u2019t privy to, holding Kayla to account for her behavior as an adult will either cause her to separate from the family fully (painful, but possibly necessary for her to get away from memories of abuse) or work on how to process that trauma (hopefully with psychiatric help) so that she becomes able to voice this truth. Those are terrifying options, but if there was some abuse, it may be the only way for her to find peace.\n\n4. Kayla\u2019s behavior has impacted and is continuing to impact her younger siblings, and seeing how OP and OP\u2019s wife disengage with love, for their collective safety, until and unless Kayla is able to participate in effective treatment, may be critical to their future relationships with family, friends etc. I hope they are in counseling individually and maybe as a unit to address this - their sense of what\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d may have been deeply warped. The worst outcome for them might be them concluding that blood relatives have an infinite free pass, and that \u201clove\u201d means never drawing a boundary or establishing consequences. This could result in them being abused in later relationships, or abusing others. \n\n5. Finally, I would urge OP to consider that Kayla\u2019s behavior seems to have switched at puberty. It would be worth considering that she may have a chemical imbalance or other genetic condition that is \u201cunleashed\u201d by the onset of adolescent hormonal changes. Its critical to discuss with the other children in the family any potential genetic aspects to this, if they exist (consult doctors, psychiatrists, and perhaps any family history on both sides to see if there\u2019s any evidence of this kind of behavior \u2026 back when, people who \u201cacted out,\u201d especially women, might have been institutionalized and not spoken of thereafter, to preserve appearances). Doing so might inform their own reproductive choices or help them prepare for how to address this in their future lineage. \n\nI wish OP, his wife, and Kayla luck, and peace.", "This weird scaling system is dumb.

You ruined the relationship with your mother, have made zero effort to fix it, are STILL treating her poorly,  and you are no longer welcome.\u201d", "A rough time at college? Interested to hear more about this. Could it be that nobody puts up with Kayla's BS? She doesn't deserve to be in your home any more. I know it's your kid but she's putting in zero effort. Get some ridgid boundaries in place, no more chances. Your wife deserves better.", "She\u2019s having a rough time cuz she she is an abusive person who needs help. You need to distance yourself from her because she will think you agree with her.", "She's probably having a rough time because other people don't put up with her crap. Good.", "of the 1000+ comments here ..no comments support your daughter. \nTake note of that.  NTA", "You say that your wife threw up \u201cwhen she found out\u201d\n\nDoes that mean that Kayla asked you if she could come home for the break, and you told her yes before talking to your wife about it? \n\nIt sounds like you have been letting Kayla abuse your wife, in her own home, without any consequences. You are complicit in that abuse by inviting your wife\u2019s abuser to your wife\u2019s home. \n\nKayla should be forced to deal with her own \u201crough time\u201d, on her own, unless she can show remorse for her actions and demonstrate that she has changed by acknowledging what she did, apologizing to your wife, and making up for it with appropriate respectful behavior. She\u2019s an adult, if she can\u2019t make it right by your wife the consequence should be going no contact with her. \n\nAre you and your wife in therapy? Separately or together?", "It sounds like it's time to stop giving her a safe space to come home and be a bully. I'm sure its not intended but you and your wife basically enabled this behavior. You tried everything when she was a child but now that she's an adult you have a way to enforce consequences. She doesn't get to come home for the holidays if she's awful to her mother.", "She may be having a rough time at college because she can\u2019t get along with people and resorts to bullying them. Maybe she treats others the way she treats her mom, you really don\u2019t know how she acts at college. But it\u2019s time you require her to act like a decent human being in your home - so if she can\u2019t treat her mother with decency and respect, don\u2019t let her come home. Of course she will throw a fit, but it might be the wake up call she needs.", "If he didn\u2019t allow her to come to their house for the holidays then he wouldn\u2019t have made this post, so no, this sub wouldn\u2019t be judging him at all\u2026 if she\u2019s really the problem that OP says she is they need to prohibit her from coming to their house at all, for his wife\u2019s sake.", "Yes, she could have anything that is overlapping in the dark triad. \n\nThey also won\u2019t diagnose minors with APD. They wait until 18. The fact her psychiatrists have said they would have to wait to diagnose her, seems to be a pretty big indicator that they think she may have an APD. \n\nHer father also said that their professionals found no signs of abuse or trauma\u2014sociopaths don\u2019t necessarily have to experience trauma to develop that way. Sounds like it\u2019s wiring problem.", "The trigger was the \u2018abandonment\u2019 of the mother staying back when they sold their house in her preteen/early teen years. It moved her mother to an unfavorable position. OP has said she exhibited signs of a PD that she was too young to be diagnosed with. \n\nBPD is becoming an widely used term but some people with BPD do behave like this often and esp. towards someone who sharply lost favor. There\u2019s many presentations and some are astonishingly more negative and less empathetic than others.", "This is a good point -- abuse is thought of as parent --> child, but anyone can abuse another person in a family unit by making them a scapegoat.", ">its not her fault\"\n\nThat's never part of it. Blame isn't part of the game.", "I think that she shouldn\u2019t be invited to begin with.\nTo me, they should have gone NC since Kayla is now an adult and she hasn\u2019t changed as her behavior demonstrates.\n\nStill, they probably thought mom going away for a few days was the easiest and fastest solution to Kayla coming home, especially because they don\u2019t know what her reaction would be to 1)boundaries or 2) being required to stay in an hotel, regardless of how it would have been explained to her.\n\nIf her mom still does love her as OP says she does that could probably factors in the decision making process as well especially since she knew her daughter was having a hard time as school to begin with (as stated by OP in the comments).\n\nIt makes sense in a way that they chose probably the \u201csafest\u201d and less dangerous option especially considering that they clearly have not set up any boundaries with Kayla before and they don\u2019t know how she would react.\n\nETA: I wonder if they also though about the possibility of Kayla finding out that she is not allowed home because of her mom\u2019s mental health/her behavior against her mom.\nNow Kayla hates her mom for no apparent reason, not being allowed in what she considers her home because of (in her eyes) her mom would change that . Would that escalate the behavior? \nIf they thought about this, it makes even more sense why they acted the way they did", "Yes, it\u2019s that kind of social club. It\u2019s not technically a sorority but it\u2019s basically her college\u2019s version of one in my view.", "I am so sorry.", "Well that's a Kayla problem not a mom problem.", "I agree with your reasoning and want to add - Kayla knows where her parents house is. She doesn't know where the hotel is. \n\nI can't see her saying *\"Stay in a hotel so I don't stress out Mom? Sure!\"* I'd bet dollars to donuts if they'd tried it, Kayla would be beating down their door yelling obscenities at her mother. A hotel was the safest option.\n\nThat poor woman.", "Then the siblings and dad should have met her at a restaurant or somewhere else. Mom being pushed out of her own home wasn\u2019t right.", "An inpatient facility is a real option here. It seems like Kayla may have an untreated psychiatric disorder. She would be able to be evaluated, diagnosed and treated while being under 24/7 observation. Her treatment would go much faster than if she was getting outpatient treatment once a week. She could then transition to outpatient care. I hope OP considers this.", "Then daughter would call OP an AH for not supporting her and choosing wife over her and OP would post here. \n\nBanning her is the solution tho", "I know. I\u2019ve had quite a few clients with antisocial personality disorder. I used to see clients on a mental health probation who just got released from jail or prison so I saw quite a bit of personality disorder diagnoses in there. Basically way more cluster B than others, though. \n\nWe have to wait past 18 for any personality diagnosis not just antisocial. Most of us won\u2019t even do it at 18. Her brain isn\u2019t even fully developed yet. Her personality isn\u2019t completely stable this young. \n\nWe also can note someone has traits of one without meaning they meet criteria for a personality disorder. A lot of people have traits of one without meeting full criteria. \n\nI noted that trauma can do it to point out that a lot of things can make you lack empathy. She\u2019s not directing it at everyone or expressing it in general. Just at mom which gives me pause.\n\nI honestly do wonder if there\u2019s some missing reasons here. Maybe OP can let us know what personality disorder the mental health professionals were thinking.", "Personality disorders are generally thought to develop at a much younger age than that. If Kayla does have BPD, the initial stressor (or, more likely, repeated, chronic, ongoing stressors) would more likely have occurred/began in infancy or as a toddler.", "Not trying to contradict you, but as someone with BPD who hates her narcissistic mother, I've had my fair share of triggers, but it's never been constant like OP is describing. It was more of a \"now I hate you and want nothing to do with you\" to \"hey, you wanna go shopping new clothes?\" an hour later.\n\nThen somewhere in my late 20's I basically decided that actively hating and trying to get her to love me at the same time was unfeasible and started treating her like I'd treat a distant cousin.\n\nIf OPs daughter had BPD, I think she'd fluctuate more between \"mom, you stupid\" and \"mom, please love me\".  She'd definitely show some empathy at some points.", "And since it was the mother who sold the house, in Kaylas mind she is therefore the person to blame for the move.", "Yes very well said. All true. \n\nBut it seems to me like this easy decision is going to cost them dearly in the long run. \n\nThey're teaching Kayla she can run her mom out of her own home by telling Dad she's \"having a hard time.\" \n\nAnd I don't envision any world where Kayla's behavior improves if they try to put up boundaries the NEXT time. It'll be worse. \n\nSo what's safer, dealing with it now or teaching her she can do this and THEN trying to put boundaries up next time?\n\nBut I'm with you I'd be no contact with anyone who treated me or my wife this way. It doesn't sound like that's where OP and his wife are at though, as you said.", "They shouldn\u2019t let her come back at breaks full stop then. Dad and brothers could visit her if they feel they should. She\u2019s 19 though not a child. They don\u2019t have to have her back at all now if she\u2019s this abusive and awful.", "Sadly I don\u2019t think they have any way of actually improving Kayla\u2019s behavior, boundaries or not.\nImproving would require that Kayla, AT LEAST, attempts to work on herself and starts to take accountability for her action and she clearly doesn\u2019t want that.\nShe chose to stop therapy.\nNow she is mad and turning on his dad because he took a \u201cstance\u201d that basically took her emotional punchball away and THAT is probably the reason she went home to begin with.\nIf she is not willing to work on herself, this could end either with NC or someone getting hurt/in jail if the behavior escalates to physical.\n\nIt\u2019s really quite sad that, per OP\u2019s comment, he now basically hates Kayla for what she is doing to his wife while her mom is being abused, but she still loves her like this.", "I agree that the daughter should have been cut off a long time ago.\n\nI'm just saying I understand why the Mom would choose a hotel over her daughter staying in one."]}
