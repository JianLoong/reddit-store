When it does happen it's extremely frustrating for me especially when we are in the mood (which is less common these days than when we first met..given age and just being busy/tired). \n\nI've noticed over time that sex has become a lot less passionate and more one-sided. For example, the other night I was exhausted, but he was feeling it so I went along anyway. Once he finished I was happy for him and we went to sleep (I was really tired anyway). So the next night I was in the mood and he was a bit busy (doing stuff for us), but I started playing with him anyway.... Well this resulted in him finishing in a couple mins (or less?). He apologized and offered a second round later (although I know that likely wouldn't happen). I was upset and just said I was going to sleep. Usually once he finishes, he just continues on with whatever he was doing before and I'm left sexually frustrated.\n\nIn my frustration I brought up the idea of an open relationship so I could have my sexual needs met. We've actually discussed this before (a couple years prior) and he was on board, but then he felt it wasn't balanced when I eventually met with an old fwb. At the time this was about the difference in our libido (my sex drive being a lot higher).\n\nWe started discussing what happened the first time we attempted the open relationship and how I didn't end up doing anything with the fwb and my husband backtracked on the idea...this convo didn't really go anywhere other than him denying he was upset about it and just felt it wasn't a balanced arrangement. \n\nHe seemed annoyed, so I was wondering AITA for bringing this up right after he finished so quickly?\n\nI love my husband very much, but I'm don't know how else to get this feeling taken care of. For the record I don't like oral sex so that doesn't work. We do use toys/fingers to help, but sometimes that doesn't quite do it for me.

Don't give him sex if he's only going to do it for his pleasure. Next time he initiates, push him away but don't leave him wondering. Tell him you will 'only give him sex if he can get you cum (or something like that) because you want pleasure from sex too'. If you give him sex knowing its probably going to be bad there is no incentive for him to improve. This where *you* need to change and will require some willpower. \n\nThen set a date for sex and remind him that this is his chance to prove he can get you off. Keep doing this every instance *he initiates* after giving you bad sex previously. Only once he levels up his game then you can consider stopping this. \n\n[This will test to see if he will take the initiative to improve. If he does nothing or gets angry, this is a bad sign.] \n\nDon't forget to reward him for doing what you want. This doesn't always mean sex either. \n\n2. Tease him as well during this time. Wear sexy stuff but don't indulge him. Let it be like gift wrapping he can only open under *certain conditions*.\n\n[This will also test if he still has genuine attraction for you. Indifference is a bad sign.]\n\n3. See a sex therapist. Try anything other than the open marriage route.", "Suggest therapy with sexuologist.

I do think though you'd both need to give some serious thought about HOW you'd do it. There are so many different ways. E.g. I assume you'd be each others' 'primary partners' since you're married, meaning you put each other before anyone new in your lives. You'd both have to feel very secure in your love for each other and your own self confidence (and therefore making each other feel confident with constant reminders of how much you love each other). I believe that no one is above jealousy, so discuss how you will both deal with that when it comes along. Put some rules in place e.g. a veto card or not hooking up with anyone in a situation where you're together. Obviously some people will be off limits like your siblings or your kids' teacher etc! Discuss how much information you'd each want about what the other person gets up to. It requires putting in a lot of emotional work but it definitely can be done.

Try other things and communicate nicely about it.", "You can start with a normal fleshlight, sure. The point I am trying to make is that you both have allowed this issue for way too long. Let's be honest.\n\nAre you even aware that most men can train themselves to have multiple orgasms? That there are ways to train the body so there is an orgasm without ejaculation, super hard, but doable - in which case, a dude comes but doesn't even need to get out of you, he just stops for a moment and then resumes?\n\nComing too quickly is such a common issue I am honestly appalled nothing has been done. This is on both of you. Because even if your satisfaction is perfect - his isn't. Life is also about sex if you're into sex. And you have allowed your partner to live his entire time with you without knowing what it's like to have a fucksession that lasts and lasts. We want our sexual experiences, even with one partner, to vary. The fact neither of you did anything at all to not address symptoms - but the core issue - boggles my mind. It's one solution to use fingers, toys, try again, whatever.\n\nBut the core issue is that he is coming too quickly. And there is soooo much that can be done even without involving doctors. Creams that are supposed to extend, condoms with a special thingy that makes it harder to come, fleshlights and tons of masturbation equipment for men...\n\nFemale and male orgasm are a little different biologically. For women who are capable of orgasm, learning how to have multiple orgasms is not that insanely difficult. But in men it is and most of the time the ideal solution is to learn to come dry.\n\nBut what would a doctor or sex therapist do for you? If you took their advice and ideas to heart, they would solve the problem. This is so fucking common, there is so much that can be done, so many things to try.\n\nAlso I understand you two are not teenagers, but like... I always thought that if I had a sexual partner with this issue I would just expect them to either practice on their own to last longer or practice with me. One scenario - we start, I give him an orgasm as soon as possible and then we can focus on long term pleasure because second orgasm comes harder. Second comes quickly too? Then third. If he refuses to try to improve this - this is the issue then. There is no excuse here. This isn't about him being male. This is about what matters in a relationship in which sex is an element.\n\nWhat I want to point out to you is that from my perspective both of you showed such lack of care for the other one. I mean, getting a fleshlight or a toy or a book or reading about it would be the first thing I would do after the first time this happened. You don't have to take it to doctors, but like... why are you so nonchalant about this? Why are you so nonchalant about the fact that your partner doesn't get to enjoy sex for all sex can be for him?\n\nBecause you don't need another partner or anything kinky, you two have each other, but somehow you were okay with him never knowing what it's like to have an orgasm after a longer session? So you two can finish at the same time? Fuck, hate me for what I am about to say all you want, but I accomplished an orgasm at the same time with my partner one of the first times we had sex. Because we focused on each other, because we were so attuned to each other. And with this partner I also had situations when he came very quickly sometimes.\n\nDo you see what I am trying to say overall?", "You can also suggest he tries talking to a doctor and get some treatment. Be warned though this can cause him to lash out. I dated a guy with ED once and when I suggested this he acted like i mortally offended three generations of his family and their dogs.

A lot of people downplay the importance of satisfying sex life and that\u2019s just naive idealism and they\u2019re the people who get cheated on the first. Sexual frustration will reflect in every other aspect of your life and wellbeing", "Being sexually incompatible, or even selfish, doesn't automatically mean she doesn't love him. If it was just about having sex with others, she could have easily just cheated on him. \n\nAlso I've had pretty good experiences with watching someone else rail a partner whom I could not meet all of the needs of, so idk why you'd think cucking isn't a viable option.
