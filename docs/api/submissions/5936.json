Like a screenshot from google images.\n\nThis really annoys the hell out of me. Today he asked me again. I am on a weekend trip and will come back tomorrow. We usually cook with Maggi or Knorr, which are bags of powder that you just mix with water to get a sauce or soup. I am not from the US, so idk if you ever heard of that, but the bags clearly state what ingredients other then the powder you may need. For Lasagna this is usually the pasta sheets, groud beef and cooking cream.\n\n\"What would you like to eat?\", he asked \n\"We still have those lasagna sheets, so if you could get two packs of Maggi, some ground beef and stuff, that would be great.\"\n\"Which stuff?\" \"The stuff on the bag.\" \n\"Ok, how much ground beef?\" \"Idk, it says it on the bag!\"\n\"Can you google a picture?\"\n\nThis went on with cream and also cheese until I lost my cool and told him how annoying this is. He was there in the store with me, multiple times. He cooked with me. He KNOWS which bags Im talking about. \nI expect some logic and decency. I feel like his mother. After that we brainstormed what we needed for breakfast and stuff and after some messages (Hm how about apples? Would you be able to bring white bread? etc) he asked me if I could go through my messages again and write him a detailed list. I only texted him 4 times and all was visible in the chat.

You could talk to him about it and figure out why he needs so much help all the time.\n\nEither way, this system isn't working and you need to change it.", "I mean\u2026.why can\u2019t you make a list and give it to him? \n\nIt does sound annoying but seems like it could all be avoided by menu planning and making a proper list. \n\nPlus it\u2019s so much faster to shop when you have a list organized based on the layout of the store.\n\nI\u2019m going with ESH.", "Depending on whether coke is used as a generic term or not, where you live, it will either be YTA, or ESH.  I totally understand not wanting to walk back and forth over and over at the grocery store, building the grocery list as you go.  But if coke only means coca cola, then he sucks too.", "Nta do men really want us to believe they are so incompetent that they can't grocery shop without pictures? Are we really meant to believe that men can't grocery shop independently? Men can be engineers, doctors, lawyers etc but can't grocery shop? Somehow traditionally feminine chores are just beyond the ability of otherwise capable men? Please don't be ridiculous. Your roomate is outrageous. You are not his mommy and he isn't a child.", "YTA. He's paying. \n\nWhy not get an app from the store, such as Walmart, and share the password. Add all the stuff you want into a shopping cart. Then there's no question.", "NAH about the groceries that you eat together, like the lasagna. He's in charge of buying groceries, and you'd also like him to take more charge of making decisions about groceries, which is fair. You should talk to him about it.\n\nAs for groceries that he's buying just for you, like the Coke, it's more understandable that he'd want you to give him more detailed instructions about that.", "Why don\u2019t you just tell him\u2026. Be more specific. Half kilo of mince, one can of red sauce, one packet of shredded cheese, a small knob of Parmesan cheese, 12 pack of Diet Coke (not Coke Zero) etc. \n\nSoft AH", "NTA you already gave him a list.  He can use some sort of common sense about how much to buy.", "YTA\n\nHe's shopping & paying. Make him a detailed list or do it together.", "YTA. \n\nFor someone who buys 90% of the groceries and just wants to be sure he is getting the right thing, you seem super rude. \n\nIf I were him, I'd just stop getting your groceries and let you pay for shit on your own.  Maybe that will make you be a more decent person", "ESH a little bit. It's annoying as hell when he's kind of weaponizing his incompetence BUT he's going out of his way to provide for you a service by arranging your rent payments into more shared house goods. Honestly try a grocery list app that has scanning ability like \"Out of milk\" You both can share the list with each other and then you expressively communicate to him \"You and I both have the list now and you can scan the item to see if it's the right one or not based on this list that we built....please do not text me while your picking up these items as I am busy today\" and leave it at that.", "YTA  - I think your items are unspecific.   \n\n\nIf this were me I'd be buying the cheap cooking apples that taste like crap just to be a petty cuss.  WHICH APPLES. golden, red delicious, smith, pink lady, etc?  \n\n\nAlso I hate when people ask for a meal but then I'm expected to figure out the ingredient list.  Like no I'm not doing that.", "YTA You don't like it? Good news, there's an easy fix. You can go do the shopping yourself.", "YTA Tell him exactly what he needs to get and how much. Using \"... and stuff\" is just as annoying. He may do this because of past trauma. Not wanting to upset you if he picks the wrong item or amount. I use pictures too when I'm shopping alone. I'll take a picture, send it to my wife, and ask \"Will this work? Is this enough?\" But lately, she's been good at telling me exactly what is needed so I haven't had to check with her.", "YTA. Just give him an amount! Why are you making this a thing?", "ESH yes it's annoying he can't just get the stuff.\n\nBut also he is getting things you paid for and wants to get the correct things.\n\nThere are tons of apps where you can share grocery lists with each other. Or Google docs etc. \n\nSet down a fundamental list  and help the guy out.", "If you both have apple phones you can make a reminders list and share it so you both can edit. Or make a google doc with your grocery list items. You can put specific details and avoid the constant barrage of questions each time he goes shopping. My husband and I do this and it makes shopping much less frustrating.\n\nI\u2019m going to go with ESH. You guys need to sort out your shopping system better.", "ESH. You are being annoyingly vague, and he is being annoyingly helpless. Neither of you is putting in sufficient effort to make it work.  \n\nWhen you make a grocery list for someone you should be specific and complete. He shouldn't have any intelligent questions based on the concise info you provide. Asking for pics is too much.  \n\nMilk - 1/2 gal, 2%  \nGround beef - 1 lb, 80/20.  \nCheese - shredded sharp cheddar", "INFO: is he at the store when he asks these questions? Or somewhere else?", "I'd actually go for NAH. He sounds a bit difficult for sure. However, I do the shopping for 2 households other than my own. You have no idea how many options there are until you try to pick things out for someone else. \n\nBoth of the other households say similar items, but in reality, they are quite different.  Even if one asks for Diet Pepsi and one asks for Diet Dr. Pepper, the nuances are different. My SIL wants a small pack of mini drinks. If they are out, she'd prefer a small pack of mini Dr. Pepper Zero. My mom wants a large pack of full sized cans. If they are out, she'd rather have a small package size cans or do without. \n\nEvery item is like this. There are a thousand choices for everything,  and we don't realize it, because we buy what we need naturally. For years,  I listened to the women I know complain their husband's came home with the wrong thing. It seemed odd to me they wouldn't get what their household uses. But, wow, shopping for someone else is completely unintuituve.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
