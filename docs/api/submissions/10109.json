We've been together for two years and engaged for 6 months. A year before dating, Annie ended a long-term relationship with her now ex (38m), who has a daughter, Sophie (16f). Annie has been in that girl's life since she was 6 years old, but they never married.\n\nThis didn't bother me until we got engaged. You see, Annie is very close with Sophie. They always talk on the phone, go out 2 times a week and my fianc\u00e9e rushes every time the girl has an emergency. I've asked Annie to tone it down a bit, but she insists she can't just leave Sophie alone, which doesn't make sense to me. She broke up with that girl's dad, why does she need to keep seeing her?\n\nI recently bought a house. Immediately, Annie designated one of the bedrooms for Sophie. That surprised me, and when I asked her why, she laughed, saying: where else is she going to sleep when she stays here? I immediately replied: nowhere, she's not staying here, which made her angry.\n\nI just don't see why I should set up a bedroom, spend money and time on someone else's daughter. I have enough with my fiancee paying for that girl's school, gifts and allowance. The dad is a loser with no ambition (which is why Annie dumped him), and yet he keeps taking advantage of her. Finally, they broke up, so that girl should already be out of my fianc\u00e9e's life. If she were my stepdaughter it would be different (I've dated single moms before), but biologically they're nothing. I understand that over the years they formed a relationship, but that all had to end when Annie and her ex broke up.\n\nA few weeks ago, her ex was diagnosed with a brain tumor, and he may not make it. This affected my fianc\u00e9e a lot and the girl has spent several nights in our house. I assumed it would only be for a few days until they made arrangements with extended family, but yesterday Annie sat me down and said she's been talking to a lawyer about legally adopting Sophie, since they don't have any other family and she may end in the foster care system. She would start living with us until she goes to college.\n\nOf course, I said no and told her that she must cut ties with that girl right now, because I don't want to have that girl in my life, neither becoming her new stepdad. She got very angry. She said that Sophie is her daughter, that she raised her, and that she couldn't believe that I would be so heartless to ask her something like that in this situation. At night, they both packed and left to Annie's parents.\n\nI tried to talk to them but they also called me heartless for wanting to abandon an innocent girl who's about to lose her dad. But none of that is my problem, and neither should it be my fianc\u00e9e's. So AITA for asking my fianc\u00e9e to do the right thing and stay away from her ex's daughter?\n\nEdit: It's pretty clear to me now that Annie won't cut Sophie out of her life, and it was wrong for me to ask her to. I'm fine with her staying with us for a couple of years until she's independent, but Annie wants us both to adopt her and play \"happy family\" which I think I have the right to refuse.", "created_utc": 1676560692, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/113szbu/aita_for_not_wanting_my_fiancee_to_adopt_her_exs/", "score": 939, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed. This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI (47m) I have a fiancee, Annie (40f). We've been together for two years and engaged for 6 months. A year before dating, Annie ended a long-term relationship with her now ex (38m), who has a daughter, Sophie (16f). Annie has been in that girl's life since she was 6 years old, but they never married.\n\nThis didn't bother me until we got engaged. You see, Annie is very close with Sophie. They always talk on the phone, go out 2 times a week and my fianc\u00e9e rushes every time the girl has an emergency. I've asked Annie to tone it down a bit, but she insists she can't just leave Sophie alone, which doesn't make sense to me. She broke up with that girl's dad, why does she need to keep seeing her?\n\nI recently bought a house. Immediately, Annie designated one of the bedrooms for Sophie. That surprised me, and when I asked her why, she laughed, saying: where else is she going to sleep when she stays here? I immediately replied: nowhere, she's not staying here, which made her angry.\n\nI just don't see why I should set up a bedroom, spend money and time on someone else's daughter. I have enough with my fiancee paying for that girl's school, gifts and allowance. The dad is a loser with no ambition (which is why Annie dumped him), and yet he keeps taking advantage of her. Finally, they broke up, so that girl should already be out of my fianc\u00e9e's life. If she were my stepdaughter it would be different (I've dated single moms before), but biologically they're nothing. I understand that over the years they formed a relationship, but that all had to end when Annie and her ex broke up.\n\nA few weeks ago, her ex was diagnosed with a brain tumor, and he may not make it. This affected my fianc\u00e9e a lot and the girl has spent several nights in our house. I assumed it would only be for a few days until they made arrangements with extended family, but yesterday Annie sat me down and said she's been talking to a lawyer about legally adopting Sophie, since they don't have any other family and she may end in the foster care system. She would start living with us until she goes to college.\n\nOf course, I said no and told her that she must cut ties with that girl right now, because I don't want to have that girl in my life, neither becoming her new stepdad. She got very angry. She said that Sophie is her daughter, that she raised her, and that she couldn't believe that I would be so heartless to ask her something like that in this situation. At night, they both packed and left to Annie's parents.\n\nI tried to talk to them but they also called me heartless for wanting to abandon an innocent girl who's about to lose her dad. But none of that is my problem, and neither should it be my fianc\u00e9e's. So AITA for asking my fianc\u00e9e to do the right thing and stay away from her ex's daughter?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Sure you can argue maybe the blame isn\u2019t 50/50, but it\u2019s not 99/1, either.  Both parties had plenty of chances to speak up prior to now, and plenty of indications that a conversation needed to take place, but neither did.  OP has blame for that, yes.  But so does Annie.", "OP probably thought he could get the \"foolishness\" out of his fiances head.", "Annie will save herself heartache & financial problems. Annie needs to leave him.", "I'd be disappointed that she did everything behind my back without considering how I feel, but if it's only two years until she goes to college, I'd put up with it. I just don't want to play happy family.", "I can only imagine that OP doesn\u2019t listen when people talk to him.", "This! Oh so accurate!", "Screaming avoidant attachment style", "Damn... That's worthy of a post on Murdered by Words!", "I hope those poor ex stepchildren of his are alright now that he\u2019s out of their life", "Pretty sure he doesn't need to prepare, he's already been dumped.", "True.", "That's what I think.  He planned to manipulate fiance into giving up her relationship with Sophie.  Now he's enraged because his plan failed.", "So, if it were Annie's bio kid, you'd be ok with it (you said you dated single moms before), and I suppose that if it were Annie's adopted kid from way back, you'd be ok with it (let me know if I'm wrong here, and just are against parent-child relationships that are not based on biology). But because the adoption happened after you guys got together, you can't \"play happy family\"?\n\nWhy is that?", "Then don't. Just break up with her if you can't deal with this. You can't expect your fiancee to leave her daughter for you (even if she isn't her daughter by blood its obvious they relationship is as strong)", "That is absolutely awful. You don\u2019t want to play \u201chappy family\u201d with your fianc\u00e9\u2019s daughter then you should not date mothers. \nYTA", "Sophie is her daughter. It's not on paper yet, but it's real. They have a mother-daughter relationship. ***They are ALREADY a family.***\n\nIf you choose to marry, you are joining a FAMILY, not just your fianc\u00e9e.\n\nIf you don't want to be in a \"happy family\" with Sophie, then you simply can not marry her mother.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9e has hid nothing from you. You just assumed that she would drop her daughter for some guy (you). Now you know your assumptions were wrong. And your marriage is no longer happening.\n\nTime to accept you made a mistake and move on. You don't want to have Sophie as your stepdaughter, fine. But this also means you don't get to marry Sophie's mother.\n\nIn the future, do not get involved with mothers if you can't accept their children.", "Please show this thread to your gf so she can know the real you and dump your ass, damn.", "She's going to come back from college. Weekends, breaks, summers. You should have accepted by now that she's a packaged deal.", "You\u2019ve gotta choose. Your fianc\u00e9 or your decision to not have her daughter in the house. She\u2019s never gonna choose you over her child, biological or not", "It's not behind your back, she told you about it.\n\nIt just doesn't include you and doesn't revolve around you.", "She did nothing behind your back. You are just too much of an idiot to see that she tried to include you in a decision she's already made. And you won't be playing happy family, because she's now your ex fiancee.", "His post lets on that he's probably abusive.  He tried to *order* Annie to cut Sophie totally out of her life.  That's a very bad sign.", "If she was her biological daughter or if she'd been adopted before, I would've made up my mind and be ok with it. But all this is happening afterwards, and I don't feel anything for the girl. I don't know her, we've barely talked and I can't imagine living with her or her calling me \"dad\". It never crossed my mind that she would be a part of my life.", "What a joke. The girl has had her DAD for 16 years and you definitely wouldn\u2019t be called dad. Or even a father figure. The person that is her MOTHER wants to make sure she\u2019s safe and taken care of the way she has been, by her, for 10 years. YTA for trying to put a stop to that after knowing that this has been the dynamic since well before you met your soon to be ex-fianc\u00e9.", ">calling me \"dad\"   \n   \nProbably don\u2019t have to worry about that. You don\u2019t seems like the type.", "Why do you need to feel anything to open up your home to her for 2 years until she graduates high school? Why do you assume she\u2019d call you dad? Frankly I think it\u2019s weird you\u2019d assume that\u2019s an option given that she\u2019s almost an adult and has had a present father for 16 years already. \n\nAlso why, in almost three years of being together, did you never make an effort to get to know the child your partner is spending weekly time with and considers herself a mother-figure towards? Do you not give a shit about Annie\u2019s life outside you at all?", "LMAO you think too highly of yourself if you think she is going to call YOU \u201cdad.\u201d\n\nAnnie is her mother. Her father is her father. You\u2019re just\u2026 you. \n\nThe fact you\u2019re trying to rip Annie away from her daughter is despicable. YTA.", "But why would you assume that she would call you dad? Why assume that you will play a parental figure at all? And why did you assume that Annie would not want to stay in the life of the girl she raised for the past ten years?\n\nYou've been doing a lot of assuming, and not a lot of talking to Annie. Even when you do, you don't listen,and only want things to be done your way, dismissing the fact that she has been that girl's mother for the decade like relationships like that can just be erased because you don't like it.", "She's 16 and has a father.  She was never going to call you or think of you as \"dad\", don't worry.  And now it's very unlikely to be an issue anymore.", "She would never consider you her dad, luckily for her", "yeah, you were not paying attention to Annie and Sophie, and Annie was living in total obliviousness of your obliviousness as well. So conversation never happened. \n\nI don't think you're A for not being interested in helping raise Sophie. I also don't think Annie's A for wanting to adopt Sophie. Neither you guys are A for failing to communicate sooner (otherwise, most people would be A most of times simply for communication failures)...when something is so obvious to someone it's basically a universal truth, they won't think to discuss it. \n\nBut you guys' life paths are now incompatible and you'll need to make peace with it, and not try to convince/tell Annie to not adopt Sophie. Your engagement is simply over now.", "I feel like no one is asking you to be her dad. At all. Annie wants to adopt her because she raised her, Sophie is her kid, and Annie is her mom. You would just be Annie\u2019s partner", ">You\u2019re just\u2026 ~~you~~ a colossal asshole.   \n   \n   \nFTFY"]}
