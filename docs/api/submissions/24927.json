You\u2019re not the asshole because you didn\u2019t tell him *not* to wear the heels, you explained what you thought the negative consequence would be if he did. \n\nWhen supporting trans friends, I do think sometimes you need to say how things are, not how we would like them to be. In this case, I think it is correct to say that the less contradictory evidence you show them, the more likely they are to eventually accept reality. If your brother had replied \u201cscrew them, they\u2019re never going to come round, I\u2019m just going to be me\u201d I\u2019d say he was right, and would have supported his decision to wear heels and been ready to explain things to the grandparents. I suspect that you\u2019re the same. \n\nI think what this incident perhaps illustrates is that your brother would rather have your unquestioning support, than your critical assessment; I\u2019ve found that\u2019s true with some of my friends too. And personally, I\u2019ve decided to give them what they want and need, not what I think they should get. And it\u2019s sometimes a hard job to keep my opinions about things to myself.", "NTA. You offered a suggestion. He didn\u2019t have to  change shoes. He chose to.", "Their not ignorant, they are just fucking old and I get what your trying to say but sometimes just letting things be as they are is the best foot forward. Your NTA, you mean well, but let the sibling control their own narrative.", "I get where you are coming from.  Your GPS are ignorant and you don't want the drama during and night out with them.\n\nYou know your brother.  Does Matt intentionally try to provoke people, particularly your GPs?  Or was this an innocent thing on Matt's part because this is who Matt is?\n\nI dont think you are the as to want a meal with Gps , without drama.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Fuck all. You're supporting Matt in not letting your family misidentify him and you're STILL the bad guy? No, that's some victim mentality BS. I'd tell my brother I'll either support him or not, but that it's got to be in one direction (amenable to change in the future, of course.)", "I'm going to go NTA.\n\nIt doesn't sound like you are supporting anything.  But I think we all know that sometimes its easier to \"go along just to get along\".   This is an article of clothing, its not asking to hide something.  It would be like me purposely not wearing a shirt to a family gathering that I know would cause an argument.\n\nMatt being trans doesn't negate the fact that sometimes its easier for everyone to just not rock the boat.  Not wearing heels for one dinner is not going to kill someone, nor is it repressing part of their identity.  Because what probably would happen is comments would be made by grandparents (which to be clear is  wrong) and then a big argument would start, making it uncomfortable for everyone.\n\nI will say it takes a bit of time to learn that not every argument is worth having.  I used to piss my mom off because me and my step dad would ALWAYS argue at family gatherings.  It was usually him saying something stupid, and me telling him why it was stupid, and winning the argument, which just pissed him off more.  For a long time I didn't understand why my mom seemed more mad at me than him.  But it was because she said \"you are smarter, and you could easily let this go, but instead you make it awkward for everyone\".  And that is what I was doing.  Most of our arguments were pointless, but because I needd to be right, I made Thankdgivings more stressful for others.\n\nMatt could be \"right\" in that its up to him how he expresses himself, but is that worth making it an awkward night for everyone else?", "NTA.", "NTA, just because someone transitions doesn't mean everyone around has to immediately understand or think its normal. Suggesting something that would likely keep the peace and make things less stressful for all involved isn't a asshole move. I think this is no different than telling a brother it might not be a good idea to wear a death metal tee-shirt with devil decals when going to eat with your very Christian nan. People can wear whatever they like but even for trans people there is a time and place for certain things.", "NTA for making a recommendation", "For clarity- did Laura transition to Matt, and also go 4 years younger ?", "NAH imo. Try talking again when Matt has had time to calm down. You're trying to protect him, but doing it in a way that suppresses his personality a bit. I'm sure it's a touchy subject for him after transitioning, give him a moment to relax and then explain again.", "you tried to help the situation so there won' t be a fight. But you should just let him deal with everything that comes with making a different life choice.", "NAH. He\u2019s right that you\u2019re supporting their ignorance and you\u2019d do well to avoid that in the future if you can, but you did so out of wanting him to be himself. This should be a simple apology and hugs and kisses and you guys move on with your lives. This water can be murky for even the most supportive people. Be glad you and your brother can talk openly about this!", "NTA you just pointed out how they would likely see it so he could avoid giving them \u2018amp\u2019 for their opinion.\n\nYou were trying to be helpful. He\u2019s acting very immature about this.", "NTA. \n\nPeople can wear what they want to, but sometimes it's easier to 'conform' in situations where you want to continue to have a relationship with someone who may not be as understanding.", "Waffled between NAH & N.T.A but I think NAH is fair even if he was a bit rude in the confrontation. You gave him a good piece of advice for dealing with your grand parents. If he isn't willing to cut them out, & wants them to understand this transition is who he is now. Your advice is both reasonable, polite and prudent.", "NAH except the grandparents. You wanted to protect your brother, which is lovely. But your grandparents won't change their views, no matter what shoes he wears, so let him choose his footwear as he pleases.", "All these N.T.A's are majorly missing the point here. Matt is most likely well aware of how his grandparents are, and instead of showing support when meeting with them you were trying to \"keep the peace\". I'm sure he wasn't being ignorant to their position when he chose the heels, more like trying to soften them into his way of dressing, and most likely could've done without someone shitting all over his confidence.  \n\nTrans people are not ignorant to the way others see them, but how are they going to get these people to engage and accept them if they are hiding??", "NTA. You seem to be a very supportive sister and he's lucky to have you. It was just a suggestion, but probably take this as a sign that your input on the subject isn't welcome and unless something changes, stay out of it and let him deal with it as he wants.", "NAH, because I think your comment came from a desire to support your brother. \n\nHowever, I would still apologize for unintentionally hurting him.", "My head hurts after reading this", "YTA. Mind your business. A pair of shoes doesn\u2019t define a person or their identity. Matt is a grown man and can decide what to wear.", "I know you meant well and were trying to support your brother, but yes, YTA. By suggesting he not wear heels, you\u2019re reinforcing the rigidity of gender expression. You\u2019re saying your grandparents view of gender is more important than your brother\u2019s self expression. Let him wear heels - if your grandparents say anything, just tell them the world has changed and anyone can wear heels now.", "I think you had very good intentions here, so soft YTA. What he wore wasn\u2019t inappropriate for the occasion, so really there was no need to comment on it. Doubly so, when your comments could make it appear as if you care more about your grandparents bigoted opinions than your brothers freedom of existence.", "YTA but probably not by a large margin because I believe you meant well.\n\nThe gap between a helpful word to the wise and an inprudent recommendation is not big a one but you're definitely on the wrong side of it.\n\nEdited for typos.", "Slight YTA\n\nThe fact is  your grandparents are transphobic. They don't get it, and they probably never will.\n\nI know it's just a small comment and a suggestion coming from a place of wanting to prevent your grandparents trying to justify their perspective, but it was unnecessary. Matt should not have to change the way he dresses in order to please, educate, or defend himself from your grandparents.\n\nIf it makes them dig their heels in about their bigotry, so what? They're already like that. If it confuses them, so what? They aren't interested in listening politely to explanations anyway. If they don't like it, too bad. Matt doesn't owe them a consistent or strict presentation of his gender.\n\nI can see why a little comment like that might have made him feel bitter and unsupported. It's no big deal though, just apologise. I'm sure he's knows it was coming from a good place.", "Yes. YTA. WTF business of yours was this to be the shoe police?", "Yta, you think your doing a good thing to protect him but really your reinforcing their crappy viewpoint. It\u2019s your brothers battle to fight. If he comes to you and asks how he can placate his grandparents then fine but he didn\u2019t ask. \n\nYou need to listen to your brother and stop giving him this advice.", "NAH, both your positions are reasonable. But it very much depends on the exact tone, so his reaction might be warranted as well.", "YTA. Sure, it was just a suggestion, but why would you cater to the expectations of your bigoted grandparents? Just let the guy wear what he wants without worrying about how others will judge him. It really isn't Matt who should change his behaviour here. If anything you should talk to your grandparents.", "Please mind your business and don\u2019t try to manage Matt\u2019s choices.", "YTA\n\nStop deadnaming your brother, let him wear what he wants. If that means embracing masculinity while still keeping his feminine side and looking fucking fabulous, he should go for it.", "# YTA\n\nMind your business.   This is his life and his to manage and live how he sees fit.\n\nWhether you think you're helping or otherwise, none of your business.", "Question, he transitioned, so now he is male.  \nA guy wearing very feminine clothes / shoes isn't a \"common\" thing, so is he embracing truly his male side or still \"falling back\" to his original femal side?", "So they changed their age in the transition?
