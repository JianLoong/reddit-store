It's called being in a relationship. But as I told you in another comment, it seems you have a different definition from your girlfriend's and that's something you both need to figure out together.", "You're not treating her like a partner", "Listen, let's just agree to disagree and leave it be.", "What financial decision would we be making with my raise exactly?\n\nOur finances are not merged so no it doesn't affect her. I don't ask for her payslip each month because I don't care as long as the bills are paid and we're not struggling", "That's your view on relationships. But let me tell you, from your post it doesn't seem to be her view.\n\nIt doesn't mind what I think a relationship should look like. But it does matter what your gf is expecting. And she's clearly expecting something different.\n\nAnd btw, you didn't tell her because it's none of her business. You didn't tell her because you didn't want to have a discussion with her. Very different.", "This is something you should know BEFORE you start sharing finances.  \n\n\nI don't think it matters much if you told her or not because it was only for three months and not significant in the larger picture.", "So you feel entitled to know exactly how much money your partner has even if tou don't share finances?\n\nWhy do you feel entitled to know your partners income when it doesn't affect you?", "How so? We don't have shared finances so why does she need to know everything about my salary"]}
