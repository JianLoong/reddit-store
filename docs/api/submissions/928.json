While he\u2019s never physically done anything to anyone, he has a staring problem that seems to only apply to women.  As a result of this, I can never feel comfortable in my own house and am always wearing modest clothes.  My female cousins have said that they don\u2019t want to get in the pool while he\u2019s outside, showing that this isn\u2019t only effecting me.  \n\nMy stepdad also had several failed marriages, with none of his kids talking to him for years. My mom has accused him herself of being weird towards his estranged daughter.\n\nRecently, my mom was having me take senior pictures on a dock, while i was wearing a dress.  She wanted me to lay on my stomach for one of the pictures, which would obviously expose my rear to anyone behind me.  My stepdad was literally standing directly behind me and i could not bring myself to do the pose, so I had to tell her why I wouldn\u2019t.  She got mad at me immediately saying that I was crazy, but she made him move.\n\nLast night, she wanted me to stay at my house without my boyfriend, who essentially acts as a guard for me when my mom is working nights.  I told her i would not stay there alone with my stepdad because it makes me nervous. At first, she was sympathetic, but almost immediately got pissed at me and decided to tell my stepdad all of this, and that i said he had actually physically done something.  She continued to harass me all night over this.  \n\nToday, after unblocking her number, she started bothering me again asking me to come home, instead of staying with my mamaw, which she told me to do. \n\nSince my mom is known to be the crazy one in my family some people are mad i brought this up as it will get her going again.

There's a clear pattern of behavior here.  \n\nIs staying with your mamaw a long-term possibility?", "Op, I am a 50 year old woman, a wife, a mom, a grandma, and a sexual abuse survivor, and who has worked in various volunteer capacities with abuse victims over the years,  PLEASE, PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT GO HOME TONIGHT!  \n\nLet's say you were wrong about him (for the record, I do NOT), but let's just say you were... A man who ISN'T being inappropriate in how he looks at and acts towards his stepdaughter and the other teen girls in the family would certainly NOT want to be home alone with you after hearing how uncomfortable you were about it.  A man who was NOT a sexual creeper like this, upon hearing that his stepdaughter was uncomfortable, would 100% WANT you to stay at your grandma's, where you felt safe, and would be wanting to re-evaluate why you felt so uncomfortable around them, and look at maybe getting some counseling - individually and as a family - to resolve this.\n\nA PREDATOR is going to try to minimize your feelings of being uncomfortable, is going to get off on your discomfort, and will possibly even take it to a new level of physically harming you.  Your mom, for whatever reason, does NOT have your best interests at heart right now.  There's a lot of things that could play into why that is, but frankly, at this point in time, her reasons and issues take a back seat to your safety.  \n\nBecause what your mom just did, whether she intended it or not (or whether he does it or not, but I'm afraid that the \"doing\" is more likely than \"not\" at this point) is this - she has basically given him permission to assault you, because she has said to him \"I don't believe her when she says she isn't comfortable, and I will take your side over hers when it comes to her body.\"  \n\nFor the family who says that you shouldn't have said anything to avoid rocking the boat - ask them outright how far it should go - should you allow him to progress from oggling you to touching?  How about rape?  Where's the line, and are they willing for THEIR daughters, your cousins, who are ALSO uncomfortable around him, to ALSO be oggled and possibly touched by him, in the name of keeping your mom happy?!? \n\nPlease, do NOT go home tonight, but ABSOLUTELY talk to your guidance counselor, a teacher you trust, your boyfriend's parents, or another adult.  You deserve to be somewhere safe, and you deserve to live in a home where you aren't being oggled by the adult males in the household!!!! \n\nAlso, you absolutely don't need to do this, because you don't know me, so I understand if you aren't comfortable with it, but please let us know how this works out for you, because I'm scared for you.\n\nAlso, absolutely NOT NTA!!!!!", "Nta but please tell someone outside of the family how you feel. I get the feeling there is something in his past that isn't known to you & worry for your safety. Please tell a teacher, a boss etc what is going on at home.", "Honey, you need to pay attention to your gut. If it is telling you this man is off you stay away from him! Just stay with your grandmother, your mom can threaten you, but in reality you are old enough to determine where you live. \n\nThere is a book called \"The Gift of Fear\" you should read it.  NTA", "NTA and trust your feelings something is telling you that he is not a safe person. The fact that your mom seems to have blinders on when it comes to his behavior does not make it acceptable.   Please tell a teacher or a counselor about what is going on.  I hope you can stay at your memaws for a while.", "NTA. And I am sorry you have a mom that would even accuse YOU instead of being vigilant of this guy...", "NTA.  Trust your instincts when it comes to creepers.  Do not trust people who tell you not to bring it up just because it, \"got your mom going again.\"  Those people prioritize their own peace over the safety of their female relatives and are therefore not worth your consideration.", "NTA. \n\nYou're smart and you are listening to your gut.  Something is off about this man.  \n\nAt 17, you are old enough to choose who you want to live with.  Please don't go back there tonight where you will be all alone with him.  Especially if he now knows that he makes you uncomfortable.", "NTA \n\nKeeping yourself safe is more important than hurting her feelings", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s not your job to appease your mother by putting yourself at risk. Multiple people think he\u2019s creepy - your mother just doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge that. \n\nYour family are wrong - they should be protecting you, not complaining about your mother\u2019s unreasonable response.", "They know she is the crazy one but they want you not to say something? \n\nOP, next time you go home grab your stuff and move permanently to your mamaws. If your instincts tell you to run, you don\u2019t stop to check if they are right.\n\nYou are definitely NTA. This is one instance where you must put yourself first.", "NTA and please find another living solution, especially if he knows about how you feel. Stay safe!", "Oh - adding another comment to add - run a background check on him!  They're easy to do and will let you see if he has an arrest record, a history of abuse, etc.  Also, if you're comfortable doing it (do it with another trusted adult present), consider reaching out to his estranged daughters and explaining how you are uncomfortable, and ask them if they don't mind disclosing if they had similar issues.", "Man what a breach of trust, not only to not believe you but to make him aware of how uncomfortable you feel. If he truly is a creeper she gave him a new level of fear to hold over you.  Have you talked to your grandma about this,  hopefully you can stay with her permanently and she can get your mom to back off.", "NTA, stay the hell away from your step dad, if you have an uneasy feeling about him you should trust that instinct and stay with trusted family, don't go back to that house. He sounds like a total creep and there's a reason all of his kids are estranged from him..", "NTA - sorry your mum isn\u2019t putting you first, get yourself out of that house as soon as you can.", "NTA. Trust your gut when it comes to stuff like this.", "Nta-trust your feelings", "NTA. I hope you can stay with your Mawmaw until you're out on your own. Statistically, step fathers are dangerous for young girls especially, so if you feel uncomfortable, trust that feeling and be safe.", "Your creep radar is tingling. For good reason. Make sure you are never alone with him. No matter who objects. Tell your other family members how you feel. \nNTA", "NTA - You are entitled to your feelings and shouldn't stay any place or with anyone that makes you feel unsafe.", "Your instinct is what you have before you talk yourself out of it. Listen to it. It was no accident this man happened to be standing where he was for the photos. It is no coincidence other girls aare uncomfortable around him. You need to be out of this environment as soon as you can and you are right to put in place protections against him like your BF.  What is your mother thinking? NTA.", "NTA. Your step father (SF) makes you feel creepy - so follow your gut.  You are correct, many creep-monsters marry women with young daughters for exactly this reason.\n\nStay with your ma maw and stay away from him.  If it upsets mom, so be it. Talk to mamaw and explain, she knows how men are - betcha!  \n\nDealing with an angry mom is better than dealing with rape - which is exactly where this seems to be going,  Protect yourself.", "Nta, please never go near this man or be as low contact as possible, it's only a matter of time before he does something", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
