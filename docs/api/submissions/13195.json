They tried it. Tf lol", "Wtf did I just read? Lol. She gets the time off and gets paid for it? Meanwhile you work for free? Do not send her money. NTA", "Money goes to the person who does the work. Your coworker is trying to scam you", "Yeah, why would you cover that shift if she's going to get the money. That's not how jobs work...And I'm sure she knew that and your general manager knew that. I have no idea why your mom thinks she should get the money. What was she cussing you out for though if she apparently thinks she was owed the money?", "NTA that\u2019s insane. She\u2019s trying to finesse you for money. You work the shift you get the money, period. That\u2019s how working works. Glad you stood up to her.", "If your mother ever gives you advice in life, always get a second opinion. Always", "NTA\n\nWhen you cover for someone, it means their shift becomes your shift. You are getting payed for your work. You don\u2019t pay someone else for getting you to cover their shift.", "NTA. If she wanted the money, then she should have worked the shift. The person who works the shift gets paid.", "NTA.  You covered the shift for her, so you get paid not her.  She might not have gotten fired unless this isn't the first time, she's pulled this stunt.  More likely, she got her ass chewed by the general manager and is pissed you went to him.", "NTA. she was fully trying to take advantage of you. You clocked in, it's your money. Your mom is wrong too.", "NTA has your mom ever had a job? Serous question because her advice was nonsense. Utter and complete nonsense. \n\nYou didn\u2019t get that girl fired. If she was fired she got herself fired.", "By her logic, someone could get a job there, never work a day by just getting her shifts covered and make the same wages as the people actually working.", "Nta, if I asked someone to cover my shift at work why in the world would I still get paid if someone else actually worked the shift?", "Funny how the person that worked the shift got paid for the shift\u2026 /s\n\nNTA. I don\u2019t know what your coworker was trying to pull or why your mom thought you should send the money to her but, nope.", "NTA. If she got fired, then she was fired for a reason. She can\u2019t just get people to work her shifts for her and then take the money. You do the work, you get the money.", "NTA. She is 100% scamming you. Unless your employer offers paid sick leave, they would usually onMy pay the employee who actually worked said shift.", "That is not how covering a shift works. She doesn't get paid for a day she's not working unless she uses sick or personal paid leave. She was scamming you which is probably why she got fired. You earned that money.", "NTA. You did the time, you get the money. It may have started off as her shift, but the moment she asked you cover for her (ie: given her shift to you) it became your shift. She doesn't get to have it both ways (getting the money for the shift while also not working the shift). \n\nJust to reiterate, any hours you work (doesn't matter if you get them from the manager or coworker), you get and deserve the money from those hours. And seeing as you said she was in her 20's, I wouldn't doubt that she was taking advantage of you, as others have said. It was a good thing she was fired because if she did it once, she will do it again, assuming you were the first person she did this kind of stunt to and didn't trick any other minors into giving her their money.\n\nShe was mad because she got caught, and you were right to tell the general manager what she tried doing to you.", "NTA - You clocked in and did the work, you get the pay. That's how it works when you cover a shift for someone. If your coworker didn't want to lose out on money, they could instead have traded shifts and work one of yours to make up for the one you covered. It's their tough luck and, if they got fired, that means they did something wrong not you.", "Why tf would you give them money for a shift YOU worked? That makes no sense\u2026and why tf would your mom agree? NTA.", "Is your mom on some fucking drugs wtf? No covering someone's shift does not work like that. You worked those hours that is your money", "NTA.  That\u2019s not how that works.  She asked you to cover her shift and you did so therefore it\u2019s YOUR money.  Otherwise you could just ask anyone to cover your shifts while you sat at home and kept all the money.  That coworker tried to take advantage of you and I don\u2019t know what to say about your mother.  Wtf?", "that escalated quickly, good for you kid.  she just hit the \"find out\" part of FAFO", "NTA and just fyi I'm guessing your former coworker has pulled this stunt before or had other performance issues. If asking you for the money was her only offense, she probably wouldn't have been fired immediately. \n\nI would consider telling your manager that she's harassing you via text, especially if it continues or if any of your other coworkers give you shit about it.", "Didn't you work for it though? If you were the one doing labour to earn the money, then it's totally yours to keep. He did ask you to cover his shift for him, but he never clarified who's money it is in the end. So yes, you earned it, you keep it.", "Lol no doesn\u2019t work that way she couldn\u2019t work you worked it your money", "NTA. Why would you give your coworker money for work you did? Also, what is your mother thinking?", "NTA\n\n> My (16m) coworker texted me and asked for the money that I got for working her shift.\n\nIf you did the work, it\u2019s your money. (It would likely violate labor laws if your employer didn\u2019t pay you)\n\n> The day after the shift she texted me and said \u201cI think they accidentally gave the money to you even though it was my shift, do you mind sending me it by venmo?\u201d I think she\u2019s just trying to gaslight me into giving her my money \n\nOh that\u2019s exactly what she was doing. She didn\u2019t work her scheduled shift - you did. \n\n> I asked my parents and my mom said give it to her \n\n\u2026your mom is definitely in the wrong here.\n\nFor the record, if there is actually a payroll error, it should be reported to your manager and they need to figure it out.\n\nThere should never be a circumstance where you are asked to pay a co-worker. (Although if you were paid in error, you would likely have to return the money.)\n\n> think she got fired. After I asked the general manager she texted me and cussed me out for telling him.\n\nShe tried to take advantage of a 16yo kid to take their money.\n\nIf she got fired it\u2019s her own fault. (And usually people who pull this kind of stunt have a pattern of poor behavior, so if she did get fired there are likely other reasons why.)\n\nETA:\n\nOh, and save the text messages as proof of harrassment/retaliation.", "This is not how any of this works. She knows you\u2019re young and naive, and she\u2019s taking advantage of you. Why in the world would she get paid for a shift you worked?

Keep your money.", "Nta, and she is!", "Hell no, that's not how jobs work!\n\nYOU worked the shift, YOU get the money. End of story. \n\nNTA", "NTA. This is so sad. She was taking advantage of you. If she didn\u2019t work it, she doesn\u2019t get the money.", "NTA. Maybe she thought she was supposed to use some banked paid time off or something, but it makes zero sense for her to get paid for your work. If there is confusion, she should talk to the boss/HR, not you. I can\u2019t think of any scenario where you would transfer wages for hours worked via personal means.", "NTA, and don\u2019t feel bad if your coworker got fired over this.  Covering someone\u2019s shift means you work the shift so they can get time off, there is absolutely no reason for her to get the money that you earned.  You worked the shift, the money is yours.  Your coworker was trying to take advantage of you, she deserved to get fired.  The fact that she told you to just keep the money after you said you would ask the manager shows it, she knew she was being shady.", "NTA you worked the hours so the money is yours to keep you took her shift she is not entitled to the money at all she didn\u2019t work the hours she asked you to do it she gave it up", "NTA. I'm glad this has been resolved per your updates, but please don't ever take financial advice from your mother.", "NTA\nYou should report you mom to the Department of Labor. \\s\n\nReally though\u2026 that was a good move to tell GM anyway. Who knows how many people she would do that to. What did she think? Working someone else\u2019s shift is charity? If she found enough people to work all her shifts she could just collect a paycheck while everyone does her job. \n\nYour mom is a buy out of touch with life though. She is probably a very nice mom but sheesh.", "NTA. What a scummy person, you did everything exactly right. What world does she live in lol", "You worked the shift. It is your money.", "My guess is that the mom is one of those \"don't rock the boat\" or \"keep the peace\" enablers.", "I was thinking the same then I realized the only reason she thinks this is bc maybe she never work before.\n\nNTA", "She is in her 20s apparently so she knew exactly what she was doing!", "This is a lesson for future reference; your mom is clearly not on your side. NTA", "You worked a shift it's your money. If you were the one off and your shift was covered by her, they would never volunteer to give you the money they earned. Plus the manager will enter your time working to the IRS, Social Security, etc., not her.", "Seriously this would make me lose a lot of faith/trust in my mom. She is either ignorant having never worked before or is kind of the AH too", "Mom\u2019s take is so bizarre that I have to wonder if there\u2019s anything she sides with OP on or if it\u2019s common to just tell him he\u2019s always wrong.

She\u2019s a manipulative con artist trying to pull one over on a new hire", "Exactly this. Never cover a shift for them again. You a required to be paid for any shift that you work.

I can't imagine being that much of a pushover.", "[removed]", "Is she brand new at having a job too?", "Never give someone money that they didn't work for. At the very least, it's tax fraud. You will be paying taxes on money you didn't keep. This goes for tipping people out who are not supposed to be tipped out. \n\nFor context, I was a server at a terribly managed restaurant where the  dish guy helped bussing to get a tip out under the table. He makes 15 an hour. I made 2.45. That day, I bussed all my tables and didn't get as many as I was put in the party section. That would be okay, but reservations were made, and no one canceled but just didn't show up, so I hadn't made much money. Coworkers didn't like me so end of day they told me in front of everyone that we were tipping out the dish guy 15 dollars each. I straight up told them I made 85 dollars, I'm not tipping out anyone, especially since he didn't bus a single one of my tables. \n\nIn reality, I'm not giving away money I have to pay taxes on. When it goes through the tipping system, it shows that I didn't make the money I gave away, but doing it under the table makes it look like I made more than I did, so I have to pay taxes on it and possibly be in a higher wage bracket than I actually am. (US wage brackets go up pretty quickly for people who make less than 6 figures). \n\nDO NOT GIVE AWAY YOUR MONEY.", "Yes. She may try to do this to someone else.", "If it escalates, then yes. You shouldn't be pestered for the money, nor should you be mistreated in any way by her as a result of this. If she accepts that she's not getting the money, then you might choose not to report it.", "She's not really doing anything illegal, so there's not really anything to report. \n\nAs other posters have covered,  when someone asks you to cover a shift, they usually just mean that they want the day off. It's supposed to be mutually beneficial. They get more time and you get more money. \n\nIt's impossible to tell if this lady is scamming you or just really doesn't understand how the world works. \n\nI'm a conflict avoider, so I'd make up some excuse like the taxes are too complicated that way, why don't you work one of my shifts to get the money back.", "Right, he obviously worked under his id, but what I'm fishing for is, was there a hint that she thought she'd be getting paid. \n\nLike \"can you cover my shift? Cool thanks\" is different than \"can you cover my shift? Cool, my clock id is 28314\"", "Her, the one trying to get op to pay them is a woman, he says she multiple times \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd26", ">It's pretty cute for him to try and convince you to pay him to do shit.\n\nIn case anyone else is wondering what this gibberish is supposed to mean, it appears to be a paraphrase of a sentence from this post:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1225un4/comment/jdp21q0/", "Uh she\u2019s in her 20s so I doubt it", "It's pretty easy to tell that this woman was trying to scam them, with the fact that once they mentioned bringing up to the manager they instantly changed their mind.", "That still doesn't make sense.  Just a wrong pronoun used.  Should say, *pretty cute for her*", "Sounds like she\u2019s just tryna scam you cuz you\u2019re young.
