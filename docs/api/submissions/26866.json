We are both African but from 2 different countries. He proposed 18 months ago. While wedding planning, we realised what a logistical nightmare it would be to have everyone we want there in one place. After much consideration, we decided to have a ceremony in all of places most important to us: my country, his country and the country we live in.   \nThe first stop was in my country, where we had first a marriage ceremony as my parent's homestead then a European style white wedding. It was large affair as my parents went all out on the wedding and invited lots of people.  \nNext was in my husband's country and it was oh so beautiful. His mum had a traditional bridal gown made for me and I felt so loved and welcomed by his family. It was another big celebration as his parents did the same thing as mine.   \nFinally we returned to Europe where we had a small ceremony with about 60 people. It was by far the most lowkey but still a nice ceremony. We self funded this one and our parents paid for the ones in their respective countries. We had a 2 week holiday before coming back to start new jobs. It all lasted 8 weeks from start to finish. The only consistent guests were our immediate nuclear families as we didn't want to put anyone out.  \nWe made 1 instagram post captioned 'What's better than 1 wedding?' (a music reference) with 10 pictures from across our ceremonies and 1 from our honeymoon.   \nI had a catch up with my friend on return and found she'd gotten engaged while we were back home. I congratulated her and was happy for her, asking if she had started planning the wedding. She said yes, but money was tight and she's had to do it on a budget. She asked for my support given the summer I'd just had and asked me to be in her bridal party. I said of course, and I'd help her plan a great wedding that won't break the bank.  \nI've been sending her messages of pinterests and tiktoks I see of budget friendly ideas for her wedding. She's been blue ticking me for a while, so I asked if everything was okay. I got a massively long paragraph telling me I'm a bad person.   \nI had 4 weddings where she can barely afford one. I'm sending her tacky DIY things when I had a classy ceremony. I did not offer to help her pay for her wedding when I can clearly afford 4 weddings and a honeymoon. I'm a bad friend for even letting her get to this point. I am spoilt and privileged and so ungrateful. I left her on read for a day because if I'd responded straight away I'd have cursed her of her name. She sends me aggressive ?????? texts, asking if I have nothing to say which is comical given she'd been leaving me on read for ages. I replied and said you're clearly dealing with something right now. I'm going to give you space to face your demons. Come back to me when you're ready to be an adult and have a rational conversation. \n\nShe said I was condescending and unfeeling. I blocked her to maintain my peace. \n\nAITA?  \n", "created_utc": 1694697387, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ii8cm/aita_for_having_4_weddings/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your friend is projecting all of her insecurities onto you. Not cool.", "Focusing specifically on the issue with that other person, she hoped you would bankroll a fifth wedding.

My wife and I got married young and had the traditional American wedding that was largely dictated by family expectations. Since then we've gone through a lot of the things that often break couples apart (major health issues/disabilities, financial struggles, job loss, living with/supporting a sick relative, a pandemic, and my wife transitioning). So now we wanted to do a vow renewal for our milestone anniversary to celebrate that our marriage survived through all of that (plus my wife never got to be a bride and gay marriage wasn't even legal when we got married in the first place) but we realized that we kinda had two directions we wanted to go (one more subdued party with family and one more exuberant party with friends) so we decided 'why not both'? We're not expecting gifts, we're not expecting anyone to travel for both, we're not asking anyone for financial support, we're doing it because we can and because we want to. \n\nJust because you had 4 weddings (in massively different locations and cultural contexts) does not obligate you to finance your friend's wedding, nor does it make you an asshole."]}
