I suggest you try to speak to her, maybe also suggest therapy(which you could pay as she probably wouldnt go otherwise). \n\nI feel it is normal to be jelous having grown the way she did and seeing how differemt it is for her sister, but she should also understand that she always got the best you could offer(now she is also getting spoiled) and so is her sister.", "Going with NTA. Most people grow and change as they get older and have more life experiences. Not all siblings grow up under the same economic conditions. Is it fair? Nope but Sam thinking because her childhood was harder than her sister's that Kathy should have a tough childhood as well is ridiculous. I understand her feelings of jealousy and unfairness but to think Kathy should live the same childhood circumstances when it's not necessary is unreasonable and unrealistic. Talk to your oldest. You are doing your best right now to help them get ahead in life by covering college education and expenses. You can't change the past.", "YTA\n\nShe clearly has trauma from growing up that way and living the struggle, though she is getting some help from you now to her it looks like her sister got the childhood she dreamed of.

It's the way of life that children are raised differently when there are age gaps. OP mentions in the comments that they were making progress financially and career-wise just before the recession, so the recession completely set back any progress they'd made and then some. By the time OP was able to enact the changes that would lead to an improved life for the whole family, the benefit would be felt most by the youngest. It is what it is. Getting financially stable takes time. \n\nAs the youngest in my family, I got a different childhood than the oldest in my family. My parents were older and more laid back with me, but due to the recession, I got no assistance with college. My sibling, on the other hand, had significant help with college and was able to start working in their career field just before the recession struck. While the financial ramifications have dramatically affected my ability to build wealth by comparison, I would not EVER wish my older sibling had had less help, so it would be more \"equal.\" It would be incredibly toxic if I wished ill on somebody I love. As for my parents, they did the best they could with the knowledge they had at the time. \n\n The daughter seems really entitled and is letting it embitter her. Most people can't afford to fund their children's college and pay for their rent (that's great that she had access to that privilege, especially after growing up in a low-income house).  The daughter is allowed to have her feelings and be upset, but the second she wished suffering onto her sibling, she crossed a line. \n\nDo I think she deserved to be completely cut-off? I would have likely tried something less drastic if I were OP.  (Ie. requiring the daughter go to therapy if she wanted housing/phone assistance, etc.) \n\nOverall, I think ESH. The daughter is bitter and acting toxic. OP should have responded in some fashion, but I think they went a bit overboard without ever addressing the underlying issues.", "NTA.\n\nUnless she gets some therapy to deal wit her jealousy and learn to accept that sometimes life is really freaking unfair, this won't resolve itself. Her feelings of unfairness are valid. Her demands that her sister suffer because she did are not. \n\nOlder daughter needs to understand that you didn't WANT things to suck for her and that you regret that they did. She needs to accept that you can't change the past. So, she's TA for not being able to see that and be grateful that things are better, and not being reasonable about you doing the best you could with what resources you had available to you. \n\nYou also can't beat yourself up about how things have turned out. Don't be guilted into doing all kinds of expensive things to \"make up for\" her earlier years.  You've been paying for college and vacations and providing the opportunities that you can for her now that you are in a position to do so. That's sufficient. As an adult, at some point she has to take those responsibilities on for herself. Don't let her guilt you into doing this for the rest of her life or she'll never really grow up.", "YTA. You need family therapy and to sit down with your daughters and partner) you said we realized things need to change so I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s another parent in the picture. \n\nWhen you realized things needed to change, you were around less for Sam during years where Sam can remember this but Kathy can\u2019t. Sam: grew up poor, parent gone at work and classes all the time until she was an adult. Kathy had a at least a middle class life with 2 adults around for 2/3 of her childhood. \n\nIt\u2019s a no brainer why Sam is jealous and resentful. She wasn\u2019t important enough for you to change her circumstances but her younger sister was? She\u2019s spent over a decade living with that resentment, having to work harder, and seeing her sister get opportunities she never had. \n\nWhen she was 14, she was probably worried about how she would even be able to go to college. Her sister never had to go through that. \n\nThere\u2019s a difference between equality and equity. Equality would be giving them both the same resources, which at this point, you didn\u2019t do and can\u2019t fix. \n\nEquity would be making this up to Sam by doing more for her as an adult. For example: if she wants to go to grad school, contributing more to that as she was at an educational disadvantage. When buying a home, contribute more to the down payment. Maybe offer to help Sam upgrade her current wardrobe or contribute to a trip she\u2019d like to take with her friends. Things that help her feel like she\u2019s being taken care of in the way she never was as a child. But threatening to stop paying her rent is cruel. \n\nYou will need to have a conversation with Kathy about why this is happening, so she understands that you\u2019re helping Sam in a way you weren\u2019t capable of doing when Sam was younger and that Kathy is fortunate to have these opportunities her sister did not.", "YTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t bother trying to better your life until you gave birth to Kathy.

Do better", "I don\u2019t think OP and everyone voting NTA realize that Kathy has been set up for success while Sam was set up for failure.

They failed Sam, and now they\u2019re punishing her for being angry about it. Of course Sam snapped. \n\nSam has every right to be upset her parents were fine with her situation until Kathy came along.", "It took until Kathy was born for OP to decide to do better.", "I imagine OP wanted to change things even before that, but it\u2019s quite hard when you have debt, etc. Sam didn\u2019t have a great childhood and  it\u2019s fine to be jealous, but to wish her sister has it the same way is cruel. Sam is still incredibly lucky to have a mom that provides for her now, with college, vacation etc.", "YTA this 100 percent.

Our older daughter Sam is  mad we now make more money (put in same story blah blah blah) and Kathy has an iPhone, has better clothes and goes to a better school.  We pay for Sam\u2019s tuition and apartment because we can afford it.  Sam yelled at her sister and we agreed with Sam so we have moved Kathy into the same shitty inner city school Sam went to, took her iPhone away and refuse to buy any more clothes until she absolutely needs them.  We are only going to allow her to buy from thrift stores.   Sam still has her college and apartment paid for.  \n\nThis sub would lose their mind if that was the post.", "My impression is the parents are clueless about what they've done to her. Maybe they don't care. You're right about them needing to do everything they can to make up for it.", "Sam is basically Tibby from the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. The practice child to make all their mistakes on.", "What an infantile assessment of their situation. Life is complicated and there\u2019s a lot of nuance in parenting and parents grow with their children. The mom was 21 and most likely immature when Sam was born, we don\u2019t know why her living situation was the way that it was but 8 years later she has another kid and she\u2019s now 29. She\u2019s more mature and now has another mouth to feed and recognizes she can\u2019t sustain her growing family anymore and decides to work hard for a change. This person that\u2019s like \u201cYeah you little shit, we\u2019re all gonna be poor until another little girl comes along that I\u2019ll actually love\u201d doesn\u2019t exist outside of movies. Had they not had Kathy, there likely would eventually been another catalyst for change later.", "How is it being ignored? That\u2019s literally the entire question. We all know they pay rent and college. The question is if they\u2019re an asshole for paying anymore because Sam *rightfully* got angry and lashed out for the extreme difference in opportunities afforded to each kid. Paying rent is the parents making up for dropping the ball so severely, and it\u2019s shitty for them to stop because their daughter finally showed how she feels about their failures. They can afford to give her the opportunities that her little sister has now. Them taking that away is taking away the only thing they ever helped Sam with. \n\nThe lightbulb went off too late and Sam had to pay the consequences. OP knew the situation before the recession even hit, so the recession argument is nonsense. They were poor the whole time, and OP *knew that.* the fact that it took that for them to do something is the biggest reason they\u2019re an asshole. Recession or no recession, the parents knew they were struggling and we\u2019re fine with it until EIGHT YEARS into their child\u2019s life. \n\nHaving college and rent paid for isn\u2019t being ignored. I\u2019m not missing your point, you are missing mine. Paying rent after choosing for their child to live in poverty her entire life is the least the parents could do. It took them EIGHT YEARS to even consider doing something about their situation, and then took them TEN YEARS to succeed in changing it. No excuse for that.", "Yea I don\u2019t think OP is seeing this from Sam\u2019s perspective at all. Kathy has been given every opportunity and tool for a successful and well rounded future, Sam got scraps.", "You don\u2019t even realize how insane this comment is and that makes me feel sad for you.\n\nYou\u2019re incredibly naive if you think that attitude only exists in movies. And being 21 is not an excuse to not try to do better for your child. \n\nThe judgment here is about them halting paying rent. They\u2019re more mature and financially stable now, they should be giving their oldest opportunities that they failed to give her as a child. Opportunities her sister has had for years.\n\nEdited because I mistakenly said \u201cpaying for college.\u201d", "Calling their completely correct assessment \u201cinfantile\u201d doesn\u2019t make it any less right or make your terrible assessment any less wrong.", "What I was missing from your posts is your need to project your shitty experiences and claim all parents are evil because things aren\u2019t perfect all the time.  Dude get some therapy.", "Agreed.", "Your comments are absolutely dripping with mommy/ daddy issues", "Found the other \u201cmommy issues\u201d", "Yes I do have mommy issues. Which is why I understand how awful this feels for Sam. That\u2019s called having empathy because of being in a similar situation.\n\nIdk why you think that\u2019s a strike against me."]}
