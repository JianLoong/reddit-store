I suggest you try to speak to her, maybe also suggest therapy(which you could pay as she probably wouldnt go otherwise). \n\nI feel it is normal to be jelous having grown the way she did and seeing how differemt it is for her sister, but she should also understand that she always got the best you could offer(now she is also getting spoiled) and so is her sister.", "Going with NTA. Most people grow and change as they get older and have more life experiences. Not all siblings grow up under the same economic conditions. Is it fair? Nope but Sam thinking because her childhood was harder than her sister's that Kathy should have a tough childhood as well is ridiculous. I understand her feelings of jealousy and unfairness but to think Kathy should live the same childhood circumstances when it's not necessary is unreasonable and unrealistic. Talk to your oldest. You are doing your best right now to help them get ahead in life by covering college education and expenses. You can't change the past.", "YTA\n\nShe clearly has trauma from growing up that way and living the struggle, though she is getting some help from you now to her it looks like her sister got the childhood she dreamed of.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "[removed]", "I'm wondering at the age of some of the people who are so aggressively criticizing OP for not providing better for the oldest child. It's the way of life that children are raised differently when there are age gaps. OP mentions in the comments that they were making progress financially and career-wise just before the recession, so the recession completely set back any progress they'd made and then some. By the time OP was able to enact the changes that would lead to an improved life for the whole family, the benefit would be felt most by the youngest. It is what it is. Getting financially stable takes time. \n\nAs the youngest in my family, I got a different childhood than the oldest in my family. My parents were older and more laid back with me, but due to the recession, I got no assistance with college. My sibling, on the other hand, had significant help with college and was able to start working in their career field just before the recession struck. While the financial ramifications have dramatically affected my ability to build wealth by comparison, I would not EVER wish my older sibling had had less help, so it would be more \"equal.\" It would be incredibly toxic if I wished ill on somebody I love. As for my parents, they did the best they could with the knowledge they had at the time. \n\n The daughter seems really entitled and is letting it embitter her. Most people can't afford to fund their children's college and pay for their rent (that's great that she had access to that privilege, especially after growing up in a low-income house).  The daughter is allowed to have her feelings and be upset, but the second she wished suffering onto her sibling, she crossed a line. \n\nDo I think she deserved to be completely cut-off? I would have likely tried something less drastic if I were OP.  (Ie. requiring the daughter go to therapy if she wanted housing/phone assistance, etc.) \n\nOverall, I think ESH. The daughter is bitter and acting toxic. OP should have responded in some fashion, but I think they went a bit overboard without ever addressing the underlying issues.", "NTA.\n\nUnless she gets some therapy to deal wit her jealousy and learn to accept that sometimes life is really freaking unfair, this won't resolve itself. Her feelings of unfairness are valid. Her demands that her sister suffer because she did are not. \n\nOlder daughter needs to understand that you didn't WANT things to suck for her and that you regret that they did. She needs to accept that you can't change the past. So, she's TA for not being able to see that and be grateful that things are better, and not being reasonable about you doing the best you could with what resources you had available to you. \n\nYou also can't beat yourself up about how things have turned out. Don't be guilted into doing all kinds of expensive things to \"make up for\" her earlier years.  You've been paying for college and vacations and providing the opportunities that you can for her now that you are in a position to do so. That's sufficient. As an adult, at some point she has to take those responsibilities on for herself. Don't let her guilt you into doing this for the rest of her life or she'll never really grow up.", "YTA. You need family therapy and to sit down with your daughters and partner) you said we realized things need to change so I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s another parent in the picture. \n\nWhen you realized things needed to change, you were around less for Sam during years where Sam can remember this but Kathy can\u2019t. Sam: grew up poor, parent gone at work and classes all the time until she was an adult. Kathy had a at least a middle class life with 2 adults around for 2/3 of her childhood. \n\nIt\u2019s a no brainer why Sam is jealous and resentful. She wasn\u2019t important enough for you to change her circumstances but her younger sister was? She\u2019s spent over a decade living with that resentment, having to work harder, and seeing her sister get opportunities she never had. \n\nWhen she was 14, she was probably worried about how she would even be able to go to college. Her sister never had to go through that. \n\nThere\u2019s a difference between equality and equity. Equality would be giving them both the same resources, which at this point, you didn\u2019t do and can\u2019t fix. \n\nEquity would be making this up to Sam by doing more for her as an adult. For example: if she wants to go to grad school, contributing more to that as she was at an educational disadvantage. When buying a home, contribute more to the down payment. Maybe offer to help Sam upgrade her current wardrobe or contribute to a trip she\u2019d like to take with her friends. Things that help her feel like she\u2019s being taken care of in the way she never was as a child. But threatening to stop paying her rent is cruel. \n\nYou will need to have a conversation with Kathy about why this is happening, so she understands that you\u2019re helping Sam in a way you weren\u2019t capable of doing when Sam was younger and that Kathy is fortunate to have these opportunities her sister did not.", "YTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t bother trying to better your life until you gave birth to Kathy.

Sam is still incredibly lucky to have a mom that provides for her now, with college, vacation etc.", "YTA this 100 percent.

OP basically admits it in a comment. They were poor when the first daughter was born.

And I can\u2019t help feeling sad when my sister brags about all of her expensive game consoles and toys that she just leaves on the ground.

Change happens when the pain of change is less than the pain of staying the same. I'm sorry that Sam is struggling with envy, it's understandable that she is, but unfortunately you cannot go back in time and fix her childhood. And you are still providing her financial support now, rent and tuition still puts her massively ahead of most of her peers, regardless of the rest of her childhood. Cutting her off will only reinforce her belief in the inequality between her and her sister, so I would reinstate those payments.\n\nThere's a difference between being unable to provide something and refusing to provide it. You did not refuse to provide your oldest a wealthier childhood, you were unable to. Posters are essentially positing that you refused to, which is a massive error. OP doesn't love her second daughter more simply because that pregnancy was the catalyst for her realizing she needed to make a change, and that she's able to provide Kathy a more financially stable life now. Again, there's a difference between unwilling and unable.\n\nI think you all need family therapy though, big time. There is clearly serious hurt on Sam's part.

(The more common reaction). Sam is the latter and it's not her fault.  \n\nYou need to foster the relationship between the sisters. Your younger daughter needs to understand the struggles that Sam had and Sam needs to understand that adding struggle to her sister's life when not necessary is not going to fix her own childhood. \n\nI'm saying yta because of the threat to no longer support her.

Remember Kathy also went through 10 years of poverty too so she didn\u2019t receive special treatment at all from their mom. They both now receive full support from their mom as she is able to give it. Poverty sucks ass but to sit there and blame the mother as if she\u2019s treating her kids differently is wrong.

Would you not be upset? Would you not find it unfair? Or would you just go \"well not everyone gets a car at all so oh well\"?

It's the timing of it all. It took 8 years of poverty and Kathy's birth for OP to realise they need to do something. It may not be the case but I wouldn't be surprised if Sam feels that OP gained the realisation due to Kathy's birth. It would probably feel like Sam's 8 years of suffering wasn't enough for OP and her husband to start trying but the thought of Kathy also suffering like Sam that caused it.\n\nAll OP has to do is try and give Sam something above and beyond.

That my oldest had poor quality stuff, couldn't eat well, couldn't go out much, couldn't spend time with me much, couldn't go to a good school and then has to watch as I give all of that to their younger sibling. \n\nI'd be feeling so guilty and try to make it up somehow. I wouldn't make the 2nd kid go through the same suffering but I'd at least try and give the oldest more support than what I'd give if they hadn't suffered as a kid.\n\nIdeas I've seen are stuff like giving Sam more money for when she buys a house, gets married or goes to grad school.

Once she reached high school, the bus was no longer an option and I was driving her through high school traffic on the days my parents couldn't do it.

Our middle was just young enough (beginning of high school) to start seeing the benefits of our increased income. 21 didn\u2019t see it until the end of high school. We\u2019ve had many conversations with our two oldest, and have explained that everyone\u2019s situation is different, but we do what we can to benefit each as much as we can. While it was a mixed bag, we involved our kids in our struggles, at times more than we should have. Our oldest two appreciate and recognize the growth.

So my life was uprooted in the middle of my 9th grade year and we moved states. Once I graduated highschool my parents gifted me a laptop one of his friends had rebuilt/refurbished. The thing was a brick and looked ancient. Was I a little sad and disappointed...of course but I knew that was what my parents could afford plus this way I wouldn't have to do all my future homework in the library!\n\n  I always knew that I would be using loans to get through college. My parents loved me and wished they could help but they just didn't have much money.

The rest I paid with loans, a scholarship, and a job. \n\nFast forward to when my younger sisters graduated, 4 years apart from each other. By this time my dad had finished his bachelor's degree and gotten a master's degree through WGU. So each of my sisters got a brand new laptop. \n\nI was so jealous and mad that they got nice computers while I got a brick.

So I wasn't jealous that they had something I couldn't but that they got the childhood I couldn't have. \n\nNow I've mostly worked through the jealousy.  I worked through it looking at what I gained by growing up poor. I have a stronger work ethic than my sisters especially the youngest!

Not to put Kathy down, but to raise Sam up; to tell her that she's good enough to deserve all the things that Kathy gets now, but you just couldn't provide them for her at the time. \n\nIf you have to scale back on giving Kathy everything her heart desires to make this happen, do it.

So it only seems fair to give more to Sam to even it up.\n\n>It probably didn\u2019t just take Kathy\u2019s birth but the realization that they couldn\u2019t support two kids on the bare minimum.\n\nThey couldn't even properly support one kid considering there was food insecurity. It took 8 years of it and another kid to realise this apparently. You can't see how this would look to the kid that suffered as a result of OP not having a eureka moment until it was too late?\n\n>So it\u2019s ok because she didn\u2019t \u201csuffer\u201d for a full 18 years? \n\nSuffering 10 years isn't as bad as suffering 18. \n\n>I would\u2019ve been fucking over the moon and there\u2019s no way I\u2019d be like \u201cwell you can now give your grandkids better, so you suck.\u201d\n\nWhat makes you think Sam isn't happy for her mother for getting out of poverty? You can have problems with something while still having an overall good view of it. You can't compare your thing with grandchildren with your siblings. You see it on this sub everyday. Loads of people talking about golden children and scapegoats. Those are all siblings. Not people and their children complaining about how their parents treat their kids differently to how they were treated as kids. \n\n>If OP wants an all expenses paid trip then verbalize what the fuck would help, don\u2019t immaturely suggest fucking over a literal kid. \n\nOh please it's not like OP couldn't have verbalised shit either. Instead of apologising and saying \"Look, I can't deprive from Kathy because it's not fair to her. But I know the circumstances weren't fair to you either. Would you feel better if I did this and that to make it up to you instead? I can't go back in time and change things, but I want you to know I love you and support you both equally and this is my way of showing that.\" She tells Sam to not be jealous because she grew up in poverty and pulled support from Sam as an adult as well. \n\nClearly the aunts were cool headed enough to understand what the problem was. Sometimes people get so caught up in their emotions that they're not able to say what they really want. But it's obvious to everyone else that what she was really asking for was some support now to make up for what she missed out on rather than an actual deprivation of her sister.\n\n>There\u2019s literally nothing you\u2019re saying that\u2019s making any semblance of sense, no matter how you spin it.\n\nThen stop spinning things and just read. You looked at an example used to illustrate my point and your first thought was really \"I wouldn\u2019t care about the car because I\u2019m not a materialistic asshole\"? The cars were irrelevant and you could use something else to make the same point. There's no way you could think that was a proper response to an example.", "Thank you so much for this wise perspective. \ud83d\ude0aPeople who\u2019ve never been through something wouldn\u2019t understand how difficult it is to get yourself out of a bad situation.", "yeah, I\u2019m seeing that.", "My brother and I were 10 years apart. I had teen parents who just wanted to party and not worry about rent. My childhood sucked. My brother 10 years younger? The kid has everything he could ever want, has been on so many vacations.

Like...does anyone remember what it was like when they were 21 years old? My god. I was a mess. A complete wreck. I could hardly take care of myself - I was poor, from a poor family, and I made stupid decisions. I can't imagine having a child as well.\n\nI don't know if OP's response was right. But we don't know how long they discussed this. All we know is that her adult daughter threw a jealous fit over her 14-year old little sister.\n\nI totally understand the jealousy, and I'm not saying that she was wrong for feeling it. But shouting at her baby sister that she should be going to a shit school and wearing hand-me-downs (both of which I did) is ridiculous, immature, and frankly really mean. She seems to be doing well now, and she should be thankful that her mother worked so hard to be able to help her enjoy her young adult years without struggle.\n\nETA: It actually really aggravates me that so many people here seem to think that OP CHOSE to suddenly make an effort when her second daughter was born. My god. We have no idea what OP's life experience was. To me, she seems to be a hardworking woman who went through some hard times and figured it out in the end. She worked hard, going to school at night to get her degree and then to find a good, high paying job - how difficult is that? It's not easy. It's fucking not easy. Life is hard. And now both of OP's daughter don't have to suffer like their mother did to survive on their own.\n\nOP: NTA", "Seriously. Am I taking crazy pills reading these replies. It\u2019s fine to feel jealous that you didn\u2019t get the same opportunities.

Were I OP I would - within what I could afford - do what I could do to \"even the balance sheet\" a bit more than she's doing, because of course Kathy will get college paid, and she should. \n\nBut maybe OP should treat Sam to an all-expenses-paid trip to France or Italy (not a family trip with Kathy - this would be a trip for Sam and OP to take, assuming someone was available to care for Kathy). Maybe OP should write a check for Sam to refurbish her wardrobe, have some special unnecessary \"extras\" that her younger sister DOESN'T get, simply to impress upon Sam that Kathy ISN'T the golden child now that OP has money. It's what I would do, to address the understandable resentment and preserve the family relationships going forward. This may be one of those problems that can be fixed by throwing money at it in a thoughtful way. If it is, then OP should do just that.", "You are not taking crazy pills.

My siblings and I joke about it but no one is mad.  We are very very close and like to joke with each other.  Life's not equal.  My mom got a job at a private school when I was in 2nd grade.  My highschool aged siblings always went to public school and I mostly went private.  My sister had far more help with her kids than I get because my parents now have health issues.  I'm taking care of them and my young children where she got free childcare.  I don't hold that against my parents or my sister.  My dad has brain cancer.  It's very aggressive and he most likely doesn't have much time left.  My parents had more money by the time they had me, but my siblings got 8 and 9 years longer with him.  I'd trade places with them in a heartbeat, but I in no way resent them or my parents for any of the differences.  That's just life.

When she got a high paying job and no longer went to school I was 16 and my sister was 8. \n\nIt\u2019s a very hard pill to swallow watching your sibling have the childhood you wished you had. It\u2019s more than just material things too; I never saw my mom cause she was ALWAYS either working or at school, or taking care of my sister. I was the kid she didn\u2019t have time for and that did a number on my self worth. Please try to see this from your eldest point of view this is coming from YEARS of hurt.", "Yeah, YTA here. Sam isn\u2019t expressing herself particularly well, but punishing her for being jealous is an AH move. It\u2019s normal that she would recognize and even internalize the disparities in their upbringings, even if you didn\u2019t consciously create them. How or when you decided to change your circumstances to make your life better is irrelevant. You would be wise to point out to her that you realize there are major differences, and that what you do for her *now* is your way of making up for what you couldn\u2019t provide for her then. A benefit that may not be available, or even needed, for Kathy. \n\nYou should be talking this out and giving her time and space to see it, but you\u2019re withholding help from her because she didn\u2019t get to that realization right away.

It isn\u2019t very fair to judged so harshly for literally doing better for yourself, this comment thread is wild. Yta for saying you won\u2019t pay. Pay for therapy and separate your daughters. Neither deserve that treatment. But you can\u2019t be the asshole for your life happening in the way it did. You did better, you chose better, and you deserved better so you got it.

Separately and possibly together once the jealousy calms down.", "Yes YTA if you stop paying her rent: of course she\u2019s jealous, sad, hurt, and feels betrayed. I agree w the folks that recommended family therapy. Poverty is f\u2019ing hard as a child, and it makes perfect sense that Sam feels resentful.

The fact that you are still supporting your over 18 child by paying for college and their rent shows you are more then willing to still try your best to give them a better life. \nShe doesn\u2019t see that and exploded on your youngest, now it\u2019s her turn to struggle and try to earn and grow like you did in the past.", "YTA\n\nYour response to an argument with your daughter about unfair treatment is to cut her off. Learning you can't rely on your parents is a harsh lesson, and one that she'll never forget.\n\nAnd, gee, I wonder why she thinks you like her younger sister more, whom she probably had to help raise on top of that.", "YTA. *Although I do not agree with the top comments*: They sound as if you were intentionally not advancing professionally or doing well financially (or took 6 years to complete advance education - while working and raising a family) BECAUSE you didn't care about your eldest. Poppycock.\n\nIt's pretty normal for most families to start out poorer and improve their financial situation over time. You just realized you had to invest in some big changes to change your family's financial situation. You worked hard and did it - just rather late in the day for your eldest. Still, lots of kids do not get full support - NO DEBT - for the college education, the way you are helping Sam now, much less the vacations. Sam is also benefitting from your efforts a great deal and in a very meaningful way!\n\nThe part where you become TA is now using the threat of withholding your current wealth from your eldest because she is struggling with the immense difference in her childhood lifestyle compared to her sister's. Sam's jealousy in not healthy; nor are rants right. Three responses that you don't want to have:\n\n1. actually try to take things away from Kathy to make Sam feel better (not doing that - good)\n2. just ignoring Sam's rantings and rage (not doing that - good)\n3. exacerbating Sam's feelings of being given so much less than Kathy - by actually threatening to make Sam less well off. (Ahole badge earned).\n\nInstead, you may (1) offer to pay for Sam to have some counseling (maybe parent/Sam family counseling) to help her process her feelings. (with the possibility of rebuilding the sister relationship after Sam gets to a place where she's not going to rip Kathy to shreds with her anger) and\n\n(2) being clear with Sam that she must be civil toward and about Kathy and you parents. You may need to talk through with a counselor what sort of consequences would be appropriate if Sam refuses to be civil regarding Kathy. I just know - holding her college education over Sam's head is NOT appropriate.", "YTA\u2026 but for a slightly different reason than I think most other people have said. I think you did a bad job of raising your eldest daughter. I was the eldest child that grew up with scraps in my family. My younger sister never saw a glimpse of our poverty because she was born nearly a decade later and since then she has had everything she\u2019s ever wanted. But I NEVER was jealous of her for having more than me. In fact, I was happy that my sister didn\u2019t have to suffer the way I did and that she could use me as an example instead. And I think the reason I didn\u2019t have the same jealous reaction your eldest did is because my parents raised me to be grateful and humble for everything I have. I think you failed in teaching your eldest daughter this in some fundamental way, which is where a lot of her jealousy is stemming from. She is failing to see her sister as someone she should love and support because she\u2019s putting her struggles ahead of it, and I think it\u2019s because you\u2019ve either been invalidating her or you haven\u2019t provided adequate support or guidance now that you have money. I advise you to rethink the way you have been approaching both your daughters opinions about your wealth, and maybe try a different way of helping them see eye to eye. Family therapy would be a good place to start as others have suggested. I do agree with the other YTA reasons that have been commented, I just think there may be more nuance to it than just you ignoring her jealousy", "NTA and please do not take the Y T A responses too much to heart.  Raising a child at 21 vs 29 is going to be different and adding children adds to costs.  You've done what you could for both and are providing more to your oldest than what many parents are able to.  It's unfortunate that Sam grew up with less but she is no different from anyone else who has a huge age gaps between siblings.  It just is what it is and nothing can be done to \"fix\" it.  It isn't Kathy's fault and she shouldn't be punished for it or set up for failure because of it. Perhaps Sam needs therapy to work out these feelings of jealousy and at least recognize that directing towards her family isn't the healthiest way to go.  Maybe threatening her rent wasn't the way to go, since it was obviously only going to give a negative reaction.

Not sure whether this is ignorant or just misguided. There is a robust body of research about the importance of parental attention on babies in stimulating cognitive development and learning. What happens in the first few years of a child's life is critical to outcomes later in life. So while Kathy might not remember whether mom was around as much when she was very young, it's wrong to suggest that there was no trade-off or negative effect on Kathy.
