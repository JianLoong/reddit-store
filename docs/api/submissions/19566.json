I suggest you try to speak to her, maybe also suggest therapy(which you could pay as she probably wouldnt go otherwise). \n\nI feel it is normal to be jelous having grown the way she did and seeing how differemt it is for her sister, but she should also understand that she always got the best you could offer(now she is also getting spoiled) and so is her sister.", "Going with NTA. Most people grow and change as they get older and have more life experiences. Not all siblings grow up under the same economic conditions. Is it fair? Nope but Sam thinking because her childhood was harder than her sister's that Kathy should have a tough childhood as well is ridiculous. I understand her feelings of jealousy and unfairness but to think Kathy should live the same childhood circumstances when it's not necessary is unreasonable and unrealistic. Talk to your oldest. You are doing your best right now to help them get ahead in life by covering college education and expenses. You can't change the past.", "YTA\n\nShe clearly has trauma from growing up that way and living the struggle, though she is getting some help from you now to her it looks like her sister got the childhood she dreamed of.

It's the way of life that children are raised differently when there are age gaps. OP mentions in the comments that they were making progress financially and career-wise just before the recession, so the recession completely set back any progress they'd made and then some. By the time OP was able to enact the changes that would lead to an improved life for the whole family, the benefit would be felt most by the youngest. It is what it is. Getting financially stable takes time. \n\nAs the youngest in my family, I got a different childhood than the oldest in my family. My parents were older and more laid back with me, but due to the recession, I got no assistance with college. My sibling, on the other hand, had significant help with college and was able to start working in their career field just before the recession struck. While the financial ramifications have dramatically affected my ability to build wealth by comparison, I would not EVER wish my older sibling had had less help, so it would be more \"equal.\" It would be incredibly toxic if I wished ill on somebody I love. As for my parents, they did the best they could with the knowledge they had at the time. \n\n The daughter seems really entitled and is letting it embitter her. Most people can't afford to fund their children's college and pay for their rent (that's great that she had access to that privilege, especially after growing up in a low-income house).  The daughter is allowed to have her feelings and be upset, but the second she wished suffering onto her sibling, she crossed a line. \n\nDo I think she deserved to be completely cut-off? I would have likely tried something less drastic if I were OP.  (Ie. requiring the daughter go to therapy if she wanted housing/phone assistance, etc.) \n\nOverall, I think ESH. The daughter is bitter and acting toxic. OP should have responded in some fashion, but I think they went a bit overboard without ever addressing the underlying issues.", "NTA.\n\nUnless she gets some therapy to deal wit her jealousy and learn to accept that sometimes life is really freaking unfair, this won't resolve itself. Her feelings of unfairness are valid. Her demands that her sister suffer because she did are not. \n\nOlder daughter needs to understand that you didn't WANT things to suck for her and that you regret that they did. She needs to accept that you can't change the past. So, she's TA for not being able to see that and be grateful that things are better, and not being reasonable about you doing the best you could with what resources you had available to you. \n\nYou also can't beat yourself up about how things have turned out. Don't be guilted into doing all kinds of expensive things to \"make up for\" her earlier years.  You've been paying for college and vacations and providing the opportunities that you can for her now that you are in a position to do so. That's sufficient. As an adult, at some point she has to take those responsibilities on for herself. Don't let her guilt you into doing this for the rest of her life or she'll never really grow up.", "YTA. You need family therapy and to sit down with your daughters and partner) you said we realized things need to change so I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s another parent in the picture. \n\nWhen you realized things needed to change, you were around less for Sam during years where Sam can remember this but Kathy can\u2019t. Sam: grew up poor, parent gone at work and classes all the time until she was an adult. Kathy had a at least a middle class life with 2 adults around for 2/3 of her childhood. \n\nIt\u2019s a no brainer why Sam is jealous and resentful. She wasn\u2019t important enough for you to change her circumstances but her younger sister was? She\u2019s spent over a decade living with that resentment, having to work harder, and seeing her sister get opportunities she never had. \n\nWhen she was 14, she was probably worried about how she would even be able to go to college. Her sister never had to go through that. \n\nThere\u2019s a difference between equality and equity. Equality would be giving them both the same resources, which at this point, you didn\u2019t do and can\u2019t fix. \n\nEquity would be making this up to Sam by doing more for her as an adult. For example: if she wants to go to grad school, contributing more to that as she was at an educational disadvantage. When buying a home, contribute more to the down payment. Maybe offer to help Sam upgrade her current wardrobe or contribute to a trip she\u2019d like to take with her friends. Things that help her feel like she\u2019s being taken care of in the way she never was as a child. But threatening to stop paying her rent is cruel. \n\nYou will need to have a conversation with Kathy about why this is happening, so she understands that you\u2019re helping Sam in a way you weren\u2019t capable of doing when Sam was younger and that Kathy is fortunate to have these opportunities her sister did not.", "YTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t bother trying to better your life until you gave birth to Kathy.

Do better", "I don\u2019t think OP and everyone voting NTA realize that Kathy has been set up for success while Sam was set up for failure.

They failed Sam, and now they\u2019re punishing her for being angry about it. Of course Sam snapped. \n\nSam has every right to be upset her parents were fine with her situation until Kathy came along.", "It took until Kathy was born for OP to decide to do better.", "I imagine OP wanted to change things even before that, but it\u2019s quite hard when you have debt, etc. Sam didn\u2019t have a great childhood and  it\u2019s fine to be jealous, but to wish her sister has it the same way is cruel. Sam is still incredibly lucky to have a mom that provides for her now, with college, vacation etc.", "YTA this 100 percent.

Personally, I think your main argument is steeped in eugenics ideology (poor people shouldn't have kids always falls down the rabbit hole of \"other undesirable people shouldn't have children.\" I don't care if you think I'm \"reaching,\" \"hysterical,\" or if you \"didn't mean it like that.\" Saying people shouldn't have children because of social class is gross and puts the blame for poverty on the victims of poverty, when you should be blaming the systems in place that require poor people to exist for said system to be successful. You should be arguing for social services to actually be available to help people have their children and be successful at it).\n\nI have no desire to continue interacting with you, and I have a feeling you have no desire to continue interacting with me.", "Oh yeah. She should totally always hold it against her parents for taking 20 years to be successful. What fucking assholes it was for them to take so long to finish school and land a better job. \n\nThey totally should send the little sister to an inner city school. Screw her!!", "Not when her little sibling gets everything she currently has (paid for college and rent) PLUS the stuff like vacations, nice phone, new clothes, they all add up", "HAHHAHAHHAAHA suggesting that people shouldn\u2019t sit in their poverty when they have kids is not fucking eugenics. Saying someone is an asshole for having a kid and taking almost a decade to realize they should do something about their poverty is not eugenics. Absolutely insane to suggest that. Thank you for the laugh.", "They didn\u2019t try. That\u2019s what you\u2019re not understanding. OP didn\u2019t acknowledge that their situation needed to be changed until almost a decade into their child\u2019s life. They knew they were poor, knew they were struggling, and waited almost a DECADE to do anything. Then took another decade actually doing the thing. \n\nShe should hold it over her parents that they were comfortable raising her in poverty. No one is suggesting to treat the little sister poorly. We\u2019re saying punishing Sam for having justified feelings and lashing out is what makes OP the asshoel.", "Didn't you know that unless you give every child the exact same childhood, then you're a horrible parent who should do [insert violent vitriol that normally makes up the commenters on this sub]? Add in the usual \"poor people shouldn't have kids\" eugenics argument, too, since they always go hand in hand.\n\n/s", "And that's exactly what I knew what would happen. Thanks for proving me right, once again, when it comes to this discussion. I bet you also think physically disabled or mentally ill people shouldn't have kids either. The kind who think poor people shouldn't have kids usually don't limit it to just the poor. \n\nHope you can be less classist in the future, but it takes actual work to overcome one's bigoted ideology.", "She literally is going to college debt free. She isn\u2019t getting scraps at all. Sam has unresolved trauma, but OP isn\u2019t an AH for giving Kathy a better childhood because she now can afford it. My wife and I were VERY broke for our first two kids. But, things got better and our three youngest have no memory of us being poor at all.", "When did I claim all parents are evil for making mistakes lmao. There\u2019s a difference between a mistake and forcing poverty on your child for their entire life because it took you almost two decades to get your shit together.", "LMAO. Just because I\u2019m smart enough to understand the situation doesn\u2019t mean I have \u201cmommy issues.\u201d"]}
