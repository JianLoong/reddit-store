However , I think that your choice is not the ideal solution, it will only harbor more resentment and I diubt you want to distance your daughter. I suggest you try to speak to her, maybe also suggest therapy(which you could pay as she probably wouldnt go otherwise). \n\nI feel it is normal to be jelous having grown the way she did and seeing how differemt it is for her sister, but she should also understand that she always got the best you could offer(now she is also getting spoiled) and so is her sister.", "Going with NTA. Most people grow and change as they get older and have more life experiences. Not all siblings grow up under the same economic conditions. Is it fair? Nope but Sam thinking because her childhood was harder than her sister's that Kathy should have a tough childhood as well is ridiculous. I understand her feelings of jealousy and unfairness but to think Kathy should live the same childhood circumstances when it's not necessary is unreasonable and unrealistic. Talk to your oldest. You are doing your best right now to help them get ahead in life by covering college education and expenses. You can't change the past.", "YTA\n\nShe clearly has trauma from growing up that way and living the struggle, though she is getting some help from you now to her it looks like her sister got the childhood she dreamed of.

It's the way of life that children are raised differently when there are age gaps. OP mentions in the comments that they were making progress financially and career-wise just before the recession, so the recession completely set back any progress they'd made and then some. By the time OP was able to enact the changes that would lead to an improved life for the whole family, the benefit would be felt most by the youngest. It is what it is. Getting financially stable takes time. \n\nAs the youngest in my family, I got a different childhood than the oldest in my family. My parents were older and more laid back with me, but due to the recession, I got no assistance with college. My sibling, on the other hand, had significant help with college and was able to start working in their career field just before the recession struck. While the financial ramifications have dramatically affected my ability to build wealth by comparison, I would not EVER wish my older sibling had had less help, so it would be more \"equal.\" It would be incredibly toxic if I wished ill on somebody I love. As for my parents, they did the best they could with the knowledge they had at the time. \n\n The daughter seems really entitled and is letting it embitter her. Most people can't afford to fund their children's college and pay for their rent (that's great that she had access to that privilege, especially after growing up in a low-income house).  The daughter is allowed to have her feelings and be upset, but the second she wished suffering onto her sibling, she crossed a line. \n\nDo I think she deserved to be completely cut-off? I would have likely tried something less drastic if I were OP.  (Ie. requiring the daughter go to therapy if she wanted housing/phone assistance, etc.) \n\nOverall, I think ESH. The daughter is bitter and acting toxic. OP should have responded in some fashion, but I think they went a bit overboard without ever addressing the underlying issues.", "NTA.\n\nUnless she gets some therapy to deal wit her jealousy and learn to accept that sometimes life is really freaking unfair, this won't resolve itself. Her feelings of unfairness are valid. Her demands that her sister suffer because she did are not. \n\nOlder daughter needs to understand that you didn't WANT things to suck for her and that you regret that they did. She needs to accept that you can't change the past. So, she's TA for not being able to see that and be grateful that things are better, and not being reasonable about you doing the best you could with what resources you had available to you. \n\nYou also can't beat yourself up about how things have turned out. Don't be guilted into doing all kinds of expensive things to \"make up for\" her earlier years.  You've been paying for college and vacations and providing the opportunities that you can for her now that you are in a position to do so. That's sufficient. As an adult, at some point she has to take those responsibilities on for herself. Don't let her guilt you into doing this for the rest of her life or she'll never really grow up.", "YTA. You need family therapy and to sit down with your daughters and partner) you said we realized things need to change so I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s another parent in the picture. \n\nWhen you realized things needed to change, you were around less for Sam during years where Sam can remember this but Kathy can\u2019t. Sam: grew up poor, parent gone at work and classes all the time until she was an adult. Kathy had a at least a middle class life with 2 adults around for 2/3 of her childhood. \n\nIt\u2019s a no brainer why Sam is jealous and resentful. She wasn\u2019t important enough for you to change her circumstances but her younger sister was? She\u2019s spent over a decade living with that resentment, having to work harder, and seeing her sister get opportunities she never had. \n\nWhen she was 14, she was probably worried about how she would even be able to go to college. Her sister never had to go through that. \n\nThere\u2019s a difference between equality and equity. Equality would be giving them both the same resources, which at this point, you didn\u2019t do and can\u2019t fix. \n\nEquity would be making this up to Sam by doing more for her as an adult. For example: if she wants to go to grad school, contributing more to that as she was at an educational disadvantage. When buying a home, contribute more to the down payment. Maybe offer to help Sam upgrade her current wardrobe or contribute to a trip she\u2019d like to take with her friends. Things that help her feel like she\u2019s being taken care of in the way she never was as a child. But threatening to stop paying her rent is cruel. \n\nYou will need to have a conversation with Kathy about why this is happening, so she understands that you\u2019re helping Sam in a way you weren\u2019t capable of doing when Sam was younger and that Kathy is fortunate to have these opportunities her sister did not.", "YTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t bother trying to better your life until you gave birth to Kathy.

They failed Sam, and now they\u2019re punishing her for being angry about it. Of course Sam snapped. \n\nSam has every right to be upset her parents were fine with her situation until Kathy came along.", "It took until Kathy was born for OP to decide to do better.", "I imagine OP wanted to change things even before that, but it\u2019s quite hard when you have debt, etc. Sam didn\u2019t have a great childhood and  it\u2019s fine to be jealous, but to wish her sister has it the same way is cruel. Sam is still incredibly lucky to have a mom that provides for her now, with college, vacation etc.", "YTA this 100 percent.

Circumstances can change drastically in 8 years, and the cycle of poverty is hard to escape. Bravo to you for turning things around, I'm sure it wasn't easy. Your oldest daughter may be justified in feeling some envy but her anger is misplaced. Can she not see what you sacrificed to provide for her and her sister? She should be grateful that you're paying her rent and tuition (something I assume was probably not provided to you). She should be happy for her sister that she has it better than she did growing up, and thankful for what assistance you're able to provide now. If you can afford it, I wouldn't cut off her rent money, because that would just deepen the divide between her and the rest of the family; still I would sit her down and explain how hard you worked to be able to provide a better life for both your children, and though she didn't get to see those rewards as a child she gets to experience them now.", "ESH. Neither daughter should have anything taken away from them. Sam only takes on about 10% AH for imagining a life of poverty for her own sister. She was just trying to express her resentment, but for something like this? Emotions run high and pain cuts oh so deeply. \n\nEvery luxury, big and small, Kathy receives is a punch to the gut for Sam. I can't believe she actually wants her sister to have her childhood. How in the ever-loving fuck can a father not see his child has been hurting and he's done nothing about it. \n\nWhat exactly are they supposed to do except apologize and get therapy? Should they monetize their apology in some manner? \n\nI think OP is a little myopic in their view of the situation to even consider taking anything from Sam now. Like, wow! She's still really young and sometimes everything comes out all at once and you end up saying horrible things.", "Sorry, but YTA.

She 100% has had different opportunities than us and my parents have been able to provide more for her in every way. I don\u2019t hold that against my sibling at all. I think it\u2019s nice that you are paying for college and an apartment for Sam. I had to work through college, have massive debt, and wish that my parents were able to help more with that. Ultimately, it\u2019s not their responsibility though. Good on you for helping Sam, but she needs a reality check.", "Agree or not oldest ones are always jealous even if they don't show it they feel jealous because how they struggled with their parents, grew with them,learned life in the hard way while the younger ones are all enjoying what the oldest needed and wanted but couldn't and still can't because parents still have this vision that thier older ones are understanding and they can tell them to adjust.

And I can\u2019t help feeling sad when my sister brags about all of her expensive game consoles and toys that she just leaves on the ground.

Change happens when the pain of change is less than the pain of staying the same. I'm sorry that Sam is struggling with envy, it's understandable that she is, but unfortunately you cannot go back in time and fix her childhood. And you are still providing her financial support now, rent and tuition still puts her massively ahead of most of her peers, regardless of the rest of her childhood. Cutting her off will only reinforce her belief in the inequality between her and her sister, so I would reinstate those payments.\n\nThere's a difference between being unable to provide something and refusing to provide it. You did not refuse to provide your oldest a wealthier childhood, you were unable to. Posters are essentially positing that you refused to, which is a massive error. OP doesn't love her second daughter more simply because that pregnancy was the catalyst for her realizing she needed to make a change, and that she's able to provide Kathy a more financially stable life now. Again, there's a difference between unwilling and unable.\n\nI think you all need family therapy though, big time. There is clearly serious hurt on Sam's part.

(The more common reaction). Sam is the latter and it's not her fault.  \n\nYou need to foster the relationship between the sisters. Your younger daughter needs to understand the struggles that Sam had and Sam needs to understand that adding struggle to her sister's life when not necessary is not going to fix her own childhood. \n\nI'm saying yta because of the threat to no longer support her.

Remember Kathy also went through 10 years of poverty too so she didn\u2019t receive special treatment at all from their mom. They both now receive full support from their mom as she is able to give it. Poverty sucks ass but to sit there and blame the mother as if she\u2019s treating her kids differently is wrong.

We have no information about why OP didn\u2019t/couldn\u2019t get out of poverty sooner, but it sounds like she did her best for her kids and it just took longer than would be ideal. So shaming a mom for being poor and taking \u201ctoo long\u201d to get more financially stable is pretty cruel. \n\nI\u2019m going NAH, because it sounds like OP did what she could for her kids.

You seem to lack the life experience to understand you can\u2019t just choose to make more money. If you could everybody would do that and nobody would be poor. Most likely OP grew up in poverty and it took them time to realize they had other pathways available to them, and they worked hard to make that happen.

But that doesn't change the fact that you had a much harder process than someone who was middle/upper middle class.

However, she\u2019s so ready to take support away from her older daughter. Her answer to it all was cutting what support she did have for her daughter? That\u2019s incredibly callous in my opinion. No, the older daughter shouldn\u2019t feel resentment towards her younger sister, but her mother has no empathy towards her. \n\nI know OP must\u2019ve had a hard time as well but she chose to be a parent and to have a second child. She was prepared to treat her daughter like that. I know you think we\u2019re all entitled but we\u2019re looking at the situation within context, not within other people\u2019s personal experiences where they had no support from their parents after 18. Her younger sister gets so much more and everything from their mother. The overwhelming majority of people would feel resentment because of that. It\u2019s not about how she\u2019s treated relative to strangers on the internet who say they were independent and didn\u2019t rely on any of that support, but how she\u2019s treated relative to her sister.\n\nIf I had to guess, the older daughter feels as if her mother loves her younger daughter more. And to be honest, I haven\u2019t seen much of anything in this post that shows OP has the same love for her older daughter. As for your second paragraph, whether she likes it or not, she DID only begin to work towards a better future when her younger child was born. There are likely many reasons but in the eyes of the older daughter, it probably feels like she wasn\u2019t enough.", "Just to clear a couple things up.... She's not a single mother. In her comments she said she and her husband had a hard time during the 2008 recession. At that point she was pregnant with her second child and they decided to do better. So yes, I'll take her at her word that that's when they made the decision. \n\nGood that she made the decision that change her situation. That doesn't really address the current issue the older daughter is having, though. I think the best option may be to not cut the daughter off but require and pay for her to go to counseling.\n\nI don't think the little sister should be penalized for something out of her control. That would be ridiculous.", "Still dealing with it at 53 and firmly middle class", "Well said.", "As someone who grew up pretty poor id personally be happier to see my siblings get things we couldn't afford when I was younger.

If you're an adult, you can love however you want, poor, homeless, in dirt. But if you want to have a child, you actually need to think about them and what's best for them, not you.

She does have the right to her own feelings of jealousy though, in all honesty I think it\u2019s ESH here.\n\nYOU however, are an asshole for jumping down my throat for nothing.

I was in Older daughters situation years ago. I grew up poor and when I was in college I saw my sister who was much younger than me getting a much better childhood than I had. Difference is my parents made no effort to make up for it. No paid rent, no paid school, none of it. I was over 18 and basically on my own. I now owe a ton of student loan debt, my credit sucks, and I can\u2019t get approval to purchase a home even though I have a decent income my loans overshadow any savings I could possibly have. \n\nAt least OP is trying to help her financially now.
