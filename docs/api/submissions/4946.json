He may have sold you the property to wipe his hands of it, or even as a favor to you, especially since you paid \"what you thought was fair\"...In my experience what the buyer and seller consider fair, is usually very different. He may have been under the impression he gave you a good deal as a favor, or so he didn't have to deal with it anymore due to grief, and too be expected too pay you 5k after that may have put him over the edge. \n\nI have a huge feeling if the property was sold, or went to auction, and then these fees came up he would've happily paid them, even though he didn't expect them. \n\nLegally you had every right to sue, however, morally, I'm not so sure, at very least could you not have waited till greif has passed? I suspect you got a good deal on the property and as he is family, and most likely gave you a good deal, the least you could've done is cover his 5k of taxes he wasn't aware had to be paid well after the sale of the house.", "It's unfair, yes, and from a legal standpoint you are NTA. However it all boils down to one honest question : do you feel it was worth it losing a brother over 10k?", "Was the total back taxes 10k total? Or his half? Why were there back taxes anyways, straight property tax? Did he not pay his half during his ownership? Did your parents own the house straight out? I would think that the back taxes would be split as well, and his responsibility should have been 5k, not 10k, if anything. That's why I'm leaning to TA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Of course, logical arguments don't usually go far with illogical people.", "It's a good example of how what is legal and what is emotional don't align.  Emotions aren't beholden to logic.  They feel what they feel, that doesn't make them right.  \n\nFeelings don't mean that you're necessarily right, and being right doesn't always feel good.\n\nNTA", "Perhaps the brother who tried to foist all of the tax debt onto OP is the real asshole, yeah?", "This. 100%", "NTA. But, I have a question. Your brother was willing to screw you out of literally tens of thousands of dollars. He seems to think that was his right. Why are you concerned that you don't talk to him anymore? Sounds sort of like the trash may have taken itself out to me.", "ESH\n\nAll of this could have been avoided if you would have done this the right way.  Get multiple estimates for the sale, and agreeing in ten estimate.  Then getting a real estate/mortgage professional involved,  who would have pro rated any taxes, liens, debts and fees, and done this the legal and equitable way.  Instead you both tried to save a buck, and in the end it cost you your relationship.", "What is even the point of this post? If you get NTA are you going to print it out and send it to your brother and demand that he be your friend again?\n\nYou made your choices and he made his. It really doesn't matter who's right and wrong - you are both within your rights to have made the choices you've made. There is no outcome where you get the money and your brother, no matter how right or wrong either of you are. so it kind of sounds like you're being a sore winner.", "Wow, not letting someone rob you is now robbing that person. NTA", "I don't think you need reddit's AITA to weigh in on whether you were right that you two were both responsible for the taxes. A legal court already weighed in and ruled that you two were both responsible for the taxes.\n\nCould you have negotiated without involving courts? Maybe, but it sounds like you tried. What was your brother's suggested resolution aside from \"he doesn't pay his fair share\"?\n\nNTA", "NTA but actions have consequences so you have to consider the cost as you move forward\u2026 right wrong or indifferent is something you have to decide and then live with\u2026", "NTA", "NTA, he knew he had the responsibility for his share of the taxes and sold his share to you without disclosing he hadn't paid so you would be left having to pay for his share.  Good riddance and be happy.", "Info: how was your relationship before this? You said he was miserly and entitled, which I tend to agree with given the situation. Could it be that he has an old axe to grind and he's finally got his excuse to go no contact? Has he been complaining to mutual family? \n\nMy mom and my aunt did this exact same situation after my grandma died 12ish years ago. They never got over it but were able to be civil in the same room after a few years.", "NTA but it's not surprising him and the family have disowned you. This was always going to happen once it went legal.\n\nNow buckle you for the second wave... House price appreciation!! Oh yes. Give it a few years and he will see houses in the same area being sold for way more than you had it apprised for and you're going to be the bad guy all over again!!\n\n\nAt the end of the day this is all your lawyers fault. Whoever was responsible for the legalities of the sale should have sorted this out at the time before any money or deeds changed hands. Even if the amount wasn't known, the fact that there would be an amount should have been discussed and clarified that it's owed by both of you equally.", "I read something somewhere that said, \u201cdo you want to be happy or do you want to be right?\u201d In this case, legally, yeah, you were entitled to the money, but if the only way to get the $5,000 was to take your brother to court\u2026was it worth it? Surely you had to understand that this would damage your relationship. Idk that there are necessarily any assholes here, it\u2019s just a matter of priorities\u2014what means more to you? $5k or a relationship w your brother?", "Legally, you\u2019re  NTA. Even morally it seems that\u2019s what\u2019s fair.\nHowever, if you think that that amount of tax money is worth ruining your relationship with your brother, then good for you.", "INFO: How did you close on the property with the taxes due and owing? At least where I live, title companies won't do that.", "ESH You and your brother have valued your relationship at $5,000. Ouch.", "NTA. You were both responsible for the back taxes. Sorry for the loss of your parents and now your brother and his family.", "YTA\n\nI know it\u2019s not a popular opinion and legally you were obviously within your rights but hear me out.\n\nYour brother and you couldn\u2019t sell the home because you said he wanted more than it was worth. When you showed interest in buying it you paid him a fair \u201cfix-t-up\u201d price. So it sounds like once you decided to buy it he did sell it at the cheaper price because you are his brother. He made a concession so you could buy the family home then you sued him. YTA", "NTA. He tried to dick you over and you weren't having any of it. Just because someone is blood relation doesn't make them true family.", "Wanna take bets that if you go ahead and fix the house up, sell it, and make a nice profit, that your brother will expect part of the profits. NTA", "NTA - you had the law on your side. Unfortunately, your brother feels differently. He is entitled to his feelings as long as he pays what is owed. It is sad but finances usually ruins family relationships. Your can\u2019t force him to speak with you. Which is sad. All I can say is just try and move past this. Maybe with time he will come around and you can mend your relationship.", "A judge sided with OP, so it's relatively safe to assume OP was right.  \n\nThe reassessment was probably triggered by the sale.  But it sounds more like a situation where it was originally taxed as \"owner occupied\" at a low rate.  Then after it passed down, that partial exemption became incorrect, since neither op nor brother lived in the home.", "Some places, when a property is sold, there is a lot of grandfathering that becomes void and the land is re-assessed. Happened at my job. Tax bill was 2k before the owner bought the land. All of the grandfathering that waived the bill for increased value on improvements and such since the 70's expired on n new ownership and we got hit with an 8k supplemental bill in addition to the regular one. Nobody disclosed any of that prior to sale, so we have a lawyer looking at it to see if the lack of disclosure is something we can take the responsible party to court for.", "I think a big issue for him is that the money you paid him for his half?  He already spent the majority of it, and the tax money was more than he had left from it all.", "So he checkmated himself. Bravo.", "Moreover, the full length of time this property was incorrectly being taxed was caused by brother, since he prevented OP from selling the whole house at market rate sooner.", "I think you\u2019re assuming that because you\u2019re not the asshole here and that thr law was on your side, your brother is going to react positively. You can be 100% in the right and still irrevocably damage your relationship. I\u2019m not saying you were wrong to sue him, but I am saying that when you get to the point of suing a family member, your relationship is going to be severely damaged, regardless of whether or not you are in the right.", "I think OP was just kind of na\u00efve, thinking it was all going to blow over and everybody was going to join hands and sing Kumbaya once the court ruled."]}
