Legally he was responsible, and you already paid however much for ownership.", "NTA, the law says you had the right so he should not be mad.\nYou divided the inheritance based on law, bought/seld the house based on that too, so you will do it for the bill as well!", "You\u2019re NTA, but when you took it to court you definitely chose the hill to die on.\n\nI\u2019m sorry he stitches you up like that, and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re no contact now, might be for the best in the long run though", "NTA, you proved you were right in court. Your brother has been an A for years. If he wants to sulk and not speak to you, that's his loss.", "NTA.  The tax bill is for the owners.  He was an owner when the tax was assessed.  He was an AH for trying to dodge his tax bill by using the flimsy excuse that \"you are the owner now\".", "If he'd agreed to sell the home for market value in the first place, the taxes bill probably wouldn't have been that bad. He forced you to buy him out and he forced you to owe more in back taxes. I agree that he was responsible for this. You can't seriously expect to maintain a positive relationship after you sue your own family though.", "He was in position to pay, I did give him money for half the house. I did try to talk to him, but he wouldn\u2019t hear any of it. In his opinion, he was no longer owner of the house so all prior debts. were now my responsibility. And I went no contact, because there was no way to communicate with him because he was angry. He had to pay.", "NTA. I\u2019m not sure why the back taxes were not settled before the house was transferred, in most countries that would be required. Clearly you were right in a legal sense, since you won the case. Only you can decide if it was worth losing your brother over.", "Perhaps, the $5000 is a lot of money to some after I paid him for his share of the house and had to take on the responsibility of repairs on my own accord", "NTA - I don\u2019t understand the Y T A votes. If you and your brother had sold the house to a stranger, the stranger would NOT be responsible for the back taxes. The government would still hold you AND you brother accountable for those taxes. Why should it be different just because you are the new owner?", "NTA what a crappy situation though", "NTA. Had this been a stranger buying the home he would owe. Not sure why he felt he didn't have to. You sued because you had no choice. He needs to learn simply rules on real estate ownership, which is why you won in court.", "NTA, its fair that everything was split when both of you were responsible for the stuff. If he think's its unfair, then wait until he slowly comes to realization as he gets older. Until then just get on with life.", "NTA. You should not pay for all taxes when you had joined ownership of the house, or if you did, it should have been deducted from the price of his share of the property. Especially considering you had an agreement to share the costs associated with the house. \nIf you brought a house from a stranger and discovered afterwards that there were BT, you would not be responsible either, and suing the previous owner would not make you an AH. It is the same here, except that it is about a 50% share of a property, not all of it.", "Would he have felt the same habe you received the same amount in returns? No? Didn\u2019t think so. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nBut think hard about this, is 5000 dollars worth the end of your relationship with your brother? Because that's what's going to happen.", "I think if the law clearly states that whoever owned the house when the taxes were incurred pays the back taxes then probably NTA. Sometimes, when the law is vague enough, it really comes down to whoever has the better lawyer. \n\nBut like, why didn't you put in the contract when you bought his share, that you would share bills incurred during co-ownership? Seems like that could have been anticipated. Doing anything financial with family..always put everything you can think of on the contract.", "[deleted]", "ESH.\n\nWant to clarify that I agree with what you said about him also being responsible (**ASSUMING** everything you said is in fact true and this amount was incurred while he had joint ownership) and that it was a dick move of him to dump that in you.\n\nHowever I don't think there will ever be a time when suing your own family isn't a dick move also. I understand why you did it, and judging by the fact you won (pending an appeal of course) suggests you were legally in the right, still isn't any less of an AH thing to do.", "ETA \n\n...You lost your brother over 5k, whilst legally you were right, there's a lot more than simple law going on here. He may have sold you the property to wipe his hands of it, or even as a favor to you, especially since you paid \"what you thought was fair\"...In my experience what the buyer and seller consider fair, is usually very different. He may have been under the impression he gave you a good deal as a favor, or so he didn't have to deal with it anymore due to grief, and too be expected too pay you 5k after that may have put him over the edge. \n\nI have a huge feeling if the property was sold, or went to auction, and then these fees came up he would've happily paid them, even though he didn't expect them. \n\nLegally you had every right to sue, however, morally, I'm not so sure, at very least could you not have waited till greif has passed? I suspect you got a good deal on the property and as he is family, and most likely gave you a good deal, the least you could've done is cover his 5k of taxes he wasn't aware had to be paid well after the sale of the house.", "It's unfair, yes, and from a legal standpoint you are NTA. However it all boils down to one honest question : do you feel it was worth it losing a brother over 10k?", "Was the total back taxes 10k total? Or his half? Why were there back taxes anyways, straight property tax? Did he not pay his half during his ownership? Did your parents own the house straight out? I would think that the back taxes would be split as well, and his responsibility should have been 5k, not 10k, if anything. That's why I'm leaning to TA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That absolutely happens in families, rarely will the other party have an epiphany to see your point of view. The question now becomes do you want to have a relationship going forward with your brother? If you do, you need patience. His family is going to rally around him and feed all sorts of negativity about you to him, they're all going to say this was unfair they're all going to say you were brutal blah blah blah blah blah. With the benefit of age, may I suggest you patience and saying less is more.\n\nYou don't need to debate the situation, the facts are the facts, if it comes up with anybody all you simply say is your brother and I incurred some debts on the house when we owned it together, it was brought to our attention and we could not agree on an equitable resolution, I brought it to court to have a neutral party make the decision.\n\nOvertime if you want a relationship with your brother the approach might be can we put this aside and focus on our relationship? You may not like how I handled this situation as I do not like how you handled it however we are still siblings and I love you, but sometimes when you love a family member you don't always agree with their behaviors Can we agree on this one that we don't agree with each other's perspective?

They aren't going to understand if you explain your side well enough, and you would be the asshole if you don't let it go. Give them space, be generous with them in the future, and maybe you could rebuild that bridge, but for now it's burnt up and washed out.\n\nAt the end of the day you chose to go after them in court, and even if you were justified, this is the obvious consequence of your actions.", "NTA", "I\u2019m going against the majority here to say ESH.

Usually, the title company does a search for leins and taxes before the paperwork is signed.  I've purchased 2 houses in the metro Detroit (Wayne County) area, and this was done both times.
