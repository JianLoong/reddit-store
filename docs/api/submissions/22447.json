Are your kids in therapy? I don't think that you are doing anyone, especially Stuart, any favors by keeping the truth from your kids about the divorce. I would recommend getting all of you into therapy and working with the therapist to tell them the truth about why you left. I think that it's admirable that you didn't throw their dad under the bus, but it is impacting your relationship with them.", "YTA for not being honest with your children during the divorce.\n\nYTA for not being honest with your children now.\n\nYTA for yelling at a child in the hospital (I get it; we yell when we worry about our kids).\n\nSend Stuart out and sit down with your sons and let them know the truth about their father -- that you didn't 'just up and leave' their dad, that he cheated on you, that he doesn't even show up half the time. Tell them that they don't have to love Stuart as a father, but they better d\\*mn well respect him as your husband and as someone who is doing his best to help you raise your sons to be good men. That's likely to make you N T A.\n\nGood luck because you might have left it too long.\n\nWhen I divorced my ex, I kept my son appraised of what I was doing and why... in 4-year-old terms.\n\nETA: And Stuart deserves lots of kudos as well as apologies from your sons.", "What he did was incredibly stupid and irresponsible and it could have cost him his life, and he needs to understand this loud and clear so your not an AH for loosing your temper after having such and scary and hard night and seeing your son being so ungrateful.\n\nHowever, it seems like you want to dictate how your sons feel about your husband, you want them to love him and accept him as a father figure so you can get the happy sitcom family. And I'm sure your husband is great, the thing is your boys were ten and twelve years old when you divorce their father with no apparent reason and then a year later, in their eyes, you found a replacement so all the anger and resentment for their broken family are being directed to him. \n\nNow if you don't want to tell them straight away that their father is a cheater, you at least need to sit with them and explain them that he didn't respect it you, \"my ex constant undermining me with the kids or him always trying to be the \" good/fun one\" and that cause irreparable damage to the relationship, ask them if they would like to talk to a therapist, some who can help them make peace with your separation.\n\nSo YTA, not for yelling, but for being ok with the fact that after four years your kids still hold resentment for the separation and doing nothing about it.", "YTA - Perhaps you should tell your kids what really went down between you and their dad? They are old enough to know.", "Dear the problem here is that you did not say the truth of the divorce because they maybe Young but not stupid to not understanding the fact that you two divorced for whatever reasonn but you did the right thing because If not your husband recognize the overdose he may not even be alive and pardon for my english its not my First language", "You should have gotten your kids a therapist. There are age appropriate ways to explain what is going on, and why the divorce is happening.\n\nEven now, they're struggling hard. Get them help. tell them the truth. You don't deserve their hate for their father's wrongdoing.", "Once when my Dad yelled at me when I was hospitalized, the nurses wanted to ban him from seeing me \nYTA and you might want to consider how you can be banned if you don\u2019t learn to control yourself", "soft yta, he can feel how he wants about stuart if he doesn\u2019t want him there he simply doesn\u2019t want him there. now yelling at him for doing drugs is fine! he deserved to be yelled at for that but you can\u2019t force your child to like your husband.", "YTA. First, Stuart sounds like a good guy and is trying, that is to his credit 100%! But, from your kids' point of view, you left their dad for no reason and married someone else a short time later. It's very reasonable they are going to hate him even if he's a good guy. As long as you don't tell them the truth, you can't complain about how they treat your husband. Oh, but yelling at him for doing cocaine, yes, he deserved that part of it 100%!", "Time to level with your sons about their father.", "NTA. But time for the truth to come out. Time for some honest back and forth communication. Your children deserve that much from you. They have NOT adjusted well through the break up of their core family.  Perhaps professional therapy and family counseling is way past due.", "YTA for yelling at a kid who's in obvious pain. NTA for having a human reaction. I think it's time you get a family therapist to help out. Your son naturally wants his Dad's love and is not receiving it. The anger, sneaking out ,drug use are all signs he's in a lot of pain. He shouldn't be taking his anger out on step dad. That's not right, and there should be a clear boundary regarding this. At the same time he needs some way of expressing his anger. He needs help. He also needs the truth at an age appropriate level.", "NAH. Yelling at your kid was not cool, but it was a high stress situation and emotions are understandably high. However, you really need to sit down and talk with your kids about why the divorce happened. It\u2019s good that you don\u2019t shit talk the dad, but they\u2019re old enough to understand what happened if you explain it rationally.", "Nope, NTA. And normally I vote against screaming parents for just about any reason, but in this case you are 100% in your rights.  Going forth, I would try to handle the conversation a bit more rationally, but in this specific situation, your freak-out might have even been a wakeup call for the kid.  I highly recommend family therapy for you guys", "Boy howdy. NTA for this I guess but get your kids some therapy", "YTA", "YTA. Because this didn't happen.", "YTA. But only because you don\u2019t seem to have an understanding of why your child is lashing out. Your obliviousness to HIS obliviousness is almost comical. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t know about the affair. He was old enough to know what was going on (in terms of the divorce) but he truly believes it came out of nowhere. Add that just a year later you meet another man and try to get him to play Daddy. . . Well no wonder the kid is messed up and seeking some sort of relief through rebellion. \n\nLike it or not, your ex husband is their FATHER. He is their real father and there is nothing you can do to shake that bond. ESPECIALLY considering you haven\u2019t told them the truth of your ex\u2019s affair. Don\u2019t get mad at your son for not accepting Stuart as their dad. He is not their dad.", "NTA.", "well, YTA kinda,\n\nbecause in general, taking up positions against someone *you've carried in your belly for 9 months* in favor of *someone you've met in a bar* is questionable, at least", "NTA, you're teaching your son to be grateful. Especially for his life. Poor Stuart.", "NTA You were in a high stress situation and I\u2019m not going to judge you for snapping a little. but honestly what do you expect? It drives me bonkers when people hide negative information about others to preserve their relationship with the kids and then get angry when the relationship is actually preserved! The whole point of not telling them was so they could love their dad unreservedly. This is the cost - to them it looks like you left for no reason and then moved on like it was nothing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You were a parent that nearly lost her child so were understandably upset at his absolute stupidity. Then him going off on the man that saved his life, pushed you over the edge. Most parents, in your shoes, would have done the same thing. You go from hoping/praying your kid will survive to chewing them out the moment they are safe, for worrying you, for risking their life so stupidly.\n\nIt is time you told your boys, though I suspect it is too late. Your ex has already filled their heads with his version for years. Family counseling is needed. The boys have never properly recovered from your divorce and your ex is deliberately exacerbating their mental health for his own purposes, making Stuart's integration into the family almost impossible. Making stupid mistakes in the teen years can come from the pain of a difficult family life.\n\nKoodoes to Stuart. He was in the right place in the right time. Hopefully your boy will eventually realize how much he has misjudged the man. \n\nNow you have a lot of work trying to undo the brainwashing your ex has done before you lose both of your sons. Bring in the professionals ASAP.", "NTA. \n\nIt seems like a lot of other commenters are not recognizing potential signs of \u201cparental alienation\u201d, which is when one parent, in this case your ex, drives a wedge in between the other parent (you) and the children.  This is a tactic often used by abusive people after a relationship is over. Obviously I can\u2019t know for sure because there aren\u2019t a lot of details, but this sounds like parental alienation because your ex was always undermining you, now isn\u2019t showing up, and swoops in as the \u201cfun one\u201d. It sounds like your ex has planted some ideas in your kids heads about you \u201cup and leaving\u201d and is probably making the entire separation seem like your fault to the kids\u2014another abusive tactic. Ex is probably bad-mouthing Stuart, too. Other commenters are suggesting that you tell your kids the truth, which I can certainly understand where they\u2019re coming from, but any good custody lawyer would tell you not to talk negatively about the other parent, and sometimes judges even write that into custody agreements!! it makes sense to me why you didn\u2019t tell your kids about the affair, because i\u2019m guessing you still want them to have a relationship with their dad, it could look badly on your part in court, your ex would likely deny that and your kids might not believe you anyway based on how extreme their behavior and emotions about you and stuart sound. please don\u2019t feel bad for not telling your kids despite other commenters faulting you for that.\nObviously it\u2019s not great to yell, but I can understand how all of the adrenaline and fear of that situation and your frustration built up and caused you to react that way.\nIt sounds like your ex is the asshole in this situation. I would consider researching more into parental alienation and getting connected with some local support! You sound like a really great mom and I\u2019m glad you have a partner who sounds like he really cares about you and your kids. I wish you good luck.", "She may be legally bound by the custody agreement not to discuss the infidelity in order to protect the fathers relationship with the children. That\u2019s a pretty common thing", "Only problem is that the kids think OP left their father for no reason then hooked up with this guy after just a little while. He sounds like a decent guy, but of course they're going to hate him, that's OPs fault for not being honest with her kids. Her screaming about cocaine use yes that was 100% right."]}
