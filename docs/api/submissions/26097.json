At every point he kept commenting on how much space I had for myself, etc\u2026 \n\nAfter the 5 days he was supposed to stay, he asked for a couple more until some money came in so he could buy a bus ticket and continue his travels. I agreed, not so enthusiastic anymore. Around day 10 I started asking him more and more about his departure. He was always saying things like \u201cbut cmon, this flat is pretty big, I can\u2019t be bothering that much\u201d. \nAt day 15 I started telling him directly he had to leave. By day 20 it was an everyday reminder he had to leave asap. \n\nDay 30 came in, he said that the money was sent to a neighbouring town by mistake and that the train would not get to there on time on saturday, so he would wait for monday. \nI said \u201cfuck it, pack your shit, we are going to pick up that money and then you can continue your travels from there. I\u2019ll drive.\u201d\n\nWe arrived to the place, and lo and behold, the money had not arrived. Since he had already all his shit with him, i just ditched him on the town square.

I never thought he would do that, i had spent time with him in the past and he was visiting the city, and I had a guest room. I assumed he actually had a bus/plane/train ticket and that he had planned only 5 days in the city.. i mean, he wasn\u2019t a hobo when i met him before. I don\u2019t think he is a hobo at all..", "created_utc": 1693657509, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16816qb/aita_for_kicking_a_guy_out_of_my_house/", "score": 240, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I cant see how you could have handled the situation differently, the guy obviously didnt want to leave anytime soon and didnt appreciate you and your generosity. the way you left him there is not the sweetest but he totally deserved that, he had left you no other option. you warned him plenty of times and he was SO disrespectful towards you. sorry you had to go through this, be careful next time<3", "NTA but I have no idea why you got yourself into this mess in the first place.

After five, he should have been out with his obviously bad behavior.  It\u2019s not a dick move to hold people to the agreement they made.  You don\u2019t owe this guy anything.
