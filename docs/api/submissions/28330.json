My parents had already taught me and my sister about it by that age as well. I still remember having to save up to get a Gameboy that I wanted at that age and how long it took while I wanted to buy other things.\n\nA possible thing to try, depending on your situation, might be to allow both girls to earn a bit more through chores? I got a weekly pocket money for doing regular things like keeping my room tidy, making the bed etc, but I could get a bit more by doing extra chores around the house like cleaning the bathroom, vacuuming etc. Might not work if both girls have a list of chores they already need to do to earn money but it could potentially incentivise Emma to earn more and understand that way the value of earning/saving/having more money?

I'm in a similar situation at the moment with my kids. One has a Saturday job, and her brothers think it's very unfair I don't bump up their allowance to match her earnings from her job, because they want the same money as her, and all they see is her getting her allowance AND money on top. I think it takes some children a while to understand-they see me getting money out of an ATM and think its free money. I don't think it's wrong at all to say what you did-it's an important life lesson. But learning to save doesn't come easy to some children-I think some need more concrete guidance, like having a savings account and being able to physically see the amount in the account going up week by week. I know my boys save better by having an account rather than cash-in-hand-having the money in an account where they have to draw it out from seems to make them think a bit more about their purchases and stops them spontaneously splurging on crap.", "NTA good parenting.

That\u2019s utterly ridiculous. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You are doing the right thing. You can take this a step further by showing your younger daughter HOW to save for nicer things.

Give her positive reinforcement and praise as the amount grows and make a huge deal of going with her to get the thing whenever she saves up for it.", "I think it\u2019s a great example of how to teach responsible behaviour, and money management.", "NTA - it wouldn\u2019t be fair to her sister if you just bought the non-saving sister the same things when she didn\u2019t have to save for them.", "You are doing a good job. Better for your kids learning it now when there r room for mistakes than when they r an adult.", "NTA. The point of an allowance, generally, is to teach kids how to manage money.

Get a little lock box so she can deposit $5 a week in there or something.", "No, you're not a jerk.  You're teaching 'Emma' that if she blows her money on frivolous things then she won't be able to afford nicer things.  That is a VERY valuable life lesson.  Your partner is a fool if she thinks that simply handing Emma expensive things after she's blown her own money on useless junk is the way to go.  Stick to your guns.  You're doing a great job of parenting!", "NTA. Maybe you can help the youngest learn how to save? Four example, agree with her that she'll get half in cash and half in a bank account. Teaching her good money habits is important.", "NTA. You are teaching her a valuable lesson that she will NEED in just a few short years when she starts paying for all of her own stuff. The fact that she is struggling with the concept of saving money for something she really wants proves she needs to be taught this. The fact that she just expects someone else to buy it for her is troubling and is a very bad habit for her to start.

If she doesn't learn how to manage money she might not be capable of living on her own as an adult.", "NTA. Emma needs to learn the same life lesson as the rest of us: you can't always get what you want. Not to mention buying her the lamp would discourage Abby from keep on saving money.", "NTA hopefully she will learn to think before spending all her money on a whim, my nephew is the same, he cant save money, he always has plans to save up for nice things he wants but ends up blowing any money in his pocket on junk", " Maybe sit down with her and do a budget. If she wants the lamp, let her know how much she has to say and when she has saved enough she can buy it. It is up to her. \n\nWhat you did is exactly what you should\u2019ve done. They both have equal opportunities and that needs to be pointed out to her. It\u2019s hard for young kids to budget. But as long as her sister is using her own money she needs to understand that.

Gone through that the lamp costs $50 so that's 5 weeks allowance, and can she think of what she did with her last 5 weeks allowance, oh she doesn't even remember what random junk she bought, well maybe she wants to save up for 5 weeks to get the lamp? Then in like 3 weeks, oh, are you sure you want to get that dumb thing, or would you prefer to wait 2 more weeks and get LAMP?", "NTA - This is just the way kids learn - and it's painful sometimes, but it's the only way they CAN learn.\n\nI had one child, my youngest (of 4) daughters, who was absolutely astonishing at \"delayed gratification\" - I caught her cutting her desserts in half and putting half in the fridge for later and asked her why and she told me straight up, \"I want to save some for later.\"\n\nShe was six.\n\nUnderstanding that what you have is limited and you might want to reserve some for another time or another need is an important step towards responsible adulthood (many adults haven't mastered it, to be frank).\n\nI was never more proud as a parent than when I saw her doing this and explained both my approval and the importance of it to her.\n\nThe same pattern, by the way, followed with virtually everything in her life. Money, battery usage on devices, basically anything that could be split into \"use now or save for later\" this was done with.\n\nOf my five kids, I fully expect her to be the one to retire well.", "NTA. It's a valuable lesson to learn to save up money, one I learned much too late in life (as in I am in my 30's and only learned to save my money within the last 2 or 3 years.)

I know grown ass adults with their own children who cannot seem to understand that saving money is important, and then they get all shocked pikachu when something unexpected happens and they are desperately trying to borrow money for bills and other expenses because they consistently live outside their means because they cannot handle delayed gratification.\n\nAt this age, their sister has nicer things.  In 20 years, it might mean getting evicted for being late on rent too many times.  Now is the time for your youngest to learn that lesson unless you and your partner want to be bailing her out for the rest of your lives", "NTA this is a good lesson.

I'm grateful to them for teaching us this gentle way.", "NTA\n\nIt is the correct way to handle these things.\n\nMy sister saves, I splurge.

He was huffing and puffing because I initially said no, that those items are too expensive and we wouldn't be able to buy everything he needs clothes-wise for new school year that way. It makes no sense to buy expensive clothes for a growing teenager who will outgrow them in matter of months. But oh boy, was the boy determined.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n So I gave him and my daughter the same amount of money and let them buy whatever clothes they want with it.

So I let him sweat and be embarrased for 2 weeks, and then we went and bought some more clothes because he really needed them. No need to mention none were expensive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext time there was need for new clothes for him, he just went for things he liked that didn't break the bank and it was all well.

Learning to manage money is a very important life skill. This would only be unfair if she were getting a different amount of money.", "Nta you explained. You can offer ways for the other to save. Your partner getting an attitude makes no sense. Teach her how to save so she can get the nice things she wants.

She needs to learn how finances really work in real life.", "NTA but maybe help her set goals and budget.\n12 year olds don't have financial goals and therefore saving is an abstract concept that holds no real meaning.\nUse this experience to teach her.

Do they not understand how this all works??", "NTA.\n\nThis is an excellent (and necessary) lesson. It may take your youngest longer to really *get* it, because every kid is different, but that doesn\u2019t mean you stop teaching it. The stakes are appropriately low, the consequences of failure are minimal, and she\u2019s got a new opportunity every week to correct the previous week\u2019s mistakes. She could not be more set up for success.

This can be a hard lesson for some, but it is a lesson that everyone needs to learn. \n\nMaybe if you do a savings chart for her, that might help her remember to save. Like have a jar drawn on a paper, get some star stickers, each star can be $5, if she puts $5 in savings she adds a star. If she takes money out she removes one. It could say how many stars she needs in it to buy her goal purchase. Sometimes visual things can help people remember the bigger picture vs instant gratification.", "Nta", "NTA. Does your partner not understand what the job of a parent is? It's to prepare a child for the real world. You're supposed to teach them life skills and good habits so that when they become adults they can make their way in the world successfully. \n\nEmma is 14, so she's either a freshman in highschool or about to be. When the heck did your partner intend to teach her financial responsibility? When she was off to college and blew her food budget on randomness and ended up going hungry? Or did they intend to just keep fixing it for Emma so she never learns how to spend and save properly? Because that leads to a lifetime of credit card debt, loan debt, spending addiction and the inability to get a house or take care of one's self. \n\nAnd then what happens if she never learns this and you guys pass away? Because I've seen what happens to adults who were never taught life skills as kids and their parents always rescued them from their bad decisions, the parents pass away and then these adult children spend the rest of their lives struggling and mooching off others. \n\nYeah I'm talking extremes, but this is where it starts. It seems like such a little thing right now but every lesson, good or bad, taught in childhood ripples out and has profound impacts in adulthood, especially when it becomes a pattern of behavior. Where your teen hasn't learned this important life skill and your partner wants to keep coddling her and rescuing her from her own bad decisions instead of teaching her. It will make her dependent on others to save her from herself and she won't think twice about the consequences of her spending habits. \n\nHonestly I'd sit Emma down and teach her how to make a budget and set goals to save for. Give the girls opportunities to earn extra money so Emma has the opportunity to put in work and see the fruits of her labor.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Let\u2019s call them Emma and Abby. Both girls gets 10 dollars a week to use for what ever they want. Now Abby has learned to save, instead of buying whatever she wants she will save up and get nicer things. She just got a lamp that throws stars on the ceiling.\n\nEmma doesn\u2019t save she will buy really cheap things that just kinda break after a bit. I have explained this so many times to her but she wasn\u2019t getting it so I am letting her learn it by experience.\n\nBack to the lamp, Emma saw it and was really upset she didn\u2019t have one. This turned into her being upset that her sister has nicer stuff. I sat her down and explained that she was able to buy the nice stuff since she saved her money for it. She asks if I could get it for her and I told her no since she will need to save up for it.\n\nShe has been pouting at day but when I explained the situation to my partner they were pissed. We got in a huge argument and they think I am huge jerk for telling her all this.\n\nI need an outside opinion.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If I mowed the lawn for my Uncle or shoveled snow he paid me. \n\nMy Mom kept a notebook for each sibling and she kept a lockbox with each of our names on an envelope inside.

The point is to be *responsible* and *earn* what you are wanting to save for. Not having Mommy take it away and save it for her.

She saved and spent her savings on the lamp but her sister can pay only half of it because mom is paying the other half? Not really fair.\n\n(Edit: don't mind that I misread it lmao sorry!)\n\nI agree with the rest tho.

Some parents encourage kids to put a third (or a quarter, if there are four sections) of their money into each, and others leave it up to the kids.\n\nHaving a visual representation of how much they\u2019re saving vs spending (and other things) helps some kids.

I opened a checking and savings for them. They are required to put 10% of any money they receive into savings. I do a bank transfer and split the money. I explained they need to get into the habit of 10% so when they start receiving an actual paycheck they will already be in the habit. I told them they should work towards the goal of having several months pay in savings in case of an emergency. This works really well for them. I have one that is the spender and one that is the saver. They both saved enough to get a really expensive item when we go on vacation. It has worked really well.

Being able to see the money is both a blessing and a curse, and she needs to learn to balance it. It\u2019s nice to be able to physically SEE the money you have (the same as a digital number in an online bank account statement). However, that also means when the number is high enough, she will need to learn restraint on just blowing it all at once. \n^^     \u2022 the child should be the one doing this. OP, you were spot on in your comment about if you set it aside for her, that defeats the purpose. She needs to be the one to decide where that money goes, so that she learns how to responsibly manage it. It might take awhile, but after enough instances like this lamp situation, she\u2019ll get there.", "Haha no worries \u270c in the end, we agree OP is doing it right :D"]}
