He was well spoken but visibly drunk, and i sat in the car while my boyfriend had a cigarette outside with him. he was out there a while and i went to join the conversation when my boyfriend said to him do you need me to drop you somewhere? the man said yes and got in the car. i don\u2019t really like strangers and i\u2019m very wary of men but i figured dropping him off somewhere would take ten minutes so i would just sit quietly and deal with it, even though i was anxious. we then got to the road the man wanted dropped off on, and they sat in the car for a cigarette and to finish the conversation, when my boyfriend says he\u2019s dropping me home and if he wanted to come for the drive. i looked at him and shook my head clearly saying no and he just ignored me and started driving. \n\ni was furious and anxious and was having a panic attack in the car and shaking, and my boyfriend saw this and ignored me. he pointed at my phone for me to check my texts and he said that i needed to calm down and that he\u2019s working on something. i had no idea what he was doing, all i know is that there was a strange drunk man sat in the back of the car. i was silent the whole hour and half we were all in the car together, only interjecting to say please drop me off here i want to get an uber and for him to say no. i got out at my house where my bf said he\u2019d walk me to my door. he left the man at the car and asked me i was okay, to which i said no i can\u2019t believe you put me in this position and you\u2019ve never upset me this much. i went into my house and waited for him to check up on my or apologise but he didn\u2019t call for three hours.\n\nwhen he did finally call me back, i told him how angry i was that he didn\u2019t listen to me and how he\u2019d blatantly ignored me and he said that i was ungrateful for getting a ride home and it was horrible of me to not trust his judgement of the situation and that he had a gut feeling that he followed (the man payed him when he finally dropped him home and it was a decent amount) of course i didn\u2019t know that this would be the outcome, but my boyfriend flipped it on me and said i was selfish and only thought of myself at all times. he then proceeded to say i don\u2019t do anything nice for him and how he felt alone in our relationship and i ended up apologising and crying. i\u2019m now thinking i overreacted and made him feel bad for no reason because nothing bad happened and i let my anxiety get the best of me, but i also feel as though my anger was justified because he forced me into a situation i was uncomfortable with.

I can only speak as a young woman myself but that\u2019s terrifying, and reading this gave me chills because I could only think about just how wrong this could\u2019ve gone. Crazy that he did all this just because he had a gut feeling he\u2019d be paid instead of considering the safety & well-being of you both. My only word of advice is to end the relationship. It doesn\u2019t sound healthy or safe for you.", "NTA, event aside, he is making you feel guilty for being anxious in a reasonable situation. He turned things around and made you apologize for being upset while he ignored your obvious concerns. He then accused you for being a bad partner and never do anything for him.

I wonder if he even did take his keys with him as he walked OP to the door... \n\nBut to give a fuck just because he had a gut feeling he could get money... He is one of those guys who risk their existence because they get a totally save investment tip *wink wink*", "And he wouldn't let her out of the car when she wanted to call an Uber!!! OP ditch this guy. I think he is the man you really need to worry about.", "If he has keys to your place, change the locks before you dump him.  I hate to think whom he might sell his keys to.", "This is literally the only explanation that makes any sense.", "\u201cThis anxiety?\u201d It\u2019s called being a woman who doesn\u2019t want to get raped or murdered.", "can you elaborate?", "He didn't want to drop the guy off first because the guy offered him drugs so he wanted to dump OP and go partying at the guy's house.\n\nOr something.", "NTA OP\n\nI don\u2019t honestly understand how he thinks letting a drunk stranger in his car was okay for the safety of someone he cares about (jury\u2019s out on this end if the person he cares about is himself or OP)\n\nI personally don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever leave my safety in getting home (especially late at night) in his hands ever again - trust is easily broken but hard fought but it\u2019s ultimately up to you how this whole experience has left you feeling\n\nAlso I don\u2019t want to comment on your relationship but if after all this stress I wanted to remove myself from the situation I was uncomfortable with i.e. get out the damn car - when it was clear that was the only solution for my safety as your bf in this case was going to do whatever he wanted - and he said NO then whooo boy would I never ever let him have sway over my safety again\n\nALSO just a final thing the fact that he drove to your house with this stranger in the car so the stranger -if they sobered up etc enough to remember  - knew where you lived just makes me stressed thinking about it \n\nSome people may have been fine with all this but your post makes it clear to me that this has understandably shaken you and it\u2019s now up to you to decide if you feel safe with him", ">..I was reading this and like am I being ridiculous or does this sound like a set up? Like did the bf sell OP to this man in some way? Maybe I've just watched too much TV but the way he acted is just so strange to me...\n\nWell if you've watched too much TV then so have I because that's exactly where my mind went lmao. \n\nbut the thing is, if you're a woman these are the things most of us HAVE to think about, because if we don't, then when something bad happens, well, its \"our fault\" isn't it (please read that with dripping sarcasm)", "He pretty much kidnapped her.  If someone asks to get out of your car and you literally don't let them, that's illegal.", "Forgive me but your boyfriend's \"gut feeling\" claim sounds like bullshit. Would love to know what was really going on there.", "I'm sorry to suggest this but the whole thing just seems so sus as to be ridiculous. Could your bf be doing paid sex work?", "Right? The whole thing stinks to high heaven. \n\nBf dealing drugs?", "it\u2019s somewhere in this thread but i did reply to a comment like this before, this is highly unlikely", "It's not even really a panic attack.  She had a situationally appropriate reaction of panic to being put in a stupidly dangerous situation by her partner and then literally being trapped in that situation.", "That's what I'm guessing. He made an unexpected \"connection.\" \n\nDump this asshole immediately. If your boyfriend were an Uber driver and refused to let you out you'd be calling the police. I know I would. Your \"boyfriend\" can't even treat you as well as a paid stranger would. And there was a cash exchange he wouldn't tell you about. What?? You gonna live the rest of your days having panic attacks with your boyfriend playing Uber driver for strange drunk men?\n\nHelllllll no!", "I sincerely hope you're right.", "Could he be dealing drugs? That would explain the money and wanting to drop you off first - he found an unexpected customer. \n\nI think you have to be honest with yourself that whatever the reason was, asking a drunk and upset man for business advice probably wasn't it. \n\nHis response to you raising an issue of concern is manipulative and designed to sit on your discomfort instead of working on issues together. Regardless of why he made the choices he did, I really think you should think about what you're getting out of this relationship and whether you feel respected as an equal voice.", "OP, stop second-guessing yourself. 99% of the commenters are saying NTA and ditch this man. They're right.", "it really does not add up. if he was doing sex work it surely wouldn\u2019t be on some random man we met at a shop out of sheer coincidence? i\u2019m pretty sure he was in it because he thought he could make some money by giving the guy a lift and having a conversation with him but my bf really really is not the kind of individual to do that, plus i\u2019ve seen no evidence of any sort of nefarious activity throughout our relationship. it is a weird situation for sure, but it seems like a reach to sum it up as that kind of thing because it seemed completely opportunistic that this whole thing happened", "it doesn\u2019t make sense to be the drugs thing because surely he would have just wanted me to get out and get an uber so he could get back to his deal or stash or whatever? there\u2019s no way he had drugs in the car with him and if that was the case it would have been handled swiftly and the guy would have left?", "NTA\n\nYour BF waa frankly being idiotic and risking your safety. Do NOT trust this man further.", "Stranger danger NTA", "NTA - also you didn\u2019t really ask or want a ride home at the point when you asked to be let out so you can get yourself an Uber back, you were being kidnapped at that point", "NTA\n\nSo how much money did your bf make showing a potentially dangerous drunk stranger exactly where you live & how to get there? What other info about you did he provide the man in the rest of their ride?", "NTA\n\nSo how much money did your bf make showing a potentially dangerous drunk stranger exactly where you live & how to get there?

People get murdered much easier than that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou don't need to be with the BF", "INFO: did you know it\u2019s spelled \u201cex-boyfriend\u201d and not boyfriend?\n\nHe put you endanger. He refused to let you leave his car when you were clearly uncomfortable. That\u2019s entrapment and it\u2019s against the law. You break up with him.", "NTA. He allowed a drunk stranger to see where you live? Run, girl. His judgment is so poor that he is a danger to you.", "Your bf acted badly, and now is blaming you for calling him out on it. Your reaction was entirely valid. I'm especiall concerned that he wouldn't let you out to get an Uber. That behaviour is scary. \n\nNTA. Please reconsider this relationship", "NTA. What are you supposed to be grateful for? That your boyfriend knew you were scared and panicking but ignored you? That he refused to let you out of the car and forced you to spend all that time with a drunk stranger? You did not overreact. Your boyfriend is a selfish, cruel asshole. This kind of thing will keep happening in the future if you stay with him.", "NTA. Your concerns were valid.idk what your relationship looks like overall but I also don't like how he turned things around on you, making you feel like you're doing something wrong and ending with you as the one apologizing", "NTA this drunk stranger now *knows where you live* because of your boyfriend", "\u201cMen are afraid women will laugh at them. Women are afraid men will kill them.\u201d", "Yes something similarly shady if not this exactly.", "I am indeed a woman so I know the struggle all too well", "Sounds more like indigestion than \"gut feeling\"", "and you have no idea why women would be afraid of strange men? welcome to your first day on earth.", "I think you overreacted. I also think he overreacted to your feelings in a way that\u2019s much worse. I agree with the other posters saying you should break up with this guy, but not for the first thing he did, but the second.", "She said it was a panic attack, not me.", "Sure, but by dropping you off first it would have meant that he could go wherever he needed to go to get whatever he needed to get. You said you didn't hear from him for 3 hours - that's a long time to just drop someone off unless they were making a detour somewhere...", "Things don\u2019t add up. He is definitely gaslighting you, and  make you doubt your guts feelings. \n\nThe fact that he didn\u2019t let you remove yourself from a situation you weren\u2019t confortable with, is concerning. Physically holding you against your will, have a name. And it isn\u2019t partnership. \n\nHim refusing to let you go, while picking up a random drunk, hopping to get money for a lift or business advices? Really? He had a hunch a random drunk will be the wiser for business advice or could be easily coerced into giving enough money to be worth your inconfort? How much was enough for him to knowingly put you through a distressing situation?\n\nIf he sold something I wouldn\u2019t jump on him selling his body. As from what you write, drugs will be first. I got a bad feeling he would rob before a manly sexy time. Which would be wrong with someone unable to fully consent. \nHowever from the timeline, I would be more worried for the safety and well-being of the drunk man. \n\nTruth is your (hope soon to be ex) bf behaviour is really concerning. More than an hunch he is dishonest. \n\nForcing you to be in an enclosed space with a drunk stranger. \nNOT OKAY.\n\nRefusing to let you go. NOT OKAY. \n\nBringing a stranger almost at your doorstep after he acknowledged you didn\u2019t wanted. NOT OKAY. \n\nClaiming he need to help a drunk, then that he had the hunch he could win financial gain from him. UNSETTLING if not predatory. It wasn\u2019t to help. He told the truth when saying he thought he could get something worth it out of a drunk guy. Worth it for him only btw. This wasn\u2019t a good deed to start. \nDoes he volunteer himself often to give hands out or more prompt to con?\n\nDisappearing for hours, to be back claiming to have been payed? SUSPICIOUS! \n\nOverall a long rant to validate from what you write there is discrepancies between his story telling and facts. Enough to rise red flags. Concerning enough to not feel safe.", "i agree that the three hours thing was a tad weird.. i\u2019m not sure where he would have gone that\u2019s that bad though i do have his phone login and i\u2019ve never seen anything remotely like that and he\u2019s not secretive about things which makes this whole thing more stressful because it\u2019s not really in his character.. also it makes no sense to have dropped me first because where i live is a forty minute drive from where he lives and all of his friends are so if i\u2019d gotten an uber it would have saved him driving to mine and back to his area"]}
