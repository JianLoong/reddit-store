{"id": 20170, "submission_id": "14ed4cb", "title": "AITA for not wanting to sit in the car with a drunk stranger", "selftext": " last night me (f20) and my partner (m25) went for a night out and on the way home we stopped at the shop to grab a drink for the drive. there he sees two men shouting at each other. One of them walked off; and while he was paying he asked the other man if he was okay. He was well spoken but visibly drunk, and i sat in the car while my boyfriend had a cigarette outside with him. he was out there a while and i went to join the conversation when my boyfriend said to him do you need me to drop you somewhere? the man said yes and got in the car. i don\u2019t really like strangers and i\u2019m very wary of men but i figured dropping him off somewhere would take ten minutes so i would just sit quietly and deal with it, even though i was anxious. we then got to the road the man wanted dropped off on, and they sat in the car for a cigarette and to finish the conversation, when my boyfriend says he\u2019s dropping me home and if he wanted to come for the drive. i looked at him and shook my head clearly saying no and he just ignored me and started driving. \n\ni was furious and anxious and was having a panic attack in the car and shaking, and my boyfriend saw this and ignored me. he pointed at my phone for me to check my texts and he said that i needed to calm down and that he\u2019s working on something. i had no idea what he was doing, all i know is that there was a strange drunk man sat in the back of the car. i was silent the whole hour and half we were all in the car together, only interjecting to say please drop me off here i want to get an uber and for him to say no. i got out at my house where my bf said he\u2019d walk me to my door. he left the man at the car and asked me i was okay, to which i said no i can\u2019t believe you put me in this position and you\u2019ve never upset me this much. i went into my house and waited for him to check up on my or apologise but he didn\u2019t call for three hours.\n\nwhen he did finally call me back, i told him how angry i was that he didn\u2019t listen to me and how he\u2019d blatantly ignored me and he said that i was ungrateful for getting a ride home and it was horrible of me to not trust his judgement of the situation and that he had a gut feeling that he followed (the man payed him when he finally dropped him home and it was a decent amount) of course i didn\u2019t know that this would be the outcome, but my boyfriend flipped it on me and said i was selfish and only thought of myself at all times. he then proceeded to say i don\u2019t do anything nice for him and how he felt alone in our relationship and i ended up apologising and crying. i\u2019m now thinking i overreacted and made him feel bad for no reason because nothing bad happened and i let my anxiety get the best of me, but i also feel as though my anger was justified because he forced me into a situation i was uncomfortable with.

Especially strange to me that he\u2019d let this random stranger come along while he dropped you off at your home, despite your protests, pretty much just showing this dude exactly where you lived. I can only speak as a young woman myself but that\u2019s terrifying, and reading this gave me chills because I could only think about just how wrong this could\u2019ve gone. Crazy that he did all this just because he had a gut feeling he\u2019d be paid instead of considering the safety & well-being of you both. My only word of advice is to end the relationship. It doesn\u2019t sound healthy or safe for you.", "NTA, event aside, he is making you feel guilty for being anxious in a reasonable situation. He turned things around and made you apologize for being upset while he ignored your obvious concerns. He then accused you for being a bad partner and never do anything for him. I am pretty sure this is like textbook gaslighting. Fuck this guy. I've been in a relationship with someone who makes everything your fault and can never accept any fault on their own. Get out of this. \n\nAlso, what he was \"trying to do\" was get some money out of this guy? That's why he spent a few hours driving him around all night? Don't be with this man.", ">last night me (f20) and my partner (m25) went for a night out\n\n>he said that i was ungrateful for getting a ride home\n\nSo the two of you went out together and you're supposed to be *grateful* that he gave you a lift home afterwards?\n\nNTA.\n\nMy guess is that he acted on impulse, offering this guy a lift, and then didn't want to admit that it was a stupid idea, so he's making you look unreasonable instead. The fact that no harm came to either of you *doesn't* make it a safe or sensible thing to do. \n\nI hope this isn't how he usually behaves.", "So now this random drunken angry guy knows where you live for the low low price of whatever he paid for the ride", "Uhhh WHAT?!?! NTA and I hope he\u2019s your ex bf now. He purposely showed a strange man exactly where you live?? Oh hell no. You need to nope all the way out of any relationship with someone who so completely disregards your safety and comfort for a complete stranger who was also drunk. YOU should have been the priority but you weren\u2019t.", "And now this strange man know where you, a single woman lives.That is a total lack of respect for your safety and autonomy (not letting you find your own way home).\n\nNTA", "NTA. I wonder what your bf wanted with this man. This is weird. He could have called him an Uber.", "NTA - he just showed a drunk stranger where you live. This could have ended tragically, I\u2019m glad it did not. It\u2019s clear this person takes needless risks and will not consider your council", "NTA. You did not like the situation, so you tried to remove yourself from it by wanting to continue by Uber. Your boyfriend shows no regard to your feelings and needs, which is worrysome. \n\nI would recommend though that you try to work on your anxiety around strangers, as both life and strangers happen.

Something nobody is talking about here . Obviously you like your bf because you apologized to him . So he couldn\u2019t have forced you right ? Why not just get out before he drives and call an Uber or someone to pick you up ?

Leave him, hope the tip from a drunk stranger was worth it for him.", "think this is a bit dramatic mate u can\u2019t tell someone\u2019s an abuser from one situation", "I think the idea was that he looked relatively wealthy and maybe he could give business advice or something along those lines.. my boyfriend said he had a gut feeling it was a good idea and i should have trusted this but i just felt anxious", "I don\u2019t think anything nefarious of that nature occurred, the guy was a lot older than us and i think my boyfriend saw it as an opportunity of some sorts? for business advice like i just replied to someone else or maybe just for money.. like i said he did pay him a very decent amount so the man was wealthy but i didn\u2019t know this at the time, he was just a stranger to us both", "like i said in the post i didn\u2019t think it would be too bad to drop the man home. it was the long drive to my house i had an issue with, and he didn\u2019t give me the option to get out of the car i did ask multiple times and he told me to stop being stupid and just let him drive me- i physically didn\u2019t have the option to get out by the point i realised it was going to be an extended drive", "Look, it is just one situation and I don't know them personally, so that's fair. But the fact that she is very upset, and reasonably so, and when she confronted him about it, he spun things around to where she's apologizing. He also brought up \"you never do anything nice for me\" when she was upset about the hour and a half he made her spend in the car with a drunk stranger they met while he was yelling at someone else. The guy might not be abusive per se, but he definitely gets defensive to an extreme level and cares more about winning an argument than resolving an issue.", ">u can\u2019t tell someone\u2019s an abuser from one situation\n\nso by that logic you also can't tell someone's a good person from one situation either. thus making it logical you don't want a random drunk guy in a small enclosed space with you and also *knowing where you live*.", "You\u2019re boyfriend, I mean \u201cpartner\u201d, is an idiot.", ">like i said he did pay him a very decent amount\n\nno, like your boyfriend told you. and it's still irrelevant - if your boyfriend wants to play taxi, he can do that for a side gig where he alone can consent to it rather than REFUSE TO LET YOU LEAVE THE CAR.", "I understand now , I think I was a bit confused on why you would still be with a guy who basically kidnapped you so I assumed you could have left if you wanted to .
