Your dad and his gf/sugar baby are both grown adults capable of making their own decisions, but I can definitely see why your dad dating someone the same age as you would be hella weird, and he really should acknowledge how that would make you feel uncomfortable.\n\nAt the end of the day it\u2019s your wedding and you can invite whoever you want, but you should be prepared for this to affect your relationship with your dad.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
