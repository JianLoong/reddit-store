Your step dad is not an affair partner. \n\nAs for your father, he is an adult and he can live as he wants but this is your wedding. He probably wants to bring his sugar baby to the wedding to show your mother he can find a young and attractive woman. I can't think of any other reason why a successful man like him would be in this kind of relationship when he can have a non-transactional one. I understand he went through hell but he will probably go through another one with Sarah. I hope he finds a life partner and heals. \n\nI don't blame your in laws. It will look ridiculous and introducing Sarah as your father's partner will be awkward. People will think Sarah is his niece or one of your friends as she's your peer. \n\nIt's your wedding so do as you want. It seems like you don't have a close relationship with your dad anyway. I hope you enjoy your wedding.", "NTA. It\u2019s your right to say who comes to your wedding, but I hope your dad moves on from such a despicable family.", "NTA", "Have you had loads of therapy because after your childhood I\u2019d definitely be doing a lot of work on myself before getting married at 23 years old. What stuck out to me was the \u2018my mum didn\u2019t let him see me.\u2019 And he just accepted that? He didn\u2019t get a court order for visitation? Also he\u2019s only been with this person a few months, she\u2019s probably not going to be around by next summer so stop stressing about it. Sounds like your parents are both pretty terrible people so again therapy to make sure you\u2019ve unpacked all the stuff you\u2019ve picked up from them and what do you want to get married at such a young age for anyway?", "NTA even if it wasn't a gross age gap (I don't care that she's young, I care that she's his child's age) it just isn't appropriate to bring your partner of a few months to a wedding. He can't compare your mother's marriage to his girlfriend of a couple of months. It isn't the same at all. I wouldn't be inviting her to my wedding until they had been together for at least 2 years so that the wedding photos aren't full of dad's random gold digger of the moment", "NTA. Sounds like your dad may still have issues from being cheated on by his wife and brother. I was cheated on, but if the other person had been my sister, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be the same person I am today. And your mom kept you away from him even tho she was the one at fault. It\u2019s your wedding so you can\u2019t invite who you want, but I feel for the old man.", "NTA...your wedding, your rules.\n\nIt sounds like you have some seriously toxic family.  Dont br afraid to maintain bounderies.  I wouldnt put it past your dad to show up with her anyway.  Better have a contingency plan to deal with the drama.\n\nAs to your Mom....dont get me started.  She has no place to talk about disgusting relationships.  Good god.", "NTA. I really fail to see your Dad's point of view in this. Sarah is actually not apart of the family.  They are not married. It doesn't sound like they even have any plans to get married. You are absolutely not obligated to invite someone you barely know who makes you and others uncomfortable. It's your big day. Labels and lifestyle aside, you never said who he can or cannot date etc,  you are simply saying she is not invited to your wedding. The focus should be on you and your fiance.", "ESH\nIt's your wedding and he's not financially contributing. So it is your decision. The age difference is big and you and his gf are basically the same age. That's kind of creepy.\n\nOn the other hand your dad was cheated on and betrayed by his wife and brother. Furthermore he wasn't allowed to have contact with you for most of your life. He's been a victim of your mother schemes, but he pulled through improved his life and managed to find someone who makes him happy.\n\nIt doesn't really matter what relationship he has with Sarah, he deserves some happiness too. Your in laws are widely inappropriate and it shouldn't matter what they say. It's not their call to decide whether Sarah comes or not and I don't understand why they're freaking over her presence. They wouldn't have to interact with her.", "With age comes wisdon supposedly. You may not think YTA now but 10-20 years from you will look back and know you were. Let your dad have his happiness please. Every one is talking about the age difference. Has it actually been mentioned? It could be 15-40 years.", "First your dad was victimized by your mother, and now he is being victimized by you.  While it is your choice to determine who attends your wedding, it seems to me that you are just as crappy an individual as your mother.\n\nYTA", "Grow up.", "I'm not particularly close with either of my parents tbh.", "This! If dad is happy and not being conned, he can do whatever he wants. As does Sarah. You don't have to invite her, but how will her coming impact the wedding? Unless you have a wedding with only 10 people, it really doesn't matter that much. I would tell her she can't be in the family pictures but enjoy herself for the rest of the wedding. It seems like dad had a hard deal in life - wife cheating with his brother, not seeing his child - so if Sarah makes him happy: good for both of them!", "I wonder if the Dad thinks his gf would still be with him if he were poor or he didn\u2019t pay for everything?\n\nHe might just be delusional\u2026", "Is she even a sugar baby? All the sugar babies I\u2019ve known always made it clear what type of relationship it was. If the dad truly believes it\u2019s a regular relationship she\u2019s just a gold digger.", "Yeah, the in laws desperately need to butt out and stay in their own lane.", "Basically Dad married for love, got his heart ripped out, lost his brother and a child. Now at least he gets what he pays for but is judged instead of his ex that screwed his brother. Question is did Mom ever get a DNA test to find out which brother actually fathered OP? Doubt it, law says the husband is the father so she went with that. Maybe get one for Christmas OP. \n\nYTA", "OP isn't dictating who he dates. Just who is allowed at **OP's** wedding. Also you're conveniently ignoring that dad's a total creep", "I agree. Hes just trying to find his happiness. If he choses to do it with shallow younger girls thats his choice just like it was ops moms choice to be a homewrecker, keep his daughter away from him willingly and make him look like a bad man when obviously hes going through something. The man just wants companionship. It gets harder for men with age. OP should understand that.", "She is still a year older than her so it's weird", "She will never be OP:s \u201cstep mom\u201d as she won\u2019t have any responsibilities as a mom. She will however be her dads wife.", "hey man they banned r/incel a while back you\u2019re gonna wanna take that bullshit over to 4chan.", "Any able bodied person of any gender who quits their job and stops contributing to their share of the bills without at least discussing it with their spouse first deserves to get left.", "found the incel lmao", "We cannot know especifically about OP's dad, but definitely there are guys that are so delusional.", "and i wonder if the girl thinks OPs dad would be with her if she wasnt young and pretty.  a tale as old as time", "I think kitchen has a fair point. You're not the total AH, it is your wedding so invite who you want but it is an AH move to deny your father his happiness. Mom ruined their relationship then goes and gets a new husband and everything is hunky dory. But dad may be struggling or maybe hes not ready for commitment. I mean his wife cheated on him with his brother. Thats pretty heavy. Now your sending the message that whatever he has with that women is disgusting and you get to dictate whats ok and whats not. Let the man live. I say let her go just seat parents away from one another and tell girly to behave herself and dont cause a scene or dont invite dad and his girl at all. \n\nI feel for your father. He didnt ask for this. Feels like everyone is against his happiness and its not even his fault. Throw him a bone.", "Are you prepared for your relationship with your father to be hurt though. You can deny her coming sure but it\u2019s going to hurt your relationship with your Dad is it worth it.\n\nYour Dad has had a lot of trauma from what happen. He did not  up and leave his marriage for a 25 year old \n\nSarah is 25 she is not a child. There are people who do make sure age gaps work\n\nThe only thing you will do is here is alienate your Dad", "How is it my fault that my mom had an affair I was 4 bro", "hmmm.  \"The man just wants companionship\".  He wants a trophy to show his friends (like you) and pretend that she loves him for himself.   LMAO!", "Your in laws should have no say in your invitations, unless there was some legal issue.", "Excellent!", "This cracked me up. Thank you for the early morning laugh!", "And the mother kept the children away from him. Imagine what an awful time that was for him.", "Well said!", "Its not really that strange that people are \"against his happiness\" when he more or less wants to bring a sex worker to his daughters wedding", "Firstly, my relationship with my dad has never been close or good.\n\nSecondly, it is definitely not an innocent romantic relationship with an age gap. Sarah is 100% a gold digger or sugar baby or whatever you want to call it. They met on a sugar baby website but my dad insists she's his girlfriend.", "Is your dad contributing anything to the wedding", "It seems like you should get a better wife because all women are not like that. I\u2019ve had partners who\u2019ve lost their jobs and they didn\u2019t get dumped because of that. In relationships sometimes its 50/50, sometimes its 70/30, its even 100/0 sometimes but every woman is not like this.", "That's gonna be a yikes from me dude, you both sound terrible, her for apparently just seeing you as an atm and you for just that terrible take in general", "No.", "The father may have difficulty trusting women after what her mother did and may be going for  obvious gold diggers to protect his heart.", "If it was the same financial and sexual exchange then I'd have the same stance. OP is allowed to not want her dad's prostitute at her wedding.", "I'm not sure how it works where op is from, but I know in my country Sarah would probably be in a position to claim dependency and continue to receive money of OPs father even after the relationship dissolves."]}
