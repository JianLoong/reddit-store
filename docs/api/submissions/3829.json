Unless there is a good reason why your mom kept you from him, or your dad actively didn\u2019t want to see you, your mom is the biggest asshole in this scenario. She psychologically broke your dad by fucking his brother, then broke him even more by keeping his kid from him.\n\nFor your dad, he\u2019s an asshole for not respecting your wishes. It\u2019s your wedding. There are two reasons he would be so insistent on bringing the \u201cgirlfriend.\u201d One is because he is a delusional asshole and thinks she loves him and it is a real relationship.

If you don\u2019t invite the GF, your relationship with your dad will be all but over. If you do, it will most definitely be a shit show.\n\nI guess the thing I\u2019d recommend you keep in mind is this: your relationship with your dad was held up by a rope. Your mom has spent years sawing that rope down to a single thread. Not inviting the GF would snap that thread. *None of that is your fault.* Just keep in mind who it was that spent years wearing down that rope, and don\u2019t entirely blame your dad.

But given that's he's currently lying to himself about how it might have started as sex work but now it's a real relationship, I might argue that, at best, it's an unhealthy coping mechanism.

To make it sound a bit better let's say \"reciprocal\"... but make no mistake, the idea of some pure altruistic soul-mate love isn't real. Now if you want to talk about 'possibilities', ok sure, we can dream, but when we get back to probabilities the reality kicks in. \n\nWe can pretend we aren't animals if you want, but living in fantasy land has worse outcomes than living in reality even if the former seems less painful.\n\nNow, don't go all thinking I'm talking about some extreme here. Prostitution is probably the most extreme and obvious example of a purely transactional transactional 'relationship' but even in prostitution I'm pretty sure there have been men where she 'noped' the fuck out of there. \n\nWe can be compatible with people, we can be attracted, we can have emotional connections, we can have similar morals and values, but make no mistake there are a couple 'deal breakers' (or at least one) even if you're not aware of what they are until it's too late. Maybe it's money, maybe it's sex, maybe it's status, maybe it's just freaking survival...

But dad showing up with a younger hotter woman - that cannot be allowed. \n\nThey think it's disgusting? How about mom banging dad's brother? Where's the shame? Oh lemme guess \"That was a long time ago\"... yeah whatever, mom's pissed of he did better than she did, he got someone better than her. They don't want him \"showing her up\".  Plain and simple.

Relationships are reciprocal because people do things to benefit the other, thus gaining together. They don\u2019t do something to achieve a debtor/creditor scenario. \n\nBriffault\u2019s Law reduces relations to reproductive only. I think it\u2019s safe to assume the father isn\u2019t tracking his gf\u2019s cycle in an attempt to pregnant her and only fucking her when she\u2019s ovulating, so it\u2019s irrelevant. Equally, non-heterosexual relationships and child free couples completely disprove reproduction as a foundation of a human relationship. Briffault\u2019s Law relies on seeing women as incubators, and only incubators. Unsurprising for someone born in the 1800s, but times have changed drastically since then. \n\nBriffault\u2019s Law is specific to romantic relationships. Completely irrelevant to how the daughter sees the gf. \n\nShe sees her father fucking someone her age. When she hit puberty did he masturbate over her growing breasts? When she had her friends round was her father taking mental pictures of which one he\u2019d like to fuck? Did he befriend her on social media to wank over her and her friends on nights out?

Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right, so lusting after your daughter\u2019s school friends in their tight cheerleading outfits when they have gone through puberty but can\u2019t legally consent to sex isn\u2019t excused because your wife cheated on you. \n\nThe father should see women the age of his daughter as exactly that. Women young enough to be his daughter. \n\nIf you\u2019re dating/married to someone, please for the love of humanity don\u2019t reproduce.

My only question is OP's dad not invited because of what her mom said versus actual events that happened? 5) is very clear OP is bitter but that doesn't necessarily mean he's the one who caused the estrangement since OP admitted her mom was the one who forced the distance between OP and her dad. That's just fucking sad IMO because we all know there OP's mom probably did a lot of trash talking about her dad and she just accepted it. 6) OP really needs actual heart to heart with her dad.
