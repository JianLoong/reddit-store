For me it would be \"dad plus one\" situation. When I got married (smallish wedding, 70 people), my husband and I couldn't have cared that much because we were so in love and enjoying our day. We wanted our guests to be happy and if dad bringing Sarah makes him happy, fine. People don't constantly have to interact with them and OP could make sure she doesn't have much interaction with her. As for other guests perhaps being annoyed by Sarah or shocked by the age difference: unless Sarah is being in a rude or disturbing way, they can deal with it.", "to her father maybe , but not to her daughter. imagine your dad dating someone your age", "he is adult dating someone the same age as his daughter that disgusting. if my dad did that both lf them wouldnt be invited to my wedding", "I thinking more about his chronological age.", "Therapy would be a lot cheaper then a sugar baby/gold digger.", "Probably.", "[removed]", "Dude, my grandfather's second wife was like that.  They married 10 months after my grandmother passed away. She was all \"I'm your nana now.\" No, lady, you are the lady that married my grandfather when I was 25, took all his money to pay off your kids and grandkids debt, and tried to systematically estrange him from his whole support system. She just didn't count on me not going away like the rest.", "My dad's current wife is a good friend in fact I introduced then.  I was 45 when they married & it's so awkward when people call her my Mom.", "Same. My father\u2019s wife is exactly that. I had a teenager when they married and don\u2019t see her as a mother figure. Certainly don\u2019t see her son as a brother either. I actually found him to be quite rude and entitled. He is also a grown adult with a child a few years younger than mine.", "But legally, she's your stepmother??", "I think he lost sight of that fact, he met his Lady Faire on a sugar baby website and is now denying she's a sugar baby and claiming she's part of the family. Sarah is going to squeeze soooo much money out of him.", "Lol \"your wife\" sure", "If Sarah is the Loud annoying type. With her constant bragging etc. Why does she have to be accommodated just becouse she is dating the dad? Had Sarah been a single friend no one would even blink that she wasn't invited becouse \"your day. If you don't want the drama that's fine\" \n\nBesides your logic has one small flaw. If OP does traditional seating parents will sit close to the newlywed, by extention, Sarah would too as dad's plus one. So OP cannot just avoid her unless dad is banished to the furthest away table. \n\nAgain it all depends on her behaviour, can she sit at the wedding and just converse nicely. Or would it be a loud obnoxious Sarah show about the newest dress dad bought her and baby talking to her husband and not report it all on tiktok?", "Indeed, and a sex worker who he has broken down boundaries with to a point where he's deluding himself that he actually has an emotional relationship with her. That's an uncomfortable dynamic in general, but him wanting to bring her to the wedding brings up the possibility of him wanting to draw attention to his relationship at the wedding", "For the record my father is currently married to someone who is old Enough to be his daughter to and I know how it feels. She and I don\u2019t get a long and I tried. But it\u2019s my fathers life and won\u2019t they I learned just Because I wouldn\u2019t marry someone that much older than me or for money doesn\u2019t mean I should judge others. I am staying out of my Dads relationship \n\nYour dad has horrible taste in women but it\u2019s his life and money and as long as Sarah is giving him what he wants and is honest why care", "Both are adults having a consensual relationship. Why is what any of them do any business of ours?", "Okay, so that's a \"no\" times two?\n\nIn that case why not simplify matters & just not invite him at all?", "Well, it seems they met on a sugar baby website and are open about that, sooooo", "Copied from /u/yasyark from [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zbb0ht/aita_for_refusing_to_invite_my_dads_sugar_baby_to/iyqq3s9/)", "Sounds like my family. She married my grandfather when I was in college. No one liked her and no one has talked to her since my grandfather passed.", "That\u2019s so wonderful\u2026 maybe you can call each other StepBesties!", "When reading family law (at least in my country) they don\u2019t refer to anyone as a \u201cstepmother\u201d or \u201cstepfather\u201d as far as I remember. Rather they talk about husband and wife and children who belong to only one of the spouses  are referred to with a specific term. The only legal aspect I can think of that a stepparent has is that because they are on the hook to support their spouse they will as a side effect have to support any minor children that their spouse has. So no, I don\u2019t think that she is legally a stepmother, or at least she wouldn\u2019t be in my country because it\u2019s not a legal definition.", "\"stepmother\" is not a legal designation. it's a social designation.", "You definitely have something going there about her fathers control of the young girl. And her mothers affair with his own brother! Personally I wouldn\u2019t want either parent at my wedding if I was her. Both are pretty disgusting.", "Exactly, who\u2019s op\u2019s mom to say the relationship is disgusting. You screwed your husbands brother. Get over yourself. And Sarah and the dad are both consenting adults. Who cares the age.", "I didn\u2019t say lost a job. She wouldn\u2019t leave me for that. I said quit and didn\u2019t want another one. Whereas when she gets frustrated with her job I tell her to quit cause we don\u2019t need her income and if it\u2019s gonna make my life more stressful cause she\u2019s missable, I don\u2019t want it. Of course we\u2019d stick by each other in hard times. I was just saying she expects me to always work and I don\u2019t expect her to always work in return. I don\u2019t know how that so hard to comprehend. Of all the vile stuff people do in relationships on here, this one is the agreement people can\u2019t believe takes place.\n\nI\u2019m gonna assume if you go straight to insult you lack the capacity for any type of argument cause you know I\u2019m right.", "Interesting name for his hand", "What you are describing can be any person. The fact that she might be a sugar baby is irrelevant here. If dad had an annoying 45 year old girlfriend with the same behavior, it would be just as annoying. And OP can then also not want her to come. But it would affect her relationship with her dad too.\n\nI guess to me it seems like OP is focussing on the sugar baby part, regardless of how Sarah will behave. And that to me is judgemental.", "You are over simplifying family law so heavily.", "I know I can't dictate what he does, I just don't want her at my wedding.", "Just curious here. If a 32 year old was dating a 17 year old would it be wrong?\n\nWhat if it wasn\u2019t illegal? Would it still be wrong then, or would it suddenly be two consenting adults in a relationship?\n\nWhat if it\u2019s a month before the teenager\u2019s 18th birthday? In a month they\u2019re both considered legally consenting adults. \n\nIs the only thing that makes a relationship dysfunctional or bad whether it\u2019s technically legal?", "My aunt said (after the woman threw a chair at her) that she would not set foot in the house til the old bag died.  The phone rang 6 months later and it was KY grandfather's house phone.  It was my aunt.  God help my soul, I was giggling when I heard her voice", "Umm that's a lovely thought, but very not our style \ud83d\ude09", "It was OP's fianc\u00e9's parents who said the sugar baby relationship is disgusting. OP's parents both suck though, Mom for sleeping with her husband's brother and Dad for being delusional about the transactional nature of his current \"romantic relationship\" and trying to get his gold digger included at his daughter's wedding.", "People absolutely care about the age. He\u2019s dating someone who\u2019s just a year older than his daughter, and that\u2019s disgusting. OP has a right to register her discomfort."]}
