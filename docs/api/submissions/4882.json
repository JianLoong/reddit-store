Ben might even grow to love Tycho in time, if they handle the change well and take it slowly. The answer isn't just immediately get rid of a living, breathing, sentient being because the kid is afraid, when they haven't tried anything else.

I think it's very telling he wants to move now when they could wait for one more year. Can you move with yiur grandparents and take care of tycho there?", "NTA. You protect your dog at all costs. He is a member of the family, & if your dad takes him from you, you have every right to hate him for the rest of your life. If they can't wait a few months, then your dad obviously doesn't care about you at all. Can you move in with your grandparents until you go to college? Shame on your family saying he's just a dog. No. He is your child.", "NTA\n\nWhy can't they try therapy with Ben so he's not so afraid of dogs? Dogs can be so beneficial to people with autism.

Your aunt is so concerned about your dad\u2019s happiness, but what about yours?! You are not being childish. You are being responsible of your dog. I really hope you could find a way to keep Tycho.

While yes, Ben has a right to feel safe in his house, it is also your house (and also Tycho\u2019s).

He neither loves, nor cares, about you, so he doesn't deserve to have you in his life.", "[deleted]", "NTA. Your aunt's comment is nonsense - don't you \"deserve\" to be happy? No-one else but your mother seems to think so. Your father needs to put you first - you are his child.", "NAH. It's an incredibly stressful situation for all involved, and while I can't fault your dad for valuing the a human child over a dog, I can also see how it would be incredibly traumatizing to you. Is there any way one of your friends might take Tycho in for 3-4 months until you move to college and take Tycho with you?", "NTA. Ben can get used to Tycho. Dogs are very beneficial with autistic people.", "Since your intention is to take him with you when you move out, is it possible to have someone you know foster him for a few months?

Read that again.  I'm terribly sorry you are being treated so poorly by the adults in your life.  It appears that they have zero regard for you, your feelings, and your bond with your dog, but instead make everything about themselves and what they want.  I actually thought you had a brilliant compromise about waiting until you move out - yet instead of accepting your compromise they decided to double down.  Shame on them.  I wish I could help solve this problem, but just know this - your are not the asshole, your dad, Melanie, and your aunt are the assholes.  Tycho is your family and should be treated as such!", "NTA - your dog is your family, and they aren\u2019t to be discarded when life changes! \ud83e\udd2c \nYour dad is a massive AH. Dogs can actually be beneficial to those with autism, and WHY IS IT OK FOR YOUR DAD TO CAUSE YOU EVEN MORE EMOTIONAL DAMAGE BECAUSE OF BEN!? \nI\u2019m so mad for you!", "NTA. Your dad and Melanie suck for sending the \u201cBen is more important than you\u201d message out loud and clear. I\u2019m sorry. Big hugs.", "NTA - your father is essentially telling you to throw away a living creature who loves and trusts you and is important to your mental health so he can rush to move his new squeeze in.  What happens if Ben doesn't like you?  Do you get thrown out too?  I'm being hyperbolic, but as an animal lover, I just despise people who think pets can be tossed like this.  Your ask to wait until spring when you can take Tycho with you is not unreasonable.  You're not making him choose between you and Melanie, you're asking for a bit of consideration.  Now, you will loose on this issue because your dad has made his decision, so all I can think to suggest is whether you have a friend who might take Tycho for a few months or could you go stay with your grandparents and take care of Tycho there; I suspect your dad would be happy with this since it gets him what he wants.", "NTA \n\nI think you came up with a reasonable compromise of having them wait to move in together so that you can take the dog when you move away to college. \n\nIt\u2019s so cruel of your dad to do this especially if he knows that there are no options for the dog to live anywhere else with your family and would need to be rehomed. Why do they HAVE to move in for the holidays? Is there some detail we\u2019re missing? Also curious if they can just make some kind of arrangement for the time being where Tycho is just kept away from the kid? In a other room or out in the yard depending on where the kid is?", "[deleted]", "NTA. Your dad is being an asshole.", "I think it\u2019s something to do with her lease or something, I don\u2019t know.  Maybe also having time to move.

He has a responsibility to his daughter and dog that he got her. She can move in later and the fact she's rethinking the engagement cause his daughter doesn't want to get rid of her dog is a red flag and manipulative of her.", "Dad isn\u2019t allowed to put his new family ahead of what\u2019s good for his existing family.\n\nI mean, he\u2019s legally allowed to. But it makes him TA.\n\nWe\u2019re not talking about them splitting up. Just waiting a few months for the sake of his daughter.

Dogs are not given up lightly and dad should have thought through AT LEAST the timing given OP\u2019s age. It\u2019s not *all* about the romantic relationship and its natural pace. He\u2019s a father and has responsibilities, and a dog is a commitment, not just a plaything.", "Nope, OPs dad is definitely the AH here. \n\nNTA", "The dad is being ridiculous! This is not a life or death situation where the kid is fatally allergic to the dog or the dog has attempted to bite this kids face off. Also why does the step mom need to move in on this specific timeline? Will she be evicted from her home and made to live on the streets if they don\u2019t move in over the holidays? I doubt it. I get the dad wanting to save money and live with his fianc\u00e9, but it\u2019s not all about him and the fianc\u00e9. They have made no effort to compromise and are making plans that are convenient to them while screwing over OP", "I was thinking they should bring in a therapist to work with acclimating Ben and Tycho.  But I don't think the answer is to automatically get rid of the dog!", "this is such a gross take. Why is it on a 17 year old to fix this situation?", "Uh her dad already has family. He isn\u2019t doing his own daughter a favor for trying to \u201cstill include her\u201d ffs she\u2019s his daughter and they live together.", "But then it's so easy for his mother to make a move with Ben!? And he is supposed to live from one day to the next in a completely new area, house and room? With two other people he doesn't know well. That's going to be the real horror for him as an autistic person. But OP's dad and stepmother have no problem with that....\nMaybe Ben was just anxious about the environment and not the dog.", "Gotcha. I think you need to have an honest conversation with your dad and ask him if he is willing to deal with that added hassle for the sake of your relationship. His stance on this seems very callous.", "And that\u2019s just it would be more trouble and expense to wait. But it\u2019s still possible to wait. Sometimes we have to do things as adults that are more expensive and time-consuming than the ideally would like. NTA", "What a lame excuse. Basically it\u2019s just about convenience. Then saving some money and not going through the trouble of waiting is more important than allowing you to keep you dog. Omg your dad really sucks.", "Yes, Dad.  Being a grown up means being patient and staying true to your commitments.  Sorry you are in this situation.  I hate to suggest this but you might want to start looking for a temporary home for Tycho.  Many schools require freshmen to live in the dorms, and dogs can't live in a dorm.  If you can find a friend or relative to foster him, you paying for his support and visiting him often, might be a difficult but doable plan.", "i don\u2019t disagree with anything you\u2019re saying. i\u2019m mostly just heartbroken about the situation.", "[deleted]", "Autism can be really weird, and it might be entirely possible that having a dog is indeed too stimulating. That being said, it is true that the stepmother could wait till spring.", "Sure, he might not be TRYING to be one. Unfortunately, he is. It is a tough spot, but the solution he settled on was a bad one.", "Yeah it\u2019s important to him to have them move in but OP is trying to say that dad can\u2019t EVER live with his fianc\u00e9 and her kid she\u2019s asking them to wait a few months so that she doesn\u2019t have to get rid of her dog??? \n\nDad and step-mom are being insanely selfish right now. Unless the fianc\u00e9 and kid are going to be evicted and homeless UNLESS they move in over the holidays, I don\u2019t really understand why they can\u2019t just wait in order to keep the peace and not royally screw over OP. That\u2019s not a very good way to start a blended family if you ask me.", "Yeah I completely understand that. I think the thing that\u2019s getting to me is the insistence that they need to move in now. OP responded to another comment that the reasoning for them moving in sooner is to save money and because it will be more \u201ctrouble\u201d if they wait. I\u2019m sorry, but so what? Saving money and having things be more convenient is not a valid excuse to get rid of his daughters pet. Dad needs to suck it up and realize that not everything can go his way when he has a daughter to think about. Blending families is tough and it can go SO wrong it\u2019s just such a bad move for the dad to do this and start off on the wrong foot. How can he expect OP to want to be involved in this new family when they\u2019re putting her through something like this?", "completely agreed", "I don't think this family will ever actually blend.  Dad doesn't care about her feelings, it's all about his new life and making sure it goes the way he wants.  This is not an uncommon pattern and I suspect that even without the dog as an issue, she would be last and least going forward.  That he is being so callous about the dog is very telling.  She needs to just get ready to go out on her own with Tycho.", "NTA\n\nDad can get you an apartment for a year until you turn 18.

Do you have any friends who might be able to take your dog in for the next year?\n\n(Also, I hate to tell you this, but finding a college apartment which is going to allow a large dog like Tycho is also going to be difficult.

That makes me think she had the intentions of trying to make you watch her kid while her and your dad did whatever they wanted.", "NTA at all. First of all, you are this close to becoming an adult, they shouldn't want to uproot your life in this stage and just let the natural course of events take care of that. When you move out, they can move in.\n\nSecond of all, the logical alternative IF they cannot wait is that the kid is socialized with the dog. They can hire experts for that if they can't do it. \n\nDon't let them give you a feeling of guilt for something so unnecessary.

That way when you go to college, you'll have more rights and protections in housing with Tycho. \n\nWishing you all the best", "Nta. Maybe a compromise can be met,  can your dad afford a one bedroom apartment for you and your dog for the next few months while you finish school up?", "NTA, every adult you've mentioned is the A here. I'm so angry on your behalf.", "NTA - I hate to suggest this but take the matter out of your father\u2019s hands and try to temporarily rehouse Tycho with a friend or family member who is sympathetic to you. You\u2019re right to worry about leaving your dog alone at home, it seems very plausible that your father could take the matter out of your hands and take Tycho to a shelter.", "Huge red flag on your dad's fianc\u00e9 having second thoughts cause you won't be living with them. If you had a relationship that's one thing, but it sounds like she's upset to lose a default babysitter.", "NTA at all and I\u2019d double down with dad and say flat out if he forces you to rehome the dog you will go NC forever and he will never be a part of you and any future life you have, including grandkids if you ever have kids.", "NTA,\n\nyour dad's first priority should be his own daughter. That clearly is not the case.", "NTA. Reiterate that you will never forgive him if he even attempts to give away your best friend. If they can\u2019t wait a few months to move in then there is something seriously wrong with the relationship.\nTycho is your closest companion, you are NOT overreacting.", "NTA but your dad is a major a-hole for thinking that giving up a pet because it is inconvenient is in any way ok!", "I feel like there are NAH.\n\nSounds like Melanie is having second thoughts about if this new home is going to be a safe space for her Autistic child. She is putting her son's wellbeing before her love life, which is honestly the right thing. Autistic kids *need* so many things that neurotypical kids can live without or adapt to. It's not their fault, their brains are wired differently.\n\nOP, you shouldn't be asked to give up your beloved dog of 5 years, and an Autistic child shouldn't be forced to live in a house with an animal that triggers him.\n\nI feel bad for your Dad, but he might have to let Melanie go for everyone's comfort and health.\n\nIt just sounds incompatible all around and no one is at fault.", "As much as you love him you may need to reach out to a malamute rescue. So start doing research now, just in case.", "NTA your dads a fucking asshole", "NTA your aren't making this a choice between them and you, your dad has already chosen them over you.\n\nIs there anyway you can move in with your mom or grandparents temporarily with Tycho? Then when you go to college you can find a place with him.\n\nI grew up with malautes and they are giant teddy bears and the best doggos", "NTA \u2014 your dad and Melanie are though. Pets are not disposable and it boils my blood when people think they can just get rid of them when it becomes inconvenient. I would move mountains to keep my cat. Your bond with Tycho is just as valid as your bond with any human. I\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019ve been treated so poorly. Your dad hasn\u2019t made any effort to try to come up with an effective solution or compromise with you so he\u2019s being a shitty parent. There\u2019s no reason why something can\u2019t be done to try to help Ben get over his fear of dogs or for them to move in after you move out in 6 months. It also seems weird that Melanie is having second thoughts about moving in if you\u2019re moving out. Sounds like she\u2019s looking for free babysitting. Ultimately, you and Tycho were there first. I really hope something works out and that you and your boy can stay together. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. Dad can be mad all he wants, but when it comes down to it, yes, he is facing a choice between his child and his fiance, and his child should come first. If their engagement is so tenuous that something like this has her reconsidering the marriage, then maybe they aren't ready to get married and manage a blended family. You've offered a reasonable compromise; why do they NEED to move over the holidays? I would get a GPS/tracking collar for Tycho if it were me. Please update!", "Nya, your dad and fiance are way out of line here. Your situation would already have damaged my trust in a parent beyond repair . I hope it'll work out for you and your dog.", "NTA. Your dog was there first. Your dad is the one that encouraged the dog. You have a bond with him. I don't think it's fair for them to just disregard your feelings. The new girlfriend clearly doesn't care that this hurts you. Which is selfish and your dad not seeing this self centered attitude, that her child is more important...that's sad. Of course her sons feelings matter too but I agree that they can put off living together until you go off to college and can find a better solution. Your dog is important.", "NTA at all", "Again, another baffling blended family story where the adults are being selfish and the kids are facing the consequences of it. Your father IS choosing his fiance and son over your comfort. Sure, his stepson should feel safe in his own home, which is WHY his mother should wait to move in. I get that housing costs are expensive which is why they want to downsize, but not at the expense of her future stepdaughter/your fathers ACTUAL CHILD. \n\nAlso, can we talk about how emotionally manipulative it is for her to hold you up as the reason for \"calling off the engagement\"?! She's putting him in this position, not you. \n\nYour father does deserve to be happy, but not at your expense. I bet if you asked your aunt if you and Tycho could move in she'd balk. \n\nNTA, and start saving money for vet care and pet deposits", "NTA \n\nI swear I\u2019ve read this story on here before though.", "NTA.  Very cruel of your father.  Could you contact a malamute rescue organization and see if someone can foster your dog until you are ready to leave for college?  It might be close enough for you to visit your dog regularly, which would be good for both of you.", "NTA\n\nIt's crazy anyone thinks it's ok to get rid of your dog.", "NTA. There is a time your dad needs to understand having a child comes with its own sacrifices. If Melanie has an autistic son who doesn't like the dog and your father has a child (you) who os attached to the dog, they are simply not made for each other. You did offer the solution that is a good one and he rejected it? You can't just give your child a dog and then rehome him 5 years later, especially not when it's so easily avoidable by *check's notes* just telling your girlfriend \"Not yet, wait for a bit\". This will emotionally ruin both you and the dog. It's not about stepson or the dog, it's about stepson or bio daughter. Doesn't he care enough about you to just WAIT, that's literally all? Now your father has to choose: is his relationship with his girlfriend really more important than one with his own daughter? Because he WILL lose you if he goes forward with this and honestly? He should. Also, tell your dear auntie to look after the dog and solve this, since she is so interested in your business", "NTA", "NTA. You deserve to be happy. Your dad could do many other things - like even putting things off.", "NTA, but it definitely seems like your dad is the AH here.", "NTA - how about getting a trainer or a therapist to work with the kid & the dog & the family as a whole? I'm sure that with some time & effort, they can find a peaceful coexistence.", "NTA.\n\nI am a parent of an autistic child.  There were things that she didn't like but now doesn't mind.  I.e. she hated anything touching the back of her head - not even water and she refused showers.  Now, she is in swimming lessons doing her starfish floats on her back.\n\nAccomodations include getting her son help to deal with certain issues so perhaps get a therapist to help him with his dog issue.\n\nThe dog is pre-existing in this whole dynamic.  He is not a lesser than anyone else.  He is a member of your family.", "YTA. I think you are being childish. I'm going through a little different situation that involves my dogs and my relationship so I can see the other point of view. I don't think it's fair that your dad's relationship should suffer because of your dog. You're demanding that he has to drop his life and put things off for your dog while continuing to take care of a dog that is upsetting to the family he's trying to move on with. Plus, what makes you so sure you'll be able to afford to keep your dog while you're at college? Not all dorms and apartments allow dogs and most have size restrictions. Unless money is no issue there's still the cost of feed, routine care, veterinary care, and doggy daycare because between classes, studying and possibly a job you'll not have much time for your dog. I think you need to consider being a little more reasonable and maybe look for a foster home or actively search for a stable home for your dog. Your dad was trying to make you happy by getting the dog but didn't consider the reasons that might not be a good idea.", "Agree. This is sad, but OP should be prepared that it is going to be very, very difficult as a college student to find a place big enough for such a large dog.", "This is such an important thing to consider. I have a lot of sympathy for OP and she's definitely NTA, but realistically, she's looking at a hard time ahead. Pets are expensive for all of the reasons you've listed, and I hope that she's able to manage it but she needs to start preparing ASAP", "There\u2019s also the option of getting him registered as an emotional support animal and taking him to the dorms with you. For you, he is a huge factor in helping with your emotions and you should have no trouble getting a letter from a therapist. Your college may also require other documentation so you\u2019ll need to contact them to find out. It may require you to live in a specific dorm, though, so know that. You will still have to cover food, vet expenses, etc. though so you\u2019ll need a job regardless.", "Agreed. Both OPs dad and Melanie are thinking too much about themselves and not enough about their kid's needs.", "Agreed, op and her dog were living there first too, also a best friend pet can be really important for a teenager's/young adult's mental health especially considering turbulent past. Since she said they're gonna move out quite soon with the dog, the father has multiple options and compromises available, like blocking off a part of the house so the dog can't free roam in whole house while op is at school, just postpone his gf moving in until op moves out, maybe building necessary structures (dog house, fences etc) in the yard and keep the dog in the yard during daytime until op comes back from school and takes over dealing with the dog inside (obv only outside when it's not too hot or cold and that fresh water and housing/kennel for shade is provided etc etc), or something else. Most things in life are compromiseable. Well only if parties involved want to compromise, not just bulldoze over everyone else.", "This is a really good point. OP should ask her Dad what his expectations are of watching the stepson, because OP might need to move her timeline up to get out of the house faster if they expect OP to be consistently available to watch the 9 y.o. \"Needs a lot of accommodations\" sounds like he isn't very high functioning and they may see OP as the ticket to getting the child taken care of for free and still getting to enjoy a honeymoon phase.", "Sounds like Melanie is having second thoughts about if this new home is going to be a safe space for her Autistic child. She is putting her son's wellbeing before her love life, which is honestly the right thing.\n\nI feel like there are NAH.\n\nDad wants his new relationship to work out, OP needs their dog and Melanie is looking out for her son. It just sounds incompatible all around and no one is at fault.", "I doubt she was counting on OP being free childcare.\n\nShe seems to recognize that she would be disrupting OP's life in a big way by moving in, so much so OP is willing to move out. Melanie seems like a kind person who isn't going to break up a family for a romantic partner, nor cause her son distress for the same reason.\n\nShe's bowing out of the situation instead of forcing the children involved to be unhappy so she can get what she wants. She's acting with grace and maturity, not vindictiveness.", "Ben is Autistic. His brain is wired differently and if dogs are a trigger for him they will be for his entire life. It would cause him serious mental harm to be forced to live with Tycho.\n\nHis mother is looking out for him, like she should be. She also seems to understand how difficult and hurtful it would be to make OP give Tycho up, which is why she's rethinking the engagement entirely.\n\nThese two families just aren't compatible it sucks but that's life.", "I\u2019m going to see if they would be willing, they could probably use the help anyway, but my dad is going to throw a fit and I don\u2019t want him to make things hard on them either.  I\u2019m going to talk to them this afternoon after school.", "Yes.  I have a cat and people even struggle to find rentals with them.  Unfortunately, dad likely got the dog to keep them coming over but didn't seem to be committed to keeping the dog.", "NTA. It\u2019s true, the dog and you were there first and if he gets rid of YOUR dog he sucks. He can wait until the spring when you move out. The other kids feelings and diagnosis does not trump your feelings", "Yep.  Heck I pay a lot just for flea meds for a cat!  Plus, her food is pricy (I do buy better quality foods though).  Buying food and flea meds alone for a dog that size is going to be a significant expense.  Let alone vet bills and the extra money to pay for housing.", ">Pets are expensive for all of the reasons you've listed\n\nThe least her dad could do is help out with costs. He bought the damn dog, and then decided he didn't want it anymore.", "I completely understand that everyone cares about what he will feed the dog etc. but I think a dog much rather eat cheap food than be taken away from someone they love. Many dogs/cats never recover from being abandoned or re-homed. They continue to struggle with anxiety, stop eating or get sick. Me and my husband live in a tiny apartment and had to take in his family cat, she\u2019s lived with his family for 9 yrs, but they bought a new house and got a dog so they \u201ccouldn\u2019t\u201d keep her. She was miserable after being sent to a family friend, so we took her. She was pulling her fur and was depressed. Now her fur is back to being soft and she\u2019s even starting to play", "Dad was too busy getting his dick wet", "I can pretty much guarantee she\u2019s just putting the pressure on Dad to get her way. Some stepparents see themselves as taking on a parenting role, others see the kids from the old relationship as an impediment. If she\u2019s making \u201cyour daughter\u2019s dog or me\u201d ultimatums, that\u2019s ultimately means \u201cyour daughter or me\u201d and Dad here looks good and ready to make the shittiest choice.", "How do you know that?", "Take Tycho to the vet and get him chipped in your name, if he isn't already, as soon as possible.\n\nYou're also old enough to choose where you want to live, and court can move slowly. I'd see about living with your grandparents for a while if that's possible. If you're close with them, it's great to have that quality time with them. I lived with my grandmother for a while as a student, and some of the best memories we had together were made during that time before she passed.", "Get Tycho chipped OP and also check the laws in your state. It's completely possible that you're independent enough now that a court will simply let you do as you please.", "You're almost 18.\n\nCourts will take your wants and needs into account as to where you want to live.\n\nIf your Dad wants to have a showdown over you having to give up your dog so he can have other people move in,  which is forcing you to choose your grandparents' place,  the courts may take a dim view of your father.\n\nIt won't go his way.\n\nIs he a controlling or combative person?\n\nMany divorces are contentious, but the fact that you're predicting that he'll have a meltdown because you'd want to move in temporarily with your grandparents, so you can keep your beloved dog, makes him look petty and volatile.", "Update us when you can!", "Let them fight. It\u2019s not your problem or your fault that your parents are incapable of being civil with each other (although given the circumstances your dad is a total AH and your mom would be right to be pissed). You\u2019re 17, no judge is going to override your wishes about where you want to live, especially given *why* you want to live there. They can tell and scream and go to Family Court all they want. Talk to your grandparents, figure out how to help them with the property, and have a wonderful time with Tycho! NTA obviously", "It's so hard to successfully blend a family in the first place, and OP's father will have blown up any chance at this if he goes through with it.", "Don't forget about how important grooming is for a dog like that.

They've been put in an awful position right now, honestly. Fingers crossed for her to he able to figure everything out.", "If you want really good flea meds for your pet but don't want to pay out the butt, go to pet friendly.com.
