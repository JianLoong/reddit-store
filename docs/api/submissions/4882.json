I try not to talk about them to each other and just keep things separate.\n\nAll the fighting and chaos was hard on me and was effecting my mood and school work when it was all going down, so my dad felt bad and let me have a dog to help me feel better.  Someone nearby had malamute puppies, so I picked out one and his name is  Tycho and he\u2019s my best friend. Even on the weeks I\u2019m with my mom I stop by after school every day to take him to the dog park to play and get his cuddles in. I love this dog.\n\nMy dad started dating Melanie a few years ago.  I don\u2019t really connect with her, we\u2019re just really different and she\u2019s way too touchy, but she makes my dad happy so whatever.  Her son Ben (9M) is autistic and needs a lot of accommodations, he gets really upset and has meltdowns when things change or are done differently.  He\u2019s also really scared of Tycho even though as far as I know Tycho has never done anything to scare him, he\u2019s a really laid back and well behaved dog.\n\nDad and Melanie recently got engaged and they want to go ahead and move her and Ben in so that they can get rid of their apartment and save money.  My dad told me about it and said that since Ben is afraid of Tycho and needs a stable environment at home, Tycho is going to have to go somewhere else. My mom\u2019s townhouse doesn\u2019t have room for him and my grandparents aren\u2019t in good enough health to look after a big dog, so we would have to rehome him.\n\nI admit I didn\u2019t take it very well and we had a big fight.  I told him that no way was I going to give up my dog and I\u2019m going to college next year anyway so they can put off the move until the spring when I can find a place to take him with me. My dad says they need to do the move over the holidays and Ben is more important than a dog. I told him if he gives away my dog I\u2019ll never forgive him and that he obviously thinks Ben is more important than me, too.\n\nMy dad is mad because I\u2019m making this a choice between me and his fiance basically, Melanie is having second thoughts about the engagement since I \u201cdon\u2019t want to live with them\u201d, my mom is mad at my dad and they\u2019re fighting again, and I\u2019m afraid to leave Tycho alone because he might not be there when I get back. My aunt says I\u2019m being childish and my dad deserves to be happy.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit - I talked to my mom and grandparents after school.  I brought Tycho to my mom\u2019s place this afternoon and I\u2019m going to to take him to my grandparents tomorrow.  I\u2019m going to split time between them and my mom for awhile and my grandparents said that if I go to college nearby I can live with them while I study to make sure I don\u2019t lose my dog.  So I\u2019m going to look at maybe doing two years at a local college and then transferring to a university later.  I haven\u2019t told my dad yet, but I will after I get Tycho settled tomorrow, I already went online and made sure his chip information is up to date with all my info and my mom\u2019s as backup. Pretty sure all hell is going to break loose but honestly, I\u2019d do almost anything to not lose my dog including just not going to college right now if that\u2019s what I have to do.

Ben might even grow to love Tycho in time, if they handle the change well and take it slowly. The answer isn't just immediately get rid of a living, breathing, sentient being because the kid is afraid, when they haven't tried anything else.

He is a member of the family, & if your dad takes him from you, you have every right to hate him for the rest of your life.

While yes, Ben has a right to feel safe in his house, it is also your house (and also Tycho\u2019s).

It's an incredibly stressful situation for all involved, and while I can't fault your dad for valuing the a human child over a dog, I can also see how it would be incredibly traumatizing to you.

Dogs are very beneficial with autistic people.", "Since your intention is to take him with you when you move out, is it possible to have someone you know foster him for a few months?

Read that again.  I'm terribly sorry you are being treated so poorly by the adults in your life.  It appears that they have zero regard for you, your feelings, and your bond with your dog, but instead make everything about themselves and what they want.

What happens if Ben doesn't like you?  Do you get thrown out too?  I'm being hyperbolic, but as an animal lover, I just despise people who think pets can be tossed like this.  Your ask to wait until spring when you can take Tycho with you is not unreasonable.  You're not making him choose between you and Melanie, you're asking for a bit of consideration.  Now, you will loose on this issue because your dad has made his decision, so all I can think to suggest is whether you have a friend who might take Tycho for a few months or could you go stay with your grandparents and take care of Tycho there; I suspect your dad would be happy with this since it gets him what he wants.", "NTA \n\nI think you came up with a reasonable compromise of having them wait to move in together so that you can take the dog when you move away to college. \n\nIt\u2019s so cruel of your dad to do this especially if he knows that there are no options for the dog to live anywhere else with your family and would need to be rehomed. Why do they HAVE to move in for the holidays? Is there some detail we\u2019re missing?

I get the dad wanting to save money and live with his fianc\u00e9, but it\u2019s not all about him and the fianc\u00e9.

I think you need to have an honest conversation with your dad and ask him if he is willing to deal with that added hassle for the sake of your relationship. His stance on this seems very callous.", "And that\u2019s just it would be more trouble and expense to wait. But it\u2019s still possible to wait. Sometimes we have to do things as adults that are more expensive and time-consuming than the ideally would like. NTA", "What a lame excuse. Basically it\u2019s just about convenience. Then saving some money and not going through the trouble of waiting is more important than allowing you to keep you dog. Omg your dad really sucks.", "Yes, Dad.  Being a grown up means being patient and staying true to your commitments.  Sorry you are in this situation.  I hate to suggest this but you might want to start looking for a temporary home for Tycho.  Many schools require freshmen to live in the dorms, and dogs can't live in a dorm.  If you can find a friend or relative to foster him, you paying for his support and visiting him often, might be a difficult but doable plan.", "i don\u2019t disagree with anything you\u2019re saying. i\u2019m mostly just heartbroken about the situation.", "[deleted]", "Autism can be really weird, and it might be entirely possible that having a dog is indeed too stimulating. That being said, it is true that the stepmother could wait till spring.", "Sure, he might not be TRYING to be one. Unfortunately, he is. It is a tough spot, but the solution he settled on was a bad one.", "Yeah it\u2019s important to him to have them move in but OP is trying to say that dad can\u2019t EVER live with his fianc\u00e9 and her kid she\u2019s asking them to wait a few months so that she doesn\u2019t have to get rid of her dog??? \n\nDad and step-mom are being insanely selfish right now.

That\u2019s not a very good way to start a blended family if you ask me.", "Yeah I completely understand that. I think the thing that\u2019s getting to me is the insistence that they need to move in now. OP responded to another comment that the reasoning for them moving in sooner is to save money and because it will be more \u201ctrouble\u201d if they wait. I\u2019m sorry, but so what? Saving money and having things be more convenient is not a valid excuse to get rid of his daughters pet. Dad needs to suck it up and realize that not everything can go his way when he has a daughter to think about. Blending families is tough and it can go SO wrong it\u2019s just such a bad move for the dad to do this and start off on the wrong foot. How can he expect OP to want to be involved in this new family when they\u2019re putting her through something like this?", "completely agreed", "I don't think this family will ever actually blend.  Dad doesn't care about her feelings, it's all about his new life and making sure it goes the way he wants.  This is not an uncommon pattern and I suspect that even without the dog as an issue, she would be last and least going forward.  That he is being so callous about the dog is very telling.  She needs to just get ready to go out on her own with Tycho.", "NTA\n\nDad can get you an apartment for a year until you turn 18. I mean, if he wants to \"accommodate\" you.", "NTA\n\nThere's a lot weird going on here. Melanie is having second thoughts because a SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD doesn't want to live with them? It's like, how long did she even expect you were going to be living with them anyhow?\n\nHave you talked with your parents and grandparents about this without your dad?

Since she said they're gonna move out quite soon with the dog, the father has multiple options and compromises available, like blocking off a part of the house so the dog can't free roam in whole house while op is at school, just postpone his gf moving in until op moves out, maybe building necessary structures (dog house, fences etc) in the yard and keep the dog in the yard during daytime until op comes back from school and takes over dealing with the dog inside (obv only outside when it's not too hot or cold and that fresh water and housing/kennel for shade is provided etc etc), or something else.
