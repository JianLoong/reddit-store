He can't just dismiss and your dog you when it doesn't suit him anymore.\n\nThe dog is not just a piece of furniture you can get rid of. He accepted it in the family, now he has to assume the fact that you cannot just throw a dog in the garbage when you are done.", "**NTA**. I'd rather die than rehome my dog. Ben might even grow to love Tycho in time, if they handle the change well and take it slowly. The answer isn't just immediately get rid of a living, breathing, sentient being because the kid is afraid, when they haven't tried anything else. I appreciate the autism will make things more difficult, but there has to be other routes to go down without immediately jumping to \"give Tycho away\". \n\nI hope they don't try and do anything behind your back OP.", "NTA.  Your dad shouldn't have given you a dog to take it away later.  However, you also need to be prepared.  It isn't easy to find a place to take a large dog. If your plan is to bring him with you, you need to be working and saving money.  You will likely need to rent a house(or a room in a house where they let you have him), and you'll have vet bills to cover, food, etc.", "NTA. \"Ben is more important than a dog.

I suggest LC or hell even NC after this stunt.", "you're a hero and your dad sucks - NTA", "NTA. I usually side with parents, but rehoming your dog because he can\u2019t wait 6 months to move his GF into the house seems like he IS choosing his GF over his child, and that\u2019s a huge no-no. Melanie\u2019s son does have a right to feel safe in his own home, but that does not include forcing you to get rid of your dog. That\u2019s just not a legitimate thought to have. Maybe Melanie SHOULD have second thoughts about your dad.", "NTA.  You shouldn\u2019t have to give up your dog because of another kid. As far as I can tell from your post, Ben has no reason to be afraid of your dog. Your dad & Melanie would do better by both you & Ben to help Ben and Tycho become friends.

Seems arbitrary.", "NTA - so sorry you are going through this, it just sucks.      Your dad has options on timing, I'm not sure why putting off moving in together for less than a year so Tycho can move with you is not something he's willing to do?   In the big picture that's not a long time.\n\nHad a serious bf one time tell me \"It's me or the dog\".   I picked the dog.

Your dad got you that dog and in doing so committed to having the dog the rest of its life. Not to mention you trauma bonded with the dog while trying to deal with what sounds like an ugly divorce. You shouldn\u2019t be expected to give up your most prized possession that means the world to you for someone who just entered your life recently.\n\nHow big is dad\u2019s house? Would it be possible to keep Tycho and Ben separated using baby gates or some other barrier?", "NTA. I am so sick of seeing autism used to excuse everything. Maybe he's afraid, but he's exposed to him in very short increments, if at all. \n\nI think having a 9 year old adjust to the fact that even at home not everyone will revolve around them is something that needs to happen. \n\nMy concern would be for the dog, in the event that the 9 year old may try to harm the dog. \n\nI'm sorry you're dealing with this. Your dad seems like a selfish guy with an inability to compromise.", "Melanie seems to be the person with the most sense here.  She should be rethinking moving in 6 months before you leave.  You are of course NTA.", "NTA dogs are not expendable they are a life long commitment, the kid is not allergic he's just afraid, autistic kids can adjust to change it just takes time and work his mom and your dad are lazy and don't want to do the work. If my parent got rid of my pet i would literally never speak to them, tell him he hopes he never wanted to be a grandparent because someone who thinks something I love that deeply is disposable is never getting near any kids I ever have.", "Sounds like the adults around you really didn\u2019t think this timing through at all well.

At 17 you expect your wants and needs to be taken into account, not just dictated to you by an adult.\n\nMelanie was really deceiving herself if she thought you would happily trade Tycho in for a stepfamily. Of course you don\u2019t want to live with them under those conditions!\n\nTycho should not have to be separated from you when a few months can solve that part.", "NTA\n\nThat dog is a member of your family too, and he means a lot to you. \n\nHave you expressed the importance of when you got your pup, given everything that was happening when you got him?\n\nHave you interacted with her son? Has he been over to the house with you? The change in scenery could be a huge adjustment for him and they might be asking you to move out next!", " NTA. Where I think your dad is, is because he won\u2019t compromise to wait until the spring. That sounds completely reasonable.\n\nMelanie is also slightly TA for making this the hill to die on moment where your dad needs to prove that she\u2019s most important. I get that she\u2019s worried about her neurodivergent kid and his problems with the dog. But had it been her kid\u2019s dog, I can guarantee she wouldn\u2019t rehome him.", "NTA.\n\nIts absolutely cruel to expect you to give up your dog.\n\nIf the stepson has behavioral issues, they need to work with his doctor to address them. How sad they are demanding the doggo get booted from his home and owner.", "NAH.\n\nYour dad is a person too; he's allowed to fall in love and he's allowed to want his fiance and her son to move in.\n\nYou're allowed to be upset about it.\n\nSometimes life is just hard.", "NTA. It\u2019s true, the dog and you were there first and if he gets rid of YOUR dog he sucks. He can wait until the spring when you move out. The other kids feelings and diagnosis does not trump your feelings", "NTA  Pets are not accessories to be discarded on a whim.  You have every right to defend your dog and to let your dad know what is riding on HIS decision about the housing situation.  I would never forgive someone who expected me to or coerced me into giving up a pet for their own convenience. NEVER.", "NTA. I think it's very telling he wants to move now when they could wait for one more year. Can you move with yiur grandparents and take care of tycho there?", "NTA. You protect your dog at all costs. He is a member of the family, & if your dad takes him from you, you have every right to hate him for the rest of your life. If they can't wait a few months, then your dad obviously doesn't care about you at all. Can you move in with your grandparents until you go to college? Shame on your family saying he's just a dog. No. He is your child.", "NTA\n\nWhy can't they try therapy with Ben so he's not so afraid of dogs? Dogs can be so beneficial to people with autism. Really, rehoming Tycho when he's a part of the family?? You're right that your dad is choosing them over you.\n\nWe had a malamute a long time ago, they are awesome dogs, so friendly with big doggy smiles. He was a neighborhood icon, everyone loved him.", "NTA. Tycho is part of the family too. My dog is my kid. I wouldn\u2019t rehome my dog because of a fianc\u00e9 who is already having second thought. Your aunt is so concerned about your dad\u2019s happiness, but what about yours?! You are not being childish. You are being responsible of your dog. I really hope you could find a way to keep Tycho. Is it possible to keep Tycho and Ben in separate areas of the house? Or is it possible for you get to a housing arrangement that would allow you to keep Tycho with you while you are in college?", "NTA. Fuck these selfish AHs. Get your dog somewhere safe, move out, and never look back.", "NTA. The only painfully obvious AH is the dad. While yes, Ben has a right to feel safe in his house, it is also your house (and also Tycho\u2019s). From what you wrote, I noticed that there is no one that could take him in, but what if you go as well (short term) to your grandparents\u2019 place with Tycho? Just until you can get a place of your own. That way you can take care of Tycho, help your grandparents and get the peace you deserve", "Tycho is not \u201ca dog\u201d, he\u2019s family. You father should know better. NTA", "Nta\n\nMake it perfectly clear to your dad that if he wants any relationship with you going forward, they need to find a way to make you keeping your dog work. If he unilaterally makes the decision about YOUR dog, do what you can to track it and the home it's in so you can get it back when you move out, then go no contact with your dad. He neither loves, nor cares, about you, so he doesn't deserve to have you in his life.", "NAH. this is just a really shitty situation. i\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through it. your feelings are valid and so are your dad\u2019s. and my condolences on having to weather the storm that is your divorced parents\u2019 torrential relationship. I don\u2019t have an answer. i don\u2019t really think anyone is being the asshole here.", "NTA. Your aunt's comment is nonsense - don't you \"deserve\" to be happy? No-one else but your mother seems to think so. Your father needs to put you first - you are his child.", "NAH. It's an incredibly stressful situation for all involved, and while I can't fault your dad for valuing the a human child over a dog, I can also see how it would be incredibly traumatizing to you. Is there any way one of your friends might take Tycho in for 3-4 months until you move to college and take Tycho with you?", "NTA. Ben can get used to Tycho. Dogs are very beneficial with autistic people.", "Since your intention is to take him with you when you move out, is it possible to have someone you know foster him for a few months? The dog, not the crotch critter. \n\nWould your grandparents be able to manage it for a short time, or can you stay with them to help them out for a few months?", "YOU ARE NOT THE ASSHOLE!!!!!!!  Read that again.  I'm terribly sorry you are being treated so poorly by the adults in your life.  It appears that they have zero regard for you, your feelings, and your bond with your dog, but instead make everything about themselves and what they want.  I actually thought you had a brilliant compromise about waiting until you move out - yet instead of accepting your compromise they decided to double down.  Shame on them.  I wish I could help solve this problem, but just know this - your are not the asshole, your dad, Melanie, and your aunt are the assholes.  Tycho is your family and should be treated as such!", "NTA - your dog is your family, and they aren\u2019t to be discarded when life changes! \ud83e\udd2c \nYour dad is a massive AH. Dogs can actually be beneficial to those with autism, and WHY IS IT OK FOR YOUR DAD TO CAUSE YOU EVEN MORE EMOTIONAL DAMAGE BECAUSE OF BEN!? \nI\u2019m so mad for you!", "NTA. Your dad and Melanie suck for sending the \u201cBen is more important than you\u201d message out loud and clear. I\u2019m sorry. Big hugs.", "NTA - your father is essentially telling you to throw away a living creature who loves and trusts you and is important to your mental health so he can rush to move his new squeeze in.  What happens if Ben doesn't like you?  Do you get thrown out too?  I'm being hyperbolic, but as an animal lover, I just despise people who think pets can be tossed like this.  Your ask to wait until spring when you can take Tycho with you is not unreasonable.  You're not making him choose between you and Melanie, you're asking for a bit of consideration.  Now, you will loose on this issue because your dad has made his decision, so all I can think to suggest is whether you have a friend who might take Tycho for a few months or could you go stay with your grandparents and take care of Tycho there; I suspect your dad would be happy with this since it gets him what he wants.", "NTA \n\nI think you came up with a reasonable compromise of having them wait to move in together so that you can take the dog when you move away to college. \n\nIt\u2019s so cruel of your dad to do this especially if he knows that there are no options for the dog to live anywhere else with your family and would need to be rehomed. Why do they HAVE to move in for the holidays? Is there some detail we\u2019re missing? Also curious if they can just make some kind of arrangement for the time being where Tycho is just kept away from the kid? In a other room or out in the yard depending on where the kid is?", "NAH. \n\nThis was a tough one. What I\u2019m staking my judgement on is Ben\u2019s autism. People on the spectrum struggle with change and fears differently than those that aren\u2019t neurodivergent. Ben very well may never be able to simply adjust to living with a dog like you or I. \n\nYour dad is trying to build a family and still include you. It\u2019s a difficult situation all around. Is there any way you can find a temporary home until you go to college? Have you looked into potential fosters?", "NTA. Your dad is being an asshole.", "I think it\u2019s something to do with her lease or something, I don\u2019t know.  Maybe also having time to move.  My dad just said that it would be a lot more trouble and expense to wait.", "\u201cIt just takes time\u201d while a young kid is afraid of the animal in the same house as him? That\u2019s not a solution either.\n\nThe solution is to wait until OP moves out since that can be within a year.", "The dad can still date and hang out with his fiance. He has a responsibility to his daughter and dog that he got her. She can move in later and the fact she's rethinking the engagement cause his daughter doesn't want to get rid of her dog is a red flag and manipulative of her.", "Dad isn\u2019t allowed to put his new family ahead of what\u2019s good for his existing family.\n\nI mean, he\u2019s legally allowed to. But it makes him TA.\n\nWe\u2019re not talking about them splitting up. Just waiting a few months for the sake of his daughter. They\u2019re both adults and both parents\u2014they should be able to see the sense in that.", "That seems really harsh. Sometimes the way people communicate comes off like they don't care but he may normally love and care for OP deeply.\nTo just cut him off in the heat of the moment seems too far.", "His dad\u2019s feelings that a dog is disposable are not valid. Dogs are not given up lightly and dad should have thought through AT LEAST the timing given OP\u2019s age. It\u2019s not *all* about the romantic relationship and its natural pace. He\u2019s a father and has responsibilities, and a dog is a commitment, not just a plaything.", "Nope, OPs dad is definitely the AH here. \n\nNTA", "The dad is being ridiculous! This is not a life or death situation where the kid is fatally allergic to the dog or the dog has attempted to bite this kids face off. Also why does the step mom need to move in on this specific timeline? Will she be evicted from her home and made to live on the streets if they don\u2019t move in over the holidays? I doubt it. I get the dad wanting to save money and live with his fianc\u00e9, but it\u2019s not all about him and the fianc\u00e9. They have made no effort to compromise and are making plans that are convenient to them while screwing over OP", "I was thinking they should bring in a therapist to work with acclimating Ben and Tycho.  But I don't think the answer is to automatically get rid of the dog!", "this is such a gross take. Why is it on a 17 year old to fix this situation?", "Uh her dad already has family. He isn\u2019t doing his own daughter a favor for trying to \u201cstill include her\u201d ffs she\u2019s his daughter and they live together.", "But then it's so easy for his mother to make a move with Ben!? And he is supposed to live from one day to the next in a completely new area, house and room? With two other people he doesn't know well. That's going to be the real horror for him as an autistic person. But OP's dad and stepmother have no problem with that....\nMaybe Ben was just anxious about the environment and not the dog.", "Gotcha. I think you need to have an honest conversation with your dad and ask him if he is willing to deal with that added hassle for the sake of your relationship. His stance on this seems very callous.", "And that\u2019s just it would be more trouble and expense to wait. But it\u2019s still possible to wait. Sometimes we have to do things as adults that are more expensive and time-consuming than the ideally would like. NTA", "What a lame excuse. Basically it\u2019s just about convenience. Then saving some money and not going through the trouble of waiting is more important than allowing you to keep you dog. Omg your dad really sucks.", "Yes, Dad.  Being a grown up means being patient and staying true to your commitments.  Sorry you are in this situation.  I hate to suggest this but you might want to start looking for a temporary home for Tycho.  Many schools require freshmen to live in the dorms, and dogs can't live in a dorm.  If you can find a friend or relative to foster him, you paying for his support and visiting him often, might be a difficult but doable plan.", "i don\u2019t disagree with anything you\u2019re saying. i\u2019m mostly just heartbroken about the situation.", "i\u2019m just trying to be sensitive to the situation. dad is in love and it\u2019s important to him. it\u2019s important to consider the mental health and well-being of the autistic child as well. nobody is trying to be a dick here. i feel bad for both OP and the soon-to-be step brother.", "Autism can be really weird, and it might be entirely possible that having a dog is indeed too stimulating. That being said, it is true that the stepmother could wait till spring.", "Sure, he might not be TRYING to be one. Unfortunately, he is. It is a tough spot, but the solution he settled on was a bad one.", "Yeah it\u2019s important to him to have them move in but OP is trying to say that dad can\u2019t EVER live with his fianc\u00e9 and her kid she\u2019s asking them to wait a few months so that she doesn\u2019t have to get rid of her dog??? \n\nDad and step-mom are being insanely selfish right now. Unless the fianc\u00e9 and kid are going to be evicted and homeless UNLESS they move in over the holidays, I don\u2019t really understand why they can\u2019t just wait in order to keep the peace and not royally screw over OP. That\u2019s not a very good way to start a blended family if you ask me.", "Yeah I completely understand that. I think the thing that\u2019s getting to me is the insistence that they need to move in now. OP responded to another comment that the reasoning for them moving in sooner is to save money and because it will be more \u201ctrouble\u201d if they wait. I\u2019m sorry, but so what? Saving money and having things be more convenient is not a valid excuse to get rid of his daughters pet. Dad needs to suck it up and realize that not everything can go his way when he has a daughter to think about. Blending families is tough and it can go SO wrong it\u2019s just such a bad move for the dad to do this and start off on the wrong foot. How can he expect OP to want to be involved in this new family when they\u2019re putting her through something like this?", "completely agreed", "I don't think this family will ever actually blend.  Dad doesn't care about her feelings, it's all about his new life and making sure it goes the way he wants.  This is not an uncommon pattern and I suspect that even without the dog as an issue, she would be last and least going forward.  That he is being so callous about the dog is very telling.  She needs to just get ready to go out on her own with Tycho."]}
