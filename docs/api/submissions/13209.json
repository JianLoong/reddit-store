Your GF\u2019s family are treating you as one of their own!  You may not get why they love their doggo so much but they think you love your cat they same way they love their dog.  It\u2019s weird to you but they are doing their best to show you they care by turning those screenshots into pics.", "Kinda, but I'd go with NAH.  \n\n\nDifferent generations do different shit that looks weird to others. Just accept it and move on.", "I think it was an adorable gift and she's putting you at the same level as her daughter. She's calling you her son.", "A true cat person would never even question a gift like that and would be thrilled. My husband and I have framed pictures of our cats all over the house. \ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude3b\n\nThat said,  YTA, who would it hurt to be grateful for the effort she put in? She obviously is the kind of person who treats animals like the family they are, she wanted to show she cared about you and yours.", "YTA. I\u2019m not gonna lie, I agree that\u2019s a super weird gift. But if you treat people like crap when they\u2019re trying to be nice to you, they will either stop being nice or stop being in your life.", "YTA based on the rudeness and judgmental tone of OP's post. It's not weird for people to have photos of their pets even if it's not OP's taste. TBH entire post comes across as girlfriend and family are the type to dote on pets and view them as beloved family members and assume others do too and OP's the type who more or less just let's an animal hang around and occasionally acknowledges it.", "NTA. Its your cat and your place, if you dont want pictures of your cat on the wall why should you have to have it there? Although I don\u2019t really see a problem having a picture or two framed of your pets, I think it\u2019s just a bit unreasonable of her to assume you wanted it in the first place. Then again, I\u2019m sure with how she treats her dog (how you put it at least), her hearing your stance on putting up pictures of your cat probably got to her a little bit.", "i\u2019m gonna go with nta.\n\npersonally i dont get why it\u2019s weird, i have so many pictures of my dogs and have considered framing some. but you weren\u2019t an ah about it in the slightest and it\u2019s just ur opinion anyway", "ESH \nYou could have used a nicer tone with your gf, sounds like. Maybe explaining that it wasn't your style. \nThe gift is hella weird tho so I would have also had a negative reaction.", "NTA, it\u2019s okay to not be crazy about a gift even if it\u2019s given with the best of intentions. Maybe get some kind of photo album to put the pics in instead of having them framed? that way you still have the gift, but you don\u2019t have a wall shrine to your cat.", "NTA you don't say you were ungrateful you said you thought it was kinda weird. she also asked you what you thought & you just told her the truth.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I am also very minimalist. I don\u2019t put much on my walls. I have one framed picture of my family and that is it.", "ESH - I have a oil canvas of my dog dressed as a Frenchman lmao", "NAH \n\nits weird. Nobody is an asshole though.", "Nta I mean 12 frames photos is weird.. if it was one that be normal but 12 is kinda obsessive", "YTA. They love their dog a lot, so naturally they\u2019re going to assume you love your cat the same. They genuinely thought you would really love some pictures of your pet, just as they would. They gave you a gift that clearly had a lot of thought put into it and they thought you would like it. You don\u2019t have to love your pet at the same level as them or even like the gift, but not appreciating the thought put into it and calling it weird is extremely rude.", "Yeah I agree with all these points. You might not like the decor option of having loads of pet pictures up on the wall but the point is these gifts are a way of bonding with family", "But does he really have to put them up in his house? And stare at every day? It makes him a jerk to want to decorate his house how he wants too?", "Guess I should have clarified a bit more. I'm talking a wall. With over a dozen framed photos of only the cat and dog.  There are more pictures of the animals on that one wall than there are of us in the whole house", "What's the opposite of ESH? I think everybody had good intentions; they just didn't execute it well\n\n\u2022 The mom, was trying to be nice, giving a gift that maybe she didn't think so much about what the other person would like as much as she thought about what SHE would like\n\n\u2022 The girlfriend, who apparently DID like the gifts, was honoring her mother by putting the pictures in a place of honor in the home\n\n\u2022 The boyfriend, was weirded out by it all and spoke his mind. We don't know that he was using a harsh tone about it. You could say that you're weirded out in a nice way. Probably better words could have been used, but still\n\nI just don't think anybody here sucks, because they all had good intentions", "He can always take the pics down tomorrow :)", "No, the way he said it and that he called it weird made him a jerk. What would it have hurt for him to say that he appreciates the thought from both of them (gf and gf mom) but he's not a fan of all the photos on the wall? There are ways to say you don't like something without being rude and/or calling a person's thoughtful gift weird.", "Ehh that's personal preference. I don't have any pictures of myself in my house, but I do have some of my pets.", "The opposite is NAH = no assholes here!", "Except he asked why she even bothered, which is harsh and the answer is obvious and nice. So because of that, YTA"]}
