GIANT red flags with this dude", "NTA\n\ndo you like the abuse or have you justified it that he loves you ?", "ESH- your husband sounds like he is a total AH, so don't get me wrong, but you are way too old to be tattling to mommy and daddy and bringing them into your fights.  Next time he threatens to throw you out, leave and go to your parents. That's the appropriate action for an adult who needs support.", "NTA but your husband is financially abusing you and you should be putting a stop to this yourself, not needing to draw both your parents in to feel safe and make him behave.", "NTA if dude wants to have an opinion on finances, then he can contribute to them.", "NTA\n\nYou are in an abusive relationship.", "Your husband seems abusive. Financially from this post, and emotionally and verbally from your other posts.  He makes you feel like you are doing things wrong, consults with his parents, instead of you on financial issues, takes your money, then argues with you when you make a decision on your own.  You seem to be questioning yourself, but the decision you should be questioning is should you stay married.", "You\u2019re nearly 30 years old and you tattled on your husband to your parents?\n\nYTA", "Nta but it's time for him to get a job. It's time for you to get a savings account and save half your money if possible. Your husband is a leech, I'd ask you to think long and hard about your life and if this is what you want for the next 70-80 years.", "If you pay for most everything, where does all his money go? Is it sitting in the bank, or is he spending it on something? There's no reason for you to bear all of the financial burden when both of you have jobs.\n\nNTA.\n\nDivorce this abusive asshole.", "Separate your finances ASAP. Honestly this man is just using you for your money.", "NTA. And I agree with others saying he's abusive.  Were it me, I would not stand for that kind of behavior.", "YTA, the story isn't making much sense, you literally say he has a paycheck so why would you be supporting him financially 100 percent. \n\nThat aside, he as a point. You're adults, you're married. Don't go taddling to mommy and daddy and solve your own problems.", "He is no good. Stop giving him your checks. Don't be afraid of him.", "NTA. If you are paying all this then why does he think he has the right to berate you? he shouldn't in any case, but the fact that you give him your salary is very disturbing.\n\nI know Reddit is quick to jump in the divorce bandwagon, but please look at how he's treating you. Get some counseling, financial, legal and emotional.", "He is fiancially abusive and that will be only the beginning.  Run, now!", "You went to Bali on a single income??? Sounds like you\u2019re both at fault here.", "You\u2019re a grown up. Grown ups don\u2019t call mommy and daddy to handle a marital dispute. \n\nYTA.", "NTA - He was very out of line to threaten to throw you out. It was probably an empty threat since he\u2019s mooching so much off of you, I don\u2019t he\u2019d want to throw out the breadwinner. But he\u2019s taking advantage of you and thinks he can get away with making these threats, blowing up at you, and generally being abusive.\n\nIf your parents are supportive, please consider moving in with them and getting your financial situation taken care of. You are still very young and don\u2019t deserve to be tied down to an abusive man. He is like this after not even a full year of marriage; he\u2019s not going to get better.", "NTA - Everything you have described above is financial abuse.\n\nHe does not want you to tell people because he knows he is wrong.", "You\u2019re being abused", "NTA. You did the right thing. Sometimes you have to bring in people who love both of you to help when it gets this bad. He needs some accountability and hopefully now he gets it.", "I guess you\u2019d reached the cry for help point of this new marriage. You can only do that once, and only in a real crisis. I hope this works out for you.", "NTA for seeing this as a controlling/abusive problem and reaching out to family for help and safety. In a healthy relationship I wouldn\u2019t support calling everyone to gossip about the partner.", "It sounds like you have a bigger problem. Your husband is a leech and shouldn\u2019t be controlling you like that. Please look into why you allow this behavior.", "NTA.  Set up a separate account at a different bank from any joint account or any of his accounts.  You should not be fully supporting him when he has a full-time job.  That is just abusive and you need to get out.\n\nStay in contact with your parents and make a plan.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He\u2019s almost 30 & youre the younger one! Who makes more money? The fact that he went ape/shit over you sensing your own money to your brother is worrying. Your husband is financially abusive - please set firm boundaries/divorce if feel unsafe."]}
