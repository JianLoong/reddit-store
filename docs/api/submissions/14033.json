It's never too late until its too late.", "NTA\n\nYour mom had no problem playing the blame game until it stopped playing out in her favor. She had no reservation with shaming someone over their past, but you're somehow \"cruel\" for even remotely speaking about hers.\n\nShe needs to move out of that shiny glass house if she wants to throw stones around.", "NTA\n\nShe threw the past in his face the same way she's accusing you of.", "NTA\n\nIf your dad was turned into a \u201cbeast of burden\u201d husband, then there may not have been much left of him after work emotionally. It happened to me with my oldest son. During those years I was busy earning money for my addict ex-wife as well.\n\nToo bad, because I did want to be closer to my son. We still talk occasionally, but we never got to be as close as I was with my dad. One of my many regrets. \n\nIt isn\u2019t too late to try.", "NTA but you're putting too much responsibility on how your relationship turned out with your dad on yourself. You were a kid, it was his job to take care of you and reach out, you can't expect a kid to meet an adult man on his level or take up his interests. He chose to enable your mother instead of bond with you. He's a grown up and a father, he should have been the one to make the real effort. You have a chance now to change things if you want to, but I think you're accepting too much blame yourself.", "NTA  You\u2019re navigating a horrible situation with an addict mother and a father who I guess just can\u2019t connect with you?  I\u2019d like to believe what you wrote about your father working all the time to support addict mom, but somehow dad bonded with brother?  I wish you a time machine that deposits you on the other side of this nightmare.", "NTA.\n\nBut your dad is 100% to blame for your lack of bonding. It is not incumbent upon you, the child, to find common interests with your father so that he shows interest. It is his responsibility as the parent to find common interest with you, or to at least fake interest in your passions. You have no blame regarding your lack of a relationship. He is simply a bad father.", "NTA \n\nYou told her the truth.\n\nSometimes the truth sucks.\n\nYour mother found that out the hard way.\n\nI'm sorry both your parents sucked but so did mine and I turned out okay, your will too x", "YTA\n\nYour dad's actions are his own. He chose to leave you with an addict mother rather than stepping in to take care of you as your parent.", "NTA stay away from your mother.

It sounds like you shared a little bit of truth with her and it hurt her feelings. Which is understandable. Parents realizing they fucked up, especially when it specifically comes from the mouth of the person they failed, is painful. \n\nBut if I go by just your description, it doesn't sound like you were saying it to her with malicious intent to hurt her. It just sounds like you communicated honestly with her.\n\nAlso, if she \"didn't want the past thrown in her face\" she shouldn't weaponize other people's past against them. She acted Hypocritical and then painted herself to be the victim to people who weren't there to witness it.", "NTA", "We live four hours apart and tbh I love my dad but I'm sick of trying, I tried not a lot as a kid but I'll say the last few years I tried HARD to build something, we just don't have anything in common and that's ok, still trying though", "My brother got interested in our dad's industry, they ended up working together and briefly ran a shop together, I meanwhile have no such common ground", "What? \n\nHe worked hard to provide for his family and her addiction because she didn't want to work and wouldn't seek help for what her addiction was. The father didn't leave his family, he was working too much to be able to connect properly with his son. Because his wife was a deadbeat mother......", "The fuck you mean, he worked 80+ hours a week for our family", "Any explanation or....?", "It wasn\u2019t your job to try when you were a kid.

Hang in there, it\u2019s going to get better as you make good decisions through your life.\n\nETA - I didn\u2019t mean it\u2019s sad the brother connected, it\u2019s sad that OP hasn\u2019t yet connected.   Guess I could have phrased that clearer.  Clarified above language.  It\u2019s all love for OP", "I\u2019m curious how he was able to create a strong relationship with OPs brother, then. I agree OP is NTA, but \u201che had to spend so much time away from the family providing while his wife wouldn\u2019t work in her addiction\u201d isn\u2019t an excuse for why he invested interest in a relationship with one child and not the other.", "He also chose not to engage with you. And he chose to let his money go to your mom's addiction rather than fighting that or leaving and fighting for custody. Your mom was shitty for sure, but she's not responsible for your dad's choices to be absent and enabling.", "Agree, I think OP is definitely NTA and has a point about his Mom, but from what I\u2019m reading it seems like Dad was no prize either.  He doesn\u2019t seem to have much interest in a relationship.", "Uhm.... Ok?", "Uh, what?", "My brither ended up getting a job in the same industry, they briefly started a business together even", "YTA, sorry but you\u2019re too old to blame your mum for your dad\u2019s actions. He stayed at work and left you with your mum. Plenty of parents that work ungodly hours to provide for their kids and yet have a loving relationship with their children - your Dad isn\u2019t one of them.", "YTA\n\nSorry to break to you, if your father wanted a relationship with you he would bother to do so. That's not up to no one else. Your mother's addiction is even more of a reason to do so... he just didn't want to.", "I feel like that comment was meant for a totally different post (happened to me yesterday) or they are not good at English.", "My dad worked 80+ hrs a week to provide for my family too but all 4 of us have a great relationship with our Dad. He put in the effort to know us and we all have a great relationship with our Dad now in our 30's. In turn however my Mom was a great sahm making his sacrifice worthwhile. (Which is why I'd say ESH but you the least, I just think your blame is a little misplaced)"]}
