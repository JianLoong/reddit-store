I pointed out a lot of things that were brought up in the comments and presented them as the concerns of me and a couple of friends of mine, and not the concerns of the millions that saw it online. Turns out, she was part of those millions. Someone sent her one of tiktoks that my Reddit post was read in and she has been thinking about things.\n\nShe told me she felt a little embarrassed about this all being out there online, even if nobody knew who we are, and I apologized. I explained that I really didn\u2019t have many people who weren\u2019t involved in the wedding to speak with about this, and I needed the advice. She also apologized, and said that she realizes now that the bleaching was a completely out of line request. She said that since she\u2019s only bleached her hair once, and because she\u2019s naturally blonde to begin with, she didn\u2019t know anything about the process for bleaching dark hair and didn\u2019t know it would be so difficult, take so long, and could cause so much damage. She said looking back knowing what she knows now, she feels like she was a huge bitch. I reassured her that she wasn\u2019t a bitch, she was just uneducated and passionate about something, and we clashed. We hugged it out, and things are good now.\n\nAbout the wigs, there will be none. She\u2019s scrapping the group blonde idea. I convinced her that she would stand out far better if her whole bridal party wasn\u2019t blonde and that dark hair (and red hair) would work amazingly with her winter theme. The contacts are also being scrapped unless any of us decide we want to use theme. They\u2019re a very piercing blue and kind of cool looking.\n\nAbout the grandparents, Zoe said Frank\u2019s family in Argentina isn\u2019t of German descent, so nothing to wonder or argue about. She was however horrified when she put all those pieces together and thought about how it looked. She had really been thinking Elsa vibes, not Aryan Nation vibes, and that embarrassed her more than the story being out there by itself. She didn\u2019t even know Nazis fled to South America after WWII.\n\nZoe has officially messaged everyone in the bridal party to let them know about the change of plans and to apologize for the outburst and the stress this put on everyone. She\u2019s also very excited for us all to come up with a new hair/makeup look and to go dress shopping. Also, those who asked if the groomsmen were being held to the same standard, I don\u2019t know, and after finally getting this whole fiasco over with, I didn\u2019t care to ask. \n\nZoe and I have made up and everything\u2019s fine now. Sorry if this update wasn\u2019t the crazy story everyone was looking forward to!", "created_utc": 1695844125, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16tu28w/update_aita_for_refusing_to_bleach_my_hair_for_a/", "score": 993, "replies": ["Okay, I\u2019m SO glad I nailed the Elsa vibes. Also, I love that you came back with an update. \n\nThis was fun. I\u2019m glad you got to clear stuff up. I hope you have a blast at the wedding.", ">Sorry if this update wasn\u2019t the crazy story everyone was looking forward to!\n\nAbsolutely nothing to apologize for. Genuinely positive outcomes are always better for the universe and those in it than another thing to get riled up about. There's enough bullshit and rage out there.", "To be honest, these are the kind of updates I love. People talking it out and becomeing better after hearing other perspectives is why I'm here! We weren't screaming into the void, we helped :)", "I did not get Nazi vibes, but I can see where people got that. Wow! I'm glad you had a great end result.", "Wonderful! Happy wedding to her !", "[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16lzpid/aita_for_refusing_to_bleach_my_hair_for_a_wedding/)", "Good on Zoe, being a bride brings out a weird side we didn't know we had. I'm glad she took in the criticism.", "If she still wants the Frozen/Elsa thing, the bridal party could have their hair braided. If it\u2019s too short, then small accent braids. \n\nIt\u2019s nice to see a bride listen to her friends and apologize.", "Look, at least she was horrified at it reasonably coming off as a white supremacy schtick, but the fact that it didn\u2019t occur to her before is kinda scary.", "No, this is the sort of update I like to hear. OK, yes, I do like the even more crazy ones also. But it's nice to hear that people talked it out and acted reasonably and everyone is back to being friends.  And it sounds like it's going to be a beautiful wedding. Besides, Elsa's best friend/sister is Anna, right?", "Perfect resolution, I'm so happy she heard the post on Tic Tock!!  Bonus!", "Yay love a positive update! No bridezillas here", "I'm glad she backed down. Blue contacts look kind of bizarre on brown eyes, anyway. It's more distracting than anything.", "Ah, maturity.\n\nWhat a rare commodity.", "I love it when a plan comes together", "So happy about the positive update! It's great, when people are willing to learn new things, admit when they are wrong and change their actions accordingly! \ud83d\ude0a", "Best uptade ever!", "Yay!! I love happy endings! And they're rare as hens teeth around here.", "What a lovely update! I hope your friend has a lovely wedding and I hope you have a great time!", "Such a lovely happy ending (better happy than crazy!)! I'm really glad everything worked out for all of you!!!", "I hope she thinks a lot harder about demanding things from people who care about her from now on. This was a good way to put a wedge into her closest friendships. Keep it in perspective, Zoe. Even without the Nazi implications it\u2019s a shitty thing to do to your friends and family.", "That's great update because you both worked out so well without fireworks, fights and all the work. Even storm out of the room in a huff.  LOL I'm glad that Zoe saw what she had done and scrapped everything off and start afresh.  \n\nGood Luck.....", "This update is the best. Much better than a crazy blow-up!", "Love the update and love that you and Zoe had a real honest communication and resolved the issue. Very mature and commendable.", "Frankly Zoe sounds like a victim of the US education system coupled with a lack of common sense.", "I want to know what she decided about the contacts! I hope she saw the error of her judgement there as well.  Making people wear tinted contacts is as bad as suggesting you all be blondes.", "I sure hope nobody had already bleached their hair", "You could wear the blonde wigs for the bachelorette party or a girls night out", "Oh so happy for all of you.  Have fun", "Great update, glad this worked out bc that was ludicrous", "Sounds like a great update to me!", "I'm so glad you were able to make up and that Zoe was mature enough to apologize and realize she made a mistake. It sounds like you both have a good friend in each other. Have fun at the wedding, sounds like it will be beautiful.", "you are a good friend to have", "My first thought was of a certain dictator that wanted everyone to be blonde with blue eyes as well", "> Zoe and I have made up and everything\u2019s fine now. Sorry if this update wasn\u2019t the crazy story everyone was looking forward to!\n\n Look, I love a good trainwreck story as much as the next person, but these are the updates that actually feel good to read. I\u2019m glad you guys were able to work it out in an adult manner. I hope the wedding goes great for everyone!", "Wonderful!", "That's a really nice update.", "Yay! A happy ending on AITAH. I't's nice to see some people can listen to reason.", "Same! I know most of the appeal of this place is making judgements on various situations of the lives of strangers, but it is nice when people resolve their differences too.", "Haha my first thought was Elsa too when read blue dress, blond hair lol", "I prefer these outcomes tbh.  Communication is the best!   And when people admit mistakes and genuinely apologize?  Amazing", "It's a very dumb trope, that since many Nazi led to Argentina to hide after WWII, then every white person tha comes from Argentina must be a Nazi descendant, because after all \"everyone knows that Latinos are all dark\".\n\nThey are utterly ignorant that most of Argentina's population, and virtually all of if from the middle class up, is white because the Spanish conquerors and the waves of Spanish, Italian and German immigrants in the 19th century did as good a job of getting rid of the native population as in the USA.", "STOP SNITCHING", "I have learned from dating my new boyfriend and meeting his parents that white people who grew up exclusively around other white people can be amazingly sheltered. It\u2019s like a whole other level of privilege honestly.", "Heartwarming! Mad respect for Zoe, honestly. I think nearly everyone gets overly fixated on a specific \"vision\" or goal sometimes and it can be hard to loosen your grip on that, admit you're wrong and apologize. This update gave me trauma flashbacks, truthfully, because it reminded of the fight that *finally* broke my abusive ex-best-friend's hold on me. I suggested that something she said made her *sound* uneducated, which resulted in a screaming, cursing, hate-filled diatribe lasting more than an hour. \n\nMeanwhile, in sane adults who respect each other land, OP can tell Zoe she *was* uneducated and she gracefully accepts the criticism and gives OP a hug. This wholesomeness helped heal my heart a little, I think. Decent, trying-to-be-kind, self-aware people do exist!", "Some of the full blooded Germans in my family are darker than some of the Mexicans in my family...there's a whole range of shades in here. \n\nThe trope may be dumb and folks in this sitjation may have pulled it from their butts...but they didn't pull it totally out of thin air. This is Reddit. Folks will be looking for outlandish reasonings behing things.", "I mean, regardless of where your family is from, \"all blonde and blue-eyed\" is an extremely suspicious wedding theme.", "That would be surprising since Argentina is like 85% white.", ">They are utterly ignorant that most of Argentina's population, and virtually all of if from the middle class up, is white because the Spanish conquerors \n\nThey are unaware that a lot of Spaniards went to South America? How do they explain many people speaking Spanish there then?", "Lol yeah it's just people who know nothing about Argentina. \n\nA reason the Nazis went here is that there were already German communities etc already there.....", "It was more of the \u201cdemanding everyone be blonde and blue eyed for the photos\u201d than stereotyping the skin color of Argentinians", "Lol", "Yes! It's actually a core problem IMO. Hiding (anything but cartoonishly bad) racism from the kids that don't experience it doesn't protect your kids, it just entrenches the subtle racism that is the major problem in society.\n\nI honestly think kids can learn about these topics from a pretty young age without feeling attacked or personally responsible, but their *parents* can't handle it. Sigh.", "It's the case. I didn't know that cracker could refer to a white person until I was in college lmao", "I wouldn't go that far but in Buenos Aires, sure might be around that. The rest of the country is far more mixed.", "Spanish? They speak Mexican obviously", "I got that number from Wikipedia."]}
