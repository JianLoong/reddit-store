My husband was out so it was just me and my daughter (3). One of my friends \u201cSandy\u201d (33) is childfree and gets very upset when children act up in public. She typically avoids coming over when my daughter is home, but we are going on vacation soon and she has a trip planned immediately after we get back, so this would be the last time we have a chance to catch up for a while.\n\nI had my daughter stay up in her room for the most part, but at one point she came down to get a snack. She has a favorite bowl and requested that bowl, so I got it for her and set it down on the table while I got the rest of her snack together. Sandy decided it would be funny to take the bowl and hold it out of her reach while I was in the pantry, and I came out when I heard my daughter start to get upset. Sandy was laughing and my daughter looked like she was about to cry, so I asked Sandy to please set the bowl down and not do that again. Sandy said that it was just a bowl and it was funny how upset she was getting over it, and that she could either eat out of another bowl or ask politely instead of whining. My daughter got really upset at that and started to cry and scream. Sandy clearly didn\u2019t expect that reaction and looked at me with a sort of shocked face to see what I was going to do.I took the bowl from her and gave it to my daughter, gave her a hug, then told her to go upstairs and play for a bit and I\u2019d give her her snack when she was calm enough to eat it so that I could deal with the situation while she was out of earshot.\n\nSandy asked me if I was serious in letting my child act like that knowing that she hated children\u2019s tantrums. I asked her why she would provoke my daughter in the first place, to which she replied that it she didn\u2019t expect such a big reaction and there\u2019s no reason for her to scream like that over a bowl, and that my daughter was acting like a brat in front of company and I should have disciplined her. Sandy left soon after. Most of my friends agree with me that Sandy F\u2019d around and found out, but Sandy still thinks I should have disciplined my daughter for having such a dramatic reaction to a minor issue, especially knowing that she gets so upset when children act out. I also definitely believe that Sandy didn\u2019t know my daughter would throw a tantrum and wouldn\u2019t have done it otherwise, because she doesn\u2019t know much about children and what can set them off and she hates tantrums and would never cause one on purpose. AITA?\n\nEdit: To be clear, Sandy has never exhibited this behavior in front of me before. Obviously I wouldn't bring someone near my daughter that I knew finds joy in her pain and Sandy will not be coming to my house again.", "created_utc": 1687017529, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14bul0l/aita_for_letting_my_child_throw_a_tantrum_over_a/", "score": 521, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not okay to go around being mean to children.", "Sandy clearly found your daughter\u2019s emotional distress obvious (and expected?) enough to find it funny/get joy out of upsetting your daughter.

Every 3 year old in the world is gonna react like that. It was an appropriate reaction given her age. Your response to impose no discipline except saying she could have snack when she was calmer was also entirely appropriate. Sandy is just wrong entirely in this situation.", "NTA, but Sandy sure is. At this point, I would honestly reconsider the friendship. What Sandy did wasn't a joke. She was casually cruel to a toddler - on purpose.", "NTA, I can't say the same for Sandy who thought it was funny to basically bully a three year old and then get pissy when she didn't like the reaction she got.", "NTA but I don't understand why you're friends with Sandy.

NTA unless you let that creature around your kid ever again! Otherwise I would suspect you might be truly evil!", "I don't like bratty children, but in this case, the child was provoked by an alleged adult for giggles.

I don't act so freaking self entitled like your friend was being. She is so very dense, it's unbelievable. Acting like a bully to a child and being surprised when they react accordingly? Ffs.

Tantrums are just a fact of life with toddlers, until they can learn to handle their emotions.", "NTA\n\nWhy are you going to punish your kid because of someone else's actions? That's dumb.

Sandy is a huge asshole for taunting and mocking a small child and then thinking this child should be punished for their completely natural and age-appropriate response.  \n\nSandy is a malicious person, and I would seriously re-think a friendship with her.", "So, your friend intentionally bullied your daughter, taunted her, then criticized you for not disciplining your child after she caused your child distress, and you\u2019re questioning if she did it unintentionally because you \u201cdefinitely believe Sandy didn\u2019t know my daughter\u2026.she doesn\u2019t know much about children\u201d\u2026??? \n\nYou\u2019re verging on being TA for thinking she \u201cdidn\u2019t know\u201d. Your child is a human with feelings like the rest of us. It doesn\u2019t take a parent to know what Sandy was doing was wrong.

OP, I edited this for you:\n\nSandy-a full grown adult-acted like a toddler to an actual toddler then threw a tantrum because the toddler threw a tantrum. Adult-toddler says parent of actual toddler should have disciplined actual toddler because adult-toddler doesn\u2019t like tantrums.", "That's not a friend.

I would recommend jettisoning her out of your life.", "ESH except your daughter. You are an AH for exposing your kid to someone like Sandy. Sandy isnt child free. She is an entitled child hater who thins she has the rivjt to mess with your parenting.

Sandy is self professed child free which is normally not an issue, but she\u2019s truly crossed the line to be a literal child hater.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t usually come over when your daughter is home.

Such an AH behaviour that she dares to deflect on an innocent kid. NTA, glad you were there for your kid.", "NTA Sandy is horrible. I would have kicked her out for intentionally upsetting a little 3 year old.", "So I don\u2019t have kids. I don\u2019t want kids. I\u2019m not really all that crazy about kids in general.

NTA", "ESH\n\nSandy is mean (I would almost say sadistic about her insistence that you punish your daughter) and should not be allowed around children, or decent people.  \n\nBut, you told your 3 y.o. to stay in her room for the duration of Sandy\u2019s visit.  That disturbs me on a couple of levels.  She\u2019s three, your home is her safe space.  She should not be blocked from its common areas.", "Yeah bullying a 3 year old and provoking her to laugh at her reaction, and then turning around and wanting the kid she's bullying to be punished for it? That's a common enough behaviour in, like, other 3 year olds. Your friend isn't childfree if she's an overgrown child herself. Your daughter was probably shocked at being treated that way by a grown adult, I don't blame her for getting upset! \n\nYWBTA if you keep this woman on as a friend.", "Look, I'm childfree and don't really like most children, but there is NOTHING ok about what this 'friend' of yours did.\n\nTaunting children is sadistic and abusive.

I have a strong feeling your friend thinks she could parent better than everyone even though she doesn\u2019t have kids and was trying to win points in a game you didn\u2019t even know you were playing.

Or something to that effect. I honestly don\u2019t think it matters that she hasn\u2019t acted this way before when you said you rarely include her when your child or other children are present. This is a Sandy problem and you were just her choice subject to inflict her misplaced holiness. She isn\u2019t a good friend and probably not even a good person.

Everyone jokes around with kids and teases them. That's not what this was. It's only a joke if everyone is having fun, including the kid. As soon as the kid is no longer having fun but is now distressed by the joke, it's not longer a joke. It is someone hurting your kid for fun. \n\nI would have shamed the fuck out of Sandy for doing that. My daughter is a human being, not a prop for other people to play with. I know you feel that way too but it doesn't sound like you made that clear in the moment to your daughter. \n\nA three-year-old is learning how social interactions work and I would have used that moment to teach her a couple things. First, that I always have her back by immediately and sternly shutting down the whole \"joke.\" It sounds like you did this decently well but I would have gone further by showing her that this kind of behavior towards her is not acceptable. Your daughter did nothing wrong and someone treating her like this is not just a harmless prank but completely unacceptable bullying.\n\nSecond, I would have modeled the correct behavior toward bullies, which is to create consequences for their behavior. I would have first shamed her in front of everyone else and made sure that everyone in the friend group saw how Sandy betrayed your trust by treating a defenseless child as a thing and not a person. A thing that she used for her own enjoyment without thought of the impact on the other person. If Sandy didn't immediately realize that she was wrong and apologize to both me and my daughter, then I would have politely asked her to leave. If she doubled down like it sounds like Sandy did in your situation, then the second time I asked would not be as polite. \n\nThird, I would apologize to my daughter myself, regardless of how Sandy responded to my reaction. I would genuinely feel terrible that I brought a person around her that would make her so upset just because it was funny.

Sandy is the latter.  \n\nShe doesn't deserve to be in your lives.  I'm childfree but majority of my friends/siblings have kids.

This human sucks. NTA but why are you friends with her?", "To put it in a better way... It feels like Sandy was the one throwing a Childish tantrum for not being let off scot-free for bullying a child.\n\nAnd honestly it was quite a dumb thing for Sandy to do. If you don't like crying children, don't do stuff that can make them cry. Even a child understands this.", "I'm so glad Sandy is child free", "Should have disciplined Sandy lol\n\nSo true though. If it was two kids and one took the bowl from the other making them cry, the crying kid should be the one  disciplined?", "I\u2019m childfree-adjacent and it took a while but I realized a lot of these childfree people are genuine narcissists or psychopaths who don\u2019t like children taking attention away from them or being allowed to do things they can\u2019t.\n\nETA: by childfree-adjacent I mean that I don\u2019t have children, don\u2019t think I want them, could be convinced otherwise, but truly wish having children wasn\u2019t see as the default.

Many!) people over at arrrchildfree need genuine help.", "Exactly children have no way of processing big emotions so they cry and \u201cthrow a tantrum\u201d some adults really need to learn how to be patient with kids.", "NTA.

Not wanting children is normal and reasonable. Not being particularly fond of children or feeling awkward them is totally fine. Hating children is weird and creepy.", "Right? I'm childfree, don't spend much time around kids, but they're human beings and not having any doesn't mean I can't be kind and respectful to the ones I meet. Sandy was getting her kicks being nasty to a person she could physically overpower. That's pretty vile.", "Yeah, that behaviour doesn't really have much to do with her being childfree, she's just an AH. I don't ever want children but I'm perfectly fine being the funny aunt to my friends'.

Most of the questions where the person is obviously NTA are like that. It always happens to me. I wonder if I\u2019m crazy or the other person is lmao. \n\nClearly that woman was behaving in a way that\u2019s childish, horrible, and borderline psychotic, excepting  the idea that she thinks children are little adults and should always behave that way. \n\nEither way, she\u2019s quite clearly an asshole. A huge asshole and a bully.

Fuck sandy.", "Exactly. This has nothing to do with being child free. Sandy is just a Bad Person.", "This. 3 yr olds will act up if you torment them.

I hope she hasn't done anything wirse to OPs child whilst she wasn't looking", "Amen.", "Exactly! I'm childfree too, but every person has to know that if you take away from a child their favourite thing, they are going to be upset. And how do children express their frustration? By screaming. And why? Becouse they are children and don't know how else react. I don't understand how can she expect a 3 years old kid to react better. Don't want child screaming?

So much about this was just completely unrealistic", "Fr- they'd just get offended or something lol", "She\u2019s an AH for even considering Sandy\u2019s child free feelings as reasons for her actions.", "Long periods?
