THE DAY OF, you have to give me a good excuse not to think this isn't a power move. Stand your ground, just politely tell her it would be rude of you to change everything the day of when family are already in route. And as much as you appreciate her offering to pay should they switch, it would be offensive due to your culture.", "Definitely NTA\n\nToo many things to unpack but that was disrespectful all around.", "NTA. I dunno about your culture but for me it's fairly normal for the person celebrating their birthday etc to pick the restaurant they want to go to. It seems rude when they've already planned something to book somewhere different at the same time. If you want to take them out another time then suggesting somewhere else is ok. If they haven't made any specific plans then surprising them with a restaurant you know they'll like us also fine. But that's not what they did.", "NTA sorry but it\u2019s your boyfriends fault this was ur celebration and he knew u didn\u2019t want to go there and your family didn\u2019t wanna go there either. He should of spoke up", "More info ... did you explain to your boyfriend and his parents that you wanted to keep with your original plans due to cultural customs? They may have meant well, meaning to treat you and your family, but perhaps lack of communication was the real issue.", "NTA - what a stressful way to spend your birthday. I like to think I would have just stuck with the original reservation regardless of what they chose, but I probably would have caved as well. I'm sorry you didn't get to spend your day the way you wanted, but happy belated birthday!", "I don\u2019t even understand this.  Your BF\u2019s parents call him and say there is a change of plan and - everybody just agrees? Why do they get to dictate this? Especially as mere invitees? What is your BF even apologising for if he is just going to cave to his parents for something that has nothing to do with them? Why did he go along with it? And why did you? And why did your family and all the other guests? And why does it not matter that this is not the celebration YOU had in mind for YOUR birthday?", "NTA.  But also don't understand why you didn't just go to the original venue.", "NTA\u2026 if ur bf was trying to surprise you could understand but his parents pulling this shit, it was really dominating to next level. Maybe they are snobs", "NTA at all but I would be very, very seriously side-eyeing your BF about this. He seems to have handled it very badly. Does he understand how upset you are about it? Has he apologised and committed to standing up for your wishes, rather than for his parents' wishes, in future?", "NTA but I sure as hell wouldn't have let them change the original plans.", "I am confused. Why did you and your boyfriend not stick to your plan?\n\nYou just set the tone for your entire relationship by allowing your in-laws to dictate what was happening at the last minute.\n\nIf you are hosting an event at one place and one of your invitees says that they are actually going somewhere else, you just let them know that you aren\u2019t changing your original plan and you\u2019ll miss them. Make it clear they are still invited.\n\nI would have gone to original location with my family and without the boyfriend, tbh.\n\nIt sounds like you were under extreme pressure from your boyfriend though and for the sake of all relationships involved you caved. I think this is now a conversation you need to have. Talk about how you wish it was handled. Talk about how you will handle next time (there will be a next time). If your bf pulls the same stunt next time, that would be a deal breaker for me.\n\nAs to covering the bill; you say that the cultural expectation was that you cover it. I would have allowed those offering to pick up the tab since they offered. But since you insisted, I would ask your boyfriend to make up the difference as part of his way of \u201cmaking it up to you\u201d.", "NTA\n\nFirst I would have said they can either go to the restaurant they want on their own or come to my party at the planned restaurant as guests. Period. \n\nTwo, you need to have a serious discussion with your boyfriend. He might be ok with his parents controlling behavior but you are not. This is line in the sand time. He needs to have a deadly serious conversation with them. They need to understand that the owe you an apology & if this behavior repeats itself ever again it will be the end of his & yours relationship. They will either see the error of their ways & apologize or you just got a preview of your future. They taking over you engagement, wedding, every event around your children, how to raise your children. \n\nHe either fixes this immediately or he\u2019ll be single.", "NTA\n\nEven if you hadn't ended up paying, you still wouldn't be TA but seriously, ungrateful for what? You paid!", "Nta update us when you dump him.", "Red flag. Leave him.\n\nThis is not the family you want to marry into.", "INFO: Why didn\u2019t you just go to your original restaurant? Your bf\u2019s parents can do what they want but you were hosting, you picked the venue. Tbh you were kind of TA to yourself for not just staying with the original plan.", "You make wedding plans, \"Oh we changed the caterers, we're paying. No harm.\" Never mind that you picked vegan options for your aunt. You plan a baby shower, \"Oh we moved it here. We paid so it's fine.\" Never mind you hate that restaurant and can't eat anything there. Your kid is having a birthday, \"oh we moved it here. We'll pay it's fine.\" Except kid has celiac and they have no gluten free options. Stop it now or stop dating him.", "Agree. No need for a tantrum, simply follow the original plan.\n\n\"Thank you for the offer but we are following the original plan.\" Politely refuse to change.

Grow a backbone. No is a complete sentence. You didn't have to go to the new restaurant. You and your family and friends could of continued with YOUR plans.

How/why did your ILs have the ability to change the venue in the first place? And why did they want to change it at all? I thought part of the reason is that they were paying for it, but you say in the second half that it\u2019s standard for you to pay for it (which makes sense since it\u2019s your bday party) and that you did so how did this even happen? And Iwith you five minutes away from the place, who notified all of your guests?", "NTA. And you need to break up with boyfriend's family.  They are controlling, domineering, dismissive of your needs and wishes, and cost you a lot of money. Keep the guy, IF he can be detached from his ungracious parents. And if you actually still like him.", "NTA, but now you know that this man is *never* going to stand up to his parents for you.\n\nWhat *should* have happened is that when his parents announced they were changing *your* birthday plans to what *they* wanted is that he should have said \"okay, you guys have fun, we're going to the restaurant OP wants to go to since it's *her* birthday. You're still welcome to join us if you change your mind.\"\n\nIs this something you want to put up with forever? Because they're *going* to keep doing it.", "NTA. What do you have to be ungrateful about? You paid twice the budgeted amount to eat at a place you don't like. Let this be the thing that opens your eyes to acting in the moment and not being passive. Next time someone tries to change plans or do things you don't want to do, you move forward with the plans you made and let them do whatever they wanted, on their own. Eff customs, it's incredibly uncouth to be invited out somewhere and take it upon yourselves to change the location, and then offer to pay the dinner.\n\nYour boyfriend also played a role in this. He never needed to contact you with an update. All he had to do was deal with his parents and inform them where you and the rest of the guests would be, and that they could join as planned or not.", "NTA\n\nThat's not how any of this works. It's not one of their birthdays. They did not plan the party, or were paying for it at until then. They don't get to \"decide\" to change anything. Do they go in their neighbor's house and \"decide\" the neighbors are having chicken for supper instead of fish. No.\n\nHoney, you should have said no. But more importantly *your boyfriend* should have not even brought this up to you. He should have shut them down immediately when they talked to him. My guess is that they are somehow powerful or important people where they live so they are used to people acquiescing to their (last minute) \"decisions\" \n\nIf your boyfriend cannot put down huge, solid boundaries their \"decisions\" will rule the rest of your life.
