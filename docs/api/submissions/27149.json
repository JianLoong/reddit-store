Our parents sucked, so I spent our childhood trying to protect us both, mostly failing. We only had each other, which because of her limitations and volatility meant Amy only had me to rely on and I had no one.\n\nI've walked on eggshells our whole lives to avoid setting Amy off and always given into her demands to keep her happy. If I had something, it became hers; if she couldn't have it (e.g., friends, boyfriends), I couldn't either or she'd throw a fit. \n\nAs an adult she has gotten more subtle: rather than just demanding things, she will complain to make me guilty and then ask for something (usually money). I didn't notice the pattern of manipulation until my fianc\u00e9 \"Brian\" (m30) pointed it out, because this is how it has always been.\n\nAmy isn't too disabled to work, but she can't delay gratification. As soon as she gets her paycheck she spends it all on weed, anime stuff, clothes, and makeup. \n\nShe was evicted six months ago for non-payment of rent and got fired around the same time for reasons I still don't know. She had nowhere else to turn.\n\nI took Amy in, telling Brian that this would only be until Amy got another job. Now, Amy has a job but is still here. She's not helping with rent, paying for her own groceries, gas, or anything else but always comes home with new shopping bags. On top of Amy overstaying her welcome, Brian has become uncomfortable because of how Amy treats me (constant insults, guilt trips, and much more). Amy doesn't treat anyone else like that, but knows she can get away with mistreating me (at least when Brian isn't there.)\n\nLast week when I found out that Amy has been stealing money from me the whole time she's been staying with us (she admitted it when Brian and I confronted her, but offered no apologies--instead making it all my fault). Amy spent over $2000 of my money *that she stole*, and that's on top of the hundreds I've been paying (without getting so much as a \"thank you\") to keep her fed, clothed, etc. \n\nOn top of that, the next time I came home from work before Brian, Amy cornered me and said she isn't coming to our engagement party because 1) she feels like I \"only care about\" Brian now and not her because I've been spending so much time with him and 2) she can't afford anything to wear to the party because I told her she needs to start paying for her own groceries and contributing to rent (before the theft revelation). It was Amy's way of asking me to buy her an expensive dress to wear to the engagement party and punishing me for setting boundaries. \n\nIf I kick Amy out she will have nowhere to go. When I first told her she had to pay for her own groceries she said \"I guess I'll starve\" and part of me fears she will. But, my enabling Amy isn't fair to Brian either.\n\nWIBTA if I told Amy that she has 1 month to either pay me back the $2000+ she stole and pay 1/3 of the rent or leave?", "created_utc": 1695071063, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16m7as4/wibta_for_kicking_out_my_emotionally_and/", "score": 149, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She needs to move out. Amy is able to work. Amy is able to bring in income. Amy can rent a room somewhere in someone's house and save up for something nicer in the meantime. I would give her one month's notice and tell her she needs to leave. Period. \n\nYour BF is correct that you are enabling her. She is also behaving abusively towards you and you are continuing to allow this behavior out of guilt. I would not allow her to continue living with you. I would give one month's notice, make sure she moves out and also put a credit monitor on all my credit reports to make sure she hasn't stolen any of your numbers or tried to apply for anything in your name.", "NTA.

She needs to leave, period. She needs to get out and you need to never let her back in your place again under any circumstances.\n\nYou badly need a backbone. She was supposed to be out once she got a job. Brian has been a saint about this; don't push him to his limits.", "NTA\n\nI have a sister and a cousin like Amy, so I'm well sympathetic.  The short of it is that this situation is not healthy for anyone, not even Amy.  So yes, it needs to come to an end.\n\nHowever, many countries have supports for people like Amy who are high functioning but need assistance in limited areas.  Rather than kicking her out on the street, I would suggest contacting your local Adult Protective Services (or equivalent in your country).  Let them know you have a vulnerable adult who is experiencing a housing emergency (if you're in the US, you'll also need to make it clear multiple times that she CANNOT remain in the home with you, they will push for that).  Help Amy navigate the system to get herself set up with the housing support she needs.  If she takes it, great.  If she doesn't take it, well, that's her choice.

While it's understandable that you're concerned for her well-being, you also need to consider your own health and the health of your relationship with Brian. You're not responsible for your sister's actions or decisions; she is an adult. It's not fair to you or your fianc\u00e9 to live in a stressful environment where you're being manipulated and disrespected. Setting a deadline for her to meet responsibilities is not only fair but could also be the wake-up call she needs.", "You\u2019re an asshole to yourself. And it will affect your relationship with Brian. Are you really going to risk your relationship over someone who has mistreated you your entire life? What will you do when Amy eventually steals from Brian?", "I\u2019d contact social services to see if you can get her the help and supervision she needs to move out. \nI don\u2019t know how she stole the money, but I\u2019d make it so that can\u2019t happen anymore, and work on a way for her to pay you back.\nThere are organizations that work to help qualifying individuals get the help they need to pay their bills (as in the actual paying, not just the money), and she might qualify for reduced or free housing.\nIn the meantime, I suggest that you work with her on a budget, that includes paying you rent and utilities. If you and Brian agree, AND she starts paying you back, then you might consider saving a portion of her rent money for her to give back to her when she moves out. These are all things you can do to help your sister and also hold her accountable.", "NTA. \n\nKick her out. There is nothing you have to feel guilty about. She knows how to manipulate you and will never change as long as she can manipulate you to help her. Are there any facilities near you who help disabled people? Or give them a guardian? If so maybe make some contacts to them and or give Amy the information about those places. But you have your own live. Your boyfriend. Don't throw that all away because of an ungratefull sister.\n\nAlso maybe ask Brian to help you formulate boundaries you want with Amy. Write them down. Tell them to Amy and when she contacts you again as well as in the time, she is still in your house, always try to check if what Amy is doing is okay with you or goes against your boundries. You were manipulated your whole life, it will be hard to leave those patterns. So listing those points might help", "YNTA\n\nJust kick her out. Don't give her ultimatums.

This is absurd and abusive and I could not accept to live with this situation or watch someone I love live it if they will not do anything about it. \n\nObv there are alternatives eg getting her to accept that you dole out her salary in increments or via grocery gift cards for example but no she's not your responsibility for ever and ever to thte point that you don't get a life.", "I'd take the house key off her ring next time she left and put her stuff on the steps.   \nNTA", "NTA, but I would tell her she has a month to pay back the stolen money or you'll file a police report.  She has to GTFO of your place regardless.", "NTA, definitely not!! If you want her out, yes, this seems like a way to do it. Another is seeing about getting her into or involved with the adult disability services in the area to help find her a stable place without 24/7 care but help for those who are high functioning to do things that are hard or that they do not know how to do. That might take a bit depending on your area so maybe along with that is I need you to pay 1/3 of the rent and start paying back what she stole as 2000+ rent in one month may be too far a reach if the goal is not to just kick her out. If the goal is just kick her out all for it, go for it. You are NTA for wanting to be happy and safe and anything else you want in your own home. It is not hers she has no say, so do what is best for you.", "YTA to Brian for making him live with this.", "NTA. Continuing to enable her isn't going to make things better. You can offer her resources (connecting her with services she might need, helping her fill out applications for subsidies, etc), but covering for her hasn't helped yet, and it's not going to help on the future.", "NTA sounds like she is capable of living on her own, from everything you have described. She can go to a shelter or another family member to leech on.", "Just let her stay, and continue to ruin your life, and take advantage of you/s NTA", "Nta but look into your state's eviction laws. Do it by the book so she can't sue you. You need her out. Give her time to find her own place, yes, but make sure she knows you won't extend the move-out date and this is the last dime you're giving her.\n\nIt's hard to get past that kind of lifelong abuse - what she's doing is textbook abuse. Therapy might be a good help.", "NTA. You protected her for her childhood. Now you need to protect herself. She obviously did not see growing up the same as you. There are care facilities for disabled ppl. But if she can work that means she can care for herself.", "NTA\nIf you want to assuage your own guilt,  find an adult care center or support group and set her up with them before telling her she must leave. But, stick to your guns. Don't tell her to leave in X number of days and then keep waiting and waiting and prolonging it. That will only make an already untenable situation worse. Good luck OP & blessed be. \ud83c\udf39", "ESH\n\nYes, she can keep a (presumably simple and low-paying) job.\n\nThat does not mean that she's capable of the long term planning and abstract thinking that is required to keep to a budget, track bills and save up money to stay on top of them, etc.\n\nI spent decades working in a variety of homes for adults with intellectual and physical disabilities. There were several who had jobs (e.g., wiping the tables at a local coffee shop) but could not manage to live independently.  ***Being able to have a job simply doesn't indicate, on its own, the ability to organize one's life to live independently.*** \n\nExpecting her to come up with $2000 plus 1/3 rent in one month is unrealistic to the point of being AH.  It is setting her up to fail, providing a fig-leaf for you kicking her out, because you \"gave her a chance\" even though it isn't a realistic one.\n\nYour parents are obviously AH for not having her ability to live independently properly evaluated, and getting her into the right sort of supportive environment.  \n\nFor her, I'm thinking some sort of supervised/supportive apartment situation might work, where the staff aren't in her space constantly, but where she gets assistance with organizing her finances, meal planning to ensure that she's managing a budget to keep herself fed on the salary she can earn, and a variety of other things to make up for her inability to mange the abstract thinking required to keep to a budget over the course of a month.\n\nYou probably need to contact adult protective services, and see if they can help her with an emergency placement in some sort of safe place.  \n\nA person, particularly a woman, winding up on the streets when they are intellectually disabled, is a situation of extreme vulnerability.  It puts her at high risk for things like being robbed, raped, or otherwise exploited and abused. It's probably a worse situation than dropping her back at your parents' house, even if they are horrible. \n\nAs a child, you did not have the knowledge, the ability or the legal right to ensure she got the help she needed.  If you're in the US, she should have been eligible for a variety of educational supports. \n\nYour situation with her is a god-awful mess for everyone involved.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There are ways to work around this, and there are cases where social services does work around this (e.g. when a caregiver dies and a person with no formal diagnoses clearly needs help).  What I can tell you about the system is that it's overloaded, so often you need someone willing to advocate and push back when they want to push you off.  You could luck out and get a social worker who isn't burned out and is willing to go the extra mile and be a hero, but be prepared that you may need to advocate for your sister and push this along.  It will be different if she's *willing* to pursue getting a diagnoses vs if she's going to fight it and not submit to an evaluation.  If your sister isn't cooperative with the medical side of this, then unfortunately you may be SOL.\n\nAs for invisible disabilities, that is not an issue (especially with a diagnosis).  But your first battle may be getting your sister the diagnosis she should have so that she qualifies for the services she needs and social services can better understand the sort of support she needs.  The services do exist though.  For example, my cousin's disability is not visible or even perceptible to most people, but she needs accommodations in the workplace and is not able to self-advocate for those.  So one of the supports she receives from the state is help with employment where she has a case-worker who helps her find jobs, apply for them, and then ensures she receives the necessary accommodations to maintain her employment.", "Given her difficulty with delaying gratification, it may be possible to get her set up with someone who can manage her money for her; her paychecks would be automatically deposited into an account she can't access, from which her bills are paid and she is given an allowance.", "Please get therapy to help you deal with Amy.", "I mean, you\u2019re dangerously close to being TA to Brian.

But imagine you knew that you don't deserve to be treated badly by anyone, for any reason and put your own wants and needs first. What would that be like?", ">If your sister isn't cooperative with the medical side of this, then unfortunately you may be SOL.\n\nAmy isn't cooperative about anything ever. I've been trying to get her a therapist since we were 18 (I got her insurance, found her an in-network therapist, gave her money for her copay, etc. but she'd just not show up for her appointment or go to one appointment and find a reason that that therapist was crap and couldn't help her.) \n\nAnd part of the problem is that she is capable of doing things--but she'll only do it if she feels like it. I can't get her help without her realizing what is going on by outsmarting her. She's smart in her own way. She figured out how to get a medical marijuana card despite many bureaucratic hurdles without any help. Brian thinks that she is perfectly capable of surviving on her own but is using weaponized incompetence to mooch off of me. I don't think it's that cut and dry, but I think he's right about her probably being able to survive on her own if she wants to. If she realizes that I'm not going to pay for things anymore, she'll find a way. I'm also no longer worried about her starving because literally within the last hour I just found out that she has had EBT the whole time she's been here and simply neglected to tell me (which explains why she rebuffed my offers to help her fill out an application). All this time I thought she would starve if I wasn't buying her groceries and spending more on her groceries than on my own, and she's had EBT the whole time...\n\nA case worker sounds like exactly what Amy needs--someone who isn't able to be manipulated by her and can get her help without having their emotional/mental health destroyed every time they interact with her.", "He does deserve to live in a home without Amy's constant negative energy. We both dread coming home and we both try to avoid having me get home first. She knows better than to try to manipulate Brian. He's very good at gray rocking, but I am too emotional. I have definitely been a major asshole to Brian by letting Amy stay so long.", ">Fair enough, it's a start. But what about your own peace of mind? When did you last have a day without a knot in your stomach? When was the last time you felt free and relaxed? You appear to put the comfort of others before yourself.\n\nI think the last time I had a day without a knot in my stomach was probably one of the months when Amy didn't ask me for rent before she was evicted the last time and we had zero contact. As dramatic as it sounds, every interaction I have with Amy sends my body into panic mode. When I see I have a message from her, my heart sinks. Every day when I come home, I'm filled with anxiety until I see that Brian's car is there because that means I won't have to encounter Amy alone. Towards the end of the work-day I find a bunch of little tasks and excuses to stay in the office later to avoid being home before Brian so I don't have to deal with one of Amy's tirades. \n\nIf I was putting my own needs first, I would drop Amy off at a fire station like an abandoned infant so I would know someone would take care of her but also never have to see her again.", "I agree with Brian, this seems like a classic case of weaponized incompetence. You're just too close to the situation to see it", "I feel this post in my bones.  Yes, it's likely your sister is deliberately manipulating you because it works and because it's the easiest way to get what she wants.  Many mental impairments are not global, so while many people with certain disabilities may have clear struggles in certain areas, in others they can be well within the normal range of functioning or even gifted on occasion.  Your sister may have troubles with impulse control and delayed gratification (my sister and cousin do too), but that doesn't mean she's incapable of being cunning, calculating, manipulative, crafty, a liar, or an AH (my sister and cousin are all of those).  Heck, my sister just tried to tell me that while she was capable of planning and executing the tricky logistics it took to arrange a 10-day cross-state camping trip at a music festival with her friends, checking her emails once a week is NOT something she's capable of doing.   Uh huh.  Sure.  Like you didn't check your email when you needed to see all those confirmations.  People with disabilities are just that: people.  And just like other groups of people, some are awesome while some are not so great.  And some are AHs who use their disability as a cover to get away with AH behavior.\n\nAnd I agree: a caseworker may be exactly what she needs.  I have friends who work in support for vulnerable adults, and they report that time and again, their clients often respond better to them than they do to family.  There's a professional dynamic in play rather than a familial one, and that makes a huge difference.  Because professionals aren't also being asked to provide emotional support like families are, it's easier for them to set clear boundaries, enforce rules and consequences, and treat their clients as adults.  Sisters might need to coddle each other sometimes as sisterly support, and your sister has leveraged this into a way to get what she wants.  Professionals have no reason to coddle clients, so there's nothing there for your sister to leverage.  People also respond differently to family trying to care for them vs a professional doing their job, and it's likely your sister will as well.\n\nI'd say give your sister a deadline, direct her to social services, and help if she needs it/asks for it.  But let her know that she will not be continuing to live with you, so she needs to be willing to accept support from elsewhere and cooperate if she needs that support.  If she won't cooperate or won't act, then you've tried everything you can and can wash your hands.", "So you feel responsible for her, that much is clear. She doesn't really need someone to take care of her, she can take care of herself. She has a job, she had a home of her own. But she has always had you in the background, giving her a soft landing, being responsible for her wellbeing. At the cost of your own.\n\n\nI'm just a stranger, I think on the other side of the world from you, but it sounds like you need to borrow some strength from someone else for a while until you can find your own. It's obvious that your sister has to go, you know this. You have to make your peace with feeling worried and guilty for a while. It's the cost of your freedom, but it's cheap compared to what you described in your last reply. \n\n\nWill your fianc\u00e9 stand between you and your sister, help you not cave when she escalates the abuse, guilt and insults? Help you block her, answer your phone when you get calls from unknown numbers, delete voicemails etc...? It might help you to break free of her initially.", ">You're just too close to the situation to see it\n\nYeah, that definitely checks out. There have been so many things I was blind to regarding Amy that other people had to point out for me.", "This whole post has been so eye-opening and insightful. Thank you so much. I'm saving it onto my phone so I can reference it later."]}
