The past. But to go to his funeral is to show the depth of humanity, caring, and understanding that you have as a person. You didn't hesitate when you found out. Most people today do not consider the value of human emotions. \n\nIf he still has a problem with this after you explain that to him, then this is a big red flag. Your current boyfriend might not been shown this level of compassion in his life previous to knowing you. Show him compassion and understanding,  but please please please do not change who you are, or let him influence your decision to go to the funeral. Remember that you deserve someone who understands you and accepts who you are to your core. \n\nIn life the only thing that can never be taken from you is your morals. Stay true to who you are and don't stop caring for others. This world needs more people as compassionate and understanding as you are! Be true to you! Best of luck in your situation.

What your boyfriend faces is not the natural anxiety of a \"perfect relationship\" that you're reliving but a sense of you as a possession rather than a person.

I realized that it was a me problem. So, whenever it flared, I kept it internalized. We have been married for 29 years now, and while I still have occasional irrational thoughts, she never knows about them.\n\n\n\nRelationships are about growing together, and telling someone they should be sprinting at the first sign of trouble is ridiculous. OPs boyfriend is definitely the asshole here, but he is also a human being dealing with a new situation.  NTA"]}
