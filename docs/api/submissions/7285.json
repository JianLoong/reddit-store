{"id": 7285, "submission_id": "10bgd0s", "title": "AITA for selling my house and not renewing the lease of a family with a sick child?", "selftext": "Throwaway because I have too many friends on reddit. \n\nI (47M) inherited a property from my father 11 years ago. For the past five years I\u2019ve been renting the house to a nice family with a young child (5M). They\u2019ve been great tenants and there haven\u2019t been any issues. \n\nA month ago I was approached by a realtor about selling my property. He had a buyer who was interested and was ready to offer $60,000 over market because of the location. This was an opportunity I couldn\u2019t pass up. \n\nMy tenants have a lease through mid March. I\u2019ve always renewed every year around this time. I contacted the husband, Michael, and let him know I would not be renewing this time. To say that he was upset was an understatement. It turns out that he and his wife are currently in hospice with their son who has a terminal heart condition. The doctors have given him a month or two to live. I knew the boy was sick but I never knew it was so serious. \n\nMichael told me that there is no way right now that they can pack up the house and find a new rental in time. The hospice where they are currently in residence is over three hours away and he thinks it\u2019s terribly unfair that I expect him to sacrifice any of the time he has left with their son in order to move. He called me a heartless sociopath. I suggested that they have a family member take care of the packing and finding a new place but the only family they have around is the wife\u2019s elderly father (I\u2019m not sure that I believe this because they are too young to only have one parent between them and I\u2019m sure there are siblings somewhere). I then suggested they hire a moving company to handle the packing and try to find a rental online, or possibly an Airbnb for awhile. He claims he can\u2019t afford a moving company because of the son\u2019s medical expenses.   \n\nI feel bad about the situation and realize I\u2019m making things harder for them but it\u2019s not my responsibility to take care of them. I\u2019ve given them the legally required notice. My wife thinks that because of the money I\u2019ll be making that I should offer to pay for a moving company and an Airbnb after they leave the hospice. I don\u2019t want to do this because it would cost me a big chunk of the profit from selling the house and again, their situation is not my responsibility. This is the risk people take when they rent. My wife is now giving me the cold shoulder. \n\nSo, AITA for selling my house and not renewing the lease of a family with a sick child?\n\nEdit\n\nThe purchase agreement has been signed. I\u2019m not selling to a developer but to a family that needs to move to the area for their son\u2019s schooling. I\u2019ll call the buyer and explain the situation and then, if they choose, they can contact the tenants and make arrangements.", "created_utc": 1673673656, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10bgd0s/aita_for_selling_my_house_and_not_renewing_the/", "score": 7599, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or die, and the property is inherited by someone else. A tenant's biggest protection is that, at least in most places in the US, the current lease contract transfers to the new owner. Then it's on the new property owner whether they are going to renew the lease or not. But all a tenant can choose is whether they wish to renew a lease if the landlord is also willing.\n\nIf OP already has an accepted offer and signed the initial purchase agreement, there may be little OP can legally do. They may not be able to back out of the deal, and they may not be able to push closing back far enough to make a difference for the tenants. Wishing otherwise helps no one, and it's not really an AH question.\n\nIf the paperwork hasn't been signed, OP can either decline the offer or say they'd be willing to sell a few months from now after the tenant has relocated according to their own timeline. In this scenario, OP is more fully informed of the situation, so continuing down the sell path with a potential closing date so close to their tenant's death would be an AH move.\n\nBut realistically, the tenants need to bargain with the buyer and see if they can get more time there. Yes, it sucks, but if the paperwork is signed all OP can do is help pay for a moving company and/or a storage unit. But that doesn't let this family keep their home. Only the buyer can do that, and if they're paying so much over market value with interest rates so high, it's likely that they aren't going to negotiate.", "You are making a lot of money.

If you had decided to sell the house and make them move knowing what was going on you would be the AH even if you were legally entitled... It sounds like the deal was already in motion before you heard about their son.\n\nI would seriously consider some kind of assistance for them though, even if it's just one of those storage pods.

YTA indeed", "It's evidently pretty easy if you set your bar of what's right to be approximately the same height as what's legal.\n\nDude didn't even bother to check with the new buyer for any sort of options like a lease back, when he knew the kid was sick.", "YTA. Not only is he causing that extra stress, but he didn't even tell the family until the sale was a done deal. If you're looking at selling, why not give the family a heads up?? Could've built it into the contract to give the family a bit longer.", "Also, this would not fly in other countries. Other countries recognise that the rental home is a home, there are no yearly renewed leases (leases are open end) and people get at least three months notice, often more depending on how long they have been living there. Landlords in my country can't kick a renter out for profit. He could sell, but the buyer would have to honor the open end lease.", "Ah well the wife will probably inevitably get half in the eventual divorce and his revenue dries up anyway. Such is karma.\nI doubt she will ever feel the same again, how could you?", "This was 100% my first thought. If this is real, he's a modern day Scrooge", "Or at least offer to waive the rent for the rest of the notice period so they can use that money on realtors/packers/movers instead. Because hey, he's about to make $60k in profit, I'm sure he can forego a few months rent, right?!", "You can definitely be in the legal clear but still be an asshole. Did you not realize that?", "Exactly. He didn\u2019t know and what\u2019s done is done. Why is he to blame?", "People who do bad things justify it by saying \u201ceverybody does it\u201d.", "Some people just lack empathy and all they care about is money.\n\nWhat ideas? get help from a family they don't have? and OP has the audacity to not believe when someone says to him they don't have anyone but elderly father (like, people die).\n\nHis wife proposed a nice idea but he refuses to help a little bit because I guess he doesn't care about anything but himself and his precious money.", "They could also be first gen immigrants with no other immediate families in this country. All sort of scenarios, but OP had to choose doubting them so he feels no guilt.", "Oh gosh, I hadn\u2019t thought of the situation like that\u2026 this makes it even more heartbreaking", "\"Mankind was my business. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence, were, all, my business. The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business! '\u201d--Jacob  Marley, from \"A Christmas Carol\"--", "I was in a similar situation leasing a house. The landlord was a couple that moved out of the state and they eventually sold it. They gave us ample heads up and was very apologetic about it. It was also their first home and they put a lot of work into it themselves. Not everyone is a greedy asshole and there's a difference between people who earned it or became landlord due to circumstance and people who just inherited it and treat it like a cashcow.", "I would say he is not right. He is legally in the clear, however, he is 100% morally bankrupt.", "Or just inherit it, like OP.", "Yeah but this isn\u2019t an employee employer relationship. This is a rental and so the dynamics are different. And even so, he\u2019s given adequate notice. It sucks to be the tenants in this case for sure. \nI don\u2019t see why he needs to pay for a mover and an AirBNB.", "I would if I were her", "At this point it depends on the part of the country. My personal house went from a 250k value to 750k in about 10 years.", "We paid $790k for a house in October 2021 it had gone up $60k by January 2022.", "Not to mention profit is revenue minus cost, and if he inherited this house then its likely he doesn't owe on the house especially 11 years later", "tdi learned Mensch is not just a german word (human)", "Yeah I agree with what you\u2019re saying but I\u2019m just pointing out he said himself that he doesn\u2019t want to offer financial help because it would cut into his profits. So he\u2019s choosing the utterly heartless option.", "You\u2019re AH without compassion too then.", "The 60k isn't the only profit, since he didn't buy the house in the first place.", "til Mensch is not just a german word (human)", "It's possible it could be in an area that's difficult to purchase a house? A desirable area with very few properties up for sale.", "I don't know if OP is Australian but there are several parts of Melbourne and Sydney which fall in the catchment of very good public schools, and house prices in the catchment are way higher than neighbouring areas. Because the quality of public schools is generally not great in comparison to the highly popular private school system, getting to attend a very good public school will save you maybe $300,000 per child in private school fees. So financially, buying a house in those catchment zones is worth it, but extremely sought after and near impossible to buy in. Real estate agents will actually advertise the school zone as a feature of the property, and it's one of the first questions you would ask: \"is this in the McKinnon/Gardenvale/Balwyn school zone?\"", "And from an out of the blue approach? I mean, has he even had the house valued to see if their value is correct before accepting that they\u2019re offering sixty over or has he taken the agent\u2019s word? Maybe the house is actually worth a hundred grand more that they\u2019re valuing it and they\u2019re shorting him by forty!", "OP didn't directly accuse them of lying. Though he was trying to find an \"aha!\" about this \"nice family whom he's not had any issues with for years\" to justify his actions. He is heaping a major move on a family during an already traumatic time and doesn't think the cause is his responsibility because PROFIT.\n\nJust awful. I hope for the sake of his soul, he listens to his wife, because there's more at stake now.", "Haven't you heard, orphans don't exist?", "You sold your soul for $60k, but I'd argue it's barely worth a few cents at this point. \"This is the risk people take when they rent.\" So what are people supposed to do for housing? Buy something, as if we all have tens of thousands of dollars lying around? Not everyone can just inherit a house like you.", "Am I the only one getting bad vibes from the way OP talks about the 'only family left'? Wtf do you mean you don't believe they could have only one parent left and no siblings? \n\nThe couple themselves is example for him, if they have only 1 kid, many others have as well, if 5 years old can get sick and pass away, surely anyone can? Like what even is that logic?", "I don't understand how people can be this Heartless. \nLegally you  **might**  be in the clear but morally you are absolutely YTA,how do you sleep at night?", "Y\u2019know all those movies you watched as a kid? About some greedy developer/landlord type and the heroes undermining the sale? Well, you have shown you CAN relate to the antagonists.\n\n\u2018Business is Business\u2019 doesn\u2019t go with \u2018Doing the right thing\u2019 because that can be hard, and at times inconvenient, with nothing to be gained except a clean conscience.

You were simply hoping you would find people who agree with you so you could feel good about being an AH since your wife now views you differently.", "Look at the cost of helping your tenants as an investment in the longevity of your marriage. Your wife is obviously a better person than you. And your big problem now is she is likely realising it.", "YTA. This is why we think all landlords are bastards.", "What an absolutely cruel asshole you are. Fucking hell", "Landlords are bastards as always", "I honestly don\u2019t know how you\u2019re able to live with yourself after making this decision. God forbid you ever have to suffer the pain of slowly losing a child and then have some asshole vastly worsen your situation for his own profit. They have been great tenants for five years and paying you the entire time - they don\u2019t deserve this. YTA. If you\u2019re so desperate for the extra cash, negotiate with the buyer to maintain the lease or do something for the tenants, but really dude, idk how it can possibly be unclear to you that you are absolutely the asshole here. Yet another reason to hate landlords.", "Sometimes I wonder if the people writing this ever read the title they give and think \"hmm I wonder if maybe I AM the ah......no way probably not\" and then hit post. \n\nAlso OP, YTA. You're kicking out a family with a sick child for $60k over market price. Literally nothing you could write after that would salvage that, unless that extra $60k is paying for your own family member's chemo or something.", "YTA\nEspecially because you reject the notion that you should help those tenants financially, when you're literally throwing them out of their home in the middle of a traumatic tragedy.", "Like not raising rent is such a good cause?? Did your mortgage go up?? Raising rent for no reason should be illegal", "This is barely morally neutral so don't pat yourself on the back too quickly", "What really sealed the asshole judgement for me is saying they were too young to only have one parent between them. OP that\u2019s bullshit. By the time I was 7 I lost both parents. I feel really bad for this family.", "Isnt it rather that the government is the YTA here that they dont have hardship protections?", "Unless they only inherited the equity and the house still and a mortgage on it.\n\nHowever, this is not the case with OP.", "But what has it done in the last 6 months?", "14 here. Lost my last parent by 40.", "Depends on where OP is. In some countries, houses are still selling well in particular areas.", "Another way to go: Explain to buyers the situation. Negotiate a change in the contract to close the sale on schedule, but delay possession of the house by 3 months. Pay to rent a temporary place for buyers. Surely close escrow on the deal though. This is tough on everyone but situations like this does happen.", "If your making that much profit you can hire a moving company to come pack the house and move for them. In USA that cost is somewhere between $800 to $2000 for a smaller rental. You can also give them January rent back and not ask them to pay for February so that they have money to rent a new house and put a deposit down. If you can\u2019t at least do that then I\u2019m with your wife. Do the right thing, find your heart because your wife\u2019s view of you will last longer than the money. You probably could write that off of the capital gains taxes your going to have to pay on selling the house.", "NTA..others wouldn't care if you where in their shoes.\nSad..but not your responsibility.", "I would say NTA. Their current situation should not be based on your good will. You gave them the allowed time and if the hospital is 3 hours away from the home, they might find something closer to the hospital, saving them travel time.", "NTA, their problems are not your responsibility. You fulfilled your legal obligations by giving them the proper notice.", "NTA. \n\nObviously a terrible situation but you are not responsible for it not it. You did not even know about it. \n\nIt would be one thing if you were going to be making a few hundred dollars but this is 60,000 more. To many that is a life changing amount and inheritance or not, you should not have to forgo it or risk forgoing it.", "NTA like Reddit karma, humanity does not pay the bills. It\u2019s unfortunate what is happening to them but it is reality.", "they wouldn\u2019t do the same for you if they got that much shoved in their face and y\u2019all would do the same thing he\u2019s doing, NTA.", "NTA it's not you responsibility. It would've been the kind thing to do, but with the housing market as is atm your house could be worth half that in 2 years and the tenants are not going to compensate for that.", "NTA.  It's your home and you have the right to sell it.  Just because their child is dying doesn't mean you have to put your life or plans on hold.", "NTA. From my understanding this offer was taken prior to you finding out about hospice? You only found out because you contacted the tenant. Which isn\u2019t a normal thing to do. If you had went solely through the agent looking after the property you would\u2019ve never known. \nI would give the new owners a heads up, then they can decide from there what to do once the house is in their possession", "NTA. You gave them notice. You are not responsible for the world's woes. Making decisions with your heart is bad business. Be fair to people, but leave kindness for the charities.", "What a repulsive way of thinking.", "He knows about it now.", "Morally yta. Legal n t a. I\u2019m going with morales here.", "YTA\nThere'll always be another buyer.", "A great way to consider this is to have OP put himself in that families shoes. How would he feel if his landlord told he had to leave in two months? I\u2019m sure he would be upset as well. I know if I was in his shoes I would try and do what I could. I would try and come to arrangement to see if the tenant would split the moving and I would borrow some of my friends to help move. I would then also provide them their full security deposit back and cover 1st months rent for their new place. House prices are heavily inflated right now and you are making an additional 60k on top of that. I think you can spare some of that. Hell and you could probably look at it as a charitable donation and right it off on your taxes."]}
