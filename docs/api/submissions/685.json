I like her and all, but she virtually doesn't care for people's emotions and expects others to care for hers. For example, when I was crying about the stress I've been enduring, she got mad at me for overreacting, but when i got a better grade than her on the test she got jealous and just ignored me for a whole week without caring and then came back to talking to me as if it was nothing. She's mean to others but when she is in a good mood she's funny and we're both part of a larger friend group of about 4-5 people. After I graduate (I'm a senior), I never had the desire to keep a long-lasting relationship with any of them, as I'd only met them the last two years and never really felt that strong of a bond. Ever since I was younger I've always wanted to do medicine as a career and she's wanted to do biotechnology and genetics and rejected the idea of medicine ever since I've met her.\n\nNow the problem - recently, I've been preparing to apply to this one college that I really hope to get into and attend. It's a medical college and doesn't offer any other courses. Recently she's been thinking of medicine as a career choice out of the blue, and has decided to apply to the same college that I'm going to. I honestly don't want her to. That makes me the asshole. She texted me saying she wants to be my roommate, but she's extremely messy and we have totally different cleaning and organization styles. \n\nI'm here looking for advice. I don't want to feel that way but every time I think about it, I dread the idea of attending college with her. I want to go to college and meet people similar to me, as I am a different personality around her since she's cold and closed off. I am the total opposite, and I feel like if we go together we'll meet people together and I'll be introduced to people as this person I am around her - not myself basically. I really want to form lasting relationships in college and I feel like she will ruin that.", "created_utc": 1667305146, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yj77yb/aita_for_not_wanting_my_friend_to_go_to_college/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just tell her you don\u2019t want her deciding her whole future based on your preferences, especially when you don\u2019t think rooming together is a good idea on account of the whole different approach to housekeeping thing, and leave it at that.  University is a big place.

This isn\u2019t a friend. It\u2019s just a person you know. You can\u2019t stop her from going but you can refuse to share accommodation. Just say no, I don\u2019t want to share with you. Then try and avoid her and make actual friends and she\u2019ll hopefully make her own. Don\u2019t be rude but you don\u2019t have to share accommodation for her sake.", "NTA here, having someone you know is gonna be incompatible as a roommate would just make college stress more intense. And you're feelings about not wanting her to go to the same college are vaild but - as I'm sure you probably know - you can't control her college choices. If you find out you're both accepted tho, it's on you to tell her you don't wanna be her roommate. Hold your ground there too. But as soon as you tell her no to the roommate thing you don't owe her anything else.", "NTA, but you will definitely be the asshole if you stay friends with her. You can't have it both ways, he honest with her with your feelings."]}
