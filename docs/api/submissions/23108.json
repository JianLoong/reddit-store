He broke his collarbone, not his back. That's a sling and that's it. Unless it's his dominant hand he shouldn't have much trouble doing anything he needs to.", "YTA. He pays rent, and he needs someone to help him right now. His mom can't come because, checking notes.... He pays a third of the rent and doesn't clean up after himself? That's reaching. \n\nIf you don't want him as a roommate, that's one thing; but not letting his mom help him out as he he's recovering from a broken bone is an AH move.", "YWBTA\n\nIts going to suck to be him for a week or two.  Breaking a collar bone is painful.\n\nHowever he sounds like a nightmare room mate.  Hopefully his mum is a decent sort of person and will see how he is and give him a kick up the backside to sort his ways out.\n\nIts time to make him pay his way properly and start pulling his weight.  If not then look for another place and leave him to his squalor.", "What does your lease state in terms of guests and how long they may stay? If it\u2019s silent, speak with your landlord and state your concern about a long term guest. If the lease states something along the lines of no guest may stay more than XX number of days, then stick with the lease language. \n\nBe clear about expectations. In writing (text or email) tell your roommate that his mother may not stay more than X number of days. Also be clear about messes. If the mother does stay, the expectation is she is to clean up after herself and her son. \n\nYou and your gf are adults. Behave as such and don\u2019t let mommy and her baby bully you. \n\nNTA. But why the hell is he not paying communal bills and paying less in rent? That\u2019s foolish and should be remedied.", "Tell him he has to pay half and gets no kitchen privilege's unless he cleans up after himself", "YWBTA. He is hurt and his mom can come help for a few days. Maybe she will even help y\u2019all around the house while she\u2019s there. It\u2019s perfectly fine for his mom to come visit for a bit if he\u2019s on the lease.

He pays rent and can have his mom over if she's not actively yelling at you or reporting your suspicious activities to the police (Honestly, kick her out if she's reporting your edibles). Otherwise, everything else is a separate issue. If you need to charge him more, talk about that. If he leaves dirty dishes on the counter or in the sink, box them up and put them in front of his door.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He isn\u2019t even living in the apartment rn.

Your concerns make sense but in this case YWBTA. The best we can hope for is mercy when we need it.", "He\u2019s only paying less than rent because he doesn\u2019t get to use the 2 car garage because me and my girl called dibs on it so he gets $25 a rent payment off because that\u2019s how much each of us paid for our carport at the apartment we were just staying at, and the only other bill he\u2019s ever paid is the internet", "That won\u2019t work, he\u2019s just gonna get dramatic and yell at me that he already pays rent and we aren\u2019t his parents, and this is the big one that always gets thrown back in my face any time we try to get him to take responsibility", "That\u2019s not how things work.

He can even force himself to stay on the lease as he can usually resign the lease without your approval.  You're complaining about a roommate staying in his room all the time, sounds like a dream roommate.\n\nIf he's on the lease, see if there are rules for having someone stay on the lease.  That can be your out.  But this would be a good lesson to learn how to set limits, enforce rules and allow someone who really shouldn't be doing much physically to have help.  Allowing him to have no help is pretty heartless.  And it's pretty AH to not discuss this even.\n\nTrying to sabotage out of spite - grow up.", "Your situation sucks, but he has the right to be there and have his mom visit.

How long does he really need help.", "> electric unicycle \n\nTells me everything I need to know about this dude. Does the unicycle happen to be connected to his broken bone?", "No he fell down the stairs, didn\u2019t wreck the unicycle but it\u2019s the fact he told us he had a bunch of money set aside for emergencies and we had just moved in and he drove a couple hours away to get it and then we were short to pay landlords some fees and our power went out and when his power went out he just left and forgot about his car and tried to bring his girl up while it was blistering hot in our house and we\u2019re trying to keep animals alive and cooled off and meanwhile he\u2019s off riding that damn unicycle and hanging out outside of town with his girl", "Idk how old you are but I\u2019m 25 and have been under the assumption nobody has money set aside for emergencies \ud83d\ude02 Guy sounds like a piece of work, hopefully you can find a better living situation with your gf", "Yea we wanna get rid of him pretty bad, all 3 of us are 21 too"]}
