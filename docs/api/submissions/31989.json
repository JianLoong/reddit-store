The company put a bunch of us up in a hotel and had us attend a day-long presentation about our goals for the next quarter.  For context: We're in sales, it's highly competitive, and the group consisted of mostly older employees with me being the youngest. \n\nAfter a full day of meetings, a few of us decided to get dinner at a restaurant down the street from our hotel. We carpooled, and when we arrived, one of the older ladies (Deborah, 50s?) was already there, standing at the bar. We invited her to join us for food, but she declined, and we moved on with our night. I had two beers with dinner, so I'm not judging, but as we finished our meal, it became clear that Deborah was plastered. She was stumbling even though the ground was level and slurring pretty badly.\n\nAs we left, Deborah came outside with us and reached for her keys. I immediately stopped her and said I'd drive her back to our hotel. She agreed, but as she went to grab the passenger door handle, she missed and fell straight back onto the pavement, hitting the back of her head. I don't mean to be gross, but it sounded like someone dropped a carton of eggs. I checked, and not only was she passed out, but she was bleeding from her head.\n\nEveryone panicked, and I grabbed my phone to call 911. One of the younger guys stopped me and said, \"Help me get her in the car. We'll get her room key out of her purse and just put her in bed.\" I was bewildered and said, \"But she has a head injury. She's bleeding. What if she cracked her skull?\"\n\nI'm no doctor, but if you go to sleep with a head injury, don't you not wake up? I'm pretty sure I learned that in school, and some of the other employees agreed with me, so I called the ambulance. Paramedics took Deborah to the hospital, and she survived, though she was in really bad shape when I checked up on her the next day.\n\nHere's where I may be the asshole: our managers found out that Deborah was hospitalized for overdrinking while technically at a work function, and they fired her on the spot. Everyone also found out that I was the one who insisted on calling an ambulance. The older employees are all saying I did the right thing and that she could have died, but the younger ones are calling me a snake and saying I got her fired on purpose because she was \"competition.\"  \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701280638, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/186vmyw/aita_for_calling_an_ambulance_which_got_my/", "score": 127, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don't want to live with it when they end up putting someone to bed with a bleeding head and the next morning that person is dead.", "Wow, your work environment really sucks. NTA but get the heck out of there quick. You may need medical attention at work someday and you now know your coworkers would shove your body into a dark corner and hope for the best.", "NTA.  You did the right thing.", "NTA Exactly how young are these people to think getting fired is worse than death?", "NTA. Tell them to look up how Bob Saget died \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f He was in a hotel room & definitely didn\u2019t bounce his head as hard as Deborah did & he\u2019s no longer here is he?", "NTA. Your coworker was in actual, real danger and absolutely needed medical help. A head injury like that can be fatal.\n\nIt's unfortunate she got fired as a result, but your younger co-workers might need to review their priorities: better unemployed and alive than died on the clock.", "NTA. It's too bad that happened but your coworkers are only conjuring up drama that doesn't exist by making this situation bigger than it is, which is that your coworker experienced a significant injury that required medical services. This doesn't even really make sense as a viable 'strategy' to take out your competition, so that's such an absurd claim. Let them stew in the drama, keep your head up high, and it'll probably die down.  \n\n\nEDIT: Are those coworkers saying the same thing about the guy who just wanted to take her key from her pocket and put her to bed, saying he wanted to do that so that she'd DIE and stop being his COMPETITION? lol", "Nta. Deborah got herself fired. She should know better then to drink out of control at a work function.", "NTA There would have been greater consequences if you had put her to bed and she didn't wake up. You calculated risk and acted appropriately.", "NTA.\n\nDeborah was the one who chose to drink too much, and then try to drive. You didn't know how badly she'd injured herself, and you did the absolute right thing by calling an ambulance. Anybody with a brain would have done the same thing. It's not your fault she got fired, either.", "NTA: what? It sounds like THEY were the ones hoping to get rid of her as competition since they were okay with her dying in a hotel room from a traumatic brain injury and lack of medical attention. Only an insane psychopath wouldn\u2019t call an ambulance in that situation.", "NTA, and it really shows the character of your coworkers. What if you had an unexpected medical event? they wouldn\u2019t even call you an ambulance if it even mildly inconvenienced them. You did the right thing, it\u2019s better for her to lose her job than to die. You also could\u2019ve been in a lot of legal trouble if you\u2019d snuck her into her room and she\u2019d died. Sounds like maybe she has a drinking problem, or at least a regulation problem, and maybe this is her wake up call.", "INFO: \n\n>Here's where I may be the asshole: our managers found out that Deborah was hospitalized for overdrinking while technically at a work function, and they fired her on the spot.\n\nAnd how did they find that out? Why weren't they told that she merely fell down and hit her head? Why did they require more information? Unless you told them that she fell because she was shitfaced, you're not the asshole.", "NTA. If she had died you and everyone else would be in the hot seat.", "NTA\u2014-YOU didn\u2019t cause her to get fired. SHE did. She\u2019s lucky shes alive and that she\u2019s not in jail thanks to you.", "Nta at all assuming this is the entire story, she could have been dead which is of course a lot worse than being fired, also work are too harsh, a warning would have sufficed.", "NTA If you had tucked her into her bed and let her sleep it off and she died, that would have been much worse. True, she turned out to be ok, but you had no way of knowing that. You acted appropriately.", "NTA you may have literally saved her life.", "NTA.\n\nIn my jurisdiction, not calling the ambulance when somebody looks seriously injured like that is an infraction (it's not like the patient is going to be charged hundreds and hundreds of dollars for the ambulance ride and stay at the ER).\n\nHad she died from the proposed neglect, it would have been a weight way too heavy on your conscience.\n\nThe young salespeople(?) are completely deluded. She got herself fired by overdrinking at a work function. You did your human decency duty by calling the ambulance on somebody bleeding from the skull.", "NTA - she could\u2019ve died from that injury and you guys would\u2019ve been liable if you just put her to bed like someone suggested instead of getting her help. As far as her getting fired, that\u2019s 1000% on her especially for the fact that she was already drinking before y\u2019all got there then still tried to drive back after.", "You can\u2019t control other people\u2019s drinking habits, obvious NTA. She may have gotten canned for it even without the injury. Good on you for giving more of a shit about her staying alive than your coworker who suggested she sleep it off.", "NTA.  She was responsible for her own actions and would have known the rules around work events and expected drinking behaviour.  You were right calling 911 as it is very easy to die from a head injury.", "NTA. It really has me worried for our future when all the young coworkers are saying you should\u2019ve just left her alone in her room bleeding with a head injury.", "Abso-fucking-lutely NTA. I work in HR and I am super annoyed at your coworkers response. \n\nTell them the full details of what happened. Tell them that it sounded like a carton of eggs dropping. Make the point that you said nothing to management about her drinking so why don\u2019t they focus on who told them that? Or better yet why don\u2019t we all just be grateful your coworker didn\u2019t die?", "NTA she messed herself up by drinking in the first place.", "NTA. Head injuries are serious. How exactly did managers get hold of medical records to prove she had been drinking to much? She was hospitalised for a head injury, sounds dodgy to me.", "Nta you\u2019re not the one that told the company anyways. You did the right thing", "NTA.  If she was hospitalized for overdrinking, and not for a head injury, she was still hospitalized.  You may have saved her life either way.  Thank you.", "[removed]", "You didn\u2019t get her fired, you saved her life.", "It's very dangerous to go to bed with a head injury, yes.  Those younger ones are dangerous.  I don't want to be around them in case of an emergency.\n\nNTA", "NTA Why is anyone mad at anyone??\n\nThe options were take her to the room and have her possibly die in bed leading everyone involved to be charged with criminal negligence for not getting help and also getting civilly sued for negligence by her family. If she didn\u2019t die in this scenario its very possible any lasting damage would get worse and worse until she got help. If not you really were looking at a high chance of coming back in the morning and finding a corpse. \n\nOR \n\nYou call the ambulance, got her the help she NEEDED, and she deals with the consequences of her own actions. Her own choices got her fired not the fact you saved her life \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\nThese comments are ridiculous. The company would have found out regardless because she would miss work for being in the hospital \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I feel like I am going crazy and all logical thought was left out the window in this comments section. \n\nNTA you very likely svaed her life and if she wouldn\u2019t have died you probably saved her from permanent brain damage if she doesn\u2019t already have some from that fall.", "NTA - you might have saved Deborah's life.  Better to get someone fired then explain that you put a distressed and knocked out co-worker in their room to die on their own.  What a bunch of fucktards.", "NTA- what if she wasn\u2019t ok? Could you live with yourself for not calling? I\u2019m of the mindset that its better to be safe than sorry. Head trauma is not something to sleep off and that co-worker is an idiot.", "NTA\n\nFuck them. She could have died.\n\nAnd fuck your job. Did they pay her bar tab? No? Then it wasn't a work function. She was on her own time at that point.", "NTA. Doctor here. Combination of head injury and loss of consciousness (could\u2019ve been because of the alcohol too, but that wasn\u2019t for you to assess) is definitely a reason to call 911 and perform a scan at the hospital. She could\u2019ve developed an internal bleeding in the brain, for example. You did the right thing.", "NTA Deborah got fired because she overdrank at a work event.  Not because you called an ambulance, which potentially saved her life.\n\nYou don't mess around with head injuries like that.   Everyone saying you shouldn't have called because of workplace politics are a bit psychotic.", "NTA. She could have died, you did the right thing.", "NTA head injuries are nothing to \u201csleep off\u201d you did the right thing, she got herself fired for not controlling her drinking. You just made sure nothing worse happened.", "NTA.  You did the right thing by calling an ambulance to address a serious head injury.  Everything else is irrelevant.  Would the other employees be happy if she ended up dying or getting severely injured because it was left unaddressed?", "NTA. Better to be fired than dead. I would tell your boss that you're getting harassed about this.", "Most likely the same people who told the managers would have told them that she drank too much and hit her head, whether an ambulance was called or not. Those younger guys need to grow up. She could have died if it weren\u2019t for you. Good job for saving her life and calling an ambulance regardless of people telling you not to.", "Nta you did the right thing. Leaving her in the hotel room\ncould\u2019ve gone seriously wrong and gotten everyone there in trouble. any feelings of guilt u got rn would not compare to the guilt of her dying bc you all didn\u2019t call an ambulance.", "NTA.  Better jobless than dead.", "NTA. Better fired than dead.", "NTA and gosh, had you done what the older employees recommended, you may all be giving police statements right now.  I'm certain you would have lost your job for letting a coworker die lol", "NTA\n\nHead injuries kill people. Bleeding from the head after a drop in concrete is super concerning, and she was passed out? Passing out from a head injury isn't like it is in movies, even a couple seconds is a sign of something bad", "\"but the younger ones are calling me a snake and saying I got her fired on purpose because she was \"competition.\"\"\n\nNTA. I have serious concerns about your company's vetting process if it's hiring people whose critical thinking skills lead to that kind of conclusion.\n\nDeborah is not even a same age peer, and you seem to be new to the office politics. So while surely there is a way to TRY to protect her (by telling your job the least amount of info) you were not in a position to know it.\n\nAnd you can't protect anyone from the consequences of their actions. It was an on the job injury. Without prompt medical treatment, your job would be on the hook for even more money. But your job also wants to cut its losses.", "NTA. I can't believe that a number of your coworkers thought that Deborah could just sleep that off. That's a serious injury that should be dealt with at a hospital. Yes it sucks that she got fired as a result, but that wasn't your fault for calling 911.", "NTA\n\nLosing consciousness should generally be considered a medical emergency, especially if it's due to a head injury.
