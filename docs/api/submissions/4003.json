For some reason rent is what she wants. If I pay 12k in rent, but the yearly cost of maintaining the home and paying its taxes is only 6k, then I\u2019d be losing 9k (12k-3k [my half of costs] = 9k loss) when I could be saving that toward retirement, buying a home together, a new vehicle, investing, etc.\n\n...\n\nHaving a written agreement (a lease) is never a bad thing. \n\n... \n\nI'm assuming for major repairs you'd also kick in half... So like the water heater goes out, you'd pay half... The roof eventually needs replaced you pay half... \n\nI also think that she is self protecting by asking for a rental agreement.

No wonder you've been able to buy a home without a mortgage at 25.\n\nShe isn't an idiot either - that's why she's not giving anybody a free lunch.  \n\nYTA", "You have no idea what you are talking about.  In some areas splitting the bills with a partner in a shared residence might entitle op to a share of ownership.  By asking for rent it allows ops partner to evict them like a tenant in case of breakup.  Op should rent out his home and pay a position of it to GF for rent.", "Is OP going to split the income they earn of renting their house out then? \n\nCause otherwise OP is gaining while the girlfriend is suffering depreciation of an asset", "No mortgage means full taxes, keep that in mind as well. If this is a lump sum to cover bills and taxes, depending on the worth of the house and area they are in, this may be justified.\n\nOwning a house outright still comes with significant expenses, and most people have tax breaks that keep property taxes lower with a mortgage", "I came here to say this. It sounds like moving in is a bad idea at this point.", "You absolutely charge your partner rent. But you charge them about as much or less than a rental room in the area.\n\nThe money goes towards maintaining the home. I just had to buy an emergency washer. Guess what money that came from??\n\nOp, how did you see this going? Live with her and rent out or sell your place while she sits there maintaining her own home and you get all the breaks? You either both pay towards a home fund(ie rent) that she controls as it is her house or you both rent out your places and rent a 3rd new place together until ready to marry and comingle assets.", "As per OPs comment:\n\n\" 1. My home would become a vacation home for us to use when we get time off from work.\n\n2. The option of her moving in wouldn\u2019t work given the nature of her job. It\u2019s a really good job, just hard to relocate. My job is also good, just a lot more flexible. Without this constraint I would have no issue with her moving in (without any expectation of rent) \n\n3. My home is about 1750sq/ft, hers is about 2200sq/ft so larger but not by too much. \n\n4. I offered to pay for half of all month-to-month expenses, plus half of maintenance and taxes. For some reason rent is what she wants. If I pay 12k in rent, but the yearly cost of maintaining the home and paying its taxes is only 6k, then I\u2019d be losing 9k (12k-3k [my half of costs] = 9k loss) when I could be saving that toward retirement, buying a home together, a new vehicle, investing, etc. \"", "GF is not taking all the financial risk. If OP rents their apartment out and then they break up, gf could kick him out and he might not be able to move back into his own home for several months (depending on the tenancy agreement). Plus OP would be on the hook for any repairs or damage the tenants cause to his home. \n\nAgree that he should make some contribution but that should account for the risks they\u2019re both taking.", "A room in a shared home in my city is about $900.", "I mean ok, in my city (largest in my state) you can rent a 2 bedroom for less than 1000. That's not exactly relevant.", "This is a solid compromise, yes. OP moves in with his GF, rents out his own house, and they split both the income from that and the bills for her house.", "You purposely left out the splitting bills part just to make OP looks bad", "Umm, what?  How is girlfriend's asset depreciating?  Homes generally appreciate over time.", "I remember my parents complaining about how bad their property taxes were every year and, as a homeowner now, I don't understand it. The annual taxes on most homes are VERY affordable (under $1500 annually for our ~3000sqft home). The insurance isn't cheap, but even with our utilities/internet/home upkeep, it isn't anywhere near $1,000 a month. \n\nFunny enough, we saved money after buying our home. Apartment life was comparatively expensive.", "She may be concerned that you\u2019d have claim to part of her home equity if you\u2019re splitting maintenance costs and taxes rather than paying \u201crent\u201d while she gains no equity in your home that she just visits a couple times a year. If that\u2019s the issue, there\u2019s probably a good solution that doesn\u2019t cost $1k/month that a quick legal consult could help set up for you guys. I\u2019d ask her if that\u2019s the problem she\u2019s trying to solve, then look for a more agreeable solution.", "I want to live where you do lol one room studio apartments where you have a kitchen in a bathroom literally costs minimal 2,000 a month. Without utilities. It's terrible", "So when the heater breaks and needs to be replaced he\u2019s going to cover half? A new roof? When she needs to pay for tree removal after a storm? \n\nOr is he just going to say \u201cyour house, your problem?\u201d Rent covers a lot more than the mortgage.", "\"Bills\" generally mean water, gas, electric, cable, groceries.  Not the things I mentioned.  I've been in situations like this.", ">You purposely left out the splitting bills part just to make OP looks bad\n\nWhat I mentioned, generally, are not considered \"bills\".", "Property taxes vary greatly, and very often are based upon the house/condo. Quality of school district will also impact taxes. Here in suburban Columbus Ohio, i pay over $7000 for 1900 sq ft.", "> (under $1500 annually for our ~3000sqft home)\n\nWhere do you live?  When I lived in New Hampshire, property tax was about 2% (which I thought was relatively high, but it worked out since there were almost no other state or local taxes) and a modest house cost $200k so taxes would be $4k a year.  Now in New York City property tax is about 1% but even a one-bedroom co-op costs at least half a million so the amount paid is higher.  I looked at houses on Long Island but changed my mind when I find out property taxes were about 3%!", "Dang, our home is half your size and our property taxes are substantially more. And we live in an area that's considered pretty affordable.", ">So when the heater breaks and needs to be replaced he\u2019s going to cover half? When she needs to pay for tree removal after a storm?\n\nYes, he is. He has stated so in comments.", "Pretty sure that what covering half of expenses is.", "Are you old enough to be on the internet? do you not know what expenses mean or include?", "Reading is a good thing", "Taxes and insurance are generally considered bills, at least on Earth idk how it is anywhere else", "They are considered bills by every normal and reasonable person.", "Colorado. Flyover states tend to be much less expensive. We left CA years ago due to the crazy taxes/prices there.", ">Landlord does repairs, not the tenant.  If she wants him to pay \"rent\" he gets treated like a tenant, not an owner.\n\nI agree, my problem is that they shouldn't be in a landlord and tenant situation. same with the person you replied to above me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthey should just share upkeep costs on both houses and live in whichever is most convenient. charging the SO rent in this situation is just gonna result in them not living together as why would they pay rent when they have their own house.", "Except one of the reasons rent is useful for landlords is banking cash. If a furnace needs to be replaced, for example, is OP gonna have the thousands at one time to pay for half a replacement? Chances are no, and if Insurance has a high deductible it's going to be a huge stressor.c\n\nBut if a bit is going into a household account every month, then, yeah, there might be enough there.\n\nOverall, they aren't communicating well and OP doesn't understand costs that come with the house. Easiest solution is they both contribute to a joint account every month that covers household expenses. However, OP should also know that doesn't always mean expenses won't exceed what's in the account", "Wits reedinkg?", "No, he basically wants to make money off her.  He rents his current house out, he\u2019s making bank not only by collecting rent, he\u2019s trying to live rent free off girlfriend.", "One day I want to retire early to a place like that.  I don't like living in a big city and it gnaws at me to know that I'm paying so much money for this \"privilege\".", "He isn't renting his house and he pays half the utilities he shouldn't pay anything on top of that.", "It\u2019s going to sit empty while he lives with OP?  Don\u2019t think so.  If he\u2019s letting someone else live there for free, not girlfriend\u2019s problem.  You live somewhere, you pay."]}
