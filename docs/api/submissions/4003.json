For some reason rent is what she wants. If I pay 12k in rent, but the yearly cost of maintaining the home and paying its taxes is only 6k, then I\u2019d be losing 9k (12k-3k [my half of costs] = 9k loss) when I could be saving that toward retirement, buying a home together, a new vehicle, investing, etc.\n\n...\n\nHaving a written agreement (a lease) is never a bad thing. \n\n... \n\nI'm assuming for major repairs you'd also kick in half... So like the water heater goes out, you'd pay half... The roof eventually needs replaced you pay half... \n\nI also think that she is self protecting by asking for a rental agreement.
