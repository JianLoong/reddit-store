Well that is a *possibility*, but there\u2019s two sides to each coin. If there\u2019s a chance he\u2019ll be a predator then there\u2019s also a chance that he\u2019s not and the relationship he could have with your sister could be long-lasting and healthy.

I thought I was so grown up at 24 and would have probably reacted the same way as her. I had lived independently for 5 years, had a high responsibility job and thought I knew everything as a result. I was so wrong!\n\nI know not all age gaps are bad, my aunt and uncle started dating when he was 31 and she was 21 but have had a really supportive and loving marriage. But more often than not it ends up being damaging to some degree to the person with less life experience.", "NTA. However, I had a similar situation with my best friend dating a much older man. Everyone else was telling her what a bad idea it was and I could see them being removed from her life. I made myself her support in whatever decision she made and when his mask slipped and he started abusing her, she came to me and let me convince her to tell her parents and leave.

That the 80 yo guy benefits less from your mother's age. This is a hard and scary situation.\n\nYoung adults think they're really special, and that no-one else in the entire world has ever felt what they feel, and groomers and predators use this knowledge.

I agree with you, it's a huge red flag for a 36 y/o man to date a girl in her early 20s.", "NTA\n\n>that she was more mature than most girls her age\n\nSure. They all say this. \n\nLook, ppl in their early 20ies will never believe you when you tell them their brains didn't developed into fully adult yet. They see themself as very adult, even more adult than actual adults. They know everything better than everyone else and are convinced they have enough life experience already. I guess its how it has to be :) And in your sisters case she feels especially adult and mature since a middle 30 man is interested in her. \n\nYou warned her, she doesn't want to listen.
