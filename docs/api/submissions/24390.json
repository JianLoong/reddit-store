I immediately asked her to please cancel the date as in my opinion no guy that age has good intentions with a girl her age, and it's a huge red flag.\n\nShe brought up our mother who's in her late 60s going on a date with a guy in his 80s to which I responded that it was completely different as they are fully formed, fully matured adults who likely have similar life goals.\n\nShe then said I was being a hypocrite, that she was more mature than most girls her age, called me a judgemental asshole and stormed off.\n\nThis isn't the first time we've had an argument about this kind of thing, the last time was about her ex who she started dating when she was 15/16 and he was 18/19 (can't recall the exact ages). Both times she's called me a judgemental asshole.\n\nI say what I say out of concern, as I genuinely just don't trust the kinds of guys she tends to go for, but am I overstepping when I call this sort of thing out?\n\nUPDATE:\nHad a chat with my sister. Apologized for being judgemental and overbearing, as well as for telling her what to do. Reaffirmed my concern her and for the situation but said that ultimately I recognize that she's an adult and can make her own decisions, and the last thing I ever want to do is push her away or make her feel like she can't talk to me. She also apologized for reacting in the way that she did and for storming off. We hugged it out.

She may still be young but she IS an adult, so you should discuss your concerns with her adult to adult. Listen and respond with kindness and express your concerns as exactly that, concerns.

Well that is a *possibility*, but there\u2019s two sides to each coin. If there\u2019s a chance he\u2019ll be a predator then there\u2019s also a chance that he\u2019s not and the relationship he could have with your sister could be long-lasting and healthy.

I'd say all you're going to do is drive her harder into this relationship. I'd recommend that you stop passing judgement on all her BFs and just be there and supportive.

I thought I was so grown up at 24 and would have probably reacted the same way as her. I had lived independently for 5 years, had a high responsibility job and thought I knew everything as a result. I was so wrong!\n\nI know not all age gaps are bad, my aunt and uncle started dating when he was 31 and she was 21 but have had a really supportive and loving marriage. But more often than not it ends up being damaging to some degree to the person with less life experience.", "NTA. However, I had a similar situation with my best friend dating a much older man. Everyone else was telling her what a bad idea it was and I could see them being removed from her life. I made myself her support in whatever decision she made and when his mask slipped and he started abusing her, she came to me and let me convince her to tell her parents and leave.

That the 80 yo guy benefits less from your mother's age. This is a hard and scary situation.\n\nYoung adults think they're really special, and that no-one else in the entire world has ever felt what they feel, and groomers and predators use this knowledge.

I agree with you, it's a huge red flag for a 36 y/o man to date a girl in her early 20s.", "NTA\n\n>that she was more mature than most girls her age\n\nSure. They all say this. \n\nLook, ppl in their early 20ies will never believe you when you tell them their brains didn't developed into fully adult yet. They see themself as very adult, even more adult than actual adults. They know everything better than everyone else and are convinced they have enough life experience already. I guess its how it has to be :) And in your sisters case she feels especially adult and mature since a middle 30 man is interested in her. \n\nYou warned her, she doesn't want to listen.

The one difference is a guy in his mid to late 30s can control himself a lot more than a guy in his 20s. Maybe that\u2019s what she sees in him? With younger guys sex is ALL that is on their minds.
