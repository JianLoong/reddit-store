How rude!\"\n\nThey can raise their own son however they want but they need to accept the consequences that come with their parenting style.", "NTA\n\nWhat a terrible situation for this poor kid who isn't being told he's doing anything wrong. What are these parents thinking? This kid is going to get punished, possibly even suspended or expelled at school if he swears at teachers. How would she feel about adults constantly swearing at her child? Does she think it's okay for to go into work and swear at coworkers and  your boss too since apparently vocabulary shouldn't be censored? Or is it only kids that get a free pass to swear and adults don't? That just seems absolutely insane to me!\n\nSo I feel for the kid, but ultimately, you wouldn't invite an adult to a kids party who was f\\*ing and cursing them out and you shouldn't invite a child either. Just focus on the fact that you're protecting your child and the other children and it's not you excluding your nephew, it's your brother and his wife excluding their child.", "NTA\n\nAlmost all kids go through a phase where they want to gain attention from cursing but if the parents are straight up enabling it, then it's different", "NTA! Your brother should find a way of explaining that there are different boundaries in different social situations, and swearing isn't allowed in some places - like schools, some homes, even future workplaces, etc. Even if they think it's silly, and that swearing should be allowed everywhere, this child deserves the tools to adapt to different environments. I hope that your son enjoys his party!", "NTA\n\nShe has a right not to censor his language, but that doesn't mean that you have to invite that kind of language into your home or accept it to impact your parenting.\nShe doesn't want to budge even a tiny bit on her ideals, but expects everyone to adjust their morals for her.
