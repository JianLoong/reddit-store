Not letting them be without structure", "Yeeep. I was nowhere near as young when I was allowed to/wasn't punished for swearing (about 12) but it's become part of my vocab. Its been a good decade and I still have to remind myself to consider my surroundings before I start using colourful language.", "Yeah worked at the community pool when I was a teen (fantastic summer job) and you weren't allowed to cuss which was really hard for some of my coworkers but could get you in big trouble if a patron complained.", "So I fully believe there\u2019s no problem with swearing. I swear constantly around my kids (8 and 5) and I\u2019ve made it clear that I do not care if they swear *at home when others aren\u2019t around.* They are both able to understand that there\u2019s behavior okay in your home with immediate family, and behavior that you are careful with in public. My kids have never sworn. \n\nNTA. It\u2019s your right to raise your kids with whatever level of exposure you think is fair. I don\u2019t \u201ccensor\u201d my kids but my kids know that behaviors have consequences.", "For some reason, I read the comments first. And they felt harsh. And THEN I went up and read and was like: oh no yah... \n\nBecause we let our kids use profanity. Even the 5-yr-old gets to. But like, there are 100% nuances to this level of maturity. We have been *very clear* from day one, that there are many many people and many many instances where consequences will happen if you use those words. School. Friends homes where it's off limits. Grandma's house, she doesn't like them. We don't use cuss words AT each other. You don't use cuss words AGAINST other people. They're for expression, they're for instances of pain. And they better be contextually accurate and intellectually placed. And the 5-yr-old *very much understands these rules.* She has a mature conversational ability and I'm telling you, has never once incorrectly used those words. Like she waited to use them until she understood them. So we *all* practice those same rules. And we've been very clear that if they ever face consequences because they abused the rules... We're not saving them. \n\nAll of that to say, I'm a big fan of profanity \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f But it can and needs to be used responsibly. It's not your job to have to explain to all the other guests why he gets to behave as if he's mature enough to use words like that, but clearly is not. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s being ridiculous. There are certain words you don\u2019t use in polite society, whether adult or child. \n\nI wish I could watch him during a job interview! \n\nDon\u2019t be manipulated by guilt into inviting him. For you and everyone at the party\u2019s sake, and side effect, because he needs to learn to take rejection. \n\nShe\u2019s free to parent badly, and you\u2019re free to reject them for the same reason.", "He's going to hear it, probably already has. At 5 you can teach we don't say that in our family. We love everyone even when they don't follow our rules. NAH", "NTA. But a harsh truth: your son will learn all the curse words, and much sooner than you want. That\u2019s life. Still, doesn\u2019t mean you should have to tolerate that, so good on you for establishing boundaries.", "NTA. Tell sil the following: you are free to let your kiddo have a potty mouth while I am free to decide who gets to be in my home.", "Wow.  Curse words is what stops you from treating the child nicely?  If he swears in another language that you don't know, would you treat it the same way?  Sounds like a great time to teach your own kids what you find to be acceptable is different than what other people may find acceptable.", "NTA the other parents will 100% complain. I\u2019ve seen it happen. These people are in for a lot of fights about this that kid will stop getting invited birthday parties and play dates and they are not doing him any favors.", "just wait until he swears at the wrong person", "NTA", "NTA She doesn\u2019t want to \u201ccensor\u201d his vocabulary and you don\u2019t want profane language used in your home by children so it makes no sense to invite him", "At home our child is not \"censored\" and they, as well as me and my husband all use cuss words. Home is a safe place to be yourself. However, we also know people have hang ups about certain words. One can't cuss in school, work, etc. We have taught our child that they have to read a room, so to speak, as to when they can and can not use any language they want. In public they are extremely polite and respectful. At home cuss like a sailor. So the parents that refuse to censor the child at all are doing their child a huge disservice, and I know from experience you can teach a child when and where to cuss. \n\nA young child's birthday party is a prime example of when and where not to cuss. So NTA, your house, your rules. Yes, you are specifically excluding your nephew, but it is a lesson he can learn from that you can't cuss all the time when and wherever you are.", "My brother and SIL told us not to censor around my nieces.  One is going to be 20 and one 18, and they don't even say \"ass.\"  It's all about the parenting.", "Yup, my husband had two rules as a kid.  First it had to be in context.  It couldn't be an attack or just to be irritating.  Second was not around other adults.  His mom didn't want to have to deal with another parent or a teacher complaining.", "My favorite parenting tweet ever was when a three year old walked into a Petco, saw a snake for the first time in real life and said, \"Are you fucking serious?\"", "This. I apologize. My kids are allowed to express when they think I'm wrong. I give them the respect of introspection, just as I would with my peers. But they also have to be good listeners, and be willing to receive the same kind of open discussion. We talk about how to be a good friend all of the time. And the kind of people we want to be. And the kind of friends we'd like to have. My husband and I will regularly converse about the girls' media that we overhear. We like to ask them thought provoking questions. And get their input on what they would do differently. It can open up really neat dialogues. I learn from our girls all the time as a result.", "NTA if they don\u2019t want to \u201ccensor\u201d their child then they have to deal with the consequences that come with that.", "You can set house rules.\n\u201cIn my house we \u2026\u201d\nIt will be good practice for when the child starts school and can\u2019t talk like a longshoreman.\nGood grief.\nI am imagining the parents giving that explanation to a teacher.\nYou are NTA but it is unfortunate for the child.", "my god, i am always amazed that such people exist. \n\nPerhaps tell her she doesn't really understand what any of these words mean, censor, bully...\n\nNTA.", "Kids that came to my house were corrected if their parents didn\u2019t because it was my house and if I were OP I\u2019d do the same thing. \u201cBilly, we don\u2019t use curse words in this house, you need to find other words to express your emotions\u201d.  Something to that effect is said every single time and if he cannot speak properly he can and should be removed from the party and go into another room and/or outdoors until he can control himself.  I\u2019m guessing though this would create drama with the brother and SIL so it\u2019s best for them not to come.  Yes, parents are failing this kid, school and other things (sport teams, clubs, etc\u2026) will not put up with it.", "See, OP is not expecting her to. OP is asking her to. She can agree, or not agree. Ball's in her court.", "Ehhhh, how big a deal cursing is is entirely dependent on where you live. And how problematic is is in regards to being excluded or not is completely dependent on the rest of the kid's personality. \n\nThe very sweetest nicest boy in my daughter's class, the gentlest soul, always looking out for others, especially the ones who might not be able to fend for themselves as well, has the biggest mouth on him. He regularly does get in trouble with the teacher because his language has gone too far, but he never gets excluded by anyone because he truly is the nicest kid around and all the kids AND parents love him. \nNow if the kid in OP's post is a giant jerk in addition to having a mouth on him, the parents are screwing him up, but that wasn't mentioned anywhere, just the profanity.", "OP needs to weaponise the child.\n\nMake sure they know all the worst words and how to use them, and to say them liberally and loudly when with their parents and in public.\n\nIt won't take long for it to change.", "Yeah, it\u2019s really important that kids are taught about context in regards to behavior. Little kids aren\u2019t going to pick up on those nuances on their own.", "OP pretty obviously lives in an area where children swearing isn\u2019t socially acceptable."]}
