She mentioned how her fianc\u00e9 had a wife, and they were in the process of getting a divorce (which I don\u2019t believe is the full story) but the wife found out about her so he left the kids and the wife and is now engaged to my friend who is nineteen. He is fifty three. I know it\u2019s her personal life, and she didn\u2019t ask my opinion so I did not give it, and it doesn\u2019t change the fact that she is very kind to me and pleasant to spend time with, but at the end of the day that rubbed the wrong way that she admitted to \u201ctearing apart a family\u201d, and she wants me to meet her fianc\u00e9. I know I would not be able to look him in the eyes without physically gagging and saying some not so kind things, because what is a almost 60 year old man doing with a freshly legal girl?

I've done that when I was younger but as I've gotten older it's been a learning tool that I wish I had used growing up as an adult and things would have been a much easier time in dealing with friendships and relationships that were similar to what you've dealt with.  You have free will, like we all do, but you always have to ask yourself when you meet someone, \"am I going to get something worthwhile out of this relationship?\"", "NTA. This \u201crelationship\u201d has next to zero chance of working out. Protect yourself and your own well being.

But instead of \"leaning back\", at least let her know that the situation makes you uncomfortable *for your own reasons*, *your own traumas*, and so that's why you'll be keeping some distance.", "NTA. I would still be honest with her and tell her that your feelings are because of your own experiences. But if being around her and her fiancee is going to be a problem for you, you don't owe her anything in terms of loyalty. She's not your bestie, she's a new friend. And if this would have a negative effect on your mental health and the friendship, then you have to protect yourself. \n\nI will add that you telling her your reasons should not turn into a \"come-to-Jesus\" talk about her relationship with her fiancee. It should be focused on your own mental health and traumas and not you convincing her to leave him (even if you think she should).\n\nThere's nothing wrong with you protecting your own mental health and knowing that this new friendship is only going to harm that. I had to stop being friends with a long-time friend because her boyfriend was so toxic and impossible to be around that I literally had rules that I wouldn't hang out with her when he was around because it wrecked my mental health (and was just exhausting to be around). \n\nGood luck, and I hope your friend eventually realizes on her own that this relationship is iffy. I definitely understand how you feel, but it's not going to change her decisions. She has to see it for herself, unfortunately.", "This happened to me fresh out of highschool. My best friend started dating a guy who was 25 years older than her, she was 18, he was 47. He gave me the creeps but it wasn\u2019t my business. I still hung out with her though, just without him.
