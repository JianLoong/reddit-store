So my sister received a couple of ultimatums, the first was from her fiance who told her that if she didn't apologize for how she acted and what she said, that he would call off the wedding. She half assed it bit I accepted it because shes annoying enough already. In my previous post people believed my parents were transphobic for not taking a side, bit they aren't, they have been nothing but kind to my gf. Me and my sister are their only kids and they want grandkids, I never want kids and I've made thus clear. My sister wants a big family, and my parents have reasoned that I'd she does throw a kid out for being gay and or trans that they could take them in if that ever happened.\n\nMy parents asked me if they would be OK with them going to her wedding, I gave them my blessing (which felt weird asf ngl) and they gave my sister an ultimatum, either she invites me or they dont go, she relented and reinvited me but not my gf so I'm still not going but my parents will, I'm fine with this compromise. My parents have set aside some money and told me to take my gf on a nice date that night, so my plan is to take her to dinner and then we get to see a movie opening night. My sister's wedding fell on the same day as the movie so it all worked out I guess. Me and my gf are still together, she's currently wrecking people In smash with me while I type this. All in all life is good, after her apologies I have gone no contact with my sister, I unfortunately haven't been in contact with her fiance which sucks because I've known him since I was little but I have a feeling he understands. Anyway that's the update, have a damn good one guys.", "created_utc": 1688067262, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14me5t0/aita_update_aita_for_not_going_to_my_sisters/", "score": 1299, "replies": ["You're a good person.

Oh, hey it doesn't matter if she would make a gay or trans kid's life hell because we would take this child once she damaged it sufficiently and rejected it. \n\nDo you know HOW FUCKED UP that is? They're comfortable with encouraging her to bring a child into the world that she might drop like a hot rock if it's not the right gender or orientation? And how do you think that child will feel about it? What would that do to that kid for the rest of their lives to have a parent treat them like that? Even if grandma and grandpa would take them in (and who could in fact be dead or unable to care for a child by then)? And your sister's fiance is willing to marry a rampant transphobe provided she tones it down a little in public. I am sorry to say they are not actually good allies and you should be careful of relying on them for support long term. \n\nIt felt weird to give your blessing for them to still go to the wedding because they KNOW it's a problem so they wanted you to tell them it was okay and they weren't really transphobic. It's deeply wrong to put that on your to alleviate their own guilt. And if you hadn't said you were okay with it, then it would be your fault they didn't go.", "You're a good person!  Your parents suck tho.  Imagine supporting a transphobic person and being like \"It's okay.  If they are hateful to my grandkids I'll take em in.\" Who has that mentality?

No, thanks.", "Sadly, I doubt her marriage will last, given her bigotry, but I'm glad to hear things are going well with the rest of your family and your gf.", "Right? Oh no matter if she fucks up the poor kid for life and it has to go through the experience of being rejected by its own mother. It'll be FINE.

They can't stop her from being a bigot and they can't stop her from having children.

Like I really don't see what you think is so bad about supporting any possible LGBT grandchildren.", "for real!! like this is high-key virtue signaling imo. if they actually cared, they would never be okay with their daughter treating anyone to the point of of disowning them, *especially her own children!*", "[removed]", "It's not bad to support their potential queer grandchildren. Of course if it falls out that way, they should. I WISH I'd had grandparents who were there for me when my parents told me I was going to hell for being gay. But I'd have much preferred grandparents who drew a hard line on homophobia with my parents before I was born and made clear that kind of treatment of people was unacceptable to them. The wording that implies they want grandchildren so bad they'll overlook virtually any behavior from their daughter because she is the only one will give them grandchildren. And that they want their minor son to make them feel better about this by giving them \"permission\" to overlook their behavior, thereby burdening him with responsibility for their relationship to his sister.  It's gross.", "So they ditch the bigoted daughter and cut her off, then if she DOES have a kid that\u2019s LGBTQ+ they won\u2019t have immediate access to a stable support system? Sticking around to protect the grandchildren isn\u2019t virtue signaling.", "And then putting that on the son! \"Well, we won't go unless you make us feel better about it...\" Honestly, it's gross.", "Yes.

Obsessing over others genitals is fucking weird.", "[removed]", "Did anyone suggest they cut off the daughter entirely?

Sister if you find this: I hope you are ashamed of yourself. I hope everyone at your wedding asked where your brother is and I hope you are embarrassed to say that you are bigot and that\u2019s why your brother isn\u2019t at your wedding. But you probably aren\u2019t. You will regret being transphobic.", "Out if curiosity, WHY did she tell your parents? It\u2019s really not their business.", "I cant believe her fiance is going through with the wedding", "It\u2019s depressing that they are already thinking about it potential future", "The fact that they are still going to the wedding is terrifying. They are so desperate for grandkids that they are willing to not support their son and his gf; they chose a transphobic asshole over their son because grandkids.", "That part still doesn't make sense to me. It's literally seeing grandkids as objects at that point.", "I\u2019m a chick married to a (cis) chick but when talking to a trans female friend of ours said I just assumed that \u201csex stuff would get figured out, it\u2019s just body parts\u201d and she told me she was shocked and very happy to hear that \u201ccoming from a lesbian\u201d. I\u2019m like\u2026 you\u2019re a lady. I like ladies. A little moot given my relationship status, but seriously don\u2019t understand what people get so bent out of shape over.\n\n/except for women with legit sexual trauma that have some issues with certain organs. That\u2019s a whole other issue that needs its own massive nuanced conversation.", "I mean, they aren't allies, and they don't really pretend to be. They care for OP, because he is their son, not because he is a good person. Likewise, they care about their daughter, **despite** her not being a good person. This is paired with them wanting to have grandkids that they fully intend to care for as well. It is a selfish approach to life, but it does not mean OP can't rely on her parents to support him, well as long as it does involve alienating his sister.\n\nMy mother has similar type of selfishness. There is one system of morality for the general population and the other for her family and close friends. She has at one point suspected I might be gay and professed full support in that regard. I am not gay, for that matter. Recently, however, she has spewed quite a few homophobic remarks. Not because she is homophobic per se, but she has remarried, and her new husband's son has recently come out as gay, and her husband is not exactly taking it well. You could say she is his emotional support instead of arguing with him over it.\n\nAs awful as it may be, I don't intend to do anything about it or condemn anyone of them. I am selfish too, and my mother is most happy since I can remember and given her awful life I am grateful  that at least at her old age, she has met someone that makes her happy.\n\nPoint is, this really isn't that simple, and them not alienating their daughter does not make them bad people.", "So how would this hard line on homophobia work in practice?", "Dude I wish you both a very happy relationship. You are a really great guy and she is very lucky to have someone like you in this world. Shout outs to your parents too, sounds like they are doing the best they can in a really shitty situation.
