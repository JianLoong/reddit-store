So my sister received a couple of ultimatums, the first was from her fiance who told her that if she didn't apologize for how she acted and what she said, that he would call off the wedding. She half assed it bit I accepted it because shes annoying enough already. In my previous post people believed my parents were transphobic for not taking a side, bit they aren't, they have been nothing but kind to my gf. Me and my sister are their only kids and they want grandkids, I never want kids and I've made thus clear. My sister wants a big family, and my parents have reasoned that I'd she does throw a kid out for being gay and or trans that they could take them in if that ever happened.\n\nMy parents asked me if they would be OK with them going to her wedding, I gave them my blessing (which felt weird asf ngl) and they gave my sister an ultimatum, either she invites me or they dont go, she relented and reinvited me but not my gf so I'm still not going but my parents will, I'm fine with this compromise. My parents have set aside some money and told me to take my gf on a nice date that night, so my plan is to take her to dinner and then we get to see a movie opening night. My sister's wedding fell on the same day as the movie so it all worked out I guess. Me and my gf are still together, she's currently wrecking people In smash with me while I type this. All in all life is good, after her apologies I have gone no contact with my sister, I unfortunately haven't been in contact with her fiance which sucks because I've known him since I was little but I have a feeling he understands. Anyway that's the update, have a damn good one guys.", "created_utc": 1688067262, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14me5t0/aita_update_aita_for_not_going_to_my_sisters/", "score": 129, "replies": ["You're a good person.

It's great that they'd be willing to do that, but \"it's okay if she kicks out her kid, we'll just take them in\" is not actually a great mindset here. \n\nAnyway. You sound like a nice kid.
