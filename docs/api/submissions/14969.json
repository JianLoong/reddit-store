I\u2019m a quick thinker and I tend to not panic in dangerous situations. My fianc\u00e9 on the other hand is the exact opposite. If I\u2019m being nice I would say she does t have any awareness of danger. If I\u2019m being honest I would say that she has the survival instinct of panda raised in captivity. She had no sense of danger around her, doesn\u2019t constantly examine her surroundings for things that could be dangerous, and when things are bad, her reaction is to panic and scream.\n\nFriday we went out on a friend of mine\u2019s boat and we got into a dangerous situation. We were anticipating light rain but we ended up with a downpour high winds and high waves. While me and the other men there were trying to strap things down and keep the boat from capsizing. My fianc\u00e9e screamed and cried for dear life. She was in hysterics. And I get it was a scary situation but her yelling and screaming that \u201cwe\u2019re all gonna die\u201d and for god to save us and literally crying saying that it\u2019s my fault that she\u2019s on the boat since I asked her to come with. None of the other gfs or wives were doing this, just her. I\u2019m sure the other women there were just as scared but tried to keep It in for the sake of the men doing something about it.\n\nThe downpour was really bad for about 15 minutes. So 15 minutes of wailing while we are doing everything we can to keep things alright. We made it back safe with little more damage than a few spilled white claws. On the car ride home I told my fianc\u00e9e that we needed to talk about how she was behaving during the crisis. Not only was it incredibly embarrassing in front of my boys, but it was distracting, unhelpful, and telling. \n\nI told her that, today proved to me that if I was in a life or death situation, I could not rely on her to be any help or do anything except make things more stressful. I said she needed to learn how to not panic and be helpful.\n\nShe got unbelievably mad. She said she thought she was going to die and had reason to freak out. I told her that all of us were scared but none of us were as ridiculous as she was. We argued the entire ride home and she is still pissed off ar me.\n\nI think I was right to say this, especially since we plan on spending our lives together and raising a family and I can\u2019t be the only levelheaded one.\n\nAITA?\n\n\nEdit\n\nOh my fucking God. The women there did not help because they did not know how to help. The men there have been out together on the boat countless times before so we all are experienced and know exactly what to do. It\u2019s so much more unsafe for them to be in our way attempting to help if they don\u2019t really know what they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s safer for everyone if they just hang on and keep calm until the issue is resolved.\n\nThis has NOTHING to do with them being women. It has everything to do with them not knowing what to do. If another guy had been then and didn\u2019t know what to do, I\u2019d tell him to sit tight and let those of us  that do know handle it.", "created_utc": 1681671362, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12okuiy/aita_for_telling_my28_fianc\u00e9e29_that_i_could_not/", "score": 2420, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

F@#k yes. Did I instinctively know that panicking was the worse thing I could do? Another f@#k yes.\n\nMyself, the boss & one of the other girls working kept our heads pretty straight despite having a gun to our faces.... the other woman was SCREAMING bloody murder. High pitched shrieking, crying, yelling for her mother (she was in her 40s) to save her, etc etc.\nI couldn't help but thinking at the time that I would have shot her myself just to shut her up. I was terrified that her behavior was going to set them off & someone was gonna get shot.\n\nLuckily, no one was hurt in the incident, but you see who people really are when the chips are down.\n\nNta", "NTA - She can feel and react however she pleases, but that doesn't change the facts.\n\nSo you're correct. She was unhelpful and only made an already scary situation even more stressful.\n\nIt's indeed a very useful skill to have, to be able to think somewhat straight in a crisis situation. Or at the very least have the sense to not make it worse for those who are trying to help.", "Nta....she's the one in the movie that always dies first because they panic and run off into more danger. Maybe I'm just mean but, i get so irritated with people that panic in an emergency. Yeah, be scared, everyone is scared, but you panic, you die. That's an important lesson everyone needs to learn. Screaming and crying only makes situation worse, if you can't help then just sit down, shut up and do what the people who DO know what to do tell you.", "ESH. Maybe a little harsh, but true. Her reasoning of \u201cI thought I was going to die\u201d really only helps your point. Does she not understand that any **life or death** situation is going to feel like that?\n\n\nAlthough, you should probably be more concerned with your hysterical fianc\u00e9e thinking she\u2019s about to die, instead of what your friends are going to think.", "NTA. But...\n\nThis person is not built to be in situations where they could face trying circumstances.\n\nSurely, panicking was not helpful, but now you know your partner is not built for these sorts of activities. Does she want to expand her horizons? Test herself regularly? Push her boundaries? I bet the answer is no. If you have kids, will she want to stop you from mountain excursions? Or white-water rafting? Or even being on the water if there is a chance of inclement weather?\n\nIt sounds like you two have a significant lifestyle compatibility issue. Now, I think it's not exactly nice how you've spoken to her here.  What are your expectations of your partner?\n\nI think you need to ask yourself if it's reasonable to expect this specific person to be the kind of person  you need them to be in these specific circumstances.\n\nWe don't all act well in a crisis. I honestly don't think this person will change into the type of person you're expecting your partner to be. You can try to take her into less safe circumstances and slowly help her build resilience. But, if she doesn't cope well, berating her and shaming her is not going to make her feel like even trying.\n\nOh, by the way. For people who are not water people or experienced boaters, being in a nearly-capsizing boat with things flying overboard is a very shocking experience. I am not sure how you would expect someone who has never faced this situation to simply \"suck it up and either help or be quiet\". \n\nThat situation would scare me shitless and I am not sure how I would react. \n\nI would hope I would grit my teeth and help and focus on what needed doing, but honestly, I couldn't be sure.\n\nDo you think your partner will head into open water now with any chance of heavy weather in the forecast? And if she doesn't act bravely you'll come down on her?\n\nYou're seeing this as 100% her fault and that's problematic.", "ESH - Despite the fact that this sounds like a scene out of a movie and not particularly real, here goes:\n\n1. She\u2019s a very very soft AH for creating more chaos, confusion and fear in a bad situation but some people aren\u2019t emotionally strong so that is what it is. \n\n2. You\u2019re an AH for admonishing her for that. You seem to be into traditional gender roles, which is fine. The men take to action while the women are cowering in fear (again pretty movie-ish given that most of the women I know would have been helping make sure we avoided disaster and some of the men I know would be paralyzed with fear). But if this is your style then you should have been comforting her after a traumatic experience not shitting on her for playing her \u201crole.\u201d\n\n3. You\u2019re absolutely right you can\u2019t depend on her in an emergency situation but the car ride after a life or death scenario wasn\u2019t the time to bring that up.\n\nEdit: grammar clarity", "Not sure you handled the delivery well, but it's a fair concern. If you have children, she cannot freak out every time she is scared. Unfortunately she probably learned this from her parents, and well would pass it on.\n\nNTA, though the delivery sounds flawed. Would work on that, there is probably an apology needed there. You may need counseling on this, but ultimately it probably will never change. You just need to decide if it impacts your long term plans.", "You may have been harsh but 15 minutes of screaming/wailing would have pushed me over the top too. I understand being scared but screaming for that long in a situation where screaming will do absolutely nothing to help & will just add to the stress of the people actually trying to help makes me feel like your girlfriend is more of the AH. And yes, I have been in a similar situation. It definitely made me nervous to go back on a boat but nobody screamed like that.", "NTA.\n\nI was ready to come for you for the title, but her behavior isn\u2019t just bad in a crisis, it\u2019s actively harmful. This is why we do things like teach kids to feel doors before opening them in a fire, get outside to fresh air, etc. Its about being prepared in an emergency; we should all want to be better at that. \n\nWhere you could have handled this better, OP, is not having that conversation on the way home. Neither of you are going to be relaxed and receptive at that time. Next time, try waiting a day and coming at it without anger, and you\u2019ll get better results. That being said, your wife\u2019s behavior both during and after the incident was hurtful, harmful, and infuriating. She\u2019s the AH here, definitely, but I think you\u2019ll have better results if you are both willing to work on a change, rather than proving a point.", "NTA. That behavior is absolutely ridiculous. How does it help her to behave that way?  and it is definitely distracting for those trying to mitigate the situation. This is the one and only instance where dealing someone acting like that a bracing smack across the face is justified. And don\u2019t tell me she couldn\u2019t control\nherself because I don\u2019t  buy that for an instant. A five year old can be quiet - and often will be from instinct alone- in a dangerous situation. How does she explain the behavior of the other people\nthere who also thought they might die?  I am sorry to say that my mother is just like this and even as a child I absolutely could not trust her to behave rationally when bad things happened. Even a minor injury (to me/ not her) sent her wailing to her room and I had to take care of myself. Her mother (my grandma) told me that when they were in a car accident she stood there and screamed until her mother slapped her. She was totally uninjured but just only cared that SHE was scared, not that other people were also being affected. I once asked her why she acts like that in emergencies and basically the answer is \u201cbecause I feel like it and see no reason to try to control myself\u201d.", "NTA. You're absolutely correct that her behavior was unhelpful, and actually resulted in a more dangerous situation because of her distractions. I don't know if I could be with someone who has so little awareness. Maybe therapy can help, but being a person that enjoys outdoor activities that involve risks, not sure I would stick that out.", "NTA. My ex wife was very much the same way.  Actually a much quicker thinker in calm times than I (I tend to think things through before speaking or acting), but absolutely panics and goes into hysterics. \n\nOne time when our kids were roughly 8, 6 and 4, we were in the garage when we saw a rat on one of the rafters.  She totally panicked and shoved the kids out of the way as she ran into the house.  The kids were laughing at her reaction, and I just said \u201cWell, now you know who she saves first in an emergency.\u201d", "NTA. I work in public safety. I deal with screaming hysterical people on a daily basis, and oh boy let me tell you how much they are a hindrance and not a help\u2026. You wanna get hysterical cuz your new born baby isn\u2019t breathing? Hey I totally get it, but at the same time, it doesn\u2019t help me help you at all if you\u2019re so hysterical you can\u2019t tell me your location. You wanna get hysterical cuz there\u2019s a harmless possum in your yard? Nope nope nope, no patience for that anymore. Some people are just NOT good in stressful situations whether they be life or death or not. And this girl isn\u2019t.", "NTA\n\nAnd for the sake of all things holy to you ... do not have children with this woman.  I am being very serious.\n\nAs a VERY cool head in an emergency, and 2 grown kids, I can tell you that her impulse to panic is DANGEROUS when raising kids.  I won't elaborate because it's self evident.  I have calmly dealt with too many situations that would have ended poorly had I not been calm.\n\nAnd I totally understand why you would have the experienced boaters do the work  ... as an amateur boater, just get out of my way so I can deal properly.", " NTA. She needs to be told, and if she\u2019s to be your wife and future mother to your kids, then she needs to learn how to act correctly in those situation\u2019s should anything happen with said kids, rather than scream and cry we\u2019re all gonna die!", "NTA Honey, when people show you who they are believe them. She screamed it was all your fault because you invited her to spend the day on a boat. WTH? Run & find a grown up who may actually BE a partner.", "NTA reality checks are important.", "Nta run for the hills. Ain't going to improve if she thinks she is correct.", "NTA\n\nHaving the ability to take action in crisis is a massive advantage in life. You girlfriend reacted in the most unhelpful and annoying way possible.\n\nLet's not down play the other girlfriends. They hunkered down and tried to remain calm. That is also important in a crisis. \n\nEveryone here reacted in the best possible way, except your girlfriend.", "Idk man, it\u2019s kinda a dick move to get your partner into a terrifying situation then get mad when she\u2019s terrified. Then to berate her and question her life skills and parenting ability based on that, not a good look. You need to apologize. YTA.", "NTA - you said she always reacts that way. I could not stand this. Especially not, when she is blaming You. I see no future", "NAH. As you made clear in your first paragraph, you have two different temperaments. I don't think either of your reactions to what happened on the boat are wrong. You worked to get the situation under control; she was scared and thought she was going to die.\n\nSince you are so different, and neither of you seems to accept each others' temperaments, I think you would be better off splitting up. I think you are not compatible.", "NTA. It can make a dangerous situation even more dangerous with that kind of behavior. Honestly, I would have probably told her to sit down and shut up during it. My mother is similar to this\u2026when I was learning to drive she would hold on to the roof handle and her seatbelt and literally screech at every little jolt. She made a stressful situation more stressful (I would go like 40mph in a 35mph or I would tap my breaks harder than needed to stop-normal things new drivers do). She even got \u201cin trouble\u201d on a rollercoaster because she tried to throw her body across my younger siblings (even though all buckled in safely) and screamed we were all going to die. The worker had to basically tell her she shouldn\u2019t ride the rides if she had anxiety issues (I was young but all I remember is him saying anxiety and maybe not ideal for my mom). It\u2019s embarrassing. \n\nOne thing that helped, besides medication, was basically making my mom in charge of something during these times. Like in the car, my mom was the \u201cMapquest\u201d and radio person. Literally made her focus on this so she could control something.", "NTA! I'm a woman and she embarrassed our gender please tell her for me, that women like her are the reason men see us as lesser! Women like her are the reason they see us as weak and have no faith in our ability to care for ourselves let alone others! I've unfortunately been through life threatening situations, even in my youth! And not once have I panicked, cried and blamed others for the situation. If staying out of the way is the best way to help them so be it. But I'd have had trouble not throwing her overboard! Honestly her reaction, as a woman, disgusts me!", "YTA. \n\nYou yourself have described it as a dangerous situation. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re way more familiar with boats than she is and someone panicking at the prospect of a boat capsizing and ya know\u2026dying, is a natural response. She could easily also say that she can\u2019t rely on you to comfort her.\n\nThere are many different life or death scenarios and we don\u2019t really know how we are gonna react to each one until we are in them. I probably wouldn\u2019t be the best person to rely on if there was trouble on a plane as I have a fear of flying. But in medical emergencies, I\u2019m trained in first aid and have helped. \n\nYou also seem more bothered about how it looked to your \u201cboys\u201d than anything else.", "NTA", "NTA. Does she often make it all about her? This reeks of center of attention syndrome.", "NTA I would've been completely useless in this situation but loosing control like that would only make things worse. I hope someone tried to calm her down. I agree your comments could be delivered better. This is something you both need to work on because emergencies will happen in life and if her one move is to panic it can be dangerous", "I Mean I understand you completely so NTA I cannot stand being around someone who screams and cries in a tense situation because that only makes things worst and chaotic I hate that shit in movies too lol and the fact that she was blaming you also is crazy too she needs to check herself and apologize for that", "Survival instincts of a panda raised in captivity \n\nAs a panda, I take offense to this. Your gf is more like a chicken with its head cut off, running around causing more problems than helping.  \n\nNTA for pointing out how she was a hindrance in an emergency situation. Not sure how long how long your relationship is going to last when you know you cannot count on the other person in emergency.", "NTA She sounds histrionic.", "Nta. Just dump her", "NTA\n\nOn the plus side you now know the person most likely to start sacrificing people in the store, or at least be all of no help in preventing that when the Mist creatures start attacking.", "NTA ask yourself if this is who you want to bear & raise your children. Being scared & crying out is one thing but carrying on for 15-20 minutes is another.", "Why are you with her?", "If you told a guy acting hysterical in this situation that you can\u2019t trust him with your life people would not be calling you a misogynist, but since it\u2019s a woman then I guess you have no right to tell her this. What happened to equality? Why can\u2019t he expect her to act calm instead of a 1940 movie damsel in distress?", "NTA! Forget embarrassing, (hope you didn't lead with that) it was beyond unhelpful. If the boat had tipped she would have dragged you along with her to drown.\n\nI'm in a similar relationship with the genders switched. Just deleted some examples which were leading me off-topic, suffice to say arguing won't help. Some people don't have good survival instinct and reflexes. She is unlikely to change, and it's best you accept that and make a decision from there. You will be the only level headed one. What happens if one of your future kids gets hurt or sick and you're not there?", "YTA\n\nWhy did you and \"your boys\" think it was a good idea to be on a boat if it going to rain? Are you all that dumb to not understand that you put yourselves in a life or death situation or are you just going to be blaming your fiancee?", "What exactly was your aim with this discussion? Because it sounds to me like you wanted to put your fianc\u00e9 in her place, rather than talk about her traumatic experience and try to understand what happened with her, so that you could help her manage her stress response better next time.\n\nFace it, you were absolutely not trying to help at all by bringing this up with her in the way you did. You were not solutions focused, you wanted to assign blame and guilt.\n\nThink about one thing though: You're not even helping yourself by doing this, because now you've only put extra doubt in your fianc\u00e9's mind the next time any situation comes up.\n\nYTA to your fianc\u00e9 and to yourself in the long run. I'm not even touching the misogynistic overtones in your post - other commenters will cover that better.\n\nBrace yourself to get absolutely clobbered by AITA on this one.", "ESH\n\nYou could have said it in a different way, or maybe waited until the initial shock of the day had worn off a bit. You could have comforted her or checked in on how she was feeling after first too. \n\nShe definitely could have reacted differently too, but people can't always change the way they react to stressful things. \n\nAlso, something about the way you talk about the \"men\" handling it reads a little misogynistic..", "Ok, I hear what you\u2019re saying. You wish she had your back when it\u2019s dangerous rather than throw her hands up in the air and panic. My mom is like that. When she use to drive, if she saw a dangerous situation up ahead, she\u2019d take her hands off the wheel and closed her eyes ( which is why she has not driven in a long time) and she panics at everything. Is it annoying, yes. Is it unhelpful, yes. But there\u2019s nothing anyone can do to change that instinct. But that\u2019s how your fianc\u00e9 reacts. No one is perfect. When you love someone you accept who they are, imperfections and all. Ask yourself if you can handle that for the rest of your life. Maybe you guys are not a good match.", "Gonna be honest, absolutely NTA. She reacted poorly in a dangerous situation, making it even more stressful, and she needed to know that what she did wasn\u2019t okay. She can be scared, but if she\u2019s acting like it\u2019s the end of the world and having a panic attack, she needs to get some therapy to help contain those reactions. \n\nShould you have been harsh? Not necessarily, but sometimes you\u2019re stressed and sometimes words come out bad.", "I\u2019m going with NTA. Her hysterics were not helping at all and could serve as a distraction. I also feel like this is how she is. She\u2019s 28. She\u2019s not going to change unless she wants to change.", "NAH.  Both of your reactions are justified and understandable, but you both need to do something about it.\n\nHer freaking out is completely understandable, as is your concern.  Part of being an adult is learning to stay in control of yourself during a dangerous situation, even if you are losing control of your emotions.  Actively getting in the way of you trying to help the current, dangerous situation by losing control and blaming you is absolutely not the way to handle that.  She does, however, have a right to be afraid and angry.\n\nYour concern is also justified.  Seeing her lose control during a situation like that is NOT a good sign.  Whether or not she embarrassed you is irrelevant.\n\nBoth of you need to untangle your personal emotions - her, her fear and blame towards you and recognize she needs to learn to control herself and you that your personal embarrassment is not her fault.  The core of the issue is that if a dangerous situation is at hand, it's an all-hands-on-deck situation; if either can help, do it; and if you can't get out of the way.  In the aftermath, you need to work on understanding each others' emotions and supporting each other.", "NAH\n\nYou're allowed to want a level headed partner in a crisis, bit you got to realise that is never ever going to be her\n\nHer fear response is panic. Your response is to try and do something. Both responses are well within the scope of human fear responses and totally normal.\n\nEveryone has their own response. Some people jump into danger and try to safe total strangers, most people will not do that. Your fianc\u00e9e's response is on the total opposite side of the spectrum. She panics so badly that she would not be able to safe herself and probably makes things worse. \n\nHuman fear response is a spectrum. All responses are valid. Now you have to figure out if her fear response is a deal breaker for you. It's allowed to be, but you should not shame her for it. Your fear response is not something you can help. It's primal.", "NTA, it's fine for her to be scared but for her to be actively distracting and distressing everyone else is dangerous. what's she going to do if she has kids in the future and something bad happens to them? you've made a perfectly reasonable assessment here.", "NTA but you knew this side of her and yet you still asked her to spend the rest of your lives together? So why is this just bothering you now? I for one don\u2019t think I could raise kids with someone who\u2019s going to freak out or panic any time a child got hurt. I\u2019d get some premarital counseling before I actually married the woman.", "YTA\n\nIf you really had good situational awareness, you wouldn't have been on a boat during a thunderstorm.\n\nHer response, while loud, wasn't really unreasonable. A boat on a lake is one of the most unsafe places to be during a thunderstorm. And if there is lightning nearby, it's even more dangerous. \n\nFurthermore, you're not her father. Don't treat her like a child. You sound like you were more concerned about how you looked in front of your boys than her safety.", "Info: had she ever been on the boat before? Does she know what to do in the case of a storm like the one you were caught in?\n\nIf not, then it's no surprise that she panicked the way she did. She wouldn't have known what to do, and in the moment, it can be very hard to stay calm.\n\nIf the answer is yes, then she definitely could have handled the situation better.\n\nI'm going to go with soft YTA, if only because one incident does not mean that she can't be relied on.

Great job putting yourselves in danger. YTA", "NTA. She can behave however she likes but you told her the truth. That kind of behaviour in a dangerous situation is at best unhelpful and irritating and at worst really fucking dangerous. \n\nSo you're planning on getting married? Are you planning on having kids? Because let me tell you her attitude will make every bump/bruise/allergy with your child into a waking nightmare. She's gotta calm down!", "NTA, number one rule for any sort of dangerous situation is not to panic and stay calm, if somebody is there trying to fix the situation you stay out of there way and for the love of god, do not interfere, that is fastest way for things to get much quicker. You find somewhere safe and you stay there until told otherwise, which is exactly what everyone but your wife did", "NTA, but with the caveat that situational awareness includes checking the weather forecast, and regular passengers on a boat should have basic safety training for these events.\n\n I'm somewhat confused about all the comments that say YTA and that some peoples' \"natural reaction\" to danger is panicking, crying, screaming, whatever. It doesn't matter if it is someone's natural reaction, it still makes them an enormous burden and yes, unreliable in a crisis. If you are someone who actively runs around panicking, screeching, and wailing during a crisis, you should at least have the good grace to admit that this makes you at best USELESS during a crisis and at worst, actively endangering everyone around you.", "NTA\n\nI have no idea if you are planning on children but my question is how would she react if there was a danger to the child? Scream and cry? There is absolutely nothing to gain by how she was acting. I mean, the other people on board were just as scared and yet no one else was behaving that way.", "NTA, invoking imaginary friends to save the boat is a bit of a fail", "Maybe train with her. While not a woman, my husband sucks with anything that requires thinking under pressure. We made a home invasion plan, and his job is to call 911 while I clear the house. During training he couldn\u2019t relay information properly, so I wrote a script for him and walk him through how to do it. I have done the same thing with him for first aid, and fires as well.

And she doesn't watch movies.\n\nI am very calm in real emergencies (dissociated, thanks to growing up with my mom, ha) -- like, way calmer than in real life.  In not-actual-emergency situations (like hearing a car horn) I react like what you just said.  I speak calmly and behave oddly, because I forget how to do basic things.\n\nSo I actually agree with him that she can't be acting like this around kids, 'cause that'll mess with a kid.

One girl was panicked in our situation, didn't scream but kept saying OMG loudly everytime the boat tipped a bit. So the 'boat-useless' person nearest took the role of comforting and distracting her.

He was embarrassed and upset with her.  I believe he lashed out with the intent of making an impact, of *making her see* how bad her actions were.  That was never going to end well.  Many people suck at taking criticism, but no one is going to respond well when it's brought up the way he did.  At a minimum, he needed to wait until they were both calm.\n\nAnd lol my mom is in her 80s, she ain't changing. :)  But these folks are young, hopefully they can work through it.", "What I would be asking \u2018the boys\u2019 though is why didn\u2019t any of the other three people onboard and unable to help the guys help the chick making things worse?

Maybe they were barely holding it together themselves? I don\u2019t know. Personally I would\u2019ve screamed at her to sit down and stfu. Maybe stop screaming and blaming others and then helped her breath through it once I got through to her. Sadly yelling will be the only way to do that sometimes.", "Where the hell do you get off trying to put forth such a reasonable question and opinion? Sheesh..."]}
