I found one that seemed promising, and went in for a trial class.\n\nFor reference, I have some trauma in the past that makes me uncomfortable touching women. I am in therapy for it, but that\u2019s not an instant cure, so that problem persists even though I\u2019ve made good progress in other aspects. \n\nAt my old gym this was understood and respected by everybody, and I hoped the same would be true here. I told the instructor beforehand and he was okay with it. When it came time for sparring, a girl asked if I wanted to spar with her. I politely said no and found another partner.\n\nAfter class she walked up to me and asked why I didn\u2019t spar with her, so I just explained I had some trauma about touching women. She got angry and said that I was being sexist and an AH. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It wasn't' a sexual thing and I certainly had all the respect in the world for the abilities of these women (who were all advanced compared to me), but I simply didn't enjoy it.
