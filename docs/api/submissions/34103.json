Dating is generally frowned upon and her family does not know we are in a long term relationship. Because of this, it is common for her to be unable to attend events/travel with my family/friends or invite me to events with her family/friends. \n\nFor NYE, my girlfriend was going to be celebrating with her community. They celebrate every year, however; due to a death in the family, they were not celebrating this year. We just found out they wouldn't be celebrating about \\~1.5 weeks ago. Upon learning this, I told my girlfriend I wanted to celebrate with her because we never get to celebrate, and she responded with \"We'll see, I'm not sure\". \n\nI brought it up 2 more times, and she gave the same response. This is normal for us, due to her traditional background. She has to come up with excuses any time she is away from home, so she often doesn't confirm plans with me until 1-2 days before some get together or event. Sometimes, she never updates me, so I wait around to get an answer from her and never receive one until I bring it up. \n\nFor this situation, my friend informed me earlier this week that he would be doing a get together for NYE. This isn't a \"party\" by any means. Its maybe \\~10/12 of us and some significant others. But majority are guys and we've all known each other for years. Its common for us to do cookouts, movie nights, etc together. I told my friend that I would attend his get together, but my girlfriend is unsure if she will be able to attend. \n\nMy girlfriend is now saying that AITA because I RSVP'd for myself without her, and told them she would \"let me know\" when she can (even though she sometimes never even gives me any answer). In her mind, because I did that, it \"makes no difference whether she's there or not because I already confirmed\" and I \"act like I'm single because I go to these events by myself\". My girlfriend said this as she was on the way to the club to go out with her girlfriends, but says I \"act like I'm single\". I feel like I am not TA because my friend wanted to confirm as many people as possible so they could plan the get together accordingly, and I planned to go to the get together even if my GF couldn't attend, because we originally weren't going to celebrate together in the first place, keeping in mind that this isn't some \"house party\", its a group of \\~8 guys that all know each other, and 2 of their girlfriends. She has now broken up with me for the n'th time because of this. So Reddit... AITA?

Your reply to your friend was completely reasonable given that your gf can't/won't commit until the last minute. It's odd, too, that her family is supposedly very \"traditional\" but she's on her way out to the club while giving you a hard time about trying to make a plan to see her. Are you sure her keeping you on the hook until the last minute is really due to family and not just keeping her options open? This behavior isn't reasonable or respectful to you - I hope she's worth it, OP.", "YTA for staying with her. Do you get that she uses her traditions and community to disrespect you.  Your relationship can\u2019t go to the next level because she will never choose you. She gaslights and manipulates you any time you show some independence. Saying, \u201cI\u2019ll let you know\u201d and then dragging it out, leaves you just waiting for her all of the time. How long are you going to wait?", "NTA. Do you ever ask yourself what is the end goal for this relationship? Hide from her family forever? It doesn't sound feasible to me.", "NTA but, dude, come on.  You\u2019re dating someone who has to hide a significant part of themselves from so many people.  I get it, but unless you two elope and she cuts off all her relatives, this is going nowhere.", "NTA. \n\nInfo: Is she Hindu. I am and we usually don't \"celebrate\" events for 1 year after the passing of a close relative. Just curious :>\n\nAnd honestly I don't think she is really traditional esp if she is going to the club lol", "NTA because you said you weren\u2019t sure if she could come or not. Regardless this isn\u2019t sounding like a healthy relationship\u2026 especially if you\u2019ve broken up multiple times already. Just let it go", "NTA\n\nYou can hang out with your guy friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMake plans with friends & don't worry if she shows up to things or not.", "I fully understand that different cultures have different norms and values.  I also understand that when you love someone you will make allowances for that person that you wouldn't necessarily make for everyone.  But friend...\n\nSecrets and relationships that family don't know about rarely end well.  Her struggles between being with you and being (superficially) true to her family's traditional values may be getting to her.  She needs very much to figure out what she wants and be honest with everyone about what is going on.  I get the impression she is struggling.\n\nThat said, you responded to the invitation the way you should.  You can go, she is not sure.  I am not sure what she thought was better.  Sit at home like a bump and be miserable while she does something without you?  Be happy that she broke up with you.  You deserve better.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You need to be with someone who\u2019ll prioritize you\u2026not her family", "NTA.  She sounds like a PITA.", "NTA..  and dude, you the side piece.. wake up.", "She is not Hindu, she is from a European country, but they have similar levels of \"strict\" to our culture. I am from a South Asian culture, so I understand their traditions and the whole \"not dating\" lol. \n\nAlso, to everyone commenting about her family situation and the future of our relationship: \n\nI did not think it was relevant to the situation, but since many are commenting about this, her not telling her family is a mutual understanding. She offered to introduce me to her parents in the past, but I refused. I am saving for a house and was planning to propose and meet her family this coming year, but only after purchasing a home. So we are both fine with \"hiding it\" from her family for now. We did have a long term plan for this.", "Hopefully it works out for you guys! Yall definitely  need more communication..."]}
