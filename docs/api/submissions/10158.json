We have known each other since freshman year of high school. Looking back, there\u2019s always been a lot of red flags that I didn\u2019t want to see. Everything was always about what he wanted, and never about me. I let him pull me into his gravity, and I just orbited him. For context, Dick is rich and I am not. But I never thought that mattered, not to him. He insisted it didn\u2019t matter, and I took him at his word. My mother had been sick for several months, declining in health, and two weeks ago she died. My wedding is a month away. I asked Dick about postponing the wedding, because I am still very vulnerable about my mother being gone, and he freaked out. He talked about the rumors that it would spread and how bad it would look. We got into an argument, he called me some unkind names, and he stormed off for a smoke. Every fight we have ever had has ended the same way; I apologize for whatever made him mad, he kisses me, we go back to normal, rinse and repeat. I realized I couldn\u2019t do this anymore, living to appease others, so I took off my ring and told him I would be staying with my father for three days, and I wanted him gone when I came back. I own our house, my father built it himself as a wedding gift. Dick started to panic, telling me we could work it out, but I refused to talk to him. It\u2019s been a week and I feel so numb about all of this.

You ended a relationship that wasn't working.", "NTA, if he can't show you empathy when you're grieving your mother, he was never going to. This was a hard choice,  but the best choice. You deserve to be with someone who cares about your feelings and who tries to see your side even when he disagrees.\n\nAlso, I'm so sorry for your loss.", "NTA, better to cancel a wedding than file for divorce.", "You stood up for You before it was too late. Go You!!\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nFirst let me say I am sorry for your loss. I lost my dad days before my 18th birthday so I know what you are going through. It will get better, but it takes time.\n\nYou finally saw all the red flags and decided to do what needed to be done. It would only get worse after the wedding.\n\nThe fact that he couldn\u2019t support you at your most vulnerable moment says a lot about him and how he feels about you. \n\nIt will be difficult, but please, do not go back with him. You deserve someone that will treat you with love, respect and consideration for your feelings. Stay strong.", "NTA, good for you for getting out early, before your finances were legally tied together.", "NTA \n\nYou foresaw your own future and it wasn't want you wanted.    \n\nSmart move to cancel the wedding.\n\nSo sorry for your loss.   I know it's very hard to lose you mom.", "NTA!!! Cancelling a wedding will be much less stressful than getting a divorce. Of course you are numb with the loss of your mother. My condolences for your loss. You are making the right decision. \n\nTake your time to be with your dad and mourn the loss of your mom. You are very young and will meet a wonderful man someday who will be the husband that you deserve.", "NTA at all. I'm sorry you're going through this. I just lost my mom recently so my heart truly goes out to you. Unfortunately, difficult times reveal people's true character. Be grateful you go to see it before you were married to Dick the AH.", "NTA, \nYour mum just died for starters of course having a wedding with her not there is going to be hard. \nHe sounds like someone who doesn't take accountability for his wrong doings and makes them all seem like your fault (the whole getting pissed, storming off and waiting for you to apologise??) \nUse just going back to things being normal seems all well and good but at the end of the day use never sorted the problem just brushed it off, so the problem is still there not being delt with. \nHe gass lit you to make you feel bad for having emotions about a wedding without your mother, that's a dick move on his part and he was only worried about himself, again dick move.", "NTA and you did the right thing. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. This will be a difficult time for you, but please be strong. You deserve better. \u2665\ufe0f", "NTA", "One : my condolences about your mother, I'm sending you Internet hugs. \n\nYou don't know that yet, but you're incredibly lucky : you realized that your would-be life partner is (1) selfish and (2) incredibly dumb at a very young age, before anything unfixable happened. I'm happy that you realized that you had to walk away and that you have the means to do so unscathed. \n\n(1)a) Your mother died, but your ex-fianc\u00e9 refused to be any support to you;\n\n(1)b) Your ex-fianc\u00e9 made your mourning about him;\n\n(1)c) Your ex-fianc\u00e9 somehow reversed the situation to make it seem like you wronged him, in order to manipulate you into doing what he wanted;\n\n(1)d) Your fianc\u00e9 is so selfish that he assumes that other people are too, which led to him believing that ...\n\n(2) ...other people would also think that postponing the wedding is about him and not about you mourning your mother. Which is not how normal, emotionally healthy, empathetic people think.\n\n\nI seriously dislike the expression \"blessing in disguise\", because it reeks of \"everything happens for a reason\" (which irks me), but you saw his true colors as the best moment (now, and not down the line). \n\nAll the NTAs. Also, love the fake name you chose for him in this post.", "NTA babe. You're young and seem like you see your worth. Glad you have a beautiful house that's yours. Enjoy it and take the time to heal. Glad you saw the red flags in time.", "NTA. I'm sorry for your loss.  You were in a relationship with him from such a young age, you have never had a chance to truly learn who you as an individual. Take the time to do that now.", "NTA. I'm sorry about your mum. \n\nI wouldn't have left the house, though. Make him leave.", "NTA Don't let him weasel back into your life", "NTA. How can a wedding be joyful with such grief? A postponement of at least a year was in order. When someone so significant passes, life changes. Until you are at peace with her passing (and you will be) getting married should be unthinkable. Becoming a person with no mother is to take on a new reality. Becoming married is another new reality. One new reality at a time is fair enough. It's not like you left him at the altar.", "NTA. I hope your house is as you left it when you next see it. Very sorry for the loss of your mother.", "NTA - the vow is in sickness and health. I feel this includes in grief as well. If he can\u2019t honor your mom by at least honoring your wishes, is this the man you want to be the father to your children? Dismissive? You made the right choice.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this. You have my condolences on the loss of your mother.\n\nAs for your ex...well, you chose an appropriate alias for him. You are better off without him. He seems very self-centered and insensitive to your needs. \n\nSince you own the house, I advise you to change the locks on the doors in case Dick kept a copy of the key.", "NTA. I'm so sorry about your mom.", "NTA. I'm sorry for your loss! Please, please, please do not take this man back! I'm sure he's going to do and say ANYTHING to try and win you back. He'll promise to change his ways, and he might do just that. But it will be short lived. He'd go back to normal pretty quickly and then you'll just be back at square one. It hurts, I know, I've been there! But you need to do what's best for you, and that's to not be with an abusive a-hole.", "NTA op. Good for you in throwing out the man before you married him. In times of grief he's concerned about what others think. This will be a good life lesson for him", "Well, if you ask AI, it says youre NTA \n\n\u201cBased on the information provided, it seems like the person in this situation is not the asshole for canceling the wedding. The ex-fianc\u00e9 appears to have shown little regard for the individual's feelings, particularly in the aftermath of the death of her mother. The ex-fianc\u00e9's reaction to the suggestion of postponing the wedding seems selfish and insensitive, especially given the circumstances. Additionally, it is concerning that the individual felt like every argument ended with her apologizing, and that she had to live to appease others. Overall, it seems like canceling the wedding and taking time for herself was a necessary step for the individual's well-being and self-respect.\u201d", "NTA. You were in a toxic, potentially abusive, relationship. You got out. Be safe, stay strong. Do not let this man back into your life. Good for you for finally realizing this, I'm so sorry that it took this tragedy for it to happen and I'm sorry for your loss. You are going to be better off without him. Part of what you are feeling is mourning for your mother, the loss of this AH is not going to hurt you in the long run.", "As a young woman who recently lost their mom\u2026 you\u2019re grieving so much more than just her.

I lost mine 14 years ago and it still hurts as if it was yesterday. OP stay strong, it's okay to cry and grieve. If life keeps throwing challenges at you keep swinging. It's not going to be easy. Live for your mom as if she is still here. She would want you to be happy. Cherish every memory of her. Every year for my late father's birthday I celebrate his life. It helps me get through it. As for your ex, he don't deserve you. He's being manipulative and I wouldn't want to spend my life with someone like that. You deserve to be happy."]}
