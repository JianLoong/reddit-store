Our hotel had a beach, a pool, and an ice cream shop, and even that was wearing thin after a week.\n3.

The bridal couple should be bending over backwards to come up with solutions.\n\nAnd sometimes, with the best will in the world, there are no solutions. It's no one's fault.

That way, you could attend the events while leaving your child in care only for a few hours at a time, and you could pop in and out to check on your child if that helps reassure you.\n\nIf they're not prepared to do something like that... well, then, I'd have no trouble saying \"I'm sorry.

It doesn\u2019t seem like your wife\u2019s family is upset you might not go so I hesitate to call them AHs. You are also NTA because you simply can\u2019t afford to both go and arrange child care.", "NTA, but it\u2019ll not all or nothing. You could fly out just for a ceremony or a day or two of events. Your wife could also go just by herself since it\u2019s her brother. There are compromises. It\u2019s ok not to go though.", "NTA\nIt's a wedding invitation not a wedding demand. And I say this as someone who was the bride in a very similar wedding (one Aussie, one Brit, UK wedding) and I had to accept that a lot of friends and family couldn't make that journey.\n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would be thanking the couple for the invite but declining. That's too far for me to go just for a week as an adult, let alone with a bub in tow.", "I\u2019d go to Greece (all 3 of you) let your spouse attend the wedding alone as well as maybe one or two other wedding-related events, and the rest of the time, the three of you have a wonderful time NOT doing wedding-related things together in Greece. Awesome vacation with LIMITED wedding week participation, no babysitter needed, family can\u2019t complain because you made an effort and followed their \u201cno kids\u201d rule.", "NTA.  A highly scheduled long trip with a baby will just be exhausting even in a beautiful setting. IMO.", "NTA maybe they thought your family would step up?", "NTA mate\n\n\"Sorry there is no way we can leave our baby for over a week back in Australia, congratulations on your wedding, but we can't attend\".", "NAH. They don\u2019t want kids at the wedding. I\u2019m fairly certain they HAVE thought about it and this is their decision. You do what you feel is best. I do want to say it\u2019s not \u201cinsane\u201d to bring a sitter with you to watch the baby for wedding events, breakfast included. If you want to attend, this is a great compromise. Attend the events you want, sitter watching the baby, and skip the ones you don\u2019t. Just make sure to clearly communicate the events your skipping just in case they have to pay per head.", "NTA as long as you don\u2019t push to have the child included and just inform them as much as you would love to be there it\u2019s not possible.\n\nPushing them to include the child in events would be an asshole move.", "My cousin got married in Jamaica, so only 9 people showed up to her wedding\u2014her immediate family and his, and their Best Man/MOH.", "Right most people can\u2019t/won\u2019t leave their kids for a few days for someone else\u2019s event", "Finally someone else notices that! I think OP is trying to trick this thread into giving them \"permission\" into crashing the wedding with a baby. Beautiful extended vacation in Greece - or staying home? And OP wants to chose the beautiful vacation and wants both parents and baby to attend the ceremony. OP never once mentioned the option of staying home and not going to Greece - only other commenters in this thread assumed that was the conclusion.", "Personal I wouldn\u2019t leave my child with stranger in a foreign country. Especially when my baby cant tell me if somethings happens. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t ask for exception. I would just stated that you guys cant make it due to childcare options.", "This is where we\u2019re not sure if we are being too precious. Should we just be \u201cget over it\u201d and leave him in a childcare overnight for the ceremony? He would probably be fine\u2026 and we could splinter off and do our own holiday perhaps? But then\u2026 it\u2019s a lot of expense and effort just for one event.", "I mean, is a wedding week a thing though? I understand couples having a wedding day which should be 100% what they want but a whole week sounds a little much especially if the guests are forking out $$$ to get there", "Yeah, a destination wedding means fewer people will attend for ALL SORTS of reasons, not just childcare.", "Would you feel comfortable leaving your young toddler overnight in a foreign country with a stranger? I sure as hell wouldn't, but to each their own, I guess...", "You really want to take an 18mth old on the long flights required to get there and just be there for a week?", "Mate, if I was you I would go to the wedding in Greece as a family of 3.  Get hotel nanny for the ceremony and then I\u2019d skip the reception and have room service whilst the wife does the reception (it\u2019s her brother).  Then I\u2019d F off and do our own family holiday.  (That is, skip the \u201cbreakfasts\u201d and any other events.  Go to the church ceremony as a couple only and the wife to the reception, skip any other events and enjoy Greece as a family).\n\nTicks the box you were at the wedding and then you get your own family holiday. \n\nWith that said, I\u2019d get your sister to chat to your brother about that being your plans.  Communication is key - letting folks know how you plan to roll given the no kids.\n\n(Edit to add, that\u2019s if this is easy to swing financially - if it\u2019s all a bit much and you don\u2019t feel like it will be a value for money holiday / good use of resources then just don\u2019t go, but again wife needs to speak to brother before rsvp\u2019ing no).", "You're not being 'too precious.\" I don't have kids but I wouldn't feel comfortable leaving my kid with someone I don't know if they can't speak at that age. \n\nI also vote NAH. You're not an AH for not making it and they're not AHs for making the festivities child free. I'm sure they'll understand you can't make it.", "Why do you even feel that you have to consider that option? \n\nYou would be taking your 1 1/2 year old on a very long plane ride. How will he deal with that? Will he need time to recuperate once you get to your destination? Will he be more clingy with you and your partner? Will he have separation anxiety since he\u2019s in a strange place? How does he deal with being with strangers now? His sleep pattern will be messed up, and then you\u2019d be expected to leave your very young child with complete strangers?\n\nAnd please tell me that you will be purchasing an airline seat for him and not holding him on your lap for that long of a journey. \n\nWhat if your wife just goes alone, and you stay home with the baby? Or better yet, send your regrets that you won\u2019t be there due to the length of the journey and refusal to be separated from your child for a large chunk of your family\u2019s vacation.", "A 20+ hour flight with a toddler is nuts!"]}
