After that, I lost it on her and told her to NEVER comment on my appearance ever again and that I couldn't believe she'd make a disparaging remark about my appearance when I was bald and going through one of the hardest times of my life. She still defended the comment and acted like I over reacted and only had the reaction I did because cancer had made me overly sensitive. \n\nAfter that, when shes wanted to criticize me, she'll  just look me up and down and make a face at me and say \"well you have made it clear you don't want me commenting on your appearance\" (making clear she had something disparaging to say about it). I've just rolled my eyes and not acknowledged the comment, but yea it toxic af. \n\nThe comments ARE disrespectful and fucked up and I'm sorry you deal with the same thing.

Also, my kids adore her and she's good with them so I deal with a lot of her shit because of that. I've genuinely stopped letting her opinion bother me 90% of the time. It helps when I remember it comes from a place of insecurity. She's always placed a lot of importance on looks (probably because she grew up poor and in an abusive household with few prospects and very little else to rely on), but in her 20s, she was a very conventionally beautiful woman and I think that as she aged, she felt like she was losing all her capital and she resented me for it.", "Yes!", "I pity your mother and this is why I always tell parents to never drum the idea into their children's heads that looks are capital and see the importance of nurturing their children's intellect, skills and good behaviour as these are the things they will carry for life in order to become productive members of society. I also remind parents that looks are not always everything too"]}
