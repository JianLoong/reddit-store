It\u2019s okay to ask, of course. But she doesn\u2019t want to. Completely fine as well.", "YTA- I\u2019m imagining this other girl parking her car and getting into her other ride wondering why some crazy lady was giving her the ugliest, contentious scowl. That *semi-dirty look* could very well have been in response to whatever you were subconsciously sending her way.", "YTA, it\u2019s not a reserved spot", "YTA. But you arent the asshole because you asked, or because she got offended. Its fine to ask someone, \"even a woman\", to park elsewhere if you have good reason-if its a single day emergency, if its your personal parking space, if you are moving something heavy, if you need quick accsess to your car for some reason, if theres absolutely no other space nearby-many many more even! But unless its your space or a space allocated to the building and its residents, its an asshole move to ask for it to make your life easier when you dont know whether or not it makes her life easier. Id say it would less assholish if it was a street parking spot infront of an individual house in a smaller neighberhood or something and or there were no other spots whithin easy walking distance for you, but it certainly doesnt sound like that.\n\nIf you want a personal parking space to be guaranteed, you need to find somewhere that incldues one in the rent or rent one seperately. If you want a public parking space, you can have it by leaving your car there. \n\nYou dont know this woman or her life, even if she doesnt live nearby she might work nearby or have family or be disabled or any of a host of things that make parking there a priority for her, and even if she doesnt well, its a public parking space. Its like going up to someone and asking them not to buy the last donut at a shop because you want it.\n\nThats like is a Seinfield episode.", "YTA, it's a public street without reserved parking.  While I understand you want to use it for convenience, it's not your spot alone.", "NTA\n\nYou can ask. She can say no. She seems to be going overboard to make your life difficult for asking.", "YTA - it\u2019s a public street, you dont own it.", "YTA. It\u2019s not your spot.", "everyone is saying street parking but your post says parking lot.. is the parking exclusive to people living in your building? if yes, NTA. if no, softly YTA for saying something because she has the right to be there but it is odd behaviour on her end", "YTA it\u2019s none of your business where she lives or why she is parking there.", "Yta", "Sadly, street parking is public and anyone can park there at any time for any reason if there are no restrictions.  It sounds as if this other driver might be commuting in from somewhere else if she's there every day. If you have your own parking lot which is safe to use in daylight at least, then YTA for asking her to move.", "I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say you\u2019re an AH, but neither is she, and you\u2019re in the wrong\n\nShe can park anywhere she\u2019s legally allowed to.", "ESH. She\u2019s doing that at this point to be petty because you asked her to do something she doesn\u2019t have to do.  Not your place to ask her to convenience you, although no  harm in asking I guess. At this point, enjoy the walk until she gets tired of it. Or steal her car and park it up a tree. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "YTA, it\u2019s public\u2026you don\u2019t own it so suck it up", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
