But it doesn't matter if his cousin ends up using it or not - the kids would be, what, second cousins, and have different last names anyway? Who cares. One of his siblings could want to use the same name and I still wouldn't care.", "My sister in law (coincidentally, she has the same first name as me), named her son with the same first name as my husband, her brother. She named him after his paternal grandfather, knowing when we got around to having kids, we'd likely also be using that first name in the event we had a son. Spoiler: we have 3 sons now, and yes, the eldest does share that first name. But it's a super common first name, and the kids have different middle and last names. We just use first and middle in conversations with family or at family events.\n\nOn the other side of the family, my sister has 2 boys, and the eldest has a name that was briefly on my list of potential names. But as she had a child first, I never told her there were any names off limits. By the time I had kids, my tastes had changed, and it was no longer on our short list for names.", "I told my brother before either of us had kids that if I have a son I would like to name him after our dad (its a very common name). He had two sons before I started having kids and used it for a middle name for one of them. If he had used it as a first I would have been like, aw bummer, he got there first, and moved on. I wouldn't have even mentioned it. You can make the request but you need to accept that its not up to you. When I had my son I was lucky that my husband liked the name, because I couldn't NOT use it after asking. \n\nBut these people aren't even family and there are no sentimental attachments to any of them so wtf.", "They sound like a special brand of crazy. I\u2019d never, ever consider handing my friends a list of names they couldn\u2019t use.. INCLUDING family names.

She had one single pregnancy, the rest were multiples.", "Thank you for putting that back in my head. For years I worried about poor Valentina, living in Russia and having to dress 69 children in snowsuits, mitts, and hats before they went out the door. Then as soon as they did, one kid would have to pee.\n\nLife would have been much easier for Valentina had she lived in a tropical country where she could throw them naked out the back door and let them run around without diapers.", "Surviving 27 births of multiples back then is amazing!

Its super confusing because they both have the same last initial, so we have to say their whole name or say \"X's Teddy\" or \"Y's Teddy\" to differentiate. Its only a problem for us, since the two sides don't interact much.", "Most of the men in my family go by a first and middle name in family settings because so many share one of three first names. It's literally never been a problem. \n\nMy mom and aunt (sisters) married men with the same name. Family used a last initial to differentiate my dad from my uncle in conversation. \n\nMy brother in law was briefly married to a woman who shares my first and middle name - so we laughed about it and went by \"Panic 1\" (me bc I was there first) and \"Panic 2\".\n\nAnd this is all family. Within my friend group, there are plenty of shared names between all the spouses and kids. \n\nHow is this such a big deal?", "I actually had just read about Valentina Vassilyve and it's speculated she hyper-ovulated each month. She was a peasant in czarist Russia, probably not much to do during the long winter nights except make babies.", "At that point you don't even name them, just give them numbers.\n\nI'm an only child and still got the \"cats name dogs name cat2s name cat3s name Guinea pigs name stop laughing dammit op!\"\n\nGetting the right name would take a loooong time", "Considering this was the 18th century, I wonder how many of the 69 survived infancy.
