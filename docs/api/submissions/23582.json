There is absolutely nothing wrong with gaining weight, but your friend seems to struggle with it, given that she's seeking some sort of reassurance in always asking if she \"looks fat\".

If she's gained as much weight as you've described, then there isn't any point in lying to her about it.

Let me tell you something, I gained about 20-30 lbs in the last few years. For the last 8 months I've been trying everything reasonable (aka working out, eating balanced meals, no crash dieting) to lose weight. I haven't lost a pound. In fact, I'm pretty sure I gained weight. I work out, hard (cardio, strength training, HIIT, dance), at least 3-4 times a week, unless I am traveling or have an injury. I don't really binge eat, but I also allow myself desserts and some junk food every once in a while as a treat.  I really try to watch what I eat while not starving myself. I have never hated my body more in my entire life. I know intellectually I'm not bad looking and not overweight, but I liked my old body and I hate this one, and I hate that it doesn't respond to anything I do. I don't ask people if I've gained weight, I know I have. It's a part of getting to my age too, and I probably will need to hire a professional trainer/nutritionist and consult a doctor as to why I cannot lose a single fucking pound unless I just stop eating altogether (yep, this is the only time I've lost weight, during periods of extreme depression where I would not want to eat for days at a time). Like I said, I don't ask my friends if I've gained weight, but I do mention that I am frustrated with my weight, that I am trying to lose weight, and that I'm struggling, and what I want to hear from my friends is stuff like:  \n\\- that sounds really frustrating, I'm sorry it's been so difficult  \n\\- you still look great even though you look different!  \n\\- you should be proud of yourself for your dedication to working out and getting stronger and fit  \n\\- I understand you're not feeling good about how you look right now, but I think your (legs, arms, hair, style) looks amazing!   \n\n\nWhat I really don't want to hear are things like:  \n\\- why do you feel like you need to lose weight?  \n\\- maybe there are more bad habits you can cut out  \n\\- just focus on getting stronger and be happy for all the things your body can do for you  \n\\- you should work on being happy with who you are\n\nNot that those things aren't true, they just aren't helpful for me to hear. Unless you have reason to believe your friend is suffering from an exercise or eating disorder, let them go through what they need to go through. It's really hard.

Your body isn\u2019t going to be storing anything (because it doesn\u2019t want to die) if it isn\u2019t getting enough external calories to run itself.", "No no I totally get it! We all do that, it\u2019s how our brains work unless (often even if) we challenge those thoughts :)", "I\u2019m only speculating at this point but dancing and fitness classes is relatively meaningless to me. You can do a few twirls and wave your arms about and that\u2019s dancing. A gentle fitness class is great too but you can do those even if you have some physical/health struggles. And, if the friend is self-reporting her fitness activities, it\u2019s likely that she is over exaggerating them (studies show we generally overestimate how active we are and underestimate how much we eat - of course the reverse is frequently true with people who are underweight.)\n\nAnd near-total loss of functional mobility is one of the last things to happen.  They can keep up with their activities (perhaps to a lesser extent) for a long time but eventually hit a wall if they don\u2019t take steps to enhance their mobility and endurance and overall health. Which you can do at a larger size but only to a certain extent, and the weight is likely to catch up with you eventually even if you do maintain a level of fitness. \n\nAll that being said, I don\u2019t think it matters - people can have different priorities, you know? Most people aren\u2019t as healthy as they could be. I just really really struggle with this social coddling surrounding weight. It started out as a needed pushback against the mistreatment people can suffer but in some spaces the pendulum has swung too far.", "I said fat because that\u2019s what I was - fat. But it wasn\u2019t \u2018fat\u2019 it just looked like obesity, it was system swelling in every gland in the body, but no one knew that at the time so everyone just thought I was fat. I dunno why you\u2019re arguing with me about my own medical history and diagnosis\n\nEdit to help you understand: have you ever seen anyone who\u2019s got mumps and their entire neck and jaw swells up? Imagine that, but not painful and not quite as dramatic, and imagine that it\u2019s every gland in the body, so that was basically what I looked like. But of course no one had connected the dots (the steroid dose I was on wouldn\u2019t have caused that level of swelling IF the pituitary hadn\u2019t also screwed up at the same time), so everyone, including me, thought I was just obese until i fainted basically from starving myself in school and got taken to hospital where they ran tests and went \u2018oh shit\u2026\u2019", "NTA but you can set boundaries around the q. \"I don't feel comfortable commenting on anybody's body. Please stop asking me\"", "So I\u2019ve gained a lot of weight recently. I have a VERY honest boyfriend. I have asked him similar questions. He answers in the same way you do, because he knows how self critical I am on myself based on my weight/size and he doesn\u2019t want to hurt my feelings. \n\nI really just wanted someone to make me feel better about an issue I was fully aware of. It was trying to fix my bruised ego. It doesn\u2019t help me, not really. \n\nWhat you should do, the next time she asks, is to very gently ask her why she asks. She may tell you that she has gained some weight. Tell her if she\u2019s really concerned, there are resources that could help her. She may say she was just wondering, in which case just let it go. \n\nBut do not discuss her eating habits unless she asks. She doesn\u2019t have a healthy relationship with food, and pointing it out could have her having a different unhealthy relationship with food (anorexia/bulimia).", "\u201cHave I gained weight?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo idea, what does the scale say?\u201d\n\nProblem solved lmao", "Why not flip it around a little? When she asks about the weight just say she always looks beautiful to you\u2026but maybe throw in that you\u2019ve noticed when you\u2019re watching a movie or whatever it seems like her breathing  is heavier than before and that\u2019s concerning you and she might consider having her doctor look into that? Her doctor can take it from there to address anything unhealthy that may be going on. Including weight.", "NAH. Gaining weight is difficult and makes people insecure. She is putting you in a tough position but she is asking as a friend. I definitely would not comment on her eating habits though, it's not anyone else's business to try to \"help\" fat people.", "I may get downvoted but what I am gathering from all of your comments is that this girl needs you to tell her the truth.\nHow close are you two? Like bffs? It feels like she is desperately trying to get a truthful statement from someone. My guess is that no one has told her that yes, she has gotten obviously larger, and no, it doesn\u2019t affect their love for her. She\u2019s even setting you up, saying she eats like a bird, or that people wish they looked like her. \nLet\u2019s assume she knows she has gained weight. Why on earth would she think her friend wouldn\u2019t notice? Please tell her something like, \u201cI do realize that you have gained weight over the years and I also still love you and think you\u2019re pretty.\u201d", "NTA. You care about her feelings. You're being a good friend.", "I think I\u2019d be more blunt: \u201cLook, you know how your clothes fit, you know what the scale says. What are you actually asking me here?\u201d\n\nNTA.", "She's wanting an enabler to say it's okay for her to keep eating tons of junk food.  She is a heart attack waiting to happen if she keeps up.  I don't know if it's your place or not but she needs help, and now.  NTAH.", "This is the way.", "This is a good take. Thank you!", "You're gaining weight because you're eating surplus calories.  I'd avoid the \"junk food and desserts\" you mention here and start counting calories. This isn't really as mysterious as you're trying to make it out to be.", "When I eat junk food and dessert, I track those calories too and I still maintain a deficit. I'm not going to never allow myself a piece of chocolate. I routinely burn around 2500 total calories a day, and usually eat only about 1600 calories. I don't know what you think \"having a dessert\" means, but I assure you I'm not scarfing down an entire pie. I'm having like one or two cookies or some homemade popcorn with olive oil. It's calories in, calories out right? That's the theory. So by your logic if I eat an entire cake but keep under my deficit, that should do the trick.", "Gotcha", "You aren't gaining weight on a calorie deficit. You are either overestimating how many calories you're burning or underestimating the amount of calories you're consuming. Or both.", "NTA.  There is something you are overlooking here.  What someone eats when they go out with others does not always reflect how they eat alone.  I go out with others and it\u2019s a treat.  I will get things I would not normally.  So, best not to make assumptions.  She knows she has put on weight.  I think you have found the best option, compliment her clothing.", "NTA but I do think you should tell her the truth. Iono how close your relationship is. But I can always tell me friends something even if it\u2019s a painful truth", "\"Do these pants make my ass look fat?\"\n\n\"No hun, it's not the pants.\"", "NTA but next time maybe try something like \u201cyou look great but I\u2019ve noticed you ask me that a lot. Have you considered going to therapy to help your relationship with your body?\u201d", "To be fair, some people really can't tell.  I gained like 100lbs and only one pants size.  I really hadn't realized how much weight I gained until I got on the scale (I had avoided weighing myself due to recovering from an eating disorder).   Then I lost 75lbs and only went down 1/2 a pant size (edit: I actually went and bought another scale because I didn't believe I had lost all that weight.  Even after the second scale I still didn't really believe it until I went to the doctor).  Even other people couldn't tell I lost weight.\n\nAll that being said, when I gained and lost all that weight I was still really overweight at both points so it's not like I didn't know I was fat, just didn't realize I weighed 400lbs.", "I think measuring yourself can be really eye-opening vs weighing in too. I\u2019ve been weighing myself regularly and have been operating on a level of \u201cgood lord, I need to drop many lbs!\u201d but at the same time feeling like \u201cit\u2019s okay, the lbs will come off slowly...\u201d  \n\nYesterday, I measured myself and really looked at myself in the mirror. To say my mindset has changed would be an understatement. Like, I need to lose weight *now*. I need to up my exercise by about 3x and really look at my diet.

I might frame it as in, maybe you have lost some muscle or are retaining water for health reasons, did you ask your doctor? It could be something like hypothyroidism or other health factors. Maybe encourage her to see her doctor. If she is overweight the doctor will tell her.", "Not really these days. Words like \u201cfat phobic\u201d get thrown around like crazy.   \nI\u2019m all for progressive ideas on \u201cnormalcy\u201d but 100 lbs overweight is NOT healthy.", "I think there's a social media vacuum of thought like that. You'd be surprised by how many people in the real world don't agree with those ideas."]}
