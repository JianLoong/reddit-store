{"id": 16225, "submission_id": "135s8xx", "title": "AITA for not inviting my dad's wife to the wedding?", "selftext": "I (24F) got engaged last May to my fianc\u00e9 (24M). I am very excited about it but when it came down to planning, I knew that my parents would be a tough situation. My parents separated when I was 16 and didn't get officially divorced until 2020. My dad re-married in 2021. I will refer to his wife as Sharon. \n\nDuring the initial separation, my sisters and I stayed with our mom. She was going through such a hard time. My dad, in the beginning, attempted to make an effort with my sisters and me but it was very obvious that he was eager to start his new family. He eventually became a distant father. Only really talking to us around holidays, taking Sharon and her kids on trips, and bonding with them. I missed my dad but he seemed to have already moved on from us and he was never a good person to communicate with. I still attempted to have some sort of relationship, even if it was at arm's length. I invited him to my high school and college graduation which he attended both without Sharon. \n\nWhen Sharon and my dad got engaged, none of us were happy about it but it was what he wanted. We went to the wedding. All three of us were very emotional about it which family on my dad's side could tell and tried to comfort us. I have never been mean to Sharon. I have always just sort of tolerated her. We never formed any kind of bond and I only ever saw her if I was visiting my dad which already was once in a while. The same applies for my sisters. \n\nSo, now being engaged, I've taken everything in. I decided I wanted my dad at my wedding but just as my dad. He wouldn't get a plus one or anything of the sort. To make things fair, I set the same rules for my mom. This past weekend, I went to talk to him and Sharon. My fianc\u00e9 was with me when I told them. I said that I meant no disrespect but I had to also think of my mom and that this would be easier. I also made it a point to tell him that my mom isn't allowed to bring anyone either. If Sharon wanted to celebrate our wedding, we could always also do dinner another time. I thought letting them know in advance (since the wedding isn't until fall 2024) he would, hopefully, take it well and still want to show up. I was emotional and afterward, he did hug me and told me that he would let me know their decision. I left feeling better, but things changed.\n\nOn our way home, he called me. He asked if this was my decision which I said yes to. Then he told me that we could do dinner another time and essentially his answer was no. I was upset so we just said our goodbyes and that was that.\n\nEDIT:\nSome asked why I don\u2019t want Sharon there and I commented my explanation. Another suggested I add it here.\n\nShe was part of the reason my father left. In no way do I consider my mother the better parent in everything, but she wanted to work and try. Sharon was my father's co-worker. When he left, he immediately moved in with her. And if I am honest, my sisters and I have never seen her as a stepmother but more as our dad's girlfriend/wife. There's just no relationship there. I will admit, I never fully tried but I was young when I was navigating everything and I had no idea how to handle it. There was also no effort on her end. That has led to where I am today in my relationship with her and my father.", "created_utc": 1683043603, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/135s8xx/aita_for_not_inviting_my_dads_wife_to_the_wedding/", "score": 2883, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Both should be able to be cordial in a public setting and let's be real, Sharon isn't going anywhere. She'll be around for holidays, birthdays, celebrations for children if that's something you choose. It's not completely realistic to establish a baseline where your Dad's partner is not permitted at big family moments.\n\n*However*, it does sound like your relationship with your Dad has been strained since the separation and that you two have never found your way fully back together, nor does it sound like you and Sharon found some shared ground, so it makes sense why you may not want her there.", "NAH.

I understand you say that she was part of the reason that he left, but I feel like you never really know what goes on inside someone's marriage, maybe they were unhappy for a long time? Either way, it's been 8 years. Clearly Sharon isn't going anywhere and  I don't see the point in still holding grudges. It doesn't seem realistic to expect your dad to go to big family events without his partner. You can ask her not to come, but don't be surprised if your dad says no to attending himself.", "N T A. I will say that you are by no means required to have a relationship with someone you don't want to . The fact is your dad did what most do in that situation and wanted to focus on the new family. Well, the issue with that is the previous family doesn't just go away. Add to that the possibility of how your dad and Sharon got together. Well, I would say you're justified in how you feel. You guys have no relationship with her and probably never will. People in your life should enhance it. Does Sharon or your dad, for that matter, do that?", "It is tough. I am a child of divorce. I am also a stepparent. It is never easy from the child\u2019s perspective and a side is always taken. But as you will see once you marry and your vows strengthen and life pushes and pulls and your marital bond is of the utmost importance in your life\u2026. You will see that that is the priority and what comes first. Your dad should stand by his wife. \n\nHowever, you have the right to not invite her to the wedding. But understand there are consequences to that and you will be very sad and one day regret your dad\u2019s absence. So be sure that you are prepared to own that consequence and not direct your regret and anger on your dad or his wife.  \n\nThankfully there is time to marinate. As an adult and soon to be wife, work hard on recognizing that every one of us is responsible for our own happiness. You should invite your mom and dad and allow them to bring their person. \n\nIt is not easy for anyone but this is life. These are your cards. Your mom should be (here in May 2023) showing motherly wisdom and grace and not allowing you to have to sacrifice your dad at YOUR wedding because of her own relationship issues. Your mom needs to move forward in her life\u2026 which is also not your responsibility. \n\nBig decision. Think it over more.", "NTa", "NTA, you wedding your guest list.  Your mom is not allowed a plus one either.  You need to point out to your dad that he walked out on his family for Sharon and her family.  While he ostracized you and your sister, he took Sharon and her kids on trips to bond with them. They did nothing for you to bond with Sharon.  She did not attend your milestones like graduation.  Yet she wants to be at the wedding (I am sure front and center).  Stick to your rules.  When you do get married have security there.  I would not put it past her just showing up expecting to be treated like the mother of the bride.", "YTA\n\nYou are asking him to come and support your marriage, and yet you don\u2019t respect his. Your relationship with him and her aside, it is a major breach of wedding etiquette which be rightfully interprets to be downright insulting. It doesn\u2019t sound like Sharon has even done anything wrong. You don\u2019t have to like her, but it\u2019s a bit shocking that you are taking your anger at your father out on her.\n\nEdit to add, he was apparently an absent father so why do you even want him there? Or is this weird manipulative bull crap you are doing is so that he will refuse to come and then you won\u2019t feel like the bad guy? It\u2019s time to grow up OP", "> he would, hopefully, take it well and still want to show up\n\nI laughed reading that. How would you react to you getting a wedding invite  but realizing your husband was specifically not invited? You would feel insulted and that your relationship was disrespected. I find it very difficult to believe that anyone could be so oblivious to the consequences their actions to not know how this would affect your dad. \n\nIt\u2019s your wedding, invite who you want to be there.  At the same time, actions have consequences.

There was plenty of reason to decline to invite your father, but none to snub his wife. You don't have a negative word to say about her, only that you're not close.

It seems like they divorce their kids too.\n\nYour dad left you, your siblings and your mother for Sharon. He neglected you while he was starting a new family with her. It's very normal for you to exclude Sharon from your wedding. You still have a soft spot for your dad after all he's done and if I were him, I would be glad I'm still invited to your wedding. It wouldn't hurt him to prioritize you just for one day. Sharon never had any kind of relationship with you. I don't think she would be happy to attend your wedding knowing she's only being tolerated.\n\nYou invited your dad and he said no.

It has been eight years since your parents separated, and not only is it unreasonable to expect your dad not to start a new relationship, it's incredibly rude to invite him with the caveat that he can't bring his wife. \n\nYou don't have to be besties with her, but it sounds like even before this you were at least unfriendly towards her. People can usually tell when you're being cold with them, whether you mean to show it or not, and if I were in her shoes I wouldn't be reading this as a one-off thing but the culmination of a bad relationship.\n\nThey're in the right to be offended, this was an asshole move. If you didn't want to insult her, you shouldn't have tried to finagle it so only your father\u2014*her husband\u2014*was there in the first place.", "YTA \n\nWhy on earth would Sharon want to have a dinner to celebrate a wedding she isn't invited to?

However, your dad is also allowed to say no. I guess you didn't expect it from him. Since it applies to both him and your mom he would be more inclined to agree.

I hope your Dad realizes that his selfishness is destroying his relationship with his daughter. If it comes up again, just tell your Dad that it is completely unreasonable of him to expect you to allow the person that helped your Dad tear your family apart to attend your wedding isn\u2018t just unacceptable, it\u2019s selfish and hurtful to you.\n\nYour story is a lesson to all the cheaters out there, don\u2018t ever expect your kids to be OK with having the home wrecker being part of their lives.

I am very excited about it but when it came down to planning, I knew that my parents would be a tough situation. My parents separated when I was 16 and didn't get officially divorced until 2020. My dad re-married in 2021. I will refer to his wife as Sharon. \n\nDuring the initial separation, my sisters and I stayed with our mom. She was going through such a hard time. My dad, in the beginning, attempted to make an effort with my sisters and me but it was very obvious that he was eager to start his new family. He eventually became a distant father. Only really talking to us around holidays, taking Sharon and her kids on trips, and bonding with them. I missed my dad but he seemed to have already moved on from us and he was never a good person to communicate with. I still attempted to have some sort of relationship, even if it was at arm's length. I invited him to my high school and college graduation which he attended both without Sharon. \n\nWhen Sharon and my dad got engaged, none of us were happy about it but it was what he wanted. We went to the wedding. All three of us were very emotional about it which family on my dad's side could tell and tried to comfort us. I have never been mean to Sharon. I have always just sort of tolerated her. We never formed any kind of bond and I only ever saw her if I was visiting my dad which already was once in a while. The same applies for my sisters. \n\nSo, now being engaged, I've taken everything in. I decided I wanted my dad at my wedding but just as my dad. He wouldn't get a plus one or anything of the sort. To make things fair, I set the same rules for my mom. This past weekend, I went to talk to him and Sharon. My fianc\u00e9 was with me when I told them. I said that I meant no disrespect but I had to also think of my mom and that this would be easier. I also made it a point to tell him that my mom isn't allowed to bring anyone either. If Sharon wanted to celebrate our wedding, we could always also do dinner another time. I thought letting them know in advance (since the wedding isn't until fall 2024) he would, hopefully, take it well and still want to show up. I was emotional and afterward, he did hug me and told me that he would let me know their decision. I left feeling better, but things changed.\n\nOn our way home, he called me. He asked if this was my decision which I said yes to. Then he told me that we could do dinner another time and essentially his answer was no. I was upset so we just said our goodbyes and that was that.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I have a brother who was also a teenager at that time. They got divorced because, as my dad put it: he had found someone else he wanted to be with. Within three years he had married his AP and had two kids with her. My mum has stayed single, as I don't think she ever got over the rejection, and my brother and I are her whole life. My mum and dad's wife haven't met or seen each other since around the time of the divorce when they spoke together once. It is now over 12 years since the divorce.\n\nI didn't invite my dad's wife to my high school graduation, and didn't have a university graduation.

I had decided to invite my dad and my half-siblings, but that his wife wasn't invited.  \"Because of my mum\" is how I put it when I spoke to him. I was thinking of saving my mum the pain of having to be around and polite to dad's wife. Dad's wife did comment to me once that it was sad that not everyone got to join in the celebration, and I said something along the lines of yes it's sad but it's just the way it has to be.\n\nOn the day of the wedding my dad showed up by himself, without my half-siblings. Being the non-confrontational family that we are I never said to him that it bothered me he came alone, and he never offered an explanation as to why. \n\nI don't regret not inviting her as I know my mum would have had a terrible time, and thus I would have been stressed and sad. I do however regret not explaining better why, and also emphasizing that my half-siblings were invited and saying something afterwards.

In reality, after a divorce, the adults should spend a good bit of time single, working on themselves for the better, and focusing on the kids and all the changes they make on the kid's lives. I think he sounds pretty selfish.
