{"id": 16225, "submission_id": "135s8xx", "title": "AITA for not inviting my dad's wife to the wedding?", "selftext": "I (24F) got engaged last May to my fianc\u00e9 (24M). I am very excited about it but when it came down to planning, I knew that my parents would be a tough situation. My parents separated when I was 16 and didn't get officially divorced until 2020. My dad re-married in 2021. I will refer to his wife as Sharon. \n\nDuring the initial separation, my sisters and I stayed with our mom. She was going through such a hard time. My dad, in the beginning, attempted to make an effort with my sisters and me but it was very obvious that he was eager to start his new family. He eventually became a distant father. Only really talking to us around holidays, taking Sharon and her kids on trips, and bonding with them. I missed my dad but he seemed to have already moved on from us and he was never a good person to communicate with. I still attempted to have some sort of relationship, even if it was at arm's length. I invited him to my high school and college graduation which he attended both without Sharon. \n\nWhen Sharon and my dad got engaged, none of us were happy about it but it was what he wanted. We went to the wedding. All three of us were very emotional about it which family on my dad's side could tell and tried to comfort us. I have never been mean to Sharon. I have always just sort of tolerated her. We never formed any kind of bond and I only ever saw her if I was visiting my dad which already was once in a while. The same applies for my sisters. \n\nSo, now being engaged, I've taken everything in. I decided I wanted my dad at my wedding but just as my dad. He wouldn't get a plus one or anything of the sort. To make things fair, I set the same rules for my mom. This past weekend, I went to talk to him and Sharon. My fianc\u00e9 was with me when I told them. I said that I meant no disrespect but I had to also think of my mom and that this would be easier. I also made it a point to tell him that my mom isn't allowed to bring anyone either. If Sharon wanted to celebrate our wedding, we could always also do dinner another time. I thought letting them know in advance (since the wedding isn't until fall 2024) he would, hopefully, take it well and still want to show up. I was emotional and afterward, he did hug me and told me that he would let me know their decision. I left feeling better, but things changed.\n\nOn our way home, he called me. He asked if this was my decision which I said yes to. Then he told me that we could do dinner another time and essentially his answer was no. I was upset so we just said our goodbyes and that was that.\n\nEDIT:\nSome asked why I don\u2019t want Sharon there and I commented my explanation. Another suggested I add it here.\n\nShe was part of the reason my father left. In no way do I consider my mother the better parent in everything, but she wanted to work and try. Sharon was my father's co-worker. When he left, he immediately moved in with her. And if I am honest, my sisters and I have never seen her as a stepmother but more as our dad's girlfriend/wife. There's just no relationship there. I will admit, I never fully tried but I was young when I was navigating everything and I had no idea how to handle it. There was also no effort on her end. That has led to where I am today in my relationship with her and my father.", "created_utc": 1683043603, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/135s8xx/aita_for_not_inviting_my_dads_wife_to_the_wedding/", "score": 673, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Both should be able to be cordial in a public setting and let's be real, Sharon isn't going anywhere. She'll be around for holidays, birthdays, celebrations for children if that's something you choose. It's not completely realistic to establish a baseline where your Dad's partner is not permitted at big family moments.\n\n*However*, it does sound like your relationship with your Dad has been strained since the separation and that you two have never found your way fully back together, nor does it sound like you and Sharon found some shared ground, so it makes sense why you may not want her there.", "NAH.

I understand you say that she was part of the reason that he left, but I feel like you never really know what goes on inside someone's marriage, maybe they were unhappy for a long time? Either way, it's been 8 years. Clearly Sharon isn't going anywhere and  I don't see the point in still holding grudges. It doesn't seem realistic to expect your dad to go to big family events without his partner. You can ask her not to come, but don't be surprised if your dad says no to attending himself.", "N T A. I will say that you are by no means required to have a relationship with someone you don't want to . The fact is your dad did what most do in that situation and wanted to focus on the new family. Well, the issue with that is the previous family doesn't just go away. Add to that the possibility of how your dad and Sharon got together. Well, I would say you're justified in how you feel. You guys have no relationship with her and probably never will. People in your life should enhance it. Does Sharon or your dad, for that matter, do that?", "It is tough. I am a child of divorce. I am also a stepparent. It is never easy from the child\u2019s perspective and a side is always taken. But as you will see once you marry and your vows strengthen and life pushes and pulls and your marital bond is of the utmost importance in your life\u2026. You will see that that is the priority and what comes first. Your dad should stand by his wife. \n\nHowever, you have the right to not invite her to the wedding. But understand there are consequences to that and you will be very sad and one day regret your dad\u2019s absence. So be sure that you are prepared to own that consequence and not direct your regret and anger on your dad or his wife.  \n\nThankfully there is time to marinate. As an adult and soon to be wife, work hard on recognizing that every one of us is responsible for our own happiness. You should invite your mom and dad and allow them to bring their person. \n\nIt is not easy for anyone but this is life. These are your cards. Your mom should be (here in May 2023) showing motherly wisdom and grace and not allowing you to have to sacrifice your dad at YOUR wedding because of her own relationship issues. Your mom needs to move forward in her life\u2026 which is also not your responsibility. \n\nBig decision. Think it over more.", "NTa", "NTA, you wedding your guest list.  Your mom is not allowed a plus one either.  You need to point out to your dad that he walked out on his family for Sharon and her family.  While he ostracized you and your sister, he took Sharon and her kids on trips to bond with them. They did nothing for you to bond with Sharon.  She did not attend your milestones like graduation.  Yet she wants to be at the wedding (I am sure front and center).  Stick to your rules.  When you do get married have security there.  I would not put it past her just showing up expecting to be treated like the mother of the bride.", "YTA\n\nYou are asking him to come and support your marriage, and yet you don\u2019t respect his. Your relationship with him and her aside, it is a major breach of wedding etiquette which be rightfully interprets to be downright insulting. It doesn\u2019t sound like Sharon has even done anything wrong. You don\u2019t have to like her, but it\u2019s a bit shocking that you are taking your anger at your father out on her.\n\nEdit to add, he was apparently an absent father so why do you even want him there? Or is this weird manipulative bull crap you are doing is so that he will refuse to come and then you won\u2019t feel like the bad guy? It\u2019s time to grow up OP", "> he would, hopefully, take it well and still want to show up\n\nI laughed reading that. How would you react to you getting a wedding invite  but realizing your husband was specifically not invited? You would feel insulted and that your relationship was disrespected. I find it very difficult to believe that anyone could be so oblivious to the consequences their actions to not know how this would affect your dad. \n\nIt\u2019s your wedding, invite who you want to be there.  At the same time, actions have consequences.

There was plenty of reason to decline to invite your father, but none to snub his wife. You don't have a negative word to say about her, only that you're not close.

It seems like they divorce their kids too.\n\nYour dad left you, your siblings and your mother for Sharon. He neglected you while he was starting a new family with her. It's very normal for you to exclude Sharon from your wedding. You still have a soft spot for your dad after all he's done and if I were him, I would be glad I'm still invited to your wedding. It wouldn't hurt him to prioritize you just for one day. Sharon never had any kind of relationship with you. I don't think she would be happy to attend your wedding knowing she's only being tolerated.\n\nYou invited your dad and he said no.

It has been eight years since your parents separated, and not only is it unreasonable to expect your dad not to start a new relationship, it's incredibly rude to invite him with the caveat that he can't bring his wife. \n\nYou don't have to be besties with her, but it sounds like even before this you were at least unfriendly towards her. People can usually tell when you're being cold with them, whether you mean to show it or not, and if I were in her shoes I wouldn't be reading this as a one-off thing but the culmination of a bad relationship.\n\nThey're in the right to be offended, this was an asshole move. If you didn't want to insult her, you shouldn't have tried to finagle it so only your father\u2014*her husband\u2014*was there in the first place.", "YTA \n\nWhy on earth would Sharon want to have a dinner to celebrate a wedding she isn't invited to?

Tbh, given he's basically checked out as your father, I'm surprised you invited him to begin with.", "NAH you did everything with the outmost respect and I salute you for that. However, your dad is also allowed to say no. I guess you didn't expect it from him. Since it applies to both him and your mom he would be more inclined to agree.

I hope your Dad realizes that his selfishness is destroying his relationship with his daughter. If it comes up again, just tell your Dad that it is completely unreasonable of him to expect you to allow the person that helped your Dad tear your family apart to attend your wedding isn\u2018t just unacceptable, it\u2019s selfish and hurtful to you.\n\nYour story is a lesson to all the cheaters out there, don\u2018t ever expect your kids to be OK with having the home wrecker being part of their lives.

I am very excited about it but when it came down to planning, I knew that my parents would be a tough situation. My parents separated when I was 16 and didn't get officially divorced until 2020. My dad re-married in 2021. I will refer to his wife as Sharon. \n\nDuring the initial separation, my sisters and I stayed with our mom. She was going through such a hard time. My dad, in the beginning, attempted to make an effort with my sisters and me but it was very obvious that he was eager to start his new family. He eventually became a distant father. Only really talking to us around holidays, taking Sharon and her kids on trips, and bonding with them. I missed my dad but he seemed to have already moved on from us and he was never a good person to communicate with. I still attempted to have some sort of relationship, even if it was at arm's length. I invited him to my high school and college graduation which he attended both without Sharon. \n\nWhen Sharon and my dad got engaged, none of us were happy about it but it was what he wanted. We went to the wedding. All three of us were very emotional about it which family on my dad's side could tell and tried to comfort us. I have never been mean to Sharon. I have always just sort of tolerated her. We never formed any kind of bond and I only ever saw her if I was visiting my dad which already was once in a while. The same applies for my sisters. \n\nSo, now being engaged, I've taken everything in. I decided I wanted my dad at my wedding but just as my dad. He wouldn't get a plus one or anything of the sort. To make things fair, I set the same rules for my mom. This past weekend, I went to talk to him and Sharon. My fianc\u00e9 was with me when I told them. I said that I meant no disrespect but I had to also think of my mom and that this would be easier. I also made it a point to tell him that my mom isn't allowed to bring anyone either. If Sharon wanted to celebrate our wedding, we could always also do dinner another time. I thought letting them know in advance (since the wedding isn't until fall 2024) he would, hopefully, take it well and still want to show up. I was emotional and afterward, he did hug me and told me that he would let me know their decision. I left feeling better, but things changed.\n\nOn our way home, he called me. He asked if this was my decision which I said yes to. Then he told me that we could do dinner another time and essentially his answer was no. I was upset so we just said our goodbyes and that was that.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Invite him if you want, your choice. But this is just a silly option.", "ESH. But not intentionally. OP and sisters went to live with mom because mom had it tougher and probably other reasons too. Dad tried in the beginning but gradually slowed. OP sees this as dad became distant but maybe the new family wanted to be with him. Both sides have their own view of who pulled away and neglected each other. OP admits theres no relationship and she never tried. Just crummy all around. Dad needs to make more effort too.", "YTA. You're now splitting up *two* long-term couples at your wedding and acting surprised that your dad is upset that he can't bring his wife? Why would Sharon want to celebrate your marriage when she's being shunned from the wedding? Excluding her from the main event but giving her the \"opportunity\" to celebrate privately is super rude. I get you don't love her, but you're just making this rift even wider. \n\nI'd also be offended if I were your mom and my partner was not invited in some weird show of fairness where everyone seems to lose.", "YTA.\n\nIf you wanted your dad to attend your wedding, you would have extended an invitation to his wife. This was nothing but a ploy to make him pick you over his wife.

I honestly probably wouldn't have invited my father either.", "NAH in this situation. In fact this maybe almost shows growth on Dads side (disrespected OP's mom and wants to be better to his new wife). Sounds like history of assholery but not here. However, if OP wants dad involved in her life she's gonna have to forgive him and Sharon. Not forget, forgive. Or not and be cool with a strained relationship is genuinely totally valid.", "NTA your dad was a terrible father and husband.  He is not someone you can depend on, move on and enjoy your wedding.", "NTA\nAnd honestly I think for the best. Your father has consistently chosen Sharon over his kids\u2026 why would he stop now? \n\nHe did the slow fade from his children\u2019s lives after choosing the mistress over his family. \n\nI know it\u2019s hurtful but our parents are not paragons of virtue. They make mistakes. They make harmful choices. And sometimes, they are just straight up bad people. \n\nMight be for the best that your father doesn\u2019t cast his cheater shadow over your nuptials ya know?", "He\u2019s been a shit dad, and at least you invited him \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. Of course you don\u2019t want your fathers affair partner at your wedding.", "Since your father respected your boundaries, be prepared for your life without your father.

Hope you have an amazing wedding.", "NTA - It's your wedding your entitled to have and not have who you want there to enjoy your day.  If your dad doesn't want to be there because of Sharon that's his loss not yours.

You are free to not invite her but he is equally within his rights to decline the invitation.

Given the background, I understand. You're allowed to feel upset, but you need to respect his decision. He's *allowed* to decline.", " NTA. Your request was reasonable especially given  that he likely could've had an EA or PA with this woman prior to your parents divorce with how quickly he moved in with her.

And don't ever forget it.", "NTA", "I hate downvotes, but YTA. You don't see your parents as human beings. They are still your mom and dad. They are not persons with their own feelings, lives, experiences, hopes, etc. Grow up. She is the woman your father loves. Regardless of your feelings, it is a package deal. If you want your dad, then there is his wife. \n24 is old enough to understand such matters.", "NTA.", "I'm assuming OP is inviting her cousins' wives, her coworkers' wives, 1st, 2nd and 3rd wives of family friends. To single out her father's wife to uninvite is immature, rude and mean-spirited. A plus one would have been a passive aggressive slap in the face. Those are given to single guests so they can drag along someone they know (but the inviter may not) as a human shield against inane conversations with uninteresting strangers.\n\nSince Dad's on the guest list, the invitation should read \"Mr. and Mrs. Daddio.\" Period.\n\nIt's clear to me that OP is engaging in childish manipulation based upon beliefs and opinions formed as a child, as viewed through the unsophisticated lens of a child. Children cannot understand the intricacies of an intimate, adult relationship nor the psychology of parental attempts to shore up the home team against homewrecking invaders. OP banked on being able to manipulate Dad through tearful emotions, giving him the old \"it's me or her\" ultimatum dressed in \"my big day\" bridal finery. Lead, meet balloon.\n\nHad she taken the mature high road and included Sharon, chances are Sharon wouldn't have come anyway. Why in the world would she? The bride could have come off smelling like a rose from her bouquet for her graciousness. Instead everybody's upset. Dad's not coming. He won't be in the wedding pics. Everytime she looks at her wedding album or video the \"ick\" will be there. Her beautiful day is now, and forever, tarnished.

All hail the sphincter queen!", "NTA, it would be better if you didn't invite your \"father\" since he's just a ghost and causes problems like this, he has half a foot out of the relationship with his daughters so take the other foot out so he stays out, so you know what are you in", "NTA\n\nI relate so, so much to this. Exact same story. But I decided to invite wicked mistress, since I was inviting my step father (who was an angel!). I regret it so, so much.

I never forgave him for that. \n\nI am no very LC with my dad (we see each others once a year) after I spent years trying to maintain a relashionship with him. He has not made a single effort to be in his grandchildren\u2019s life. So I just gave up. My dad is a narcissistic asshole, will always be sadly.

When you have children, his disinterest will hurt even more.", "NTA.  Father's behavior since he left has shown his priority was building a new family with Sharon and her kids.

That wasn't fair of her to do. I understand she was hurt but it wasn't the children who should have to comfort her. You also openly admit you never tried to form a relationship (I assume) because of your mom and not wanting to hurt her. You guys shouldn't have had to deal with all that. You can invite who you want but if he's been remarried for several years now it is shitty to not invite his spouse just because of yet again your mom.", "ESH you can\u2019t place blame on your dad and then take it out of the new wife.

In my opinion, it is disrespectful to invite someone to a wedding and blatantly exclude their Spouse.\n   If the spouse is unwelcome to attend, don\u2019t invite their partner.  If anyone invited me to a wedding, and told me my wife wasn\u2019t welcome, I would decline.

Decent parents stay parents after a divorce. They don't push their kids away and only do things with their new family / stepkids.", "No, it was only the mistress and one of the causes of the divorce because the other is Op's father.", "You don't invite one half of a married couple to a wedding.

She asked if SHE was TA for not inviting Sharon.  In that, she is NTA.\n\nHer Dad being TA is a whole other question.  Her dad is obviously the AH for leaving his marriage for his affair partner and his kids obviously have the right to reject him for that reason.  The amount of unfaithful spouses that just move from one household to another and expect the children to be okay with this mind boggling, but it happens all the time.\n\nOP absolutely has the right to restrict Plus Ones for her parents, especially since she was fair and did it on both parents, but she also has to accept his answer since she made that stand.  She also has the right to be hurt and she is, but she took that chance when she drew the line in the sand.  I 100% support her decision of the Plus One and she was super respectful to go to her father and talk to him about it.  But, she also has to accept his decision, as hurtful as it is for her.", "Well not giving someone a plus one, especially only inviting one half of a married couple, is an AH move for a wedding as well.\n\nIf OP doesn't want the wife there that's fine but it is a breach of wedding etiquette and the dad is fine to decline going solo.", "Is it your opinion that one should be stuck in a loveless marriage then?
