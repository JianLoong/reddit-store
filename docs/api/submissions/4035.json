He racked us up in a load of debt when I was 15 so since I\u2019ve been 17, I have been making conscious sacrifices for my family. Some of these include working an average of 2-3 jobs on top of full-time studies (College and University) while paying for rent every month at my mom\u2019s house.\n\nNow, I (F25) left home around 2 years ago after graduating as my mom\u2019s then boyfriend was a drunk and abusive. He also didn\u2019t have a job so was living rent-free (while I paid) and would lay on the couch all day drinking. It was a horrible environment to live in and we lived in a small city so there was nothing for me job-wise. I felt bad about leaving but also had no other choice so went to the big city and got a full-time job.\n\nEver since then I\u2019ve been paying my mom\u2019s credit card bill off every month, paying the phone bills, sending my sister an allowance every month and also helping out when needed while also paying for my rent, student loans, car, bills etc. Before I left, I even paid off \u00a32000 of the credit card and I also lent her \u00a31000 for a house deposit which she said she would give back but after a year of lying to me about property agents holding it back due to damages, she admitted she spent the money.\n\nDue to the cost-of-living crisis, I\u2019ve found myself struggling. I\u2019ve made it clear that I can try to help where I can but last week, my mom texted me asking for \u00a3800 for rent. She admitted that she gambled it away and the landlord had given her 24 hours' notice or else. Of course, I exploded and finally stood up for myself saying that I felt used and taken advantaged off. I gave her the money but also exchanged some harsh words and was very obviously angry (called her an idiot, the F word used a lot and told her to get her life together.) Because of this, I only have enough to pay off my rent this month, pay off my cat\u2019s castration plus food. I cannot afford to buy new tyres for my car to drive home for Christmas or even get presents so have told her I cannot and will not be coming home for Christmas.\n\nThis has caused quite the stir and my mum has now blocked my number (after I called her out for using the credit card after seeing her partying on Saturday night when apparently she had no money). My little sister is also angry with me but she does not know the reason why we argued. \n\nI feel super torn about this but personally think I have every right to be upset and build up some boundaries as the gambling was the last slap in the face. However, I am from an Asian background so know there is a big expectation from me to help out my family but also think that is out-dated and I have every right to support myself and my future.\n\nSo redditors, am I the asshole for finally having enough?", "created_utc": 1670249413, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zd7qo4/aita_for_ruining_christmas_by_standing_up_for/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's super uncommon for children to move out of their parents' house and it's even expected sometimes that the parents live with their child's family when they are grown and married. Hence why it's been super hard for me to shake off paying for everything as I've been made to feel ungrateful, ashamed and guilty for it in the past. And due to childhood trauma, felt like I wanted to avoid having those feelings added on and didn't want to be \"banished\" from my family as they are all I have. I expect my mother has told my uncles and aunties about this so preparing myself for even more backlash as they would probably take her side.\n\nMy sister is 17 and I managed to help her find a job so that she can start savings of her own.

She will never leave your gravy train. She had you. You are not responsible for her. She is an adult. She can suffer the consequences of her actions.", "NTA . A lot harsh maybe. But justified. \n\nYour mother is taking advantage of you. She knows she has you to enable her and will continue to pay her bills. She has no reason to be responsible. \n\nI understand your frustration and it\u2019s valid. I also understand the concern about your cultural expectations. While you are justified to want to cut the toxic relationship and stop giving her money, I can also see why you\u2019d feel guilty or afraid of being criticized in your culture and family and close friends for not doing what is expected of you. However, there are things you could do to prevent her from having cash to spend on alcohol or gambling. Like pay her rent directly to the landlord. Pay the bills directly to the creditor. Buy your sister the things she needs rather than sending cash.  \n\nBut, I\u2019d definitely cut off the credit cards. If they\u2019re in your name and your mom is an authorized user, take her off and get a new credit card number issued. If she owns the card, quit paying it. It\u2019s extremely expensive to pay for the interest and it does nothing to help her learn to budget and live within her means. \n\nBut honestly, if you don\u2019t want to contribute to them anymore, then you should do that without feeling guilty. It\u2019s your mother\u2019s responsibility to get her act together. Until she has a reason to, she won\u2019t. Tough love is sometimes needed. Not to mention that you\u2019re never going to be able to prosper yourself if you give everything extra you have to her.", "NTA. And you should have an honest conversation with your sister about the money issues.  If you can afford to help in the future - keep it to only practical things. Pay the landlord directly.

She\u2019s just turned 17 and now legal to work, so I managed to help her find a job so that she can start saving and funding herself. She lives with my mom.", "While I agree with most of what you said, OP didn't give any indication that she had been aware her mother had a gambling problem; she mentioned that her *father* did, but he isn't around.", "Thanks for that - I think that\u2019s where my guilt comes from. I\u2019m fortunate that I have a good job where I earn enough to keep myself and family afloat but recently after my car breaking down, general cost of living going up and my mom\u2019s current boyfriend giving me a cat to look after - money has been tight. \n\nSo in my head, I\u2019m being unfair as I know I have a good paycheque coming in at the end of the month and could help but also at the point of exhaustion where I feel like I\u2019ve done and am doing so much but yet it seems like it\u2019s never enough. Like I\u2019ve not yet been able to see any of the fruits of the labour I\u2019ve been putting in since I was 17, if that makes sense?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I wouldn\u2019t help out at all but if you still want to either send money directly to the landlord for work or pay specific bills directly. Don\u2019t go over set amount no matter what and make sure she doesn\u2019t have any of your credit card info.", "I had absolutely no clue! This is the first time she's ever mentioned it. As far as I know, all the money I've ever sent her has gone into rent or food.\n\nThere's currently a big cost of living crisis in the UK so I imagine desperation for money pushed her into trying out gambling and due to lack of experience, she completely spunked her money in one go.", "Make sure she starts her own bank account so that your mom doesn't steal her money or beg her for it.\n\nAlso, NTA.", "This is correct - this is the first time my mom's ever mentioned that she's gambled. I'm so surprised she even knows how to do it as she's your typical \"don't know how to use a computer\" type of mom. But she said she lost it all on an online lottery game? Didn't dive into too many details as I was raging at the time. No idea where it came from but yes, it was my father who had an extreme gambling addiction.", "She may have been aware, she may not have been. Those details  were left out or not included in the post. I can only make an assumption.", "It does make sense, you've felt a sense of duty to support your family because you are able to do so.\n\nBut as other commenters have alluded to, it sounds as though giving them more money at this stage is only helping them continue their poor habits and not actually helping them to better their lives as you have done for yourself.\n\nIn my opinion you should feel no guilt to decide to draw a line under that time in your life and focus more fully on giving your own family the best life that you can.", "At this point you are not doing them any favors you are enabling them and also you need to focus on your on life.  You cannot take care of their home and have a home yourself.", "Stopping the credit card is key. But I think giving to the mom would hopefully help her learn to budget versus giving to the landlord just erases one bill so she doesn't think about being responsible for it at all.", "No one blames you for trying to help your mom. I get it, its the same here in the U.S. Cost of living has gone up so much and its difficult to make ends meet.  I agree with you, your mom needs to get her shit together though. Do what you can for you and your sister. If your family calls, tell them the reason and the truth and leave it at that. If they continue to harrass you, tell them they need to give her money then, because you simply cannot afford it anymore.", "So, not having the actual facts at your disposal, you decided to make some up in your head and judge her based on those. Is that the way you would want people to judge you?", "Lol, its not judgement. I dont judge her for trying to help her mother, I made a guesstimate that she knew her mom had gambled the money away before. Its not like im accusing her of killing a cat. Calm down there, social justice warrior."]}
