You need to say goodbye to her.\n\nYou then need to decide what\u2019s best for you: Can you have a relationship with your mother exactly as she is now? Do you want to? What would that look like?

You can only change how much power you allow her to have to keep disappointing and hurting you.\n\nAs someone who went through a similar journey I promise there is a way to peace.

You just get some wine (for the guests) and let them come see baby? And celebrate you two. You can even do it co-ed.\n\nDon\u2019t invite your mum tho", "I\u2019m with your mom. Hate these showers! Take the money and buy what you need. If a friend or co-worker or family member of the father want to throw a shower, what\u2019s stopping them? Being the center of attention while people sit and watch you open gifts may be for some, but not everyone.", "NTA \n\nYou asked if she was throwing one she said yes she is planning one with your aunt and it was all a lie yet people are saying YTA!? \n\nShe throws one for your sister in law but not you because you should understand or feel the same way as her and people think YTA because it\u2019s fair that she assumes you feel the same way as her!? \n\nYou are justified in feeling slighted and you are justified in telling her so. She should have just been honest from the beginning so that if someone else in your life wanted to throw for you they could.", "Yta she offered you money for things and you could throw your own little party if you wanted", "YTA. \n\nThe words selfish and entitled come to mind. \n\nSeeing as you knew how your mums felt about them all along, she probably thought you\u2019d understand.

It can also be a nerve wracking time and sometimes you\u2019d like to feel supported. A baby shower is a great way to show a new mom they are and that they have people who they can rely on. \n\nClearly, your mom is not interested in throwing you this shower but I have heard it isn\u2019t polite to ask your parents to throw you one. Think of how much effort and resources your mom has poured into raising you, even if you feel she has failed in some ways, she\u2019s probably given you a lot that you could be grateful for. \n\nI think you should just decide to throw your own party and take some of the stress of figuring out who will throw it off your plate. But, I maybe you could ask your mom and another family member or two to help you plan for the party (diy decorations, help send out invites, make arrangements for food/drinks etc) that way no one is solely responsible for throwing the whole thing! It could be a nice way for you to bond with your mom and bring you two together. It would also be a way for her to show she wants to support you without having so much on her plate. If she doesn\u2019t want to be a part of it at all then maybe you need to reevaluate your relationship and what you can reasonably expect from her in the future. It was around the same time in my pregnancy two people offered out of the blue to throw me two different baby showers so who knows!\n\nSo sorry how brutal everyone is being in the comments here. Hope you the best with the rest of your pregnancy and that you can feel supported in this last stretch of pregnancy!", "YTA. Obviously it\u2019s easy to blame your mother for everything wrong in your life. Truth be known it\u2019s NOT your mother that would throw you a shower. It would be a sister, maybe a sister in law but most generally they are thrown by your friends. I think it\u2019s horrible how you treated your mother. You are quite entitled that is clear.

I don\u2019t know why some people are being downright cruel to you in the comments.

I\u2019m sure it doesn\u2019t feel good when coworkers ask about the shower- again, they probably expect you to have one become it\u2019s common. What are you supposed to do, ask a non-family member to throw a party for you?

However, it seems like your mom has a tradition of treating you like an outcast.  \n\nESH.  Your mom sucks for being horrible and you do because you are mistreating yourself by still hoping she will pull through.  Also, for arguing with the judgements of others when you came to a judgement sub.  These people only have limited information to go on and it was provided by you.", "NTA \n\nIt seems this is the straw that broke you, there seems a hugh amount of back story where you have been hurt by her actions. I think maybe you wanted her to be the mother you needed but she is not. \n\nThe fact she organized a shower for your SIL but not for you tells you everything.

At 30 years of age, you should be long past the stage in your life of feeling entitled. Throwing you baby shower is something someone should willingly do out of the goodness of their own heart; not because you have the expectation that you deserve one.", "Esh. Sucks that she did it for others, but not for you. However, I get the feeling that she felt as if she could be honest with about how she actually feels about baby shower. I also do not like baby showers I find them annoying and tacky. \n\nWith that being said you are also acting like an AH by blowing up at her. Nobody owes you a party. Also if you are still suffering from abandonment issues then I think it might be best to look into therapy because screaming at others the way you did makes you a huge AH.

Especially if she threw one for your sister in law ???", "My biggest point of sympathy with OP is regretting the decision not to celebrate life in general.  I wholeheartedly agree that celebrations are too important to skip.  Now you have an exciting opportunity to create a new precedent with your own child.\n\nIf you don't have family support, learn how to stage your own parties in a low-key but satisfying way that doesn't lead to stress, burnout, and more resentment.  Staging your own shower with the expectation of receiving gifts is gauche, but nothing at all wrong with just a party for friends.\n\nMaybe your mother could get on board with contributing a little something if she doesn't feel overwhelmed with total responsibility?  On the other hand, maybe she will disappoint again, but that doesn't mean you have to sit at home joyless and alone.  Have a party and raise an extra toast, with or without her!", "YTA. You\u2019re thirty years old! Why is it your mother\u2019s job to maintain your relationships with your family for you? I\u2019m sure there are other people in your life who can help you organise a shower if you want one that badly. Why does it have to be her job?", "YTA\n\nYou obviously have some big issues still unresolved in your life and you are a fully grown adult about to become a mother. Instead of yelling at your mother, accept her offer of a cash gift and use it for therapy. That will be more useful to you and to your child than any baby shower would have been.\n\nIf you don't believe me, let me convince you:\n - You have resentment over not having previous celebrations because your mother apparently talked you out of them. This resentment will not disappear on its own. It may however fade when you accept that the past is not changeable, when you investigate why you let your mother talk you out of things you wanted, when you feel strong enough to know that you can arrange your own celebrations in the future, when you forgive your mother for probably acting out of her own social anxiety\n- You don't actually need a baby shower to see your family. You can host a party yourself (not a shower) and invite them. They may not all come, of course, but you are an adult. You have agency in your social life.\n- If you still really want a shower, you could ask someone else to organise it, or even organise it yourself.\n- Your mother trusted you with honesty and vulnerability and you acted out like a toddler. This is not a sign of good emotional regulation. Therapy can help you understand and regulate your feelings.\n- If you had acted as a person with agency, by accepting what you already knew, deciding what you wanted and doing what was in your power to do (not forcing others) you could have had the celebration you wanted. Now you just feel bad and your mother feels bad. You didn't make the useful choice. Therapy can help by making your life materially better as a result of better decisions.", "YTA.  Wow.  The entitlement and the assumptions.  And why haven't you come right out and asked if she was, so you could make plans accordingly?    And you KNEW she hated baby showers the whole damn time?

She went out of her way for your SIL, but has a history of short changing you. STOP expecting her to change.

Now it seems people have a baby shower/celebration for each kid.", "Well, given that daughter was adamant about expecting it, at the very least mother and daughter don\u2019t communicate well \ud83e\udd37.", "Good and valid points. Thanks for this perspective. Lol \ud83d\ude02", "Holy shit, if you actually think this you need serious therapy. That's not how any of this works. Holy shit dude.", "You sound insufferable, I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re bringing a child into the world having such extreme reactions to small things such as this.", ">How could one have high expectations if there was never an opportunity to have a damn expectation?!\n\nWell clearly you do?!", "THIS. These replies are insane acting like OP is an asshole for expecting her mom to do something so many moms happily do. I think OP has only been an asshole to herself for expecting her mom to ever behave like a mother should.", "Yess", "Yeah that's way bigger than any work baby shower I've heard of. The work baby shower is like the birthday cake at the office equivalent. A meeting with some small gifts and small refreshments. It's also a \"temporary goodbye\" party too, since normally the mom is about to go on leave too.", "She had hopes, and once again, for the hundredth time in her life, her mum crushed them.", "From my experience, there's showers by coworkers and showers from family. You'd never invite family to the office shower.", "I'm sure your mom screwed up raising you. A lot of parents do. I'm asking this because I'm genuinely curious and not because I'm trying to make you feel bad. \n\nWhy did you expect your mother to act different than how she usually does? What kind of conversations did you have with your mother about the baby shower?", "But you aren\u2019t a social outcast you have coworkers and they seem eager to help so tell them no one is and maybe one will offer to throw you one? You have no friends?", "Please read what you wrote. You are saying you feel like a social outcast because your mom doesn\u2019t want you to throw you a baby shower.  Clearly your mom isn\u2019t the type of mom you want, sucks but it is what it is.  Expecting her to be fake to spare your feelings? K. \n\nWhat about your MIL? Or SIL? Someone else in your life that fits your ideal.", "You sound like an absolutely miserable person who expects or from the sound of this, demands others to do as you wish. You need serious help. Unfortunately, you're child will suffer because you're such a narcissist. Wish I didn't read your post, but you're a huge AH.", "LOL, you do realize what you're saying is Hey mom, I don't care how you feel or what you want. I want a party in my honor and to be the center of attention. So shut up and make me happy.\n\nNarcissistic Much?", "Exactly, showers at work are usually tiny and you\u2019re lucky if everyone has a couple minutes to eat a piece of cake before they run back to keep on working. They\u2019re a nice gesture but I don\u2019t think your family and friends are all coming to your break room with presents.", "You\u2019re asking the woman whose parents haven\u2019t thrown her even a single birthday in her entire life why *she* can\u2019t compromise? Are you being serious??\n\nOP has compromised her entire fucking life. Yet her mum was able to put her feelings aside for her DIL twice, but is unable and unwilling to do the same for her daughter.\n\nThese comments are truly astounding", "The post says she declined her mother's reluctant offer."]}
