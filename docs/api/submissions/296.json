If there was no one in line who needed it, I see no reason why it should have gone unused.  Even if there was a handicap person in line, you don't have to let them go straight to the front simply because the accessible bathroom became available.  Someone might if they choose to, but it isn't necessary.  Also, a handicap parking space is not even comparable, IMO.  You must have a placard to park in a handicap space, you don't need anything special to use the bathroom.", "NTA. That stall is made accessible for disabled people, they are not there exclusively for them.\n\nAlso, some people have disabilities that are not visible to the naked eyes. Not all disabled people have crutches or a wheelchair, so people shouldn't be so quick to judge.", "If there was no one waiting in line who needed additional accomodations of the accessible stall (used cane, crutches, wheelchair, walker, etc) then NTA.", "So in a restroom of 12 people waiting to releive themselves, you are just supposed to let the handicapped stall sit vacant in the chance event a handicapped person might show up.  And let the remaining 3 stalls service the line.  \n\nThat person with the comment and the other 11 of you with opinions can watch me use this stall and hear me blow it up while you clutch your pearls and tsk-tsk at me.\n\nThat was a handicapped ACCESSIBLE stall.  Its not a handicapped RESERVED stall.  Use it and have nothing to be ashamed about.  NTA", "NTA, I'm assuming that there wasn't someone who needed the accessible stall in line. In that case, they should have gone. But to my knowledge, bathroom etiquette is thus:\n\n1. If there are multiple stalls available, do not take the accessible one\n2. If there is someone in line who needs the accessible stall, prioritize them\n3. If there is a line and the accessible stall becomes available and nobody in line needs the accessible stall, the next person in line *should take the stall to keep the line moving*\n\nI have been in so many bathroom lines in my life, and I've never seen this be a problem.", "It is handicapped accessible, not handicapped reserved.\n\nBy the parking space logic, should you also not walk on a wheelchair ramp?  Or push the automatic door open button?\n\nThe stall is to accommodate people who need accommodation.  That doesn\u2019t mean they automatically get to skip a line.", "NTA", "As a disabled person, NTA. I might be a little irritated if you were in there a long time but if you were just in there for what you needed to do then them complaining is silly. Also they shouldn't have judged you because invisible disabilities exist and for all they know you could be invisibly disabled.", "NTA. If there's no one in line who can only use the handicapped stall then it's just another toilet. It's stupid not to use it.", "Nta, and as an fyi, in america the handicap provisions are required if you have to offer public restrooms.  Even if it is a 1 toilet room.  All the other non-handicap toilets are there to add capacity.  \n\nSo to the ladies harping at you, if it was a 1 toilet room, no one could go in because that is the handicapped stall.\n\nI say, Get in, get out, and if someone with a disability is waiting when you come out, say something like, sorry, but at least its now cleaner than i found it.", "As someone who needs the disabled stall...use it if it's empty. Don't hang around obviously, but it's definitely not the same level as a parking spot where cars are left for indeterminate amounts of time. NTA", "NTA. There was a line, and nobody in that line truly needed to use it. If someone in a wheelchair came in they\u2019d still have to wait their turn in line, right? You\u2019d be done by then so it wouldn\u2019t even matter.", "NTA - That comparison is apples to oranges. Handicap accessible restroom stalls and parking spaces are completely different. Parking spaces are exclusive and require permits. Restroom stalls are inclusive and have no requirements, just like handicap accessible elevators, wheelchair ramps on sidewalks, etc.", "NTA.  The accessible bathroom stall is larger with accommodations for differently-abled people.  There is not a ticket to bypass the line to the bathroom stall; this isn't Disney.\n\nI would have used the accessible bathroom stall if I were waiting.  The snarky woman with her comments can just mind her own business.", "If you use the accessible bathroom you use it quickly and you don't use it if someone says they're disabled and need the bathroom. NTA", "Anyone can use the bathroom stalls. They are not only for people with disabilities. (They usually put changing tables in those stalls too. So, that's how you know anyone can use the toilet in those stalls.) And I would have told the lady behind me that her turn was coming as soon as an available stall presented. \n\nNTA. No~~t~~ even a worthy debate IMO. No worries. \ud83d\ude02", "NTA  you are correct....first is first.", "The stall is accessible but not limited to only physical disabilities. There is no bathroom police that is going to ticket you like they would if you parked in a handicap space. NTA", "NTA If we made a policy that the accessible toilet could only be used by the disabled then everyone would end up waiting longer. That said if a disabled person wants to jump the line to get to the accessible toilet,I'd be fine with it.", "If there's person that truly needs that accessible stall, regardless if they came in at 13th in the line, they go right ahead to that one when it becomes available. \n\nOtherwise, it's fair game and just an empty unused stall creating a backlog if you don't use it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Others have invisible illnesses.  If you saw me in line, or someone said \u201cI can only use the accessible stall, because of [vague reference to her invisible illness]\u201d, I bet you would defer to us, right?  If so, and I\u2019m assuming so, NTA. \n\n1 out of 6 people don\u2019t *have* to use the accessible stall, so it\u2019s unreasonable to make 12 people wait, with it empty. \n\nParking spaces work differently, because they have slow turnover.  Bathroom stalls have fast turn over, just let those who need the space/railings/etc go first.", "I use crutches and have a service dog.  While I can *manage* in a regular stall, if I have to (but not quite always) the accessible one is dramatically easier.    You are absolutely correct.  Just defer to those who appear to need it, and to anyone who says they have an invisible need for it, and use it in turn.", "For disabled people.  The cutsy phrases and Euphemisms appear to have come from able bodied teachers and parents of disabled kids in a well meant but misguided attempt to make them feel better about themselves by denying reality, instead of teaching them to recognize and love themselves as they are.  \n\nThere is nothing shameful about being disabled.  We use euphemisms to cover up and avoid words describing things we find shameful.  So\u2026using euphemisms like \u201cdifferently abled\u201d makes the disabled community, in general, want to tear its hair out in frustration.  Just say disabled.  It\u2019s not a bad word. It\u2019s not insulting.  Just be pragmatic.  No point in not doing so. \n\nI, with my crutches and service dog, and everyone else I know who is disabled, thank you for listening."]}
