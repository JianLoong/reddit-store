Your child is not her responsibility and she does not owe you childcare regardless if you live together or not. \u201cHelping around the house\u201d has nothing to do with childcare.

You don't get to hold it over her head that she lives with you so she has to babysit a child *you* decided to make.

You and you ALONE are responsible for caring for your child.  If you want to hire a nanny, you are free to do so.  In fact, you could ask your SIL if she wants to work as a nanny.

It's even worse if you assume that she OWES you free childcare.  \n\nShe says it's not her responsibility and she didn't sign up for this.  Exactly.  You can't just pop out a kid and expect others to care for the kid just because they are THERE.\n\nShe says you need to step up as a mother and you need to get a job.  Yes.

You are a SAHM, so be one. If you need help, ask for it and do not demand it. You are not owed child care.

I'd say you have to be shitposting but you're a teenager, so I actually believe that you believe that you have a right to call someone else lazy for not taking care of your kid when THAT'S LITERALLY YOUR OWN ONLY JOB. \n\nDon't get me wrong: recovering from childbirth can be exhausting, and being a SAHM can be really hard . . . a few months down the line, when he's actually more than just a hungry, sleepy potato. But girl, I have a friends who are twice your age and dealing with infants with health issues and active toddlers whilst coping with the challenges of being *severely disabled and/or seriously chronically ill* themselves, and they are outrageously grateful if a friend stops by to help once a week or so.

The first few months of a baby\u2019s life are absolute hell in terms of sleep deprivation.
