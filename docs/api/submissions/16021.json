There's usually rules against that. So even if there were personal items, I would've given them to the lost and found because it had been there all day without being claimed. \n\nSo the fact that it was just random towels on it (the normal sign of people being done with the towel and chair) is the fact that it was u claimed. \n\nAnd how do we even know they 'dibbed' it? Could've just been trying to spook you out of the chair so they can enjoy it. Almost worked too, but good for standing your ground. Next time they should label their name if anything", "Lots of places like resorts and cruise ships have rules about how long you can claim an unattended lounge chair. I've never seen one allowing dibs for longer than 30 minutes, whether you leave personal effects or not.\n\nNTA", "NTA- a crumpled resort towel is not a personal possession. The fact that you were there for more than half an hour without anyone coming to claim the chairs tells me you are good.", "The fact that there were only crumpled resort towels makes this NTA. If it was someones personal items, I'd say differently. \n\nSetting items down to reserve spots is very common, but it needs to be something that distinguishes it from trash. There was no way to know if those towels were reserving spots or left there from swimming patrons.", "I work in a library that provides access to 6 small private study rooms to the public. Rooms are available on a first-come/first serve basis. They cannot be reserved. Someone can come in at 9AM when we unlock the doors and stay until 6PM when we close. The doors are set to lock so that our patrons can leave for a few minutes to use the toilets or just to step outside for a bit of fresh air. \n\nOur only rule is that people cannot use them as a closet. People were coming in, leaving their bags, coats, etc. in them, then going on the public computers for hours on end.  So now there are signs posted that staff will remove any items left in r=the rooms if the owner has not been in there for 20 minutes.  \n\nI can't tell you how many people get all bent out of shape that we have dared to touch their belongings and given \"their\" room to another.", "They spat? Well then. Obviously this means they have the moral high ground!\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI\u2019ve been to a lot of places where you can\u2019t reserve chairs and I love it. (The staff will come around and move people\u2019s stuff off the chairs if unattended lol)\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to pop out for five minutes to go pee. But you can\u2019t reserve chairs that you aren\u2019t using for hours and hours. If you care you should leave a person behind and bring them back food or whatever", "NTA. People who leave their stuff also know that \"dibs\" isn't really a thing in these situations, but rely on people generally feeling uncomfortable moving other people's stuff. Leaving a resort towel might as well be doing nothing.", "NTA.", "NTA, this poxy chair-\"reserving\" needs to stop, or resorts need to start to wisen up and make people pay to have a dedicated lounge chair.\nAFAIK many resorts are already clamping down on this behaviour because people are hogging chairs all day and not using them.", "NTA - what are we in elementary school?", "It\u2019s like they either didn\u2019t actually save the seats, or didn\u2019t want to risk their stuff by leaving it there, so they left towels. It\u2019s not your fault that they chose such a non-committal, and super common item around a pool as a way of saving a seat. NTA, and I\u2019m glad you kept your seat since you were actually there.", "NTA chairs in public spots are for people, not things", "NTA, they used towels, that could imply they were used, or they were empty, you don't know. If they really cared that much, they would send one person to get food, while the other guards the chairs, it was the easiest thing to do when we were on vacation (although people would get mad that my mother got the food and drink while boyfriend and I relaxed, we took turns being the food bringer)", "NTA. it\u2019s one thing to leave actual personal items (like a bag or something where you know it was owned by someone) on the chair but if it\u2019s a resort towel with no obvious owner (and 40 minutes later), how could you be wrong", "NAH. Isn\u2019t reserving longe chairs forbidding at most resorts?", "There's some stuff to unpack here. First, I resent this \"calling dibs\" or reserving a seat, especially at festivals or the beach where a person can claim the place for hours and not even sit there for most of the time. That being said, if there is a custom where people say dibs, that custom should be respected, the fact that a rule is stupid does not mean that the rule does not apply..should is not the question here. The question is whether people can expect that the dibs rule will be respected and unless the place you where had any other system for regulating the seating on the lounge chairs then I guess the rule does apply. Also, the fact that they were disheveled towels shouldn't really matter unless you are going to make sure that the person actually is the owner of said towels, which I don't think is a question here. **BUT**, since this is an unregulated seating arrangement where people can just create their own rules and claim possession of lounge chairs and abuse that possession then I believe the laws of the jungle apply and everyone can fend for themselves.
