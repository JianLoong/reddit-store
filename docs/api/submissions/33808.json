We have a fairly large home which makes it easy to host parties. Also my husband loves entertaining guests. \n\nHere is the hell that I went through the last 4 days. \n\nFriday- our daughter had her \u201cfriendsmas\u201d celebration. It wasn\u2019t many people, but 8 wine drunk 19-20 year olds make the noise of about 40 people. \n\nSaturday- (husbands parents are divorced) Christmas with My FILs family. They\u2019re a big family, and love to drink. We had spills, kids having uh ohs, and some belligerent aunts and cousins. We didn\u2019t even cook for this because it was like 30 people. We catered beef sandwiches but with clean up it was still a lot of work. \n\nChristmas Eve- by the time we finally cleaned the house, we had to get ready for Christmas with MILs family. They\u2019re a smaller and tamer bunch, but we did all the cooking. Filets and prime rib, polenta w braised beef, homemade pizzas and some vegetables and salad. Cooking took forever. There\u2019s also a lot of little kids on this side of the family because he had some cousins come with small kids. \n\nChristmas Day- my family came over and we cooked. It\u2019s a smaller bunch, just my parents, my brother and his family, but we still did all the cooking. \n\nI am gassed. I am ready to hibernate for a month. This morning my husband said we should just do New Years for our neighbors (who we usually get together with) I straight up told him I will go to a hotel if he insists on that, and I won\u2019t return until the house is clean. He thinks I\u2019m being dramatic and that it \u201cwasn\u2019t that much work\u201d but it really was. I know he likes entertaining more than me, and I don\u2019t want to sound like a party pooper.

Even when I throw my kids birthday party at places (like the trampoline park) that essentially do everything for you it's still extremely stressful/exhausting lol.

Of course it was that much work but men don't always get that. Let him try to host and clean, and then see how hard it really is!", "NTA! Hosting more than a couple of friends is serious work - the organising/planning/coordinating, the prep before, the actual day, the clean up, and then the catch up on all the stuff you didn't get to while you were doing everything else (laundry etc). \n\nYou've been going non-stop. Maybe go to the hotel anyway, even if there is no NYE party!", "NTA. I\u2019ve been the head of the entertainment department for such a long time and they weren\u2019t my parties. I stopped years ago and when I plan a party I really make it as easy as possible to host/ it\u2019s still exhausting. \n\nBook it. Tell him to hire a cleaning crew and have a good time", "NTA. I don't have to tell you that because you own a uterus that men will take advantage, but here we are.", "NTA - sounds like your husband needs to respect you and your wishes. And, understand how much prep and cleaning is involved.", "NTA - Coming from a family where my mom always was responsible for most of the big family events held at the home, I remember it was an extreme amount of preparation and clean-up and then actually host duties. Very exhausting for her. Personally, I do not understand how you are not completely insane by now. If he is going to do this, a hotel (with a spa) would be a great alternative to you.", "NTA and when someone says throwing another party isn't that much work it's obvious they don't do the pre/post party anything", "NTA. Crimeny I'm tired just READING everything you had to do this past week! That is a TON of work and it sounds like your husband is not only belittling your very valid feelings but clearly does not understand how much work really went into everything. New years is partially on the weekend; head to a hotel Saturday (or even Friday night) and don't come back until late Monday or Tuesday and REST!!!!", "Sounds like an exhausting nightmare.NTA", "NTA but I don't get why other family members can't bring a dish? My aunt always hosts Christmas and she usually provides the main meat (we had ham) and all her siblings and us kids brought dishes to create a full meal. We probably had easily 40 people in her house. Maybe I'm missing something but my family has always done it this way. Enough food to go around and a massive variety of food as well.", "NTA. I\u2019d do the same. Also, think ahead to how you can simplify even more next Christmas. Fewer menu choices, no wine for minors, etc. Also, someone (hubby) saying it \u201cwasn\u2019t that much work\u201d is obviously not taking responsibility for enough of the work, particularly preparing food and sticking with cleanup until it\u2019s completely done.", "NTA.  Im addition to going to the hotel, hire and elderly stripper gram to visit his party.", "NTA that\u2019s too much for anyone. Why does he insist on doing it?", "NTA. I'm guessing it \u201cwasn\u2019t that much work\u201d because he himself did little or nothing?", "NTA, but would you be fine with it if he did all the work? If he's willing to do that, you could agree to see how it goes maybe.

Even giving the benefit of the doubt and presuming your husband did his fair share of the cooking/cleaning, it's your holiday too.

I don\u2019t know how you did all those parties!", "NTA\n\nnot only is it a lot of work to keep hosting parties, this festive season must have cost a fortune in entertaining alone, food, drink etc.\n\nStick to your guns, if he insists on hosting NY, then go away like you threatened and stay away until the house if fully clean and tidy.", "NTA\u2026 if it\u2019s not that much work he shouldn\u2019t have a problem doing it himself \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "My mum used to be the one who did all the party work.

I usually go to a concert every year for NYE and stumble home at 8-10am. This year I might go midnight skiing/bonfire which will be a huge change but still fun.
