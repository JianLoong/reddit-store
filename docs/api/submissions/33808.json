It wasn\u2019t many people, but 8 wine drunk 19-20 year olds make the noise of about 40 people. \n\nSaturday- (husbands parents are divorced) Christmas with My FILs family. They\u2019re a big family, and love to drink. We had spills, kids having uh ohs, and some belligerent aunts and cousins. We didn\u2019t even cook for this because it was like 30 people. We catered beef sandwiches but with clean up it was still a lot of work. \n\nChristmas Eve- by the time we finally cleaned the house, we had to get ready for Christmas with MILs family. They\u2019re a smaller and tamer bunch, but we did all the cooking. Filets and prime rib, polenta w braised beef, homemade pizzas and some vegetables and salad. Cooking took forever. There\u2019s also a lot of little kids on this side of the family because he had some cousins come with small kids. \n\nChristmas Day- my family came over and we cooked. It\u2019s a smaller bunch, just my parents, my brother and his family, but we still did all the cooking. \n\nI am gassed. I am ready to hibernate for a month. This morning my husband said we should just do New Years for our neighbors (who we usually get together with) I straight up told him I will go to a hotel if he insists on that, and I won\u2019t return until the house is clean. He thinks I\u2019m being dramatic and that it \u201cwasn\u2019t that much work\u201d but it really was. I know he likes entertaining more than me, and I don\u2019t want to sound like a party pooper.

Maybe a discussion you've already had multiple times and you feel fairly certain that cleaning will fall on you?\n\nIt's OK to say you'd love to do a neighbor holiday but just not as a host.  It's almost New Year's so is this something that also just ends up falling on your household to host if you usually get together with them but nothing is planned yet?   I hope you get a good break and don't participate when you don't want to. I recall that was very very tiring.", "Just tell him he does all the work....and tell the neighbors too. Then when they show up, you just sit there drinking wine and having someone serve you. If your husband complains (which I'm about 99% sure will happen) you say you agreed that he would do all the work - and you have all the neighbors as witnesses. \n\nI'm sure he will be really unhappy. Sucks to be him, I guess.\n\nNTA", "NTA - you should do it anyways. You sound exhausted. Hell I am exhausted just by reading your schedule for this past weekend.", "Unpopular opinion: either you want people to praise you for how much you do or you\u2019re bad at setting boundaries. Pot lucks are great. Asking for help is great.  Communicating boundaries is great. Deciding to host too much stuff without asking for help \u2026 sounds like a you problem. YTA only because you feel like you have to do everything and can\u2019t say \u201cno\u201d like a normal adult. Tantrums and ultimatums are childish. Next time, just say \u201cno.\u201d", "NTA but don\u2019t ever be the one who has to leave your own home due to someone else. Just tell him no.", "NTA, knowing when to say when is a good thing. Luckily my wife and I  agreed last month that after a ridiculously busy 2023 it was fine to scale back on holiday activities to save what was left of our sanity. Funny thing, even after dropping a couple things we normally do we still ended up too busy this month. So yeah, if she tried to drag me to a NYE party, let alone host, i would have to tell her that she was on her own.", "Not three types of meat but three preparations of the same type of meat - beef. Filet, prime rib, braised beef. Completely unnecessary. OP reminds me of an aunt of mine who used to prepare elaborate gourmet five course meals for parties and then complain about all the work she had to do when in fact everyone would have been just as happy with takeout. Some people have a massive martyr complex.\n\nOP is a soft YTA in my view as it looks like she is bringing a fair amount of this on herself.", "I don\u2019t know how my mother had 9 for dinner on Wednesday, 14 on Saturday, and 6 for Christmas. We treated her to dinner out for Xmas Eve because there was no way we were letting her cook another night. She loves to \u201ccook for an army\u201d, but it\u2019s insanely stressful. There\u2019s a reason why I often reminder her that saying no is an option. If my father decided to host people, I think we would mutiny on her behalf. \n\nNTA!", "I both understand this sentiment, and also would just flat out never attend a party at a restaurant. Sounds impossibly loud and impersonal to my neurodivergent ass :p Give me my safe space of home, extra work be damned.", "Or a clown \ud83e\udd21", "I'm curious (no shade!) how old you are?", "They had events for both her father in law and mother in law - her husband\u2019s side of the family. Saying she\u2019s selfish because she doesn\u2019t want to handle a fifth party is absurd.", "Yeah.\n\nIt's fair for her to say \"these events are important to me, so I am willing to put in the effort. This part isn't important to me, so I am not up for putting in the effort. But I will not stand in your way, if you'd like to make that happen.\"\n\nWhat's wrong with that?", "So we\u2019re just assuming he didn\u2019t do much now?", "I'm not too sure in this case, it's entirely possible that since he's an extrovert and likes hosting that they share a decent amount of the load.  I think everyone here has more energy prepping and cleaning up after something we were looking forward to.\n\nI say this because the amount of work they do shouldn't really be a deciding factor in the situation.  She's drained from having people over because the social aspect is draining.  Saying it's just because the husband doesn't clean up is kind of glossing over her feelings on have so many damn parties.", "If it isn\u2019t that much work, he should have no troubles. Wish him well and check into the hotel.", "Honestly, even if he was doing more than his share, she is still right to reject another party.", "I wanted to ask how much of the work does he do vs OP - didn\u2019t want to make assumptions but have my suspicions on the division of labor\u2026.", "Yes yes yes yes\n\n Either he doesn\u2019t know the amount work involved in organizing and hosting *Or* he *does* understand and actually enjoys it. \n\nEither way, he can put together the party if he wants one and OP is absolutely within her rights to bow out because, for her, it\u2019s frikkin exhausting.", "The comment I was looking for. Also, \u2018we did the cooking\u2019\u2026 is it actually \u2018we\u2019 or is it you OP?", "Our family has never expected the host family to cook everything.  Generally hosts take on the meat/protein/main and everyone else brings the sides and desserts.  Host already has enough cleaning the house, setting tables, cleaning up after, etc.  Only way that works and is fair.", "Some people genuinely feel better/more at ease at their own houses even though it\u2019s extra work - that\u2019s definitely true for me. I like having all my own things at the ready just in case, being in a familiar environment, and having some control over the event (lights, music, food etc - makes a HUGE difference in how long it is til my batteries run out) vs dealing what others choose in many cases. Controlling the guest list is also a big ass deal. And it\u2019s nice as an evening progresses, to know that me and my partner don\u2019t have to find our way home and can drink without thinking about it.\n\nI know I\u2019d rest easier (probably in my own room with the door shut) knowing my young adult kids and their friends were partying at our place vs elsewhere, too.\n\nBetter to be able to change as hours pass and only a core group remains.\n\nJust saying the all four at her house part was the only bit of this post that made it sound bearable.", "My favorite answer ;-)", "30s. I\u2019m either out camping, hiking/backpacking, skiing at the resort or in the backcountry, at concerts, meeting friends at the bar, or at a house party almost every weekend though and we\u2019ve got a really big social circle. Every once in a while I\u2019ll have a lazy, low key video game/movie weekend but they are rare because there\u2019s always so much going on. For NYE a lot we\u2019ll go see some of our favorite bands and they often do a 3-4 night run where we\u2019re going to every show and partying. Always totally cooked after though lol.", "It's being a bit selfish. Ok for her interests, he helps out and maybe he doesn't want to but does. Kind of don't know because we don't know if they don't mind helping each other. But to say that \"I'll go to a hotel\" is a bit dramatic and extreme.", "Gotcha :-) I'm in my 50s, and admire your energy and zest for living it up! Hope your NYE rocks.", "Two of the events were for his parents and relatives, and one was for his child. What on earth are you talking about with the 'her interests that he's helping out with'?", "but that's with their own parents present, not at someone else's house."]}
