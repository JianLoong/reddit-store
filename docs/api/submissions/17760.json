The mortgage,\nproperty taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance, etc?", "8 years??? When did you find out about these mysterious three children?", "There are 4 children in this who have had no say in what happened to  them. They ALL need at least one adult in their life who will consider them. Be the adult and put what the children need first.\n\nAnd if that means you and the girlfriend give up *your* bedroom to sort out the kids, you do that. Because you're the adults that made the decision and they get sucked into it.", "8 years? \ud83e\udd23 Jesus you two are messed up individuals, please DON'T make anymore kids. You're not good people/parents", "Huge YTA", "Yeah, he still remained involved with a mother of three, despite kids being a dealbreaker. How can you expect to be romantically involved with someone and their family not affect your life?\n\nEdit for spelling", "Was just about to edit and say I found it my bad", "Having three children is something you mention on the first or second date.", "Was gonna say the exact same thing before I saw this.", "Omg this story is getting worst and worst. YTA! 8 years what you were expecting to come out the closet when the kids are married?", "There is no mortage.

No worries", "Like, I think you would have to actively work to make sure it doesn't come up in conversation. After a certain age isn't \"do you have kids?\" a getting to know you question when meeting a new potential partner? Or even \"who do you live with?\" or \"tell me about your family\"? Unless this was a hookup where they both developed feelings and decided to try to make it work despite her kids being a dealbreaker I don't understand how this didn't come up first or second date.", "And does your girlfriend, who was on the brink of homelessness, earn more than you?\n\nDid you mutually agree on the room assignments BEFORE agreeing to split the costs of housing 6\npeople?", "Must be the land of denial. \nIn fact now they are living together. \nIf they go holiday together? She stay at the hostel and he stay at the four season? \nFor as much someone wants to believe it he must be the king of idiots to think the children will\nNot at one point enter the relationship.
