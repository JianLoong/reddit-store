But I think she's using you and has been for awhile. No one just \"forgets\" to mention their children, in a dating context, until long enough into a relationship that the other side is emotionally attached. That's absolutely deliberate on her part. While I can speculate as to why, the reality is: she knew or could intuit that her dating pool as a single mom to three kids would be smaller than the dating pool available to her as a single.\n\nShe waited, on purpose, until she was reasonably sure you were emotionally attached enough that she could talk you into staying in a relationship when she couldn't hide the kids anymore. Now you're emotionally attached, and she has financial issues and needs your help and is appealing to you to provide for her.... and by the way also her three kids.\n\nThis is not going to stop. It's going to continue and get worse. If her financial problems are bad enough she needs you to house her and her kids, they are not going to magically and instantly disappear.\n\nLook what's happened. She hid her kids from you until you were emotionally involved with her and didn't want to let her go; then she moved herself and her kids in with you; now she's pushing your daughter out of her and her kids way.\n\nAll those fairytales about evil stepmothers exist for a reason, okay. Historically, women rely on men to provide, but any given man can only provide any given amount and when resources are limited, the women want those resources for themselves and their own kids... *not* going to kids that are not theirs. There have been sociobiological studies on these kinds of phenomena/human behaviors in society; there have been explorations as to why you can find similar variants of these types of cautionary children's tales in multiple cultures, all evolving independently. Everyone has anecdotes too and good stepparents who treat kids as their own are praised precisely because of the stereotype that exists about step parents.\n\nEdit: I almost changed the judgment here to E S H because after some more thought, OP needs to accept responsibility for his own bad judgment in letting his feelings for this woman override the dealbreaker aspect of the kids. I was going to comment also on the arrangement of kids as separate responsbilities of their parents, but on reflection that sounds like it's mostly a financial consideration. But I then wanted to add that a woman who hid her kids from OP is absolutely comfortable manipulating him and I don't see her accepting that he won't financially contribute after she finagled him into (a) going against his own dealbreakers and (b) letting them move in. She knows that she can convince him to break his own rules in her favor; why would she stop until she gets everything she wants?", "ESH, simply because this relationship should have ended the SECOND you found out about her kids. \n\nShe deliberately hid the existence of her children from you, I\u2019m assuming because she knew it would be a dealbreaker.

She might have been playing the long game here.\n\nBut deep down, no matter how emotionally invested you were at the time of her big reveal, you had to have known that it would be a terrible idea to make an arrangement in which children would not be treated equally.

Should he allow one or more of her children to sleep in the master bedroom with them to make it more comfortable for the other kids in their rooms?  Or how about both OP and his daughter sleep on the couch, so each of the boys can have their own room and girlfriend can share the master with her daughter?  \n\n\nIt's not the daughter's fault that her dad's girlfriend is having money troubles or that her dad chose to let them move in, she shouldn't have to be forced to share her bedroom or change bedrooms just to make them a bit more comfortable.", "They are children. He can\u2019t in good faith continue to fuck their mother and treat them like they are subhuman.\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly fine to not date someone with 3 kids if that\u2019s not your cup of tea. But if you\u2019re going to do that, you at least have to accept that you treat the kids with dignity.\n\nIt would be different if she was some rando, like a coworker who he let stay there, then they can all share 1 room and thank their lucky starts. But after being with someone for 8 years, it\u2019s shitty.\n\nHe keeps talking about his boundaries that he himself continues to violate. If you want a casual relationship, then don\u2019t let your FWB move in with you. It is really that simple", "I know someone (my buddy\u2019s ex wife) who dated her next ex husband for a year before telling him she had 2 kids. The dumbass married her anyway", "She should have ended this relationship as well, LONG AGO.  He made it clear to her that he didn't want to be these kids' father or stepfather and that he wasn't going to take from his daughter to give to her kids, and she said she was okay with that.  Maybe the sex was good, but this was never going to be a proper blended family type of relationship.  If she wanted a father and provider for her kids she should have been looking for that.", "He's a delusional asshole. She a woman in desperate financial straits who was hoping that once he came face-to-face with real life, he'd realize how foolish he'd been.", "Gotta love a world where a guy who houses a mom and three kids \"sucks\".", "It\u2019s not unreasonable in a relationship where people have separate dwellings.", "Probably just cares about his loss of access to sex", "I have and my opinion has not changed. ESH.", "It\u2019s absolutely unreasonable in any 8-year relationship with attachment beyond \u201coccasional hook up.\u201d", "Exactly, he's expecting that his kid be respected while deciding her kids don't matter. That's some stupid logic there. My kid matters, but your's don't. Deal?", "Sounds like Mom should figure that out.", "You could say the same thing to her neighbor, her boss, any of her relatives, etc.  Why is OP specifically obligated to be her savior and bail her and her kids out of their financial troubles?  He's not her husband or their father, he just dates her (and he wouldn't have if she'd been honest from the start), that's not the same as taking on the responsibility for providing for her or raising her children.", "You can\u2019t share a home and not be willing to compromise. \n\nIf you\u2019re merging your home and lives, then your daughter needs to start sharing with her future step siblings. The children should be treated equally in their home. \n\nIf your gf\u2019s stay is temporary until she can leave safely, then treat them as guests and make sure they\u2019re comfortable. Don\u2019t stuff you guests into a small room - that\u2019s setting a poor example for your daughter.", "You are just gross. It sounds like at this point she is only with you because she would have been homeless.\n\nIf you actually loved her, you wouldn\u2019t treat her children like they are tumors which she can\u2019t get rid of.\n\nWhere are the other parents?", "It still doesn't make sense that there isn't some sort of attempt at a positive relationship with the kids.  I'm not thinking about a parental relationship, or even the role of stepparent.\n\nBut basic politeness, when they're around each other.  (Which would be inevitable, over the course of eight years.)  The kindness and consideration any adult owes any child.  Recognition of the children as individual human beings, with human worth.", "by housing them?", "3 kids to a room is inhumane? More so than them being homeless? What kind of entailed person are you? I honestly don\u2019t think you know what that word means. All your other scenarios are made up by you. So far the only thing he hasn\u2019t given into is giving them more room in his house. If his house was 1000 sq ft and 2 bd would he still be inhumane for letting them live there instead of the streets?", "8 years they were together for 8 years.", "They have been dating for 8 years ffs", ">These boundaries would have been fine if they didn't live together\n\nBut they do. Which is the point. So saying it would be different if things were different is quite irrelevant.", "No, OP refusing to treat the children like children with children's needs, but instead as random, independent  room mates is inhumane, not to mention impossible. But cheers.", "He is mistreating them by not letting them be homeless?", "How is he treating them inhumanely?", "By treating them like interlopers after an 8 year relationship.", "I could see that being a lie by omission, but I still think the people in this thread are villainizing her too much. People calling her a \u201chobosexual\u201d and all that. They should have gone their separate ways a long time ago because he set a boundary (an unreasonable one imo but a boundary nonetheless) and her kids deserve better than him.", "I literally just told you. Have a good day tho.", "Why do you think he is an unreliable narrator? Seems illogical to make up that she hid having kids  - especially considering he never wanted to dat someone with kids - so it\u2019s a pretty reasonable explanation as to how he ended up with a mom", "Idk. He was completely upfront about not wanting to be in her kid's life because he can't afford it and she AGREED. That's why he kept dating her. That mom should have never gotten with him in the first place. Your kids come first and if someone doesn't want to be in your kid's life then you should not be with them. They are HER responsibility, not anyone else's. She should have never put them in that situation in the first place. And HE should not have continued a relationship with someone that had three kids. Especially if he didn't want to be a part of their lives. So they're both AH.", "Her kids deserve better than her. He's the one housing them", "Did he say when he found out about the kids? Just because they\u2019ve been dating 8yrs doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s known about the kids all that time, hell, he may have only met them shortly before moving in.", "No you didn\u2019t. But go ahead and end the conversation because you can\u2019t answer the question."]}
