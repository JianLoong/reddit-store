You asked him to cancel his plans to go away with you. It's understandable that you want to spend this time with him and are upset he doesn't want to change his plans for you. For that situation alone, I would probably say N A H. \n\nHowever, you then went on to compare an unwillingness to give up his ***preexisting vacation plans*** to refusing to attend a future wedding that you would have planned well in advance or his children's birthday parties. That you feel these things are at all similar is what makes you the asshole.\n\nIf you had already made plans to go away together, and then he decided something else was more important to him, that would be a real problem worth comparing to your hypothetical future honeymoon. \n\nThis ain't that. \n\nSo would you still make the same comparison if he had already made plans for a \"real life\" special event? \n\nIf he didn't want to cancel plans to attend a concert that you weren't also attending?\n\nOr if he didn't want to drop out of a sports tournament that you weren't also participating in?\n\nIf the answer to those questions is \"no,\" as I suspect, you need to recognize that his video game hobby is as important to him as music, sports and other offline hobbies are to other people. You're the asshole.\n\nIf the answer to those questions is \"yes,\" you need to recognize that even if he loves you, he's allowed to have hobbies and interests outside of spending time with you and you can't expect him to drop his plans for you.

(Is it possible he made a commitment to other people to play at the same time?)\n* How long has he known about the wipe vs. how long ago did you ask? \n* You said it's one of the only times your schedules line up, but would you mind clarifying: does that mean, like, \"this is the only vacation we can take all year\" or \"this is one of four potential vacation windows\" kind of thing?", "NTA- Frankly, he\u2019s valuing a video game over your relationship. And it get it, the game is important to him. But sometimes we have to make sacrifices. Two years is a LONG time to go without going away, and it\u2019s not a huge ask on your part for him to make this sacrifice. \n\nI have been skiing since I was a kid, but now I live in Florida. Skiing is still my favorite thing in the world, and some years I get to travel enough to get three weeks on the mountains. But in the first half year, we had a lot to do, and my fianc\u00e9e had three different functions that were important to her. I could have skipped any of these for a ski trip, but sometimes your relationship is more important. I got zero days of skiing for the first time since 2006. Worth it to make my baby happy. The mountains will always be there next year. \n\nAlso, your point about the future is spot on, and some people would call this a red flag.", "Two things I\u2019ll say.\n\nSo I\u2019m just wondering if this game happens to be Escape from Tarkov. Because he\u2019s right in that these times are pivotal in a snowball effect kind of way. Where you are at a potential massive benefit to play when the game resets because it is a leveled playing field. It\u2019s very tempting to find ways to throw a lot of dedicated time to build an initial edge over people that will then enter intermittently over the wipe period. Because if you progress during the initial period a lot then you can to try being on top for the whole wipe without having to dedicate more time after that initial (your efforts put you ahead and that gives you an edge over everyone else for possibly the entire wipe).\n\nSecond. I think he\u2019s caught between two things he loves and this is his hobby. So, I would say that it would go a long way just to acknowledge that you found out why this period is important to him (if the above info made any sense). If you acknowledge you understand why he wants that, I think then you can also say you still prefer having some vacation time together during that time but you understand if he\u2019d want to take the wipe period serious another time. Or see if there\u2019s a way to do a bit of both. \n\nBut even if you want to be adamant about doing the vacation just saying you understand could be a good thing. He\u2019ll grow out of it but still enjoys it now.", "NAH\n\nI also play a game that wipes so I understand wanting to play the first day that he already planned for.\n\nIt's also okay to ask him to skip one, but don't hold his answer against him.

I need more noobs to farm", "exactly the game in question...", "When questing is life.", "This seems like a ridiculous thing to break up over.

If it was the kind of thing where he'd committed to do a time-exclusive activity with friends weeks in advance and there were other options to be together, I think it's fine for him to keep that commitment.

Or does he have to be active when it actually gets wiped for it to go through?\n\nDon't know what game he's playing,  but all the games I've played that had a world wipe, it was the most fun, most competitive part of the game other than high level endgame content. \n\nGetting a fresh new start on a fresh new world with all your guildmates, and you're all first level and you're all competing to see who can level the fastest and find the best gear first, or be the first at a myriad of other things was a whole game in itself. \n\nIf you're a gamer, it's glorious, like you've been reincarnated but have the wisdom of your past life. I fucking love world wipes in my games. Taking that away is like telling a kid they can't have Christmas, but maybe you'll let them open their presents sometime next week.", "OP reminds me of the TikTok trend of women destroying their boyfriends consoles and recording the reaction. I hope the boyfriend is able to find someone who accepts him as he is.", "100% this game is Escape from Tarkov. For last few years it has wiped once around Christmas and once around mid-summer. The devs of that game have recently announced a wipe in August, and a second wipe at some point in December. Exact dates are unknown as of now.", "1) Escape from Tarkov, 100%\n2) Up to 5 people in a squad, solo play is possible\n3) Wipe was announced maybe a week or so ago, but expected since june. There's a bunch of events going on building hype, and the community REALLY wants the wipe asap.\n\n\n@ u/Educational-Oil401: From what I've been told, there's strong-ish evidence the wipe will be on the 10th of august, is there maybe time for your vacation before that date? Could be a possible compromise imo.\n\n(Assuming your BF plays Escape from Tarkov)\nAnd for the record, you're not the asshole. Yes, the upcoming wipe will bring a bunch of new content, but there will be further content along the way until december. In addition to the next wipe that's really not that far away. So if your BF wants to try all the new stuff on release day you can expect a couple rather busy months, probably including christmas as well. From what I've heard there's nothing time-locked coming up, so even if he's a week late he'll probably manage.", ">Is this a game with friends or something he plays solo? (Is it possible he made a commitment to other people to play at the same time?)\n\nSo many people saying \"he's choosing a game over you\" without ever realising that gaming in this day and age is a *social* experience.  It's not just a weirdo hobby in his basement by himself - chances are that he has friends that he plays with, that rely on him and his participation.  A new season or patch or expansion or content reset or whatever is always a big deal.  We book time off work specifically and do extra groceries and meal prep in advance.  Trying to plan something optional in that time is always going to get pushback.\n\nJust because it's not important to you doesn't mean it's not important to him.  You wouldn't book a holiday if he was on a social sportsball team and had matches in that period or try and make him go somewhere else with you if he'd already booked a holiday with his friends.\n\nThat being said - if you aren't interested in having a relationship with him because of this, then don't.  It's really that simple.  Either you care enough about him and his happiness to let him prioritise his hobby for 2 weeks every 9 months or you don't.  If you don't, then why are you even bothering?", "In this situation, OP is you and the boyfriend is the one with a special function important to him. \n\nJust sayin' \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I hate to be that person, but I have to point out that your comment makes it seem like you should be using N A H (No Assholes Here) instead of N T A.

The game usually wipes every 6 months, but this wipe has been much longer than expected and the whole playerbase is antsy about it, so I totally get where he's coming from.\n\nThat said, you are NTA at all here. Dude sounds like he absolutely needs to touch grass for a bit if he's prioritizing a game over going on a trip with you. Tell him he's acting like a little Timmy and you need him to be a Chad.", "It's crazy this is getting downvoted. Why is what she wants to do somehow more important than what he wants to do? Why does her plans get priority? Because it's a videogame? What if it was something else like say, his favorite band was doing a concert that week so he wanted to stay in town for it. Would he be an asshole then? Neither are the asshole here, it's just two adults that want to do different things in their free time and that's fine.", "What is the game? \u2018Bout to check it out \ud83d\udc40", "Appreciate the explanation. I'm not the most knowledgeable on gaming events like this lol.\n\nGiven that information, yea this is tougher than I thought. If this is something that only happens once or twice a year at most, I may have more sympathy for the boyfriend here.\n\nSince this is a 9-month rotation maybe OP can go without him this year and go somewhere with a girl friend or family member. This getting in the way of bigger life events though (like having kids or a wedding) may be something to address in the future.\n\nI'm more of a sports guy so I guess my equivalent can be the Super Bowl. I missed it once in my life for a friend's wedding but it's rare I'll put something else above it. However, I do tend to soften that stance as I get older.

It relates to the scenario at hand, because they obviously haven\u2019t gone away in two years, and OP is asking him to give up his normal routine for this.", "This first reply in this sub, thanks for the info!", "Lmao this is savage, especially coming from a dude with a Tarkov based Reddit username.", "Its escape from tarkov and if you dont have 100  hours to spend lesrning/ being shit i wouldnt bother.", "Escape from tarkov", "Missing the super bowl is a good analogy. Yeah, you can watch it afterwards but it's happened already and the party is over.", "I saw one once and basically cried. \n\nMy husband is a long time gamer whereas I am newer due to my parents thinking it was a waste. It admittedly takes time to interpret what is more or less important timing wise, but thats a thing that's kind of baseline for a partner (or should be) : understanding what is important to them. Some things are more easily skippable than others, but that doesn't mean OP should get to decide which is which.", "Dunno, but personally I ditch anything I do alone for stuff I do with family/friends. Plus, there's another wipe right around the corner anyways, so one could argue her BF won't miss out on much. I don't think OP is unreasonable with her request (or concerns for the future of the relationship tbh).", "\nYou're saying that if your partner really cared about their hobby, in this analogy it's a sports league, and they wanted to win the championship with their friends and teammates you'd see no issue at all telling them they can't play in the championship because you've decided they're going away. That isn't balanced nor is it a compromise. Aren't you the selfish a-hole partner in this hypothetical?", "It's not his normal routine.\n\nIt's something that only happens once every 9 months or so and might never happen again while he has the free time to enjoy it.\n\nHis plans also predated her request to go away together.", "You're welcome! \ud83e\udd70", "Some people take Tark way too seriously, hopefully OPs bf isn't insufferable about it", "100 hours?

He's not paying enough attention to meeeee, so I'll destroy thousands of hours of work and his irreplaceable memories.\"\n\nEven setting aside how ignorant you have to be of your SO's interests and hobbies if you don't realize that's absolutely ***monsterous***, there's also the financial irresponsibility of it.\n\nIf my boyfriend destroyed my gaming PC, I might literally kill him. Even if he backed up my harddrives first. That's a lot of money out the window. \ud83e\udd2c\n\nOP doesn't seem anywhere near that level of bad though, just doesn't get that this is something important to him. If OP's boyfriend isn't willing to give up any of his normal everyday gaming time for her that's a bit different.", "Fair point. I\u2019d still like to know what op is willing to give up. My wife asked me to cut back my time on vidya and I have considerably, not gonna lie that it irks me a bit that I feel like I am the only one having to give a hobbie up because it\u2019s gaming. We had the talk a while back and I pointed out that I\u2019d give up gaming completely if she\u2019d make things more interesting for me, maybe dress skimpier or something, but she didn\u2019t like that and I wound up in the dog house for a bit.", "My skiing window happens once every nine months\u2026", "he's passing up vacay with his gf for it- he's definitely insufferable", "Yeah, gaming still doesn't seem to be a viable hobbie for grown-ups, thanks society. But ideally, if their hobbies don't align, they could try doing their thing at the same time maybe? Like OPs BF plays games while she goes for a run or something? I do think compromises are important, but tbh if my SO asked me to give up a hobbie just to sit around with her I'd have a hard time doing so. \n\nAs for the situation at hand, I don't get to travel much so any trip anywhere is a highlight for me. Plus, I wouldn't say the BF is \"giving up\" something for her. A trip is something both probably enjoy, so if anything he's donig one thing he likes instead of another thing he likes. Assuming he enjoys travelling and doesn't just tag along to stop her nagging ofc.\n\n \nAnd from what OP shared, their trips seem to happen  less often than tarkov wipes, so there's that to consider", "maybe consider that your wife didn't have to give anything up because she didn't dedicate an unhealthy amount of time to anything in the first place- or didn't do so to the detriment of your time together\n\nthen you follow it up with a gross comment objectifying her as punishment for- wanting to spend more time with you? \n\nthis is why men get \"blindsided\" by divorce", "Uh-huh.\n\nSure.\n\nIt's an entire season and you can plan around it because it's the same every year.\n\nNow did you cancel your skiing plans for your fianc\u00e9 or just not make any?", "My wife\u2019s that way. I don\u2019t like traveling. I go with her when she wants to go though because I care. I wonder what their bed life is like. I know for me the knowledge that things will probably get wild often helped convince me to give up my stuff to do hers.", "ah, only spend time with your wife because sex. does she know you only see her as an object and has simply resigned herself to it?", "A compromise, you say? Smart move. Maybe you should talk to OP's BF then, might even teach the dude a thing or two."]}
