We had to pause because he got a last minute work call and when he came back in I wanted to show him sometime on my phone. We had already started playing the show, so I paused it again. Before I had a chance to show him my phone, he says \u201cWhat the fuck did you do?\u201d In a very harsh tone in regards to the show play time. It had reverted back to the beginning. \n\nWe talk about how other couples address each other inappropriately quite often and how we love that our relationship is so kind, so I was immediately taken aback and shut down. I said something like, \u201cwe\u2019ll fix it in a second\u201d but he insisted that we fix the play time that moment. So I immediately greyrocked and said \u201cokay nevermind, let\u2019s just play the show.\u201d \n\nHe then apologizes, asks to see what I wanted to show him, and cuddles up next to me. I was so turned off and repeatedly said just play it. He then goes in our room and says \u201cI\u2019m not dealing with this right now.\u201d \n\nHe comes in like 20 minutes later to talk about it, says that he\u2019s sorry, and wants to see what I wanted to show him. I was still not interested in talking but expressed my feelings. He then says that he just finished the episode without me. \n\nI\u2019ve been giving him silent treatment all night and I know that\u2019s not mature of me, but I\u2019m just so frustrated. I refuse to be spoken to in that way and I feel like I want him to know that it\u2019s not okay with me.

Fuck. \n\nOP, you are right to feel like you don't deserve to be spoken to that way, those feelings are valid and you're not an asshole for having your feelings hurt by that.   \nYour boyfriend probably has his side to things too and maybe was very stressed out by that work call, and unfairly lashed out because of that.   \n\n\nThe take-away here, which it has taken my wife and I several years to get better at, is that sometimes being \"kind\" is actually being slightly or lovingly dishonest and a bit of brutal honesty spoken out of love would be better. I'm not saying it's okay to be harsh towards your partner, but sometimes saying \"Babe, I'm really tired from work and I just want to watch this show and veg, please\" is the way.   \n\n\nConversely, \"Hey your harsh tone really hurt my feelings, what's going on, is something bothering you?\" And if he says he doesn't want to talk about it right now, respect that and give him space.   \n\n\nSilent treatment (in fact any kind of withholding technique, be it speaking or affection or intimacy) will only ever build resentment, it will never get you the results you want.", "INFO: Were you giving the silent treatment because you were so upset, you couldn't clearly find the right way to communicate/ didn't think you could communicate healthfully?

He: 1) overreacted to the show reverting to the beginning, 2) cursed at you, and 3) insisted you fix the play time immediately before showing him what was important to you. \n\nWas his first apology insincere? Why are you still angry (I'm not saying you might not have a reason to be)? You wrote you expressed your feelings. How?

I don't want to offend you by saying so, but you are at the age where you are developing your relationship communication skills. It's natural for you both to make mistakes. \n\nSure in hindsight it's easy for other people to say that you made mistakes, but trust me, relationship communication is a journey that will last the rest of your lives. \n\nNext time, a better way to deal with it would be, \"I accept your apology, but I'm emotional right now and can't work through it in a healthy manner till I process this. I love you but I need some space.\"", "ESH. His yelling at you was completely inappropriate and uncalled for. Giving someone the silent treatment is manipulative.

Y'all need to work on communicating better and how to respect each other.  Red flags here.", "ESH. Or rather you both handled this poorly. Every single relationship goes through bumps. What matters is how it\u2019s handled after and how you move forward. The good news is this is an opportunity. This is an opportunity for you both to have a discussion and learn to express yourselves in a way that promotes communication. Reacting by shutting down or giving the silent treatment is not helping anything. Reacting by saying something hurtful out of anger doesn\u2019t help anything.

When my kids were little, they would throw tantrums for an hour and then want to immediately switch to being happy and joking around with me. I eventually got pretty good at explaining that I am just not emotionally labile in that way. I cannot go from being screamed at to joking 2 minutes later. I explained that I was not mad, I just needed some time to reset. \n\nI feel like maybe that's what you're needing here. I would recommend trying to frame it that way to him. Let him know that you are not being quiet out of spite, but because his words hurt you, and you will just need time to recover. This is true even if he apologizes and you forgive him. That doesn't magically make your emotional state suddenly ok.", "ESH.  This post could be a lesson in how not to communicate, handle frustrations or sort out miscommunications.", "Is your boyfriend impulsive or quick to anger in general? Had you ever heard him swear at you before? If this is new and frightening behavior, you may need to be concerned that the sweet facade is coming down now that you are comfortable in your relationship.\n\nIf he is prone to throwing the f-word around (and you are more upset that he directed it towards you) take a breath. Behaviors aren\u2019t changed in a day. Consider that your \u201cgreyrock\u201d response is no more evolved than his unless you were in fear that he might follow up with violence. In that case, leaving the room would also make sense.\n\nResponding to his immediate apology by repeatedly saying \u201cjust play it,\u201d instead of simply telling him you need some time is pretty immature. You have the right to process on your own time, but if you care about someone, it\u2019s fair so say as much. Clearly, you needed more than the twenty minutes he gave himself to calm down before you talking it over with him. Again, it would have been better to just tell him you needed more time.\n\nYour ability to cope with frustration will not improve by  shutting down. Take all the time you need, but have that conversation. Playing the silent treatment may only make your negative emotions fester and will not help you heal your wound.", "If you're already using Greyrock on your partner because he regularly talks to you unkindly and punishes you than this relationship sounds incredibly unhealthy. NTA", "ESH, but honey, no.\n\nWhy are you with someone who talks to you that way? Grey rocking is a technique for dealing with narcissists and abusers, not your partner. The fact you feel the need to shut down like this with him is not a good sign. The fact he stormed off and watched the episode without you is just a jerk move.\n\nAnd you doing the silent treatment is also bad. This is not how adults communicate, and it is not a fair way to treat your partner. It is also not teaching him that you won't put up with being spoken to that way - a thing you should, by all means, make clear - it is teaching him that the price of treating you that way is you pouting. \n\nHave an actual conversation, consider therapy to work on your communication (both individually and potentially as a couple), and reassess if there are other signs of trouble in this relationship. This is a snarl of unacceptable behavior and communication failures cascading on top of each other.", "I'm going NTA. He was really unnecessarily unpleasant to you, and even with an apology I can see how you're still kind of pissed off about it.", "NTA. He doesn't sound like the one for you if he's speaking to you in sharp harsh tones. Especially if you've had previous conversations about how gross that is when other couples do it. I also don't think this was the \"silent treatment\" I think he bit your head off over nothing, got embarrassed & tried to put the blame of the situation on your very reasonable reaction to getting snapped at. (Disengaging) NTA he can't snap at people then get booty hurt the person isn't receptive to affection right after.", "ESH. He shouldn\u2019t have spoken to you like that. You should be more mature than resorting to the silent treatment.\n\nWhat exactly will the silent treatment accomplish? Prolonging the conflict instead of resolving it. He behaved unacceptably but then tried to talk and apologize\u2026you opted to make it worse on purpose.", "ESH - He obviously is mostly in the wrong here, but the \"silent treatment\" is childish and accomplishes very little.\n\n\"I'm too upset to talk about this right now and want to be alone.  We'll discuss it later\"", "ESH- but it\u2019s really more on you than him. It\u2019s not okay he talked to you that way, but when you live with someone at some point people do things you don\u2019t like. It happens. You have bad days or moments.\n\nYou have to be able to talk them through and allow someone to apologize, otherwise you never learn or move forward.

Then you got mad at him again, but honestly walking away and doing your own thing is the right thing to do in the situation you presented him with when you wouldn\u2019t allow him to apologize but also made it clear you were upset.\n\nNext time allow him to apologize and talk through what happened.", "ESH", "Esh - he accidentally did something toxic.

What he said was rude and not the way couples should speak to each other. However, he apologized to you very quickly after he said it AND he gave you 20 minutes to cool off and then apologized again. Giving him the silent treatment is incredibly immature and not the way healthy couples communicate. It sounds like he already knows what he did was wrong, but if you\u2019re still unsure if he gets it then you need to actually communicate with him. Giving the silent treatment prolongs the argument and honestly accomplishes nothing good. You may not have started this argument - but you\u2019re absolutely continuing it at this point.", "ESH.

Maybe something on the work call stressed him out and when he came back he snapped at you in frustration. That\u2019s life. He apologised. If it was so out of character for him, instead of ignoring his attempts to apologise all evening why not ask him what he gotten into him that made him react that way. Maybe something else that had nothing to do with you was on his mind. Being in a relationship means sometimes you\u2019re occasionally closest person to take frustration out on.

You cant be mean to a person then get mad all over again that the person is upset over it.", "\"priority\" LOL its just a show... If he can pause it, so can she.", "That's why ESH, him for starting it by being an ass, and her for deciding the best way to handle being upset was the silent treatment.", "Yeah you can keep saying the same thing without considering other factors, it doesn\u2019t change that showing someone something on your phone during a show is rude. Answering a work call can be mandatory lol. I guess this is different for you if you don\u2019t need money. and i guess its a personal preference if you don\u2019t mind someone interrupting your show for silly things but to many people thats annoying behavior.", "I don't speak to people who verbally attack me for no reason. That's literally abuse. It's not bad to not talk to someone after they attacked you. He then got mad at her all over again over being upset that he freaked out on her. So he can snap at people then DEMAND the issue is over because he said sorry? She has to snuggle him & watch tv & talk to him because he's over it? Nope. That's insane.", "Have you ever actually been abused? Physically, verbally or emotionally? I have. By making inane statements such as this you minimize real abuse, which in turn makes people not take people who suffer LITERAL abuse seriously\u2026because in their mind they\u2019re thinking of the guy on Reddit who snapped at his girlfriend.", "Yep that's how I know his behavior is abusive. You're not competing in the DV Olympics. You're not less of a dv survivor because your abuse was different. To say someone else wasn't abused because you got hit is fucked up."]}
