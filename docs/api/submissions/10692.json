Just as I'm getting everything ready, she decides to tell my wife and I about a tik tok she saw last week about how to prevent things from sticking to a stainless steel pan. Apparently if you toss a few drops of water and they dance around for more than a few seconds, it's NOT hot enough. I humor her and decide to step aside since she was so keen on taking over.\n\nFast forward 10 minutes later with the heat as high as can be and the water is STILL dancing. Heat vapor is visibly coming off the pan. I swear to you, the pan has never been hotter! I keep my mouth shut.\n\nFinally she decides it's \"probably\" hot enough and proceeds to POUR oil into the pan. As I expected, almost instantly, the pan is an absolute inferno. Flames are shooting up engulfing our microwave and edging towards our cabinets. My wife screams and runs into our garage to get a fire extinguisher. It took her about 20-30 seconds to find it and by the time she runs back into the door, the oil has burnt itself out.\n\nMy wife and friend are in shock and I'm just sitting there trying not to lose my cool. Our microwave handle is melted and the bottom of the microwave has clear damage and melting around it as well. It might still work, but I wouldn't even be comfortable trying.\n\nI was visibly upset and told her she'll have to pay half the cost for us to replace the microwave (I should have said the full cost...) I also said that she should have just let me cook the meal as I had planned instead of forcefully taking over. She said she just wanted to teach me something (of course) and that it was a total accident that she shouldn't have to pay for. When she said that, I calmed myself down since I knew I wouldn't be able to reason with her. I told her that my wife and I would chat about it and we can talk about it tomorrow.\n\nNot sure where to go from here...my wife is stuck in the middle and not sure if we should expect her to help pay for the damage or just move on and call it an accident.

I can understand her not feeling wholly responsible since it was an accident/unintentional (the drop thing actually works but she obviously wasn't doing it right, the loan has to be empty and dry and you need to focus a few DROPS, as in the size of individual raindrops, for it to work).\n\nAnyways, I digress. My point is that while I personally would offer to pay, some people don't feel as responsible when it's an accidental.

Would it be hard for her to pay for the microwave?\n\nI'm assuming there is more damage (burn marks on your furniture/cabinet and such. Are you planning on doing the repairs yourself? If you are, one option could be to have her help or do them herself (clearing the damage and repainting the cabinet). That way she takes some responsibility for what she did and it's cheaper for her if money is an issue (your choice whether she pays for the paint, etc.) This could be a good compromise so your wife doesn't suffer too much from being in the middle.\n\nBut talk to your wife.
