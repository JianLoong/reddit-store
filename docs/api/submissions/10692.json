I tend to keep my distance from my wife's friend because she's the type of person who tends to have a strong opinion and knowledge about EVERYTHING. She's a great person, but my reserved personality doesn't tend to mesh well with her fiery Italian persona (yes, pun intended).\n\nAnyway, last night we were cooking dinner and were going to fry some salmon on our stainless steel pan. Just as I'm getting everything ready, she decides to tell my wife and I about a tik tok she saw last week about how to prevent things from sticking to a stainless steel pan. Apparently if you toss a few drops of water and they dance around for more than a few seconds, it's NOT hot enough. I humor her and decide to step aside since she was so keen on taking over.\n\nFast forward 10 minutes later with the heat as high as can be and the water is STILL dancing. Heat vapor is visibly coming off the pan. I swear to you, the pan has never been hotter! I keep my mouth shut.\n\nFinally she decides it's \"probably\" hot enough and proceeds to POUR oil into the pan. As I expected, almost instantly, the pan is an absolute inferno. Flames are shooting up engulfing our microwave and edging towards our cabinets. My wife screams and runs into our garage to get a fire extinguisher. It took her about 20-30 seconds to find it and by the time she runs back into the door, the oil has burnt itself out.\n\nMy wife and friend are in shock and I'm just sitting there trying not to lose my cool. Our microwave handle is melted and the bottom of the microwave has clear damage and melting around it as well. It might still work, but I wouldn't even be comfortable trying.\n\nI was visibly upset and told her she'll have to pay half the cost for us to replace the microwave (I should have said the full cost...) I also said that she should have just let me cook the meal as I had planned instead of forcefully taking over. She said she just wanted to teach me something (of course) and that it was a total accident that she shouldn't have to pay for. When she said that, I calmed myself down since I knew I wouldn't be able to reason with her. I told her that my wife and I would chat about it and we can talk about it tomorrow.\n\nNot sure where to go from here...my wife is stuck in the middle and not sure if we should expect her to help pay for the damage or just move on and call it an accident.

Her friend caused an actual fire!!

NTA", "NTA. People are still responsible for the \"accidents\" that they cause.", "NTA. She should had offered to pay immediately after this. I get you were trying to teach her a lesson but you may have to ride this out with your wife for awhile.", "If I had damaged someone else's property I would definitely offer to pay the full amount. Accidents happen but you have to take responsibility for your actions. NTA, get her to pay.", "Either she pays, or banish her from the house. \n\nNTA", "NTA. It was her mistake - IMO she should have offered to pay for it before you even had to ask. \n\nAlso, for anyone wondering, the water dancing thing works but it\u2019s not \u201cfor more than a few seconds\u201d. If your water is dancing at all, your pan is hot enough", "NTA. If I burned my best friend's microwave in that scenario, I would automatically pay for it 100% without being asked. NTA for asking her to pay for it.  However, it should be up to your wife to decide. This is her friend and this could ruin their friendship.", "Nta.... She really shouldn't be trying out things she saw on Tik Tok if she doesn't know or understand how the fuck they work either. Sure, it was an accident, but that's all the more reason for WHY she should pay for the damages. Especially since she's already a grown woman.", "This was NOT an accident. An accident is when something **unforeseen** happens.  \n\nThis fire started because oil was poured into a pan that was hot enough to ignite the oil on contact!  Your wife\u2019s friend *intentionally* heated the pan, and then *intentionally* added the oil. The fire was the direct result of her actions. \n\nTell wife\u2019s friend your offer for 50% of damages has expired. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Girls' not coming back to my kitchen. Probably would have her pay a buck for every time she mentioned tiktok in a sentence, though. Microwave is gonna be fine as long as There's only outside damage btw, don't worry about that.", "ESH. You break, you buy. She decided to follow advice from TikTok and has now learned the price. She should definitely contribute to paying for the damages. \n\nBut you kept your mouth shut when you knew the pan was getting too hot. She didn\u2019t \u201cforcefully take over\u201d \u2014 she told you and your wife about something on TikTok, and you *willingly* stepped aside. Your silence contributed to the fire as well.", "NTA \nEven as an accident she should still contribute. No one told her she did it on purpose so that shouldn't have even been a rebuttal from her. I can't imagine causing damage like that to someone else's property and not immediately offering to cover the expenses. Even if I didn't have the money I would be figuring out how to get it.", "That wasn't an accident. \n\nDude, you 100% watched her do this so she would f up and you could play I told you so because you're tired of her running her mouth about everything. \n\nI think she should pay all of it personally but go with half because you were watching this the entire time. \n\nKind of ESH.", "I was leaning E S H but in reality, YTA. Your humoring her was the equivalent of fuck around and find out. In this case, it literally blew up in your kitchen. You kept your mouth shut, despite the pan being so hot you could see the heat radiating off of it and knowing that it would burst into an inferno once the oil was added. \n\nThen, you took no action in any way to put the flames out. Such as putting the lid on the pan, or smothering it with baking soda or salt ( something you had 10 minutes to prepare, as you knew the likely outcome). Instead you stood by while your wife had to retrieve the fire extinguisher from the garage. That 20-30 seconds could make the difference between having a home or a pile of smothering ashes. \n\nAt the end of the day, you were willing to risk burning your entire house down to prove a point. Be glad you only need to buy a new microwave. \n\nAlso, you should have a fire extinguisher in any room where there is a fire risk, even if it is just a candle. \n\nHopefully both you, your wife and the BFF walk away having learned a valuable lesson.", "ESH.\n\nYour wife's friend is an idiot who shouldn't test obviously dangerous TikTok Hacks in someone else's kitchen if she doesn't actually know what she's doing, or what the actual video was about.\n\n> I kept my mouth shut\n\nYou had what sounds like a clear opportunity to avoid this but chose to let her fail, and your microwave paid the price.\n\nAsking her to reimburse some of the damage isn't unreasonable, but maybe waiting until you have an actual dollar amount of the damage would've been more tactful.", "Isn't the oil supposed to be what keeps the food from sticking to the pan...?\n\nESH\n\nShe shouldn't be trying out tik tok trends in your kitchen and should at least offer you some form of payment in apology. But you also could have stopped her at any time, or prevented her from trying at all, so you're definitely at fault too.\n\n\"As I expected\" \n\nYou knew the pan was hot, and you let her pour the oil in... You both are to blame for the fire.", "NTA. She did something stupid in your house, and she caused damage. Of course she needs to pay to fix it", "YTA, I think you should move on.\n\nIf you fully expected the pan would go up in flames and cause damage, and she seemed unaware about what would happen, you're at fault for standing idly by. She didn't forcibly take over, you let her go through with the demonstration. If you really didn't want an accident to happen, you could have stepped in.  \n\nYou seem more passive aggressive than reserved.", "NAH. She burned your microwave trying to teach you a life hack from TikTok. Her educational intent is nice, but the fact that she was pretty obviously and deeply wrong mutes the educational value somewhat. Her choice to try an experiment with obvious consequences in your kitchen is suspect. \n\nAt the same time, you let her do this. Presumably, you didn\u2019t establish any liability terms before she got to the stove. This is why equipment rental places make you sign those long agreements. Because reasonable people can disagree about whether, has she borrowed your car, she\u2019d be responsible for the damage it received in an accident. \n\nYour position is reasonable. Her position, that you should have stopped her if you didn\u2019t think what she was doing was acceptable in your kitchen, and if it\u2019s on TikTok it must be true, is also reasonable (that last part is obviously suspect, but clearly, reasonable (or at least numerous) people hold this position.", "ESH all three of y\u2019all are old enough to know better,   You heated a pan to the flash point of the oil and then poured oil into it. Water boils at 212 and what you\u2019re describing as dancing across the pan is called Leidenfrost point about 380 degrees   It depends on the oil but most cooking oil flash point is around 600   \n\nOn a side note buy a kitchen extinguisher", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I can understand her not feeling wholly responsible since it was an accident/unintentional (the drop thing actually works but she obviously wasn't doing it right, the loan has to be empty and dry and you need to focus a few DROPS, as in the size of individual raindrops, for it to work).\n\nAnyways, I digress. My point is that while I personally would offer to pay, some people don't feel as responsible when it's an accidental. And since you immediately DEMANDED payment, it's possible she reached by pushing back HARD (I ask in no way blaming you for her reaction, just pointing out a possible explanation for it since sometimes the stronger the stance, the stronger done people resist.\n\nAlso, how is she financially? Would it be hard for her to pay for the microwave?\n\nI'm assuming there is more damage (burn marks on your furniture/cabinet and such. Are you planning on doing the repairs yourself? If you are, one option could be to have her help or do them herself (clearing the damage and repainting the cabinet). That way she takes some responsibility for what she did and it's cheaper for her if money is an issue (your choice whether she pays for the paint, etc.) This could be a good compromise so your wife doesn't suffer too much from being in the middle.\n\nBut talk to your wife. See how she feels, listen to what she wants.\n\nBut if you don't end up charging her in any way (either money or labor), discuss some rules or guidelines for the future", "It wasn't on Tik Tok, so she didn't think she had to /s", "Same! I'd have been so embarrassed that I'd blurt it out straight away \"I'll pay\" and be on mu sper best behaviour!!!! She could've burned the whole house down!", "How is this OP's fault?

The friendship lawyer? Do you have people signing liability contracts anytime they cross your property line? Op is NTA and more than justified to bar the woman from his house over this.

I'd have done the same, in fact, I'd have been butting heads with someone like her, if they came to my house and tried to get me to do things their way.\n\nBut OP states that he's more passive, so maybe he expected to teach her a lesson by letting her fail. Even if so, she's still the AH bcs everyone can see when a pan is red hot and even if you don't cook often, you know NOT to throw oil on a hot pan!", "He probably assumed, like I did while reading this, that she was just going to burn the shit out of the fish not start a grease fire.
