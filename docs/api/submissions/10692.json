She's a great person, but my reserved personality doesn't tend to mesh well with her fiery Italian persona (yes, pun intended).\n\nAnyway, last night we were cooking dinner and were going to fry some salmon on our stainless steel pan. Just as I'm getting everything ready, she decides to tell my wife and I about a tik tok she saw last week about how to prevent things from sticking to a stainless steel pan. Apparently if you toss a few drops of water and they dance around for more than a few seconds, it's NOT hot enough. I humor her and decide to step aside since she was so keen on taking over.\n\nFast forward 10 minutes later with the heat as high as can be and the water is STILL dancing. Heat vapor is visibly coming off the pan. I swear to you, the pan has never been hotter! I keep my mouth shut.\n\nFinally she decides it's \"probably\" hot enough and proceeds to POUR oil into the pan. As I expected, almost instantly, the pan is an absolute inferno. Flames are shooting up engulfing our microwave and edging towards our cabinets. My wife screams and runs into our garage to get a fire extinguisher. It took her about 20-30 seconds to find it and by the time she runs back into the door, the oil has burnt itself out.\n\nMy wife and friend are in shock and I'm just sitting there trying not to lose my cool. Our microwave handle is melted and the bottom of the microwave has clear damage and melting around it as well. It might still work, but I wouldn't even be comfortable trying.\n\nI was visibly upset and told her she'll have to pay half the cost for us to replace the microwave (I should have said the full cost...) I also said that she should have just let me cook the meal as I had planned instead of forcefully taking over. She said she just wanted to teach me something (of course) and that it was a total accident that she shouldn't have to pay for. When she said that, I calmed myself down since I knew I wouldn't be able to reason with her. I told her that my wife and I would chat about it and we can talk about it tomorrow.\n\nNot sure where to go from here...my wife is stuck in the middle and not sure if we should expect her to help pay for the damage or just move on and call it an accident.

I can understand her not feeling wholly responsible since it was an accident/unintentional (the drop thing actually works but she obviously wasn't doing it right, the loan has to be empty and dry and you need to focus a few DROPS, as in the size of individual raindrops, for it to work).\n\nAnyways, I digress. My point is that while I personally would offer to pay, some people don't feel as responsible when it's an accidental.

If you are, one option could be to have her help or do them herself (clearing the damage and repainting the cabinet).

The ONLY reason I say you\u2019re slightly at fault is for the \u201cI kept my mouth shut\u201d comment. You KNEW it wasn\u2019t safe, but you let her do it anyway. She should still help pay for it, but you also should have spoken up. This could have been prevented.", "ESH. Obviously she is TA for causing the fire and not offering to pay for anything damaged. But you're also TA for not having a fire extinguisher in the kitchen like under the sink and having to take an extra 20-30 seconds to go into the garage to find one. If you had a fire extinguisher under the sink where it belongs in a kitchen, there likely would have been no damage.", "Yup", "Yeah I don\u2019t get where claiming something is an accident means you have no responsibility. Al it means was you didn\u2019t do it intentionally and people are more inclined to forgive you.", "Exactly.", "> There are probably YouTube videos explaining it\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5XcN3AyITY", "And tell her to stop getting cooking tips from TikTok", "I agree. He knew what would happen, why did he allow her to continue??", "Agree. ESH", "This. It sounds like they expected the outcome and sat back and watched. ESH.", "Are you kidding!? Found the person who goes to people's houses and destroys things!! NTA, OP.", "I think half is fair considering he admits that he willingly stood by silently even though he could tell the pan was too hot and that it would ignite the oil.", "So, the most obvious answer is to make a TikTok saying that those who cause fires in their friends houses have to pay full repair costs. It's only *the* hottest trend!", "People can have parties for whatever reason they want, providing it\u2019s not harming anyone else. It\u2019s complete nonsense to call them an AH just for that.", "It's not that out there, Tik Tok is full of millenials tbh.", "They're stupid.\n\nIf I go to the park and want to use the slide or the swings I can't because the parents are evil and shoo me away. TikTok, after reaching adulthood, is just for kids. Give it up.", "You sound miserable. Not all of us have a stick in our a**.", "You can say ass here, asshole.\n\nI just like playing on the swings and don't like parents.", "Yeah man, I\u2019m sure whatever inane bullshit you\u2019re up to in your free time is far more noble than tiktok. Get over yourself.", "Get a library card."]}
