She's a great person, but my reserved personality doesn't tend to mesh well with her fiery Italian persona (yes, pun intended).\n\nAnyway, last night we were cooking dinner and were going to fry some salmon on our stainless steel pan. Just as I'm getting everything ready, she decides to tell my wife and I about a tik tok she saw last week about how to prevent things from sticking to a stainless steel pan. Apparently if you toss a few drops of water and they dance around for more than a few seconds, it's NOT hot enough. I humor her and decide to step aside since she was so keen on taking over.\n\nFast forward 10 minutes later with the heat as high as can be and the water is STILL dancing. Heat vapor is visibly coming off the pan. I swear to you, the pan has never been hotter! I keep my mouth shut.\n\nFinally she decides it's \"probably\" hot enough and proceeds to POUR oil into the pan. As I expected, almost instantly, the pan is an absolute inferno. Flames are shooting up engulfing our microwave and edging towards our cabinets. My wife screams and runs into our garage to get a fire extinguisher. It took her about 20-30 seconds to find it and by the time she runs back into the door, the oil has burnt itself out.\n\nMy wife and friend are in shock and I'm just sitting there trying not to lose my cool. Our microwave handle is melted and the bottom of the microwave has clear damage and melting around it as well. It might still work, but I wouldn't even be comfortable trying.\n\nI was visibly upset and told her she'll have to pay half the cost for us to replace the microwave (I should have said the full cost...) I also said that she should have just let me cook the meal as I had planned instead of forcefully taking over. She said she just wanted to teach me something (of course) and that it was a total accident that she shouldn't have to pay for. When she said that, I calmed myself down since I knew I wouldn't be able to reason with her. I told her that my wife and I would chat about it and we can talk about it tomorrow.\n\nNot sure where to go from here...my wife is stuck in the middle and not sure if we should expect her to help pay for the damage or just move on and call it an accident.

I can understand her not feeling wholly responsible since it was an accident/unintentional (the drop thing actually works but she obviously wasn't doing it right, the loan has to be empty and dry and you need to focus a few DROPS, as in the size of individual raindrops, for it to work).\n\nAnyways, I digress. My point is that while I personally would offer to pay, some people don't feel as responsible when it's an accidental.

If you are, one option could be to have her help or do them herself (clearing the damage and repainting the cabinet).

What if his wife couldn't find the fire extinguisher or it took her even longer to find it?", "They have a point. I mean, she's definitely definitely an asshole but OP did the equivalent of watching someone light a match over the pile of kindling that is their house and did... nothing. It's his property in the end, and him just standing there without attempting to prevent anything makes him an asshole to himself and his wife, especially since he just stood there watching the fire after the fact. If your house was burning, cause be damned, you should try to at least help put it out.", "To be fair, he might mean as expected if you do that vs he expecting her to set the kitchen on fire\n\nLike I am not great at cooking but I know better than to mix water and oil at different temperatures...", "As someone who knows people who are always \"right\" and refuse to listen to anyone else once they \"know\" something, it's exhausting to always try and get them to see sense. So I completely understand just letting them fail and avoiding the argument. Especially when they are just going to do what they want regardless. Why waste the energy?", "Wait, there\u2019s not a prince who wants to give me all his money?", "That's the part where a smart not dumb tiktokite would look at the video and go, ah, this is clearly bullshit. Because what the hell else is water supposed to do on a hot pan? It boils and evaporates. Ta da.", "Sus comment.", "Yeah I don\u2019t get where claiming something is an accident means you have no responsibility.", "Stepping in would mean no fire, no damages, and no risk of anything even worse to have happened. That is a big win. Proving his point by allowing this was equally as stupid as wanting to try it.", "He would've been considered wrong only by this friend who is clearly an idiot, yet he would've prevented damage to his own home. You don't worry about winning with idiots when it comes to protecting your home, you just do it.", "I agree. She NEVER would have stepped away unless he forcibly removed her.  This was going to happen whether OP stopped her or not!!! \n\nNTA\u2026she should pay!!!", "Exactly.  He would have been accused of several things \n(by both friend and wife) including man-splaning, not letting a guest help, trying to take over, not trusting friends kitchen abilities,  etc.", "So if he\u2019d stepped in, there would have been an argument. Because he didn\u2019t, there was a fire. You see how one of these was a better solution than the other? \n\nHe had a duty to mitigate damages he predicted. Because he didn\u2019t, he should split the cost.", "Yep. I personally wouldn't have a gender reveal partly, but I wouldn't police or call anyone who did an AH, unless they're causing fires in California with it. This is just another spinoff of redditors hate anything associated with children trope.", "Most gender reveal parties lead to an explosion, as evidenced by this post /s", "I think they are ridiculous but my daughter wanted one at first so I was going to pay for it, because you know it\u2019s not my baby. But she decided she couldn\u2019t wait and wanted to know right away so she didn\u2019t go through with it. Thankfully she decided this before plans were set!", "To be fair, the friend is helping with the party. The chick that set the kitchen on fire based on a tiktok video.", "im still amazed it was the wife who went running for it when he was straight up predicting the fire, according to his own account.", "Why he decided to call her bluff as a \u201cknow it all\u201d over hot oil, with his expecting wife present, is beyond me. Surely if she\u2019s so bad at this, he could have called her out with a simple Google in front of others at another time. Public shame is a fine tool.", "I think that\u2019s a fine approach if you think what the person is doing is wrong or silly. My calculation on that changes when they\u2019re doing something actively dangerous. OP is lucky it\u2019s just the kitchen fixtures that were damaged and no one was actually injured.", "You \u201cwaste the energy\u201d because you don\u2019t want your house to catch fire. It doesn\u2019t matter how exhausting it is, you do what you need to do to save your damn house. OP EXPECTED this to happen.", "I WISH. I could also use some of that prince\u2019s money.", "What else did they expect - the pan to get so hot that the water evapourates *before* it touches the surface of the pan?\n\nAlso do you really add oil after the pan is \"hot enough\"? Or heat the pan with oil until it's hot enough? Plus, of course, \"hot enough\" is a feature of the oil - olive oil would be ruined and butter would be charred at a temperature that's perfectly fine for grapeseed oil.", "What they are describing is water dancing due to the Leidenfrost effect, a signal the pan is hot and not just warm. If the pan is sub \\~400F/200C it won't dance around because there isn't a thin layer of vapor keeping the water bubble floating. Under that water just sits and then evaporates if above 212F/100C. \n\nWhat the wife's friend didn't know is that the Leidenfrost effect has a lower boundary, but no upper boundary. I'm sure she got the pan hot af because auto-ignition of oils doesn't happen until [380C/700F](https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/11333) which means that pan  was scorching hot.", "Yeah I call bot. On here a month and all comments within an hour.", "Yeah exactly. If he had told her this was a bad idea and she proceeded anyway, I would say N T A, but that's not the case. He let her try something that caused a fire with his pregnant wife standing right there... that's dangerous. Prove your point on something where there is no risk of burning down your home. It's really ESH.", "He probably was just expecting she would only put a small amount that would immediately burn up on the pan. Not that she would set their kitchen on fire, or even the oil at all.", "I guarantee you her and the wife would have just done it anyway while screeching how controlling he is.", "And then he would be the monster for touching her. As much as people on this sub want to deny it there are situations where there is absolutely no winning as a man. You are wrong for stepping in, wrong for letting it happen, and it's your fault they had the idea to even begin with.", "Yep! Despite the delusions you see around here there are situations where you, as a man, are wrong simply for existing. This is one of them. If he stepped in he's mansplaining, if he physically stopped them from burning down his house he's physically abusive, if he lets them burn down his house it's his fault for not stopping them. It's insanity", "She caused the damage. It's on her. She's an adult. There really isn't anything else to it besides this subs usual desperate attempt to give some of the blame to a man when a woman is undeniably completely at fault.", "Agreed. Any other time that didn't involve fire damage to his house would've been a better time to call her out lol.", "Why do you think it's for kids? I never see kids on my FYP nor do I follow any. I see chefs, comedians, news...", "I am 36 and very much like swings thank you.", "Men definitely do not get a fair shake in certain situations for sure. Same for women!  Especially on this sub. \n\nI honestly thought the gender reveal was going to be the cause of the fire \ud83e\udd23.", "You're forgetting that other chestnut that has shown up again and again here: he didn't have the fire extinguisher primed and ready, so he's worse than Hitler.", "Kids, anyone younger than 25. Make my coffee and shut up, kids!", "Swings are great!  All hail the swing!", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
