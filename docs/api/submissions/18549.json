We all had a good time, but it was obvious Joe and Chloe were having some issues, both with Liam and each other. Nothing serious, just tension, and a few snide remarks about Liam's behaviour and Chloe's appearance from Joe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOver the weekend, we all went out to have lunch and then watch a local event with the intention of attending a party afterwards. It was a long day with three distinct parts to it so I had clothes to change. I changed before lunch and when I came down to lunch, Joe said I looked nice. I said thanks thinking that would be the end of it but he launched into a whole rant - at the table, with everyone there - about how he wished Chloe would make more of an effort with her appearance, how she still had baby weight, never thought about it how she looked or how he felt being out with her, and how since I managed to keep myself \"together\" while having a husband who is never around, it obviously can be done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was incensed. This greasy gnome had insulted 3/5 of the adults, in front of our parents, and the kids. I told Joe, \u201cI married a husband and a father, not an extra child, and he provides support, not excuses. If I was a single parent, with a 9-5 and you to come home to, I wouldn\u2019t look like this. That is a reflection of your failures, not Chloe's.\u201d Joe grumbled that he was only making a point but my stepdad said that everyone needed to calm down and we should just get on with our meal, which we did. Joe stayed away from pretty much everyone for the rest of the afternoon, while Chloe sat with us but was sullen and withdrawn. When I tried to talk to her about what happened she blew up at me, saying I insulted her, and her and Joe's situation with the way I spoke to him. I said I never intended to embarrass her, unlike her husband, and that Joe had insulted me also by turning me into some archaic fantasy. Chloe was still angry and said I had proved his point and made it worse by making her look like she was married to an idiot, and I should have just brushed it off. I gave up trying to talk to her and the rest of the trip was awkward between us. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy parents say I\u2019m not the AH, but my husband says I sort of was. He absolutely supports everything I said, but agrees with Chloe that by defending myself, Chloe became collateral damage. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong because what Joe said was weird and demeaning and it did involve me, it\u2019s not like I gave some unsolicited or untrue response. That said, some of my friends also think I should have just let it go since I wasn\u2019t the most insulted party.", "created_utc": 1685450661, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13vpajt/aita_for_calling_my_bil_a_failure_after_he/", "score": 113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think what you were trying to say is that if you had a husband who did not help and was just a burden, you wouldn't have time for yourself to get your hair done or go to the gym etc, and that Chloe not having that time is evidence of Joe's failure as a husband. \n\nWhat you said, however, could be perceived as, \"Yes, she looks a bloody state, and why wouldn't she when she has a husband like you? Her terrible appearance is a reflection of your shittyness.\"\n\nImagine hearing that when you've already had your husband constantly tearing away at your self-confidence and making you feel terrible. Would you feel like the person speaking was defending you, or would you feel like the person speaking was agreeing that you look awful but that it is your husband's fault? \n\nYou aren't wrong for defending Chloe. If I were you, I'd apologise for the wording, but that you felt you couldn't sit by and let Joe speak to her like that, especially when he was using your appearance as a hammer to hit her with. \n\nPerhaps offer her a girls' day out somewhere so she can get pampered and feel special, and make sure she knows that she's beautiful irrespective of if she still has baby weight; if he's constantly knocking her down, Chloe needs someone to help build her up. If her confidence grows, she might just ditch Joe, but right now she is probably feeling so badly about her appearance that she feels she has to stick around, and she is likely wondering how she ended up with him (her comment about saying she married an idiot is telling. She likely feels bad that she chose that idiot).", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are fine.", "NTA\n\nYou went in to defend your sister and call out disgusting behavior that has obviously not been addressed before. \n\nI admit it may have made things more awkward for her relationship with him as none of us know what he his like behind closed doors. \n\nAt the end of the day, their relationship is theirs to sort out. Hopefully your sister will find the strength to stand for herself. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine that he will try that again with you around though.", "Joe would have been an asshole whether you said something or not. The problem here is that Chloe likes being treated like shit by her husband.", "NTA    you felt you were doing the right thing.

And now she's ashamed, angry, and upset that it's public knowledge. She still has to go home with him and have him talk to her like this everyday. I assume the disagreements on parenting is from husband's lack of effort and over reactions. (When he does get involved it's disproportionate) \n\nYou need to reach out to her again and open the door for her to escape him. In a way you can help from abroad when they go home. Your BiL is much worse behind closed doors and your nephew is going to really start soaking in his actions as he grows. To either mimic or retaliate.", "NTA, your house, your rules. If you\u2019re at someone else\u2019s place let the Neanderthal rant.", "NTA.  Why do people responding to the AH always get blamed and shamed for responding appropriately when someone is offensive?  I don't get it.  Also - if your sister is embarrassed by her situation, that is really not your fault, it is just easier to blame you.", "NTA you defended your sister from her creepy useless husband and she's mad at you. This guy must be making her so insecure she felt it was insulting to her.", "NTA what a mess. With these types of dynamics, I often get to a point where if someone is choosing a messy situation, then fine \u2014 that\u2019s on them, but don\u2019t drag others into that messy situation or subject them to it. Your sister\u2019s anger is misdirected. It\u2019s easier to be angry at you than Joe because 1) there could be immediate consequences for her if she tells him something back and 2) recognizing her anger toward him could cause some deep self reflection about life choices and the dynamic being modeled for their child and that\u2019s a lot to process.\n\n>Chloe was still angry and said I\u2026 made it worse by making her look like she was married to an idiot\n\nWell\u2026", "NTA, and sorry but it sounds like both Chloe and Joe married an idiot.

You\u2019re protecting your sister from her abusive husband\u2026 so of course she and others don\u2019t want to admit to it", "NTA and why is your hubby criticizing you OP? I can understand from your sisters point of view due to her living with this guy that she is supposed to love, yet treats her like poop. It is common for people in that situation where the victim supports or defends the oppressor. Your hubby does not have a leg to stand on. Good for you for standing up for your sister. I hope that she will see that you were supporting her and bringing him down a level or two.", "NTA. Chloe knows very well it's true so she is humiliated and embarrassed but that's her problem because it's her husband's actions that embarrassed her. You're just a target to strike at because she does not want to admit her marriage is in trouble.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong, ''Chloe was still angry and said I had proved his point and made it worse by making her look like she was married to an idiot'' Well, she did indeed marry an idiot.", "NTA- but your husband is correct. True or not, in your wording you literally agreed with her husband about her looks. She lashed out because it was humiliating and hurt her. Did you start it, no. But your wording did give her a backhanded  insult.\nYou had every right to snap back at BIL though.", "NTA Joe makes himself look like an idiot and if she stays with someone cruel enough to say that shit in front of her family she'll be an idiot as well", "Chloe might have been embarrassed in the moment but I guarantee your words will resonate in her head. Well done.", "Going by her response that clearly isn't what she wants. OP should leave her to her own devices.", "It might be easier to get angry at the OP because getting angry at her husband would require her to confront the fact that her partner isn't great and her marriage has some issues.", "I do see how Chloe is a bit upset, obviously it's at the wrong person but I think in saying to Joe that if op had to come home to him she wouldn't look the way she did essentially confirmed, at least in Chloe's perspective, that she does look frumpy or however Joe wants to put it and that might have made her feel bad. Obviously op didn't intend it that way but I'm guessing that is how Chloe saw it on top of being made to feel like she married an idiot. It's easier to be mad at your sister than your husband who thinks so low of you and ruins your self esteem", "This right here.", "Not wanting her husband called out does not mean she enjoys it. Grow a brain. It's very evident that they are having problems, but no one likes being insulted, or treated poorly. You are blaming the victim.", "I found the way he spoke about me as if, firstly, I wasn't there, and second, as I was an object upon which to project his MILF fantasies, very disrespectful and insulting. He's my \\*brother\\* in law, I do not want to, nor should I know what he thinks of my appearance, much less in comparison to his wife who is my family member.", "On the contrary.\n\nThis is very common to abused people. They lash out their anger and frustration at safe targets, because they can't at the cause of their anger.\n\nIt's not on purpose... it's a psychological defense mechanism.\n\nShe needs support and therapy. Not getting more isolated from anyone who can help her... even if she's lashing out.", "Bingo\n\nAnd that she did in fact, marry an idiot", "Except OP is a victim and rightfully called her greasy gnome of a BIL for insulting both victims (her & Chloe) in front of 3 other adults.\n\n\nNTA because he was out-of-line pulling that comparison nonsense and Chloe needs to realize that not everyone is going to sit/stand there allowing someone to dusparage compare like it's positive & praise.", "If that\u2019s how you felt, then that\u2019s what you should have said to defend yourself. Instead, you kept the comparison going by telling him that his wife could look as good as you if he were a better husband.", "I\u2019m laughing at \u201cgreasy gnome of a BIL\u201d. That\u2019s perfect.", "OP's not wrong calling her BIL a greasy gnome for insulting his wife and using OP as a comparison then assuming would completely agree with his negging while realizing he inadvertently shitted on his SIL/OP too."]}
