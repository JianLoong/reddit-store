I said thanks thinking that would be the end of it but he launched into a whole rant - at the table, with everyone there - about how he wished Chloe would make more of an effort with her appearance, how she still had baby weight, never thought about it how she looked or how he felt being out with her, and how since I managed to keep myself \"together\" while having a husband who is never around, it obviously can be done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was incensed.

If her confidence grows, she might just ditch Joe, but right now she is probably feeling so badly about her appearance that she feels she has to stick around, and she is likely wondering how she ended up with him (her comment about saying she married an idiot is telling.

With these types of dynamics, I often get to a point where if someone is choosing a messy situation, then fine \u2014 that\u2019s on them, but don\u2019t drag others into that messy situation or subject them to it. Your sister\u2019s anger is misdirected. It\u2019s easier to be angry at you than Joe because 1) there could be immediate consequences for her if she tells him something back and 2) recognizing her anger toward him could cause some deep self reflection about life choices and the dynamic being modeled for their child and that\u2019s a lot to process.\n\n>Chloe was still angry and said I\u2026 made it worse by making her look like she was married to an idiot\n\nWell\u2026", "NTA, and sorry but it sounds like both Chloe and Joe married an idiot.

Obviously op didn't intend it that way but I'm guessing that is how Chloe saw it on top of being made to feel like she married an idiot.

That's all that your sister is concerned about. So you pointing out the reason why, doesn't make her feel better. If her husband is as big of an asshole as I believe...then he'll just use what you said against her later behind closed doors.\n\nThe only way that you could win in this situation was if your sister wasn't her own worst enemy. She cares more about how her husband and everyone else sees her. \n\nTruth be told, if you had remained silent and just accepted what he said...your sister would still turn her anger towards you instead of him, because she'd see you as her competition.", "NTA.

I looked great!  This really did my head in! It took me years to get over the damage he did to my self-esteem.\n\nYep, Chloe is sad and she should be, but not because of you.

BIL is definitely a complete AH, and your other family members aren't coming off great because they didn't stick up for Chloe at all.

What is he talking about!\"  To everyone but him, subtly excluding him to piss him off while your actual words are innocent and hard to fault.  And then your Mom or someone else at the table should have said, \"I think Chloe looks great!\"  Establishing a united front (hindsight being 20/20).  But you're not a trained diplomat.

When BIL said Chloe's fat and doesn't take care of her appearance so imagine how it feels being seen in public with her, OP said \"Yeah! That's cuz I have a decent hubby here. If I had you to come home to, I'd look like crap too.\"", ">In defending herself OP ~~inadvertently~~ willingly confirmed the asshole comments\n\n\nFixed it. OP knew what she was doing.", "I couldn\u2019t say this any better, so . . . *ditto.* NTA.", "Or maybe it's because OP didn't at all dispute that Chloe looks like crap, just explained that she herself looks good because she's got a good husband. \n\nThat would sting a little, I'd think.", "[removed]", "NTA I mean she married a misogynistic asshole. That\u2019s obviously bad for her, but doesn\u2019t mean you have to take insults from him just to keep her in her fantasy.", " ESH. It wasn\u2019t your intention, but you very obviously belittled and embarrassed her for choosing that man as her husband.", ">Chloe was still angry and said I had proved his point and made it worse by making her look like she was married to an idiot,\n\nBut she is married to an idiot.... I doubt anyone around  them is under any other impression.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, could you have instead defended your sister and made him feel like an AH? Yes\u2014that would have probably been the approach more would have deemed appropriate. But you act in the moment, he did it to himself. It\u2019s unlikely your sister is actually angry at you if you had a good relationship, she likely lashed at you because she felt she couldn\u2019t at her husband.", "NTA your sister married and idiot and it hurt her, because you agreed.", "NTA. Except you, all of the adults in this situation and Chloe herself have failed her.", "ESH.Just because someone's an idiot doesn't mean you need to get involved.and why did you? To help your sis? Do you really think this was the best way to do it?\n\nYes BIL is a major tool. But if you cared about your sis, your goal should be to help her extricate herself from that situation. Throwing insults at BIL and making a scene are not going to help her.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

The husband says that not OP. OP had a go at the husband.\n\nAlso\u2026 I was making a joke that OP had solved her sisters marital problems by making both husband and sister come together to hate her.", "she IS married to an idiot NTA", "NTA.  The truth hurts and your sister already knows she married an idiot.", "NA. Sounds like your sister is in an abusive relationship, and I'm surprised that her dad didn't go apeshit for witnessing it. He's trying to isolate her, pit her against her family and is gaslighting her. It's classic control techniques."]}
