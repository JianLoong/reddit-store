If her confidence grows, she might just ditch Joe, but right now she is probably feeling so badly about her appearance that she feels she has to stick around, and she is likely wondering how she ended up with him (her comment about saying she married an idiot is telling.

With these types of dynamics, I often get to a point where if someone is choosing a messy situation, then fine \u2014 that\u2019s on them, but don\u2019t drag others into that messy situation or subject them to it. Your sister\u2019s anger is misdirected. It\u2019s easier to be angry at you than Joe because 1) there could be immediate consequences for her if she tells him something back and 2) recognizing her anger toward him could cause some deep self reflection about life choices and the dynamic being modeled for their child and that\u2019s a lot to process.\n\n>Chloe was still angry and said I\u2026 made it worse by making her look like she was married to an idiot\n\nWell\u2026", "NTA, and sorry but it sounds like both Chloe and Joe married an idiot.

Obviously op didn't intend it that way but I'm guessing that is how Chloe saw it on top of being made to feel like she married an idiot. It's easier to be mad at your sister than your husband who thinks so low of you and ruins your self esteem", "This right here.", "Not wanting her husband called out does not mean she enjoys it.

That's all that your sister is concerned about. So you pointing out the reason why, doesn't make her feel better. If her husband is as big of an asshole as I believe...then he'll just use what you said against her later behind closed doors.\n\nThe only way that you could win in this situation was if your sister wasn't her own worst enemy. She cares more about how her husband and everyone else sees her. \n\nTruth be told, if you had remained silent and just accepted what he said...your sister would still turn her anger towards you instead of him, because she'd see you as her competition.", "NTA.

I was married before for 7 years with no kids.  That guy nagged me about my weight, my figure and my clothing constantly.  I look back at pix and can't figure out what he didn't like!  I looked great!  This really did my head in! It took me years to get over the damage he did to my self-esteem.\n\nYep, Chloe is sad and she should be, but not because of you.

For future reference, it would have been better to glance around and say something like \"Wow, where did that come from!  Seriously. What is he talking about!\"  To everyone but him, subtly excluding him to piss him off while your actual words are innocent and hard to fault.  And then your Mom or someone else at the table should have said, \"I think Chloe looks great!\"  Establishing a united front (hindsight being 20/20).  But you're not a trained diplomat.

Ugly with a loser husband = Chloe vs. beautiful with a great husband = OP.  Perhaps Chloe has always left like the OP has outshined her in everything.", "u/Suddhgghe is a comment stealing bot. Original by u/Doenut55", "She knows she married an idiot; she may not be ready to admit that.", "If she had stood up for herself in this moment- or ever- then you wouldn't have had to say anything.", "I agree it wouldn\u2019t call op or her sister ah. I think if op were to reach out to her sister and let her that she doesn\u2019t agree with her husband on how she looks after having a child. It would go a long way", "Was going to say this. Sounds like Chloe is worried about receiving backlash when ahe gets home.", "I'm wondering if he is cheating or trying to hit on OP anyway (which can be a form of emotional and financial abuse).  OP needed to shut him down hard like that.", "This. Please don't leave her alone. Just let her know you are there, without judgement, if she ever needs you. It may take a while. A long while. But if it does, it will be a lifeline.", "Seriously. Start commenting on how he has chaged/aged and he will get the point. BIL is the asshole!", "Possibly, but I find it more likely he's trying to shame/devalue Chloe so she's less likely to leave. He's conditioning her to believe she is the failure and can't do better than him so she won't leave/"]}
