My brother and Ruth have been married since the girls (17f currently) were both 6. Ruth's first husband died when Skyler was 5 and Macey's mom chose not to be in her life. Because the girls are the same age my brother and Ruth decided that it would be cute to treat them like twins and Macey loved it while Skyler hated it.\n\nMacey always saw Skyler as her BFF and sister. Skyler doesn't like Macey and I don't think there has ever been a time she has enjoyed spending time with Macey. I'm almost positive she'd love to yeet her from her life entirely. They were always pushed together if Macey expressed an interest or mentioned to her parents that she wanted time with Skyler.\n\nTwo years ago the topic of college was first brought up and a plan was made that the girls would go to the same college if possible and would request to be roommates if successful. The plan was for them to attend college in the same town and live in dorms for Freshman year and the plan was further detailed to say they would rent an apartment together for the other three years. This was to keep them close and to provide extra safety to them, apparently. Skyler was never on board with the plan. I heard her say it, my brother heard her say it, Ruth heard her say it, Macey heard her say it, Ruth's parents and my parents heard her say it, my other brother heard her say it. We all did. But my brother, Ruth and Macey decided to ignore this.\n\nLast month Macey heard Skyler talking to her friends and they were talking about college and she heard them making plans together for college. She also heard Skyler say she'd pick the college furthest from her. Macey was so upset and told her parents and hellfire rained down on their house and Skyler was in trouble for making those plans.\n\nMacey's emotions have been all over the place these last few weeks. She goes from sad to angry and even surprised that Skyler was angry at her for telling her mom. My brother and Ruth were framing it like poor Macey, she's the victim here and I was in shock. I understand her being upset that Skyler doesn't feel the same way but this should not come as a surprise to her. They are acting like Macey is 6 and Skyler bullied her and treated some much younger kid badly. When all she did was try to do her own thing and get some independence. \n\nSo when Macey came to me and complained to me I was a lot harsher than maybe I should be. I told her that Skyler does not owe it to her to follow a plan everyone else made for her and that she needs to learn some people won't like her and she cannot force them. I told her she needs to accept the reality; which is Skyler and her are highly unlikely to go to school together after senior year and she's not going to see her all the time like she wants. Macey was crying by the time I finished.

For over 10 years like WTF ?\n\nI'm pretty sure Skyler will go NC with all of them unless you left things out where skyler also had a good time .For me it sounds like torture for 10 years . 3 against 1 for 10 years wow she had nobody to protect her .\n\nI'm glad she finally can escape\n\nMacey needs help when she can't see that there was no bond or friendship and esp no sisterhood . Who cares that she cries now Skyler cried alone in her bed for years so Macey needs a wake up call", "NTA. Skyler has been forced to be a bff sidekick for years when she clearly did not want to. Your brother, Ruth, and Macey are insane to think this would continue once she\u2019s a legal adult who can get the hell away from them. You should really sit and talk with your brother and Ruth because eventually she\u2019s likely just going to cut them all out of her life if they keep pushing this. \n\nSkyler is her own person and deserves to be just that. Macey needs to live in the real world.", "This has obviously been coming for a while. Why do they think Skyler was even making these plans without discussing it with them? In any event, Macey's and parents' plans are so hypothetical: if you get into the same college, if accommodation puts you in the same room, if you share an apartment. Skyler is sensible to have multiple options. They become plans once the girls have an offer of a place.\nNTA", "NTA. Someone had to be straight with her. The other 3 sound like they aren\u2019t willing to let Skyler live her life independent of Mackey. \n\nGood on you for looking out for her.", "NTA. \n\nYou gave Macey the wake up call her dad and Ruth refused to and seemingly are the only one who has stuck up for Skyler. \n\nThe way they are treating Macey is setting her up to be an entitled princess who throws tantrums when she doesn\u2019t get her own way. \n\nGood on you for dealing a dose of reality about the situation. \n\nI feel so bad for Skyler that she seems to have her feelings/wants/needs overlooked for a sister who clearly has attachment issues. \n\nGoing to separate colleges will be good for both of them. Skyler will get to experience what she wants to experience without her sister tagging along. And Macey will hopefully grown and learn to be independent of Skyler and become her own person.", "NTA. It sounds like Macey has some real dependency issues based on how they were both treated for a long time, and Skyler is desperate for independence.\n\n\nPerhaps it'll help to sit with the parents and talk them through it objectively. If they keep trying to force Skyler to be someone she isn't (a twin to Macey), she will only resent all of them for it. All those years have not made her a willing participant in the \"twin\" thing, and forcing it has never made their relationship as siblings improve. \n\n\nThe parents cannot force the children to act how they want them to. They cannot make them feel a connection to each other. The parents need to wake up here because if they continue to push this agenda they will lose one of the kids. They're on the verge of adulthood and having their own choices, which means if they don't repair their relationship to Skyler now they could soon lose it forever. They need the bluntness as much as Macey does - both kids are individual people and should have their needs and wants respected. The focus now should be enabling Skyler to have her own identity and independence, and supporting Macey on finding *her* identity and to stop relying on Skyler to always be there to copy from and follow. \n\n\nEven real twins don't always like doing the same thing and being always connected to each other, half of that family are trying to live some idealised sitcom life to the detriment of the one who doesn't want that.", "NTA no one was going to tell Macey. You did the right thing, their parents are very controlling and sheltering. Who knows, maybe Skyler would like Macey if their parents hadn\u2019t forced some toxic relationship on them and successfully conditioned Macey to play into it.", "NTA - You appear to be the only one advocating for Skylar to get the future and life that *she* wants. Why is everyone so hellbent on keeping Macey happy? Is it because her mum left her and they're trying to overcompensate? That sort of thing is detrimental in the long run because (as you so rightly pointed out) as she grows up and goes out into the real world the reality won't always match her entitled expectations. Besides which, Skylar also lost a parent at a similar age and has always been pushed into this weird unhealthy codependency with her stepsister. It's no wonder she wants to break free and do her own thing !\n\nHave you spoken to your brother privately about all this at all and the alternative perspective? Either this specific situation or just their parenting of the girls as \"twins\" in general? Because it's obvious from your post that you don't agree with it and yet it's also obviously been going on like this for over a decade.", "> Skyler does not owe it to [them] to follow a plan everyone else made for her and that [they] needs to learn [Skyler] won't like [Macey] and [they] cannot force [her]. I told [them they] need to accept the reality; which is Skyler and [Macey] are highly unlikely to go to school together after senior year and [they are] not going to see [each other] all the time like [they] want. \n\nThis sounds like something you should have told your brother and Ruth about how they set up their daughters for failure by shipping them - but instead you took it out on their daughter.\n\nMacey's upset is understandable, all she wanted was a friend and sister but because of all this forced relationship narratives from her parents it'd be really difficult to see or accept the reality that it will never happen. Denial is a powerful delusion.\n\nESH. You could have handled that conversation better; The golden child isn't always an asshole  - those dynamics are created and reinforced by their parents and they did a huge disservice to both those girls.", "NTA Perhaps you could have been a bit more gentle but it was always going to be upsetting for Macey to realise her sister viewed their relationship differently. At least now she has the chance to speak to Skyler about it, listen to her version of their childhood and hopefully build a relationship as adults that is more honest.\n\nYour brother and Ruth really did both girls a disservice with this - Skyler had her needs ignored & was pushed to be closer than she wanted but Macey was also given a false idea of the relationship and set up for hurt. Ideally both girls would benefit from sessions with a good therapist - individually and together. The parents might benefit from therapy to realise how they have caused this but I suspect they won't listen to any point of view that doesn't match their idea of sisters who are best friends and do everything together!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Poor Skyler, I hope she gets into whichever college she wants and gets her freedom.\n\nINFO: What is your relationship with Skyler? I'm afraid that your brother and SiL might want to sabotage Skyler's efforts to go to college alone by throwing out her mail, etc. Does she have a trusted person to whose address her mail could go? You? Her grandparents?", "NTA she needs to realize it,your brother and her mom too,forcing a relationship on someone never ends well and skylar probably holds a grudge since years wouldn't be surprised if she completely Re.oves herself from the family when she has the means for it", "NTA. This is gross. If I were Skyler, I would cut off contact with both parents.", "NTA what is wrong with your brother and SIL?", "NTA\n\nBut I would suggest that you talk to Macey about how she and Skyler had very different experiences, growing up.\n\nMacey did not have an involved mother, or mother-figure.  so she imprinted on Ruth like a baby bird, and wanted Ruth and Skyler to fill in that gap in her life.\n\nSkyler had a father whom she loved, and who died.  Ruth rushed to replace him in her life, marrying your brother within a year of her first husband, Skyler's father's, death.  Skyler undoubtedly needed more time to mourn her father, and was not at all ready for a replacement father, or a new \"sister.\"  She was never given a chance to build a relationship with Macey, or with Macey's father, on her own terms.  \n\nHow was Skyler's father commemorated in their home?  Did the family display pictures of Skyler with her father?  Did her mother talk to her about her memories of her father, and help her remember?  \n\nI'm glad to see from your comments that Skyler does have a positive relationship with the paternal side of her family.  They are probably the best people to help Skyler negotiate this situation.  You may want to contact them, let them know that your brother and Beth are pushing for this \"college together\" scheme, and that they might offer to be Skyler's mailing address for the college application process, so that your brother and Beth can't sabotage Skyler's efforts to find a college away from Macey.  They might also offer to store Skyler's vital documents for her (birth certificate, social security card, high school diploma, once she has it) so that your brother and Beth can't use them to manipulate Skyler.\n\nSkyler likely won't trust you, because you are too closely associated with your brother.  You came into her life as part of your brother being pushed into a paternal role with her that she wasn't ready for. \n\nDo you know if they arranged for your brother to legally adopt Skyler?  They might have done so when she was too young to understand what was happening, and since her father died, it wasn't necessary for him to sign away parental rights. It would affect things like whether his income is counted towards the parental contribution in financial aid forms.", "NTA. Brother and SIL have a really unrealistic view of \u201craising them as twins.\u201d Any sane and rational twin parent will tell you that you have to treat twins like the individual children/people they are, and allow their relationship to develop naturally. Mine have been their own person since birth. Not all twins are extremely close. \nI think you could definitely continue to support Skyler in family conversations-if people start discussing college and this situation, \u201cDidn\u2019t Skyler say she wanted to go somewhere else? Why are her needs not as important as Macey\u2019s?\u201d", "NTA, but your brother and Ruth sure are (Macey was an innocent 6-year-old kid when this all started).  Rather than pushing the girls together and treating them like \"twins\" your brother and Ruth should have told Macey to give Skyler time to adjust and let her have her space.  If they'd done that, I bet Macey and Skyler would be much closer today.  They didn't do that and now are reaping what they sowed. \n\nMacey is a victim here, but she's not a victim of Skyler, she's a victim of her dad and stepmom.  Your brother and SIL let her live in an imaginary world where she and Skyler were the bestest of friends and almost like twins that would be together forever.  She needed the reality check you gave her much earlier than she got it, and it should have come from her father.\n\nSkyler is also a victim of her mother and your brother.  They ignored her wants and wishes.  They demanded that she go along with Macey's dreams at the expense of what she wanted.  That's a great way for someone to start to build resentment and hate towards another person.  It won't surprise me if Skyler cuts them out of her life once she graduates.", "Skyler appears to have good times whenever she's doing stuff away from the family or when she's with her family from her dad. The rest of the time she does look like she'd rather be anywhere else. But she clearly resented being pushed into things. My brother and Ruth never stopped to consider, and never wanted to listen to anyone who said, that Skyler deserved to have the right to say no and do her own thing.", "I think they're already too late to save it. But I also know they do not listen to me at all, or anyone who has voiced that things might not be such a good idea. I'm not sure who they would listen to. I think they see me as being too inexperienced with teenagers to have an opinion.", "I'm not sure what they are thinking regarding Skyler's choice to make plans without them. All I know is they do not like it. They expected Skyler to be as active in the plans they made with Macey as Macey is herself.", "There were attempts to tell them over the years. My brother and Ruth never listened.", "I can guarantee that Skyler would not sit down with Macey to discuss this and would never agree to attend therapy with her. She does everything she can to avoid spending even a second around Macey. My brother and Ruth have destroyed any chance for a relationship to be built between the girls. I do not believe Skyler will ever want that.", "My relationship with Skyler is distant sadly. She doesn't have a close relationship with anyone in the family and has walls up, which is unsurprising given she has a very poor experience with my brother. For her, I think it's hard to see any of us as trustworthy due to him. She does have her dad's side of the family who she appears very close to.", "I can't imagine how horrible it is to be pushed into something just to survive and kind of keep peace in the house. How was she treated when she said NO what was the punishment . This is mental abuse . I get tit that the parents want siblings to get along but even real siblings are not always close and if they are close they build the relationship on their own and are not force into it. This is crazy \n\nMacey has zero right to be upset . She doesn't own Skyper . It's to late to ask Skyper now why she didn't like Macey but it would have been better to leave the girls alone as long they don't fight . \n\nI wonder if Macey's brain was manipulted by her parents otherwise it is hard to understand how she did not notice that skyper doesn't feel the same and they played this sharade for over 10 years . Macey must have ignored any negative sign if she believed Skyler is her bff. I mean if I was so brainwashed like her I guess I would also be shocked and hurt that my \"BFF\" hated me so something happened to Macey and her parents to live in this fantasie world .", "If they're making you the AH, it would be an interesting question to ask them. Skyler has gone passive resistant on them: she's not said yes or no, she's just doing something else. A teenager who is doing this is telling you a lot more than which college they want to attend. \n\nDoes Macey regularly cry if she doesn't get her way? \n\nMy gut says parents have been in \"Macey mustn't feel sad\" mode since she was 6. Macey feeling sad that she won't get to be with Skyler forever is a legitimate thing to feel - but the way that's been processed by the parents (\"Skyler is the baddie for not giving her what she wants. OP is the baddie for telling her sad things\") rather than teaching her to process disappointment is not going to help her.", "That's a shame that it's got so far that they've destroyed any relationship and done lasting damage to both girls, yet they're persisting with trying to make them be together.\n\nObviously Skyler has come off worse in this but by the sounds of it Macey has been effectively lied to so much that she can't see how Skyler feels even when it's obvious to others.\n\nI hope there are other people in both girls live's that can support them because by the sounds of it the parents won't.", "Mhm. I'd still maybe try to suggest to her that she should make sure that all her letters and documents go to a safe place far away from your brother and her mum. It could go some way to show her that you support her and not your brother's insanity.", "The punishment was that her no was ignored. They didn't ground her but her saying no really made no difference to what was happening. They still went ahead with whatever it was that Macey wanted and they planned as per usual. Like the college thing. You would never think Skyler said no to hear them talk about how great this would be. Not once did they stop to recognize only 1/2 wanted this.\n\nMacey ignored a lot of signs and learned all she had to do was tell her parents she wanted to spend time with Skyler and regardless of Skyler's feelings, Macey got it.\n\nThey set Macey up to be very entitled and to handle relationships poorly.", "She actually did say no to their plans. They simply ignored her no and carried on as though she had not spoken.\n\nNot that I'm aware of but she could be doing it more than I realize.", "I can try. There is no guarantee she will trust me enough to hear me out but I am willing to attempt this so that at least help in some small way at least.", "This is excellent advice. It gives her some good suggestions on how to help her not get forced into a situation against her will by her mom and step-dad. It would be beneficial for her to gather any and all money she may have and put it somewhere they cannot touch, like a secret bank account or even just keeping it with her father\u2019s family. \n\nOP, definitely NTA. Your niece needs a major reality check. She has been spoiled and enabled and it\u2019s turned her into someone unable to function in the real world. Better for her to learn sooner rather than later. \nYour behavior shows Skyler some solidarity and reassurance that she isn\u2019t wrong in wanting to live her own life and not be her step-sister\u2019s living Kid Sister doll.", "Obviously you are NTA who cares how Macey feels she can cry for years now like she harmed Skyler for years . It like teaching Skyper NO doesn't exist so now a guy can rape her because even when she says No it has no meaning and no value ppl will still run over her.  All Skyler needs now is the support to get whatever education she wants so she can support herself and get away from them . This is insane .", "Oof. If they're ignoring her, I'd stay out of the Macey/parents dynamic and be ready to help Skyler out when she needs it. And still NTA.", "It might help to show her this post. It's one thing to tell someone that you hear them and are on their side. It's quite another for that person to see the evidence of it and read, in depth, how much of their treatment you witnessed, understood, and found desperately unfair."]}
