My brother and Ruth have been married since the girls (17f currently) were both 6. Ruth's first husband died when Skyler was 5 and Macey's mom chose not to be in her life. Because the girls are the same age my brother and Ruth decided that it would be cute to treat them like twins and Macey loved it while Skyler hated it.\n\nMacey always saw Skyler as her BFF and sister. Skyler doesn't like Macey and I don't think there has ever been a time she has enjoyed spending time with Macey. I'm almost positive she'd love to yeet her from her life entirely. They were always pushed together if Macey expressed an interest or mentioned to her parents that she wanted time with Skyler.\n\nTwo years ago the topic of college was first brought up and a plan was made that the girls would go to the same college if possible and would request to be roommates if successful. The plan was for them to attend college in the same town and live in dorms for Freshman year and the plan was further detailed to say they would rent an apartment together for the other three years. This was to keep them close and to provide extra safety to them, apparently. Skyler was never on board with the plan. I heard her say it, my brother heard her say it, Ruth heard her say it, Macey heard her say it, Ruth's parents and my parents heard her say it, my other brother heard her say it. We all did. But my brother, Ruth and Macey decided to ignore this.\n\nLast month Macey heard Skyler talking to her friends and they were talking about college and she heard them making plans together for college. She also heard Skyler say she'd pick the college furthest from her. Macey was so upset and told her parents and hellfire rained down on their house and Skyler was in trouble for making those plans.\n\nMacey's emotions have been all over the place these last few weeks. She goes from sad to angry and even surprised that Skyler was angry at her for telling her mom. My brother and Ruth were framing it like poor Macey, she's the victim here and I was in shock. I understand her being upset that Skyler doesn't feel the same way but this should not come as a surprise to her. They are acting like Macey is 6 and Skyler bullied her and treated some much younger kid badly. When all she did was try to do her own thing and get some independence. \n\nSo when Macey came to me and complained to me I was a lot harsher than maybe I should be. I told her that Skyler does not owe it to her to follow a plan everyone else made for her and that she needs to learn some people won't like her and she cannot force them. I told her she needs to accept the reality; which is Skyler and her are highly unlikely to go to school together after senior year and she's not going to see her all the time like she wants. Macey was crying by the time I finished.

Who cares that she cries now Skyler cried alone in her bed for years so Macey needs a wake up call", "NTA. Skyler has been forced to be a bff sidekick for years when she clearly did not want to. Your brother, Ruth, and Macey are insane to think this would continue once she\u2019s a legal adult who can get the hell away from them. You should really sit and talk with your brother and Ruth because eventually she\u2019s likely just going to cut them all out of her life if they keep pushing this. \n\nSkyler is her own person and deserves to be just that. Macey needs to live in the real world.", "This has obviously been coming for a while. Why do they think Skyler was even making these plans without discussing it with them? In any event, Macey's and parents' plans are so hypothetical: if you get into the same college, if accommodation puts you in the same room, if you share an apartment. Skyler is sensible to have multiple options. They become plans once the girls have an offer of a place.\nNTA", "NTA. Someone had to be straight with her. The other 3 sound like they aren\u2019t willing to let Skyler live her life independent of Macey. \n\nGood on you for looking out for her.", "NTA. \n\nYou gave Macey the wake up call her dad and Ruth refused to and seemingly are the only one who has stuck up for Skyler. \n\nThe way they are treating Macey is setting her up to be an entitled princess who throws tantrums when she doesn\u2019t get her own way. \n\nGood on you for dealing a dose of reality about the situation. \n\nI feel so bad for Skyler that she seems to have her feelings/wants/needs overlooked for a sister who clearly has attachment issues. \n\nGoing to separate colleges will be good for both of them. Skyler will get to experience what she wants to experience without her sister tagging along. And Macey will hopefully grown and learn to be independent of Skyler and become her own person.", "NTA. It sounds like Macey has some real dependency issues based on how they were both treated for a long time, and Skyler is desperate for independence.\n\n\nPerhaps it'll help to sit with the parents and talk them through it objectively. If they keep trying to force Skyler to be someone she isn't (a twin to Macey), she will only resent all of them for it. All those years have not made her a willing participant in the \"twin\" thing, and forcing it has never made their relationship as siblings improve. \n\n\nThe parents cannot force the children to act how they want them to. They cannot make them feel a connection to each other. The parents need to wake up here because if they continue to push this agenda they will lose one of the kids. They're on the verge of adulthood and having their own choices, which means if they don't repair their relationship to Skyler now they could soon lose it forever. They need the bluntness as much as Macey does - both kids are individual people and should have their needs and wants respected. The focus now should be enabling Skyler to have her own identity and independence, and supporting Macey on finding *her* identity and to stop relying on Skyler to always be there to copy from and follow. \n\n\nEven real twins don't always like doing the same thing and being always connected to each other, half of that family are trying to live some idealised sitcom life to the detriment of the one who doesn't want that.", "NTA no one was going to tell Macey. You did the right thing, their parents are very controlling and sheltering. Who knows, maybe Skyler would like Macey if their parents hadn\u2019t forced some toxic relationship on them and successfully conditioned Macey to play into it.", "NTA - You appear to be the only one advocating for Skylar to get the future and life that *she* wants. Why is everyone so hellbent on keeping Macey happy? Is it because her mum left her and they're trying to overcompensate? That sort of thing is detrimental in the long run because (as you so rightly pointed out) as she grows up and goes out into the real world the reality won't always match her entitled expectations. Besides which, Skylar also lost a parent at a similar age and has always been pushed into this weird unhealthy codependency with her stepsister. It's no wonder she wants to break free and do her own thing !\n\nHave you spoken to your brother privately about all this at all and the alternative perspective? Either this specific situation or just their parenting of the girls as \"twins\" in general? Because it's obvious from your post that you don't agree with it and yet it's also obviously been going on like this for over a decade.", "> Skyler does not owe it to [them] to follow a plan everyone else made for her and that [they] needs to learn [Skyler] won't like [Macey] and [they] cannot force [her]. I told [them they] need to accept the reality; which is Skyler and [Macey] are highly unlikely to go to school together after senior year and [they are] not going to see [each other] all the time like [they] want. \n\nThis sounds like something you should have told your brother and Ruth about how they set up their daughters for failure by shipping them - but instead you took it out on their daughter.\n\nMacey's upset is understandable, all she wanted was a friend and sister but because of all this forced relationship narratives from her parents it'd be really difficult to see or accept the reality that it will never happen. Denial is a powerful delusion.\n\nESH. You could have handled that conversation better; The golden child isn't always an asshole  - those dynamics are created and reinforced by their parents and they did a huge disservice to both those girls.", "NTA Perhaps you could have been a bit more gentle but it was always going to be upsetting for Macey to realise her sister viewed their relationship differently. At least now she has the chance to speak to Skyler about it, listen to her version of their childhood and hopefully build a relationship as adults that is more honest.\n\nYour brother and Ruth really did both girls a disservice with this - Skyler had her needs ignored & was pushed to be closer than she wanted but Macey was also given a false idea of the relationship and set up for hurt. Ideally both girls would benefit from sessions with a good therapist - individually and together. The parents might benefit from therapy to realise how they have caused this but I suspect they won't listen to any point of view that doesn't match their idea of sisters who are best friends and do everything together!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Poor Skyler, I hope she gets into whichever college she wants and gets her freedom.\n\nINFO: What is your relationship with Skyler? I'm afraid that your brother and SiL might want to sabotage Skyler's efforts to go to college alone by throwing out her mail, etc. Does she have a trusted person to whose address her mail could go? You? Her grandparents?", "NTA she needs to realize it,your brother and her mom too,forcing a relationship on someone never ends well and skylar probably holds a grudge since years wouldn't be surprised if she completely Re.oves herself from the family when she has the means for it", "NTA. This is gross. If I were Skyler, I would cut off contact with both parents.", "NTA what is wrong with your brother and SIL?", "NTA\n\nBut I would suggest that you talk to Macey about how she and Skyler had very different experiences, growing up.\n\nMacey did not have an involved mother, or mother-figure.  so she imprinted on Ruth like a baby bird, and wanted Ruth and Skyler to fill in that gap in her life.\n\nSkyler had a father whom she loved, and who died.  Ruth rushed to replace him in her life, marrying your brother within a year of her first husband, Skyler's father's, death.  Skyler undoubtedly needed more time to mourn her father, and was not at all ready for a replacement father, or a new \"sister.\"  She was never given a chance to build a relationship with Macey, or with Macey's father, on her own terms.\n\nHow was Skyler's father commemorated in their home?  Did the family display pictures of Skyler with her father?  Did her mother talk to her about her memories of her father, and help her remember?\n\nI'm glad to see from your comments that Skyler does have a positive relationship with the paternal side of her family.  They are probably the best people to help Skyler negotiate this situation.  You may want to contact them, let them know that your brother and Ruth are pushing for this \"college together\" scheme, and that they might offer to be Skyler's mailing address for the college application process, so that your brother and Beth can't sabotage Skyler's efforts to find a college away from Macey.  They might also offer to store Skyler's vital documents for her (birth certificate, social security card, high school diploma, once she has it) so that your brother and Beth can't use them to manipulate Skyler.\n\nSkyler likely won't trust you, because you are too closely associated with your brother.  You came into her life as part of your brother being pushed into a paternal role with her that she wasn't ready for.\n\nDo you know if they arranged for your brother to legally adopt Skyler?  They might have done so when she was too young to understand what was happening, and since her father died, it wasn't necessary for him to sign away parental rights. It would affect things like whether his income is counted towards the parental contribution in financial aid forms.", "NTA. Brother and SIL have a really unrealistic view of \u201craising them as twins.\u201d Any sane and rational twin parent will tell you that you have to treat twins like the individual children/people they are, and allow their relationship to develop naturally. Mine have been their own person since birth. Not all twins are extremely close. \nI think you could definitely continue to support Skyler in family conversations-if people start discussing college and this situation, \u201cDidn\u2019t Skyler say she wanted to go somewhere else? Why are her needs not as important as Macey\u2019s?\u201d", "NTA, but your brother and Ruth sure are (Macey was an innocent 6-year-old kid when this all started).  Rather than pushing the girls together and treating them like \"twins\" your brother and Ruth should have told Macey to give Skyler time to adjust and let her have her space.  If they'd done that, I bet Macey and Skyler would be much closer today.  They didn't do that and now are reaping what they sowed. \n\nMacey is a victim here, but she's not a victim of Skyler, she's a victim of her dad and stepmom.  Your brother and SIL let her live in an imaginary world where she and Skyler were the bestest of friends and almost like twins that would be together forever.  She needed the reality check you gave her much earlier than she got it, and it should have come from her father.\n\nSkyler is also a victim of her mother and your brother.  They ignored her wants and wishes.  They demanded that she go along with Macey's dreams at the expense of what she wanted.  That's a great way for someone to start to build resentment and hate towards another person.  It won't surprise me if Skyler cuts them out of her life once she graduates.", "Skyler appears to have good times whenever she's doing stuff away from the family or when she's with her family from her dad. The rest of the time she does look like she'd rather be anywhere else. But she clearly resented being pushed into things. My brother and Ruth never stopped to consider, and never wanted to listen to anyone who said, that Skyler deserved to have the right to say no and do her own thing.", "I think they're already too late to save it. But I also know they do not listen to me at all, or anyone who has voiced that things might not be such a good idea. I'm not sure who they would listen to. I think they see me as being too inexperienced with teenagers to have an opinion.", "I'm not sure what they are thinking regarding Skyler's choice to make plans without them. All I know is they do not like it. They expected Skyler to be as active in the plans they made with Macey as Macey is herself.", "There were attempts to tell them over the years. My brother and Ruth never listened.", "I can guarantee that Skyler would not sit down with Macey to discuss this and would never agree to attend therapy with her. She does everything she can to avoid spending even a second around Macey. My brother and Ruth have destroyed any chance for a relationship to be built between the girls. I do not believe Skyler will ever want that.", "My relationship with Skyler is distant sadly. She doesn't have a close relationship with anyone in the family and has walls up, which is unsurprising given she has a very poor experience with my brother. For her, I think it's hard to see any of us as trustworthy due to him. She does have her dad's side of the family who she appears very close to.", "I can't imagine how horrible it is to be pushed into something just to survive and kind of keep peace in the house. How was she treated when she said NO what was the punishment . This is mental abuse . I get tit that the parents want siblings to get along but even real siblings are not always close and if they are close they build the relationship on their own and are not force into it. This is crazy \n\nMacey has zero right to be upset . She doesn't own Skyper . It's to late to ask Skyper now why she didn't like Macey but it would have been better to leave the girls alone as long they don't fight . \n\nI wonder if Macey's brain was manipulted by her parents otherwise it is hard to understand how she did not notice that skyper doesn't feel the same and they played this sharade for over 10 years . Macey must have ignored any negative sign if she believed Skyler is her bff. I mean if I was so brainwashed like her I guess I would also be shocked and hurt that my \"BFF\" hated me so something happened to Macey and her parents to live in this fantasie world .", "If they're making you the AH, it would be an interesting question to ask them. Skyler has gone passive resistant on them: she's not said yes or no, she's just doing something else. A teenager who is doing this is telling you a lot more than which college they want to attend. \n\nDoes Macey regularly cry if she doesn't get her way? \n\nMy gut says parents have been in \"Macey mustn't feel sad\" mode since she was 6. Macey feeling sad that she won't get to be with Skyler forever is a legitimate thing to feel - but the way that's been processed by the parents (\"Skyler is the baddie for not giving her what she wants. OP is the baddie for telling her sad things\") rather than teaching her to process disappointment is not going to help her.", "That's a shame that it's got so far that they've destroyed any relationship and done lasting damage to both girls, yet they're persisting with trying to make them be together.\n\nObviously Skyler has come off worse in this but by the sounds of it Macey has been effectively lied to so much that she can't see how Skyler feels even when it's obvious to others.\n\nI hope there are other people in both girls live's that can support them because by the sounds of it the parents won't.", "Mhm. I'd still maybe try to suggest to her that she should make sure that all her letters and documents go to a safe place far away from your brother and her mum. It could go some way to show her that you support her and not your brother's insanity.", "The punishment was that her no was ignored. They didn't ground her but her saying no really made no difference to what was happening. They still went ahead with whatever it was that Macey wanted and they planned as per usual. Like the college thing. You would never think Skyler said no to hear them talk about how great this would be. Not once did they stop to recognize only 1/2 wanted this.\n\nMacey ignored a lot of signs and learned all she had to do was tell her parents she wanted to spend time with Skyler and regardless of Skyler's feelings, Macey got it.\n\nThey set Macey up to be very entitled and to handle relationships poorly.", "She actually did say no to their plans. They simply ignored her no and carried on as though she had not spoken.\n\nNot that I'm aware of but she could be doing it more than I realize.", "I can try. There is no guarantee she will trust me enough to hear me out but I am willing to attempt this so that at least help in some small way at least.", "This is excellent advice. It gives her some good suggestions on how to help her not get forced into a situation against her will by her mom and step-dad. It would be beneficial for her to gather any and all money she may have and put it somewhere they cannot touch, like a secret bank account or even just keeping it with her father\u2019s family. \n\nOP, definitely NTA. Your niece needs a major reality check. She has been spoiled and enabled and it\u2019s turned her into someone unable to function in the real world. Better for her to learn sooner rather than later. \nYour behavior shows Skyler some solidarity and reassurance that she isn\u2019t wrong in wanting to live her own life and not be her step-sister\u2019s living Kid Sister doll.", "Obviously you are NTA who cares how Macey feels she can cry for years now like she harmed Skyler for years . It like teaching Skyper NO doesn't exist so now a guy can rape her because even when she says No it has no meaning and no value ppl will still run over her.

I was an RA in undergrad and I doubt that would even be allowed unless there were extreme mitigating circumstances. \n\nMacey needs to learn this lesson. Were you harsh? Maybe. But it sounds like Skyler has endured years of people ignoring what she wants.

Just depends on the university. The letter tells you how to begin the electronic communications.", "Skyler does not call my brother dad. She uses both his and Macey's name and does not give any familial titles to either when talking about them.", "I get that, but I think that your frustration with them and seeing Skyler suffer like that were all channeled into that really contemptuous response to Macey. You more or less blamed her for how Skyler is behaving as if all the years of neglect were her fault even though she had very little power over how she or Skyler were treated.\n\n\nYou could have given her the \"College is a time when people often want to make huge changes,  go out on their own to far places, and find out who they are as individuals\" spiel, which would not only be a totally true statement but it also helps her see that going out on one's own is a natural and good thing for personal development. \n\n\nFrom Macey's perspective her understanding of herself and her family is shattered. She's learned the reality of her relationships that she grew up with isn't the truth; her parents are not going to be truthful to her and the one person that can tell her the true story - Skyler - probably will not tell her squat. So everything is falling apart and she has no clue why.\n\n\nI think once Skyler escapes this whole thing they will be _relatively_ okay, their sense of independence indicates they maintained a sense of identity that will hopefully flourish if given the chance; I think Macey however will need a lot of help. I worry she may have bought so hard into her parent's twinsie sister bestie fantasy that she may struggle with finding and developing her own individual identity and forming trusting relationships.

She probably learned early on that acting in a specific way gets her parents attention, that\u2019s why she\u2019s a team player and being the obvious kind loving family girl, because it causes less waves in a stepchild family.

They are being selfish and thinking about their own wants over their children because of Macy giving them false support by hiding her feelings and just plastering a smile on constantly.

Definitely NTA. She needed this reality check sooner than later.", "Nta. About time someone stepped up for her.", "NTA. But your brother and his wife sure are. They have made Macey emotionally dependent on Skylar. That is so unhealthy for both girls. Skylar does not owe it to Macey to be her emotional support animal. I hope Skylar is able to leave. Macey needs help being independent not to be made a victim.", "If they were *actually twins who liked each other* then this level of micromanaging would *still* be inappropriate.\n\nAnd maybe Skyler would like Macey more if she'd been allowed to do things on her own!\n\nNTA.

I absolutely foresee graduation day and Skyler grabbing all of her belongings and moving in with her dad's family and going complete NC with all 3 of them. To any future step parents please don't treat the kids this way. Life is not one continuous episode of the Brady Bunch. Kids aren't props to be placed at the best angles and forced to act like it's a love fest.

The way Skylar has been relegated to an accessory in Macey's life guarantees that she'll go NC the second she has the chance.

Her dad died and then she was forced to pretend to be someone else's shadow person her entire childhood.", "NTA.\n\nGood for you giving the much needed reality check.  And good for Skyler for not just accepting this BS.  You might want to let the parents know if they continue this, it's going to lead to LC/NC from her just so she can get away, if that's not already her plan (sounds like it 100% is for dealing with Macey).  Also let Skyler know the internet is behind her on this!", "NTA. Your brother and his wife have coddled Macey at the expense of Skyler.

What a horrible situation to push her into as a child 1 year after her father dies! But to keep this up and plan out her whole life according to her step-sister\u2019s wishes?? This is so fucked up. Kudos to you for standing up for Skyler. Tell their parents if they want to have a fantasy like this, go play The Sims. Their daughters are human beings who deserve to live their own lives.", "NTA but the brother, SIL and Macey sure are.", "Nta. Seems like the whole family has allowed Macey to emotionally bully and suffocate Sklylar their whole lives and punished Skylar for just wanting to breathe. Their attempt to force a relationship has made Macey feel entitled to the relationship she wants and it's flat out abusive that Skylar has never been allowed to have boundaries. Maybe if Ruth and your bro had given Skylar a bit of space to breathe and taught Macey that she can't chokehold and manipulate her sister they could have developed a loving relationship.\nWhat you told Macey was something she needed to hear. I hope you were actually able to give direct support to skylar too because it feels like she's always being punished for not conforming to their little conjoined twin fantasy.

Ruth and bro need to backnoffnor she's gonna go completely NC with them", "NTA in this matter, but I have to ask: did anyone ever stand up for Skyler during all those years?\n\nLike, it seems like you and pretty much everyone else knew what was going on. Did none of you ever reach out to Skyler telling her you knew what she was going through or offering to help her? Did none of you ever try to talk to your brother and Ruth about how they treated Skyler and how that clearly affected her? Did her father know? Did he try to help her? \nBecause if not, you are all pretty shitty tbh, if you let this girl suffer for years without trying to help her out.", "I mean, Macey would literally have to be insane or severely mentally ill to think that someone who disliked her was her best friend her entire life.", "Okay you're being a little dramatic here. \"Skyler cried alone in her bed for years\"? \"Skyler was abused\"? \"Torture for 10 years\"?

We're my brother's family so she has never trusted us or regarded us as her family.\n\nThey won't consider counseling for Macey themselves.", "I don\u2019t think Skyler needs therapy but the rest of them sure do.", "Well it\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re not Skyler.", "Yeah. Skyler is gonna go NC with Ruth, your brother  etc as soon as she can.", "Yeah.

Knowing she has you in her corner is important.", "People on AITA still seem to think everything is done by mail when they're making up these stories LOL", "My daughter still received paper letters just a few years ago.", "So I\u2019m going to add that Skyler probably needs counseling (I know I said she doesn\u2019t). She needs it for herself. For her trauma. To know that she can say no and can stand up to them. Not to figure out how to have a relationship with them on their terms but on her terms. And her terms may very well be NC. And that is fine. She has been traumatized since she her dad died.", "After going through years of having her needs ignored and essentially not being allowed to say no to spending time with her step sister I'd imagine she would really benefit from individual therapy. It will have had an impact on how she builds relationships and probably her ability to trust people - that's stuff that is difficult if not impossible to change on your own.", "I'm not sure. Her paternal side of the family might want to help her with college. Couldn't say for sure though. But it sounds like she's planning for college and Skyler always struck me as a smart kid so I figure she has thought of that.", "Poor Skyler!! Her dad dies b4 she's even 6 yrs old, and then she loses all sense of self-worth and value!! Or, more accurately, has her sense of self-worth taken from her. I'm really curious, do you hv any sense of why Ruth was so focused on Macey and so ignorant of her daughter's needs? \n\nIf you can, I hope you let Skyler know you're there for her, not in an us vs them way necessarily, but just so she knows that there is someone who sees her side of things, loves her and values her as a person, and someone she can say anything to.\n\nDefinitely NTA!! Macey needed to hear it, and Skyler needs to know that someone has her back. You were def not too harsh w Macey, just honest. It's a shame their parents don't follow your example!! Well done on your part!", "You absolutely did the right thing. It needed to be said. Macey can't go through life forcing her will on other people and throwing a tantrum every time someone says no. Her parents set Macey up to be incredibly emotionally manipulative and that can't go unchecked. They allowed one daughter to be a total AH to the other. \n\nSkyler just wants some independence. She should be able to make her own decisions. She never got that as a child and now they want to restrict her as an adult. Where does it end? She has to work in the same city as Macey after college? They have to get married at the same time in the same venue? This is ridiculous. Macey isn't the only one allowed to make decisions!\n\nYou just need to let your other niece know that you support her. I'm sure you're already aware but college is a difficult social transition, but it'll be even harder for her since she's been pressured to be a people pleaser her entire life. She'll need a good support system and someone to go to when things are difficult. Thanks for being a good aunt to both of them! NTA", "I hope Skyler has a strong support system outside the family. It sounds like Macey might never have the maturity to build relationships since she has never learned to take the needs of others into consideration. How very sad for both girls.", "I'd suggest talking to her about it to be sure. Maybe offer to help her search for scholarships or funding options if she wants. Make it clear she can trust you to help her with her own plans rather than forcing her into her parents plans.", "Is it possible for Skylar to appear to be going along with the plan,while secretly applying to colleges she really wants to go? Maybe get help from  her paternal side or even you. I don't know how close to 18 she is,but maybe she could move in with someone else that will support her,so she doesn't have to deal with it anymore. \n\nYou are NOT the AH.", "Talk to Skyler and tell her you support her. If you want any relationship with her in the future.\n\nThis is your chance to do it.", "Show her this post.", "I reread the post and Macey's mom chose not to be in her life. I wonder if they're being protective to cushion any sense of rejection by her bio mom, while simultaneously neglecting the emotional needs of the child whose parent died.

Hopefully Skyler can be free.", "You and Skylar are the only ones here who aren't AHs, although I have a bit more sympathy towards Macey as she was clearly raised with these unrealistic expectations. Even if they were biological twins, they likely wouldn't go to the same college. Your brother and his wife are the biggest AHs here and total failures as parents. I don't blame Skylar one but for getting the hell out of there at first opportunity. They completely destroyed any chance of the two forming a genuine relationship with each other by forcing this twin nonsense (newsflash: that kind of treatment is awful for actual twins too). If they hadn't been so pushy, the girls could have ended up being relatively close. But they ruined that. NTA", "NTA. You didn\u2019t go out of your way to voice your opinion - she came to you, probably thinking you\u2019d placate her and you didn\u2019t. That\u2019s it.", "NTA they need to understand that Skyler is a person who has her own feelings and makes her own decisions, not an accessory for Macey", "Everyone is saying you're great for standing up for Skylar, and that's very true. But I think it could be worth having another talk with Macey too. This doesn't have to take away from helping Skylar, I just think it would be good to actually explain to Macey why you said those things, like plan the convo in advance of how to explain it. If you just harshly say those things to a coddled teen without explaining yourself, she's going to think you just resent her for no reason because that's how she's been taught. \n\nI think the girls relationship is natural. Skylar lost a parent and was rushed into a new family she probably didn't want just a year later, Macey was abandoned and probably very excited for a new mom and sister. She should be old enough to understand her sisters feelings by now, but the fact is we learn from our parents. Maceys parents dismissed Skylar's feelings and taught Macey she can fix things by being extra loving, they taught her to dismiss Skylar's feelings and coddled her so much she is probably oblivious to them entirely. \n\nIt helps if you don't put the blame entirely on Macey, but her parents too. Tell her that the parents have always dismissed Skylar's feelings in favor of Macey, ask her how she would feel if the situation was reversed. Explain how hard it is to get a new family so soon after the death of a parent, and how not every kid is excited for a new family and being pushed to always serve the other kid makes that worse. If you think Skylar is chill enough to accept it, maybe even advise macey to have a talk with Skylar and ask how SHE feels. Tell her to stop listening to how her parents say Skylar feels, and actually listen to Skylar say how she feels, they're 17 for goodness sakes nearly adults, Skylar can speak for herself and Macey doesn't need to cry and tattle every time she doesn't get her way. \n\nMacey sounds like a brat so maybe you don't have the mental energy for it, but if you care about her, do your best to set her up for success. Same goes for Skylar, let her know you're on her side and will help if you can, but also encourage her to express how she feels to Macey directly, she can tell Macey theyre old enough to have their own thoughts without everything being filtered through the parents. If Macey cries to daddy again we'll, that's that I guess. But at least you gave her a chance.", "NAH. This is a tough situation for everyone. And everyone is entitled to their opinions. Macey is allowed to be upset about Skyler not liking her just as much as Skyler is allowed to be upset she isn\u2019t getting enough freedom/independence and is likely resenting Macey heavily. You as parents are doing the best you can, and while you may have been \u201ctoo harsh\u201d about the fact not everyone will like Macey and that\u2019s something she and everyone in the world needs to live with and accept, it doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s AT ALL the main issue.\n\nMaybe they need some time apart, parents take a step back \u201cconnecting\u201d then, and the opportunity to reconnect can come later. The phrase \u201ctime heals\u201d can be pretty controversial, but I think I\u2019m this case it may be true. Let Skyler spend some time away from Macey and don\u2019t make her feel like she *HAS* to do something. Make Macey know that it\u2019s not necessarily her fault (maybe it is, idk, honestly I don\u2019t think that matters much in this exact moment), but the point is Macey sounds like a she\u2019s slightly co-dependent/jealous/envious of Skyler and she may need some extra 1:1 time, where Skyler needs more alone time.\n\nI think the biggest mistake was trying to treat them as \u201ctwins\u201d simply because they\u2019re similar ages. Twins are not fond of the \u201ccomparison\u201d dilemma, so unless THEY claimed they were \u201ctwins\u201d by personality and, there is literally nothing connecting them except their parents\u2019 relationship. \n\nYou can\u2019t force meaningful relationships. You can only force proximity and civility, sometimes.. which may backfire. I think you need to let them navigate this on their own and accept it may not end the way you want it to, but it\u2019s not about you.", "\u201cMacey always saw Skyler as her BFF and sister.

Did skyler have a bff in middle school or high school that she talked about? Has Macey ever had any friends who actually liked her so she could see the difference?\n\nAnd the parents were making out like they were twins when one of them didn\u2019t even like the other one.

If Skyler has made it clear every time that she wants her own space then Macey is showing a lot of entitlement to think she can force herself into it. \n\nWhen I was younger my best friend had to take her sister everywhere (her sister was 3 years younger) and was forced to spend all her time with her. I think their parents wanted both kids out of the house but both of them hated it. My friends sister was an introvert and painfully shy, it was so awkward having her forced to join us when you could see she clearly wanted to be at home. \n\nMy friend begged her parents for her own life but she had to share a room with her sister and her friends started getting frustrated because if her sister joined us then we had to do things age related for her sister. \nWe couldn\u2019t go to the cinema because her sister was too young to see the films we wanted, we had to censor conversations, if anyone brought any alcohol her sister would tell her parents etc\u2026\n\nMy friend left home at 18 and her parents continued trying to push her sister on her, they would book to go away for a weekend and drop her sister off at my friends flat, they constantly begged my friend to take her sister out for the day. \n\nMy friend ended up changing her phone number and moving house and going NC.

They are attacking her for wanting to be her own person and wanting to study what she wants to study . They are forcing her to play twins for 10 years", "My son received paper letters, too, just this past year.", "What year?", "Heaven forbid Skyler gets a full-ride scholarship and Macey doesn't", "Why are people downvoting you???

I was just wondering if Skyler could actually afford to defy her parents.", "Sounds like Macey was the golden child at all times and Skylar was supposed to be the happy tagalong bowing scraping worshipping and following whatever Macey wanted. No wonder she resented Macey.  Macey never learned boundaries or compromise or respect. And I can just imagine the stress of having no personal space and probably no personal property that was hers alone or off limits to macey", "A bit hard to blame Macey for ignoring the signs, as she just copied her parents' behaviour. She had nobody to teach her how to behave decently. It's all much more her (step-) parents than her fault. And i feel a bit sorry for her: all the illusions and lies that her mother and stepfather have propped up for her benefit suddenly come crushing down.", "Because they\u2019re either children who have no idea what they\u2019re talking about or boomers who think things are still like they were in the sixties lol", "It sounds like you enjoyed presenting this info bluntly.

If I was in Skylar's position I'd leave and never speak to any of those people again", "NTA. Macy is a brat and obviously her parents favorite. They are NOT twins yet they tried to raise them as such. Betting that they forced Skyler to do what Macy wanted to do, ignoring that she had her own personality.\nThese will be the parents that will accuse Skyler of not loving them after \u201ceverything they did for her\u201d or refusing to pay for her college if she doesn\u2019t kiss their; sorry excuse of parenting, ass.\nYou told Macy the truth. Skyler owes her nothing and I won\u2019t be surprised if she goes NC or LC with her and parents. I really hope Skyler can be freed from them. She deserves a life of her own.", "NTA - this may be a wake up for everyone\n\nMaybe talk to Macey again and put it to her this way.. she cares for Skyler and needs to think about what Skyler's needs are and not just her own (as her parents have been doing) Actually taking Skyler's side would be HUGE. If she hopes for a future relationship with Skyler, backing off and letting Skyler be the one to set boundaries may help, but it may be too late. \n\nMacey is a victim here too. They fostered her codependent behavior and severely hindered her own sense of self it seems. Macey needs her own space to grow. The whole situation is sad.", "NTA very obviously but your brother and his wife are emotionally abusive and someone beed to sit them down and confront them with the reality of the situation just like you did Macy. They arent doing Macy any favors by encouraging this. She has zero emotional regulation. Poor Skylar.

Skylar s mom is going to be wondering what she did wrong when her daughter goes NC soon", "NTA Ruth and your brother are assholes for putting Skylar through all that .

Would you be willing to let her live at your home to finish school if needed once she is 18?  Advise her to talk to the schools social worker on her home life and have her request to go live with her dad's family.  At 17 there is a good chance they can assist her in getting out of that mess before she turns 18.", "NTA. Skyler is going to go NC with all of them as soon as she gets to college. And rightfully so. You should reach out to her and let you know that you support her.", "NTA\u2026 skyler needs to intentionally apply to all different colleges than macey and not tell ANYONE which colleges she\u2019s applying for. She also needs to apply for every possible type of scholarship and financial aid and make plans for when her parents inevitably cut her off. Once she\u2019s accepted to college & turns 18, she needs to run and never look back. These ppl are insane and about to loose their kid", "NTA, but learn a little tact. \nPretend their twins? WTF.  I can\u2019t imagine my individualism being squashed, because it suited a parent\u2019s narrative. College is going to require Macey break down situations into bits and pieces in order to learn why things evolve the way they do.  Asking her to see it from Skylar\u2019s point of view would have been infinitely more helpful.", "Because her parents told her so repeatedly from the time she was six years old.\n\nPlus, if they\u2019ve forced the two girls to do everything together their entire lives, Macey may have never gotten the chance to have a normal close friendship to compare it to.", "Why don't you take Skyler out to lunch and tell her how you feel about her situation.  Unless you have been going along with your brother and Ruth's plans, I suspect she will be glad to hear that you support her in her quest to make her own decisions.\n\nThe only good thing for Skyler in this is that she has her father's family to turn to.  I suspect once she does that, she won't be turning back to her mother and your brother.", "Is Marcy quite thick in other areas of her life? Are your brother and his wife trying to \u2018protect\u2019 her from the world?", "I had a pair of identical twins in one of my classes who were taking all the same classes and wore the same outfits. It seemed kind of weird to me at that age but if they were happy cool I guess?", "Why didn\u2019t you phrase it like this to Macey? I mean she\u2019s not six so she should have got the message sooner, but clearly she\u2019s been enabled. Why not ask her - did Skylar ever say she wanted to do this? Has Skylar ever said no? Why does she get ignored? Do you think that\u2019s fair? \n\nTelling a teen girl people don\u2019t like her was a little rough. Her issue  was liking step sister too much.

NTA, someone had to say it.", "It might be too late", "Well said", "I\u2019m glad you mentioned it did Macey no service either. Like I feel this is slightly ESH I feel bad for Skylar that everyone ignored her. Everyone\u2019s bashing Macey but imagine loving someone for most of your life thinking that\u2019s my sibling and bff and then finding you they don\u2019t love you or even like you. OP was pretty harsh and could have recognized she\u2019s going to feel extremely hurt as well. The people who really failed here was Ruth and Brother. This isn\u2019t about not getting what she wants it\u2019s about realizing a bond you had for years never existed.", "Agreed!   And they had this fantasy of living together through the entire college career?? Ugh stifling and delusional", "I wouldn\u2019t bother with showing her the post honestly.

You can tell her you wish you\u2019d come up with a way to help her throughout the years, but that you care for her and are prepared to support her now and in the future if she chooses to have a relationship with you.

Make sure that she applies for every scholarship, even small ones add up, help her find a school she lives and help her set up separate bank accounts, get on her own phone plan, and whatever else she needs to become complexly independent of her parents and step sister.

She will probably need to go LC/NC and completely separate from her family. \n\nIf she is able to try and help her get a job, and set up a bank account that only has her name on it or possibly be the co-account holder because she\u2019s under 18. \n\nThis is a really sucky situation and skyler deserves to be able to be an autonomous human.", "NTA - it's a hard knock life. Not everyone we love is gonna like us back and better Macey learns this now.", "NTA someone has to be there to speak the truth no one else will", "It sounds like Macey  has been catered to for most of her life and Skyler has been forced to do things she hates.

NTAH.", "NTA. Unless you were very harsh with Macey, all you did was confirm the reality here, that Skyler doesn't want to spend another 4 years attached to Macey and Kacey just needs to deal with it. That is what is going to happen one way or the other, your Brother and SIL can't force Skyler to go to a specific school even if they are paying. She will just drop out or not go at all.", "NTA. You stated some harsh truths that needed to be said.  The \"twins\" act should've been over before it even started; it's been patently unfair to Skyler for a dozen years and now she should be allowed to live her own life. Hopefully, this will give Macey an opportunity to grow as an individual, as well. Not only are you NTA, but you seem to be the only adult who has both girls' best interests at heart.", "Maybe you were harsh, but definitely NTA. Your brother and SIL have probably destroyed any possibility for these 2 to have a normal and healthy sibling relationship. Skyler has been forced to perform like a circus animal to appease her sister and her parents for most of her life. I don't even think the parents of twins usually push this hard. Must go to the same school, same dorm room, live in an apartment together? Jeeeesus. Macey has been allowed to force herself on someone and never allow for their feelings to come into play. This doesn't bode well for her either. That's not how life works in the adult world away from her weird family dynamic. \n\nMacey's parents have set her up for a very awkward future when it comes to relationships. Being unable to read social cues, pushing herself on people who aren't interested in hanging out, etc. And Skyler probably wants to get the hell away from all of them. No one has ever listened to what she wanted. If they didn't force things, it's possible they could have had a decent sibling relationship. Where they cared for each other, but did their own thing. But this? This is a disaster. Thank you for sticking up for your niece.", "They probably ruined any chance of those two ever being able to be close. I feel so bad for Skyler. I\u2019m sure she had to deal with some really hard feelings all on her own growing up. It seems that her birth parent wasn\u2019t really looking out for her best interest, even if she thought she was. You are 100% NTA and it\u2019s sad that this poor girl has had to deal with this. It hurts both of them in the end and the entire family dynamic. I would put money on the fact that Skyler isn\u2019t going to want to go home as much in her free time or visit as often as parents would like their children to well into her 30\u2019s if not for the rest of her life. I think it\u2019s awesome that you stood up and spoke in an honest way. Unfortunately I\u2019ve witnessed situations like this first hand and experienced some of it myself and some people never change or can accept where they may have messed up so everyone else will always be the bad guy so they can \u201cpreserve\u201d themselves and how they think they are seen. God forbid they own up to their mistakes. Too many people lack accountability.", "NTA.  Now please let Skylar know that while she may not be vibing for your side of the family, you\u2019re on her side and ask her if it\u2019s okay for you to keep in touch.

It\u2019d be good for her to know she has at least one family member in her corner.", "You should ABSOLUTELY have a one-on-one talk (in person) with Skyler and tell her that you're there for her and support her decisions, and that you don't approve of how her parents and stepsister have treated her. It would likely be a massive load off of her shoulders to know that there's another person in her corner. Tell her that you don't have any expectations for her to trust you blindly or be close with you, but that you'll be there if and when she needs help or support.", "They're really, really lucky that Skyler is such a stable kid and not as volatile as I was. The shit would have hit the fan at 12/13 if that wasn't the case and it would have been all drama, all the time, lolol. The whole thing is really regrettable not just because of what it did to Skylar, but because the parents virtually ensured that Skyler would never be able to stand Macy as well as teaching Macy that she was the center of the universe.", "Aha. Perhaps that is a point worth adding for Macey - it isn't that she doesn't like her in particular but likely Skyler resents being forced and pushed to hang out with her constantly.. and Skyler associates her with that.\n\nJust a thought.", "I hope that you\u2019ll consider giving Skyler a place to come back to for holidays if she chooses not to celebrate with her family.

You don't mention Macey's interactions with other people at her HS, but it sounds like she may be socially awkward with few friends? Or maybe lonely and always wanted a sister, so pushed herself on Skyler, who probably had plenty of her own friends and just wasn't all that interested.\n\nAgain, you're NTA and I hope you can be a force for good for Skyler-sounds like she needs people like you in her corner.", "But if she is getting push back, she might need help in standing firm.", "I cannot begin to explain just how bad an idea this is, but I\u2019ll try.\n\nMost people *don\u2019t like it when family drags their problems into a very public forum.*\n\nThe only way this will help Skyler is that they\u2019ll be furious with OP and maybe forget they\u2019re mad at her for a minute.", "NTA for what you said but probably the AH for the way you said it. I am really sad that Skyler doesn\u2019t care at all about the step sister she literally grew up with. I feel like Skyler has unresolved issues (mom remarrying) and perhaps the I want to be an only child syndrome (my 6 yr old daughter went through that for awhile when her sister was born) Yes Skyler resented Macey being forced on her as a sister but it looks like the adults didn\u2019t want to face it and instead chose to ignore what may have been fixable at a young age. Unless Macey is a terrible (step) sister she is as much of a victim of the we are one big happy family pretense as Skyler is. Skyler is so full of resentment (understandable) that she may benefit from therapy which may help her understand her feeling towards Macey are more because she wasn\u2019t heard than anything Macey actually did. Skyler has been emotionally punishing the wrong person. With therapy she may even learn how to have a decent or even great relationship with Macey.  Macey should seek therapy too because she seems to truly love Skyler as a sister and the utter rejection she feels can really affect her life moving forward.\nAs for your brother and SIL they need a serious reality check! They seem to be oblivious to the fact that even bio siblings often drift apart and once kids go off to college they are seeking independence and do not want to be tied to a sibling or have a sibling be dependent on them, (which Macey is obviously dependent on Skyler.) To me this is a great family tragedy that could have been avoided if the parents weren\u2019t living in dreamland and addressed the issues between the girls right away. I have empathy for Skyler but my sympathy lies with Macey. It\u2019s got to be heart wrenching to lose a sister and discover she never really had one.", "NTA, it sounds like you're the only person in these girls lives that actually care about their long-term psychological well-being.
