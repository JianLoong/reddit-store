We don't have any kids of our own, not because we can't but because neither of us actually wanted to raise a young child. We usually only foster kids in their mid to late teens. Currently there are two foster kids living with us - a boy (15) and a girl (16), let's call her Abigail. She's only been with us for 3 months but she's very different from all the other kids we fostered. Most teenagers don't really want anything to do with us, which is perfectly normal. But Abigail wanted to spend time with us from the very start. And since I work from home it's usually me she spends time with. \n\nMe and my wife had planned to take Abigail shopping on Tuesday after school. She needed some clothes, a new phone and my wife wanted to get some things for herself and Tuesday is her day off. But on Monday I finished my workload after just 4 hours so when Abigail came home I asked her if she wanted to go out and grab something to eat. Afterwards she  asked me if I could take her shopping just the two of us because she said that my wife can be too \"judgemental\" when it came to clothing choices. So I agreed. But when my wife came home from work and I told her the whole story she got really upset with me for going alone. I told her that I could just take her shopping on Tuesday and we could turn it into a kind of romantic date night afterwards. But she said that she felt betrayed and that I shouldn't have gone with just Abigail. And on Tuesday she refused to go shopping with me.

My uncle had this problem when he and my aunt were fostering. The girl was 17, made up lies about my wife mistreating her, tried to get him to spend one on one time with her, told everyone that my aunt was a bad person. Turns out the social worker hid some info from them : the girl lived with her mom and had lots of stepdads. And some stepdads were nice guys and gave her attention (not in a bad way, they just buy her toys and sweets) and she got attached to them. When she went to live with my uncles, she wanted all that attention from my uncle and tried to push my aunt out of the picture. The social worker begged my aunt to let her stay with them, but my aunt was adamant that she didn't want this girl living in her house after all the lies she spread, so they sent her back. Be careful on how she treats your wife.", "Sorry, but a phone call to your wife giving her a heads up about your change of plans could have saved this situation.  YTA  You had a plan to shop together, it sounds like something your wife was looking forward to.\n\nThis may be completely off the mark, so apologies in advance if if doesn't ring true for you, but Abigail could be developing a crush on you.  You may be the first male she's ever had a positive relationship with and she's young enough to let something like that turn into a fantasy.  \n\nBe clear with her.", "YTA for not at least making a phone call to tell your wife you were changing plans, and for getting yourself into the position of one parent being played against the other. \n\nWith any parenting, but especially with troubled kids, you need to be on the same page. Don't let yourself be flattered into being the 'good guy' parent and leaving your wife stuck in the 'bad guy' role.", "Personally yeah I think that was a bad choice you made. Yall had previous arrangements and you deviated and left your wife out. You've got a little YTA for that. My initial thought is also...be careful.", "INFO: Are you aware of what lead to your foster childs removal? My concern is that 1) it\u2019s what it seems at face value 2) she\u2019s used to men making decisions about her and for her 3) your wife is what she says, judgemental.", "I think YTA for rearranging preset plans on the fly. You should apologize for that. Then you need to figure out why Abigail doesn\u2019t feel comfortable shopping with your wife and help them resolve the issue.", "Maybe NTA, but not smart. Foster kids have learned all sorts of behavior to survive.  We were foster parents too. I would not let my husband do anything like this with a teenage girl.  It is not uncommon to hear about girls attempting blackmail and making false reports to get their way.  Your wife should be the primary caretaker and be present as much as possible to keep you from ending up in that situation. It could be that this foster girl has not had good healthy relationships with females. Your job is to help support her by helping her build a healthy relationship with your wife. Don\u2019t become a manipulation tool.", "YTA mainly because you\u2019re coming to Reddit with foster related issues that so few are understand enough to actually vote on. You need advice from trauma informed foster parents and professionals because as a foster parent you have to parent very, very differently. \n\nThere\u2019s too much that can go into play with a situation like this. Is she attaching to you easier because she\u2019s had unhealthy relationships with men and knows how to manipulate so you feel safer? Is your wife being too hard on her? Does she not trust women? Is she a habitual liar to get her way? This isn\u2019t black and white because you\u2019re not starting with a teen who understands healthy relationships and has grown up with you two. Given that there\u2019s so much that could be behind what seems like a simple request, you need to do better to figure things out. Very rarely does a teen in foster care not have something under the surface that needs to be addressed with just about everything.", "I think you made a bad choice here and may need to be more careful with how you approach fostering. You shouldn\u2019t be acting as a team with the teenager against your wife.", "NTA. A girl that probably has a lot of trust issues confided in you and you did the right thing and provided for her while making her feel comfortable.", "Nta\n\nAll of these comments assuming the foster daughter is manipulative and selfish, or manipulating OP into buying her sexy clothes so she can claim abuse are absolutely disgusting. This girl has done NOTHING to make anyone think that. Seriously, people on here are disgusting.\n\nEdit:spelling", "Your wife felt betrayed because you didn\u2019t stick up for her when someone insulted her in her absence when they called her judgemental. Instead of sticking up for wife or delving into why that person thought it was a good idea to insult her you agreed with them and then even rewarded the insulter by taking them on a shopping trip. \n\nTo top it off, you quite callously told your wife all about your fun day and the reason she\u2019d been left out (after all the one kid that she thought she was hitting it off with actually thinks she\u2019s judgemental, an opinion your actions tell her you agree with) And now you can\u2019t figure out why wifey wasn\u2019t interested in a fun date day with you?", "soft YTA because you could have communicated better to your wife in a way that helped preserve the unique partnership relationship between you and her AND the adult-child relationship between her and Abigail. Also for the reasons other have listed about the nuances of caring for teens with trauma. I don\u2019t know how well your state licensure prepared you for this, but it\u2019s fairly common for them to fail dismally in it so I\u2019m going to point out that attachment parenting and trauma parenting are very different from \u201cnormal\u201d parenting and often seems counterintuitive. I don\u2019t know Abigail or her history, but you probably allowed yourself to be triangulated. Abigail needs you to do more (but not less) than just make her feel comfortable, she needs you to help secure her relationship with both you and your wife and learn healthy relationship strategies. She feels judged by your wife? Awesome opportunity for you to facilitate reconnection and communication instead of alienation. Maybe your wife is judging and needs to grow. Maybe Abigail is too sensitive and needs to feel accepted. Maybe they just are speaking different languages! But if Abigail sees self reflection and connection modeled for her, and gains another trusted adult as a result of her honesty, that\u2019s a win. Shopping was a lateral move. \n\nIf you don\u2019t have an attachment and trauma focused therapist for her, it would be good to identify that as a need to her CW. But honestly, even if nothing in Abigail\u2019s case plan changes, you can find an attachment focused couples therapist for you and your wife, and it will be the best thing you can possibly do for yourselves and for Abigail. \n\nSide note, here was my biggest red flag: you said Abigail was different than the others and then your suggested solution to wife was for you and her to go shopping as a date. That tells me either your or her primary concern wasn\u2019t that wife missed a chance to bond w Abigail but that Abigail somehow affected your relationship with wife. That could be a lot of things, but it needs to be explored ASAP. The last thing Abigail needs is a home situation where the adults aren\u2019t able to give her the safety, stability, and consistency she needs because their relationship is rocky or they\u2019re looking for validation from a teen. I echo the caution against being \u201cgood parent\u201d because it\u2019s self serving and won\u2019t be able to recognize Abigail\u2019s deeper needs and meet them appropriately.", "NTA, she confined in you that she found safety in your presence and was brave in expressing that she\u2019s not totally comfortable around her other foster parent. IMO, you did the right thing taking her out for 1:1 time because she ASKED you for\nthat. If your wife feels \u201cbetrayed\u201d, tell her that fostering teens isn\u2019t about her and it\u2019s not the end of the world. Keep up the good work.", "Maybe she enjoys taking her shopping, having a bond. The shopping could have been a \"big deal\" to her psychologically? Or maybe she is jealous of her.... You should try and get down to the bottom of why she was acting like that. Y'all could have done half the shopping Monday and the rest Tuesday i don't think you're the asshole though.", "NTA for the title but imo that\u2019s misleading. You are TA for changing plans without talking to your wife first", "Gently YTA\n\nIf you've agreed on a plan as a married couple, you should stick to that plan. Any deviations should be discussed before it happens. Also, be cautious of the relationship you build with your foster daughter and remember to have boundaries. I don't think that she is deliberately trying to come between you and your wife, but I have definitely seen kids pin parents against each other to gain more leverage. This is obviously one incident, so it could just be a one-time thing, but her comment on your wife is a little red flag. Not big enough to be a problem, but keep in mind that she has said that.", "NTA - It's not really clear why your wife is reacting negatively.  Is she jealous of time that you spent with a foster kid.  If so that's very toxic.  Is it because she feels like she lost an opportunity to bond?", "NTA The fact that Abigail thinks that your wife is judgemental is concerning and you should have a conversation with your wife and get to the bottom of this issue...something feels off.\n\nI would have thanked my husband for taking her and basically freeing up my day off so that we could have a date night.", "NTA. If Abigail doesn't feel comfortable shopping with your wife, she shouldn't have to. Teens are vulnerable and it's important to listen to them when they are trying to protect their fragile sense of self.\n\nAnyway, your wife should thank you for taking one more errand off her plate. I don't see why this is a big issue.", "NTA\n\nAbigail asked for it to just be the two of you shopping and you complied, no real harm done.\n\nI get that your wife may feel left out, but you really need to get to the bottom of the \u2018judgemental\u2019 comment. It\u2019s rather telling.", "YTA. It dissed ur wife. Now Abigail will likely play both ends against the middle. Prolly should follow up on the \"judgemental\" thing. All best.", "NTA and sucks that life can be this way but it's possible that your wife is worried about the appearance of impropriety.   Maybe it's not so appropriate for a 16 year old girl to separate you from your plans already made with your wife.  idk.", "Yta - you just gave in instead of having a serious talk with your wife & Abigail about why she's feeling judged about clothes.", "Mmm, I'll go with NTA, the girl feels safe around you and that's a good, even with blood relatives that's a thing so no one can judge for that, that being said what you did falls in the category of \"good things that seem to be bad\", you should totally discuss this things with your wife, maybe tellling her you were going to take abigail to shop would have avoided the trouble.", "NTA.\n\nBut I think your wife was looking forward to that girls-go-shopping-event a bit more than you would've thought. And getting now the \"leftover\" shopping is just not the same for her. \n\nMaybe she also felt something is off. I think the comment Abigail made means someting.

The social worker had hid some things about the girl to them and when things went south, tried to guilt them into keeping the girl, but they refused to do it.", "That's why in my judgement i told him to investigate. It could be nothing, but it could be something important.\n\n>I have a family member who had a similar experience with a younger child and they worked through it.\n\nIn my uncle case it wasn't possible. The damage caused was too extensive.", "I'm a bit shocked that he's so stupid as to have dinner alone with girl he barely knows. Such poor judgment!", "Ooops! Thanks for the correction!\n\nYou are right, OP should have kept the dinner offer open because that's a nice little surprise (but like where is the other kid during all this? Is he just sequestered to his room 24/7?) and discussed the judgment remark but retained the original shopping plan.", "The plans for the child included both parents. This is an opportunity for both parents to bond with the child. You will also notice that he said she hasn't been with them for long, and she's acted differently from every foster child they have had, so its important that the mom is there for these things. Planning and structure are very important, especially when fostering teens. I'll say that parenting doesn't really go as well when the parents are not on the same page, and if they discussed how the shopping should go beforehand than thats how it should go. Just because she got supplies doesn't mean that she is well taken care of. If this causes tension between the parents, then that's not good either.", "It can be different in fostering situations. The trauma that so many of the kids in the system experience can create really unhealthy survival mechanisms. \"Divide and conquer\" is fairly basic and common; one of the first things kids learn is that if there are two parents or guardians in the picture is that they can pit one against the other for their (the child's) own gain in some way. That doesn't make them awful kids or anything like that but it is a behavior pattern to pay attention to and it's one that should be curbed.", "It's not their child.  It is a non-related teenage girl who quite possibly had to spend her formative years coping with unhealthy male/female relationships.  The likeliest result is she attempts to play one against the other.  The unlikely, but still possible result is she attempts to use false accusations to blackmail the family.", "They made a plan for all three of them which he changed on the spur of the moment without telling her. It was a bad move.", "I\u2019m pretty sure the \u201cit\u201d is referring to the event.", "I sure hope it was a typo. Otherwise that's disturbing.", "Wait, what? Has that been elaborated on? Because if all we have is that Abigail feels \"judged\" that doesn't mean he bought her naughty clothing! I mean, Abigail could have taken offense to the FM's style of shopping, maybe FM just wants to know her sizes so they can grab and go. It could have just been an offhanded \"yellow washes you out, the blue would make your eyes pop.\" Unless there's a more specific context, that seems like a reach.", "As is dinner alone with a child he barely knows. That cuts both ways, she could accuse him, he could be manipulating her.", "Raising teen girls that was my first thought too. If they want something I'd not allow they'd be heading to talk their dad into it...he fell for it more than once!!", "The fact this girl so interested in spending time with him - contrary to the other teen - should b\u00e9 a red flag instead of a pleasant surprise. And it's not the teen fault. Some have been through such awfull stuff. They need to keep a routine and work hand in hand at all Time. He's a educator not a Friend. If she Sees she Can manipulate him and play one against the other, it's done. He should have taken his wife defense.saying it's for your own good. Not feel flattered that she prefers him. The truth may be that he IS easier to manipulate.", "She\u2019s lived with them for three months", "I wondered about the other kid too.", "I SAID OP's wife could be a prude, however, OP shouldn't be taking her shopping alone w/o consulting w/ his wife. If the wife IS actualy too judgemental, then they need to work it out like adults, not go behind her back. \n\n\"Naughty Clothes\" yeesh.", "Either way he is telling his wife her time and opinions don't matter", ">If she Sees she Can manipulate him and play one against the other, it's done. He should have taken his wife defense\n\nI agree", "That's not a long time though."]}
