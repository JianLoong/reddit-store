Throughout most of our relationship we always used the withdrawal method. Yes it always technically worked because whenever we weren\u2019t trying to get pregnant, I did not get pregnant. And as soon as we stopped withdrawing, I did get pregnant. \n\nBut now we are done having kids. I have always wanted only two kids, and I am completely content with our two boys. Not to mention, we are financially strapped and live paycheck to paycheck. Also, our relationship has not been great the past couple years and my husband refuses couples therapy, so why would I be irresponsible enough to risk getting pregnant when we are possibly headed for a divorce in the near future if things don\u2019t change between us? \n\nI can\u2019t go on any synthetic birth control, as it messes up my entire system/body and gives me heart palpitations and anxiety attacks. My husband refuses to get a vasectomy (he cringes every time I mention it and says he\u2019ll never get one, I think he\u2019s afraid to get it done. Either that or he thinks it\u2019ll make him less of a man or some crazy idea like that.) So I told him I wanted us to use condoms, and he agreed, but then proceeded to pressure me into unprotected sex every single time. A few months ago I gave in and we had unprotected sex, a few weeks later my period was 16 days late! I went into a brief depression for a couple weeks, thinking that I accidentally got pregnant again, feeling like the worst mother in the world for letting that happen and being irresponsible. Then I got my period late. \n\nI sat my husband down one night and very calmly explained to him that we can no longer have unprotected sex again and that he needs to wear a condom so that I don\u2019t have to go through that kind of stress again, and because it is my body and my choice. (I\u2019m the one that would be growing the baby, going through labor, birthing it and taking care of it 90% of the time). He agreed. \n\n\u2026since then he has not bought a box of condoms, we have not had sex in two months, and he pretty much refuses to have sex with a condom, and frequently tells me how ridiculous I\u2019m being for thinking that he should. If he knows I\u2019m about to get my period, he always says \u201cWe can do it raw tonight because there\u2019s no way you can get pregnant right now if you\u2019re about to get your period. So there\u2019s no reason you shouldn\u2019t be able to do that\u2026.\u201d And when I refuse, he acts so childish and moody and basically stonewalls me or ignores me the rest of the night and pouts on the couch watching tv, as if I\u2019m being mean to him. Or he\u2019ll say things like \u201cIt\u2019s ok, I get it, you just don\u2019t want to have sex with me\u2026\u201d and then walks in the other room. \n\nAITA?? Should I be letting him have sex with me without a condom \u201cevery once in a while\u201d to please him? Should I be letting him have that one or two days a month when Im 99% sure I\u2019m not ovulating, as a \u201cspecial treat\u201d like he calls it? Am I being selfish? Or is he just being stubborn?

Get therapy for yourself at the very least, and talk to your healthcare provider about contraception. \n\nAs to the topic of contraception you have many more options than condoms, the pill or a vasectomy. These range from: \n\n1. non-permanent devices like diaphragms, spermicide, female condoms (if available where you live). These are not 100% effective but better than the withdrawal method. They can be a bit awkward to use but don\u2019t require him to do or agree to anything. Having said that, he strikes me as the sort of man who would take great offence should he discover that you are using these methods without his \u201capproval\u201d. \n\n2. A longer term option is: an IUD, such as a Mirena, inserted into your uterus to disrupt the lining and prevent implantation of a placenta. There are hormonal and purely mechanical IUD\u2019s. You can discuss which will be best for you with your gynaecologist. The good thing about these is they are also commonly used to control heavy or painful periods so you could pass it off as treatment for \u201clady problems\u201d. These are extremely effective (>99%) and last up to 5 years. However, they can cause pain in the first few months and can be dislodged. _They should always be inserted under anaesthetic_ \n\n3) The permanent option is tubal ligation. Getting your tubes tied will be >99% effective at preventing pregnancy and can\u2019t be reversed. It\u2019s more serious a surgery than a vasectomy but it\u2019s not a hysterectomy\u2026 \n\nLastly, in case he missed Sex Ed 101, you 100% can get pregnant on your period. There are no \u201cone or two days\u201d in your cycle where you can be 100% certain you won\u2019t get pregnant. The only way to 100% prevent pregnancy when both parties are reproductively intact is abstinence. \n\nGood luck, OP. Don\u2019t let him wear you down. You are not his brood mare or sex slave. You owe him nothing. If he doesn\u2019t want to get the snip, fine, but the consequence of _his_ decision is no sex until you have a contraceptive in place that you are happy with.\n\nEDIT: words", "NTA. My wife and I had the same talk about trying one more time for a girl (2 boys also) and we were also struggling to afford the two we had. She had similar medical issues so I got snipped and it\u2019s never been a problem. It\u2019s also reversible.\n\nAn alternative if it\u2019s something you get pleasure from is him starting PIV with a condom and finishing anally without one.", "You are 100% correct to not risk having another child with him. He wants an image in his head of two boys and a sweet little daddy's girl to make him feel like a big man. He's counting on you to handle the actual reality of raising three kids. If he has always dreamed of a big family and wanted to make it happen with you, he would be talking with you about the changes that would need to be made by everyone for that to work. But he's not about the reality and taking responsibility, he's about getting what he wants no matter how it affects other people.", "In his mind, it\u2019s a you problem unfortunately. this sounds like one of many, many problems. In fact its so far down the list of issues, you would need James Cameron\u2019s sub to go deep enough to find it.", "Just to attempt to walk in his shoes for a moment - does he think that not having sex at all is \"more manly\" than getting a vasectomy and satisfying your conditions for unprotected sex?", "It's great that you are at least aware of this! Stay strong, and always do what's best for you.", "Good to hear you're a strong person, sounds like you need will need that in your relationship, because he is manipulating you in this manner. Also, sounds like you've done quite everything to make this work. I can't believe some people are and act like this. I'm so sorry. Are there any shared friends which you both share your lives with and could talk this over? He should not need it, but maybe he needs a kick in the but from a friend? Wish you all the best, and please, don't let him abuse you like this. These are strong words, but if the partner in life you're most committed to nearly sinks in depression by the guilt and the idea of unwanted pregnancy, how can you ignore that and force a feeling of guilt? I've no other words for that. Stay strong!", "As a child from a divorced household, (my personal opinion), I'd rather my parents be separated and living their lives the way they want/need than parents who suffer together for my sake. Not to push you in that direction, but just to offer that you shouldn't lose yourself in the fight to keep your household together. I wish you the absolute best of luck, and hope you make the decisions that you feel are best for your body, family, and future.", "That's what I did. I birthed two kids. He can get a vasectomy. And he did.", "She should know her options. It doesn\u2019t sound like she does.", "I'm just saying if I was in the husband's position, I'd get snipped because there wouldn't be any sex otherwise (unless I maybe tried Viagra, but I'm generally opposed to medications unless absolutely necessary). He's been presented with options by OP. He's just choosing to be a baby about it.", "It\u2019s valid, but you couldn\u2019t actually know.", "I\u2019ve had the procedure it takes like 30 mins, your awake and it\u2019s just uncomfortable. I could have actually went to work next day and did after the weekend. I had no pain what so ever it\u2019s not a big deal", "OP is there a man in your life you can trust to talk to him about getting a vasectomy? From your post he reads like the sort of guy who won\u2019t hear it from you, or any other woman for that matter, but might be receptive to hearing it from a man he respects. \n\nOf course, if he\u2019s going to give you a hard time about it if he thinks you engineered the situation please don\u2019t say anything. You need to stay safe. But, if there happens to be someone who would be willing to help and can be trusted not to throw you under the bus\u2026 \n\nIf he\u2019s just scared or holding on to stupid hang ups about his manhood, it might be enough to get him to reconsider.", "My wife had her tubes tied before we met, she said it\u2019s at most two hours, and go home.  It was an out patient procedure.", "Thank you for your thoughtful and informative response \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc9c You are 100% right.", "If I still had coins, I\u2019d spend it on an award for this comment.

And that\u2019s definitely a perspective I consider a lot. I have a lot to think about.", "Sounds like an intelligent, wise,  caring, loving person as in healthy marriage it should be.", "I think she does since she already knows she can't take hormonal birth control. But there's a lot more going on here than a disagreement about birth control, and that's the bigger issue.", "I used to use a diaphragm. I would\u2019ve never used it without a condom or vice versa. Neither is so close to foolproof that they should be used alone if you don\u2019t want to get pregnant."]}
