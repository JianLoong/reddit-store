Did he give you any money or wedding gifts?", "ESH. If it were me and you gave me a book of instructions I probably wouldn\u2019t have read it either. It sounds like you had a case of the bridezillas and it frightened everyone away. They should have been more thoughtful and you need to lighten up IMO", "NTA send a Venmo request to your mom & sister for the late fees.", "No wonder you\u2019re the least favorite", "ESH.\n\nAs a punctual person, this would drive me crazy to have people show up that late to something. \n\nBut you also sound like a bit of a bridezilla here.  Laminated books about the schedule?  The \"ITS MY WEDDING DAY!\".  Like it sounds like you are more mad at him for not shit talking your mom and sister, than you are for them being late.  \n\nMaybe the way you act has something to do with them not wanting to show up early and being super stressed out.", "He also rolled up past noon, he just wasn't included in the makeup and hair.", "I don't have many friends: I moved states away just before the 'rona and it really hampered my social life.  So my bridal party was my friend and my 2 sisters. My friend stayed the night at my place but decided they didn't want to ride with us and then got high and fell asleep. That's why they were late.\n\nI was getting my hair and makeup done. My fiance was trying to track them down but they weren't answering", "To be fair, I also paid for the hair and makeup. I thought it would be nice and fun for us to all get professionally made up together, so I took a job to earn enough money to pay for me and groom, the mom's, the 3 bridal party and the flower girl.", "Ceremony was at 4. Sunset is at 5. I was trying to get pictures done in the light and before the dinner and party time. We only took pictures with the grooms side because mine wasn't ready on time", "When my mom's dad died, he left money for our weddings. My dad distributed this money after keeping it in his own investment accounts. \n\nHe did not pay the fee or give a gift.", "She doesn't need to be sorry for being excited and it doesn't make her an ahole either. \n\nAnd you wouldn't even scroll through a few pages for your kids wedding? Ouch. That is like.. no effort at all", "That's not helpful, thank you for your input though.", "Everyone (15+ people) kept texting and messaging and asking me about all the details. So I wrote them down as a reference. This was the first time the two families had met, and my in-laws wanted to be helpful and know all the stuff that needed doing. The schedule was stuff like: 11:00 arrive 1:00 pictures 4:00 ceremony 6:00 dinner. The tasks were things like \"put the confetti out, put table numbers out, place flowers around\"", "..... being excited is nothing to be ashamed of... \n\n\nThis is a stellar example of victiming blaming.", "You should have just denied their hair and makeup. Keep your distance from that trash. You will only get respect if you respect yourself. Your family doesn\u2019t respect you and that is why they bulldoze over you.\n\nYou are married now. Enjoy it with your husband and build a healthy family with him.", "In that case, he didn\u2019t need to be there before noon anyway. He would have just been standing around. \n\nSee\u2026 now you\u2019re starting to stray into asshole territory a bit. I still think your family is the problem, but expecting someone to stand around for four hours for no good reason is more than a little bit controlling.", "So that is a new detail. Your husband was trying to get in touch with them and they didn't respond. This means not attending was very intentional. It's time to go low contact and let them wonder why. I'm petty and from here on out I would intentionally be late for anything involving them.", "That really sucks they did that to you.", "YTA.", "It was 7 pages. 4 of pictures of everyone with their name and \"title\" ie \"Name: bride's sister, bridesmaid. ring bearer's mom. Daughter of brides parents.\"\n\nOne page had the line-up order, one page had the schedule, one had the pictures that other people requested we take, and one had the list of little stuff that needed doing.\n\n Each family really only needed half the pictures because they knew themselves, but it was easier to make them all the same. I handed them out at rehearsal dinner and briefly went through the last 4 pages with everyone to keep everyone informed and on the same level. Nobody had a problem with anything in the book, and several people were glad to have all the information they could possibly need in one place. I know it was extra, but it wasn't an obligation. More of a resource.", "You kind of sound like Leslie Knope with all her binders.  And while its nice to be organized, that kind of thing can easily turn into feeling excessive.  AGain, you called it a laminated book.  That is a lot.", "The way you express your excitement can rub people the wrong way.  I'm just saying, its very possible that it happened here.  \n\nNo one is saying she shouldn't be excited on her wedding day, but that doesn't mean other people may not find her to be a bridezilla", "Oh yeah, the husband parts were great. My FIL gave us a couple nights in a hotel room and we're just laying around and going to museums and having fun.", "Um how .. he was literally still late if everything started at a certain time. She clearly states that they were super early for her other two sisters weddings", "I had a lot of little stuff to get done that everyone agreed to do at the rehearsal dinner. So them being late meant I had to get the venue ready after hair and makeup. The groomsmen and in laws were amazing and really picked up the family slack, but I wanted to not be alone. I'm sorry that you think keeping someone company is not a good reason to show up for them.", "You don't need to justify yourself to me. As said, in my opinion you aren't the ahole for being excited (or prepared).", "I have a book binding machine and it has plastic sheets to act as the cover. There were several very small kids at the rehearsal and spill happen. Idk bro", "I appreciate that. It ended up being one of the worst days of my life. I always pictured my mom and sisters and best friend being with me as I got ready, but instead I was alone. Then I had to run around like crazy to do the stuff they told me they'd do before the wedding while they were getting ready.", "Ok, that is fine.  I feel like you are focusing on a very small portion of what I said.  Whether or not you feel the book was over the top, the way you describe things makes you sound like A LOT.  You already have a chip on your shoulder for feeling like you are the least favorite child, you directed your anger at your dad when it sounds like you were really mad at the actions of others, its just overall a lot.  I'm just suggesting stepping out of yourself and looking at it from the outside.", "I would send them the bill for the additional charges, and make it clear you will take them to small claims if they don't pay up. \n\nThen cut all contact", "NTA if it is only money then send him a bill for their late fees.", "NTA and I am so sorry this happened to you, and congratulations on your wedding", "NTA you told them when to get there THEY choose to kitten to sister instead and be 2 hours late costing you extra if I had cost th3 brid a late charge I would be so embarrassed and pay it myself", "If it's just money tell your father to pay for it, what a shit show.

You deserve so much more than that.", "NTA  Now you are the important one in someone's life.  Embrace that.", "ESH \n\nOf course it sucks that your family was late and cost you extra money on top of it, but honestly you sound super Bridezilla level over the top controlling with your \u201cpreparations\u201d. If anyone would invite me to their wedding and handed me out an \u201cinstruction booklet\u201d for what to do and how to act that day, you better believe that I suddenly had the flu and could not attend.

My dad's job was to distribute the labeled  envelopes with tips in them to the vendors.\n\n I didn't need photographic evidence that my dad handed an envelope to a lady. I did need to know that it was assigned to someone who'd agreed to handle it so it wouldn't fall through the cracks.

Our wedding day coordinator had the list and walked around checking things off as they were done. \n\nI have narcolepsy and my biggest cataplexy trigger is stress. I ended up passing out once or twice because people broke their promises. My vendors did not get their tips.

I was basing my comment upon my own various pre-wedding observations, in which brides often completely ignore their fathers until the few minutes surrounding the \u201cwalk down the aisle\u201d.
