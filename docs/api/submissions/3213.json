Learn how to \"grey rock\", that is answering question with bland, non-committal answers.\n\n\"Did you like dinner\"?  \"It was fine\"\n\n\"When will you have us over for dinner\"? \"Work is very busy, I'll let you when I'm free\".\n\n\"Do you want to be a bridesmaid for sisters wedding\"?  \"I have so much going on, I don't have time that she needs to do a good job\".\n\nIt sounds like you're used to being their punching bag.  But do you want this for the next 50 years, for you, husband and (future) kids?", "Your sister is an AH and you should have told the makeup ppl to leave \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2640\ufe0f as long as you look good who cares. \n\nNta", "NTA, this is so hurtful and inconsiderate. I\u2019m so sorry you had to deal with this on a day you\u2019ll remember forever.", "NTA! you did NOTHING wrong.", "NTA\n\nFocus on your new chosen family. They showed you how  much they love and value you at your wedding. Do yourself the favour and cut them out of your life, go to therapy to move past the hurt they've caused and go get the best revenge ever - live the happiest life ever! You deserve that.", "NTA but I don't think you should've yelled. I understand tho....i just find yelling very disrespectful...I don't even yell at my kids and definitely not other adults.... but mange no mistake, I understand why it happened.", "NTA.  I believe that youngest sister is on the hook for the late fees.  Send her a bill.", "NTA..  Everyone knows, or should at least have some inkling, of how much preparation and planning goes into a wedding.  When you are part of the Bridal Party and on the list of people who need to get made up or dressed for the ceremony, then you show up when you are scheduled to show up.  It's like a call sheet for when they make a film or tv show.  A wedding, if you will pardon the oversimplification, in a lot of ways is a 'show'.  There is a call sheet, wardrobe, make-up, catering, sets (venue)..  A lot of parallels here...  \n\nThat said, your Mother was given plenty of notice that she had to show up at X time to be made up.  She didn't, and in my humble opinion, is responsible for every penny of the late fees the Makeup Artist charged.", "NTA. Sounds like your sister sabotaged you on purpose and your dad is an AH. You whole family is AH.  Take this as the final sign and put a lot of distance between you and your AH family.  Life is too short to live it being treated this badly.", "NTA! I hope the rest of your wedding went well and you had a wonderful day.", "NTA.\n\nOP, give yourself the gift of sanity and put some distance between you and the folks who treat you poorly. \n\nYou deserve the best.\n\nPS - congratulations on the wedding!", "I'm really confused about OP because their comments from 18 days ago say they're no contact with their parents.", "Nice friend.  Get some new ones.", "My mom and sister were with me the whole time before the wedding. Your bridal party\u2019s entire reason for existing is to \u201ckeep you company\u201d and assist you before and during your wedding.", "Oh, for sure. Plus, I have to wonder if OPs shitty family made her need strict, clear schedules by being, your know, shit, consistently over the years.\n\nI also don't work well without schedules, lol. I just hate them \ud83e\udd23", "No, time to go full contact with family...The in-laws! You know, the ones who showed up TO HER WEDDING.", "Nta. Your family sounds like they all suck though.", "NTA.  If it's \"just money\" he can surely pony up the dough, right?  Oh, it's not about being rational is it?\n\nAnd you said to be there at 11.  Why on _earth_ would they listen to your sister over you?  Let me guess -- she's the favorite?", "INFO: you said in the past that you \u201cmoved several states away and don\u2019t talk to my family at all\u201d so did you talk to them or remind them about times at all? I just wonder about communication. Is there any or did you just mail them some laminated schedule?", "Holy shit!  A bride story where the bride is NTA!!!  Well done!  Also, your family are dicks.", "NTA.  You should have dismissed the makeup team at the prearranged time and when family showed late simply told them they were on their own.  They were intentionally rude and dismiss of your schedule.  Send your dad a bill for the extra.", "NTA. You were abundantly clear what time to be there and they failed to show. It's understandable you'd be upset, especially since they didn't seem to care that they were late. if your youngest sister did tell them a later time, then she is also an AH but your parents should have gone with the clear time you told them or double checked with you about the time instead of listening to someone who wasn't the bride.", "If everything is exactly as you described NTA - I have a feeling there\u2019s more to the story.", "NTA- I would have the hair and makeup people go and screw your family if they didn't look good.", "I would have told the make up artist to go.\n\nThen they could have done their own make up.\n\nNTA", "OP=NTA\n\nThis could very much be a sister problem(trying to steal attention from you) or it could have been that she took that long for your hair/makeup and thought you would too.  \n\nHowever, you asked them to be there at a set time and wanted them with you and it unless they were paying the late fee, should not have been late.\n\nI'm sure this isn't your only evidence of favoritism, and your father's concern for the staff overhearing is even more immature than being upset on your wedding day when you are already stressed.  Just not showing up for 2 hours on sister's say so is a bit much.  If they believed they weren't needed they could have called/texted.", "Because I hadn't spoken to them until they told me the money was dependent on them being involved. I don't speak to my dad in general because he says I'm too depressing and he used to dread coming home because he knew he'd have to talk to me. I moved from MD to Ohio and haven't spoken to him outside of exchanging \"happy holiday\" texts in years. This is this first time they've ever visited me. It's easiest to describe it as \"I don't talk to him\"\n\nMy sister is married to an abusive cop and I hate him, so I don't talk to him. She does everything he tells her to do, and he doesn't like me either because I'm a godless heathen who told him he's not allowed to carry a gun into my home.", "She was also 32, not 28.", "1. The schedule said that the makeup person was arriving at 10 and the photographer would be there at 11. \n\n2. That person isn't my friend anymore, they live far away and I'm done with the friendship. I was absolutely furious with them, especially considering they were transporting the decorations. \n\n3. Photos were supposed to be me and hubby at 1, then the rest of the bridal party at 2:30. Ceremony started at 4. \n\n4. I was all alone by myself on my wedding day when everyone had told me they'd be there. I was incredibly hurt, and on top of that it cost me money. When I think about my wedding day, I think about how sad I was sitting in the chair trying to not cry and mess up the work the person was doing. Nobody else I know has memories like that from their day.", "They'd each individually texted me about outfits and timing and other details. I replied to them all, then looked through what people asked and put all that information together. like when the makeup artists and photographer would get there, when group pics would start, when the ceremony would start, and when dinner would start. I handed them out when we had the rehearsal dinner the night before and just told people the different sections. Then I went around and talked to the people who had special jobs, like the tips and the confetti and the stomp glasses. They get very stressful around Occasions.", "You didn't like having a list of who everyone was and the group poses they wanted?", "Reddit archaeology at work lol", "She said \"not much contact\", and not \"no contact at all\":\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yoa7t2/aita_for_not_letting_my_daughter_have_locks_for/ivea5rq?\n\n>\"I am 32 and I do not have much contact with my parents\"", "But you weren\u2019t alone all day they got there at noon. Why didn\u2019t you sleep in, enjoy the make up and have some coffee? Seems like you\u2019re being dramatic. Also saw you call the guy who paid for the wedding your \u201cstupid grandpa\u201d. Gonna go with YTA", "No, I just decided we aren't friends anymore. They don't live in the same state as me and this was my last straw. Harder to toss away your mom though.", "My stupid grandpa believed he was never going to die and never wrote anything down. He'd just told my mom he had a wedding fund for us 3, and how much was for each. When he died she found an account with exactly that amount separate from the rest of his money. Dad took over from there", "Why can't she dramatic for one day, it her wedding day, a day which is special for her and she is allowed to be dramatic and call people stupid who come late by 2 HOURS....", "You\u2019re NTA. That guy sounds like he\u2019d disrespect his daughter\u2019s wedding day, too. If he hasn\u2019t already. \n\nI\u2019m glad your chosen family is nicer.", "I understand that, but was your father there, right beside you, when you did hair and makeup, got dressed, etc? I\u2019m sincerely asking since so many people have taken exception with my assertion that the father of the bride is often sitting around doing nothing while such preparation are underway for the bride and bridesmaids.", "My in-laws decided that no one gets married at 7 p.m. on a Friday night, so they decided to show up at 7:20, positive that the wedding would begin after 7:30.\n\nMiddle brother-in-law told them to recheck their invitation. They ignored him.\n\nMy husband had to run half-way down the aisle to grab them so they could walk to the back and process in with the rest of us. Hubby is NOT a quiet runner and he had raised his voice, so the almost 100 people in the church turned around to see what the ruckus was. \n\nIn-laws had frowns on their faces for the rest of the night. Not sure why since we waited for them over twenty minutes and did not start without them.\n\nFamilies who pull crap for weddings deserve to stay on the naughty list.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA but like. Why even invite these people?", "YTA. You don\u2019t talk to your family at all and then expect them to revolve around your schedule.", "ugh!  family!!!  \ud83e\udd2ci am so sorry your family treats you like my family treats me. most people think i am my mother\u2019s accountant or attorney. when i told the salesman at the car dealership i was her daughter, he said, \u201coh. i\u2019m sorry, the way she talks to you, i thought you were \u201cthe help\u201d.  as the oldest, go low-contact now before you get the \u201cit is your duty to serve the family\u201d speech. i am 52 and the family concierge. get out now.", "NTA. Your family let you down badly. But I'm wondering why? I sense that there is more back story. You say that you were your father's least favourite but how does this account for your mother's and sisters' behaviour?\n\nI am sorry that you had such a stressful time and such an unhappy day.  You put such a lot of forethought and meticulous preparation in to make this a happy day for everyone.\n\nI hope you will be very happy on your marriage from now on and wish you every blessing.\n\nEDIT. Having read some of your comments, I'm wondering why it was necessary for people to arrive by 10 for a ceremony at 4. The make up would not be great after that time interval.  Is it because they live far away and most of the practical preparations were being done with family help on the day?\nAlso, knowing what your family is like, was it realistic to expect them to cooperate in a way that was necessary for your wedding day to be the success that you hoped for?", "NTA, but make your dad read this thread.", "My dad is like this. I had to tell him my 3pm wedding was at 1pm. And so we got him out the house and to the venue by about 1.30pm\ud83d\ude44 And then he proceeded to complain about having to sit around and wait. Love him immensely, but can be a ridiculous man. Fortunately my sister and mum aren't like that at all. And so they helped with the trickery.", "Next time, just send the makeup team home. \u201cOh you guys are here! Too bad you missed makeup. But that\u2019s ok. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll look lovely. Here\u2019s the change room.\u201d", "YTA for being a bridezilla. Assigned tasks? Instructions? Lousy way to treat friends! It is not a treat to work your wedding! Hire a wedding planner instead of turning your bridesmaids into bride\u2019s MAIDS and making them work your party.", "LOL NTA and dad can hold his breath waiting for your apology. Since they are late by nature, they won't mind waiting for you to actually NOT apologize for being upset about being treated less than on YOUR day.  I hope you have distanced yourself from them?!", "NTA I\u2019m sorry but your family doesn\u2019t seem to love you.\n\nFocus on your new family that you and your spouse have created by getting married.  Put all your emotional energy into that and cut off your dead weight.", "This one, yes no more total NC", "If i knew what would happen i would have said to the make up artist to go home after your make up was done. They do not deserve it. I would ask for your sister to pay for the extra fees. It is you wedding, your special dag. You do not deserve it. So nta", "Nta. Send them this post so they can read through the comments. Glad you got to yell at somebody.", "NTA. To hell with them. For real, I've never been late to a wedding I'm involved in, and I'm late to most of my life.", "Nta but jfc when are y'all gonna stop with all these expensive, stressful, waste of money weddings? Does anybody have a good experience? I knew from a young age that I never wanted to stand in front of everyone I know and some ppl I don't, wearing a silly frilly dress pretending to be a princess. I always said I'd rather get married at a courthouse, without an audience, and spend that money on real life and that's what I did.", "YTA.\n\nFamily decided to mess with control freak bridezilla. Succeeded. Good for them.", "Looks like we found the family!", "Maybe this is why I'm struggling with this one. Our goal was for zero people to have to work. I felt guilty that someone had to put the floral thing on the arch because we didn't hit the minimum for the florist to deliver and set up flowers. It was the ONLY task anyone had to do the entire day. Everything else we paid people to do when it came to setting up and tearing down. And we only had 25 people invited. \n\nAnd it sounds like everyone was tasked with all this stuff the night before at the rehearsal dinner.", "And now you know why. Good decision OP.", "Deny their hair and makeup? You think the bride  was paying for hair and makeup as a favor to THEM?  That was so she had nice pictures. Denying them hair and makeup would be denying herself her pictures.", "Did you not have a rehearsal and rehearsal dinner where all those people met beforehand?", "Yeah, let them fend for themselves. It's only important pictures that you're going to hang on your wall forever, who cares if everyone looks trash. Dude, she wasn't paying for hair and makeup as a favor to THEM. She was paying for hair and makeup to get nice pictures.", "Okay so your mom is TA here. If he didn't write anything down and there wasn't a will, it would have gone to next of kin. If your mom knew what the money was for and was the one who received it, apparently tly she ignored that and gave it to your dad instead.", "Lol.\nI would have sent the makeup people away, and just went on with the wedding without them.\n\nNTA\n\n(On the other hand. No wedding will ever happen for me)", "I would be loosing it much more than just yelling at dad. How they even dare ffs!", "I would have sent the makeup and hair stylist home and they could do their own. That\u2019s just plain rude.\n\nNTA", "NTA I wouldve said he was an embarrassment of a father since ehe didn't do that for your sisters weddings. Honestly in any other kind of situation where you oay for make up, send the make up people home, if they wanna be under prepared they can be under presented", "I've never been able to get much attention because I was \"so mature for my age\" and was \"so easy nobody had to do anything for me\" whereas my younger sisters are very demanding and needy. So I was really hoping for a day where I was the middle of the attention. I wanted a day about me.", "My wedding photographer asked for a shot list.  I don\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t want one.", "My sister's husband runs on \"Tim time.\" Luckily for him he's an amazing guy, husband, bil, dad. We just always allow 30 minutes when he has to get pretty, even though his hair is a cm long.", "This is a pretty old account; I was in fact 28. For like a whole year!", "Next time for what? How many weddings is she having?", "It was stupid of him to have money he wanted specific things done with and to not write it down. I loved him and miss him, but that doesn't mean he made good choices with regards to a future without him.", "You got it in one! They tend to stand around doing nothing until the last minute, then they rush around snapping at people because they didn't plan.", "They met at the rehearsal dinner the night before, when I gave them all the info. I don't live near them and they all traveled up to my state.", "No response but more downvotes. I guess that answers the question pretty definitively."]}
