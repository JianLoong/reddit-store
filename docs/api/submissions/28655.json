We had been trying for about a year after she had experienced a miscarriage of a pregnancy that we hadn't planned. We are both obviously super happy and excited to become parents.\n\nSo yesterday I went out to lunch with my mom and I told her the news, to which she was thrilled for my wife and I. I didn't think anything of it until when I told my wife that I told my mom and she was immediately upset with me.\n\nShe said that she wasn't ready for people to know given how her last pregnancy ended. She said that now because my mom knows that she is pregnant, she's now going to know if something goes wrong, and she's not comfortable with that. When I asked her why that is such a big deal all she could say was\"it just is\" and that I wouldn't understand.\n\nIn my defense, it's not just her news to share, it's OURS and I feel like it was completely reasonable to tell my mom as she is an immediate family member who I am very close with. ,    I also know for a fact she already told her sister so I just don't see how me telling my mom is a problem. She also never communicated to me that she wanted me to keep the news to myself.\n\nA day later and she's still very much so mad at me, I am getting the silent treatment and she avoids me like I am the one who did something bad. Again, I really don't think I did anything wrong here.\n\nWhile I understand that it's her body I think its unfair that she can tell her support system but I'm not allowed to tell mine.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit:\n\nAfter typing this all out and coming back and reading it again I realized that I sound like a dick and apologized to her. She accepted my apology, and we made up and got sushi. Thank you reddit for helping me realize I was in the wrong lol.  \n\n\nAnother edit since this I've noticed a trend:\n\nMy wife did not have raw fish sushi, she had a california roll with imitation crab, which is perfectly fine from everything we read.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1696969130, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/174v0xm/aita_for_telling_my_mom_that_my_wife_is_pregnant/", "score": 2146, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You aren't the one whose body is now responsible for this new little life and you aren't the one whose hormones will be swinging wildly. \n\nHas her sister had children? She probably wants someone to text every little ache and pain to who can talk her off the ledge, especially during the early days, so that she doesn't start Googling and freak herself out. She does need a support system, and that isn't saying you don't--but you should have cleared it with her. Maybe she doesn't want your mom specifically to know, but your best friend or brother would have been fine.", "wow, Wow, WOW...you really can't be this obtuse.  Quick lesson from a 62 year old married guy...for the record, yes, the two of you are married and you're both 'sort of' pregnant.  But now listen very carefully.  My wife endured two miscarriages and I don't care who the guy is...there is no way, repeat NO WAY, we as men can fully understand the emotions women go through if a pregnancy goes wrong.  furthermore...did you swear your mother to secret or has she now told everyone and anyone that your expecting?  Now...think for a moment of what this will put your wife through if, heaven forbid, something goes wrong with the pregnancy?  If by now 47 other people know about the pregnancy and something does go wrong...imagine your poor wife having to explain 47 times over her heartache and how it makes her feel?\n\nSo yes...you are a clueless AH", "YTA. The miscarriage was more visceral for her than you and she most likely relied on her sister to get her through it. She wants to be private for a while. Why is that hard to understand?\n\nYou seem to be doing this weird \"if you can, I can\" justification that sounds childish at best. it is too bad what could have been a happy time is undermined.\n\n(Are you a momma's boy or just spoiled?)", "Kinda soft YTA because it is a period of uncertainty for your wife given what has occured previously. Most couples wait 3 to 4 months before announcing for this very reason. I realise you are excited but consider that your mum will blab to everyone and if something goes wrong those everyones will keep asking your wife about the baby. It will be shit for her.", "YTA! \n\nIt isn\u2019t your pregnancy. Yeah, the meninists can come out for me but the woman is the one going through the physical changes, hormonal ups and downs. The woman is the one who has to push a child out of her vagina. They say \u201cwomen become mothers the minute they\u2019re pregnant whereas men become fathers after the baby is born.\u201d\n\nWhile there are always exceptions, this is the case because women feel the baby moving, kicking. The trauma of miscarriage hits a woman very differently than it does a man.\n\nSo you should have waited to speak to her, when she\u2019s comfortable to share and only then tell the news.\n\nAlso - why don\u2019t many many men respect their wives when it comes to their mothers? I just don\u2019t get this.", "YTA\n\nThere's alot to unpack here.\n\nso, I do think there's a core communication issue here.\n\nGiven her pregnancy issue in the past, when, how, and who to break the news to should've been discussed before anyone was told.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>When I asked her why that is such a big deal all she could say was\"it just is\" and that I wouldn't understand.\n\nwell..\n\nthink about all the little conversations of having to break the news of the miscarriage to people...\n\n...people who just heard on social media about the baby a few months ago, haven't heard anything since.\n\npeople who see her at the grocery store or whatever\n\n\"oh, how's your bump looking!\" oblivious to the tragedy, and the hour or 2 your wife needs to now spend just sorta...dealing with that wound re-opening out of the blue.\n\n20 people who know now is potentially 20 new little tragedies to twist the knife, down the road.\n\n*she's scared, my dude.*\n\nYour wife and yourself experienced an emotional trauma when she miscarried.\n\nShe also had physical trauma and hormones on top of that.\n\nI can completely understand why she wouldnt want the new to be out-out yet.\n\nIf it doesnt go well, the people who now know could do more harm than good when trying to comfort her.\n\nhaving to break the news to each one a new little tragedy\n\nShe doesnt want that stress while going thru the physical trauma again.\n\nAs far as telling her sister... this is the key here;\n\nshe's allowed to tell someone close to her.\n\n\\*\\*she needs the support of people she trusts.\\*\\*\n\nshe's also allowed to keep that group of people as limited or as expansive as she wants.\n\nI think it's perfectly reasonable that that group includes her sister and you, *but doesnt include your mom.*\n\nThis is a both or nothing situation.\n\n**you BOTH need to agree to loop someone in, or they dont get looped in. single veto rules.**\n\nreading this, it seems you don't really care that her sister knows, and probably would've said yes. That'd be 2 yesses for sister.\n\nit seems that if you guys talked about it first, and used this single veto system, you would've asked about mom, she wouldve said no, and that wouldve been the end of it.\n\nI think BOTH of you being comfortable with who knows what, and when, trumps anything else.\n\n***I would bring this solution to her. nothing that can be done about mom knowing now, but i think if you apologize, and offer this as a way to disclose the information going forward, it'll go a long way towards her forgiving you and you guys acting like a team again.***\n\nremember, a veto now, isn't a veto forever.\n\nas things progress, first trimester, second, these vetoed people should be revisited, if you feel strongly about it.\n\n*but don't push it.*\n\n...especially once she's in the 'safe zone' for her body and pregnancy, they'll all quickly turn to yesses... however, expect her to be hesitant well into that 'safe zone'\n\nI can see this schedule working:\n\n1st trimester: her sister, you, and your mom (by mistake, but she's here now) .\n\n2nd trimester, maybe expand that to all immediate family, your mom and dad, hers, etc, but NO SOCIAL MEDIA. \n\n3rd trimester, go wild, post on the socials and tell everyone.  \n\n\ndon't be surprised if that last one is delayed a bit. let her take it sloooooow", "Yta you went out by yourself to tell your mom. That\u2019s a together announcement.", "YTA - Especially when you have experienced miscarriages before, telling others of a pregnancy immediately after testing is incredibly difficult and sensitive. Your wife is already probably extremely anxious and feeling enough pressure from herself to carry this child safely and not feel like a failure and heartbroken if something happened.\n\nMost doctors etc generally advise waiting a certain period before telling others because the early weeks are very volatile. Regardless though, you and your wife should talk about when telling others is ok. It is news that belongs to both of you.", "YTA  there\u2019s usually a \u201csafe\u201d timeline to begin telling people\u2026. she\u2019s already experienced a loss with her miscarriage. She\u2019s on edge with good reason. Her sister is her support system to the things happening to HER body, your mother is not.", "YTA - just because she is pregnant with your sperm doesn't give you the right to tell people she is pregnant.  You are not pregnant and therefore it is not your pregnancy to announce.  I would recommend couple's counseling because I think you have deeply betrayed her trust, and I can't tell if you are truly as dense as you are coming across here, or if you just have no empathy for your wife's feelings.", "It's great telling folks that you're pregnant, it's grim having to tell them that you aren't anymore, your wife had already done that once so she knows only too well.   Lots of pregnancies fail, most of the time there is nothing the mother could have done, or not done, to improve the chances of a good outcome, but that doesn't stop people making judgements.  \n\nYTA. You don't tell anyone until you both feel confident.", "YTA just in general it's customary to wait a certain amount of time before telling people. Did she \"announce\" to her sister or was she seeking her sister for council and support. There's a difference.", "INFO: who has to break the news and deal with the fall out if she miscarried again? Are you aware how common it is to not tell people until after the first trimester due to risk of miscarriage?", "YTA. Most people, especially those who have experienced a miscarriage, wait until the end of the 1st trimester. You reaction is100% a dude not understanding how terrifying the 1st trimester can be, and how that is heightened if you have already gone through the devestation of loosing a baby before.\n\nMost people keep the circle as small as possible before then b/c they want to mourn in private, don't want everyone to know thir business. It isn't fair, but women are often blamed for the miscarriage and they feel internalized guilt as well. There is a lot of pressure on women - not to mention her hormones are already taking a toll. So the circle is kept small b/c women also don't want to face the judgment and the disappointment that having a miscarriage can bring out in family members. On top of than, they have to deal w/ the physical effects and the simple reality that most women (not all, but most) have a stronger emotional connection to the fetus (see: hormones).\n\nYour wife is right, the more people who know, the more she has to face with your grief, shame, and feeling that she disappointed them at the same time she is dealing with everything else.\n\nYour wife told her sister b/c if she DOES have a miscarriage, the person she would go to for additional support is her sister. Her sister knows to keep it quiet. Your wife needs someone to share her fears and anxiety with, and frankly, you sound completely clueless on that front.\n\nYou told your mom. Your mom doesn't know your wife wants to keep it close for a while. How many aunts, uncles, mom's friends, 2nd cousins once removed know by now? \n\nYes, it is both of your baby and hers and it is both your news but you better clue in quickly that this is not the same experience for both of you. Sharing with people impacts her more than it impacts you.\n\nRelatedly - the default is to plan together on when you are telling the parents on both sides b/c often there is jealousy when you announce it to one set of parents long before you announce it to the other.\n\n\nIn other this experience is not the same for you as her news:\n\n1. Her body is going to go through A LOT - growing a baby inside you and going through child birth are not the same as providing sperm and purtting the crib from Ikea together.\n\n2 You will be treated more or less the same for the next 12 months by people, everyone will change how they treat her. She will have \"helpful\" people policing what she eats/drinks, only talking to her about the baby and nothing else, people, even complete strangers randomly touching her stomach w/o consent or telling her maternity horror stories. Additionally, she may have colleagues who try to sidline her at work now that she is pregnant - and even if she doesn't, it is a reasonable worry in this day and age.\n\n3. People will judge her for her for every decision made about pregnancy/childbirth/baby's 1st year, you will hear very little of any of this, unless a family memeber decides you need to \"talk some sense into her. Just a small list of what she will be judged on: home birth/hospital birth, breast feeding/bottle feeding, gaining too much weight/not enough weight, exercising/not exercising, SAH mom/working mom, if she wears heals during pregnancy, if her clothes are too maternity/not maternity enough - everyone will have an opinion on every single apect of this even.\n\nYeah, it sucks that as the dad, in general you are not the primary attraction at this point of the event, but the reality is, there is just no comparison between what the 2 of you will go throung in the next 12 months. Look on the bright side, you aren't risking your health (or even your life) during this period and you still get to be treated like an individual human being instead of the community property baby incubator.", "YTA! There is a difference between \"sharing the news\" like you did with your precious mommy, and wanting support from someone close to you who share your anatomy. \n\nIf you had written; \"I talked with my mother because I am anxious for another misscarriage and want her support\", it would be N T A. \n\n15-20% of all pregnancies end in misscarriage, and 80% of these occur before pregnancy week 12. As a woman, to have another woman to talk about physical and emotional symptoms is important. Hence, she told her sister. \n\nI know you're excited, and having a misscarriage would be sad for you too. But the physical and hormonal clusterfuck your wife would be going through is beyond just sad. She can tell you she is in pain, but can you relate to the feeling of your uterus being filled with broken glass clawing its way out of your body? No? And that is 'just' period cramps. Ovulation cramps and ovary cysts are many times worse, and I've been told that misscarriages (never had one myself, but would not doubt any woman telling me since I've had the other 2) are way beyond even that. \n\nI frequently talk to other women about pains and what is normal or un-normal. Rarely have these discussions with my partners or other guys because they just can't relate (just like I could never relate to the feeling of gravity on balls when you're on a rollercoaster...I've been told that this is a thing.\ud83d\ude05)\n\nAnd you're even more YTA for being dismissive of your wife and her concerns, which might be why she also sees her sister as #1 support and not you.", "YTA - you should have talked to your wife first. I see your perspective and you should be allowed to talk with someone - but clear it with your wife first. Did you consider your mom might be the last person she wants you to tell?", "YTA, its both of your news and you decided to share it without a discussion first or taking your wife's opinions or emotions in consideration", "yta, pregnancy announcements should be a mutual decision. \n\ni wouldn\u2019t want people knowing this early either. this wasn\u2019t just your news to share, it was hers too.", "Gentle YTA.  \n\n\nWhile I can appreciate the excitement you have for becoming a father it was inconsiderate of your wife's feelings. You say that she could have communicated that she wanted you to keep quiet about the news, but you also could have communicated that you were going to tell your mom.  \n\n\nRegardless of how you feel, her feelings matter more here because it's her body. Show her some compassion and empathy.", "YTA. Because only she knows how it feels to have to tell someone her body failed to bring a baby to term. You experience the miscarriage very differently. And there\u2019s still a huge stigma in women having them. By telling your mom without your wife\u2019s consent you added to the list of people that if something goes wrong she\u2019ll have to go through that again to.", "How did your mother react with the first miscarriage?", "Major YTA-SHE\u2019S pregnant, not you. You are there to support *her*.", "Gently, YTA. You shouldn't have shared the news with *anyone* before discussing it with your wife first. If you just found out a few days ago, I'm guessing it's very early in the pregnancy, and your wife is probably feeling extremely vulnerable, anxious, and fearful of having another miscarriage. It makes sense that she might want to confide in one other person she's close to (like her sister), but wouldn't necessarily want her mother-in-law to know. You're right that it's both of your news, but that means that *both of you* should agree on the timing and manner of making it public.", "I think you are not an asshole, but you were just a little impulsive? \n\nI can't even begin to imagine how devastating is to loose a pregnancy for both sides, but i think it is more emotionally challenging for the one who i carrying the baby. \n\nYour wife might feel all sort of emotions (guilty, embarassed, responsable) for the loss of your first pregnancy and maybe if this happens again (really hoping it doesnt) she doesnt really want to deal with knowing that someone else knew.  \n\nShe told her sister because she probabily is very close with her, and would 100% feel safe with her.\n\nI think you should have just asked her. And since you can't go back in time and _untell_ your mom, i say you just apologize to her.", "So but YTA.\n\nI went through a miscarriage and had already told my mother and MIL because they are the two that know I am going through IUI but it was really tough. \n\nWe both have already agreed that if we are successful again, we will wait until week 10-12 because although support during tough times is needed, it isn't necessarily our family (I have a therapist). \n\nI know it is your future child but it is NOT your body and you are not the one who physically went through the loss (I know you went through it too but its not the same).", "Yea YTA.", "YTA. As somebody who\u2019s had a miscarriage, when I got pregnant that time I announced it immediately. Then lost the baby. The shame and guilt I felt and how many \u201csorry for your loss\u201d I got didn\u2019t help. I\u2019m now 29 weeks pregnant and because I wanted to make sure this baby was viable on my own, and as much as I wanted to tell people, my peace of mind and how I was gonna watch my body grow this baby and checking for any signs that I could lose them. This wasn\u2019t your call. Sure. It\u2019s not just her baby. But you didn\u2019t take her feelings or anything into consideration. \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal?\u201d Is such an asshole thing to say to someone who clearly thinks it\u2019s a big deal. I didn\u2019t tell anybody until I was 20 weeks and my partner was on board because at the end of the day, it was my body that would lose the baby. I didn\u2019t want to tell people, then have to tell them all again that I lost the baby. You don\u2019t understand how hard that is to move on from when you keep getting questions about your no longer viable pregnancy. And now your mom has probably told others. Maybe your partner wanted to plan a surprise?. You just rushed this on your own. And that isn\u2019t fair.", "YTA. You should decide together when to tell people.", "YTA\n\nThis was news about both of you, not only you. She is the pregnant one. You should have talk about it first.

Will you experience the hormone changes of a miscarriage? Will you wonder what you did wrong- did you eat the wrong thing, did you lift something too heavy, did you have a drink before realizing you were pregnant?\n\nIt isn't just OUR news to share, there is a physical and mental toll of pregnancy- and miscarriage- that the person who is not carrying the child simply will not experience. There is so much shame and stigma wrapped up in women who cannot successfully carry a child, and you sir, cannot experience that with your wife. \n\nYou are getting the silent treatment because your life partner realized that you view this as NEWS, not as a deeply personal, terrifying, and life changing experience. You are not the one who will panic at every mild cramp, who thinks endlessly about what to eat and what vitamins to take, and that's not your fault, it is just how pregnancy works. But to so boldly say OUR and make it clear that you view your experience as equal to hers has made her confront the reality that you, her life partner, lacks empathy and support for her, and has made this about YOU.", "YTA - you should have discussed this with your wife before telling anyone.", "YTA it's not \"our\" news to share. It's her's. She is the one who went through the miscarriage. Not you. You were on the sidelines when it happened. The same way you are on the sidelines while she is pregnant. \n She is the one who will be going through all the challenges and changes of pregnancy Not you. \n\nMy husband knew with each of our pregnancies to keep his mouth shut until I was ready to announce it. \nAs he put it he isn't the one who has to give thier body for over a year to have a child.", "You are both pregnant in the social sense, but only your wife is pregnant in the _medical_ sense.

So your wife is obviously nervous, stressed and scared. You should have known that she\u2019s not ready to tell anyone especially her MIL. Once one person knows then it\u2019s spreads like wildfire. This was very insensitive on your behalf and it should have been something you discussed and shared together when she was ready.\n\nShe shared it with her sister because she needed to talk to someone she trusted. She\u2019s been through a traumatic experience and it happened to HER BODY. You would never understand that.", "YTA. There is something you really need to accept when it comes to pregnancy. Pregnancy is inherently unfair. But it is widely more unfair for your wife than it is for you. \n\nSo while that does not mean she gets to dictate everything (baby\u2019s names, nursery decorations, etc) there are a lot of things that she gets more say in than you do, because it\u2019s her body. \n\nYou deserve to have someone in your support system who knows, but you should have made sure it was someone she was comfortable with.", "YTA  \nSeriously she gets to decide when to share, it was her body going through a miscarriage, it is her body carrying the hope of a child. Please for the love of everything support your wife!", "It's another case of lack of communication causing upset. Both parties are in the right. I'm leaning toward YTA . You said it yourself it's both your news to spread, and you shouldn't have spread it without the conversation first. \n\nBut on the other hand  your wife shouldn't have assumed  that your going to keep it secret because of the past. To me that's more reason to spread the news. But I can  see why she might not want it spread. \n\nFrom what little I understand of this type of situation, many mothers that experience miscarriages feel they are to blame or like a failure even though blameless. Your wife is trying to prevent further embrassement  just in case. I am guessing she is now feeling pressure not \"ruin\" this chance with an audience watching. (Reminder that feelings don't always make sense)   and that pressure has come from you putting a spotlight on things. \n\nI really hope that some people with more experience of this corrects any bullshit that's in this comment. I'm a gay man with no interest of starting a family so I am not in the best position to make that many accurate insights.", "It wasn't your pregnancy to share. Not an asshole, maybe a little bit attached to your mother more than your wife. It's hard to say, not being you.\n\nAs much as you likely created the sperm, it's not 'ours' until the baby exists. Or, until you discuss with your wife when she's actually comfortable with telling others.\n\nIt's entirely HER body. Maybe ask yourself why you feel otherwise.", "It's tough, but I think this is a YTA. You guys should have discussed this before you told anyone, and you shouldn't have assumed that it was fine to tell your mom. \n\nYour wife's reaction makes me wonder about her relationship with your mom. Did your mom criticize your wife when her last pregnancy ended? Is she judgemental? Does your mom give a lot of unsolicited advice that's just plain irritating? Pregnant women have it really hard, not just because they're growing an entire small human from scratch, but also because people are really, really weird about pregnant women. People think that because a woman is pregnant, they have a right to control her body. \n\nThere is also a lot of pressure on pregnant women, and shame and stigma around miscarriages, so even if your mom hasn't said anything, your wife might feel embarrassed and ashamed if something happens to the pregnancy and she knows that your mom knows that she \"failed.\" (Even though she didn't fail, these things just happen and it's no one's fault) \n\nI understand you were excited, but I think this warrants a serious conversation with your wife, and asking her if your mom has been rude to her when you weren't around.

She has to carry SO MUCH MORE WEIGHT than you during this period and ignoring that fact bc it\u2019s your baby too is short-sighted and selfish. You can\u2019t possibly know what those changes do to your body and mind and it\u2019s scary that you\u2019re willing to have a baby with her but not listen to her when it comes to her body. She can\u2019t explain it to you bc it\u2019s a horrible process and you put her in a state where now her brain is trying to protect her from reliving that trauma (and miscarriage can absolutely be and most often is a trauma for us, even in situations where it\u2019s an unwanted pregnancy) with an audience! An audience she never asked for. So why wouldn\u2019t you just trust her at her word?

It is her body, and if she miscarries before 12 weeks, she is also going to feel it is \"her\" failure to conceive again.

I assume her sister has children, which further substantiates this. \n\nYou only found out about the pregnancy a few days ago. If you are going to be the bearer of good news to your mother, than you MUST necessarily also be the bearer of bad news if something bad happens to save your wife from the problem of doing so herself. And then you will have to save your own emotions for the sake and favor of your wife's, who will feel her body has failed her in the event of most unfortunate happenings, since 8/10 miscarriages happen before 12 weeks, of which there is a 25% chance of happening. \n\nNews as a couple is hardly as a couple. Because in this case, your wife bears most of the unimaginable burden. She will have to grow a child in her body, have her body and mind torn apart and broken, and have to bear a lot of pains to do so - she has already had to do so once, and that is likely why she is so anxious. All you can do is be her support, her provider, and her coach in all of it. So no. It is not \"our\" news.

You are allowed to be excited and tell people, and she does not get the ultimate say in how that happens. As far as a general announcement, you should both come to a joint decision. But telling one person who can be there to watch your highs and lows from the beginning is a decision you can make without anyone else\u2019s say. Now, with that said, if she has a very important to her reason why she didn\u2019t want to share, you would need to respect her wishes and support that. However, she did not choose to make that known until AFTER you told someone, and still chooses not to attempt to communicate her feelings. Its very hard to support someone who\u2019s reasoning is \u201cit just is\u201d. Even just saying that it\u2019s difficult for her to communicate is better.

It\u2019s his pregnancy too, just because it\u2019s not his body doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not a huge part of this. Yes us women take the brunt physically but it\u2019s so much more than that. Financially men have to provide or work more in this situation and both have to deal with emotions for this. It\u2019s a team effort and to say it\u2019s not his, is a slap in the face to a real man who actually wants to stay. \n\nSecondly, you are not a mind reader. Your wife did not express that she didn\u2019t want you talking about the pregnancy and not only that, she was hypocritical and she herself is telling people? Wth. It\u2019s not fair that she\u2019s forcing you to stay silent on something you are equally a part of, but she gets to tell her family. Don\u2019t listen to these people saying your the AH. Most people are biased towards the mother, but given the context she did not ask you to not say anything and she herself is doing it. You are not the AH on being excited and sharing the news you are going to be a dad! Congrats btw. \n\nHowever, I do see where her fear is coming from. It\u2019s terrifying not knowing you\u2019re going to make it to full pregnancy and then you have to explain to everyone. It sucks knowing someone you don\u2019t want to know personal information has that information. She scared and because of that isnt communicating well. She should\u2019ve let you know she didn\u2019t want you to share the news (which in that case she shouldn\u2019t either). \n\nBut OP she is punishing you for something she herself did, and didn\u2019t say she didn\u2019t want you to do. Its not fair that she\u2019s treating this like it\u2019s \u201cher thing\u201d. You are the father and unless she doesn\u2019t want you to be a part of it, she should let you express the same way she is. Moving forward you both ahould come to a conclusion that is equal or good for both of you. \n\nIt\u2019s crazy how people want her to have a support system but except him to\u2026what\u2026sit silently until she calls upon him or gives him permission to let him speak about it? I\u2019m ashamed in a lot of people. She\u2019s allowed to be scared but she is not allowed to take his support system away when they both went through the same thing in different ways. They both went through a miscarriage, they are both probably worried about this one, and they both want to lean on and share with family.  \n\nI\u2019m not saying this will happen, but I wouldnt be surprised if you don\u2019t feel close to this baby. Not being able to share your excitement while she can, will alienate  you from this experience. \n\nI don\u2019t understand how people don\u2019t get it that when women hijack a pregnancy like only her family gets to know for now/kick the husband out of the delivery room (for no good reason) that this could affect the father and the babies relationship.

He can be excited about the baby, but when he told his mother that his wife is pregnant, he was telling his mother about his wife's medical information.

Your wife told a female she is close to who has been through pregnancy.

If, when she'd expressed upset that he'd told his mother because now she has to deal with his mother knowing if the worst happens, he'd said he was sorry and he shouldn't have done that, I don't think she'd still be as angry with him. But he's doubling down, and if he's expressed this \"It's OUR news to share\" attitude, it would definitely be adding to her frustration.

The actual advice is that after 12 weeks the risk of miscarriage is much lower and the pregnancy is far more likely to go to term.

BE KIND AND SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR WIFE, damn!\nOh and one more note, regarding you accusing HER of not communicating to you that you should keep the news to yourself, well, YOU should've asked HER what the expectations are because again, she's the one carrying, not you. Good luck to you guys though. Wishing a safe, healthy pregnancy and a loving, healthy, supported, and good recovery for your wife.", "I will not go into the miscarrying part as i haven't been through one and i don't think i should give any opinion on it. \n\nI'm sorry to say, but there is no \"our pregnancy\", i get that it isn't fair, but you had one job and that\u2019s it, at least until the baby is born. It would only be \"our pregnancy\" if you would do half of the job carrying the baby, but you can't (and that is the unfair part) and all of it rests on your wife. Every single thing - the emotional, the physical etc. So it is her pregnancy from start to finish, even though you were one of the contributing parties. \n\nYou told your mother because you were excited and that\u2019s great, but it's not the same as her telling her sister. As she is the one pregnant, then she is the one who gets to decide. She needs more support from the people she trusts. To me it seems that currently those people are you and her sister. And it probably will not be your mother if she doesn't have a mother-daughter bond with her. \n\nYou also need to think about the birth, cause it will be the same. She is the one who gets to allow people to be there for her at her most vulnerable point and those will be the people who she trusts the most. For example if your wife tells the nurses that MIL will not be allowed to be in the room when she pushes the baby out then trust me, the nurses will not allow your mother into the room even if you don't agree with it, because she is the one giving birth, not you. And it's not only because it's a medical procedure, but because she will only allow the most trusted people to be there for her at the most vulnerable point. \n\nAll you can do is support her as much as you can during the pregnancy and birth, but it is not the same for you as it is for her.

He should have asked first, but she could have also said she wanted to keep it private with just her sister until she is ready before telling her sister. OP became an asshole in doubling down and not apologizing. Men aren't mind readers, mistakes happen, everyone is genuinely excited and perhaps OP is not fully comprehending the long-term effects the miscarriage had...

He deserves to be able to confide in someone as well. They birth are expecting. The mom is carrying the baby but I\u2019m sure she need OP support. OP needs support as well.
