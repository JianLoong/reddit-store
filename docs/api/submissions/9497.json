I like my step-son and would describe our relationship as cordial. Now that he\u02bcs slowly entering puberty, he started to get a bit bratty. He often leaves trash around the house, doesn\u02bct clean up his room, forgets his homework and gets annoyed when he has to do chores. His birthday was today and he wanted a big party with all of his friends. My wife and I agreed.\nLast week I came home from a work trip and looked into his room. It was disgusting and messy. I got mad and called him. He was visiting a friend. I told him to come home immediately. When he came home, he was visibly annoyed but I didn\u02bct care, I told him to clean up his room. He got angry and said \u201cDon\u02bct tell me what to do, you\u02bcre not my dad. I don\u02bct have to listen to you\u201d this pissed me off. I replied \u201cThis is my house, so you will follow the rules. Clean up your room or your birthday party is canceled\u201d\nHe ran into his room and slammed the door.\nWhen my wife came home, he was trying to play the victim, but to his surprise, my wife was on my side. We told him again to clean up his room, but he refused and gave us the silent treatment until yesterday.\n\nI guess he remembered that he wanted his birthday party and was suddenly very friendly. He even offered to take the trash out. We didn\u02bct talk about his birthday party. Today was his birthday and when he woke up, he asked my wife if he could help her baking his birthday cake. I reminded him that his birthday party was canceled, since he refused to clean up his room. We told him we already called the parents of his friends and informed them that we canceled the party. We offered to take him to McDonald's instead. He started crying and said he hates us. He locked himself into his room and refused to come out. He also called his dad and grandparents, who immediately harassed me and my wife. They called us evil and said we were terrible parents. \nI understand that canceling his birthday party was a harsh punishment, but we gave him a fair chance, which he didn\u02bct take so he had to face consequences.

Why on earth are you having a pissing contest with an 11 yr old child. That whole \"your house,  your rules\" BS is just a point of frustration given the child has zero say over where he lives.  Save that kind of comment for when he's an adult living at home. You do realize he's got a lot of things going on that result in being a bit of a brat: divorced mom, disrupted life, adolescence, evil AH step father.  It's going to get worse before it gets better. A little compassion,  picking your battles,  punishments that fit the offense, will make all your lives easier. Maybe discuss appropriate punishments before meting them out. Try to be the grown up in the room instead of the despot.\n\nYes,  it's okay to have rules, but punishment should be proportionate.  No screentime until room is clean, and the like.  Birthday parties and gifts and \"Santa\" should not be used as leverage. They are an affirmation of you love for the child and only come sons once a year. (Good luck trying to get him to clean his room now,  with the next birthday a year away. )", "YTA. \n\nAll 11-year-olds are bratty as they go through puberty, and they begin rebelling.  But canceling a birthday party for not cleaning his room, with the comment \"This is my house so you'll do as I say\" was an overreaction.  And not having a further conversation to let him know that his party was canceled until the day of his birthday? Yeah, you and your wife are both major assholes for that.\n\nIt doesn't sound like you ever followed up with him after the initial conversation, or had a conversation with him about how the three of you are living together and what it means to be part of a family, and that Even though you're not his father, he has to follow certain rules for living in the house. Then you set out clear rules and clear expectations and clear chores that have to be done every day.  Tie some consequences to not doing those chores that are rational and related in scope to not doing the chores. Don't clean your room or put your plates away? No internet until you do.  Or no going to a friend's house after school until chores and homework are done.\n\nI would sit down with him and admit that you both made a mistake and shouldn't have canceled his birthday over a dirty room, and brainstorm with him about how you can make it up to him and change the tone of the house so that you can all get along better going forward. It's not that you should accept his behavior, it's how you went about trying to redress it that was wrong.", "YTA how could you be anything but ta? I\u2019m getting the feeling that you love the power trip, unfortunately for your wife I\u2019m guessing when he\u2019s old enough he\u2019s gonna live with his dad for the most part. He won\u2019t forget this", "YTA Complete over reaction.  I'm betting that kid can't wait for the day he can leave \"your\" house & never look back.", "YTA dude.\n\nYeah he was bratty and annoying, but he did eventually give in and did do the chores.  He's 11.  It's important to keep promises to kids, and arguably more important from parents to kids than the other way around.  \n\nAlso, you cancelled a once/year event over room cleaning.  Totally different scales.  Sorry.  You're TA.  And your step son is in his pre-teen years.  Wait till he's 14, that'll be fun.", "Dudes he 11, of course he\u2019s bratty, if he wasn\u2019t that would be more concerning tbh", "Is this a joke?  Your wife didn't even make him a birthday cake over a kids dirty room???  If this is serious wow YTA and when your wife complains her son doesn't talk to her you can point to her backing you in this instance (as i'm sure) just one example of why.", "I'd go with YTA\n\nIt's understood that there should be some form of punishment for his behavior but cancelling the birthday is too much. Not cleaning his room might warrant the confiscation of his computer, phone, or console until he finishes the cleaning, or maybe he won't be able to connect to the internet or leave the house until he straightens up.\n\nThis is a once a year celebration, and he's a kid. Kids look forward to this once a year celebrations.\n\nMight be time to explain to the kid as well as to why he needs to clean-up after himself and do chores.", "YTA - Your wife is as well. The punishment doesn\u2019t fit the crime. Not cleaning a room is typical kid behaviour and you went nuclear by cancelled his birthday party. Was there even a sit down conversation at all?", "Next will be \n\nMy step son hates me and his mum, gone to live with his dad. Where did we go wrong\u2026\n\nDude take a step back \n\nThe comment about Disney land \n\nWhat you going to do ban him from going..\n\nSeems like your trying to control him. He doesn\u2019t need controlling.\n\nTalk to him let his mother do the talking as well\nDon\u2019t go nuclear", "YTA. The punishment seems disproportionate to the offense. He didn\u2019t clean his room, and was rude to you. So take away video games, or some other privilege, for a week. That\u2019s a normal punishment. \n\nBut you cancelled his birthday party. I get it\u2019s not a required event and lots of kids don\u2019t have them, but it\u2019s a huge punishment for something pretty small. Plus, it\u2019s probably ruined your relationship with your stepson. He may learn to be polite and keep his room clean, but he\u2019s also learned you don\u2019t really care about him and there\u2019s no reason to make an effort to have a real relationship with you.", "YTA, he\u2019s fucking 11", "YTA. Calling him home immediately was a punishment that fits leaving his room in a chaotic state. You escalated above what is reasonable. If the deal for a party was \"keep your room clean\" then its different but in the heat of conflict when you are already fighting that you pile on consequences on top of consequences, its triggering the cascade of stubbornness and rebellion that overrides his immature brain's impulse control center. That's why you have to be the adult and keep the situation controlled not be as impulsive and stubborn as they are.", "YTA. He only lives with you because he's forced to. Let his mom decide what his responsibilities are and the consequences for his  defiance. Or are you trying to alienate him from his mother so you can have her all to yourself?", "YTA. First, that was an extreme punishment for the behavior. I have an almost 11yo. One rule my husband always says is to take aways privileges, not experiences. In our house, that counts as an experience. Extra chores, loss of electronics, etc. No loss of birthday parties, family get togethers, school events, etc. Taking away HIS OWN BIRTHDAY PARTY for not cleaning his room was beyond extreme.", "YTA.  While I believe actions have consequences, was this really the hill to die on after only 1 year as his stepfather?  He is young and at the age where rebellion starts and Mom has a new guy taking time away from him.  What did you expect?  Spend some significant time mending your relationship with him or it is going to get worse.", "YTA and so is your wife. Awful.", "It\u2019s obvious you don\u2019t really like him and you\u2019re being a bully. Your wife should take him and leave before you traumatize him any more. YTA", "YTA.  He is testing you and you two failed.  Instead of ignoring the room, your wife should have gone in there and said clean your room now and watched him.  Teens are not fun.  He obviously thought you two would give in because it\u2019s his birthday.  You two failed to make him do it so he understood that was the reason he WAS getting to have the birthday party.  Positive reinforcement gets you farther.", "YTA. Congrats on being the evil step dad", ">One year ago \n\nThe child has not had enough time to adapt to you as an authority figure. Any non-emergency parenting decisions should go through his mother first, until he knows you.\n\n>Now that he\u02bcs slowly entering puberty, he started to get a bit bratty. \n\nLet's see...\n\n>He often leaves trash around the house, \n\nNormal, and even with typically tidy older teens will continue to happen occasionally until probably post-college years.\n\n>doesn\u02bct clean up his room, \n\nNormal. And without parents who are responsible and stay on top of it/give gentle reminders, he *never* will. And the more you try to force it, the dirtier it will get.\n\n>forgets his homework \n\nNormal at this age. 11 year olds still need parental guidance\n\n>and gets annoyed when he has to do chores.\n\nAs does every child, teen, and adult on the planet. Perfectly normal.\n\nYou've not given one single example of anything remotely bratty. Leaning to the kid's side at this point, because you calling a child bratty for behaving in age appropriate ways, makes you kind of an AH.\n\n>His birthday was today and he wanted a big party with all of his friends.\n\nSounds like the bare minimum, as long as you can afford it.\n\n> My wife and I agreed.\n\nGood, so short of something physically preventing this party from happening, like, say, a house fire, then it should happen. You already said he could have it. If he doesn't have it, he might never trust either of you again.\n\n>Last week I came home from a work trip and looked into his room.\n\nSo, my assumption is that since this is last week, and the child is only 11, any punishments will stay in last week.\n\n>It was disgusting and messy.\n\nWhich is, again, normal. And, since you've implied this is habitual, not unexpected. Since it's expected, you should have already had a plan for a consistent consequence to occur every time this happens.\n\n>I got mad\n\nThen you're an AH. You're letting a child's age appropriate behavior control your mood. How very mature of you.\n\n>I got mad and called him.\n\nShould have left it to his mother. Not really an AH move, but not very smart either.\n\n>He was visiting a friend. I told him to come home immediately.\n\nThat's fair, other than, yknow, it should have come from his mother, who is the only authority figure he's emotionally able to recognize at this point in the relationship. But a fair consequence for a messy room.\n\n>When he came home, he was visibly annoyed\n\nAs any 11 year old would be, to be called away from a friend's house.\n\n>but I didn\u02bct care, \n\nBut you should have. Instilling any lesson in an annoyed child is impossible. The responsible adult in this situation needs to get them to a calm place where they can process what's happening first.\n\n> I told him to clean up his room.\n\nNot physically possible until he vents those emotions. You needed to address that first. No way in hell he's going to clean the room.\n\n>He got angry \n\nHe was already annoyed, and someone he barely knows is ordering him to do something he hates. What did you expect?\n\n> and said \u201cDon\u02bct tell me what to do, you\u02bcre not my dad.\n\nYou aren't. You're his mother's husband. That is all.\n\n> I don\u02bct have to listen to you\u201d \n\nAnd that depends, not on what *you* think, or what *he* thinks, but on what both his mother and his father have said to him about listening to you. Hopefully you said something calm and questioning, like \"Do you think mom would agree with that?\" or \"Has someone said you don't have to listen to me?\" or \"Do you know what step-dad means, kiddo?\" so that you could open a productive dialogue with him.\n\n>this pissed me off.\n\nHave you considered anger management? Cause this is quite sad. Stop letting a literal child control your emotions. Seriously. It's pathetic.\n\n>I replied \u201cThis is my house, so you will follow the rules.\n\nGood job telling your stepchild that this is not his home, and you're a dictator!\n\n> Clean up your room or your birthday party is canceled\u201d\n\nWhat an ignorant consequence. A week away, so without urgency,  completely unrelated to the behavior so it won't teach anything, overly harsh so that he'll think of you as someone with no self-control, breaking an already established agreement so he'll never trust you, and yknow, it's a holiday about celebrating the child as a person, so he'll know you don't respect him as a person. \n\nAbsolutely the worst idea you could have come up with.\n\n>He ran into his room and slammed the door. \n\nA normal reaction to an out of control adult raging at him.\n\n>When my wife came home, he was trying to play the victim,\n\nDo you mean by telling her what actually happened? That's not playing the victim. He was the victim.\n\n>but to his surprise, my wife was on my side. \n\nSad, because if she'd just had a conversation with her child instead of taking sides, he likely would have cleaned his room. If she'd corrected your over-zealousness by having a \"family meeting\" about it, he would have cleaned his room. If she just unilaterally sided with you, he will not clean his room.\n\nAlso, if you pressured her to side with you, or lied/omitted things at *all*, you're not just an AH, but an abusive AH. I doubt you did, though, right?\n\n>We told him again to clean up his room,\n\nNot going to happen while he has no way to deal with the trauma you just inflicted.\n\n>but he refused and gave us the silent treatment until yesterday.\n\nFor an entire week. That's... you're both pretty pathetic as parents, ngl. Like I try to judge individual situations and not overall parenting but this is so bad. You're really bad at this.\n\n>I guess he remembered that he wanted his birthday party and was suddenly very friendly. He even offered to take the trash out. \n\nOr he was just happy that his birthday is coming up, and happy kids are generally friendly.\n\n>We didn\u02bct talk about his birthday party. \n\nThen you obviously didn't cancel it. No way you expected this child of 11 to remember some bs overreaction from a week ago and apply it to a once-a-year event *on your first year with him*. \n\n>Today was his birthday and when he woke up, he asked my wife if he could help her baking his birthday cake.\n\nWhat a fun thing! He wants to help out. So sweet!\n\n> I reminded him that his birthday party was canceled, since he refused to clean up his room.\n\nWhy are you reminding him if he was talking to his mom? You sound like an overbearing, controlling AH, ngl.\n\nAnd also, again, stupid punishment.\n\n>We told him we already called the parents of his friends and informed them that we canceled the party.\n\nAnd now you've humiliated him with his friends. \n\n>We offered to take him to McDonald's instead. \n\nWhat a lousy way to.... McDonald's is nowhere near the level of birthday party AND it's a conciliatory gesture, which completely undermines the whole \"we know what we're doing\" part of you sticking to the punishment.\n\n>He started crying and said he hates us. \n\nI bet he does. He has every reason to. You married his mother and turned into a control freak who ruined 1/11th of his life. About 1/8th of his memorable years.\n\n> He locked himself into his room and refused to come out.\n\nI would have too. He's probably terrified since there's no way of knowing how you will ever react to anything.\n\n>He also called his dad and grandparents,\n\nGood. Kids should ALWAYS be encouraged to talk to an adult they trust if they think something is not right.\n\n>who immediately harassed me and my wife.\n\nAnother parent giving feedback on parenting/punishment issues, especially ones affecting major life events, is NOT harrassment. I'm assuming you mean they called and told you off.\n\n>They called us evil \n\nI wouldn't say evil. Horrible AH's, yes. Bad parents, yes. Out of control, yes. I haven't seen \"evil\" yet, though.\n\n>and said we were terrible parents.\n\nA fair assessment.\n\n> I understand that canceling his birthday party was a harsh punishment,\n\nAt the very least.\n\n>but we gave him a fair chance, which he didn\u02bct take\n\nIt wasn't remotely fair. This child had no chance of succeeding at this \"chance\".\n\n> so he had to face consequences.\n\nBut you've already stated that these consequences were harsh. You already know you done goofed. Why are you pretending you don't know that?\n\n>Am I the asshole?\n\nYes\n\nAnd I really hope this was a one off, and you actually care more about this child than about marking your territory and that things change immediately. Or that the kid tells a judge he wants to live with dad or grandma and grandpa. Cause YTA", "YTA.\n\nYou didn\u2019t cancel his birthday party. You cancelled his birthday.\n\nHe\u2019s 11. He will remember this when he\u2019s  Eleventy-one. He will remember that he hates you. But he\u2019s not going to remember that he didn\u2019t clean his room.\n\nIf you want to step in as the authoritarian, I support that. However, you need to give a lot if you\u2019re taking that role- time and effort. Taking his birthday away was a missed chance to show support.", "YTA. \n1) He\u2019s 11. The punishment for not cleaning up the room is a dirty room. If it gets unsanitary then you need to help him learn to realize the dangers and help him clean and maintain his room. \n2) Cancelling a birthday party is unfair to him AMD his friends. \n3) And most importantly: you didn\u2019t just cancel his birthday party. You cancelled his birthday. That\u2019s very different. You ruined his whole birthday. McDonald\u2019s? What a slap in the face (unless he loves it, but still harsh)\n\nEdit: omg I have been reading all your replies and I\u2019m doubling down on YTA. Now you\u2019re threatening his Disneyland trip with what seems like pleasure. Also you refer to him as if he\u2019s a nuisance to you. He\u2019s your stepson. Your wife\u2019s son. You should never have married someone with a kid.", "YTA - this was a huge overreaction to what literally is normal kid behavior, especially one getting used to a new parent. \n\nYou\u2019re going to make this kid resent you and you\u2019ll long for the days when you were cordial.", "Going with YTA. Your job, as a parent, is to set firm, clear rules, stay calm, and attempt to help your child make good decisions. You both flew off the handle and escalated a minor situation. The difference is that he's 11 and you're the adults. Also, it's needlessly cruel and excessive.", "YTA and so is your wife. When he gets to decide where he lives, leaves and doesn\u2019t look back, enjoy comforting her, and reassuring her that it\u2019s not her fault, even though it is completely the fault of you two. \n\nSoak up the forced parenting now. When it\u2019s no longer up to the birth mother, you won\u2019t have the chance.", "I agree with the advice you\u2019re getting but want to add this food for thought. \n\n\nThis kid had no say in what happened to him. His mom married you, and they moved into your house. That\u2019s a lot for anyone, let alone an 11 year old. \n\n\nGiven these circumstances, he probably already feels a little out of place. But then you go and say it\u2019s your house, your rules? You made him feel like even more of an outsider\u2014his home is not his home, it\u2019s *yours*, his father figure is not his dad, his mom has turned on him\u2026I mean you\u2019ve completely alienated this child. He feels like he has no one in his corner and he\u2019s a guest in his own residence. Imagine how that must feel. \n\n\nYTA", "YTA.  You\u2019re having a pissing contest with a 12 year old.  I\u2019ve read all your comments to what people have told you and you\u2019re an even bigger AH than I originally thought.  Since your wife is so supportive I dare you to show her this thread along with your answers.  If she still agrees with you than I hope to God her ex-husband takes her to court to get custody of his son.  I see her writing here in the future, \u201cI have no idea why my son went NC with me\u201d.", "YTA\n\nHe's a kid going through puberty. He's gonna act out, and canceling his birthday party is going to do nothing, but remove any level of cordialness that exists. It's not going to a birthday party, it's his own. He deserves to know there's consequences, but not to the level of losing the day that's supposed to be for just him.", "Yta. Both you and your wife. The punishment needs to fit the crime. This was excessive. And he's right, you are not his father. Does that mean he can disrespect you? No. But he needs to feel safe with you. I'm sure it was hard for him gaining a step father. All of you need to sit down and have a major conversation.  And all kids are bratty jerks when entering into the teenage years. Buckle up. It's only gonna get worse before it gets better.", "YTA - It\u2019s normal for pre-teens to be a bit bratty, and punishment is often needed. However, canceling a birthday is a bit much as he only gets to properly celebrate it once a year. A birthday may lose significance to us as we get older but he\u2019s at an age where it\u2019s arguably the most important day out of the year\u2026", "Yta. Puberty is like an alien invading yr kid. They themselves don't know why they behave like they do. Should he be punished ? Yes but shouting demanding and taking away a birthday? What a jerk. You and yr wife are both AH.", "YTA.  Kids get so few chances for birthday parties, especially as friends move away or go to different schools.  He had a bad night, said some things he didn\u2019t mean and tried to make it right the next day.  You should reschedule the party, and try some communication.  11 is a tough age even without major life changes.\n\nAlso, you cancelled it without explicitly telling him?  That\u2019s especially cruel as he was probably really excited and talking with his friends about it etc.", "YTA.", "YTA because instead of talking it over you let it go and made him think everything was fine afterwards until the day of his birthday where you both reminded him oops no birthday for you maybe we get McDonald\u2019s to make it all better. He\u2019s going to grow more and more angry with both of you to the point he even cuts ties with his mom.\nYou both need to make it up to him and fast. Next time take his tv or toys or no hanging out with friends type deal not cancel something he gets once a year.", "That was a massive overreaction to pretty typical kid behavior. His mother should be parenting him, NOT you. You are NOT his father, and any instruction should go from you to his mom to him. \n\nYou do NOT cancel a one-a-year event for something that can be fixed through chores as punishment and a change of behavior. \n\nYou and his supposed mother should be ashamed of yourselves. Good job destroying your chance at a relationship with this kid. Shame on your wife for letting this happen. She failed as a parent.\n\nYTA\n\nEdit: wording", "YTA.\n\nHe\u2019s a soon-to-be-teenager who is coping with his hormones and growing. He\u2019s going to be shitty at times and push back. \nDo you cancel a birthday party over it? No way. \n\nYou need to make it up to him.", "YTA", "YTA. The punishment did not fit the crime, and your communication is terrible to boot. I will also add that it was terrible manners toward the other children for you to cancel the party. We were always punished accordingly growing up, but never by taking away a social commitment we had made.", "Damn YTA. Are you proud of yourself for winning a pissing match with an 11 year old?", "YTA \n\nYou went from 0 to nuclear. \n\nWhy were you coming home from a trip and checking his room? We\u2019re you looking for a fight? Looking for a reason tk yell? Why call him back from his friends house to scream at him? Was your trip stressful and you needed to take it out on the 11 year old?", "YTA. You suck big time. You stole a child\u2019s birthday, one of the high points of the year, because you wanted to make some kind of sick power play in your home. Do you make him call you \u201csir\u201d too? You are a small and pathetic man. I hope he gets to move to his dad\u2019s when he\u2019s 16.", "YTA. So so so so much. Birthday parties are so important to kids. Only exceptional circumstances (e.g. the child displaying bigotry) would justify cancelling one. Your step son is acting out in the same way pretty much every kid does at some point. A minor punishment was justified, not this gross overreaction. He\u2019ll remember this for a long time, and I wouldn\u2019t blame a kid for holding it against you", "YTA\n\nYou way overreacted. Your punishment was harsh, cruel, and hit at the very core of the importance of him as a person. (You made it clear he isn't worth celebrating.) However, you really should not be handing out punishment for your new stepson. That is not an appropriate role for you at this point (and maybe never).  His mom needs to be the one doing that. Also, this is an 11 year old who has no say in how his life turned upside down. I am not surprised at all that he wants some sense of control in his room in YOUR house. It's not only developmentally appropriate at 11 but situationally appropriate for his current life circumstances. Blending a family is hard, and I think you and your wife need support and help negotiating appropriate roles, responsibilities, and expectations. Seek out the help of a family therapist. It will truly help.", "YTA, OP. After reading all your comments why the hell did you marry someone with a kid? It\u2019s pretty obvious you don\u2019t like your step-son and he knows that. Your wife is also AH as she clearly puts you above her kid and let\u2019s you treat him like crap.", "YTA, \nHe is right. You aren't his dad. He is going through a period of just getting to know you and he is young. He is going to act out for a bit...that's normal. At this time it's best for his mother to decide those things and not for you to just step up and say he can't have a party. Having a messy room isn't a big deal.

Even the most laid back kids go kinda psycho with the hormones,  school pressure,  social changes....it was HARD.\n\nTake some comfort that kids usually lash out the worst in situations where they feel safest - that's why so many parents get sass and teachers exclaim how well behaved the kid is.  Kid feels safe with you, that's no small thing .

I like my step-son and would describe our relationship as cordial. Now that he\u02bcs slowly entering puberty, he started to get a bit bratty. He often leaves trash around the house, doesn\u02bct clean up his room, forgets his homework and gets annoyed when he has to do chores. His birthday was today and he wanted a big party with all of his friends. My wife and I agreed.\nLast week I came home from a work trip and looked into his room. It was disgusting and messy. I got mad and called him. He was visiting a friend. I told him to come home immediately. When he came home, he was visibly annoyed but I didn\u02bct care, I told him to clean up his room. He got angry and said \u201cDon\u02bct tell me what to do, you\u02bcre not my dad. I don\u02bct have to listen to you\u201d this pissed me off. I replied \u201cThis is my house, so you will follow the rules. Clean up your room or your birthday party is canceled\u201d\nHe ran into his room and slammed the door.\nWhen my wife came home, he was trying to play the victim, but to his surprise, my wife was on my side. We told him again to clean up his room, but he refused and gave us the silent treatment until yesterday.\n\nI guess he remembered that he wanted his birthday party and was suddenly very friendly. He even offered to take the trash out. We didn\u02bct talk about his birthday party. Today was his birthday and when he woke up, he asked my wife if he could help her baking his birthday cake. I reminded him that his birthday party was canceled, since he refused to clean up his room. We told him we already called the parents of his friends and informed them that we canceled the party. We offered to take him to McDonald's instead. He started crying and said he hates us. He locked himself into his room and refused to come out. He also called his dad and grandparents, who immediately harassed me and my wife. They called us evil and said we were terrible parents. \nI understand that canceling his birthday party was a harsh punishment, but we gave him a fair chance, which he didn\u02bct take so he had to face consequences.
