If I can see, taste or smell them in a dish that someone intends for me to eat I will get physically ill. Unlike OP though my psychological problem with eggs is because my abusive step-mother(monster) used to force feed nasty greasy 1/2 cooked scrambled eggs to me when I was a child.

Seafood makes my mouth and throat itch.  Gluten gives me severe intestinal pain.  Lactose gives me almost instant cramping.  I won\u2019t die from any of these, but I\u2019d rather not have them happen.  I\u2019ve been told something was free of one of those things and I can tell within a minute if they are.  I always get the same responses, \u201cYour not allergic.\u201d  \u201cIt won\u2019t kill you.\u201d  \u201cI thought you were exaggerating.\u201d  I have ordered in food at a lot of places because I got tired of not eating while everyone else did.", "NTA. You should have taken a bite then puked on the table.", "NTA. You aren\u2019t saying everyone else can\u2019t enjoy seafood, just that you don\u2019t eat it. I also love to cook and when I plan a meal for family/friends the first thing I do is make a list of any foods people hate, are allergic to, can\u2019t eat for religious reasons, etc. If I am making something with one of those foods, I make sure there are plenty of other options, including a second entree if needed, and let the person affected know ahead of time. \n\nYour SIL was being intentionally rude. The only reason to make every dish with something a person doesn\u2019t like or can\u2019t eat is to specifically make a statement. She was saying your tastes aren\u2019t important, she wanted to embarrass you, etc. she just showed herself to be a petty, spiteful person. \n\nIt\u2019s not even about you having an issue with seafood. If you just don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s fine. She doesn\u2019t have to cater to you, but she should give you advanced warning to bring your own food because the meal she\u2019s cooking is seafood heavy. It\u2019s common courtesy. You shouldn\u2019t expect someone to eat food they don\u2019t like just because you disagree with their tastes. \n\nI don\u2019t eat seafood. I\u2019m not allergic, I just don\u2019t like it. I have friends who love it. They know I couldn\u2019t care less what anyone else eats, so if they make it and I\u2019ll be there they just tell me that dish has seafood. If it\u2019s the main dish, they either make me something else or give me a prior heads up to bring my own food (like for a catered party) and there\u2019s never been an issue. I do the same for them.\n\nI will say that if you are demanding no one cook/eat seafood when you\u2019re there, then you are being rude (unless it\u2019s a life threatening allergy).", "She did it deliberately and your brother knew because he must have seen the shopping and prep. She decided she was going to \u201cfix\u201d you and is annoyed you didn\u2019t suddenly get over your issue with sea food after she decided it was in your head. NTA", "NTA It is never disrespectful to get up and leave a bad situation. The whole menu was designed to completely get at you - it was a power move. Therefore you cannot be the disrespectful one in this situation. The whole thing was designed to bully and disrespect you, so the apology comes from her, not you. You were the victim in this.", "She didn't forget. She wanted to force the op to quit being a spoiled selfish baby. NTA.", "That's part of what I don't get...

The reason she is so mad is because OP stood up for herself and made her look bad.", "I won't die... It's not an allergy and I know it's 100% \"in my head\" but the reaction is still there.

That is bullshit.", "This is what I got most out of reading your perspective. This is not the actions of someone who is trying to help you through an issue. The fact that she put seafood into every single item of food was manipulative and purposefully done to force your hand. To put you in the role of A H for whatever you chose to do in that moment.

It happens, unfortunately.", "You're right.\n\nThe SIL was being superior, and treating the OP like a child by telling her to \"deal with it\".\n\nShe also broke a \"cardinal rule\" of hosting, if you will.  \n\nIt's actually basic courtesy and common sense.

Trying to make someone \"get over\" their dietary requirements is gaslighting, a narcissists favourite tool. And since you have never demanded special treatment, just a heads up in case of seafood on the menu, there is really no excuse for their asshattery.", "NTA, no it wasn't wrong for you getting food that you could eat that wouldn't mess you up. The fact that your brother and his wife are straight up bullying you says that you should block both of their numbers and not have dinner with them again. There are better ways to spend your sunday. Also your dad is a fucking asshole for thinking that it's still disrespectful for you to eat food, when she went out of her way to have you there, and then not feed you. Your dad is saying he's okay with your brother and his wife bullying you", "You're NTA. Your rude SIL is the one who needs to get over herself. How on earth does someone manage to make an entire meal where ever side contains seafood?

Sorry you have this trauma you live with, but I'm even sorrier that your family (with the exception of your dad) treats you so poorly.  \n\nThis is not about you and your seafood aversion; this is about wanting to have control over you. It is unseemly that you brother, his wife, and your mother all think their behavior is normal and acceptable.  \n\nIt's not.", "Definitely NTA.\n\nI would have been suspicious the moment they said the menu was secret.", "NTA.  You have trauma as a child. She KNEW that and did nothing to support you.\n\nI wouldn't go over there for dinner again.", "Seriously.", "Ya... Dad is the you eat what's in front of you type... I had already moved out when my mom's allergy went away, but I'm pretty sure he would have tried to force me to eat seafood if not...", "Absolutely 100% serious as a heart attack. My Dad's 2nd wife was a monster instead of a mother figure. I'm 45yo, she's been dead since 2007 & I'm still in therapy for some of the other crap she put me thru which caused PTSD.
