Is he driving around while high? What is the \"weed problem\", just that you don't like it? Is he spending so much that you're in financial distress?", "You married a guy who likes weed and now you're mad that he likes weed. Unless he's buying it when he can't afford it, YTA.", "It depends on your lifestyle as a family and on your financial situation too. Is $150+ a week a big expense for your family? If so, he might want to cut down because that's gonna take a toll on your finances.\n\nIt also depends on whether he is using or abusing the substance. Weed per se isn't bad, but everything that is abused and done in excess will have consequences. You've got to respect the substance, as they say. \n\nWhen I used to smoke pot 5+ times a day for about a year, I noticed changes in my behaviour that I disliked, I was very passive and would mostly lie in bed listening to music and raiding the fridge regularly. It didn't matter. I could do it, I was a student and didn't have pets, kids or family that needed me to be present and supportive at all times. The moment I started working full time, that was no longer viable, I stopped and had a shitty time doing so. \n\nWeed has many benefits but it affects everybody differently. As I was abusing it, my thinking wasn't as clear as it was when I was sober, I cannot deny that my memory got much worse than it already was and it started interfering with my studies. It took me several weeks of not smoking to go back to normal and clear my mind. I think we can all understand how that could have affected my family life, if I had one back then. \n\nGiving credit where credit is due, I've also heard many people claiming weed makes them MORE functional in their daily life, even at work. I myself could never even go to the shops or have an interaction with anybody that wasn't a trusted loved one when I was stoned, let alone go to work. It's a subjective experience. \n\nIf your husband can consume weed without abusing it and it doesn't interfere with his work and productivity, and if it doesn't negatively impact your family's emotional and financial stability, then you can just talk to him about what behaviours you wish would change and he has to work on them and respect your boundaries if you are to share a life together. It's perfectly reasonable. \n\nIf he's just plain abusing the substance and it's changing his behaviour noticeably in a toxic way (because it can rewire the way your brain's reward pathway fires over time if you are dependent on it: https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=Cannabis+reward+pathway+changes&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&t=1675786115101&u=%23p%3DJPwaCXp-rhwJ), as much as I like weed myself, then I think he has to cut down and sort himself out. You can do whatever you want when you're living in your own space and your habits don't affect anybody else in your life, you're king in the castle, I did so myself. But the moment your habit starts becoming an issue and taking a toll on your spouse or family, then you take responsibility for it, you get a grip and you act on it like a damn adult. \n\nWeed can be such a lovely, enjoyable experience to unwind, relax and think, but for me it was a slippery slope, I overdid it, started using it as a crutch to escape life and anxiety, and so I became addicted to it. It's not the drug, it's how you use it. \n\nDon't come for me for speaking the truth about my experience, fellow stoners. I will always love pot and smoke recreationally, but I'm not gonna lie and say getting addicted to it is impossible and that it doesn't have the potential to change your behaviour and perception of reality - because it can and it does, and it did that in my case. If you have family that's dependent on you to function, then you've got to make sure you use recreational drugs in a way that doesn't affect their lives.", "Info: *Why* do you want him to stop?

Keep the two issues separate, and don\u2019t let him use it as an excuse to justify his own bad behavior. The fact that he automatically resorts to this as his defense indicates even more that his smoking may not be a conscious choice/decision, but an addiction (if he really has good reason to smoke everyday, he should be able to explain this in a rational way).

People with underlying mental health problems often turn to drug abuse to cope. Weed is definitely one of the safest drugs for your partner to be relying on. Depending what underlying condition they have there may be better alternatives. Talk to a psychologist to see if you can get to the bottom of why he smokes so much weed.

Me on the other hand, I\u2019m on the side where it\u2019s a habit or \u201caddiction\u201d. That being said, unlike other drugs it\u2019s not a \u201cbad\u201d addiction. I don\u2019t smoke before work and I\u2019m fine all day, my appetite is fine, I can go all day without any cannabis but once it hits bed time, I have to get high to sleep. That\u2019s just my personal experience though, everyone is different", "...but then wouldn't the actual problem still be the tobacco?", "Its not.", "Totally depends on the partner and how they handle shit.  \n\nMy current girlfriend doesnt smoke, and unless i tell her im high, she doesnt even notice.  (Sitting next to her now, blazed as fuck, and asked if she noticed im high, and she did not)  \n\nIm sorry you had a negative experience dating a lazy stoner, but dont project that image on everyone. Guarantee you interact with several high people on the average day, and arent even aware of it.", "I'm truly sorry about your husband.\n\nYou have an issue where you don't seem to realize that requiring or depending on a chemical to relax or unwind is a chemical dependency, also known as addiction.

If smoking in the evening to relax or if you are using it medically as a sleep aid that is understandable.\n\nBut people that think being high allday/everyday is healthy just because its \"not addictive\" are in serious denial.", "Do you feel the same way about caffeine?", "My moderate use only extends to the work week because I have to work, the weekends I go on a \u201cbinge\u201d lol", "It's also a lot harder to test for and prove.", "Can you addicted to it? Yes. If you can't function without caffeine that's also a problem.", "If a person drinks enough coffee to be addicted to it, and cannot function without it, and is affecting their health with coffee\u2026 then yes.   I would.\n\nSmoking *anything* causes lung cancer.  Let\u2019s start there.  Coffee causes high blood pressure.  If you\u2019re drinking enough coffee to give yourself HBP and refusing to do anything about it, then - yes, it\u2019s a problem.\n\nIf you literally can\u2019t function without a cup of coffee in your hand - that\u2019s a problem.\n\nIf you would be a jerk to everyone if you skipped a day of coffee - that\u2019s a problem.", "\u201cDrunk drivers are proven to cause many more accidents in comparison to drivers under the influence of marijuana so drunk driving is worse\u201d\n\nTHATS awful logic?
