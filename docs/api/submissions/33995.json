My wife of 8 years was caught having an affair with another man and when I found that out I was devastated and went immediately to start filing papers. It\u2019s been 4 months since we officially separated and my daughter is taking the lack of maternal figure hard as she\u2019s just starting to hit puberty and it will be harder for her without someone with experience in that regard to guide her.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to go no contact with her but she refuses to leave me and my daughter alone.\nMy daughter was 2 when her mother, the love of my life passed away. About 3 years later I remarried to my now current ex wife Stephanie. She was really close with my daughter and did a great job helping raise her I will admit. My daughter views her as her mother since she was too young to remember her real mother.\n\nSince the separation I\u2019ve been adamant I do not want Stephanie in mine or my daughter\u2019s life. My daughter was heart broken and while she was furious at  Stephanie, she didn\u2019t want to cut her out of her life. I get it\u2019s hard for my daughter who now feels like she\u2019s lost her mother, but the last thing I want is Stephanie to try and act like she has some right to seeing my daughter or for her to try and get my daughter to think I\u2019m at fault for the divorce.\n\nThis week  Stephanie came by the house when I was at work and brought my daughter presents and stayed at the house for several hours waiting for me to come home. I assume she thought since she brought gifts and my daughter was there I\u2019d let her stay. I told Stephanie to leave before I call the police and my daughter started having a panic attack. Stephanie left and on the way out she told my daughter she\u2019d call her. I said no she wasn\u2019t and I\u2019ve since had my daughter\u2019s number changed and deleted Stephanie\u2019s contact from her phone so she couldn\u2019t remember the number.\n\nMy daughter is taking this really hard and I do feel so bad for her, but she needs to understand that Stephanie isn\u2019t her mom, is a bad person, and doesn\u2019t deserve my daughter in her life. \n\nTLDR: Am I the asshole for not letting my ex of 10 years not see my 13 year old daughter anymore?\n\nUPDATE: Say I did allow them to have contact, what would even be the right amount?? I would never let her see my daughter enough for it to be co parenting. Is once a month enough? Twice a month? I couldn\u2019t see it being any more than that.", "created_utc": 1703890746, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18u01nt/aita_for_not_letting_my_ex_wife_see_my_daughter/", "score": 198, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your daughter is struggling, and has now lost 2 mothers.

But you\u2019re a parent too, and your daughter\u2019s feelings and well being should supersede your own", "YTA - sorry but that lady (for all the wrong she did you) was a part of your daughters life for 10 years and you need to learn to be amicable for your daughters sake.", "YTA\n\nThis is your daughter\u2019s de facto mother.

Just because legally she isn't her mother or guardian doesn't change how your kid sees her, and while you can deny her a relationship that doesn't mean it's justified.\n\nRipping away yet another mother figure from her life isn't a solution here it just makes you feel better.", "YTA. It\u2019s not fair to your daughter to be forbidden to have any contact with who she considers to be her mother. \n\nI\u2019m not saying I\u2019d agree to an every other week custody agreement or anything, but I\u2019d allow some visitation, maybe some overnights, and contact on the phone.

To her, Stephanie IS her mother, and just because youve suddenly decided otherwise does not change the bond she's got. \n\nStephanie may not have a right to your daughter, but if you were doing what's best for your daughter you wouldn't be cutting her out completely and all of a sudden.", "ESH (except your daughter)\n\nWhat your ex did was awful, I get that. And I get why you don't want her in your life. But she's the closest thing to a mother that your daughter remembers. Forcing her to cut off all contact with the woman who helped raise her is really crappy. I'm not saying your ex deserves to be in your daughter's life, but your daughter deserves to have her mom if she chooses. At 13 she's old enough to understand the circumstances and make a choice for herself.", "YTA.  Don't take your anger with Stephanie out on your daughter.  Seriously, maybe step back and ask your daughter what sort of relationship she wants with Stephanie.  Being a parent means everything isn't about you and your feelings.", "NTA. Talk to a lawyer first. You wouldn't be the first person whose ex child to use the child as a wrapon. If you go that route of letting her have contact, make sure all that shit is in writing and legally binding.

I don't give a damn about your ex, she was an adult who got herself into this situation, but you're being absolutely, devastatingly cruel to your daughter and making her the victim of your separation.\n\nShe already lost one mother, are you really going to make her lose someone else she sees as a mother for your convenience?", "I normally wouldn\u2019t give a YTA in this situation but you are one, and a big one at that. You need to separate your anger with your ex-wife\u2019s recent actions from the relationship your daughter has with her. If you are unable to do that, and quickly by the way, you will damage beyond repair your own relationship with your daughter. In fact, you likely have already done quite a bit of damage as it is with your complete inability to put her needs before yours. \n\nYou also asked what would be the right amount of contact. Your daughter is literally having panic attacks over the separation. Doesn\u2019t that tell you that she needs way more than the token \u2018once a month\u2019 or \u2018twice a month\u2019 you proposed? Please figure out an arrangement that will allow her to see your ex-wife when SHE needs to. \n\nFinally, I fear that you have not taken time with a therapist or counselor to explore why your marriage failed. What led to that outcome? I think that there is a lot more to this story than you are willing to admit in your post.", "Yta. You are punishing your daughter for something you are angry with your ex wife for. Yiu have  right to be angry. But yiur relationship with your ex has nothing do with your daughter's relationship with her. She already lost her birth mother and now you are trying to keep her from having her stepmom. Start loving your daughter more than you hate your ex.", "YTA - you are punishing your daughter for your wife's affair, not just your wife. I get that his is a shit situation and none of your doing but good parents put the wellbeing of their children above their own, even when it hurts.", "YTA \n\nyou\u2019re being petty and have no business telling a 13yr old about the only mother she\u2019s ever known having an affair. it\u2019s emotional incest/parentification when you burden her with adult drama to the point where an THIRTEEN YEAR OLD IS HAVING PANIC ATTACKS", "Yep.  Unfortunately,  You don't get to unilaterally decide to evict people from your daughter's life without feeling the consequences. They shared a relationship and can continue to do so for many many years.  Her biological ties are irrelevant when you admit she's the only mother she remembers.  \nParents have to put their own feelings aside and do what's best for the children.  You said she's always been a good mother. That doesn't change with the divorce.  It's mean and heartless to stand between them, despite your own hurt feelings.  \n\nBeing the better person doesn't feel great all the time, but you already know the answer.", "YTA.\n\nYou divorce adults. Not kids. You are allowing your personal feelings to cause real and lasting harm to your daughter.\n\nStephanie might have done a bad thing to you but you are now doing real harm to your daughter by pushing away the only mother figure she has known. Stephanie WANTS to mother your daughter. Your daughter WANTS Stephanie, a woman who has been her mother actively for many years, to continue mothering her. Your child doesn't care that Stephanie cheated. She cares that she loves Stephanie as her mother and that YOU are the one separating her from her mother for something that has nothing to do with her.\n\nYou have every right to be furious. You have every right to not want Stephanie in your house. But to separate your daughter from her mother figure is cruel to your daughter.", "Nta. Screw the ex. Daughter will get over it eventually. You don't need a bad influence that like in your lives.", "YTA. She was also a parent to your daughter. She was good to her, and she loved her. She's already lost her biological mother, and you're going to take another mother figure away from her out of spite? Shame on you.", "YTA.  This is about your daughter\u2019s needs.  Don\u2019t make her lose two mothers.", "All of you people calling OP the AH forget what happened to him. Infidelity in a relationship is a huge psychological trauma, akin to abuse. Would you invite an abusive spouse back into your life because the kids missed them op you are not the AH", "ESH.. question.. clearly she made an awful wife but how was she as a mother? Did she add value to your daughter\u2019s life? I know you are angry, rightfully so. However, to your daughter your ex was a parental figure that means something to her. It may mean stability and love to her. If your ex was a good mother figure to your daughter try to put your anger aside for your daughter and allow  time with each other. Dinners, lunch\u2019s, or shopping something short. As long as your daughter enjoys the time and your ex doesn\u2019t drag her into anything I think it would benefit your daughter. Over time their relationship may fade, but it won\u2019t be your doing so your daughter won\u2019t carry resentment and pain as much.

You may hate your ex, but to your daughter, she's her mom, not just some random woman. You are taking away the person who is her mother, even though Stephanie isn't her bio-mom. You don't get to decide who your daughter's mom is... only your daughter can.", "YTA. Your daughter needs a woman right now, and out of pettiness and spite you are denying her the only mother she\u2019s ever known.

You have now had to go through two grieving processes. For very different reasons.  \n\nBut your daughter is old enough to choose not to lose the only female parental figure she has truly known. Your ex went about things totally the wrong way. But please make sure that punishing her doesn\u2019t end up leaving your daughter with lifelong issues at a very sensitive time in her life. \n\nCould you stand to go to family counselling with your daughter to see what the counsellor recommends once hearing from you both?

Whether you realize it or accept it or see it, you are hurting your child.\n\nYou said they are close, she did a great job helping to raise her and your daughter views her as a mother. If you continue to hurt your child by keeping the only mother she remembers away from her, your daughter will distance herself from you, the man who hurt her, and you will wonder why doesn\u2019t she talk to you anymore.

What about your daughter? Don\u2019t she deserve a maternal figure in her life?? \n\nYou\u2019ve chosen instead to create a situation where not only will your daughter lose the only maternal figure she\u2019s known, but also reinforce that relationships that matter to her come secondary to other people\u2019s opinion. \n\nNo one said you had to let her have shared custody, she probably doesn\u2019t have the right to.

As a father, he needs to model healthy relationships that will set a good example for his child, and expose his child to the kind of people who will teach her what's right. Stephanie is NOT that person.\n\nThere can be no healthy relationship with Stephanie. What could she possibly offer? Dinner and a movie with her affair partner? It's ludicrous.

I think your daughter is going to be in bad shape without a relationship with her. At the very least, seeing her might help your daughter see who Stephanie is for herself.\n\nNow, I'm not suggesting unsupervised visits, at least not at first. Would you consider for the sake of your daughter speaking to your lawyer about how to set up supervised visitation with someone (preferably female with no relationship with Stephanie)? Strictly for your daughter's sake. I think it would be in her best interests. If you don't believe me, consider discussing that with a therapist that specializes in adolescent development.\n\nPlease also understand that I say this having an enormous amount of empathy for you.

Denying her visitation with your daughter is perfect way to do that. Except you are missing the point in this scenario. You will be emotionally WRECKING your daughter. She will essentially have had TWO mothers ripped from her.\n\nAsk yourself this. Do you hate your ex more than you love your daughter? \n\nOne path: you allow them contact with each other and are civil to her if you interact with her. Your daughter will grow up seeing how MATURE and strong her father is. And how her father prioritized his LOVE for his daughter MORE than he wanted to hurt the woman she sees as her mother.\n\nThe other path. You shut down all contact between them. She either sneaks contact and you blow up at her and it causes a massive rift. Or she grows up feeling abandoned by her mom and she blames YOU for losing her mom. I honestly don\u2019t want to type out the mess you will find yourself in.

Now OP is a widowed divorcee with a 13 year old daughter. The math doesn't add up.\n\n\n ^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post...\n\n  So I(23M) am just starting my first year as a 5th grade teacher. I am really enjoying it so far and my classroom is full of great( though sometimes very rowdy) kids.  I\u2019m obviously still very new at it and am figuring out my teaching style as well as how to maintain the attention and respect of my students. \n\nA big motivator for me is to have a classroom where all my kids can feel comfortable with me and know I\u2019m here to help and guide them, I go out of my way to do fun activities and make most moments teachable lessons whether they directly relate to the subject we are working on, or not.\n\n  One thing I\u2019ve noticed that has caused trouble in my class is that our gym teacher (who is female) consistently shows favoritism to the girls, she always has the girls pick what balls they want before the boys as well as letting them get drinks from the fountain before the boys. This has caused the boys to feel like the girls get special treatment( which they clearly are) and has already caused one of my students to get a suspension for calling it \u201cbullshit\u201d to the teacher.\n\n\n I\u2019ve spoken with our gym teacher about it and she responded by telling me she\u2019s teaching the boys to be \u201cmen\u201d. This got my rather upset as it\u2019s such a ridiculously outdated way of thinking, but as I\u2019m very new I didn\u2019t have the confidence to argue with her.\n\n  So to make things more equal I started letting the boys in our class get lunch before the girls, we eat lunch in our classrooms here right after gym class and I figured it would be a good way to make things more fair. Obviously the girls girls pouted about it at first but none of them have gotten very upset about it.\n\n This has already gotten a few comments from our lunch staff as well as our principle, and while I have not been told directly to stop, it has been heavily implied that I should.  I will not stop however until the boys are given equal treatment in gym class. AITA?\n\nTLDR; AITA for letting the boys get lunch first?\n\n*I am a bot...", "NTA,\n\nStephanie is using your daughter to hurt you, but in the other hand she was her step mother and played a huge motherly role in her life.\n\nYou are in a very hard spot, because your daughter consider her like her mother and theirs nothing you can do about that.\n\nIn the other hand you are justified to not want her in your life completely and legally you can do so.\n\nYour daughter will suffer in either of your decisions. If you want to keep her in your life for the sake of your daughter, your daughter will keep the person she considers \"her mother\" but you will be resentful and intoxicated by her presence and it will be transferred to your daughter.\n\nIf you want to go NC, your daughter might resent you to cut her the \"only mother\" she knew.\n\nIt's up to you to decide what you want to prioritise and whatever the decision that you make, that doesn't make you TA but there will be consequences", "Yta.

However, what you are currently doing is causing greater hurt and pain to your daughter.\n\nIn your misguided effort to protect her, you are causing her pain and grief and panic attacks.\n\nYou do not have to promote your ex\u2019s behavior, you do not have to allow her to have parental rights regarding decisions over your daughter.\n\nBut it would be mighty nice if you to allow them to see each other.  Visit, go to the mall, have dinners.  Just exist in each others life.

But that\u2019s your relationship, that\u2019s not your daughters. \n\nI think you\u2019re being hurt and selfish, personally.", "I don't get why (I'm guessing mostly women here) are saying this guy is the asshole? so he must keep this woman who it turns out is a negative influence in his daughter's life? sounds great. maybe she can even call the guy who his ex-wife fucked her \"step dad\" too.", "YTA\n\nPlease educate yourself on parental alienation.   It is not only a form of child abuse, it is a form of psychological torture for your child.

My wife of 8 years was caught having an affair with another man and when I found that out I was devastated and went immediately to start filing papers. It\u2019s been 4 months since we officially separated and my daughter is taking the lack of maternal figure hard as she\u2019s just starting to hit puberty and it will be harder for her without someone with experience in that regard to guide her.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to go no contact with her but she refuses to leave me and my daughter alone.\nMy daughter was 2 when her mother, the love of my life passed away. About 3 years later I remarried to my now current ex wife Stephanie. She was really close with my daughter and did a great job helping raise her I will admit. My daughter views her as her mother since she was too young to remember her real mother.\n\nSince the separation I\u2019ve been adamant I do not want Stephanie in mine or my daughter\u2019s life. My daughter was heart broken and while she was furious at  Stephanie, she didn\u2019t want to cut her out of her life. I get it\u2019s hard for my daughter who now feels like she\u2019s lost her mother, but the last thing I want is Stephanie to try and act like she has some right to seeing my daughter or for her to try and get my daughter to think I\u2019m at fault for the divorce.\n\nThis week  Stephanie came by the house when I was at work and brought my daughter presents and stayed at the house for several hours waiting for me to come home. I assume she thought since she brought gifts and my daughter was there I\u2019d let her stay. I told Stephanie to leave before I call the police and my daughter started having a panic attack. Stephanie left and on the way out she told my daughter she\u2019d call her. I said no she wasn\u2019t and I\u2019ve since had my daughter\u2019s number changed and deleted Stephanie\u2019s contact from her phone so she couldn\u2019t remember the number.\n\nMy daughter is taking this really hard and I do feel so bad for her, but she needs to understand that Stephanie isn\u2019t her mom, is a bad person, and doesn\u2019t deserve my daughter in her life. \n\nTLDR: Am I the asshole for not letting my ex of 10 years not see my 13 year old daughter anymore?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You can choose to be the AH dad who chose to rip his daughter away to someone she's clearly bonded with. Or you can establish boundaries and try to be better for your daughter.
