If it was so important to him, he could have brought it up.\n\nChange your name, don't change your name. Your choice.\n\nThe ring thing, though. Pride in a marriage? Really?

I think the idea of a woman taking a man's name by default is bs, and I live for the day when it's no longer standard. That day has not come. \n\nThere are communities that think if a woman doesn't take her husband's name, then it means she doesn't actually want the marriage. Which is BS, but if you've ever had to confront a deeply rooted cultural belief, then you should know that it takes time, a lot of self reflection, and space to figure it out.", "YTA\n\nAnd the ONLY reason you are one is because you knew your husband wanted you to take his name and instead of you being upfront about being \"conflicted\" (let's be honest, you weren't, but we can pretend you were), you kept it from him because you knew this would probably affect your relationship. You weren't honest and if you cant' be honest about something this simple, how will your husband continue to trust you", "Yta. You should've said something before you guys were married so he could decide if that something he was ok with.", "NAH\n\nYou claim that you assumed it\u2019s ok to keep your married name.  I have a hard time believing that because the entire wedding process typically includes a lot of comments about names: \u201cOh, three days until you are Mrs Smith\u201d etc.  I don\u2019t believe this literally never came up.  But giving you the benefit of the doubt, you assumed he wouldn\u2019t care.  Meanwhile he assumed you would change your name.\n\nI do think the burden to bring this up ahead of time was slightly more yours than his - if only because his assumption you would take his name is partly based on the fact that the vast majority of women do  - at least in the US.  While no part of me thinks he had any right at all to tell you what you have to do, name wise, I think it would have been far better to bring this up ahead of time and let him adjust his thinking before marriage.  In fairness, though, if this is a big deal to him, he also could have brought it up.\n\nSo NAH but perhaps a lesson learned.  Women struggle with identity and with gender roles throughout their adult lives.  I hope you will discuss all kinds of potential issues in the future.  \n\nDon\u2019t change your name if you don\u2019t want to.  Names are an important part of identify, and you are the only one who cam decide to change it.  Do, however, acknowledge his disappointment and don\u2019t shame him for feeling blindsided.

You waited until after you were married to bring it up. I get the reasons why not, but ultimately it's not a huge deal, and it's on you for not mentioning it when it's common practice.", "YTA for purposefully not communicating this to your husband prior to getting married. This is traditional and if you felt differently about tradition then you should have let him know. The reasons for not changing don't matter because you didn't communicate it to him beforehand. That's the real issue. If this is how you handle important situations I'd probably be upset too. It shows that you don't find his opinion important and you don't care about his feelings. Also, I do think you're overthinking and overreacting to changing your name. Not saying you should change it but that you are overthinking it. We do live in the 21st century but that doesn't mean all traditions have the same meaning they did hundreds of years ago. To say women that change their name do it because they're somebody's property is very antiquated of you.", "Soft YTA Many men, even those who are by no means considered traditional, would feel that this is a rejection on a fundamental level. In our culture, it is what's normally done. Aside from the reasons why it started, taking your husband's name is still a declaration to the world that you are one family. That's why this is really something that should be worked out before you get married, since it can be so emotional.\n\nIt is a PITA to change your name, but it does make a lot of things easier. Wherever you go people will assume your last name is the same as your husband's anyway. When you have children together, it makes it much easier if you all have the same name and people won't question your relationship to your child.\n\nWhat I did was keep my last name as my middle name so if I happened to come across a situation where I forgot to change my name on something it was easy to show I was really me. That also helped keep some name continuity on degrees or certificates I've received. I also kept my maiden name for professional purposes. It all worked out pretty seamlessly by allowing me to keep my professional identity consistent while making my husband happy about having the same name in our personal life. Maybe you could work out a similar compromise?", "Why not suggest to him that you both take a new last name? You\u2019ll have to get a court order, but it\u2019s doable.

It is your name and you don't want to lose it. That should be enough for him.", "NTA. He shouldn\u2019t have assumed you would. He should have discussed his expectations with you. You shouldn\u2019t change your name if you don\u2019t want to.", "NTA\n\nWhy do people still insist on these mideavel ways. \"Tradition\" does not translate to \"good\". More often it translates to \"they didn't know better back then\".\n\nTell him you are doing your part by wearing your wedding ring.", "I loathe \u201cthis is they way it\u2019s always been done\u201d as a justification for anything. \n\nESH because you all should have had this discussion before you exchanged vows.\n\nMy husband said if I didn\u2019t change my name I\u2019d lose a half a carat. Lol. I didn\u2019t really care either way so I changed my name. I\u2019m also pretty sure he was kidding.", "NTA - please explain to him how involved the process for changing your name would be. You have to report to every government agency, every financial institution, and probably anywhere you would have a license with your maiden name. And you have to do it in the right order.", "Call his bluff. Ask him if he doesn't think wearing a ring is important to show pride in a marriage then he doesn't have to wear one. And when he removes his ring, also stop wearing yours too. See how pissed off he gets. I'm petty like that.\n\nAlso NTA on the name thing.", "YTA.\n\nYes I know it's your name and your decision to make, etc etc. That's not why you're the asshole - it's because you didn't tell him before getting married and let him go on thinking that you would change your name - which, despite how often this topic comes up on Aita, the default still is that the woman would change her name.\n\nAlso I don't really see how the ring thing is any different.", "NTA because it is very outdated to have to change your last name and you are your own person. He shouldn't force his sexist views on you in this respect. However, you should also not force him to wear a ring, which is also just a tradition. You do not have to show that you're proud to be married by changing your last name, he does not have to show it by wearing a ring.", "NTA.  There is no rule that says you need to change your last name.  He could have married his sister.  She has the same last name!", "NTA. But this is why premarital counseling should really be more important to people. There are lots of \u201clittle things\u201d that might actually be big problems in a relationship. By \u201cits tradition\u201d did he actually mean he\u2019d always envisioned a Mrs. Husband on his arm and now he has to readjust his perspective of what that sounds like? Like I said, NTA, but the time to have that conversation was when you first started wondering if you wanted to change your name- when you could listen to his opinions and feelings and then make a decision that took that into consideration- even if it was still not what he wanted. That goes for future potential problems that might arise too. Being married is living both your own lives AND your lives together. It takes a lot of compromise and you can\u2019t do that when you don\u2019t even leave space to hear the other persons input.", "INFO: Did he express his expectation before marriage? \n\nIf yes, then E S H. You because lying by omission is not okay. He because it\u2019s not a fair expectation and absolutely outdated and your reasons outweigh his by far, as other have explained much better then I could. Plus I would be interested what he means by \u201ccompromise\u201d; let me guess, he is one of the people that use the word as a euphemism for \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d. \n\nIf you both avoided the topic and he just expected you to take his name because \u201ctraditions\u201d then N T A.", "NTA this dude should change his name to match yours if he thinks y\u2019all should have the same last name. Anyone who pressures others into doing stuff they don\u2019t want to do for no other reason than \u201ctradition\u201d is a complete tool. If he had the expectation for you to change such a huge aspect of your identity that\u2019s on him.", "This! 100%", "This was my thought too. NTA over not wanting to change her name. but she is the Ah for requiring him to wear a ring. I\u2019m surprised more people aren\u2019t mentioning the ring thing.", "Shouldn\u2019t she have brought this up before the wedding? What if this is a huge deal breaker for him and he was unaware until after? You can\u2019t call him an asshole for expecting something she refused to communicate.", "Nah, the hyphenated name thing is stupid, too.\n\nWhy should a woman be burdened with a hyphenated name because her husband is an ass?", "Yeah.. husband sound sexist af", "Things you should speak about\u2026.", "This is the way. Legally keep your name, but socially use husband's name. \n\nHe is a dick for insisting though. For sure a convo before marriage was warranted here. You just assumed he wouldn't care \n\nNTA, but work on that communication!", "She\u2019s a bit of an AH for insisting he wears a ring when he doesn\u2019t want to.\n\nEverything else in your comment I agree with 100%.", "This might not be true depending on where OP lives. It\u2019s not the case in my country.", "I was not aware of this, but our marriage certificate has my maiden name. Thanks for the info though", "You don\u2019t have to. You CAN. And it makes the name change process more streamlined. But plenty of people change it afterwards.", "This isn't true. My certificate is my legal name only.", "Not where I got married.", "We don\u2019t want to have children so it\u2019s out of the question, but I wouldn\u2019t be bothered if we did and they had his last name. I don\u2019t have any qualms with his family, I don\u2019t mind being called \u201cMrs. [husband last name]\u201d, I\u2019ve even changed my name to his last name as mine on my social media accounts already. I don\u2019t have a problem with having his last name socially, I just like my name and family, and have other professional reasons for not wanting to change my name.", "This is not true. I didn\u2019t keep it from him because I knew it would affect our relationship. I legitimately thought he wouldn\u2019t care and I\u2019m very surprised he does. Yeah I admit I should have said something sooner but I didn\u2019t think it would matter so I didn\u2019t. That\u2019s all it is.", "He did not", "100% She wants him to wear the ring so everyone knows he's married. Its total double standards.", "If it was such a huge deal breaker for him then I guess he should have brought it up. If she is anything like me it would have never crossed my mind", "You can be an asshole for your deal breakers if they are sexist. The only compelling reason OP should have brought it up before was so that she could avoid marrying a sexist.", "Well I'm going NTA then.  Something that probably should have been discussed before hand but it's your decision.", "I wasn\u2019t not honest either, it\u2019s not something we ever even discussed.", "Oh well then absolutely NTA. He can\u2019t just go around and expect this of you without even asking. Wrong century. Sure you could\u2019ve talked about it but as you are the one that doesn\u2019t want any changes it\u2019s not your responsibility, the one that expects sacrifices / changes is in charge of initiating the conversation. The audacity\u2026\n\nI might be petty but honestly at this point I wouldn\u2019t give in out of principle.", "But she literally said she thought about it and didn\u2019t bring it up. And it\u2019s such an expected thing that it should be brought up if she didn\u2019t want to do it and allow him to make the decision. These are things you communicate about before getting married. We have no idea if he would have gone through with the wedding or if he would have come to terms with it but she removed his ability to do so by not communicating it with him. I just don\u2019t see how her refusing to communicate in the relationship doesn\u2019t also make her an asshole. She\u2019s not an asshole for not wanting to do it.", "I'm not sure where you live but in the US it is completely bog standard to retain your maiden name. Having a serious preference for your wife taking your name is pretty rare.", "\"In the US, most women adopt their husband\u2019s family name when they get married \u2013 around 70%, according to one of the largest data analyses in recent years.\" - BBC Article from 2020 (https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200921-why-do-women-still-change-their-names) I agree that OP is completely justified in wanting to keep her maiden name, I just want to point out that if anything is the standard, then it is the woman changing her last name.", "I honestly had no idea. I can't think of any couple in my children's generation that actually changed their names but maybe I'm hanging out in the wrong circles \ud83d\ude02"]}
