I not only think you are right on this. I do think you need to call child protective services and tell them your whole story. Someone needs to look out for this unborn child of your mothers and for your younger brother. You might also want to consider relocating temporarily and staying with a friend or maybe your grandmother, if she still with you, because it sounds like this might actually be a safety issue. By the way, I think that enhances your story for Child protective services if that\u2019s the way you choose to go.", "NTA - that's rough. It's the parent's job to take care of you, not the reverse. You only get to be young once. Get yourself in a better position for your life. That doesn't mean abandon your family necessarily, but you definitely need to help yourself. No one else will.", "NTA \n\nPlease tell your school counselor and/or the principal about your home life and everything that's happened. Call child protective services.

This sounds really unfortunate and I\u2019m so sorry.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nWhat you said to your mom is justified \u2013 if she can't take care of her own children, you shouldn't be responsible for them either. I hope the best for you.", "NTA,\nThis post has my blood boiling. I can heavily relate to you and in your best interest, you should follow through with emancipation. Anyone who allows their children to go through this is not anyone worth being a mother. Especially ESPECIALLY if she knows what her boyfriend's friends did to your things. I would immediately have filed a police report if I had enough evidence against them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm sure you'll be able to talk about that with someone at child protective services, or your grandma if possible.\n\nNTA.", "Agree with everything here.  Good luck to you. You deserve the best.  Speak to CPS.  They should be able to provide information to guide you. Look for free legal aid near you or online too.", "And especially make sure about the money because my friend was emancipated legally from a physically abusive household and since we were dumb kids, we didn't realize she couldn't afford to live on her own. She got her home broken into, couldn't afford to keep things up, wound up on the street for a bit, and ended up having to go back to live in her abusers home.

I\u2019m the second oldest of 8 and helping with my younger siblings was expected but it was constant. I didn\u2019t have a childhood. My father did well and my mom stayed home with us but so many kids meant my time was spent \u201chelping\u201d all of the time.

Good luck.", "Very much NTA.\n\nYour mother is neglecting and parentifying you. She is failing you in so many ways. if your grandma is still around, see if she can support you. Ask her to help you report your mother to CPS, to see what can be done for your brother and the unborn baby. If your grandma or another relative could take you/them in, that could be good too. Emancipation can be tough - though still better than what you're dealing with.", "NTA, I am so sorry that you have had to grow up like this. I personally agree with another post about talking to a school counselor.  Maybe they can give you some info on where to start.", "NTA\n\nI'd suggest to move somewhere else and not tell your mum the address this time around.", "And for you.

You moms actions strikes one as irresponsible and callous.\n\nI would just advise you to move out once you're 18.", "NTA. Please call CPS or it\u2019s equivalent in your country.

Can your grandma help with this?", "Not going to offer any judgment here because if this is legitimate this is Way beyond am I the assholes pay grade\n\nGet cps involved now", "NTA. Do you have the option to go live with your grandma? Is there someone you can call for support? I\u2019m concerned for you and your siblings. It sounds like it would best for child services to be involved especially for your siblings in the event you get emancipated", "NTA, the sad part though is someone out there is still gonna scream \"eugenics\"", "NTA Yeah, at this point, time to call CPS.", "NTA call CPS go and live with your granny.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMake your escape from those AHs any way you can.", "NTA.
