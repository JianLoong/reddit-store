Did you even show him the picture to get his opinion? I have PLENTY of photos I look horrific in, but the reason I have them is for the memories. Seems like you just don't like your BIL.", "YTA and you know you are. \n\n\"I cropped my BIL out of a picture because I thought he was ugly and didn't want his face to ruin my perfect holiday moment.\"", "YTA - purposely cropping someone out of a photo and then posting that photo on Facebook where they can see it is just an AH move.  I was expecting you to say your BIL did something horrible during the trip and you didn\u2019t want him in the photo, not that you thought he looked bad in it.", "Of course YTA, did you actually expect a different result?", "YTA. Not everyone has the same personal hang ups about their appearance and you didn\u2019t even give him a head\u2019s up about the \u201cfavor\u201d \ud83d\ude44 you did him\u2026I think I would be feeling hurt, too. It\u2019s not like he was some strange rando you didn\u2019t know photobombing the background.", "YTA sorry.  Just because your BIL wasn't looking his best was no reason to photoshop him out of the picture.  His anger is completely justified imo.", "YTA. You cropped him out of a family photo because of personal opinions. Doing so without consulting the person who was the subject of such. Then posted it publicly online. Whether or not you did this maliciously or with the best of intentions. It comes off a a slap to the face and an insult. If you would like to fix this, you should probably take the photo you posted down. Then post the original photo with an apology that you had cut your BIL out of the photo previously and that while your intention was not to hurt anyone in the process, you did just that, and that you are sorry for doing so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Edit\\* Clunky sentence structure for lack of morning coffee.", "YTA.  If you genuinely thought he would be mortified about his appearance, you should have asked.  Screw the \"perfect\" picture, BS; that sentiment is where this mess originated from.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: spelling", "Did you think about sending the pic to your BiL to ask if he minded if you posted the pic or wanted to be cropped out? Without any explanation beforehand, I can see why his feelings would be so hurt. He might think that what you\u2019re telling him now is an excuse. I think he\u2019s being a little extreme saying he won\u2019t go to thanksgiving, but again if he thinks he wasn\u2019t wanted on the family vacay I understand why. Sounds like your intentions weren\u2019t ill, but you really should have consulted with him before cropping him out. YTA.", "YTA. Don't you think about using your powers for good? You could have just cleaned him up if you felt so strongly about it. I mean, it's still a bad idea without broaching the subject, but now you just seem thoughtless and cold.", "You photoshopped him out, and then you posted it where everyone could see it? Wow. You\u2019re beyond TA.", "Mmm I'll say YTA, if you wanted him cropped for your personal memories or whatever that's fine but I wouldn't have posted it on Facebook or somewhere he would see. I can see how he feels awkward and unwanted.", "YTA- part of having memories and photos to look back on is they capture all the moments of our lives, the good, the bad, the ugly.... photos aren't perfect.  \n\n\nHonestly it does look like you didn't want him there", "Yeah, YTA.", "YTA, obviously.\n\nIf you wanted to do that for a picture to keep on your desk in your office, or on your bedside dresser, that's fine, I don't really have a problem with it. \n\nBut to do it and POST IT ONLINE? \n\nWhat were you thinking?", "i mean yeah YTA but i get it. i would do it too \ud83e\udee3 but i\u2019ve cropped MYSELF out too so sometimes it\u2019s just how the picture looks. i mean you have the original i\u2019m assuming so it\u2019s not like he\u2019s gone forever. just the one you have.", "YTA You sound horrible", "YTA yes", "YTA because you were insensitive and you want justification from Redding on your actions.   \nYou're not thinking about how your sister and brother-in-law FEEL, so you're missing the point. They don't share angle of consideration so what would have been better was for you to send or show the photo to them and ask your sister and brother-in-law whether it's OK to share this on social media.  Or the better solution was to offer to do photoshop on your brother to get that \"jelly out of his nose\". Cropping someone out of a group photo is a great way to say \"F-U\" without actually saying it, in this day and age of social media.", "YTA.\n\nYou took this cherished awesome moment and then cropped out ONE person from the photo.  I mean...what?  You purposefully cropped him out!\n\nOf course you're an asshole.  I don't care how bad he looked that was super hurtful.", "Soft YTA, because your intention sounds pure. Dude, just ask next time. This would have been a non issue had you just asked what he\u2019d prefer.", "Soft YTA. I get it but since it's everyone's favorite picture why not get someone to photoshop the jelly off his nose and include everyone?", "YTA.  That was really mean, and you sound incredibly shallow.   \n\n\nThe point of a picture at a family vacation isn't for your perfect instagram moment, it's to look back and remember times with loved ones fondly.   You made it clear 'aesthetic' was more important than an actual living, breathing human being with feelings.  You treated him like unwanted garbage.   \n\n\nYou owe that man an ENORMOUS apology.  Start working on your grand gesture, asshole.", "NTA", "YTA because you made a lot of assumptions. You cut him out because you thought he wouldn't like it \u2014 but instead he ended up being hurt. You should've either not posted it at all, or posted it and if he didn't like it and asked you to crop it, then you could've complied. Instead, it does seem like you didn't want him there.", "YTA and shame on you. Just because you don't think he looked good enough to be in a picture you took him out. He may not have looked good but I bet he is a lot better of a person than you are.", "And your attitude is worse. YTA.", "So you want the photos to imagine that you had a perfect time that in fact never existed? That\u00b4s insane.", "Going against the grain to say NAH/ESH. Whether or not he looked bad might be subjective in this instance; he and your sister have seen it and apparently still would have preferred for to have been left in it while you thought you were doing him a favor. (The fact that she says that's not the point indicates that she agrees he looks crappy, but as she says, that's not the priority factor.) But now that you've explained and shown them the picture, it seems odd to me that he's still taking this as a sign that you (*and your parents?* how did he bring them into it?) didn't even want him on the vacation to begin with and is therefore threatening to boycott Thanksgiving? Too much; he needs to relax. \n\nI'd say repost the full pic with apologies to your BIL and a note that he's beloved. Call him up apologize, say of course you want him at family get togethers, and you thought you were having his back, but next time you're in a similar situation, you'll just ask.", "NTA", "NTA - This guy is going to boycott Thanksgiving and punish the whole family because you cropped him out of a picture you posted on Facebook?  UGH, he needs to grow up! \n\nI get that his feelings are hurt, but he's blowing this way out of proportion because he has a fragile ego.", "NTA. If he wants to be in pictures, be picture ready. Is this for a picture hanging on your house? If so, NTA. To post a picture you cropped him out of with no notice is really mean.", "Dudes, if I looked like that, I would be so grateful to be cropped out!  I think the only error is not saying something before posting it.", "NTA for cropping.  Maybe you should\u2019ve posted both on FB, but he seems like a drama Queen for refusing to go to Thanksgiving\u2026why punish your parents and the rest of the family", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
