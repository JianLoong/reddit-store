We\u2019re both from Florida but moved to another state a year ago. We jointly own a house back in Florida, which we turned into a rental property and rents out to Hubert, a retiree who is in his 80s and is a very good tenant. Hubert has no family or people taking care of him, he can move himself around and live on his own okay, but is pretty frail so whenever my wife and I travel back to Florida, which is pretty frequent, we usually check in on him, bring him meals, fix whatever he needs around the house, etc.\n\n\r  \nMy mother-in-law has been over to our house in Florida many times when we still lived there. She has been hinting recently that since she is retiring soon, she wants to move into the house and rent from us, which both my wife and I think is a bad idea because MIL is saying she\u2019ll pay rent now but we both know that\u2019s not going to stick for long before she started living there rent free because we are faaaaaamily. MIL has also mentioned to other people in the family that once Hubert isn\u2019t renting the house anymore, which won\u2019t be very long because of how frail he is, she plans on arranging with my wife and I to move in. \n\n\r  \nLast week MIL saw Hubert very briefly while we stopped by the house so I can fix something for him.

That comment rubs me the wrong way because I know exactly where she is going with this, so I told her to mind her own business and Hubert can die in the house if he wants to, I am not asking him to move out, and it\u2019s really none of her concern. MIL then said God wouldn\u2019t want me speaking to an elder in that manner, and I responded that God wouldn\u2019t want her banking on an elderly to die. That made her really mad and she hasn't talked to me since. My wife is on my side and has spoken up for me to her mother multiple times before in the past, but for this specific situation, we both have pre-discussed and agreed I would take a bit more of the heat and the lead in saying no we are entertaining MIL wanting Hubert to move out.
