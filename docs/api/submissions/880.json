The fact that you know how much they earn makes me think you want to talk a lot about it, seems weird to me. Money is always a difficult issue. Every marriage has the right to put their own rules about finances, theirs are none of your business. I know you were talking about it, but you are actually nobody to tell if their finances are fair or not. They are fair for them and that's all that matters.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is no such thing as \"FAIR\" - only what the couple agrees on.", "\u201cBut I pushed the question a little more.\u201d -YTA. Read the room man. What works for them works for them and she clearly didn\u2019t want to have to explain herself. Did you ever think it could be a sore subject between them? Or maybe there are some financial issues that you don\u2019t know about that might make it better for them, like maybe she had a lot of student loans and for her to pay more wouldn\u2019t be possible? I\u2019m making stuff up, but you just needed to pipe down. Discussing personal finance, politics and religion are off the table young lady. \n\nTo be honest, I\u2019ve never understood the splitting anyhow. Our money goes into one big pot and my wife, who is the more responsible one, pays the bills on time and tells me how much I can spend. It works for us because if we did it any other way, I\u2019d bankrupt the family or be broke, lol. \n\nSend Kim some flowers and a card that says, \u201cThese are 100% yours. \ud83d\ude02 I\u2019m sorry, (your name)\u201d", "You know YTA. Why would you push? Is it because you\u2019re scared your bf will make you pay 50%?", "YTA, if thats how they wanna do it so be it.  It's none of your business.", "YTA. It's none of your business. She told you to mind your business and you didn't. She gave you a nasty look you didn't care, she told you it wasn't your business you didn't care you then still proceed to tell her it isn't fair and you didn't care. Girl read the damn room and shut your mouth good God.", "YTA\n\nAs soon as she gave you \"a look\" you should have dropped it. It was quite clear that your question was an issue and you decided to push the issue. Fact is, she was right. It was none of your business. If the two of them agreed on it, that's all that matters. \n\nIMO, it totally depends on their finances. If I make 60k and my wife makes 115k but our bills are low enough that it's not causing any issues, I don't see anything wrong with it. As long as it's not putting one party in the poor house, let them do what they want. The way I see it, making one person pay more is in a way punishing the other for being more successful.", "YTA None of your friggin Business.", "YTA.\n\nI make less than my boyfriend and I would never ask him to pay more than 50-50 because I don't want to feel like I'm taking advantage of him (not saying you are, just that I would feel that way if I don't contribute equally). They likely have a reason, and they don't have to share if they don't want to.", "YTA. You noticed the dirty look so why did you keep pushing. And after she said it wasn't your business you still kept pushing. Take a hint.", "YTA. Finances isn't the ONLY way to contribute. There's also house chores, cooking, laundry, childcare (if there's kids) etc. One might be paying more while the other runs the household more. People decide what works for THEM. You pushing the subject without taking a hint makes you tactless and an AH.", "YTA sorry but, like he said I don't think it's any of your buisness. If it was something that was a problem in their relationship then something would have already been done about it already. Also, pushing the question when you obviously understood the reaction in the first place, is a bit silly. It isn't your job to enforce your opinion on someone else's relationship, you may have your belief, but it doesn't apply to everyone else.", "YTA. It's not up to you to decide what's fair and what's not for anyone else. You do it your way, they do its theirs. You overstepped big time by pushing after you saw her reaction, and for judging their setup.", "I think YTA for \u201cpushing a little more\u201d after you noticed your friend\u2019s dirty look. This is something you should have changed the subject over and then talked about it with your spouse on the way home.", "YTA - a brief conversation does not give the nuances of how they split finances. \u201cExpenses\u201d could mean a lot and it\u2019s not your place to provide judgement or commentary.", "YTA. Their finances are none of your business, and, technically speaking, she is already breaking gender stereotypes by making such a significant amount more than her husband. It could also be a sore spot because Kim doesn't -want- to pay more than 50%, and because that system works for them as a couple, you should butt out, even if your intentions are good.", "YTA. Different relationships have different rules. Not everyone splits based on income, some people keep their finances separate. It depends on what the people in the relationship agree to. If Kim doesn\u2019t want to fork over more than 50% for the expenses then she shouldn\u2019t and it\u2019s none of your business if that\u2019s what she wants to do.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You don\u2019t need to police what works for them. Are you worried she\u2019s scamming him? Or just not following your \u201cgender roles\u201d comment? They assumably had their negotiations about finances and you need to keep your nose out of it. It\u2019s not so black and white.", "YTA.  Their finances are there own business.  You can judge if you like, but do it in private.", "Look YTA, because if they want to do separate finances that's none of your business, especially as they are both working.\n\nNo one appears to be getting taken advantage of financially here, and the husband does not appear to be financially manipulated.\n\nI'm curious if you would have spoken up if the gender pay gap was reversed.", "YTA for talking about their finances, all you had to say was that you and your husband determined the percentage split for your expenses based on your earnings as that was what you both deemed fair, otherwise one person could potentially be left with nothing after paying bills if you went 50:50 split.  The topic should then have been closed and it was up to Aiden to raise it with Kim if he felt they needed to review their finances.", "ESH (you and Kim, more specifically), I think Kim is an asshole for having a 50/50 split when she makes more than twice the amount. \n\nHowever, I do think that calling someone out directly on how they handle their financial business, is indeed not your place: you could have made your point by not asking her that specific question and then trying to push it. Everything you stated before already made the point perfectly and left the door open for Aiden to adress it in private, if he wanted to.\n\nAsking her directly in public was not ever going to be taken by anyone well and you should have read the room and dropped it when you saw that Kim was already defensive. If Aiden now wants to adress it, he's likely going to get in argument himself because of this incident.", "NTA \nWould people be saying a-hole if the roles were reversed and the husband was earning 45k more than their wife and still demanding 50/50 split?", "YTA", "NTA. It was all fun and games when they were discussing your finances but theirs are off limits. That doesn't hold and friends keep eachother accountable. Kim knows she's being unfair and hates being called out.", "NTA, because proportional splitting is usually the most fair way to do things\u2014with a big difference like theirs, your friend is keeping her husband poor and limiting his ability to pursue interests. She should want him to have enough extra money to live a little.", "NTA. But I doubt Kim's SO knows exactly how much more she makes then him. I'm pretty sure you just made the husband start thinking a lot more closely about the finances of his household after that eruption though.", "NTA, she called her friend out for her hypocrisy.", "NTA\n\nYou're seeking equality, while Kim is content to profit from traditional gender roles, when it suits her.\n\nNot exactly sure who would be TA here, because it would be influenced heavily by nuances in the conversation.\n\nIf you were playing \"dog with a bone\" and pointing blame fingers - it is you.\n\nSeems to me, it may have been Aiden - bringing the topic up, in a round about way, but with the ulterior motive of getting you to fight a battle he saw no way of winning solo.", "NTA. Feminism is only convenient until it is not.", "NTA... Because you're very close. Close friends hold each other to account. \n\nYou probably should have waited until it was just you two to press the issue, though.", "NTA I'd be doing the same I think the attitude in the comments would be different if Kim was a dude.", " A couple who doesn't go by 50/50 to split the expenses and consider each other's need as well. It sounds pretty awesome. But is it necessary for Kim and Aiden to do the same? Will there be any major change with this in their expenses? If things would become more easier for them then it's sort of understandable, but if there's no major change and none of them minds how they currently split the expenses then you might have looked like a friend projecting your own beliefs on them. Since Kim is the one who gets paid more, to her it might have seemed like you were saying she's wrong for that, which does make you a little bit of AH.", "so you guys talk about demolishing traditional gender roles but in reality she just wants to demolish traditional gender roles that don't benefit her. This was an open discussion you were all having so bringing it up wasn't an AH move. Instead of her expanding on why this works for them she got mad.", "YTA", "Yta. How they split their finances isn't any of your business. As long as they are both happy, there isn't a wrong way of splitting bills.", "YTA - why do you care? It\u2019s one thing to share and a whole other thing to judge. There\u2019s a lot more that goes into a marriage than just money - you aren\u2019t privy to how they share the load. It\u2019s between them.\n\nAlso making me feel strange that husband and I are fully combined. There\u2019s no spilt of his money and my money it\u2019s all in one spot. We started out the first few years of our marriage where I was the higher earned and paid a higher percentage on my insistence, now he makes far far more and it\u2019s all just blended.

She had had an abortion earlier in life but suddenly and decided other women couldn\u2019t be trusted to do the right thing.\n\nI called her on it just as you have.

For pushing question little more.\n\nBTW 50/50 IS FAIR. Both my girlfriend and I works freelance. So years to years they can have huge difference between us, on one side or the other. But at anytime none of us use more or less house thant the other, or the electricity or water or wathever bills comming. We made budget with the lowest income and any extras is free to each. \n\nSo, sometimes I pay for her dinner, sometimes it's her. But sometimes it's both.", "You can't fairly judge the way they live if you do not know all the details. And Y T A for that.\nFor examples: do they split the chores 50/50 or does she contribute more? This alone could explain she doesn't want to contribute more financially. Also, how were things before she earning more? If he was previously the one earning more and they agreed on 50/50, I would understand that now she wants to keep 50/50.\nNow, if you know and take into account the whole picture, I would say N T A as you did well by pointing an unfair situation.", "This. Especially with the comment on breaking gender roles. They are 50/50 he\u2019s not supporting her, what was even the end goal of that questioning.", "Okay, then why was she talking about them openly up to that point? Including discussing OP's financial details? It was her business until she said something she didn't like, and then suddenly it's hostility for continuing the discussion they'd been participating in.\n\nMaybe if the hostility had started after pushing, not when it started immediately on asking a simple why.", "I was just going to say the same~or ask the question...doesn't any couple (married)consider it their money no matter who makes what? \nTho I'll be honest ~I Had a hard time getting used to thinking about it like that after we married for a while & when I worked...tho we never split the household bills or anything like that...money went in the bank...bills were paid. He made a lot more than I did as I worked part-time after I had our kids...but he was the one who would say it's not your's ~it's not mine...it's ours. We've been married a bit over 25 years now...it's worked for us\ud83d\ude42.I'm retired (my husband still works)...I pay all the bills and keep track of everything...he has no clue how much an electric bill would cost...lol", "The question is not AITA for splitting finances 50/50, it's AITA for insisting my friend should separate her finances differently. \n\nWe don't know the conditions of their agreement. Maybe it's always been 50/50, and Kim used to be the one making less money before. Maybe is unfair to Aidan entirely. Maybe Kim is still paying her master's, who knows? But OP pushed when it was clear that the topic was something that Kim didn't want to discuss.", "I would hope so."]}
