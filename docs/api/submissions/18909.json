Training has been difficult, but it's for a good cause (cancer research), so I'm happy to take part.\n\nMy GF (F27) has been super supportive. She's been making me the proper food and helping me manage the increase in laundry loads that my routine has created. The problem started last night. I planned on going to bed early so that I could wake up early to train, as I was planning on increasing my mileage the next day.\n\nMy GF wanted to hang out Friday night (since we both had busy work weeks), and I agreed on the condition that I would have to go to bed early. We decided that it would be best if we stayed home and watched a movie, as this would ensure I could go to bed early. Once it got to 10 pm, I said I'd be going to bed. My GF wanted me to stay longer, but I told her about the next day's training and went to bed. She wasn't too happy about this, so I promised her that we would do something the next night.\n\nThe next day, I went on my run. It was super humid and started to rain, so I got drenched and had a decent amount of mud on me when I got back to our apartment. I got back exhausted and starving, so I threw my clothes in the corner and went to the kitchen. We hadn't gone grocery shopping yet, so there wasn't much in the fridge.\n\nMy GF, hearing the noise, came out to see me. She told me that I had left a dirty pile of laundry in the hall and that I had tracked mud into the kitchen. I apologized and said I would clean up as soon as I ate and had a shower. I then asked if she could possibly make me something to eat. She sort of stood there shaking her head. I tried to give her a hug, but she pulled away and said that I was sweaty and gross and that I didn't care about how much work she was doing.\n\nWhen I said I did care, she said, \"BS,\" and locked herself in our bedroom.

You decided to gain a hobby that made a bunch of work for her and requires a large amount of time away when she seems to need more quality time together. And you seem pretty ungrateful and like this is just a normal thing a girlfriend should do labor over if she\u2019s a good girlfriend. She\u2019s not your mother. You\u2019re acting like a little boy after soccer practice. Pick up after yourself and make your own food. She doesn\u2019t get compensated in any way, you can\u2019t even make time for her.", "YTA. She\u2019s being super supportive and you\u2019re taking advantage. You literally got home, threw dirty clothes on the floor, tracked mud everywhere, then told her to make you food. On top of that, you\u2019re not spending much time with her. You really don\u2019t see the problem here? You\u2019re treating her like she\u2019s your personal assistant, not your girlfriend. Apologize and go make *her* some food.", ">have been training for a half marathon for the past two months.\n\nYTA.  This is something you are doing because you want to do it.  You're making a stupid half marathon your priority and she keeps putting up with the loss of time and affection.  You come home from your \"hobby\" that surely is annoying the hell out of her, you come home, leave dirty clothes there, track mud around, and then have the audacity to say \"get in the kitchen and fix me some pie\" like some Cartman reject and she looks at you like you've lost your damned mind.  She should have.  Cook your own damned lunch.", "You sound like my college ex. When he was studying for the MCAT, I had to revolve my life around his study schedule/needs. I was happy to do that. However, one night I told him I had plans with a friend to hang out and he got upset acting like I hadn't been ensuring we were only hanging out when he was available. \n\nYour girlfriend seems to go above and beyond and you take advantage of that. You're expecting her to revolve her life around something YOU want to do. It's very easy for you to still do your own laundry and not track mud in the kitchen. You can absolutely still be an adult and do things to help out. You're not running every part of every day. My current SO is a runner and he lives alone and still manages to do chores and such. \n\nYTA", "Yes\u2026 why can\u2019t you put your dirty clothes in the hamper / washer, clean the muddy tracks on the floor, order Uber Eats, and hop in the shower?", "YTA..Lmao why does she need to be the one making you food all the time? It\u2019s a nice gesture but you\u2019re not entitled to it. Do it yourself. Also \u2018increase in laundry load\u2019 is hilarious, like an extra t shirt and shorts a day? You don\u2019t need to \u2018manage\u2019 that unless you\u2019re totally incompetent already. I\u2019m gonna guess she\u2019s sick of cleaning up after you and the day you came storming in after your activity that YOU chose to do before leaving a filthy pile of clothes in the entrance to your home and making the floors muddy made her realise you feel entitled to her cleaning up after you. If you can\u2019t take responsibility for your hobbies, you shouldn\u2019t have them. You should have made food before you left because you knew you\u2019d be hungry, or picked something up. She\u2019s right to be annoyed and you need to apologise.", "Not enough info but from what you said\u2026 \nYTA it sounds like she is doing A-LOT for you - laundry, cooking, etc. \nShe wants to spend time with you and you want to\u2026 train", "YTA. Training for a half marathon is not some massive endeavour that requires a support team to devote their time to your every need. I trained for a half while doing finals and then moving to a new city to start a very intensive job in healthcare (long shifts, physical work, emotionally hard). No one did any of this stuff for me, and I managed perfectly well to do my own laundry and cook my own meals. You're adding extra work for her for no reason.", "It doesn't really matter if reddit thinks you're an asshole here or not. Either way, your girlfriend clearly feels undervalued in your relationship. Get off of reddit and talk to her to figure out how you can help her feel more valued.", "Why is he talking like he\u2019s Rocky preparing to fight on behalf of America taking on the Russian Drago?\n\nIt\u2019s a half marathon charity run. No one cares about your training. Eat a granola bar and do your damn laundry", "YTA. It's great that she's supporting your training, but it sounds like you're just expecting her to do things that you can easily do yourself just because your 'training'. Your training for a marathon, it shouldn't be consuming your life to the point that you need someone to mother you and manage your time.", "YTA. You sound like you think your performance in the race could cure cancer, while the truth is if you had just donated money instead of buying running shoes and clothes you would have made a bigger impact. Get off your high horse, admit it\u2019s just a hobby you enjoy (which is great!) and spend some quality time with your GF.", "YTA. She sounds extremely supportive, and her reaction makes the impression that you don\u2019t make her feel appreciated.\nMake some damn food yourself", "YTA.\n\nDude, you are only training for a half Marathon, not an Iron Man. You do not need your GF or anyone as a 24/7 service provider. Everything she does is a huge benefit for your and you should be thankful.", "YTA. I\u2019m a runner who has completed several marathons and 30+ half marathons. Training can be hard but not so hard that you can\u2019t manage to take care of yourself afterwards. She\u2019s already being great about supporting your goal. You\u2019re asking too much.", "You lost me when you said she had been helping you with the increase in laundry. You are grown man, why do you need help with laundry? Didn\u2019t need to hear any more. YTA", "YTA. I ran ultramarathons (50K & 50 milers) where I was training up to 80 miles a week. I did all my own laundry, kept myself fed, & took care of the animals/our apt while working full time. I typically didn't even have my partner drive me to the races/spectate bc they were trail races in the woods & I was running 6-13 hrs; boring for him.\n\nIf you're running more than an hour & not bringing fuel, start doing that. You're going to feel much less weak & bonky post-run if you're eating a GU or 2 while training. Buy some easy to eat carb-heavy/protein snacks so you can grab a quick bite right when you get home (or in your car, if you're driving to a trail.) A huge part of distance running is smart fueling; this is an opportunity to work on that. She's not your mom; you can make your own sandwich & clean up after yourself.", "YTA. From the gf's perspective you have adopted a new hobby that is time consuming and she has had to structure time together around accommodating that schedule.  For some reason she is managing your nutrition plan. You have added to the laundry and she has accepted that burden.  You were unable to even go on a real date with her because of a time limit that you made up and refused to revise.  Then you came home filthy,  made a mess that you refused to clean up and asked her to make your lunch.\n\nI would be pissed, too.", "It's funny people have already said YTA and you still don't see that YTA... your taking advantage of her and after you have taken advantage of her you ask her to make YOU food... she's does ALOT for you and you don't have one day you can spend with her because of a goddamm marathon that isn't that important... you don't have your priorities straight and one day before that marathon your gona find her gone and no longer putting up with your shit... get your priorities straight... a marathon isn't more important than your gf", "YTA. Clean up after yourself. Feed yourself. It's not her job.", "YTA. Who walks into their house with wet and muddy shoes on and doesn\u2019t clean it up immediately? Why didn\u2019t you take off your damn shoes and socks before going inside? \nJust because you decided to do a halfy doesn\u2019t mean your girlfriend is required to do everything for you. If you aren\u2019t adult enough to be able to handle your own food and laundry as well as a hobby, stop the hobby.", "YTA. This is a charity run, not the Olympics. There's no valid reason why this should increase the amount of work she does *at all*. And to dump muddy, gross laundry on the floor and then ask her to make you food when she's already feeling used and neglected is just insane.", "YTA. Great that you\u2019re doing this for noble charitable  causes, but they\u2019re ones YOU\u2019RE passionate about. In the process, you\u2019ve roped her in. Over time, she\u2019s felt less and less appreciated, and more and more like a maid. \n\nIn pursuit of this, you\u2019ve offloaded food prep, laundry, cleaning and now on-demand meals into her.  In what other scenario is she supposed to do this allllll with a smile on her face when there\u2019s nothing in it for her?  \n\nEdit: Also, you\u2019re currently not doing anything for her in appreciation to lesson her domestic load. \n\nYou had the hangries. Own it, and apologize yo her for this otherwise you\u2019ll have less time to train as you\u2019ll be busy food prepping, cooking, cleaning and washing up after yourself.", "This is the most hilarious shit. It's a *half marathon*, my dude. It's a two-hour event. If you can't do your own laundry and feed yourself, don't sign up for something like this. And I say this as someone who regularly competes in events that are significantly longer, holds down a full time job, and feeds and looks after my family. The only time I've expected my partner to do those things for me was in the middle of a two-day, 280km event. Of course YTA. Go and apologise and do better.", "YTA. Your schedule sounds shite tbh . You partner is considerate of you, but there are limits. Talk to them.", "YTA. You\u2019re making it sound like you\u2019re training for an ultra marathon, not 13 miles. If you\u2019re so tired after a training session that you can\u2019t put your clothes away and make yourself some food, maybe you shouldn\u2019t be doing this. By the way, my niece is married, mother of 4 children 10 and under, trained for a full marathon and was still able to do everything that was needed around the house and work.", "Yes, you're kind of pretty selfish and TA, why do you ask?", "YTA. Why is she cleaning up after you while you get to do your thing? You are 26 my man. Training is a hobby that she decided to support you in and you take advantage. Clean up after yourself and make your own food. Being tired after work is one thing, but you trained for a hobby, NOT the olympics so I\u2019m SURE you can spare 5 mins to pick up laundry and cook something.", "YTA, and the problem did not start last night. \n\nThrow your clothes directly in the washer next time, and make yourself something to eat. Take a shower before trying to cuddle with her. Then make a grocery list and go shopping. Buy some things she likes that you don't like.", "So, I don\u2019t think she was upset about you asking to make her food. It seems like she wants to spend time with you and you\u2019re super focused on training.  You need to talk to her and figure out a plan where she gets the time she needs with you and you still get to train. But YTA for leaving wet clothes on the floor, tracking mud in the kitchen and not talking with girlfriend at figure out how you can both have you needs met.", "YTA and if you don\u2019t stop being selfish and ignoring your girlfriends needs she will hopefully find someone who treats her well.", "YTA- You make it sound like the fact that your half marathon you plan to do is some massively noble cause since some of the money from it goes to cancer research. Now all of a sudden when your (extremely supportive) gf, who has been doing tons of extra stuff to help out wants some of your time you show her that she is second priority to you, then proceed to come home, make a goatfuck out of the house and ask her to cook for you. \n\nGet over yourself soon. \nHere is the reality, your gf is a real person. \nYour hobby is exactly that, a hobby.\nFix your priorities or you will be blessed with plenty of time to endlessly pursue your hobby because she is gonna jet since she deserves better.", "YTA\n\nAdding insult to injury puts you squarely in the asshole category.", "Yta it takes as much effort to throw muddy clothes directly in the washer or a hamper as it does to thrown them on the floor.  \n\nYou then ask the *already visibly annoyed* person to make you food?  Read the room dude.", "In the god damn corner?!  \n\nMuddy clothing goes into the washing machine. \nThen you get clean so you can enjoy your food and the company of the person supporting you. \n\nJust cos you are doing a charity run doesn\u2019t stop you from being a massive AH\n\nYour choice to train should increase your own workload, anyone willing to support you is a bonus and you don\u2019t shit on that. \n\nYou are shitting on it. \n\nRaging, haemorrhoid-bedazzled AH.", "YTA. You tracked mud into the clean house, you threw dirty laundry in the corner then asked her to fix you something to eat instead of fixing it for yourself.", "INFO: when did YOU last cook for her, on a time ofc\u00e4 HER choosing?", "YTA. I have run 11 marathons and dozens of half marathons and have never acted so obnoxiously. You're supposed to pack energy gels and bars so you aren't \"starving\" at the end of your run. Training runs aren't even that long for a half! You should not be burdening your girlfriend. Sounds like you're milking it a bit, TBH.", "YTA\n\nShe\u2019s being supportive, and you\u2019re taking advantage. The little things like putting your clothes in the laundry basket and wiping your feet go along way.", "YTA. You want to run a marathon. She isn\u2019t forcing you. So all of the extra work should be yours. She already takes quite a lot of the extra work without getting any appreciation. On the contrary, you complain if she doesn\u2019t want to make you food or hug you when you are sweaty and gross.", "YTA!! Cook your own food!! Training is important but your not a child so stop acting like she owes you something!", "Yes, YTA. Just go back and read your post. If you don\u2019t see the selfishness and disrespect littered throughout it, nothing anyone says here can help you.", "Oh it\u2019s you again. \n\nYTA. \n\nThis is your second time here because of your marathon. You can stop telling everyone you are training for a half marathon now. It doesn\u2019t have to be your whole personality especially since it\u2019s making you be a jerk to your GF all day everyday.", "YTA", "YTA and while raising money for a good cause is great you can still contribute more. My husband did a fundraiser like this for many years and it took so much time. He quit doing the event recently but gives more than ever to the cause. Raising funds for charity is great but this is mainly for you. You can plan better.", "YTA.", "I have no less than two friends who regularly run marathons and manage to do so creating very little extra work for their partners.

Instead you think your girlfriend is some servant to do the work of cooking for you.", "Are you really this daft? \n\nYTA. \n\nAnd if you can\u2019t see that then please leave this poor girl alone to find a man with more emotional intelligence.", "No", "Kinda yeah but the laundry and even the food isnt (edit: the main reason) why shes upset. I think she's upset that she doesnt get to spend too much quality time with you. I think sitting down and having an open conversation (after you do your OWN laundry and make your OWN dinner, dont make an angry person do that please) can help to ensure every feel heard.", "This is relationship drama and we don\u2019t know. Your girlfriend certainly feels unappreciative. We don\u2019t know how much you\u2019ve done to make her feel appreciated.", "You were kindof a jerk. She was irritated at you, and you chose that moment to ask her to do something for you. My guess is this issue is about more than a pile of clothes and a little mud. \n\nShe needs some attention and care. It sounds like she's tired, burned out, and feeling neglected.", "NAH.  How is anyone supposed to judge this?  It\u2019s a minor bit of strife in a relationship none of us know anything about.   You irritated her.  She expressed this.

I\u2019d be annoyed too, how annoyed depends on how often things like this happen. \n\nMaybe GF overreacted to that, which tells me it probably ain\u2019t the first time she\u2019s been annoyed at picking up or cleaning up or training being more important than doing things together.  You need to talk it out or you may find you two are not very compatible actually.", "YTA. Make yourself a bowl of cereal or some toast. I\u2019ve run marathons and half marathons. The impact my half marathon training had on my partner was minimal. She\u2019s being supportive but it\u2019s not her job to be your mommy.", "No", "YTA.\n\n- threw dirty clothes into a pile in the hall\n- tracked mud inside\n- told her to make you food\n- are not spending time with her when she asks\n\nWhat is she getting out of all this? It's fine to have a hobby but it seems yours is at her expense. Right now, sounds like you treat her like your mom.", "YTA. You seem to be taking yourself a bit too seriously and expecting your GF to do the same. \"Feeling annoyed and antagonized...\"- sheesh, sounding sort of full of yourself. I hope you apologize and take your ego down a notch.", "YTA you can put your clothes in the proper place, take your own shower and then make your own food. What is she your mom? Why does she need to do those things for you? What have you down for her lately ?", "yta. you\u2019re running a race for fun not curing the actual cancer, get a grip and take care of your own needs", "Lmao\u2026.. yes. I\u2019d be absolutely shocked if anyone states otherwise", "It\u2019s sweet that she wanted to spend time with you, despite this challenging schedule. You are being pretty dismissive of her, at some point your race will be over, but hopefully you\u2019ll still be in this relationship. You should be nicer and thank her for helping you on this journey\u2026YTA", "YTA. Make your own food and do your own laundry. Your girlfriend is not your maid.", "You picked up a new hobby. It creates extra labor.  Your partner has picked up most of that labor.  You've started prioritizing your hobby over time with her.  She's been supportive, but has given you clear signs that she feels detached and used.  \n\nYou continue to prioritize the hobby and carry on like everything is fine.  On the day that broke the camel's back, you failed to do even the bare minimum of the labor - feeding and picking up after yourself - AND created additional labor - mud on the floor.  And expected her not to be upset when you tried to handwave it off as NBD before then attempting to offload yet another task onto her?\n\nPerhaps you should look into charities that are working to cure weaponized incompetence instead of cancer.  YTA 100% - go apologize, and REALLY mean it.  After you clean up after yourself.", "YTA\n\nWhen I get back from exercise, I put my clothes in the basket and take a bath. Shoes go off at the door, whether they're muddy or not. Then, after I've cleaned up, I fix something to eat. You should do the same. Besides having respect for your girlfriend, you should have enough respect for yourself not to want to trollop through the house with mud and get grime everywhere.\n\nAs for the food part, this is where lack of planning on your part should not equate to emergency on her part. I have a key-table at my door. Before I exercise, and just in general, I keep bottled water and snacks (meat sticks, granola bars, little bags of chips, Viennas, etc) on the table so that if I'm in a bad spot when I get home, I have at least something at hand.  Same with the hot meal part. There's no excuse not to have at least some kind of TV dinner or frozen pizza or something that either you could cook quickly after you showered or you could ask her to just pop in and press a button. You hadn't gone grocery shopping yet? Again, that just sounds like a general lack of planning in life in general, regardless of whether you're training or not. \n\nUnless you're dirt poor, you shouldn't be living hand-to-mouth and reach a point where you have nothing in your fridge. It never hurts to buy a few extra frozen dinners, cans of soup, etc. - especially when there are so many options now for just about any diet/food plan (GF, organic, low sodium, low fat, Kosher, halal, vegetarian, etc). This isn't 30 years ago when your choices were Banquet Turkey or Banquet Meatloaf. Even if you don't eat these kinds of these regularly, you should always have at least some for situations just like this. And, in the event that you are dirt poor, just buy some packs of ramen or Banquet TV dinners, even if you only eat them in emergencies. Eating something unhealthy on a rare bad night isn't going to ruin your training or put you back at square one.", "WTF - YTA.\n\nGet a life", "YTA. While you were having a bad time, you asking her yo make you food is in bad form. Things like this are offered and not requested.", "YTA, you're a big boy, you can make your own food and clean up after yourself.", "YTA\n\n\nYou acted very ungrateful and like a very poor planner. .\n\n\nWhy didn't you thought about what to eat that day before you went running? I mean, that you would be hungry was really no surprise.", "YTA. You are able to take care of yourself right?", "YTA - I guess the only thing to do now is starve /s.\n\n\nMake your own food once in a while and start valuing your girlfriends work/contribute more.", "You nor she is the asshole. This seems petty AF to me. \n  You presented your side of the situation. Taking everything at face value, from your perspective, I see it like this. Do your own laundry, cook your own food. Call Waitr, DoorDash, whatever. \n   You might be the most well intentioned man on the planet earth, but your excessive mansplaing in the buildup just doesn\u2019t make your actions right. And again, it think it\u2019s petty as fuck. I\u2019m just a guy. I want to hear what the ladies want to say", "YTA you are taking advantage of her. You get mud all over the floor and throw your wet clothes everywhere. And then have the audacity to ask her to make you food especially after all you have done for months is watch a movie or two . Stop treating her like she is your slave or assistant. You knew this was a hobby that required a lot of work to maintain, and whilst you get to do the fun things of your hobby like running, you have left everything else for your girlfriend to do.", "You're a fool to think this sub will vote you NTA. You're a dude, this sub almost always votes dudes as the a h, wnen they vote a woman n t a for the identical behaviors. Reverse the genders and try your story again in 6 months to see if I'm right.", "She\u2019s your gf not your maid. Grow up YTA", "I don't get what the all the extra work is from though. It's nice that GF is trying to be helpful, but it really shouldn't be necessary to have that much extra laundry done or to cook some kind of special extra meals. OP sounds like he's just taking advantage.\n\nIt's a half-marathon for charity. He's not Michael Phelps training for the Olympics.\n\nAgree on your point about quality time with GF, would probably be best to have a shared calendar so she knows which mornings are training run mornings and they can plan quality time around those. His long runs are probably 2 hours max, add prep and post cleanup, maybe 3 hours of time total. Should leave plenty of extra time for quality time.", "Same. I was thinking the same thing. My husband has more laundry, yes, but just because of running in general. And even when he\u2019s running 100milers he\u2019s not expecting me to wait on him and make him meals. You\u2019re running 13 miles my guy. It\u2019s not that big of a deal. Good for you, but not her problem.", "I know, this all seems very dramatic for a 21km race.", "Yeah lol, last year my husband and I both started running and did 3 half-marathons...our whole house was just a mess and we ate take-out all the time since there was no-one to do our laundry or cook.... Oh wait, no, we just did our chores like normal people.", "For a charity marathon too... like aren't a lot of those like... not competitive? XD", "This exactly. I can't fathom picking up any hobby and expecting my partner to carry all the responsibilities while I have all the fun. Imagine if OP's gf got super into painting, and she expected him to wash her paint brushes, clean spilled paint off their shared furniture, and keep her paints stocked. Even though he doesn't participate in the activity or benefit from it. And then imagine she blew off spending time with him to pursue this hobby, and still expected him to facilitate it.", "GROSS", "He can make himself a bowl of cereal or some toast, and clean up his own mess.", "He can make himself some toast or cereal. OP should grow up.", "Poor buddyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!", "Wow wait until you find out how tired normal people are and they still cool their own food. My God. She's your girlfriend not your mommy", "So eat a protein bar. Why are you so badly prepared for your runs?", "Oh no, you were famished!!!1!!1! \n\nWhat a baby, grow up.", "Lol you are treating this as an Olympic game, dude is just a fucking stupid run no one cares about.", "I bet this half marathon is the first athletic thing you\u2019ve ever done. If it weren\u2019t, you wouldn\u2019t be making such a big deal out of training for it. And with that being said, you treating your girlfriend like a maid over it is very sad. How little does she mean to you that you\u2019re willing to so all this to her over a 13-mile charity run? Jesus.", "NO ONE wants to be hugged by a sweaty mess of a person. That's fucking disgusting.", "She doesn\u2019t want to be hugged when you are a) sweaty and wet b) she is angry with you.", ">OP should ask Her if he's the AH\n\nOP have already known the answer before posting here.", "Do you mean, they wouldn't have as many pairs of work out clothes so they have to do laundry more often to have clean stuff? Or that previously they didn't get their clothes as sweaty?\n\nBecause, it's not like you are switching shirts or shorts halfway through a run. You should only be using one shirt and one pair of shorts per training day. That shouldn't be that big of increase in laundry.\n\nEither way OP is ridiculous. I get the desire to have an early night if you want to get up and go for a long run in the morning, but training for a half marathon isn't the kind of event that requires some sort of personal chef to \"support\" you with meals or a maid to do extra laundry. \n\nNor are you going to be so drop dead exhausted and starving that you need to tear off your clothing spraying mud everywhere as you rush to the kitchen like some kind of husky puppy. \n\nLike JFC OP, pack a granola bar like the rest of us and leave a towel by the door.", "1. Not relevant \n2. Not relevant", "So if I pay for the first date as a woman,  the man should do my laundry and cook for me while I have no time for him and I ignore his needs? hmm... I say this comment is irrelevant.", "Then do that every day for months.", "He said he'd clean it up. Sure but he's starving and soaking in mud so he can't do both and there's a second person there who could assist her BF if she wasn't being a brat", "So could the GF. She's a brat", "The first mid-summer (i.e., sweaty) walk I did after I broke my spine, I had to have someone come with me because no one was sure how far I could make it.

He\u2019s gonna be the big man and fix cancer with the power of his running! His little woman should just play nice and do everything for him so he can continue to be a hero and make this his entire world and personality! Cannot believe how selfish she is to want her *partner* to not make her life harder while he\u2019s being such a big strong man. She should be grateful that he gave her the reward of cleaning up after him and making him food for his hungry lil tummy! So he can fix cancer with his important running!! /s", "Op's username tho.", "Oh yeah I totally agree. It\u2019s ridiculous. The intensity makes it sound like they were someone who absolutely never exercised before. Why else would you have to train so much for a half marathon? So my guess is that they just simply didn\u2019t have the extra clothes before.", "Everyday for life.", "That is unbelievably condescending. Calling grown women \"brats\" is infantilizing and misogynistic. God forbid we don't put up with less than we want and deserve and choose to end one sided, unfulfilling relationships with selfish men.", "It\u2019s not her job to clean up after him and feed him like he\u2019s a helpless child.", "It\u2019s not her job to make a grown man cereal. She\u2019s his gf not his mommy.", "She's not in a mood to hear childish excuses but I'd bet good money she's ready to hear a sincere apology or walk into a clean, non muddied up kitchen and laundry", "Even better.", "It's not his job to stay up and keep her company all night when he has plans early in the morning.\n\nHe was gonna clean up. He was busy in the shower so he asked her to make food because he's busy and it will be done faster so he doesn't have hunger pains any longer than needed, but yeah let your BF suffer in pain because he didn't cuddle as long as you wanted. Brat", "What do you think a GF is?", "What\u2019s not fair is the level of  incompetence OP operates at his big age of 26", "He doesn't say anything about her giving him the cold shoulder, just that she was annoyed about him tracking in mud and throwing his laundry on the floor. I don't know why you've fixated so much on the bedtime  - even if you remove that situation it's annoying. If I was taking on extra work to help someone with their hobby, and they made a mess and then asked me to do more work, I'd be annoyed too.", "He didn\u2019t stay up *or* miss his run. What post did you read?? It sounds like you\u2019re letting your own previous experiences cloud your judgement.\n\nThere was no reason they needed to save time.

If she wasn't annoyed already she would be like Okay that's reasonable\n\nShe was upset about not spending all night with him so she's not giving him her free time. She's a brat, helping him with his hobby isn't some sainthood charitable deed, it's supporting your BD or GF. I'm sure he does for her hobbies too", "I didn't say he did. The fact he didn't is why she's mad. She wanted him to stay up late and if he stayed up he wouldn't be rested for his training\n\nHe was starving and covered in mud and rain, so either he has hunger pains for longer or he makes a big mess. Or the brat sucks it up a acts like a big girl and offers to help make food because why is that such an ask?\n\nHe said he was gonna clean it up. Sure he could do it but it's nice she helps, it's what supportive partner would do", "I think he wanted more than that", "What do you think goes on in an adult relationship?", "She\u2019s been cooking for and cleaning up after him for months. \n\nHe then comes in to their clean house, makes a giant mess & then asks her to cook for him on top of it. There was no reason for him to ask her to cook for him.

Giving the cold shoulder instead of just talking it out is kinda immature in a way, but I definitely get where she comes from. \n\nLike, they have both been busy, and she just wanted some time with him, and shes okay to feel a bit upset about it. He didn't bother to not make a mess and that might frustrate her, even if he said he would clean it, why make the mess in the first place? And after making a mess, he asked her to cook, he could simply just throw something together and then shower or do it after a nice shower.\n\nShe definitely has a right to feel the way she does, but definitely acted immature. \n\nI think they just need to communicate.", "Why can\u2019t he meal prep for himself, not track mud into the house, and clean his own dirty clothes if he\u2019s the one taking up the hobby?", "Pulling away from a hug from someone who was just out running and is sweaty and muddy is not a cold shoulder move, it's not wanting to get sweaty and muddy lol", "You are so dramatic. He is not STARVED.

She isn't communicating she is locking herself in the bedroom", "So that's justification for his GF being a brat and not talking to him? \n\nThey had no food to prep, and you can't not track mud in if you're outside in mud. He said he would clean it, it's not an issue", "His own words was that he was starved.\n\nYou're ignoring details. He cant clean himself and cook at the same time. If he cooks before he washes he's making more of a mess.
