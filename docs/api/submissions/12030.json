My fianc\u00e9 (of 4 yrs) was told he cannot come and only family is allowed, which is weird because he comes to everything. I was upset, but still decided to go. The day comes and only my mom and I go to her baby shower. My aunt asks where my father and brother are. I told her that they went out of town together. She then says \u201cI\u2019m glad your brother and dad didn\u2019t come because I didn\u2019t want them in the pictures or videos.\u201d I was confused but ignored it and continue talking to my family members. Then out of nowhere I hear \u201cyeah, OP\u2019s brother is adopted and is a *racial slur*.\u201d I turn my head around I saw it was my aunt that said this. I walk up to her and this random girl she\u2019s talking to. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t call my brother a racial slur. And what does the color of my brothers skin have to do with ANYTHING anyways?!\u201d I scream. She proceeds to say \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t photograph well because he is dark. I was explaining to my friend that\u2019s why I\u2019m glad he won\u2019t be in the pictures.\u201d That\u2019s when it hit me. She didn\u2019t want my fianc\u00e9 coming because HE is black too. I looked at her and said, \u201cEveryone here is miserable and nobody likes being around you, they all think you are a b****. No wonder your husband left you, racist a** c***!\u201d I\u2019m non-confrontational usually and I was shaking the whole time I was saying this. Everyone stopped what they were doing and just stared. That\u2019s when she started crying. All I could think was \u201coh crap. I just made a pregnant lady cry\u201d. Then she stands up and begins to yell \u201cLEAVE RIGHT NOW, YOU (racial slur) LOVER. NONE OF THE FAMILY LIKES YOUR BLACK BOYFRIEND OR BROTHER ANYWAYS.\u201d I looked at her astonished. My mom comes out of the crowd and grabs my hand to pull me away from this mess. My aunt points at my mother and says, \u201cYou know it\u2019s your fault she acts like this since you raised her alongside a (racial slur).\u201d Now before I continue, I need to explain that my moms the sweetest lady ever. Shes 95 pounds and does not have ill feelings towards anyone, except for racist people and those who disrespect her kids. She walks up close to my aunt, who is almost a foot taller than her, and tells her, in harsh terms, to back off. Then me and my mom walk alway. When we get in the car she hugs me and apologizes saying I\u2019ll never have to see my aunt again. When I get home, I have tons of text from my other aunts, cousins, and grandparents. Apparently, after we left, she made everyone leave. Most of the messages called me an a**hole for ruining her special day. They\u2019re all threatening to cut contact with me if I don\u2019t apologize to my aunt and pay a portion of the venue since it was our fault the shower ended. I spoke to two of my friends about this and they said I\u2019m the a**hole since it was her day and she can invite who she wants.

Well done you and your mum and live a happy life away from their evilness. NTA obviously", "Bless her heart. NTA", "NTA. Yeah it's her day and she can invite whoever she wants.

Tell everyone calling you the AH that racists don't get to have a special day. They deserve judgment constantly and should not be supported in anyway. If they are so supportive of her then they are enabling a racist and agreeing with her behavior with their actions so by default they are also being racist. Expose these people please.

You never know what they could say when you step out of a room.", "So people are only reading half a fucking post now? I did say OP wasn't the AH for taking the stand that she did but I basically meant that her approach was thoroughly classless.", "No. But maybe she was one of those ones who kept silent about it because she knows it\u2019s not accepted, but now that she\u2019s pregnant, she felt safer letting it all out.", "Ah yes. Racists, the folks most known for their grace, poise, and class. Why even bother with it. Also ding dong, I wasn\u2019t even arguing with you I was just responding. Take it less personal.", "That it only came out at her whites only baby shower sounds like she\u2019s one of those racists who thinks everyone has the same opinion, a silent majority, that\u2019s why they freak out when they\u2019re confronted with cognitive dissonance challenging that belief", "Actually, I take it back I was arguing. I\u2019m sick of this \u201cmeet them at the high road bullshit\u201d fuck class man, those kinds don\u2019t respond to class. I believe most racists would honestly be better dead so maybe she got off easy here. And let\u2019s be real, someone tells you they hate your siblings and partner you\u2019re gonna go \u201coh please don\u2019t say that \ud83e\udd7a\u201d NO! You should and would tell them to fuck right off ! and you would be in the right for that!"]}
