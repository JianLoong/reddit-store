That\u2019s what after work is for\u2026", "I don't know, my HR department would not tolerate someone was trying to pressure a coworker for money.\n\nEdit:  My mistake, not CO worker, a manager.  That's even worse.", "I disagree, obviously.", "My company ended ours for exactly this reason.  The lady in charge of it sent an email out stating that someone wasn't contributing, which wasn't fair.  She didn't name the person but was trying to shame the person into contributing.  We all received an email later that day stating the birthday club was being ended due to conflicts.", "My last company had it set up so all contributions had to be anonymous. There was an old comments box that was locked and we had to use that. The admin had a key to open it with the manager responsible and it was take out and out directly in the card before being handed directly to the employee. We were not allowed to host \u201cparties\u201d for an individual unless it was a retirement. It seemed a bit overkill, but it all happened because of issues in the past.", "I love my passive aggressive little monsters. They\u2019re the only creatures who can bathe *at* you to really express their disappointment in your life choices.", "Sorry but that made me chuckle", "\"I can see the bottom of the bowl between the kibbles, human!\"  Glares whilst licking their privates angrily.", "You summed up my grey tabby perfectly, I SWEAR he knows that the sound of him grooming himself drives me bonkers.  And he's the one who has 30min baths, unlike my other two.  I ask him if he's done and he'll just gives me a half-lidded look.", "NTA I'm the person who has organized everyone else's birthdays and special occasions in the office and I think all I've gotten is a cupcake.", "Everyone in your office secretly admires your gull. Either that or they are a child who gives a fuck about this non-sense. Your boss needs to grow up.", "Just immediately NTA. \n\nHappy belated birthday OP.", "NTA. I\u2019ve worked at places before where the birthday expectations are ridiculous, over the top, and frankly exhausting. Someone braver and equally fed up pointed this out at a staff meeting and ever since there\u2019s been one committee who buys a sheet cake once a month to celebrate the birthdays of the month and everyone is much happier for it. You\u2019re within your rights to exclude yourself from this nonsense especially when it wasn\u2019t reciprocated", "NTA I agree with whoever said talk to HR or even find a new job. I would so hurt if I didn\u2019t get a birthday card like everyone else did and I probably would have done the same thing", "In my office we all contribute $5 a month and we celebrate everyone\u2019s birthday for that month. Cake marking goodies. If someone has a death in the family we will send flowers from that fund also. It\u2019s call the Sunshine fund", "NTA. My work has done bday and congratulations gifts for others before. I always chipped in and even did drives for people. Once, when nobody but me and another coworker donated I was the one stuck with the bill. When the next email came around asking for money, I replied NO. And explained why. Unfortunately, I ended up getting stuck with another payment for the boss because her cat died and I wanted to get her something nice. Sometimes I want to be Creulla Deville on my coworkers, sometimes they need it", "NTA and straight to HR. \n\nShe tried to emotionally blackmail you. It might sound harsh but it Is what she did.", "NTA\nI don't blame you. I wonder if collecting like this is acceptable to HR. At rate I would ask maybe tell HR you felt harassed. Good luck and Happy birthday.", "NTA. Work for a company that the time clock says so and so at home office wishes you a happy birthday. Far as I'm concerned that's on my employment application and that's where it stays. No one needs to know. Not work related.", "NTA HR is never your friend.", "NTA. And honestly I\u2019d call HR. There should be absolutely no soliciting at work. That\u2019s harassment. I once had a female manager ask me and another girl to be the \u201coffice party coordinators\u201d to hassle ppl exactly like you were (but this was 2007). Me and the other woman asked, we both have birthdays in mid-December\u2026so I mentioned No birthdays for me or my friend (which is understandable, there was always a thnxgvg, and a winter pot luck/party)- that\u2019s fine, but keep outta my/our pocket the other 11 months out of the year then too. Because, you\u2019re right- give as good as you get.", "NTA", "NTA give the same energy that they\u2019re giving you. Honestly I would report her to HR for her behavior trying to bully you into giving someone money. And basically making it a whole scene.", "NTA", "NTA. These are colleagues and not your friends. Their opinion means nothing. Be awesome at your work and all this extra nonsense will take a backseat.", "NTA. I used to coordinate the birthday collections for my team before we started working from home, and it was always made known that contributions were 100% voluntary. It's completely unprofessional for your boss to \"shame\" you for not contributing. \nI also don't think you were wrong for bringing up that for your birthday, you got nothing. Before your birthday, it sounds like you always contributed something, so to do that for others and get nothing when it's supposed to be your turn, I don't blame you for not wanting to participate any longer.", "NTA\n\nI started working retail last August, everyone started at this new shop in August or later. We have never done cards, or collections for birthdays or leavers. They did one this week, not impressed.", "She didn\u2019t even apologize. She just rolled her eyes. He is clearly the most hated person in the office based on her behavior.", "It wouldn't have occurred to a good manager to shout across the work area trying to coerce/shame anyone to begin with.", "Happy cake day!\n\nalso, agree 100%\nReport to HR! \nNTA", "Happy cake day!", "That's my thought as well. I wonder if HR knows they are doing this anyway.", "Happy Cake Day! \ud83c\udf82", "They shouldn\u2019t be wasting company time with this nonsense at all.", "I have a feeling OP would thrive in remote work. My partner certainly did. He\u2019s making more money than ever because he isn\u2019t losing work as a result of personal issues very similar to OP. Being treated like a second class citizen and singled out because he doesn\u2019t want to participate in non work related activities. Almost to the point of being a disability. \n\nHe is a brilliant engineer but a total dummy when it comes to socializing.", "\ud83e\uddb5 <", "Oh so true. That last sentence. \n\nThat is how it goes.", "I hope OP really said that stuff. I was sure they were gonna wimp out because I would probably have wimped out. I wouldn\u2019t have paid but also not a express why.", "You sure HR isn't gonna be asking why the manager is harassing an employee for money? Because my HR definitely would.", "This is like an episode of The Office. I want updates. \n\nOP should put someone\u2019s stapler in jello.", "HR absolutely should have a problem with people being pressured to contribute to something that should be voluntary. ESPECIALLY since OP was left out entirely on their own birthday. Sounds like the celebrations need to be shut down if they\u2019re not being handled equitably.", "well is it just annoying if EVERYONE else gets a card and you get singled out with nothing?  \nAnd then to badger him at all, let alone in front of others, loudly and repeatedly, because he's not willing to contribute his own personal money is an issue in and of itself. noone is obliged to contribute to anything like this.  \n\n\nI would go to HR OP. You are being bullied.   \n\n\nNTA", "Companies should not want unprofessional, non-sence happening during work hours.", "It's a major problem when a member of management does it vs a peer.", "Most likely, but some feel it fosters a connection among the workforce. But it should be all or nothing. That is how it was done in places I worked.", "Or put the signed card in jello", "Exactly that. A manager did it.", "Totally agree... and it's not just birthdays, don't forget the baby showers, weddings, someone's kid selling girl scout cookies...\n\nSolicitation of money from employees for any reason has no place in the work place.", "I think the connection it fosters end up being toxic and shallow much like OP\u2019s situation. I think it\u2019s misguided and just bad habits from people who want to screw around at work. \n\nOn the surface people are smiling(they are required to)but really it\u2019s just building resentment and social tension. \n\nI think there are better ways to team build. Not to mention, this is often damaging to Neurodivergent employees. \n\nMy partner has been making more money than ever since he started working remote. He is a brilliant engineer but was losing work and jobs because of non-work related social issues, VERY similar to OP\u2019s issues.", "I wonder if anyone else has been left out. Maybe they should unionize against the popular kids.", "[Alice, please!](https://youtu.be/WLyQq_-WbXQ)", "*licking intensifies*", "Mine has started doing that while SITTING in the kibble bowl."]}
