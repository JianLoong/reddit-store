Oh okay\u201d - I have no idea why she shouted that across the office for everybody to hear almost like she was trying to publicly shame me for being the only person in the office to not contribute, anyway the next day again her manager this time came up to me at my desk and said that Hannah\u2019s collection had now closed on email so If I want I\u2019ll have to make a contribution in cash, she said this in her normal voice to which i responded in my normal voice \u201cI\u2019m alright I don\u2019t want to make any contributions right now\u201d suddenly her voice volume increases by like 4X and she sounded really shocked and said \u201cwhat so you won\u2019t be making a contribution to Hannah\u2019s birthday collection then? Everybody else has\u201d she done this in a shocked and louder voice to try and shake me again, I seen almost everybody\u2019s eyes lift up above their screens and look over and I felt really embarrassed so I too increased my voice so the rest could hear and I said \u201cwell it wasn\u2019t a problem last month for nobody to even sign a card or set up a collection for me was it so why is it a problem when I decide not to contribute to anybody else\u2019s anymore\u201d , she rolled her eyes at me and walked away and now I feel like I made a rude comment and feel like everybody\u2019s talking about what I said and how I said it behind my back and it\u2019s making me feel sick tbh", "created_utc": 1676745823, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/115m48s/aita_for_sticking_up_for_myself_against_being/", "score": 275, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s your money, you determine what to do with it. If you don\u2019t want to contribute anymore because you don\u2019t feel valued there I don\u2019t see anything wrong with it. I\u2019m glad you clapped back at her. She was being completely inappropriate by loudly calling you out and frankly I\u2019d report her to HR for creating an uncomfortable work environment.", "NTA, your boss is a d*ck. Contributions to birthday funds should be completely voluntary and anonymous.\n\nYou even pointed out to her that *no one* set up a birthday fund for you, which is what I was going to suggest you do. She didn\u2019t get her knickers in a twist and demand contributions when you birthday pot didn\u2019t go around. Which strongly indicates (sorry OP) that she doesn\u2019t like you for some reason. She sucks.\n\nStick to your guns and don\u2019t be bullied by her. Maybe look at other opportunities in the same company that you could move to and not be managed by her any more.", "NTA. These office politics are getting way out of hand. It\u2019s not required to contribute to a birthday fund, ESPECIALLY if no one was bothered to do the same for you. While generally, it\u2019s not expected that you\u2019d receive just because you gave, it\u2019s certainly asshole behavior for your coworker and manager to publicly drag you for choosing not to give. You did the right thing by speaking up for yourself. And that\u2019s probably why your manager just walked away instead of escalating the situation.", "NTA.  Birthday collections are either universal or they are just another iteration of office politics. The people in your office who didn't bother to notice your birthday shouldn't try to shame you now you choose not to participate.", "NTA.  It sounds like that manager rolled her eyes because she had her mind already made up that you were in the wrong. But you shut that shit down by explaining exactly why you didn't feel like participating.  There was nothing that she could have actually said in the moment that wouldn't have made her look like an absolute ass.  \n\nA good manager would have apologized to you and followed up by looking into why your recent birthday had been neglected.  A better manager would have stayed out of it altogether in the first place.", "No you weren't wrong. Who organizes the collections? There needs to be a formal process to insure no one is left out. NTA.", "NTA. And these semi-coercive requirements to contribute to personal gifts for co-workers are total BS.", "NTA. What they are doing is extortion. Report to HR.", "NTA and enough with that noise, this sort of office bullying is ridiculous.  No one needs a birthday present from their work, but leaving you out is shitty and they are shitty.  Also the correct response would be to apologize to you for leaving you out, not pretending it didn't matter.", "NTA - Sorry you are stuck in a god-forsaken office space.  Companies with half a clue ban this sort of stuff so there isn't this obnoxious chip-in, buy-my-kids-fundraiser, office-tax culture established.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t know how it is in the UK but the last large company I worked for they would cover the cost of a sheet cake for your area once a month for all birthdays.  No cards - no gifts - no money.  Come get a slice of cake if you want one. \n\nMore than one US company has been sued for someone forcing people to participate as -surprise to no one - at least one religion does not celebrate birthdays and a number of people who chose not to participate were being bullied. \n\nI don\u2019t know if HR can do anything for you in the UK.  But I would say that it is likely other folks in your area who don\u2019t want to participate but don\u2019t have the stones to say no. Maybe the next time around they will. And even if they don\u2019t just stick to your decision not to participate anymore.  \n\nA suggestion to have your phone set to record (check laws to be sure not illegal) the next birthday where you don\u2019t contribute so you can capture the feedback from the charming woman who likes to broadcast her opinion each time.", "NTA This is why I am strongly against celebrating birthdays at the workplace. Someone is going to get forgotten and feelings will get hurt.", "NTA. Go to HR. That\u2019s disgusting behaviour on her part and you need to nip it in the bud immediately.", "NTA, but very close to an E S H. I get you being upset that they left you out. But rather than take it out passive aggressively, you could have just directly told the office you won\u2019t be participating in the future. Waiting until someone else\u2019s birthday makes it feel petty. It\u2019s like you\u2019re taking your blame out on that person.
