Since then I saw him maybe 3-4 times at family functions. From my family, I found out he got married and had other kids. I figured he wouldn't have been a good dad just because of the type of dad he's been to me my whole life. \n\n\nYesterday was my great grandma\u2019s 100th birthday so we were doing a big party for her. A few days ago I found out from my grandma my dad is going to be there and more than likely with his kids. I was still going to go though because I've always been close to my great-grandma. \n\nAbout an hour of me being at this party my dad, his wife, and their 2 kids walk in. The kids were about 3 and 6 years old. I watched them off and on through the party... My dad was actually being a dad, he was playing with his kids and listening to them, even had cute nicknames for them. \n\nThen my dad came up to me and said pretty much \u201cUh... Hey (my name)... Um how have you... Been... It's..um been a while\u201d. I will admit I was upset seeing my dad act like the person he never was to me and has never put in the effort. So I said I'm okay I then pointed over to his kids and said congrats on actually being a dad this time around. My dad got mad and said he's sorry but he can't change the past... But he never even puts up an effort now to call or text me or wants to come to visit me. I then had other family members tell me I need to grow up and get over it and now be happy for my dad.

He never did anything to fix that past. He COULD. He DIDN'T. And now he dare being angry at you? The audacity of that man! That's so easy for other family members to judge you. You're only 17 and just find out he could be a good dad with others kids. They are the real assholes here. If someone should grow up, that's them. The problem is not that you should \"grow up\". The problem is your dad being an asshole, hurting you and them thinking everything's OK. But it's not OK. That man could try talk to you way before that party. He could try have some time for you. He never did. \n\nAnd no, you're not an asshole. Not at all. You had a perfectly understandable reaction in this situation.", "NTA.

They're fools for siding with him. \n\n\nWhen you made your wisecrack \"Dad\" should have owned up to his mistakes and apologized right there.

And sending virtual hugs to you. It must be a lot of pain and confusing as a child.", "NTA", "Grow up? You\u2019re 17. Still a child. Your dad has it in his power to admit to his mistakes, beg forgiveness and try to make the future better. Instead he and his flying monkeys want you to pretend as if his misdeeds never happened. Forget that noise. You have every right to feel as you do and your dad is the a-hole.", "NTA, not even remotely. How can you \u201cforget about the past\u201d when he\u2019s actively still making that decision *in the present*? You don\u2019t deserve a father of that caliber.", "NTA- Not even a little.  For people telling you to get over it, ask them if they'll pay for the therapy bill.  You're 17. You're still a child and you still need a father.  It would have been nice to have when I'm sure.  I can only imagine.  I know what times when I see other people with their happy fathers it hurts.

Leaving the past behind. That is always a lame excuse. His responsibilities are the same to his current kids. He didn't fulfill them.

Hell I would be frustrated with anyone who is clearly more than capable of carrying conversation and then coming up to me and being more anxious and awkward than a coked up chihuahua, let alone someone who abandoned me.

Btw he failed to pay child support due him. Then you can get over him. Good luck and have a great life", "NTA. He's right, he can't change the past. He'll always have been a deadbeat absentee father. Marrying again and having more kids that he treats well makes it worse, not better. \n\nFrom someone who's 34 and went through all this drama a decade ago.

It sounds like maybe he's realizing how much he hurt you and how terrible his previous actions were and is feeling guilty. But if he wants to try to make up for it he needs to start with a real apology. An apology that acknowledges how much he hurt you and leaves room for your feelings. \"I said sorry now get over it\" is a terrible apology for anything but nowhere near enough for abandoning a kid. \n\nThere may come a time where he tries to make a real apology.

Shame on your paternal family for not admonishing him every single time he dares show his shameful little weasel face. May your haunt him till his dying day.

Of course you\u2019re not, you poor thing. \n\nI\u2019m always disappointed but never really surprised at how much families want to sweep things under the carpet so things are good on the surface.

I don\u2019t know him but I can guarantee it. And he\u2019ll have enablers around him who will help feed into that narrative. After, what mother wants to look at her son and see a piece of shit? Far easier to blame circumstances or relationships or even your mother. \n\nYou did nothing wrong. And your anger is justified and valid.\n\nPlease know it has NOTHING to do with who you are.

First of all, maybe I missed it, but I don't see where OP said she doesn't consider her father her father. Just because she doesn't consider his kids to be her siblings, doesn't then mean he's not her father. That doesn't even make any sense. Family relationships are not only about blood \u2014 they're about history and connection and the roles you play in one another's lives.\n\nBut even if she did say that, it doesn't invalidate her feelings. You're acting like OP is a computer program \u2014 as if by saying that she doesn't consider him a father (because he hasn't acted like one), that that should somehow erase the pain and anger of having been rejected and wronged.\n\nThat's not how humans work. Hurt feelings don't follow the rules of logic (especially the non-sensical \"logic\" you're trying to peddle).\n\n> Also consider that your resentment might be a factor in why your dad never tried to do or be a better parent, and not have you involved with your sibling. \n\nAnd this is some straight up bullshit victim-blaming. \n\n\"Have you considered that maybe you not giving your husband enough attention is why he cheated on you?\"\n\n\"Have you considered that that short skirt is why you got assaulted?\"\n\n\"Have you considered that maybe if you listened better, your parents wouldn't have gotten divorced?\"\n\nWhat the hell dude \u2014 OF COURSE OP is resentful.

If dad heard more than he wanted to, oh well.", "Of course it was immature: OP is a seventeen year old who's been neglected for years. Expecting a fully mature response to seeing her father being a real father is unrealistic at best.", "Be a better person than he was? \n\nOP already is, by having survived his abuse.", "Right?  I've got to say, who marries a guy and has kids with him if he treats his kid that bad too?!? I'm so sorry OP.", "It\u2019s also possible they just didn\u2019t know how to be a parent or just hadn\u2019t figured it out yet but they eventually figure it out, just too late.", ">l it shows he was always capable of being an engaged parent \n\nI disagree. 12 years is a long time to mature. OP doesn't say how old Dad is.", "Well he's not a deadbeat asshole to them", "I read minions to refer to the deadbeat's defenders, not his kids.", "\"Sure, I was a horrible friend to you, I slept with your boyfriend and stole money from you, whatever, but I've made two new friends since then and I've been really nice to both of them! And that cancels out me being an asshole to you, so why are you still mad at me?\"", "She made someone else's party about her becuase she was jealous. That's AH behavior regradless of how people want to justify it", "But this child posting doesn't even give any details on the custody situation. Dad could live across the country, mom has 100% custody and was perfectly happy making sure dad never gots a chance to see the OP. So many details lacking.", "First he'd have to take responsibility. Honestly, this could have been a really good opportunity for him to demonstrate growth by TAKING RESPONSIBILITY that he just threw away. I wonder how different it would be for the OP if her dad had been like \"You know what, that was pretty shitty of me and I understand why you feel that way. I feel shitty that I did that. There's nothing I can do to excuse myself, but if you'd like to begin the healing process, we can start right now.\"", "Let's even entertain for a whimsical second of giving him the benefit of the doubt that he has turned over a new leaf, and learned some sort of life's lesson or... whatever the fuck lol.  And is doing right by his kids now, and lets imagine for a second he regrets estranging himself from his daughter.  Maybe he has no idea how to even approach his daughter now to mend that, and so has kept his distance because of the awkward and unsure way of how to approach and begin to rectify it.  That's probably giving him too much credit, I know.  But just imagine so for the sake of my point...\n\nEven then OP is NTA.  Even then she is absolutely entitled to how she feels and how she spoke to him.  Because the dad here fucked that up.  The dad let that relationship between them go to shit, and be nonexistent.  It's not up to OP to extend jack shit for an olive branch.  Her reaction is exactly what he ought to expect until ***he*** comes forward to make it right.  He's the adult.  He's the \"parent\".  The ball starts in his court, not hers.\n\nSucks the rest of the family can't see that, and sucks that OP obviously lacks the support to cope with that.", "> they\u2019re too full of pride or stubborn to make it right so they fuck it up more by putting it off forever.\n\nYes. I\u2019ve seen this type of behaviour for other things too \u2014 some people opt out of trying to fix things or make amends when they screw up, because they don\u2019t want to admit to their mistakes and put the work in. They give in to their aversion to facing their errors. So they put off dealing with it even more, or hit reset like it\u2019s a video game, and focus on the do-over.\n\nOP is still a minor, only 17, and her father has long since written her off. He can\u2019t change the past, but there\u2019s still lots of present and future, and he doesn\u2019t want to try to change those. Why TF should she be happy for him? He\u2019s earned nothing from her.", "potentially but as i have said in another reply he left when op was 5 and had another child when op was 11 meaning he would have had to figure that out in 6 years and sure maybe that the case, but that still makes him the ahole because he has had 6 years after 'figuring it out' to try and reconnect with the child he abandoned and after a certain point that becomes an active not passive choice because he knows how to be an engaged parent and knows he isn't being that for his eldest child.", "he abandoned op when they were 5 and had the next kid when op was 11 so it was only 6 years where he wasn't raising any kids. Sure someone can change a lot in 6 years but maybe its just me but if i wasn't capable of being an engaged parent and something magically made me capable one of the first things i would want to do is make amends to the child i have been letting down for the last 6 yeas.", "Betcha he is, but is the type that any negative emotion gets turned into anger. \n\nHell, look at the way he greeted his older child: \u201cUh... Hey (my name)... Um how have you... Been... It's..um been a while\u201d.\n\nHis failures as a parent and a human being are staring him right in the face, literally, and he sublimates all that shame directly into anger, because it's OP's fault that dad feels bad.", "The phrase \"to even the score\" just hits so hard I'm sorry I felt afraid and I'm just reading about it here", "Still not their fault", "I want to echo that I don\u2019t think the person you\u2019re responding to is telling anyone to forgive the parent. As someone who has endured abandonment and abuse from (one of) my parent(s), the idea that I could *never* get over what happened to me is actually really disheartening. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t think anyone has to \u201cget over\u201d what happened either. It\u2019s more that the idea that it would be so deeply painful for forever just\u2026 it fucking sucks. It\u2019s like looking down a dark tunnel and being like, what\u2019s the point? I\u2019m broken forever? \n\nAfter a lot of work, though, I\u2019ve gotten to a point where it hurts less. Like Caimthehero, I don\u2019t think about it all the time and rather than \u201cget over,\u201d I think I\u2019ve just learned to either heal or grow bigger than what happened to me. There\u2019s a way forward *for me,* not anyone else, and to feel that more days than most is strengthening. Not all days, but more than before. (And as YourAddiction said, holding that pain doesn\u2019t make you \u201cweak,\u201d but regardless of forgiveness, it helps to know it doesn\u2019t have to hurt so badly always if that\u2019s not helpful for you.)", "Respectfully I never said forgiveness is strength nor an obligation. I said that you can find the strength to move past it, it doesn't fuck you up permanently like atealein said. Thinking about it more atalean might have meant to say something like \"You can choose to never forgive your father for walking out on you\" rather than \"you can never get over having your dad walk out...\"\n\nThat said it sounds like OP is handling it well and her father's side needs to be reminded that he completely neglected his duties as a father to her and that him being reminded of his continued failures (they're still happening) is not her problem to spare his feelings.", "Doesn\u2019t really matter if she never sees him. That doesn\u2019t mean to be snarky at gramma\u2019s party. That\u2019s rude as hell. \n\nShe apparently caused enough of a scene to have multiple family members talk to her about it afterward. It may not have been a full blown freak out but it was still rude.", "she spoke with the grandma about that  apologized, and she understood why she was upset and didn't take up for a deadbeat", "tl;dr?", "Wow, what an absolutely shit take. There are very small nuggets of good advice in there surrounded by a metric ton of victim blaming and abuse apologist bullshit. I hope you don't have children because if this is how you view parental responsibilities, I can't imagine they are having a good upbringing.", "Found the dad.", "This is one of the grossest and weirdest comment I\u2019ve ever read on this sub. \n\nI\u2019m flabbergasted by your logic.", "Then dad\u2019s response should have been, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.

Get over it and be happy I made a new family away from you.\u201d That was an AH move no matter what the situation was.", "\"Get over it cuz I can't change the past\"\n\nYou can change the present AND the future, but you choose to blame you kid instead?\n\nNTA OP, but your dad and his family are.", "Hell, an \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d and a hug would probably have gone a long way. Don\u2019t know if I would have been able to stop myself from introducing myself to the wife, and offering her my address, in case he decided to, you know, act like a father\u2026\n\nOP, your paternal relatives suck. Did any of them try to spend any time with you to fill that huge spot in your life?", "It's like he's painting her, his daughter, as a mistake he'd rather just forget about. That's insulting.", "Maybe this was his (shitty) attempt at becoming involved? I get why the OP is pissed but that\u2019s when you go the dad and say \u201cpops, if you want a relationship with me, then we need to talk about WTF happened\u201d. Maybe there\u2019s more to the story of why of why dad was shitty.", "OP sees Dad being present with them *now*. Nothing says that he was always this way with his present kids either. It's very possible he's only been like this recently.  \n\n\nI agree with the last part and that's part of what makes me wonder if his turnaround is recent and he just doesn't know how to make amends.", "tbh it wasn\u2019t lost on me that he didn\u2019t come back for ME but my grandpa not being a safety net just in case his plan backfired", "My dad's third wife (the one that stuck I guess lol they're still together) gave up her kids to be with my father (long story but the gist is she had been court ordered not to have any men living in her house with her kids, and she moved my father in on the second date...) and my father basically appreciated that in a \"she gave up everything to be with me\" kinda way. Dude's got problems lol", "It takes two people to do that though. She couldn't have walked in if he didn't open the door. But as someone in a similar situation, i understand the feeling of how it's somehow easier to blame the other person for it", "Actually it was the deadbeat who broke his marriage .  What\u2019s with everyone always blaming the affair partner . The only person that\u2019s responsible is the one who decided to cheat!!", "The kids aren't the 'minions' defending his father.", "The fact that she had to apologize means that it was asshole behavior.

Thank you for having the guts. \n\nI think people like the person you\u2019re responding to are young as well and lack the common sense to realize just wtf they\u2019re saying.", "TL;DR: Helpmeimtooangry does a bunch of victim blaming, abuse apology and implies OP is as bad/at fault as the father. \n\nYou saved some brain cells not reading it.", "Lol, what? He didn't say that and he did say he was sorry that apparently was after daughter snapped at him.", "Awkward like running into an ex when you\u2019re out with your new love.", "So true.  My father kept in contact with my older brother, but my sister and I did not have that with our dad.  He couldn't be bothered.", "My 24 year old daughter and her father have zero relationship now, after he decided life would be better without us and walked out in 2016.  He just had his 60th birthday, and the majority of his family were invited to a party to celebrate, minus her.  How do I know?  Because she and I have a good relationship with his younger brother (by 11 months), and he refuses to treat us like dirt.  I also understand that he has quite the close connection now to his girlfriend's nieces/nephews (she has no kids of her own), and loves to spend time with them.  It boggles my mind how he can use his hatred for me and hold that against his own daughter.  He was a father once to her - so much so, that I was the one who felt like the third wheel, and at times thought that maybe I should be the one that left them so they be happy together.  He broke her heart, and that is something I don't think either of us will ever be able to forgive him for that.", "That\u2019s part of the process. Maybe he\u2019s mad at himself and is acting out and attacking other. Maybe dad needs some therapy.", "True. He was not looking to be faithful for sure. They were both horrible IMO and my poor mother was the one left behind to raise 4 children on her own.", "It takes two to tango, true", "Ohhh... I guess I misunderstood. My bad.", "it was justified behavior", "Context does matter. OP was abandoned by her father TWICE. your logic is cold and i don't understand it. Are you the dad's new wife? Or another parent who has abandoned their children? Idk why you think OP isn't allowed to be hurt by this.", "Right?! What in the victim-blaming hell was that?!", "I generally hold back, also because some can be trolls, but this comment was too much", "Thank you for the award! \ud83d\ude0a", "He also obviously got his parenting shit together give or take 6 years ago when he actually decided to be a dad to the second kid he had - at which time OP was 11 years old... 11. Then he had another kid 3 years later (when OP was about 14) and he's been \"Dadding\" that whole time for the shiny new kids. What exactly did OP do at *5 years old* that made her father bounce and not give a shit? \n\nWhy didn't he come back and attempt a relationship when OP was 11, or 14, when his other kids were born? What kind of person is his wife to be okay with a father that abandoned his oldest child for 6 years before they had their own kid together, but still be okay with having him as the father of your kids? \n\nOPs Dad is a HUGE GAPING AH, his relatives shaming OP are also huge AHs and his wife is also undoubtedly an AH (the only thing that'd change my mind is if she didn't know about OP or was lied to about the circumstances of their relationship). OP is NTA, like not at all.", "Because it's not her job to dictate his actions. His job is to act like a parent. She is not in a position to guide him to do his job.", "Nah, man. You don't get to ditch a kid for six years and expect them to be happy and ready to forgive when you get around to give a shit. He's the adult, it's his responsibility.

She chose not to suppress her feelings after being ambushed by his presence at the party\u2026.and not immediately going right to her to talk, hug, introduce her SIBLINGS\u2026.\n\nHow was he showing he was capable? In a room with three of his children, he chose to focus on the ones he sees every day, instead of simply acknowledging OP. \n\nIt takes more than watching your father be an actual parent to other children to heal. Her response was authentic, and it showed her which of her family members would not be supportive or understanding. \n\nSometimes, to heal, we have to Make A Statement.", "I meant that girls are pushed to be more mature and adult, and society gives grown men a pass on lack of adulting. But yes, some men just have no idea and don't even try with daughters. Good point.", "Also, are you from Wales? My family came over a long time ago, but I have a Welsh and Scottish ancestry.", "That would require admission of true fault. Papa deadbeat ain't got the balls to do that.", "Yup so you shouldn\u2019t put more blame on her. The deadbeat has all the blame", "Asshole always try to justify thoer behavior. She did it because she was jealous and wanted to hurt him, and she did so at someone else's event. That's an asshole.
