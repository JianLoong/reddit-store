Since then I saw him maybe 3-4 times at family functions. From my family, I found out he got married and had other kids. I figured he wouldn't have been a good dad just because of the type of dad he's been to me my whole life. \n\n\nYesterday was my great grandma\u2019s 100th birthday so we were doing a big party for her. A few days ago I found out from my grandma my dad is going to be there and more than likely with his kids. I was still going to go though because I've always been close to my great-grandma. \n\nAbout an hour of me being at this party my dad, his wife, and their 2 kids walk in. The kids were about 3 and 6 years old. I watched them off and on through the party... My dad was actually being a dad, he was playing with his kids and listening to them, even had cute nicknames for them. \n\nThen my dad came up to me and said pretty much \u201cUh... Hey (my name)... Um how have you... Been... It's..um been a while\u201d. I will admit I was upset seeing my dad act like the person he never was to me and has never put in the effort. So I said I'm okay I then pointed over to his kids and said congrats on actually being a dad this time around. My dad got mad and said he's sorry but he can't change the past... But he never even puts up an effort now to call or text me or wants to come to visit me. I then had other family members tell me I need to grow up and get over it and now be happy for my dad.

Get over your dad not being there and be happy for him? Um no, you don\u2019t have to do that.", "NTA. Your family members saying this are assholes. You can never get over having your dad walk out of your life and not love you, not fight for you, not care for you. This is not on you, it is on him. And you DO NOT HAVE TO BE HAPPY FOR HIM. Yes, he cannot change the past, but has he tried to change anything in the present? No? Then that's the answer if you should care for how he is, if you should be cordial with him or happy for him.", "NTA.\n\n\"The past\"? \n\nOkay. Then it's his responsibility to fix it in the present and for the future. His deadbeat ass didn't even try. If anything you were too nice. Should've given a lot of choice words to him.", "NTA. You called out your dad for his bs. He could easily change and try and put in effort with you, but has clearly chosen to do otherwise.", "NTA. You have every right to be upset.\n\nHe is right that he can not change the past, and it's good that he is more present with his other children. At the same time, being more present the 2nd time around with his other kids will only help heal HIM. It won't heal YOU.\n\nYour feelings are valid, OP.", "Abandoned by your father, scorned by your family, plus sarcastic quips; this is the making of a real superhero's origin. \n\nSo take your wings my child and dump buckets of bird poop on your villainous father and his minions so that their outer appearance's may resemble the crap they are on the inside.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nYour dad left you and you called him out on it. Ignore those other family members, they are just trying to justify what he did to you. Lmao that remark you made to him was funny though. I applaud you for saying that.", "People actually told you to be happy for your deadbeat father for starting a new family?", "NTA he may have had whatever issues he had back then,  but that doesn't mean you don't get to feel the way you do about it. It's his fault he left. It's his fault you feel this way, and if he's man enough to leave one family and start another, he's man enough to be confronted by the daughter he abandoned.", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand why adults expect a neglected child to be happy to watch their dad not neglect family#2. I say block the haters and move on. Live your best life and eff the nay sayers.", "NTA - you said it so perfectly I wonder if this post is even real.\n\nYou have every right to be upset and say what you said \u2026 no yelling or swearing.", "NTA, he can't change the past, but he's responsible for the past. All those years he wasn't there for you, he made an active choice not to be your dad. He can also change the present, which he has shown no intent of doing.", "NTA he got mad cause he is guilty as it can get.", "NTA\n\nIf he wants a relationship with you,  he needs to put in the work.", "NTA. That was mild compared to what you could've said to him.", "NTA\n\nAnd no, you do NOT need to \"grow up and get over it\" those family members have clearly never had a parent completely reject him like your asshole dad. \n\nYou can be civil but you absolutely can have boundaries. If your dad isn't willing to put in the work to form some type of relationship with you, you do NOT have to chase him.", "NTA  \n\n\n\"Congrats on actually being a dad this time round\" was actually nicer than I think I'd have wanted to be.", "Get over being abandoned by your father? More than your dad, his family is the TA. Clearly, they enabled him. \n\n\nNta.", "NTA, he has some serious problems and needs to make more of an effort which will be hard to build any relationship together. I understand you are sad but eventually you\u2019ll learn you can\u2019t hold it against him forever", "NTA.\n\nI understand why you were upset when you saw your dad being a good dad to his new kids, but not to you. It's natural to feel hurt and angry when someone who is supposed to love and care for you doesn't seem to.\n\nYour dad's actions have had a real impact on you, and it's okay to feel the way you do. You don't have to \"get over it\" or \"be happy for your dad\" just because he's being a better dad to his new kids.\n\nIt sounds like you're still processing everything that's happened, and that's okay. You don't have to have all the answers right now. Just take your time and do what feels right for you.\n\nIf you're interested in talking to someone about how you're feeling, there are a lot of resources available. You can talk to a therapist, counselor, or even a trusted friend or family member. Talking about your feelings can help you to process them and start to heal.\n\nIt's also important to remember that you're not alone. There are many other people who have been through similar experiences. There are support groups and online forums where you can connect with others who understand what you're going through.\n\nHealing takes time, but it is possible. Be patient with yourself and don't be afraid to reach out for help.", "NTA, if your family are supporting you\u2019re dad then fuck them too", "NTA\nI am really sorry your dad is like this. \nHe actually had a few years to be a dad. He deserved to be called out. He wronged you and he deserved it. \nActions or the lack there of have consequences.", "What did he honestly expect? You were around 10 as he decided to have another child. You very much still were a child. You are a minor to this very day. \n\n\nHe can't change the past. But he is behaving like an ass now.", "NTA\n\nI'm proud of you for speaking up.", "NTA and honestly f those other family members telling you to grow up. Like it's you that needs to grow up when your dad wasn't grown up enough to take responsibility and be a father to you? What a bunch of bs.", "(High Five!!!) NTA OP because you said what he needed to hear from you and if he resents it then he knows that he was an AH. If he can't apologize for his past and try to make amends then screw him.", "NTA and anyone who says different is the worst kind of AH. Being sarcastic in a private conversation between you two is much more mature than he has ever been. Your mom has done a great job raising you. I'm sure you're better off with the stability and strength of your mother than if that pathetic excuse of bones was involved.", "NTA\n\n\"I can't change the past\"\n\nHe's not even changing the present", "F his happiness lol he\u2019s a loser", "NTA your still a child, and you said what you felt, and he absolutely deserves to understand that he needs to apologise and mean it. The rest of the family should be telling him to make amends with you.", "NTA! This is not in the past. It is ongoing. Why should you be happy for somebody who continues to show you no regard?", "NTA\n\nWhy should you grow up and get over it? You are only 17 and have been saddled with a useless father. He should be embarrassed not angry. And you have no reason to be happy for him. \n\nHis failure in no way reflects upon you as a person.", "NTA, too many times young people, especially girls, are told to be well mannered and not to express negative emotions. He effed up, not you. He's an embarrassment to himself, not you being an embarrassment to him. You called him out (epic mic drop move btw) and now he gets to self reflect in his failure to you. In no universe would you ever be the AH, unless you flipped over great grandma's cake (congrats to her for reaching 100)", "NTA\n\nHe is right that he can't change the past, but he could have attempted to make an effort at any point and he could acknowledge that he was a crap absent parent to you and at least offer a sincere apology.\n\nGood for you for standing up for yourself", "NTA Your feelings matter, don't let them tell you otherwise. Screw them all.", "NTA... gotta be a pretty crappy person to tell the victim to get over it and be happy for the irresponsible father.\n\n\"Hey look everyone i'm doing it right with my new kids, while still doing it wrong with my first one, let's be happy for me!\"", "NTA. Passive aggression & sarcasm is the best way to deal with shitty parents.", "NTA\n\nOh hell no.", "You were way nicer than I would've been. Your family members aren't much better than your father. Time to rethink these relationships. NTA.", "You should have said \"have we met before?\" \n\nNTA", "NTA, easy for them to say you should let it go when they were not abandoned.", "YTA, but he totally deserved it.\n\nIt is not bad to be an asshole sometimes.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
