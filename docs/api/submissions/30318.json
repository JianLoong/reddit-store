{"id": 30318, "submission_id": "17nv1yc", "title": "AITA for asking my husband to stay away an extra day when he travels?", "selftext": "My husband travels for both work and pleasure every 2-3 months for 3-7 days at a time. He gets restless without it so I have never had a problem with it. The only thing is for the day or so he comes back he is not helpful and wants to lounge about, sleep in and be gruff. We have a 6 year old who has some special needs and I hate thinking I have extra hands to help or an adult to talk to only to have another child to take care of. After the day he perks back up and things are okay again. \n\nAfter the last time, I asked him to stay away for another day. I told him I\u2019d pay for a hotel or he could crash with a friend. He got really upset and said he likes to crash in his bed and that he was hurt I didn\u2019t want him just because he wasn\u2019t \u2018useful.\u2019 I told him that it\u2019s just really hard to have him around when he\u2019s not himself. \n\nMy mom agrees with me, but my dad said he\u2019d be hurt by the sentiment. Our friends are split with most saying they get it but I presented it coldly. \n\nAITA for not wanting to deal with him when he first gets back?\n\nETA: The part that makes it hard is our daughter tries to get in his face and interact with him and he just wants to rest. I have to take her away and calm her down and try and get her happy again. They usually have a tight bond and she\u2019s used to getting his attention so it\u2019s just hard on both of us that he wants to laze for a day. \n\nI\u2019ve also suggested he come back on a work day and take the day off so he can relax. He\u2019s great when he\u2019s himself, but he gets exhausted traveling. \n\nAlso for those asking- I think there\u2019s a huge difference on the work trips and the personal trips. When work exhausts him I get it. When he\u2019s been traveling with his friends I do expect him to come back and chip in or just not make things harder. \n\nI think the hard part is really that this is an area we struggle to communicate on. I think in my head the compromise has always been I don\u2019t mind if you travel a lot, but when you\u2019re here I need you on because \u2018single parenting\u2019 is hard. \n\nLike so many on this thread I think we just need to communicate better.

I\u2019m the same way he is, fortunately I don\u2019t have kids and if I did I would suck it up like an adult.", "NTA, but you need to reframe it. It sounds like this is very disruptive to your daughter, which is causing you extra problems \n\nRemind him that when he travels, you are parenting a special needs child solo, which isn't all that relaxing either.

Unfortunately he needs to put on his big boy pants and be an adult.

Dad of the year, right there", "I don\u2019t think him being away longer is going to solve the problem. He\u2019s not going to feel rejuvenated if he\u2019s gone even longer. I get exhausted after time away from home and don\u2019t fully settle down until I\u2019ve had a day to relax at home. I get your frustrations and he\u2019s definitely an AH for not pulling his weight, but I just don\u2019t see how him staying away longer is going to help at all. Maybe the solution would be to hire a nanny for the day or something like that so you can get some extra help.", "ETA - with your reply below I would say NTA.\n\nINFO: re-when you say hard to have him around when not himself. Do you mean because you need to do stuff for him as well as your child (cook/clean etc...)? Or because he isn't as up for co-parenting as usual?", "I don\u2019t know. I get it - the day I get home and after for traveling I am useless. I\u2019m exhausted from traveling, having to unpack and needing to rest from the trip home itself. I\u2019m a single parent too so when I get home, my daughter needs me but she\u2019s old enough where I can be a little la6 and not have to jump right back into it. \n\nI think just because you tell him to stay away an extra doesn\u2019t actually fix the issue though. It\u2019s not that he \u201cuseless\u201d the day after. It\u2019s that when the situations are reversed you don\u2019t get that extra rest day at home. That day is what I refer to as the transition day from vacation brain to home/work brain. And maybe that\u2019s not what he is understanding - you rather he take that transition day not at home but he thinks that defeats the whole purpose (which it kinda does) unless he gets to come home first, drop everything off and go sleep at a hotel nearby.\n\nI say ESH - better communication is needed between y\u2019all and maybe him giving you that transition day at home to balance it out and maybe help him see why you struggle with him there.", "You\u2019re both avoiding the real problem (splitting home/child duties). ESH.", "ESH.\n\nNot only does he get to extend his work trips UP TO A WEEK(!?!) for pleasure while you are dealing with your special needs child, but then he comes home and isn't willing to pick up the extra slack for an entire extra day? Also, he's a complete AH for being cranky and impatient with your child. She missed Daddy and he's brushing her off.\n\nBut you acted childishly in how you discussed this with him. You need to tell him how he needs to pick up the slack in specific ways.

He'll likely fight you on it but you'll have the high ground because it's about your daughter's feelings & not about you, so you can bring it up over and over.

I still don\u2019t see how he can be exhausted from travel unless he\u2019s flying halfway around the world.", "This just pisses me off. My spouse also has a hobby that involves travel, and this past spring, his big trip lined up with my first week of spring insanity at the school I teach at (the first week of Senior Play prep - four weeks from zero to stage- and I'm the drama teacher and the faculty advisor for it). I have to be at school by 7:40 every morning... And I can't drop our kid at their school until 8:10... And the schools are 20 minutes apart. \n\nYou know what happened? My spouse arranged the carpools for our kid, for every morning that week. He arranged with friends to pick up and keep our kid the night I had staff meeting and wouldn't be done until 5:30. He placed food delivery orders for three nights that week so that I wouldn't have to cook, and he made sure our house cleaner came in the middle of the week. \n\nThat's the deal - if you're not going to be there to carry some of the load, you make damn sure some of the load is handled by someone not your partner, who's carrying the REST of the load. This \"I'll have a good time and you can do all the work\" is a sh**y way to run a marriage.\n\nAnd yes, when I travel solo (not as frequent), I do the leg work ahead of time to make sure he's not carrying it all.", "He'a not actually a good man if he never stops to think about what his wife needs.\n\nWhile, yes, she should learn to speak up, he also should be asking, and encouraging her to take as many days for fun as he does...\n\nhe isn't a good man if it doesn't even occur to him that his wife isn'y getting any rest.", "Reminds me of my friend. Her husband takes on a new obsessive hobby every 6 months, it seems. Now he's into photography and taking weekend camping trips to take wildlife photos. I asked her once what her hobbies were and if she ever got any time to herself for herself and it was only in the last year or two that she got to go to a conference for two days. No hobbies. Just two days and his parents came over to help take care of their two kids. She deserves better.", "Except he apparently isn\u2019t doing that first bit, he\u2019s cold and abrupt with his daughter on the first day back from trips.", "The simple/obvious solution is to have the same deal for both parties. If one of them goes on a trip of any kind, they both get a recharge day upon their return", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I think it puts this on marriage counseling level if he finds it hard to (re?)connect with his daughter.  Are the daughter's differences from her peers something he is having difficulty with?", "Sometimes, being a single parent while your partner travels for work or for fun is hard. OP asking her husband to make things less difficult for her doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t love him. It just means she\u2019s had a hard week and is expressing that to him.", "Could also just be plain insecurity.", "Major red flags!", "Or partying really hard while away.", "Ah your spouse sounds like a true partner and I\u2019m so happy to even hear those relationships do exist! Being considerate & thoughtful seems very reasonable to me.\n\nLove that you support eachother like that \u2764\ufe0f", "It\u2019d be impossible for me to explain their relationship fully but he has asked more than a few times & encouraged her but she just doesn\u2019t want to be away from the baby- which I understand", "Yeah, he needs an attitude adjustment if he wants compromise.", "Why would a kid care? Mine loving having a sitter who devotes time to playing with them when mom and dad are tired.\n\nI have no idea why you think ONE DAY of mom and dad being lazy and present but not giving a bath/making meals/wiping butts/etc would be something a kid would even care about (besides looking forward to having a person whose only responsibility is keeping the kid happy and taken care of.)\n\nUnless you don\u2019t have kids.", "Not going to lie - it takes work, and a willingness to talk things out and to be honest about how things are going. It was different when our kiddo was tiny and I was a stay-at-home mom; I was brutally bad about saying 'I can't do this; it's too much', because in my head it was my 'job' to take care of everything and admitting I couldn't was 'failure'.   \n\n\nIt took a long time to figure out how to say 'I can't do this alone when you're on trips' and to work past my own sense of 'I SHOULD be able to do this, why can't I?'. It helps immensely that I have a spouse who was willing to listen, and to say 'OK, what changes do we BOTH need to make to make this work?'.   \n\n\nWhen I went back to work, we actually scheduled 'discussion time' every weekend for the first, oh, three or four months, when we'd look at what we'd done, and what was working and what balls were being dropped. Let's be blunt here, the fact that we're well off enough that we could say 'We need someone to clean the the house every two weeks, and if they could do the bedding/towel laundry, that would be great' and hire someone was a huge help. We could look at the places we were failing and patch some of them with money - and not everyone can do that. Although, realistically, any family that can afford multiple pleasure trips a year can probably afford someone to clean the house every few weeks.  \n\n\nMostly though, it's about being able and willing to listen, and to compromise. And, yeah, that's hard. We've both had therapy over the years to sort stuff out - for me it's my total unwillingness to admit I can't handle something - and that helps too. But, for us, it still comes down to \"I love you, I want this to work, what do I have to do to make it more likely\". We've had our share of fights, and struggles, and upset where we don't want even want to look at each other, much less talk it out, but we work through that. It is possible.", "Still sounds like a shitty dude if he\u2019s happy to leave her with the baby to go on solo holidays and is ignorant to the fact that he\u2019s lacking in the parenting department, and that somehow it\u2019s on her for not spelling this out to him"]}
