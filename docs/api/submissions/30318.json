{"id": 30318, "submission_id": "17nv1yc", "title": "AITA for asking my husband to stay away an extra day when he travels?", "selftext": "My husband travels for both work and pleasure every 2-3 months for 3-7 days at a time. He gets restless without it so I have never had a problem with it. The only thing is for the day or so he comes back he is not helpful and wants to lounge about, sleep in and be gruff. We have a 6 year old who has some special needs and I hate thinking I have extra hands to help or an adult to talk to only to have another child to take care of. After the day he perks back up and things are okay again. \n\nAfter the last time, I asked him to stay away for another day. I told him I\u2019d pay for a hotel or he could crash with a friend. He got really upset and said he likes to crash in his bed and that he was hurt I didn\u2019t want him just because he wasn\u2019t \u2018useful.\u2019 I told him that it\u2019s just really hard to have him around when he\u2019s not himself. \n\nMy mom agrees with me, but my dad said he\u2019d be hurt by the sentiment. Our friends are split with most saying they get it but I presented it coldly. \n\nAITA for not wanting to deal with him when he first gets back?\n\nETA: The part that makes it hard is our daughter tries to get in his face and interact with him and he just wants to rest. I have to take her away and calm her down and try and get her happy again. They usually have a tight bond and she\u2019s used to getting his attention so it\u2019s just hard on both of us that he wants to laze for a day. \n\nI\u2019ve also suggested he come back on a work day and take the day off so he can relax. He\u2019s great when he\u2019s himself, but he gets exhausted traveling. \n\nAlso for those asking- I think there\u2019s a huge difference on the work trips and the personal trips. When work exhausts him I get it. When he\u2019s been traveling with his friends I do expect him to come back and chip in or just not make things harder. \n\nI think the hard part is really that this is an area we struggle to communicate on. I think in my head the compromise has always been I don\u2019t mind if you travel a lot, but when you\u2019re here I need you on because \u2018single parenting\u2019 is hard. \n\nLike so many on this thread I think we just need to communicate better.

It\u2019s not that he \u201cuseless\u201d the day after. It\u2019s that when the situations are reversed you don\u2019t get that extra rest day at home. That day is what I refer to as the transition day from vacation brain to home/work brain. And maybe that\u2019s not what he is understanding - you rather he take that transition day not at home but he thinks that defeats the whole purpose (which it kinda does) unless he gets to come home first, drop everything off and go sleep at a hotel nearby.\n\nI say ESH - better communication is needed between y\u2019all and maybe him giving you that transition day at home to balance it out and maybe help him see why you struggle with him there.", "You\u2019re both avoiding the real problem (splitting home/child duties).

He'll likely fight you on it but you'll have the high ground because it's about your daughter's feelings & not about you, so you can bring it up over and over.
