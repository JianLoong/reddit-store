I have been with my partner for over 10 years.

When C started to drive at 16, he got her a car when she started college she went to college with a Jeep Wrangler just to show the things he has done over the years now to the issue since C only got six tickets for graduation she said it would be her sister J, my mom, her 2 bff K& J, her adopted God Father F and myself. A few days ago we found out that J could not attend .so I was like ok M my partner can go. now today she sent me a text saying she does not want him to go. She wants her adoptive godmother to go. Now understand I have nothing against the Godmother. The godparents are wonderful people. They are actually her sister J's godparents but they treat her as their goddaughter too because just like her father, her godparents are deadbeats. Now the problem is she is telling everyone how fu- up of a person I am for telling her to invite M to her graduation so we have argued about this, and she thinks I\u2019m wrong for being upset, but the reason for me being upset is more that I\u2019m disappointed in her for not respecting someone who has done so much for her.

Her picking to invite her godparent just means she has a closer bond with that person than her step dad, which makes sense if step dad came into her life at 12 or older, and the godparent was in her life longer. Not having the same relationship with two people isn't a slight against the person who she's not as close to.

So it appears it\u2019s a learned behavior.", "I'm thinking about it the exact opposite way. The situation is now transactional because the daughter wanted it that way. If you're not family you are a tenant.", "There is a difference between respecting someone because they are the \u2018authority\u2019 and respecting someone because they are a person. It\u2019s two different mindsets around respect and the first one is generally used by people using authoritarian parenting styles to maintain control in the household. But because their idea of respect is based solely on hierarchy and control when either of those are questioned they take it as \u2018disrespectful\u2019.  They tend to use retaliatory means to regain control and \u2018respect\u2019. This backfires once it becomes clear to others because no one wants to be controlled by someone else. \n\nIt\u2019s clear that OP wants respect as an \u2018authority\u2019 while simultaneously disrespecting her daughter as a person.", "jeez... you shouldnt be a mum", "That may be the case, but it seems it would be easier to say \"I didn't invite him because I know he doesn't like these sort of things and I didn't want to make him feel obligated\", rather then creating a huge argument by saying she didn't want him there.", "Did you engineer my phone, because I'd be more than happy to send it to you.  So you can adjust the spell check.", "Damn, you're right. When OP says that their deadbeat dad hasn't contributed anything towards their college, it heavily implies not only that there is something college related to contribute to, but that step-dad did so. Turns out no assistance was needed from him... Very misleading.", "has nothing to do with authority, but the fact that he helped make the family whole when her ungrateful daughter's biofather ditched and the kid doesn't have the sense to appreciate let alone respect that contribution. Like if he's gone so far out of his way to make her life better, he is probably going to feel a little slighted that she didn't care to invite him to a big milestone event.", "The daughter is also 22, people are theorizing about reasons she might be justified in acting out but she\u2019s not a child, she should be able to explain to her mother why she\u2019s not inviting him instead of letting mom wonder and speculate which seems to be making this a big issue", "Room and board is expensive. They allowed her to live at home. That is a contribution. You people are reaching for anything to excuse the fact that this girl is unappreciative.", "We don\u2019t know that he \u2018made the family whole\u2019 which is an outdated concept btw. \n\nYou are literally using authoritarian ideas to dispute that they aren\u2019t authoritarian ideas. You are saying that because he provided material things that he is deserving of respect. Material things and money are often used as a form of control. \n\nIf you don\u2019t do as I say or what I want (respect my authority) then I will remove this one thing I do for you (provide you with money to help support you in your studies)\u2026and by these actions I show my unconditional love for you\u2026?\n\nA parent who actually respects their child as another human being would wonder why their SO wasn\u2019t invited, why their SO was disinvited after being invited and seek to understand the situation so that they can come to a mutual understanding if not a mutually beneficial solution. OP doesn\u2019t seem to have done any of that here. \n\nHe may feel slighted but as far as we know from OP he has zero feelings on this whatsoever. It is only OP who is creating an issue out of this for him. And as someone who has invested this much time and energy into this relationship, you\u2019d think he\u2019d be seeking to understand why this is his stepdaughter\u2019s stance and then respecting her decision. He has every right to feel hurt if he\u2019s cultivated the relationship with her as a person. If he\u2019s only cultivated an authoritarian relationship then he shouldn\u2019t be surprised that someone he\u2019s tried to control doesn\u2019t want him around.", "He supported the kid far more than he had to at all. I think the daughter gets the choice of who to invite, i think the mother-after a ticket became available-wanted her partner to go. Maybe the daughte4 chalks up the car and the basement as stepfather did it for the mom and mom did it for her while the mom knows the stepdad did it and doesnt consider herself involved sounds like they need to talk. But if they A talked about rent and she was given a year it is within the mom's rights to ask for it in 6 months if she felt disrespected. The daughter doesnt have a right to the room you live with your parents because they care about you, if the mom's offended by her daughters choices the dauggter can accept mom's deal etc. She can go NC if she wants but i think NTA but of course thats only if this is the full story.", "He didn't owe OPs daughter a car or a remodeled basement.

M owed her NONE of that.\n\nIt would have been COURTEOUS of her to ask him.", "I don't think he is owed anything but at this point I'd be LC with her and asking her to vacate my home.", "Yes, he is.  In many instances like this, the new partner refuses ANY financial help because \"they are not my kid\".  He is owed respect.  ESH except M.", "This attitude has always puzzled me. There seems to be an assumption that parents are obliged to do something something which the poster is never specific about other than the OP has no obligations to show gratitude or anything resembling it. This feels bizarre to me. Parents aren\u2019t obligated to do shit other than the legal minimum. There needs to be some middle ground between the legal minimum and the relationship being totally transactional. Now in the absence of specific like abuse, it feels to me that C needs to acknowledge M\u2019s contributions. He isn\u2019t even her bio dad. I think the lack of any acknowledgment is ridiculous.", "She is 22, he hasn't had to do anything for her since she was 18. \n\nI wonder what he will do now when younger sister turns 18, kick her out and not pay for college?", "Well now I'm question if she is unappreciative or if she just has people higher on the list of people she appreciates. Maybe she just appreciates the support of her godparents and close friends more than she appreciates the guy who didn't convince her mom to kick her out during college?", "Authoritarian? Come back to the real world, buddy. You're trying to big brain this one. If you don't think parents and parental figures deserve respect from their kids for providing for their kids, you are too far gone. It's not authoritarian to suggest that the daughter is not entitled to \"material things\" (i.e. room and board) when she's in college. If she doesn't respect or appreciate the people for providing that, then she can provide for herself. Not a hard concept.\n\nYou can say a 'whole' family is outdated all you want, but it doesn't make it less of a thing.
