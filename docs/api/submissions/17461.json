I have been with my partner for over 10 years. He has practically done everything for her and her sister J because they have a deadbeat dad who has not contributed anything to their education or anything else my partner on the other hand has done everything, A Father should do for them. When C started to drive at 16, he got her a car when she started college she went to college with a Jeep Wrangler just to show the things he has done over the years now to the issue since C only got six tickets for graduation she said it would be her sister J, my mom, her 2 bff K& J, her adopted God Father F and myself. A few days ago we found out that J could not attend .so I was like ok M my partner can go. now today she sent me a text saying she does not want him to go. She wants her adoptive godmother to go. Now understand I have nothing against the Godmother. The godparents are wonderful people. They are actually her sister J's godparents but they treat her as their goddaughter too because just like her father, her godparents are deadbeats. Now the problem is she is telling everyone how fu- up of a person I am for telling her to invite M to her graduation so we have argued about this, and she thinks I\u2019m wrong for being upset, but the reason for me being upset is more that I\u2019m disappointed in her for not respecting someone who has done so much for her. Eg: cars, vacations, and money. he has treated both my kids as if they were his children.\nC is 22 lives at home and only pays her and my cellphone bills. She had moved out when she was 18 to live with her boyfriend things didn't work out and she moved back home so we redid the basement for her she has her own space my partner M built everything for her today I was so upset I told her I give her six months to start paying rent or move out.\nSo AITA FOR feeling this way?\nEdit: 1-when she found out one of bff could not attend she told me and we discussed M attending and she said yes.at first she did not want my mom to go she wanted M to go then she changed her mind to my mom so when Her bff could not attend and she said M could.and now she changed her mind again.\n2- They have a good relationship and no he is not a perv with my kids.\n3-Found out from My younger daughter J that she asked him not to go because he would just sit there quietly. he is a lot older.\n4-her paying her car insurance was discussed many times but she never paid anything. Rent was discussed also and she asked for another year I just made it 6months after this disrespect.", "created_utc": 1684319643, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13jxxjb/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_she_have_to_start/", "score": 147, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you choose to disrespect the wishes of people who are being generous to you, you should expect that generosity to dry up.\n\nIt doesn't appear to me that OP is being unreasonable in feeling like M and her as a partnership are being disrespected by her daughter in this case given that daughter is going around saying it's \"fucked up\" that she wanted her to invite M.\n\nAlso, the way in which she is withdrawing support is very reasonable IMO, 6 months is more than enough time to find a new place or secure a job and she's giving her daughter a reasonable choice.\n\nIt would be *controlling* if the punishment or threat was unreasonable and designed to coerce the daughter into specific action, which I don't see as the case here. Instead I see that OP is upset that daughter is not respectful of the privileges she has and her behaviour towards OP and M, and is choosing to withdraw those privileges.

He may be financially supportive but that doesn\u2019t always make someone a good parent. And same with the godmother, maybe her and the godmother are closer than her and the step dad. \n\nAnd I wouldn\u2019t say op is Ta for charging her rent if she just wanted to do it for the sake of it, but she\u2019s only doing it because she\u2019s not getting her way. But if she charges rent then op should pay her own phone bill instead of the daughter paying it for her. \n\nI also wonder what ops response to the daughter saying she wants to invite godmother instead of step dad was, because I doubt she\u2019s really going around saying the mom is an \u201cfu-person\u201d for only trying to invite step dad.

HOWEVER. Material support is not always what a kid needs. Kids can love deadbeat dads and reject caring step dads. It's exasperating to watch, and must be even worse to be at the receiving end of.  I think you and your partner need investigate just WHY she is rejecting him.  She clearly feels strongly about this. You need to get to the root of it.

All you're going to do by trying to punish your daughter here is to push her away - and essentially confirm that she's right to be wary of your husband by the way. Is that what you want?\n\nOh, and I got an invite to their post-graduate degree ceremony a few years later. Turns out that letting people build their own relaitionship with you at their own speed actually works better than assuming you're owed something because you're sexing up one of their parents.", "> I have another possible guess, M is well off and generous with money but he is an ah to the kids in other ways. \n\nI also got that vibe.

That doesn\u2019t deserve a cookie or praise lol not even recognition imo.\n\nAnd regardless of you personally thinking that it is reasonable to punish your children for no reason other than not doing specifically what you want that will only benefit you, the fact that remains is that she\u2019s doing it out of spite.", "It\u2019s a fascinating conundrum to define, those years between being a child and an adult. A child on one hand, adult when it is convenient. Until adult, and no longer able to pull that child card.\n\nI\u2019ve gone to a loose definition of your daily needs and existence are your own primary concern and not someone else\u2019s.

Even 10 years of generous financial support and otherwise disinterested parenting seem like they should justify some level of reciprocation, even if there is no love from the daughter\u2019s side.", "The daughter didn't uninvite her husband. The husband was never invited. It's the entire premise of the post. How can you trust anything she says with that distortion.", "Tbh, it might not necessarily be rejection but *perceived* rejection, though I agree there needs to be a discussion to see if there's an underlying issue where OP is receptive to criticism towards themself and their partner, so daughter can speak how she feels. I think that it stems from that the daughter didn't pick her new step dad, her parent did. (Using step dad for clarity purposes and it's shorter than typing \"OP's partner\" each time.) He isn't owed a certain kind of relationship with her just because he's with her parent, which OP has an issue with (the \"I'm disappointed she didn't pick him when her father is a dead beat\" thing leads me to think this). Her picking to invite her godparent just means she has a closer bond with that person than her step dad, which makes sense if step dad came into her life at 12 or older, and the godparent was in her life longer. Not having the same relationship with two people isn't a slight against the person who she's not as close to. It would be *nice* if she had invited step dad, but it's *her* graduation, *she* is the one being celebrated, therefore she should pick how she wants to be celebrated. She doesn't want a kegger in the front yard, she just wants someone who she feels closer to at *her* graduation", "i agree totally with this i mean did the op even ask why she didnt want him there? there has to be more to this story than just the material aspects.", "Yeah, I noticed every single thing OP listed about what M has done for her was materialistic, no examples of actual parenting or an actual relationship. Love and support is what matters, not buying her stuff.", "I mean she cannot control whether she feels attached to him", "I agree. I don't have an issue with her charging rent, she's an adult that's totally her right. However her logic and her entititlement to the inviitations and who gets them was all I was referring too. I would think this conversation of rent would have already come up given the graduation, it just seems petty for it only to come up because op is mad her daughter isn't doing what she wants.\n\nSeems like op wants her cake and to eat it too - her daughter is a child when it suits OPs argument and an adult when it supports OPs argument. She should probably pick a side.", "Oh I agree! But OP seems to be placing such an emphasis on how much money her partner has spent on the kid", "That\u2019s also a very good point. I wonder what he had to say about not getting invited.", "Ah. I wouldn't consider that a lie. More that she expected her partner to be invited so him not being is uninvited in her view. I think a lie is a stretch. A different interpretation is more likely.", "> He isn't owed a certain kind of relationship with her just because he's with her parent\n\nSo few parents and step parents grasp that. Probably four or five cases a day on this sub, from either parent or kid", "Yeah. OP doesn't know and does not seem to want to find out. Which makes me suspect that the kid is not the AH here.", "Yeah from me too. This HAS to be a skewed perspective, very one-sided. My read is that M has been trying to buy C\u2019s love.", "Yup.\n\nIt exasperates me how *uninterested* OP is in why her kid is doing this, even after dozens of people have raise this issue. I guess Op doesn't want to hear anything bad about OPs sugar daddy, oh I am so sorry, \"partner\".", "No indeed. But OP and her partner can control how much they pressure her to make her feel attached.", "If daughter has no issues taking M\u2019s money & living in M & mom\u2019s house then having him at graduation really shouldn\u2019t be a big deal. Seems like a very short-sighted decision made by daughter. \n\nAppears there will long-term consequences to her decision.", "It\u2019s very weird... OP is making this sound like a very transactional relationship & M is owed a ticket. Obviously, daughter does not agree. \n\nIt\u2019s a quagmire to me... if M\u2019s money & house are good enough to take & live in then maybe he is owed something. Or maybe daughter is just stuck in a miserable situation. Regardless, seems like OP may want to figure out why M is not invited before applying any consequences.", "Interesting. I see it as an indicator that OP is incredibly willing to distort reality in order to gain sympathy for their argument. A title is something you have to think about and cannot change. For the the title is about as big a red flag as it gets so it's interesting you see it as something so unimportant.", "Which won't work", "Yes.  Perhaps the daughter is being clueless, but it seems more like she is deliberately making a very strong statement. But yeah, its turning into her Last Stand. Realistically she's gonna have to move out soon after that gigantic 'Fuck You' to him.", "I've never put thought into titles for posts on reddit to be honest. Different strokes for different folks!", "Seems not to be working here, that's for sure", "If daughter is running around telling people OP is effed up for being upset... either daughter is truly clueless or there are some puzzle pieces missing in this story. Clearly, there\u2019s a disconnect here.\n\nI wonder if M would get an invite if daughter had unlimited tickets or if it\u2019s just a hard no. Very strange situation.", "Maybe I don't either but I say what I mean and try have it match up to reality. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople remember the most important part of a message \"she uninvited her step dad\". A lot of people just read that and move on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt best OP is misleading people and I guess I find it hard to trust people who can so easily do that. Reality is a fluid thing to them and that scares me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for the exchange of thoughts!", "> some puzzle pieces missing \n\nYup. The sad thing is, I think OP is not keeping them from us, but genuinely has no clue as to why her daugher is not a fan of her partner. What I can't forgive is that OP doesn't seem to want to find out.", "I always enjoy a pleasant exchange!\n\nI have to disagree with your at best though. At best, she wrote what she felt - that her partner had been uninvited. I think perhaps you're over analyzing a throwaway title!", "I think in the context of life it's not just a throw away. Peoples words give insight into how they think and act. I am in my 30s and have had almost no family or friends drama in my life (nor has anyone else really in my family and friend group) and I think it's because we are honest, say what we mean, can communicate and not over react etc etc. It all adds up and I don't dismiss anything people do as throw away. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI get that we disagree though and you might be more right than me. I just don't take that kind of risk with people and holy shit what a good life it's been so far."]}
