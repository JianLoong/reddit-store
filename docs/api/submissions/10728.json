That makes you an asshole and a shitty friend.", "If you can't enjoy going to an event without drinking and still have a good time AND you decide to hold another event at the same time with drinking, it shows a huge lack of support and empathy for your friend. Also you may have a problem. Just drink afterwards! Lol.", "everyone\u2019s recovery is different and not everyone needs to or goes to AA. there are alternative programs that don\u2019t endorse or use a sponsorship format. additionally, 4 months for some people may be fine to be in \u201cwet environments\u201d depending on their own motivations and behavioural pattern while using. i have 0 issues or temptations when going to bars or are around others who are drinking, for example, but still don\u2019t allow alcohol in my home because i just don\u2019t want it there. like why would you introduce a temptation unnecessarily?", "You are very judgmental.", "OP isn\u2019t monitoring his use\u2014he requested a parameter regarding no booze in their home and she\u2019s sticking to it out of respect.", "The point is that the responsibility for recovery and his personal environment is HIS. Not hers.", "He brought up the conversation about not allowing alcohol into the house when he first stopped drinking. He is VERY good at communicating, and so am I. \nHe has not brought it up since. So I assumed the rule was still the same. \nThe reason he wants us to have cookouts is because he absolutely LOVES to cook, and he's really REALLY good at it, and he wants to have friends over for BBQs, cookouts, dinner, etc.\nI just didn't want to be the asshole for enforcing that boundary, but I would assume it's the same if he has not said anything or told me he has changed his mind.", "yes, and he took responsibility for that by requesting this in the 1st place and she\u2019s on board with it because she\u2019s supportive. they live together & it has to be a team effort. going out and being around people drinking is a different dynamic than a BYOB in one\u2019s home."]}
