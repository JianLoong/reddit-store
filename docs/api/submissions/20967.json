Same goes for the other roommate ... they took their chances living with a couple. Happens all of the time. Take care of yourself and move out.", "NTA, move on because this is not your problem. It's really rather audacious to break up with you and then expect you to help out financially. I wish you all the best.", "NTA. Your relationship has changed and consequences to that. One usually is separate living spaces. The fact they can't afford rent is no longer your concern unless on lease and liable. They can find new roommate and if you were bed/room sharing due to being a couple, then bit of a given you'd be leaving. Sharing a bed with your ex isn't good for anyone", "NTA get tf out.
