We're in our third year of uni.\n\nWe hang out sometimes outside of uni with other friends but I wouldn't say me and Casey are close. \n\nRecently, Casey has been talking to me a lot more and making efforts to try to spend time with me. At first I thought Casey was interested in me and subtly reminded her that I have a girlfriend, but it turns out that Casey is a lesbian.\n\nAnyway, Casey has been talking to me a lot out of nowhere. She frequently vents to me about her problems which I don't mind but it is almost everyday. \n\nCasey has also been asking me to do tasks for her like calling customer service numbers for her because she's \"too shy\" to do it herself, accompanying her to doctor's appointments or moving furniture in her apartment. I'm not very good at telling people no and I thought I was doing a good deed by helping her out, but she never talks to me unless she wants to vent or to ask me to help her with stuff and it's becoming draining.\n\nA few days ago, Casey called me to ask me if I could accompany her to the orthodontist as she's getting her braces tightened. I told her that I couldn't as I had a date with my girlfriend on that day. \n\nCasey implied that I should cancel the date, and I firmly told her I wasn't going to, but I hope her appointment goes well. She started talking in a baby voice and begging me to go with her, and going on about how she's scared of the dentist. I told her no again. \n\nShe started yelling at me and said I'm a garbage friend. I kind of lost my patience and yelled back at her and told her to \"grow the fuck up and stop acting like a toddler\". Casey went silent for a few seconds then hung up the phone, and she's blocked me on everything and has been telling all our classmates that I'm a 'nice guy'.", "created_utc": 1667988995, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yqemp6/aita_for_telling_my_friend_to_grow_up_and_stop/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You aren\u2019t her dad, boyfriend, brother, or cousin. She needs to grow up and/or seek support elsewhere. She has been using you for a long time, and the first time you said no she showed her true colors.", "NTA.   Do you really think that Casey is/was a friend?  She was using you.  As soon as she realized you weren't there to be used, she dumped you.   IMO you will find that life without Casey is much better than life with Casey.", "NTA. It's way too soon into this friendship for you to be helping her move. And if she's not listening to you or asking how you are, she's looking for a parent, not a friend. Being a grown up is awful but we all have to do it. If she wants people to bring her places, she needs to get a girlfriend. Or call a friend she's known for longer than five minutes!", "NTA - She's using you and couldn't cope the first time you said no. Alone the suggestion you should cancel a date with your SO so you can accompany her to the dentist is wild.\n\nI suggest you reevaluate this friendship. If she only comes to you when she needs help or someone to vent that would be way to one-sided for me.", "NTA. This isn't normal behaviour and it sounds like she's been treating you like more of a parent than a friend. If you can, please try to get her to go to therapy.", "NTA she\u2019s a manipulative and a user. I\u2019d call her out on her lies about you as well to your classmates.", "NTA. It sounds like Casey needs to grow up. There is nothing wrong with wanting moral support to go to an appointment but she shouldn\u2019t scream at you if you can\u2019t go.  You set a boundary in your relationship with her and she lost it and that isn\u2019t okay.", "NTA. Maybe your response could have been kinder and Casey is going through something if her behavior is a recent change, but you have every right to stick to your own schedule. It doesn't make you a bad friend if you don't ditch every plan you have to accommodate someone else.", "NTA whatsoever. \nGlad you put your foot down and set a boundary. For the sake of yourself your relation with your girlfriend. \nNo matter if she is genuinely an anxious person or someone who can barely get by without someone, no means no and she could go find medical help if it\u2019s that bad.", "Good you ask for a second opinion. NTA. \n\nShe sounds really exhausting, and who would ask a friend to cancel a date for something like that?", "NTA. She did you a favor by completely overreacting. Keep her blocked. It's icky when grown adults act like they can't function without someone to coddle them. You are not her butler, her concierge, her personal assistant, nor her emotional support dog.  Her overreaction is an attempt to emotionally manipulate you because this has worked for her in the past.", "NTA-", "NTA. You've done nothing wrong here.", "You are surely not the ass", "NTA\n\nA friendship requires give and take. Yall aren't friends.", "NTA I think think she was jealous of your girlfriend as most female bestfriend get as they think she might lose you but that doesn't justify her behavior and he has no authority over you nor do you have the obligation to listen to her outlandish requi she has no say in your relationship still you should go to her apologies for yelling at her and sit down and have a conversation with her afterwards", "NTA. She sounds like a stressful person to have in your life. You said no and she didn't respect it. Hopefully she'll stop asking you to do everything for her now", "NTA.\n\nSomething I've learnt is that the most evil thing is a nice person who says no. If you are an asshole and you say no, nobody cares, because you're an asshole. But if you are nice and say no... Hooo boy, what an evil bastard.\n\nAlso, you learn who someone is when you say no.\n\nJust remember that.", "NTA she sounds draining, good on you for standing up to her", "NTA and you learned a lesson I hope. Help some, wait for reciprocation and if they don't move on. Never give more than you can afford and still keep yourself safe and happy.\n\nShe was never your friend tbh, she just wanted someone to do everything for her and she found herself a slave. She could get you to do anything and you were a good guy to her till she couldn't then your are trash and to be discarded. I'd put a link to this post in every chat or hand it to folks in class if they have questions.", "NTA\n\nIf her anxiety is so bad she can't make a phone call or go to the dentist by herself, she needs to see a professional. It's not your responsibility to be her therapist or emotional support human.\n\nAlso, learn to say no. Or this will always be your life.", "Well hopefully your peers see her for what she is.

She would barge into my dorm room unannounced just to vent about whatever. But if I vent to her, she'd make it about her and talk over me everytime. I told her time and time again that she has so many friends, why does it have to be the introverted one she clings on to. I even made it clear that I'm not lonely and I need to have time alone and that she's got to stop coming to my room unannounced. But she never listened. So for the sake of my sanity, I just went LC and didn't care whatever she thought about it. NTA", "NTA. You really aren\u2019t the AH here, even though you were rude. You\u2019re allowed to have boundaries. You\u2019re allowed to be put off by someone trying to latch on and leech off of you. You can tell the friends who Casey\u2019s gossiping to that you don\u2019t care what she calls you, and that it\u2019s because you held your boundaries. That kind of thing is the opposite of what a fake \u201cnice guy\u201d does, so that will let them know it\u2019s false.", "ESH Casey needs to sort out the self-entitlement. It sounds like girl has anxiety and appreciated your moral support with things and wants to make you a friend, I think you could be more understanding with that. \n\nShe was being annoying but you were too harsh. If you want to save the friendship you had then you should communicate clearly and calmly that you feel the relationship is one-sided, she only contacts you when she needs a favour and you feel she doesn\u2019t make an effort to give anything back (like asking how you are, doing you favours, making sure you know you\u2019re valued)", "ESH for a very simple reason. Being bad at saying no also makes you one of the people acting like a child. You blew up on her for something she presumably had no idea you disliked because you were always willing to do it before because you were not grown up enough to tell her that you didn't. That makes you suck too. She sucks for being a user. You suck for lacking a spine.", "NTA\n\nI've been struggling to decide between e-s-h and NTA, but I've decided to go with the latter. I think that while you were not particularly kind to Casey, I can understand where it came from. She's the one who escalated this by yelling at you and accusing you of being a 'garbage friend' simply for saying 'no' to her. I'd like to think that I'd be calm in this situation, but I've never experienced being screamed at and accused of being a bad friend when I've been quite the opposite, so I can't really blame you for how you reacted in the moment.\n\nFrom what you've said, it's pretty clear that she has a poor understanding of other people's boundaries and might have some attachment issues, too. While that might explain her behaviour, it doesn't excuse it and doesn't mean you should put up with it. I would keep her at arm's length from now on, because she isn't your friend, and try to manage the fall-out of her accusations as best you can. Hopefully your classmates are astute enough to recognise the kind of person she is and will take her with a pinch of salt.\n\nHowever, struggling to say 'no' to people will more than likely land you in uncomfortable situations like this again and this build-up of frustration is a side-effect of not speaking up sooner. Take it from someone who was like you: laying down boundaries and saying 'no' to people like this early on will help you no end.", "You should have set boundaries with her a long time ago so I would say E S H but she was worse so NTA.
