I'd like to think that I'd be calm in this situation, but I've never experienced being screamed at and accused of being a bad friend when I've been quite the opposite, so I can't really blame you for how you reacted in the moment.\n\nFrom what you've said, it's pretty clear that she has a poor understanding of other people's boundaries and might have some attachment issues, too. While that might explain her behaviour, it doesn't excuse it and doesn't mean you should put up with it.

I would make sure your friend group know what went down before she tries to spread a false narrative.", "NTA. I had someone who talked to me only to vent, and wasn't prepared to return the favor. One time I had to ask her if we could talk later because I was trying to work, and she gave me the silent treatment for about two days. It was such a relief to escape her that I saw no reason not to let the silent treatment go on indefinitely. She just found another person to latch onto.", "NTA\n\nBut Casey sounds like she\u2019s dealing with some intense social anxiety. You are NOT responsible for managing that. She needs to seek out therapy. If this is hampering her day to day ability to function, I would consider reaching out to one of your school counselors and explaining the concern for her mental health to see if they can work with her. I\u2019m not sure if your campus offers it but when I was in college our campus had mental health counselors on staff free of charge to the students. If someone expressed concern about another student, they operated similar to social workers in reaching out and trying to assist or (in cases where a student\u2019s safety was a concern) evaluating if a student needed more involved medical care. \n\nWith social anxiety it can be very hard for someone to seek out the treatment themselves. Often times that person will need a friend/family/partner to intervene and make the appointment or be approached by a medical professional after someone reports a concern in order to begin treatment.", "NTA, but Casey is manipulative as anything. First she asks you for a favor of your time for the hundred and something time, then when you say No she starts begging in a baby voice, then when you stand firm she starts yelling, and when that doesn't work she cuts you off.  \nWell, my 1 1/2 year old granddaughter behaves almost exactly that way. Except that when she sees that yelling won't work, she capitulates and settles for what she can get. But then, my granddaughter is a lot smarter than Casey", "It's way too soon into this friendship for you to be helping her move.

It's sad but it's absolutely not your fault, not your responsibility, and not helping her at all to cave in to her demands. \n\nIn the end she really does need to grow up, and get help.
