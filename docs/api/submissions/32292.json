If I catch them they have to say \"I sir, am a wiggly worm sir. And a wiggly worm sir, is the lowest form of life\". It's from an old tv show I watched as a kid.  \n\nWell this has put a bug up my sister-in-law's butt.  She says that I am being an asshole making my kids call themselves names. \n\nFor the record when they chase me, and I let them catch me, I also have to say it. \n\nShe says I'm harming their delicate psyches and that old people like me have no idea the harm we are doing. \n\nMy wife knows about the game and she plays too. She has no problem with it. But her sister really seems to take this seriously.
