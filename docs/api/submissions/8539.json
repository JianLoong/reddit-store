He\u2019ll spend hundreds on old sets or custom jobs. There have been times where I thought it was probably irresponsible of him and that he should put money in savings instead, because it\u2019s what I would do. However he always has his bills paid, puts a percent in savings/retirement, and his spending on legos decreases dramatically during times of financial cutbacks. So, I totally support him because it\u2019s at what I consider a healthy level for a hobby, albeit an expensive one. But if he wasn\u2019t paying bills or hitting our agreed-upon savings goals I\u2019d be less supportive. \n\nIn terms of the documentary\u2026 if you\u2019re not interested you\u2019re not interested.

Not to be that person who says \"you had one disagreement so you should get divorced immediately\" but if you're this upset about one particular hobby of his, it might be time to reflect on the nature of your relationship. If you really do care about him you should work on being able to put your own interest aside in order to allow him to enjoy something with his partner. Demeaning him because you think his hobby is akin to a mental disorder won't do anything but cause problems. \n\nSide note: it's possible your husband is on the autism spectrum and this has been his special interest for the past four years.
