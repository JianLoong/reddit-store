My SO is a Lego-fiend. Like we have a room in our house for them. The sets are very expensive. But he loves them and they\u2019re his way to relax and destress. He\u2019ll spend hundreds on old sets or custom jobs. There have been times where I thought it was probably irresponsible of him and that he should put money in savings instead, because it\u2019s what I would do. However he always has his bills paid, puts a percent in savings/retirement, and his spending on legos decreases dramatically during times of financial cutbacks. So, I totally support him because it\u2019s at what I consider a healthy level for a hobby, albeit an expensive one. But if he wasn\u2019t paying bills or hitting our agreed-upon savings goals I\u2019d be less supportive. \n\nIn terms of the documentary\u2026 if you\u2019re not interested you\u2019re not interested. However, there are way nicer ways to say it. You should probably apologize for that. If you genuinely do think collecting toys is immature and a disease, you\u2019re not compatible. It\u2019s obviously a passion for him and he\u2019s not going to change. It will lead to resentment if you really think like this.", "ESH\n\nHim spending his entire income on one of his purchases is crazy. Once you're married there are definitely things you should talk about with your significant other when it comes to finances, at least that's what I think.\n\nBut man, harsh to tell your husband that you have zero genuine interest in his own hobbies and what makes him happy, especially since he goes out of his way to try and include someone he loves into an activity that he genuinely enjoys.\n\nBut man, harsh to tell your husband that you have zero genuine interest in his own hobbies and what makes him happy, especially since he goes out of his way to try and include someone he loves in an activity that he genuinely enjoys.", "I was about to comment saying you were a bit harsh here ... until I had a look at your previous post about this. NTA 100% this has to stop and I would have walked away a long time ago. Sometimes people need a very harsh reality check.", "ESH.  You both seem immature about this. He needs to put other things before his hobby.  You need some tact.", "NTA. Is your husband autistic? I am and learning when it\u2019s appropriate to talk about your special interest and when isn\u2019t is an important skill to develop. My spouse will tell me if I\u2019m sharing too much, but also sometimes asks me questions and wants to engage if they\u2019re in the mood and want to connect. I likewise try to ask them about their interests even if I don\u2019t always care, because it\u2019s a nice way to learn about each other & build a connection.", "It's a really dope documentary by the way", "NTA. Hubby knows you do not like his hobby on toy collecting, especially since he has spent too much money on toys in the recent past. You come home from work exhausted and he is excited about something toy related. You listen for a half hour and then say you aren't interested and that you will watch if he really wants you to but you think this is more than a hobby at this point. Something that may be serious.\n\nThen he accuses you of being negative and not supportive. \n\nYou listened for 30 minutes, probably half the length of the show. When he didn't slow down you were tactless, but honest. This is a person who is spending money he can't afford to spend and is still getting hyped up about his hobby.\n\nHubby and I both have significant toy collections. We probably have too many. But we don't spend all our money on it. And we don't go talking for a half hour with someone we know has no interest. Plus, does he collect pez dispensers? We have  couple, but not our thing. To be that excited about them would take effort on either of our parts.\n\nLook,maybe you could have been nicer, but you aren't  TA", "you couldve stopped at \"no\" without insulting everything he likes, and who he is as a person OP\n\nbut you didnt stop there.\n\nYTA", "You are non-interested, OK. At that moment you were tired, OK. But that is no reason to attack his passion as being not worthy of your, anybody's, time and money? You could have just said that you were too tired, and therefore could not appreciate it at the moment? \"Record it, so I can watch it later\". That would be a very reasonable excuse to not watch it now (and maybe never). But instead - you called him an addict and/or hoarder.

It sounds like you believe it\u2019s an addiction *for him* due to his past choices.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. It sounds like these toys mean a lot to him though. Could he be autistic? Telling someone to their face you think they have a disease like addiction or hoarding is not the way to go and very nearly made my answer different, but it's also not reasonable for him to get annoyed because you won't watch a documentary. Perhaps you can find a time when you're both relaxed to have a discussion around this.", "NTA.. because you did not want to watch the documentary.\n\nBut a gigantic AH for your childish reaction and what you said to your husband.", "YTA for gods sake you described his passion as a disease you could've just said no", "YTA. Not to be that person who says \"you had one disagreement so you should get divorced immediately\" but if you're this upset about one particular hobby of his, it might be time to reflect on the nature of your relationship. If you really do care about him you should work on being able to put your own interest aside in order to allow him to enjoy something with his partner. Demeaning him because you think his hobby is akin to a mental disorder won't do anything but cause problems. \n\nSide note: it's possible your husband is on the autism spectrum and this has been his special interest for the past four years. You can encourage him not to spend money on this hobby recklessly but this is clearly what he's interested in right now.\n\nAll that said, if you're normal human beings you will probably be feeling fine again in a day or two.

Very rude and immature.\n\nI am wondering do you collect something, that's even more expensive, like shoes or bags?

I did apologize and I felt bad, but I am resentful.", "I feel like sometimes people really don't put themselves in other peoples shoes.

I'm just so resentful that I am so mean now.\n\nLiterally he mentions toys and my whole demeanor changes.", "Thank you. Literally made me cry because I feel like such an A. I know I should have had more finesse  when adressing his hobby. He even has his own room for them.  I was supportive at first, but now I down right want to hurl the moment there is a mention of toys.  It has just cause so many fights.  Even when I was laid off due to covid.  He was just spending away.  While I was looking for help anywhere I could find it.  I don't see how I am supposed to find the energy to support his hobby.

I do think I was the A tho", ">it's also not reasonable for him to get annoyed because you won't watch a documentary\n\nMaybe I'm projecting, but I kind of get the sense that OP has been dismissive of his hobby in the past, and that he feels unsupported in general, not just in this particular instance. Which, you know, if he's blown a substantial portion of their income on toys in the past, it's understandable that OP would feel some resentment towards that hobby! ...but I also have some really formative memories of my parents mocking my special interests, and I find it really difficult to openly show excitement around other people as a result.\n\nI think there's probably some resentment that's been building on both sides, and you're absolutely right, they need to sit down and have a discussion.", "The problem comes that he does spend money recklessly and has for 4 years.  He has been not as bad the last few months but only because I threatened to  stop paying his car and let them repo it.

Expect another one when you get divorce papers soon.", "These conversations and boundaries have been had and set multiple times over the last year.  He knows this is my final year.

If you\u2019d told him you were exhausted from work after a few minutes or so, it likely wouldn\u2019t have escalated so much. Plenty of people would snap and hurt someone\u2019s feelings after getting badgered for half an hour! There\u2019s nothing wrong or inherently unsupportive with setting up and enforcing boundaries for yourself.

He's also threatened to spend money they don't have on a new toy drop and put it on their credit card if OP didn't somehow make the finances work and give him the money for it out of her bank account. \n\nI can't blame her for being dismissive of it or treating it like an addiction, because it is one and tbh, he's leaning really hard into financial abuse territory over it.", "Good.
