It's been 8 years since then. My boyfriend (36, let's call him B) happened to see a picture of me wearing the dress and he thought it looked super hot.\n\nHere's the thing: Today I hate how the dress looks. I hate the color, and I think it looks cheap. However, he absolutely wants me to wear it for sexy time. In the past, I've told him no several times, but whenever he's in the mood, he keeps bringing the topic up again. \n\nSo one time I put it on anyway because I was sick of having these types of discussions all the time. But it made me feel so cheap and also somehow humiliated that I started crying in front of him. He said he would never want me to wear something like that if it made me feel so bad, and I was hopeful that this would be the end of it. And he said \"but thanks for trying to make me happy, I appreciate it.\"\n\nCue the next time he's in the mood, he brings up this fucking dress again. I must admit, this time I got pretty upset and raised my voice and yelled at him that I'm done with this topic. I got up, ripped the dress out of my closet, threw it in the trash, and threw the trash into the container outside my apartment.\n\nB. now keeps saying that I overreacted, he's upset at me for having raised my voice because now the neighbors probably heard it, and he said I could have just said no and that would have been the end of it.
