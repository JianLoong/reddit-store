I told her no.  I know that she doesn't like dogs and I felt like she was trying to control me in my house.  She was complaining that she and her boyfriend were getting sniffed and licked.  I do know my dogs are friendly like that and I did hear from someone else they got licked.  I still didn't want to put them away.  This is their house too. Well, her and her boyfriend ended up leaving early.  I told that it was rude to leave early and she responded with its rude to not put your dogs away.

He's convinced everybody is his new best friend and wants to show them how much he loves them. Which is amazing progress I don't want to undo as when I got him he was a former stray and afraid of people (which he had good reason for). Still there are people who are afraid of him. Some come around, there are some children in our neighbourhood that are afraid of dogs and when they saw him interact with the other children they crept nearer. He ignored them until they were right next to him, then he casually leaned against them while still giving his attention to other people and when the anxious children were well into petting and hugging him he slowly gave them small and deliberate doses of friendly attention. This happened while I had him on leash and was carefully checking the children were safe and happy and on their own accord (they tend to come near over time when their  friends abandon their play for a long time - my dog is the best friend of all the dog loving neighbourhood children). Whenever we meet someone in the streets I ask if they're afraid of dogs. If so we cross the street. My dog has a command that reminds him he needs to wait for people making the first step before approaching them and is always on leash (outside of town dogs can go off leash) because he once approached a dog that's afraid of other dogs when off leash. Inside my home it's simple: people who don't want to interact with him are not welcome to stay longer than nessecary and as long as they're there doggo is in his favourite room with the door closed. Maybe I could train him to not approach people at home but he's 13, spent only 4 of those years living with humans and the people I'm close enough to to want them in my home are his best friends. So this is our solution. If I had a friend afraid of dogs I'd look for a solution better suited to that situation.

Therefore even if my best friend was afraid of him or hated dogs I couldn't have just locked doggo up for long periods of time for my own pleasure. Those are things I meditated over a lot before getting a dog and the reasony requirements were lazyness (as when I'm ill I couldn't fulfill a Husky's needs) and no aggression whatsoever. Because even though it wasn't to be expected that my dog turns me into his personal God (I rarely met a dog so bonded to a human as he's to me. He stays alone without a fuss and sleeps but when I'm not there and one of his favourite humans comes over he ignores them while he throws a party for them if I'm home) it was absolutely clear that I can't regularly leave my dog alone or lock him up for my social needs.

Therefore I need to respect their preference not to interact with my dog and since my dog isn't one to be 100% sure to ignore guests in his home on command I would separate them. If they're open to getting used to the dog I'll facilitate that (a friend of mine was shy around dogs but interested in my boy. Doggo and I made sure to give her an introduction on her terms and after a few months they became inseparable friends and she feels as comfortable with him as an experienced dog trainer) but if not I'll respect that.
