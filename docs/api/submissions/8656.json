I told her no.  I know that she doesn't like dogs and I felt like she was trying to control me in my house.  She was complaining that she and her boyfriend were getting sniffed and licked.  I do know my dogs are friendly like that and I did hear from someone else they got licked.  I still didn't want to put them away.  This is their house too. Well, her and her boyfriend ended up leaving early.  I told that it was rude to leave early and she responded with its rude to not put your dogs away.

He doesn\u2019t lick or bother my guest unless they go over to them. I also make sure to know that if they want to greet him let me know.

If they were licking strangers on the streets i might call them untrained, but in their own home, naaah.", "people don\u2019t normally waste time training dogs not to lick people since it\u2019s harmless", "Were they though?", "Yeah. If i go to someone\u2019s home and the dogs are around and lick me, I remove myself. I don\u2019t ask my hosts to put their dogs in another room. And believe me, I really don\u2019t like dogs. Especially dogs that lick. Blergh.", "I love dogs. But im sorry, if you are hosting a party and your dog/s are not behaving that should be addressed.", "I would disagree. I think it\u2019s completely fair for someone to ask if it\u2019s possible for the dogs to be put away, especially because it\u2019s only for a short period of time. If they were mean or rude about asking it, then it would be a different issue. However, because it seems as though it was a genuine polite request (seeing as other people at the party were ALSO being licked, are the dogs even trained?), it wouldn\u2019t necessarily make them an ah. When their request was denied, they left. That seems fair to me.", "Well, that depends on the host and the guest. OP calls it their dogs being \u201cfriendly\u201d. I have friends who would be incredibly offended if i went to their home and asked them to hide their dogs because they\u2019re licking me. So as a guest I walk away from the dogs. Trying to keep the peace and the friendship."]}
