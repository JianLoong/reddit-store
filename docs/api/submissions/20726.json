She wanted me to play it but I initially declined since I'm not into visual novels or reading long stories but after she begged, I gave it a try and played for a good 15 mins. Now I can tell she put in a lot of effort in the writing and the art and it was a good start but I just got tired of reading and stopped. She asked what I thought and wanted me to eventually finish it and tell her what I thought about the choices and the endings but I told her I had no plans to. She looked shocked and asked if it was boring, I told her no, it's just that I'm just not into this type of genre and she knows im not into reading but asked me to make an exception this time since she made it. I got upset because I think she is being childish and wants to blackmail me into doing something I don't want. After I made it clear I wasn't continuing, she hasn't talked to me. I already know that she is talented and smart so just because I don't want to play it doesn't mean I dont support her. Some of my friends agree she's being immature but others think I should be more supportive.

Of a genre that isn't in his interests.\n\nI've been a game designer, tabletop games, but, still.  Game I worked on was just released if you need proof.  \n\nPlaytesting is tedious, even when it's your own work.  You aren't just playing, you are actually working, essentially bug hunting, trouble shooting.  It's a lot of work.  \n\nI don't expect friends and family to be my test audience - the test audience is people with an actual interest in the genre.\n\nAll of you giving him crap -tell me, if your partner designed teh next 40k, and wanted you to seriously play it and give feedback, would you?   I highly doubt it.", "NTA, but you should break up with her and date someone you respect and value.  \n\nIf you can't motivate yourself into supporting her by engaging for a few hours with something she has worked on for 2 years, even if you don't like it, you don't really respect or value her.  \n\nUnless it's on the level of neo-nazi fandom or similar, you should have felt excited by this simply because it's something she made.

It would be nice of you to power through the game to give genuine critique but you shouldn't be forced to continue if it's not your cup of tea. People in a relationship can have different interests.\n\nLet's practice the AITA classic: gender-flip this post, with him making an ARPG. She doesn't like clicking, twitch reactions and loud sounds. GF makes it known beforehand, tries for 15 minutes and comes back with her aforementioned list of grievances and stops playing. If that doesn't sound problematic then this scenario is no different.\n\nYou should probably reassure your girlfriend that the portions you did play were good, though. Restate that the art/writing is well done and maybe she'll see that you're not disregarding her work but are genuinely disinterested in the genre.", "Definitely NTA \n\nThis is one of those examples where if it was a girl saying her boyfriend wanted her to play a game he made that she wasn't interested in, everyone would be on her side.\n\nOP gave it a chance, he wasn't interested. He just doesn't like that style of gameplay. He shouldn't be pressured into doing something he doesn't want to, especially after he already gave it a chance. And as his partner, his gf should respect that. It's not an insult towards her game at all. He complimented her game multiple times and reassured her. \n\nWouldn't it be best for her as well to get a playtester that was genuinely interested in that style of game play? \n\nIt's like when my parents forced me to eat meals that I just didn't simply like the taste of. I appreciate the effort that went into cooking, it looks and smells nice, I took bites to see if I liked it. I just happened to not like it.

Your specific taste in games should play no role in this scenario, because she created something and is asking for your support in that creation.\n\nShe's worked on this thing for 2 years, and you gave it 15 minutes of your time.

But by choosing not to finish and pushing back so hard, you SHOWED her that you don't actually support her. \n\nI've played hundreds of hours of stupid fucking video games because I knew it'd make my guy happy.

Jesus christ, you can't do ONE thing for somebody? Somebody you love?", "YTA. How exactly do you support her? I reckon the game wouldn't last a whole day. It would just be a few hours max. to see what she spent a freaking year creating. I bet you spend more than good 15 minutes reading subs here in reddit, so why not trying to do this for her?", "YTA. You\u2019re being 100% selfish. She\u2019s asking you for help critiquing the game she created. As her SO, why can\u2019t you just play it to the end and not act like it\u2019s boring?

As someone who ~~wasted my time~~ got a degree in game programming, I can guess how much work and effort the GF put into making her game and I respect the fact that she finished it. This is just a situation of \"Knowing your audience\".\n\nOp mentioned that her game isn't his type of genre he enjoys playing but she really wanted feedback from someone close to her. As long as Op wasn't being disrespectful, his feedback was still a positive to her work. Could Op put in more effort to finish the game, sure but that is like asking someone who dislikes horror movies to watch Nightmare on Elm Street to get their thoughts on the movie.
