She wanted me to play it but I initially declined since I'm not into visual novels or reading long stories but after she begged, I gave it a try and played for a good 15 mins. Now I can tell she put in a lot of effort in the writing and the art and it was a good start but I just got tired of reading and stopped. She asked what I thought and wanted me to eventually finish it and tell her what I thought about the choices and the endings but I told her I had no plans to. She looked shocked and asked if it was boring, I told her no, it's just that I'm just not into this type of genre and she knows im not into reading but asked me to make an exception this time since she made it. I got upset because I think she is being childish and wants to blackmail me into doing something I don't want. After I made it clear I wasn't continuing, she hasn't talked to me. I already know that she is talented and smart so just because I don't want to play it doesn't mean I dont support her. Some of my friends agree she's being immature but others think I should be more supportive.

Game I worked on was just released if you need proof.  \n\nPlaytesting is tedious, even when it's your own work.

It would be nice of you to power through the game to give genuine critique but you shouldn't be forced to continue if it's not your cup of tea. People in a relationship can have different interests.\n\nLet's practice the AITA classic: gender-flip this post, with him making an ARPG. She doesn't like clicking, twitch reactions and loud sounds. GF makes it known beforehand, tries for 15 minutes and comes back with her aforementioned list of grievances and stops playing. If that doesn't sound problematic then this scenario is no different.\n\nYou should probably reassure your girlfriend that the portions you did play were good, though. Restate that the art/writing is well done and maybe she'll see that you're not disregarding her work but are genuinely disinterested in the genre.", "[deleted]", "lol damn bro u coulda just played it for like 30 mins or hour for her and never play it again yta sorry", "YTA. Fair enough it's not really your thing but she's been working on this for two years you can't suck it up for like 2 hours to get through it and give her feedback? *You* are the one being childish here, she's asking you, as her partner, to have the tiniest part in an incredibly important part of her life and you can't suck it up and do it because it's not your favorite thing in the world. You're being selfish and I don't blame her for being mad at you.", "YTA. Your preferences do not matter in this situation, because what she's asking isn't damaging to either of you. In order to be a good partner, you have to be supportive unconditionally to your partner. Your specific taste in games should play no role in this scenario, because she created something and is asking for your support in that creation.\n\nShe's worked on this thing for 2 years, and you gave it 15 minutes of your time.

Fine, you aren't interested in the genre or subject matter, but I assume you ARE interested in your girlfriend, right? If so, play the dang game!

Someone\u2019s immature here, but it isn\u2019t your girlfriend", "YTA dude, do you even like your gf?\n\nShe spent YEARS creating something and was hoping you could put aside your 'preference' to check out what she's been pouring herself into and give her feedback.\n\nI'm not into computers or video games At All...but my husband spent a while building his computer by hand.

FFS dude you can at least Pretend to support her \n\n>wants to blackmail me into doing something I don't want\n\nDo you even know what blackmail is? She ASKED you to do this thing in support of her. That's not blackmail. That's a gf being hopeful and asking something of her partner.\n\n>After I made it clear I wasn't continuing, she hasn't talked to me\n\nBecause she understands how much you care now... which isn't much based off this post.\n\n>I already know that she is talented and smart so just because I don't want to play it doesn't mean I dont support her\n\nYOU think this. But by choosing not to finish and pushing back so hard, you SHOWED her that you don't actually support her. \n\nI've played hundreds of hours of stupid fucking video games because I knew it'd make my guy happy. He knows I hate them so he understands what it means when I do. Because we are different people with different interests but know how important showing support is.", "YTA. Jesus christ, you can't do ONE thing for somebody? Somebody you love?", "YTA. How exactly do you support her? I reckon the game wouldn't last a whole day. It would just be a few hours max. to see what she spent a freaking year creating. I bet you spend more than good 15 minutes reading subs here in reddit, so why not trying to do this for her?", "YTA. You\u2019re being 100% selfish. She\u2019s asking you for help critiquing the game she created. As her SO, why can\u2019t you just play it to the end and not act like it\u2019s boring?

Reading this I could already tell what responses this post would get but let me throw in my 2 cents. As someone who ~~wasted my time~~ got a degree in game programming, I can guess how much work and effort the GF put into making her game and I respect the fact that she finished it. This is just a situation of \"Knowing your audience\".\n\nOp mentioned that her game isn't his type of genre he enjoys playing but she really wanted feedback from someone close to her. As long as Op wasn't being disrespectful, his feedback was still a positive to her work. Could Op put in more effort to finish the game, sure but that is like asking someone who dislikes horror movies to watch Nightmare on Elm Street to get their thoughts on the movie. It would just get that person to give a harsher feedback for doing something they didn't want to do. \n\nPersonally I would of took 15min feedback and look around my family/friend groups to find someone who appreciate my games genre more.", "NTA how many times does he need to say NOT INTERESTED and be left alone?", "You sound like a 5 year old lol YTA suck it up", "\"I spent a good 15 minutes of my precious 1440 minutes of today and 10080 minutes allocated to me this week to support you! what else do you want????
