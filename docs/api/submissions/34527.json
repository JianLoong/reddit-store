They can go a week without. However if you wanted a compromise why not bring a tablet or something, just buy it for the 1 device. Then they can have an hour a day each or something.", "NTA. I took my family on a cruise and we did NOT buy the Internet option. There's so much to do and it's nice to unplug. For the adults with work stuff you can check your email when you're in port.", "NTA\n\n They're 11 and 14. They won't die if they miss instagram posts. \n\n>I talked to my mother and brother and both of them are saying I should get the Package\n\nThen tell them to pay for it.", "Not a snowballs chance in hell that I would get them Internet at that price.", "Contrary to popular belief, unplugging from social media for seven days does NOT result in death.", "NTA. Can you get internet for 1 device and let them share. 1 hour a day. Surely the point of the trip is to do things anyway. If they find things boring without internet they may as well stay at home.", "NTA - I\u2019m sorry they\u2019re literally 12-14? A week without internet what would they possibly miss out when they\u2019re cruising the pacific? If anything getting them internet they\u2019ll miss out on the cruise experience. I went on a cruise at 17 and was happy to be without internet if it meant being on the cruise\u2026 \n\nYou\u2019re the parent here you\u2019re literally in charge. They can fuss and they can get over it. Pls don\u2019t let us millennials have a bad rap bc you\u2019re too scared to tell your kids no and shove out nearly $600 for internet\u2026", "NTA but I understand why they\u2019re panicking over it. They\u2019ll have internet when you dock at ports and if it gets bad, you can buy the package on the cruise. They\u2019ll be so busy they\u2019ll eventually forget. They\u2019ll be able to upload their lil stories while docked tho, whether they get off the ship or not. Don\u2019t get the package it\u2019s a rip off indeed!", "NTA. It's seven days. Your kids will be fine.", "OMG NTA. Do NOT get them internet. If they\u2019re this addicted then they need a break. They can survive a week without Instagram. I think they clearly need limited internet access in general because they can\u2019t seem to survive without it.", "In my experience, internet/wifi on cruise ships is notoriously slow. You\u2019re paying a premium for an inferior service. A week without internet is not a tragedy no matter what your kids tell you.", "I'm going with NAH because it's not wrong for the children to want internet and it's not that outrageous to deny them internet for 7 days. It's really up to your parenting style.\n\nThat said - is there no way to share a single connection, reducing the cost to $140? If only one person can be online at a time, that also encourages the others to see what the ship has to offer. Alternatively, another compromise could be allowing everyone internet but only on the weekend or similar time-frame that isn't the entire 7 days. \n\nYou could even turn it into a game like say, whoever does the best at some ship activity today gets to have internet the rest of the day / tomorrow.", "NTA.  You paid for a cruise and then they want you to pay more so your kids can sit on their phones the whole damn time?  Nah.  Disconnecting for a week will not kill them.  People love to talk about drug addiction with such scorn but being addicted to your phone and socials is somehow totally acceptable.  Alternatively, you tell the kids they can pony up and pay for it themselves with their savings.  Don\u2019t have the money?  No wifi.  They are already getting an awesome free vacation.  You do not need to pay an exorbitant amount of money for this trip just so they can eff around online the whole time.", "NTA. Harm them socially? How about they go find some friends to play with. Think about how much they will miss out on perusing tik tok.", "Nta you are the adult so it's ok to say no to your kids", "You can download a lot of content on your devices before you get onboard. That way they can have movies and books. NTA.", "Yikes, don\u2019t get it \n\nRead the semi famous book \u201cthe coddling of the American mind\u201d, social media is harmful particularly for young girls, They don\u2019t need it on a vacation.\n\nMaybe you could consider getting it on one day only (don\u2019t weakly cave when They inevitably ask for more days) you could pick a day in the middle if you aren\u2019t at a port and activities are limited\n\nThey 11 and 12 years olds should even have social media, there are phones text call etc with limited apps", "Really a waste of money and kind of illogical to pay for anyway. There's going to be plenty of things to do on the cruise and they shouldn't be that heavily reliant on the internet to have a good time anyway. No way would I pay for WiFi during a 7 day cruise in a beautiful place. They can still take their pictures and check in at ports. NTA", "Do the daughters have enough things to do without Internet? Books, some crafts, physical games, etc.? If the answer is no, I'd lean to E S H,  you guys should have thought about that in advance. If the answer is yes, then N T A.\n\nEdit: after your reply, NTA, OP, it'll do them well to explore other surroundings and activities.", "NTA. I've been on cruises and didn't bother getting the internet package for the same reason; the price. Granted, we didn't have kids. But they can live w/o the internet for a week. Of course, I am from a different generation; I went to camp in the summer, sometimes for as much as two weeks(!) and wouldn't contact anyone except thru letter. It's not like they'll be stuck in a jail cell, they'll be on a cruise, and there are plenty of things to do.\n\nMight be difficult though if you get to have internet. How come you get to have it and they can't? Maybe pay for one package and share  among you?\n\nEdit to add: others have been pointing out that they can prob get online when you are in port, which I hadn't considered. My last 7 day cruise, there were only 2 \"at sea\" days; all the other days we were in some port. So they could easily get online then.\n\nI don't know what activities your cruise offers, our last was the Disney cruise, they had all kinds of programs for kids. I'm sure your cruise will have some type of kids activities too. It's hard to be bored on a cruise; we had live shows, a movie theater, the pools, a sports deck, and various activities you could participate in. And that's not even considering activities available when you're in port.", "Not worth it and the perfect opportunity to do other things that do not necessitate internet access. NTA", "Nope. Actually this is a great opportunity for a detox.", "NTA, children need to learn how to be content without constant internet access and a cruise is a good place for that, plenty of stuff to do as a family. Also, What kind of cruise are you all going on exactly? \n\nA lot of family friendly cruise ships have clubs for children of the same age to hang out with during the day, play games and the like. I know Disney has them but that\u2019d be something worth checking out, keep the silly accusations of somehow \u201csocially isolating your children\u201d (despite a cruise being a collective family activity) at bay.", "NTA. You could do so much more with that money, like book an excursion.", "NTA- at that age, I bet they have a little money.  Tell them if they want it, they have to pay for it.  I use that on my niece and nephew all the time.   \n\nIf they don\u2019t have money, make them earn some with chore before the trip.", "NTA. They can social media when in port. It will be good for them to put down the phones.", "Take a deck of cards and other games. Internet will be available at docks.", "NTA - but you could consider a compromise and let them each have 2 days of their choosing.", "If you decide not to, there will likely be places with WiFi on port days such as restaurants, tourist information centres, etc. so they wouldn't be without it for the entire week. This is what we did when we went on a 10 day south Pacific cruise.", "A good teaching moment. I can't believe how young kids are allowed to be on the internet. The kids need to unplug and maybe discover the outside world. Good luck \ud83e\udd1e", "This is to stupid I would never even consider this. Their social life will not be ruined for a week away and you know what? A week without internet or social media will do them some good. YBTA if you got it.", "Info: have you tried posting in r/firstworldproblems", "If you give them a weekly or monthly allowance at home. Is it in option for them to put their allowance toward their internet package. So taking let\u2019s say $5 out of their allownace a week to pay for their internet so that it is not a hard hit all at once, if they want it that bad", "NTA. A cruise is already expensive and really should have wi-fi and internet access already included in the package. They'll survive a week without it, I'm sure the cruise has a ton of things that they can do like pools, live shows, activities etc.", "NTA. Balancing family time and disconnecting from digital devices can enhance the overall experience, allowing everyone to be present and fully enjoy the cruise activities. Standing firm on this decision is both reasonable and in the interest of fostering quality family time.", "NTA Internet at sea is awful and expensive they can find wifi in port if they are that desperate", "NTA, they can sit on the internet all day when they're at home.", "NTA. That\u2019s the beauty of having a cruise. \n\nIf you\u2019re pressured further though. Get WiFi for one device (a laptop) and make them share spending turns logging in and out of socials. Force the \u201cold days\u201d upon them \n\nAnd/or. Explain WHY internet is so expensive. It\u2019s a satellite signal.. to a boat\u2026 in the middle of the ocean. Ridiculous technology so that people can doom scroll in the middle of the sea. \n\nInternet on land costs much less because of all the existing infrastructure. Use it as an educational moment for everyone.", "NTA. But look up amenities and activities on the ship ahead of time to get a sense of whether they truly would likely be bored. If yes, ask them each to bring a couple things to entertain themselves that don't require internet. Obviously it would be different for different kids, but for mine it would be  things like downloaded audiobooks and podcasts, books, stuff for drawing, lego, a small board game.", "NTA. Don\u2019t do it. Since you and your wife agree, perfect. Kids are angry, whoopsies. We were angry a lot as kids, parents didn\u2019t oblige. You\u2019ve worked hard for this and it sounds like you\u2019ve got great plans. One week on a cruise ship without social media. Lots of lessons to be learned here by not getting it. If the kids want it, have them do $560 worth of chores BEFORE the trip.", "NTA. There's plenty for them to do on the cruise, they can take a break from the internet for a few days.   Also, they can check in with friends when you're in port.\n\nMy child is 19. We've cruised 3x with them as a teen and I've never bought the internet package.  It is expensive for scrappy service, and disconnecting for a few days is needed.", "NTA they can live for a week without TikTok and honestly if you get it they will be buried in their phones", "NTA, however I would give them the cost breakdowns of the wifi package and tell them that if it's that important to them they have plenty of time to earn some money to pay for it themselves. Otherwise, plan on enjoying the cruise experience.", "Your kids are not going to be socially deprived! Good grief. They can take a lot of photos and share them when they get back. They can buy little souveniers for their meat friends and share when they get back. They can write a journal and share when they get back (get them each a journal book to paste photos and write what happened each day.)\n\nThe cruise director knows how to keep kids entertained on a family cruise. Really.", "Can you get a refund on the kids' tickets? It sure sounds like they'd rather stay home and be plugged in. Why bother taking them? They sound ungrateful.", "NTA. \n\u201cWe\u201d didn\u2019t had wifi in our youth! And we all survived, during ~all those boring family gatherings~. \n\nTell them that if they really want WiFi they pay or do chores for it. \n\nWanna bet that they stop complaining!!", "INFO- How many days are at sea and how many are in port?\n\nThe more at sea days the more I'd be inclined to but the package, firstly because they'll use it more and secondly because you don't want them to spend every shore excursion glued to their phones because they are \"catching up\" after a couple of days offline.\n\nAlso there is a lot of reasons to want to be online other than social media.", "That's a complete ripoff, but consider how well your children do entertaining themselves without any internet.", "NTA. It's not worth it. \n\nI think what could be good is taking them to a bookstore and letting them each pick out a couple of books to read in their downtime on the ship.", "NTA. Less screen time, more reality time. This is a healthy way to have a vacation. They can take pictures and upload at home.", "NTA There is free WiFi at every port. There is so much to do on a cruise ship that they won\u2019t use it. I did get it last year on a cruise and it was terrible. You could barely get a signal anyways. I used WiFi in port to post pics to fb and text people back home.", "NTA\n\nAnd lets be real, you're gonna pay $560 for the worst internet you could possibly imagine. You'll have more than one moment of one of the kids or all of them whining about how slow it is or how they cant connect to something.", "NTA. Maybe get a single package for a universal device? Allow each person a day with it? Or set morning/afternoon use. That way they can \u201ccatch up\u201d on socials. \n\nOr yet buy one each day for a different person. Keep it fair.", "NTA. They'll be lots of places they can get free wifi on shore, just ask the crew where is good.\nMake sure devices have roaming data turned off so you don't get billed.\nA couple of things from my own experience... Some cruise lines have an app you can use with free wifi on board to get the schedule for the day as well as send messages to each other.\nThere are lots of things to do, even clubs for teens where they can hang out and make new friends.\n(Don't tell your kids, but if someone does get internet, they can hotspot their phone and share the connection with everyone.)", ">that my daughters would miss out a lot socially if I didn't\n\nLike what? Miss what?! What their friends are wearing everyday? What the influencers they follow are posting? What juicy gossip is happening in their friend groups,  like who is going steady with whom?\nI mean... come on. \nPerfectly opportunity to teach the lesson: there are places where internet is not guaranteed or necessary,  like on a cruise... in the pacific. \n\nThey could out their phones down, actually live and enjoy themselves in real time. Take lots of pictures, and post them afterwards. Are their followers going to unfollow them, if they don't post in real time?\n\nBrother and mother can pay for their package, if they are so concerned with your teenagers constant connection to the internet. \n\nNTA \nAnd if they go through with their threat to 'ruin the vacation', they can stay with their uncle / grandma next time,  and you can go more often with your wife and any kid that doesn't need to be connected all the time.", "560$ for Wi-Fi?!\n\nThat's one hell no! It's only for a week. They will survive.", ">my daughters would miss out a lot socially\n\nWhat absolute enabling bullshit. \n\nGet it for ONE day while sailing (not shore time) for each of them if you must. The little instant communication/screen addicts you've raised will be fine. Pack alternative forms of entertaining/stimulation (books (fiction/puzzle); downloaded movies; offline games). Plan activities (pure fun and educational).\n\nNTA. Show them what it looks like to engage the world around them.", "NTA. Although there have been improvements in recent years, cruise ship WiFi is NOT what your kids are used to. It\u2019s much slower. You can\u2019t watch TikTok or scroll endlessly through Instagram on cruise ship WiFi. If you do get it, they\u2019re going to be sorely disappointed.", "If your kids can\u2019t go a week without internet (and they\u2019d have it in the ports, so it\u2019s not completely being offline), leave them at home with mom and brother and you and your wife can enjoy the trip on your own.", "Let me give you a bit of advice. I went on a cruise when I was 13 and my sister was 11. The cut off age for the cool fun 'teen' area that had Arcade games was 13. My parents refused to allow me to go anywhere without my sister so we went to the kids area she was allowed in, but it was mostly for 5-6 year olds and incredibly boring.\n\nMy parents spent the cruise doing adult things and aside from getting off the ship my sister and I stayed in the cabin watching movies. I remember my dad complaining at us for not doing more, but there wasn't much we COULD do on our own.\n\nI think you really need to research what all is available and that your kids will genuinely enjoy. I have fond memories from that trip but it wasn't when my sister and I were alone I'll tell you that much lol.\n\nIs there any way you could have the kids save up the next few months for Internet on the trip? Or try to plan activities at the destinations together? Just a thought.", "NTA.\n\nThey can wait and do a photo dump when you get home.\n\nBesides, posting on social media things such as, \"I'm out of town/state/country for xxx amount of time\" is a bad idea anyway. It let's everyone know that no one is at home and invites burglary. \n\nPost photos when you return.", "They can go without it, that\u2019s a ridiculous price. It\u2019s not like they will totally cut off, it will be easy for them to find free wifi at all the ports. Maybe pick one night on a sea day to treat them. \n\nThey should be enjoying the experience not staring at their phones.", "Give them the option of working to pay for themselves, but I don\u2019t mean working for you or your wife. They can babysit. They can help neighbors, whatever they can come up with. But don\u2019t buy it for them. It goes against the whole reason of being on a cruise ship doesn\u2019t it? Who would want to be on a cruise ship and stuck glued to your phone? Not I. But that\u2019s just my opinion. NTA", "Make them buy it themselves. Great time to learn the vallue of things. Offer them small jobs etc its plenty of time away for them to save up enough then when cruise time comes ask them if theyre sure they want it for internet, spending money,  half it where they have internet every other day for each device and spending money, or do they want to share a device daily and still have spending money.", "NTA. they can survive without. Also - they can access social media when they are in each of the ports, so it\u2019s not like they\u2019ll be completely cut off. \n\nCruise ships have lots of activities on board for kids of all ages, so I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll have a good time. \n\nGiving them some time to get off social media is probably going to do them the world of good.", "NTA. But maybe give them the option of earning the money for it by doing chores or they can cut grass and rake leaves for neighbors for cash.", "NTA, But how about buying it just for one day, 2 or 3 days inn, and they can get their fix for one day.", "NTA. Maybe this isn't the right trip for the family though. If a cruise would be \"boring\" to them without their online addiction being satisfied, then a different trip, would be better. At least a land based trip would have cheaper data packages. Outside of a family vacation, I'd consider working on their ability to live IRL without getting \"bored.\"", "Could you just get internet on a single device and let them each have it for an hour?", "NTA, I think a week without outside communication is great if they\u2019re that tied to their friends. They will survive. \n\nOther option: though it\u2019s January so you\u2019re about 6 or 7 months out. it would be $140 for each of them for the trip? This is enough time for them to earn the amount.  If they can all earn that money before you leave then I\u2019d do it but they have to pay for it. I would also say they all need to earn it and they can all get it because I wouldn\u2019t want one of them to do all of this work and then be forced to share. It would be all or nothing. \n\nThey\u2019re old enough to be babysitting or mothers helpers for friends or neighbors, shovel snow, help with gardening. It\u2019s a ridiculous amount of money for what it is (who knows if it\u2019s even going to be good internet?), but it\u2019s on them to pay for it.", "NTA. But maybe get ONE subscription for a laptop or tablet and set some time aside for each of them to maybe have 30 minutes a day to do what they need to on it.", "NAH: I get why they want it, but I wouldn\u2019t get it either. That\u2019s a lot of money already, on top of the money for the cruise. But they\u2019re not used to living in a disconnected world and they probably looked forward to posting pics for their friends to see and comment on. \n\nWhen I visit my brother on another continent, I get a cheap phone package through AT&T for emergencies, so that I barely use the internet if I\u2019m not in his house. It\u2019s actually great. It forces me to really enjoy the country and the sites! I never really realized how often I checked social media, the news, etc through the day on my phone!  And I use it sparely in the house (mostly work related). \n\nSo I think they\u2019ll be just fine. They\u2019re on a ship with a million things to do!", "Definitely NTA.  Cruise ships are meant to be enjoyed for the activities offered.  They can bring along books or games as well.", "NAH. I personally would get the package, but you know your own children. It\u2019s great if they can disconnect for a while, but they will want to post pictures and still keep in touch with friends. If you hire a safe, it might be an idea that they can have devices and internet in the day and phones are locked away for dinner? So you can all spend quality time, but the children can still keep in touch.", "Don't do it. And no you wouldn't be a jerk for not getting it as well. From what I understand and especially not having been on a cruise myself, they have lots of different activities for the kids and different age groups even. You need to check those out and give those a chance first before breaking down and getting internet packages. It sounds like your kids get a lot of screen time anyway when they're at home. Missing a week of it won't hurt them and if they get bored well boredom is just as good for them every now and again and small doses as having a whole bunch of screen time. Actually screen time is very unhealthy if they get too much of it. So set your foot down and say we are not getting internet and that's final your mom and I agree on this. I wouldn't be bringing in other family members in on it because they're going to probably tell you opposite of what you're thinking. It's your trip and they're your kids and you make the rules.", "Is there a daily option? If so, I would offer to get the wifi for one day, say day 3, if they were really bored after two days.", "There teenagers course they are going to want internet", "Info: will you be going without internet for the trip?  If not, figure out a way to share the plan. Or have your kids earn it with chores or some sort of merit system.", "YTA. Even when I was on vacation in Greece, there\u2019s downtime between activities. People need time to recharge. And who knows their psychology, if they even want to be in this trip.", "NAH. It may be hard for them and they may feel anxious as studies have shown, so be prepared for that. Can\u2019t they use it on shore too though? I know many places you can find somewhere with WiFi or get the international plan for the phones, so they\u2019ll still be able to check in.", "NTA. But also\u2026 this is gonna sound terrible\u2026 how much would you pay for peace. How adaptable are your kids? I have kids some of mine would get to the cruise and find so many other things to do and it wouldn\u2019t matter. But my twins\u2026 (they are 6 and autistic and have always had a terrible time with change) would have meltdowns daily and I\u2019m not sure any of us would enjoy the vacation if they didn\u2019t have it. Yours are older and likely are more adaptable and might not even miss it once they get to all the areas and activities but do whatever you think will let you enjoy the vacation as well.", "NAH. Is there any way to buy it for just a few days? Listen this is the first generation growing up online. People love to act high and mighty about kids being addicted to phones and not going outside. Except none of us ever had that option before. Earlier generations love to act superior but they didn't choose being outside over their phones. Playing outside was like the only thing they could do.\n\nThen again there is nothing wrong with not buying it. I just hate when we shame kids as though we made better choices. We didn't.", "NTA, but there are ways where you can just pay for one person and share it amongst all of them.", "If you don\u2019t get the package you\u2019re gonna have an awful trip of \u201cI\u2019m boooooooored\u201d every five seconds despite being on an actual cruise ship designed to keep people entertained.", "Oh, for goodness sake!! You\u2019re talking about teens who you have provided mobile phones to socialise. Suddenly, you want them to go cold turkey so they can do \u2018other fun things\u2019. \n\nWhat if they don\u2019t want to do other fun things and would rather stay on social media most of the day? If those kids came on Reddit to complain, some of these people giving you advice would be the first to ask them to go NC once they turn 18. Be for real!", "How long is a week?\n\nTo you it's 5 days working and two days deconpressing.\n\nNow do some pre-teen math:\n\nLife happens in summer. That's when the big awesome memories are made (and shared!! In this day and age).\n\nSo life is about 8 weeks.\n\nOne week is half of a quarter of that.\n\nThe awesome summers they can remember and had more to say about than \"weeee sand, weee water\" start when? At 8, maybe?\n\nSo it's the 4th summer in your 12yo's life.\n\nAnd while everybody else is sharing what they're doing in their 4th summer, you're applying adult logic and and force them to unplug while they're doing probably the most exciting and post-able thing of their 4rth summer...\n\nYou'll get plenty of adult logic here telling you that your kids are addicted and forcing them offline is a good thing and that a week is not that long and so on and so forth... but putting on some 12yo's shoes, I'd say that's mean.\n\nI'm probably alone with this but, yes, YWBTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If they want it so much then explain what it costs and that they will need to help pay for it. This could m an extra chores or babysitting or whenever way they could make some extra money. I grew up helping to pay for extras on vacation and if I didn't want the extra then I didn't have to pay for it.\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA. Not only is the cost insane, it\u2019s a vacation. I honestly don\u2019t even think you be the AH if you left all the devices at port and did a digital detox for a week.", "On one cruise, we found an Internet cafe and bought 30 minutes of time so our teen daughter can catch up with her friends. I also checked my email.\n\nBut one thing I didn't want us to do is to post on Facebook that we were out of town. My daughter honored that (hubby isn't on social media). When we returned, I uploaded photos onto FB to show off our trip.\n\nI think our last cruise, we got an Internet package, but it was sooooo slow as we were in the middle of the Pacific Ocean (we take long cruises). On that one, my daughter had found a group of kids her age, so they kept busy hanging out with each other and going to the movies on deck and the entertainment shows.", "NTA. They can use the free local wifi wherever you dock. My kids (high school age at that time) was grumpy at first when we didn\u2019t have internet but they ended up having a blast on the cruise - there\u2019s so much to do. And they also used the internet to their hearts content whenever the ship stopped at a port.\n\nAlso, I did end up having to buy internet once - that was because one kid had to submit some stuff for her future college \n\nAnd I have another rule - especially if they earn their own money (like from babysitting) or get a regular allowance - I pay for everything of course, except for souvenirs. They are free to spend their own money on souvenirs or shopping for non-essential needs", "NTA - WiFi on the cruise ships can be absolute crap and if they can't connect the cruise line isn't likely to refund your money.  They can access socials when they are in port.  If it's really that important to them they can earn some money doing chores to pay for it.", "NTA. They don\u2019t have important jobs to keep track of right? Should be plenty to keep them occupied on the cruise.", "NTA if it\u2019s just for social purposes rather than school.

In the meantime they can take photos in preparation for uploading/sharing.", "Most of the time the idea of a cruise and a vacation is to break the routine and chill out.

There are plenty of games you can play without internet and the ship will have a ton of activities to do as well. Tell them if they come up with the money to cover the internet package you will get it. I did a cruise with my kids (I\u2019m divorced) and we would call or FaceTime their dad when we were close enough to land to get a signal. Otherwise my phone was just an accessory. It was nice to unplug.\n\nEdited to add judgment: NTA kids are too reliant on their devices and some time away will be good for them.", "NTA. These kids these days need a break from internet and social media BS. They should be able to have fun without constantly taking selfies or tik tok videos. \n\nDont cave on this.

My 12 year old niece went on a cruise with my parents and had an absolute blast with the friends she found on there since my parents and her parents didn't pay for her wifi.

Our kids could access it but it wasn't great in their interior room. I'd say skip it unless there's a reason you need it. One of our boys pretty much stayed by himself in the room when we weren't doing things trying to make it work and the other had a blast wandering the ship by himself. \n\nThey'll be fine.", "NTA. They\u2019ll look back and be thankful smelling fresh salt water and doing kid things having fun with family instead of filming tiktoks all day and staring at a screen.

Depending on what cruise line and ship, there are potentially a lot to do. However, be prepare for continuous pouting or difficulty with them when they get bored. If I were you I would get it for 1 device and let everyone use it at a scheduled time. That way they can still be on social media and you would have time as family.", "NTA. It's really expensive on the ships! This might differ by cruise line, but if you don't purchase it and also don't put your phone into airplane mode, the phone will connect up and charge you roaming fees. So if you don't trust your kids to put them into airplane mode, it might be cheaper to buy the package...", "Get one day so they can check into SM mid holiday and tell the kids if they want more they pay for it out of their savings.

A week of being without will be good for them.", "NTA. I work on cruise ships and the kids won't be bored. There is so much for them to do, both on board and ashore - get them in the kids club so they can make friends their own age. Honestly, they'll moan about the lack of internet now but I reckon they'll barely mention it once they're on board.\n\nThe line I work for gives free messaging through their app without purchasing a package, so you can message your kids if you split up on board, and you can also track their location.\n\nIf you do purchase an Internet plan be aware that it may be limited to one device - ours are restricted and can't be transferred. I get around it because you can do a mobile hotspot from wifi on Samsung phones, but my iPhone friends were stuck with one device.", "NTA..There will be a lot of things to do on the cruise depending on the line you are going with. They also will have the chance to connect with new people and make friends there. Some lines have also the option of texting only which is cheaper. Just go trough what is being offered on the specific ship you are traveling on. The ships also stop in different Amazing destinations and is very easy to find WiFi on the ports of call.", "NTA. Tell them that it's *not* fast internet and they wouldn't be able to access most social media - because most of the time, it isn't and they won't.\n\nAnd even if it has improved, they'll live. They can go a week where parts of it will be without TikTok.", "A cautionary tale. My grandmother died while my cousins were on a Caribbean cruise. We were not able to get through to them by phone or email and they only found out when they got back to dock. My uncle was devasted. Might be a good insurance policy to get internet on one device for any emergencies.", "Absolutely do not pay for it every night. *Maybe* tell them they get a connection for a while in the middle and maybe another one right before the end. then they can touch base with friends or post pics or whatever.\n\nand if they want more time than this tell them to provide you the money.", "INFO can you just play it by ear and see if they're distracted by like day two? Pick a day in the middle of the cruise so they can update their friends but won't stay all seven days on their phones? NTA but there are compromises right?", "NTA. I took my kids on a cruise. They were 14, 12, and 9. I did not get the internet. My daughter was all incensed about ruining her Snapchat streaks. They had a blast, and now she laughs at herself for that.

What will they do if your internet at home ever goes out?\n\nI would be surprised if there weren't a bunch of kids activities, they should be trying these out. Even just to learn they don't like whatever it is, they should try. \n\nIf you picked an adult style cruise with nothing for the kids & not many shore excursions, maybe compromise on a day or two if out at sea a lot.", "NTA \n\nDon\u2019t buy the package \n\nThey should pool their money and splurge on 1 day of internet if they decide they need it that bad, but require that the 1st three days are internet free.\n\nThey\u2019ll make friends and find things to do.", "NTA\n\nCruises do not require internet\n\nYou'll find you will mainly miss being able to text each other and ask where they are so you'll have to go back to the old fashioned \"meet here at x time\"", "They can still take pics in airplane mode and post later, which is safer anyway for not telling everyone your house is empty NTA", "NTA. I'd skip the internet entirely and focus on enjoying your trip as a family. I'm sure there are plenty of things to do without needing internet connection. If you're stopping in at ports there would also be free wifi in some places too. At most I might get wifi for 1 laptop to be shared between everyone for the trip.\nI might be an a$$hole myself, but I'd ask your mother and brother if they're paying for the internet for your girls since it's oh-so important to them.", "NTA.

They could also download stuff to watch on Netflix ahead of time. You could also get it on just your device, and allow them time each day to check their socials. Or, you could just get them 1 day each at around 3-4 days to check in with their friends. Hopefully they will go to the youth clubs and make some friends.", "Nta,   I did buy my sons internet on 2 days and they each paid for 1 more day each so they had it for a little less than half,  seemed like a decent compromise", "NTA. If they want it they can pay for it. If you are a family that can afford a 7 day cruise for 6 people then surely they have some cash from gifts laying around. Or they can do extra chores to earn it.", "NTA\nIt's also smart to remember with a bunch of teens posting that the whole family is away on vacation.\n\nI'm of the old school way of not posting anything until I'm home.\nThey have a full week away on a ship with stuff happening all over and will most likely meet other kids.", "Nta, everywhere we've been on holiday always has Internet included so it's never been an argument but it certainly isn't something I'd be paying for if the situation arose. I'm sure they can go without social media and games for a week, if they can't then they're access needs restricting now to make them less reliant on it.", "This is insane. You\u2019d pay $560 for your children to have their faces in Snapchat the entire week. NTA.", "Have they got Internet caf\u00e9 on board? If so, give them money for the Internet and once it\u2019s gone has gone", "Your kids sound spoiled. Do not buy them the internet package.", "NTA unless they are doing Duolingo - I\u2019d be distraught if I lost my streak.", "NTA. $560 is no small chunk of change. Especially on top of all the expenses of the rest of the cruise. I would simply tell them it\u2019s not in the budget. \n\nThey aren\u2019t going to miss out of that much socially by being off line 7 days in the summer.", "NTA. If they want it, they can use their savings to pay for it.", "NTA. Buy them water proof disposable cameras instead. Then they can have fun posting old timey photos when they get home and get them developed.", "NTA\n\nI didn't get internet on a 7 day cruise because I couldn't afford it. There was so much to do and it was actually amazing to unplug for a week. It will be good for them.\n\nDo make sure you have devices with movies and books downloaded. They can still use their phones when they have down time.  I used my old phone - deleted all the apps I didn't need on it and just filled it up with downloaded wntertainment.\n\nAnd you are able to rent movies in your cabin and they have some for free..", "This is a good opportunity for the kids to save their allowance,  birthday money etc to buy something that is really important to them.  You are paying for transport, accommodation,  food, any extras they want they can fund.  They have 6+ months notice.  I suspect that when paying for themselves,  they may decide that internet every single day on the cruise is not necessary.  Good luck!  NTA", "NTA and it blows my mind that people are criticizing you for this. Your children will survive one week without internet. It will not destroy their social life. Why even bother going in a trip if not having internet will ruin it you can stay home and be on the internet. Alternately (I know your kids are young) they can pay for their own internet.", "They dont need games on a cruise\n\nThey can get 3 days of internet to post online and catch up with friends", "NTA. But in curious, what cruise line are you going on? My husband and I are going on Royal Caribbean later this month. I know you can pay for wifi on board for just one day, if that something you would consider. Also with Royal Caribbean you would have the ability to purchase 4 devices for one person rather than one device for 4 people which works out cheaper. Four devices for one person still allows all of them to have the wifi, they just have to share the login info.", "Personally I kinda like the aspect of being unplugged, coming from someone with a severe phone addiction. I think it can be great for kids to learn to entertain themselves without. Plus sometimes some of the stops have internet so they can upload pics if they want or something.", "NTA. Your children are addicted to the Internet and social media. Research says it is similar to a gambling addiction. It is also a f uped place full of creeps where kids access should be limited and monitored. \n\nThis lovely trip you planned can be the first step to help them.\n\nAnd yes, I do believe most of us are addicted, though it is usually not affecting adult brains as badly.\n\nI also think most people are bad parents for not doing anything about their kids Internet addiction. The reason it is widely accepted is that ALMOST EVERYONE does it (lazy parenting, but it's OK as you are all so busy and tired) so no one criticises anyone.  Would you not do anything if your children were betting online or smoking weed or cigarettes? There is really no difference.\n\nI don't have kids so I do not need to lie to myself that it's OK for kids to be addicts.", "NTA. they should be grateful for the cruise they don\u2019t need to be sitting on social media.

Get wifi for 1-2 days in the middle to check in then off again", "NTA there's plenty to keep you busy and engaged on a cruise.", "NTA, and this is coming from a former daddy\u2019s girl who was spoiled as f*ck. They can read books or do a zillion activities.", "Believe it or not, many of us survived quite nicely before there was internet.   We used to do this old fashioned thing called conversation, it involved talking to one another, face to face.  We would actually spend time together doing things, not once even feeling the need to check our 6\u201d little devices.   Ahhh the good old days.", "NTA-they will be fine. Or, make them work for it. They can get it if they pay for it.", "NTA! There will be plenty for them to do on the cruise. They can still take pictures and post them afterward. Plus, it's never a good idea to post on social media that you're on vacation because someone could see your home is vacant and burglarize it.  Always post after you're home. If they really want the internet that badly they could earn the money themselves. It's 140/kid. Babysitting and being a mothers helper (for the 11 and 12 yr Olds)  could earn them that in no time.", "Do you want them on their devices or enjoying the cruise?  Yes, they will absolutely miss being online and they can absolutely deal with it. \n\nyou stated a per person cost, but is it per person or per device?  if it's the former I'm not sure how it's policed other than assuming everyone is using it, but if it's the latter a reasonable compromise might be a single family device that everyone gets limited time on. That way everyone can still enjoy the cruise and keep in touch with friends.", "Gee, your biggest mistake is going to your mom and brother after your wife said no. Come on!\n\nDepending what cruise ship you are going on. Panorama even has cooking classes and a trampoline room. There are kids clubs with things going on during the cruise. Game room, scavenger hunts\u2026\u2026 \n\nYour wife is right. They will survive one week without the internet and will forgo everything because they won\u2019t unplug. Put the money towards events.\n\nI have done the tile painting one trip and Las Caletas in another at Puerto Vallarta. My son loved Las Caletas. \n\nDone the villages excursion in Mazatlan. Might be good for your kids to see how other people live. The one where you go to three different towns.\n\nDid the dolphin in Cabo - meh.", "NTA!  It\u2019s acceptable for your kids to unplug for a  for a week!  Why take a vacation for your children to be on their phones and tablets?  I am so glad to have raised my kids prior to every person over age 3 having a smart phone. My kids were in high school when it became  standard for every kid to have a phone - but there were limits!!! I understand many things were different then, and schools were (arguably) safer.  But if you walk around anywhere there are teenagers, they are engaging with their phones, adults too. I can help but think you are missing things if you are always looking down", "If my kids just wanted to spend all their time on their phone or gaming on a vacation I would leave them at home-why waste the money? If you have family or friends who would watch them then give the kids a choice-stay home and possibly miss some fun and different things or stay home and do the same thing. If they do go then no phone. $560+ is a lot to pay for 4 kids to sit in their room. Tough choice", "NTA.\n\nIt will not hurt your children to be without wifi for a week.\n\nI have a STVR, one of the things that brings families back year after year is the lack of technology.  They come to disconnect from technology and reconnect with each other.", "I would bring one device and let each kid use it timed", "Nta, a week away from social media would probably do them all some good. Also as a father of twins you dont need to say two twins, twins is inherently two. Unless you are talking about having two separate sets of twins.  Its like saying atm machine, machine is completely unnecessary.....", "Are you giving them any money for souvenirs and other stuff?  How about you tell each kid \"you get $XX amount to spend on the trip.  It's up to you whether you spend it on internet or on other items\"?  Then they can each decide whether or not the internet is worth it to the individually and how often.   \n\nMy mom did that to me when I was asking to buy something on a trip.  You can buy this now, or save the money for something else later.", "Let's face facts here.  You're going to get the internet package.  You're kids aren't good at parenting because you haven't taught them to and thus you will get the internet package to make them happy instead of teaching a life lesson, which is why you'll get the internet package and they won't learn to share or entertain themselves or read a book.", "NTA, from personal experience. I went on a cruise for my cousins quince (we were all around 15yrs old) and she got every amenity you could think of while I didn't. But I'll tell you what, I did everything on that boat that I could, I was all over the place. I'll be honest I didn't spend much time with my family other than on excursions but I had a blast meeting new people at the teen dances and just having the freedom to do what I wanted.", "What a nightmare. Nta op. They could do with a week of no WiFi.", "NTA\npersonally I didn\u2019t even get a phone till I was 14 so I don\u2019t really see the need for your kids to have constant access to one aside from your 14 yo daughter \n\neven then one week really isn\u2019t that long to be without it", "They can still take pictures and post them when they get home or at port. \n\nIt's not like it's a few quid for the Internet option. it will do them the world of good to get away from socials for a week.", "Try to stop them from finding internet somehow. Report back.", "NTA \n\nIf I was taking my kids on a cruise, unless they are paying for it themselves they're not getting Internet.\n\n\nI might get it for myself just in case.

Chances are itll be worse than plane wifi.", "No, don't get the internet! Especially since you wife doesn't want to.", "Nta. When I've been on a cruise with my teen brother, I bought internet but it was to keep an eye on my work email. He got it to keep an eye on his online school messages. \n\nWe really didn't use it besides that. The internet on cruise ships always kinda sucks so they'll probably just get frustrated by the lag times. \n\nAlso, that is ridiculously expensive. When we went on Carnival, it was a flat $50 for the middle tier internet for the entire 6 day cruise.", "Who's in charge the parents or the kids? They will survive without the internet.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to want wifi for periods of downtime. I personally would want it for my kindle app, to keep up with the news, do crosswords etc. while sunbathing or resting. These things obviously won\u2019t appeal to teenagers but I\u2019m sure there are plenty of apps suitable to their age. \n\nMaybe the solution is to limit access to their phones to certain times each day, so they\u2019re not glued to their phones constantly?

We all enjoyed doing other things!", "NTA. As an internet addicted kid I actually appreciated the offline time on holidays.

You know what happened when one school banned phones at school during school hours - the students transitioned.  Kids actually gathered to talk with each other at lunch and in between classes.  You could see individuals and groups actually having conversations with each other.  If kids needed to call parents, the could go to the office -- just like we used to for emergencies.  Parents could call the school for emergencies.  You know what else??  The kids actually liked it.  It's like stepping back in time, and people actually learning how to socialize face to face again.  It's amazing.  It's sickening watching families at restaurants and everyone is on the phone and not even talking with each other or kids being in the car and rather than talking to each other, they're texting each other.

Definitely don't buy the ship internet package, everyone I know who has bought it in the past says the internet is super slow and sucks.

They won't be able to do things like make or upload tiktoks, probably won't even be able to watch them or YouTube videos. Bad, slow internet.\n\nDepending on where you're going on the cruise, call your cell carrier and ask about international and cruise plans. When I cruised from New Orleans to Mexico, AT&T set me up with a package that gave me international wifi access and limited calls/texts (I had dogs at boarding, so for emergencies). I don't recall what the exact cost was, but it definitely wasnt $20/day. I want to say it was in the ballpark of $50-60 one time fee, and it was good for seven days, I think.\n\nI will say, though, it wasn't much better than folks say the cruise ship internet is. IE: pretty slow, videos don't want to load, etc. But I was able to upload pics and short video clips to my social media, access and scroll FB and IG, but there were plenty of times that loading even FB was sketchy and lagged. You'd have to be careful with the call/text limits, especially with preteen girls. Or just tell them there is no calls and texts allowed at all and hope they don't test it. But if you feel like you HAVE to give them something, I'd definitely call your carrier before I'd ever pay $20/day per device on the ship.\n\nBut, as everyone else has said, they won't die without internet for a week. There is so much to do on the ship, endless food options, pools, slides, games and events.

Almost 20 years ago, I spent 6 weeks in Asia just using internet cafes every couple of days (when the internet was even available).

It\u2019s easy to say something is a NEED (vs a want) when it\u2019s mom and dad\u2019s money.  Or give them a budget of spending money and they can choose if they want to use it for WiFi, souvenirs, activities etc.  I\u2019ll often give my 9 and 7 year old small budgets for things like this so they learn that money isn\u2019t unlimited.", "They will be on a CRUISE.

The things that appeal to your young child and pre-teen group doesn\u2019t often appeal to them. Same goes for the adult activities. Socialization is a major part of teen activity, even pre-social media and always connected living.
