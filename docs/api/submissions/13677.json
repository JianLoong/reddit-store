So all of my husband\u2019s friends are also my friends and all my friends are his friends.\n\nI\u2019ve know my best friend (A) for 15 years, we\u2019ve always been extremely close and lived together at one point, she\u2019s literally part of my family, she comes to all of my family events, my siblings refer to her as their sister and she just been extremely involved in my life for years.\nNow, me and my husband have a 6 month old daughter. My dad is extremely wealthy so he helps us out financially until my daughter is old enough to go to school, then i will take a job at his company that pays well. My husband has a job that he works from 7am - 4 pm and then afterwards him and his friends often hangout at my house or at one of their house\u2019s. \n\nHere\u2019s the problem, my husband\u2019s best friend cheated on my best friend a few weeks ago, she\u2019s completely heartbroken and since they lived together my husband and i agreed that it\u2019s okay that she stays with us until they work things out. She\u2019s not really up to seeing him just yet. A is a huge help with the baby, she\u2019s so good with her and the baby loves her. When my husband and his friends get home they normally talk until 8 pm ish so he doesn\u2019t help with the baby too much when he gets home, which i don\u2019t mind it\u2019s just nice to have a little help. Yesterday night my husband opened the front door , peaked his head in, looked right at me and A , rolled his eyes and walked out. Him and his friends came in a few moments later and were all being cold and rude to A all evening. After an hour or two my husband walks right up to me and A and says \u201cdoes she always have to be here? I want to bring (friends name) here tonight.\u201d And rolled his eyes, i responded \u201cif i want to bring my best friend into the house my dad paid for, i can, and if i choose to have somebody help me with the baby that you\u2019re not looking after, it\u2019s going to be her.\u201d His friends just sat there silently and he just walked away and sat back down . He\u2019s giving me the silent treatment and A left and is staying with her mom as she feels uncomfortable being in the house now.

YTA for your immediate reaction to his question and he's TA for saying something so rude in front of her. Obviously him not helping you with the baby as often angers you or you wouldn't have immediately thrown that at him.

You say that your friend groups have joined. So your husband, father of a young child, has to hang out with his buddies for hours every day? He should be helping raise his child. Being a parent doesn\u2019t mean no more friends, but he still needs to raise his child. It is pretty clear that his issue with A being there isn\u2019t so much that you have a friend there. You have the person that his buddy cheated on there. How can his buddy that cheated feel comfortable with that? Because his friends are the priority. Although you weren\u2019t great with the comment about you can have who you want in the house your dad paid for. I\u2019m sure all your friends already know it, but it\u2019s still not a great statement. None of you, except A, come across well in this. Yes, you\u2019re raising your infant child, but you have to rely on your father\u2019s support. You\u2019re relying on your friend to help care for your child. What part is your husband playing? I suspect that A might be reevaluating her life while she is staying with her mother. I would if I realized I was staying with a friend, caring for her child, in the house her daddy paid for while her husband was whining that my being their was infringing on his hours of bro time with the guy that cheated on me.

You could have sit hom down in his place without attack like that\n\nBut under your words i feel a deep crack between you 2 its like you are not very happy that your father helps financially and you are not happy with how much your husband makes and clearly you don't respect him . You might have a deeper problem. It would be wise to address it", "ESH\n\nSounds like you said that to your husband out of spite because he doesn't help as much. You don't get to make the rules of your marriage in a house that doesn't belong to either one of you but your dad. \n\nYour husband should've talked to you in private about A. He didn't need to say anything right in front of her and make her uncomfortable.", "ESH. He is for obvious reasons, so are his friends. You went for the attack when provoked, which I kinda get, but it wasn't even based on the same topic. He brought up A being there and him wanting to have his cheating friend over, you didn't shut this down or made the boundry clear, but went for the: my daddy pays for everything and you suck as a dad. That is not fair to A either because you just put her in the middle in a much bigger fight within your relationship, which had nothing to do with her! \n\nSo yeah, the only non AH is A who got mistreated by her husband, her best friend and her best friends husband and in front of even more of her friends, who made it clear they are on her husbands side in this! No wonder she left after this!\n\nEdit: Dear downvoters, really?! Read the post again and put yourself in As shoes and think if maybe you would be kinda mad at your friend for this, because I am sure most of you would be! I'd be really interested in your reasonings, but this being reddit, it's probably well the guy was a dick first so OP was right to be a dick back without any concern for the person this fight was originally about and has enough on her plate already", "ESH.", "ESH. Super weak of him to passively aggressively go at people who's been chested on and petty on you blowing up his spot with the seeming intent to embarrass him.", "Wow, yeah thats as asshole move.\n\nMarried adults that share a home need to respect each other regardless of how the house is bought.\n\nIf a guy said something to his wife like \"I bought this house if you don't like XYZ you can get out\" they would be roasted alive.\n\nWow, real swing and a miss to rub the finances in his face, not a loving partner thing to do AT ALL.\n\nSecond, you fucked up by mixing like 3 different problems into something that should be simple/ entry level marriage skills. \n\nThe main problem here is that you and your husband need to communicate like mature people, about how many days per week you each will have guests.\n\nBoth of you could/should have had a no pressure conversation about wanting some nights without guests WAY before getting snippy.\n\nIf you both want a lifestyle with an open-house feel, you still need to have a conversation about privacy and couple time, so I am baffled why you  would do a public tantrum instead of a private conversation. \n\nNext, if you want your husband more involved with parenting, say that. You can totally have a rational conversation about family time, without saving it to throw on a burn pile of grievances. This is really passive aggressive, and immature behavior. \n\nLastly, obviously don't manufacture situations where you loudly and publicly choose your friend over your spouse.\n\nEven if she is like a sister to you, anyone would know that putting a sibling ahead of their spouse is bound to be needlessly hurtful.

I simply believe that her response to his comment about A was a bit more personal and harsh for her to put out in front of everyone, especially when this man is supposed to be her partner.", "he could have done that in private instead of in front of everyone including A. He wanted to flex for his friends and it backfired\n\nyou should read it again before replying cause you missed basic details", "You said its emasculating but the fact is no one forced him into that house he could have declined it but he didnt. He can't be rude to people who are helping take care of his child that he does nothing about. OP spoke the truth and if that hurts his feelings he is welcome to divorce or fix his mistakes. \n\nRespect is earned and OPs husband hasnt done anything to earn that respect", "what does he provide though? I really would like to know since her father is also giving her money while the kid is small and the job comes after the kid starts school.", "I agree. I forgot that small detail, and not exactly sure about its relevance to the story now that I'm thinking about it lol", "Classic advice. Dump the Motherfucker Already.", ">I simply believe that her response to his comment about A was a bit more personal and harsh for her to put out in front of everyone, especially when this man is supposed to be her partner.\n\nHe decided to be rude and insulting to A who is helping take care of his baby in front of everyone. He chose that. He got rudeness back and if that hurt he needs to make changes and speak instead of the silent treatment. He started this situation and needs to own his role in it. OP is at fault but not moreso than her husband. They are equally the assholes here and need to work on their marriage and family instead of hanging out with friends or living off daddy's money.", "No I read and understood it. He was rude but her comments back were completely uncalled for. She doesn't have money daddy does and hubby does. She's just part of the package.", "If OP doesn't respect him then why tf did she marry him? Do you hear yourself? OP literally said that to him out of spite, in front of all of their friends to lash out at him because of his rude comment about A. 1. Don't air your dirty laundry in public. Take that mess to a separate room. 2. Emasculating because many men struggle with feeling that way when they aren't the breadwinner or other situations such as this. 3. OP states they have no problem with him hanging out with his friends and not taking care of the baby as much as her, then throws that at him the moment she's angry. Bottom line, they're both wrong and need to have a long, calm discussion. At least they do if they want to have a lasting relationship because not communicating with each other and lashing out at each other, especially publicly, is the fastest way to end the relationship.", "That Was the reason of (not saying he deserves it) im just talking about her feelings.\nLove without respect is nothing. But before that he should be respectable (not saying he is)..", ">1. Don't air your dirty laundry in public. Take that mess to a separate room. 2. Emasculating because many men struggle with feeling that way when they aren't the breadwinner or other situations such as this.\n\nso for the first point: OPs husband decided to act like a big shot infront of his friends that is wrong and OP correctly brought him down to earth. The second point: if men feel that way they should work on that without trying to overcompensate by trying to be the \"man of the house\" like OPs husband did by being so rude to OP and A. OPs husband knew she was from a rich family when they got married. He happily accepted a house paid for by her father and the money the father gives her when she isnt working. He actively does these things. OPs husband created this situation by his own actions. If he has a big problem with the fact that his lifestyle is provided for by his father in law thats on him. No one put a gun to his head to marry OP or have kids with her. \n\nAgain you keep minimizing his actions to just attack OP. ESH is a fine verdict but the emasculation argument you keep using doesnt fly cause OPs husband activley chose to be married to OP, have a kid with OP and not help out, and have a house and lifestyle financed by OPs father.", "What i see is someone who is happy to use all the benefits of OPs dad (house and money for the kid when OP isnt working) and hang out with his friends after work. \n\nSometime rudeness needs to be answered with rudeness to get some change.", "Lmmfao we obviously aren't going to completely agree on this, and that's okay. I feel they were both wrong and both acted like AHs. Hope you enjoy your night\ud83d\ude42", "It might be that. But we don't know their full life. We only have a small window that op offers in the post. We can't read between the lines. There are a lot of variables missing to judge some one based on what some else tells about them in one case.\n\nImagine another ATIA post when the husband writes his story that i work 9 hours a day in a very stressful job(not that  he has i really think he is immature as f...) And my wife's best friend is always there doesn't allow me to decompress or something like that.... We just don't have all the data", "I agree both are wrong equally not that one is more the ah than the other I just find your whole emasculating argument wrong thats all. If Ops husband is upset about that then its on him since he chose to be in this situation", "I should state that I beleive its ESH just that they are equally the assholes for what they said both of them should not have been insulting to their guests and each other in public. \n\nfor the other point you made. If the OP of that post is doing all the work without any help from his wife and made a comment like that if his wife was being rude to him in front of her friend I would say that OP was not wrong in saying it. Its a marriage if your going to try and be a big shot infront of your buddies then you serve to be called out in front of them.", "Agree. They both made their choices lol nice debating with you\ud83d\ude09", "What im trying to point is when we hear a story or read a post we have minimum information maybe she is a terrific wife and he is a total loser or maybe she is horrible and she just limits the data to gain sympathy.\n\nBut we do know how ever they are . She has resentment towards him and that could lead to breaking of a marriage that have brought a small child to the world.\n\nMaybe by pointing that out they could repair their relationship and solve their problems", "Then the husband should speak instead of giving the silent treatment.", "NTA you are supporting someone who is basically family, and your actual family aka the father of your child/your husband is acting like a high school brat. Wow. His priorities are very off. Is he sponging?", "NTA, but your husband is a giant red flag. And you make a lot of excuses for him. Also, if he\u2019s cool with a cheater, then he\u2019s also cool with cheating. Think about that.", "I like the way you played the daddy bought the house card. Close to a royal flush. It\u2019s a tough situation. I wonder if that\u2019s why he agreed to let her stay at the house to begin with. He certainly didn\u2019t flinch about embarrassing her. So I will go with NTA.", "NTA. It's kinda sad that you expect and get so little from your husband.", "NTA\nYour husband is a jerk and a major AH.\nHe was being a jerk and you had every right to knock him down a peg.\n\nDoes your husband support his cheater friend?  If so, be careful, he may be the same way.\n\nNext time cheater is there, tell your husband that cheater isn't welcome in the house your father paid for.  Do it in front of his friends.  If he gets mad?  So what, he seems to approve of cheater's actions and so do they.  It won't be long until your husband becomes a cheater himself.  Tell you father everything.  I bet he will advise you to divorce your husband.  You can do better than him.", "NTA but you will be if you don\u2019t wake up and stand up for yourself. Your husband seems like a class A loser.", "NTA\nHe was being spicy and rude in front of his friends no no. You spoke the truth and his friends got quiet. Like yeah haha our friend doesn't really help his wife.", "NTA. Dump the useless husband and keep the friend. He seems interested in only two things- using your dad\u2019s money and hanging out with his equally useless friends.", "NTA but I'd rethink things sounds like he's no help and he supports cheaters", "NTA. He asked for it. Trying to show off and be a big man in front of his friends. Putting him in his placed was deserved. He sounds like a lazy husband and father.", "Your husband wants to stay friends with the cheater and is willing to fuck over the victim for it despite being close to her too. NTA but run sis", "ESH It\u2019s AH to wave your Dad\u2019s contributions over his head and getting immersed in your friends\u2019 drama. It\u2019s AH for him to prioritize his drama-inducing friends instead of his wife and baby.  It\u2019s all pretty immature for people your age in your positions.", "Came here to say this.", "I agree with this person. \u2b06\ufe0f\n\nNTA", "\u2191 This, OP. He\u2019s condoning his friend\u2019s actions. Would love to know the kind of things he\u2019s saying to those guys behind your back if that\u2019s the way he\u2019s willing to treat poor A to your face.", "He said all of that so A could hear it.  His friends just as well learn that they are slime-balls for supporting Cheater.", "I mean OP\u2019s reply was well deserved. Her husband is terrible.", "Nah get out of here with that. While it would have been more courteous of OP to move the convo private, the husband brought this up in front of everyone so it in no way makes her an asshole for responding. It\u2019s not on her to rectify the husband\u2019s shitty behavior so that he doesn\u2019t get embarrassed for the thing he started.\n\nAlso, this dude has a baby and doesn\u2019t help at all until after 8 pm. Got a real winner here", "What an awful take. That\u2019s the most worthless, submissive, self-deprecating shit I\u2019ve seen all day, and I\u2019ve been on Reddit for like 6 hours. Please don\u2019t ever give anyone advice.", "He had that coming. F that guy.", "Sometimes a jack needs to have shit thrown back at him. He needed to be taken down quite a few pegs anyway.  He sounds like he could be a mooch.", "Her husband is probably out with the cheater.", "Well obviously you're getting downvotes for the judgement. So why do you think you'll be right about A's feelings? It doesn't matter, what OP went after her husband about. The fact that someone in the house didn't want her there, would have been enough to send her packing.\n\nAnd 100%, that's how I make my judgements. Husband started it, OP returned in kind. Different attack by OP, but at the same calibre. That makes OP NTA, if she elevated it, then it's E.S.H. if she went for the jugular(which i dont think it was), she would have been the AH", "horrible\n\nA has a bunch of internet randoms on her side", "He's not winning Partner of the Year so far, that's for sure", ">OP to move the convo private, the husband brought this up in front of everyone \n\nhe wanted to be a big boy and show his friends that he's the boss of the house lol", "ROFL don't hold back dude, let it all out\n\nPS do you actually know what \"self-deprecating\" means?", "The majority of people have no use for male bravado.  Anyone who thinks the husband was right are toxic people.", "How did type all that out and still not vote the husband as the AH???", "Yes, and knew as I hit reply that it wasn\u2019t a good fit, but what\u2019s done is done. I guess \u201cself-loathing\u201d would have been closer, since the commenter I was replying to seems to have been taught that they\u2019re not worth standing up for themselves unless they do so quietly, and in private, despite a vicious public attack.", "As a person, or just as a man?", "oh but he was emasculated by her saying that /s \n\nthats what alot of people were saying", "Still don't have a reply **from OP** as to whether her husband actually helps with the baby, is getting enough sleep, etc. Households with new babies are often hellscapes where everyone is semi-crazed due to lack of sleep.\n\nSo in my opinion, not enough INFO to condemn either person. That's all.", "She said it on her post.", "well hubby is enjoying daddy's money very nicely to try and act like he's some big shot. He was brought down to earth. Dont start fights in public when you know the truth. \n\nThey both suck for taking a fight public but no one side is more to blame they are equally stupid people", ">completely uncalled for.\n\nDiffering opinions. IMO it was definitely called for"]}
