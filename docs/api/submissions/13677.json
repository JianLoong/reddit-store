So all of my husband\u2019s friends are also my friends and all my friends are his friends.\n\nI\u2019ve know my best friend (A) for 15 years, we\u2019ve always been extremely close and lived together at one point, she\u2019s literally part of my family, she comes to all of my family events, my siblings refer to her as their sister and she just been extremely involved in my life for years.\nNow, me and my husband have a 6 month old daughter. My dad is extremely wealthy so he helps us out financially until my daughter is old enough to go to school, then i will take a job at his company that pays well. My husband has a job that he works from 7am - 4 pm and then afterwards him and his friends often hangout at my house or at one of their house\u2019s. \n\nHere\u2019s the problem, my husband\u2019s best friend cheated on my best friend a few weeks ago, she\u2019s completely heartbroken and since they lived together my husband and i agreed that it\u2019s okay that she stays with us until they work things out. She\u2019s not really up to seeing him just yet. A is a huge help with the baby, she\u2019s so good with her and the baby loves her. When my husband and his friends get home they normally talk until 8 pm ish so he doesn\u2019t help with the baby too much when he gets home, which i don\u2019t mind it\u2019s just nice to have a little help. Yesterday night my husband opened the front door , peaked his head in, looked right at me and A , rolled his eyes and walked out. Him and his friends came in a few moments later and were all being cold and rude to A all evening. After an hour or two my husband walks right up to me and A and says \u201cdoes she always have to be here? I want to bring (friends name) here tonight.\u201d And rolled his eyes, i responded \u201cif i want to bring my best friend into the house my dad paid for, i can, and if i choose to have somebody help me with the baby that you\u2019re not looking after, it\u2019s going to be her.\u201d His friends just sat there silently and he just walked away and sat back down . He\u2019s giving me the silent treatment and A left and is staying with her mom as she feels uncomfortable being in the house now.

Being a parent doesn\u2019t mean no more friends, but he still needs to raise his child. It is pretty clear that his issue with A being there isn\u2019t so much that you have a friend there. You have the person that his buddy cheated on there. How can his buddy that cheated feel comfortable with that? Because his friends are the priority. Although you weren\u2019t great with the comment about you can have who you want in the house your dad paid for. I\u2019m sure all your friends already know it, but it\u2019s still not a great statement. None of you, except A, come across well in this. Yes, you\u2019re raising your infant child, but you have to rely on your father\u2019s support. You\u2019re relying on your friend to help care for your child. What part is your husband playing? I suspect that A might be reevaluating her life while she is staying with her mother. I would if I realized I was staying with a friend, caring for her child, in the house her daddy paid for while her husband was whining that my being their was infringing on his hours of bro time with the guy that cheated on me.

You might have a deeper problem. It would be wise to address it", "ESH\n\nSounds like you said that to your husband out of spite because he doesn't help as much. You don't get to make the rules of your marriage in a house that doesn't belong to either one of you but your dad. \n\nYour husband should've talked to you in private about A. He didn't need to say anything right in front of her and make her uncomfortable.", "ESH. He is for obvious reasons, so are his friends. You went for the attack when provoked, which I kinda get, but it wasn't even based on the same topic. He brought up A being there and him wanting to have his cheating friend over, you didn't shut this down or made the boundry clear, but went for the: my daddy pays for everything and you suck as a dad. That is not fair to A either because you just put her in the middle in a much bigger fight within your relationship, which had nothing to do with her! \n\nSo yeah, the only non AH is A who got mistreated by her husband, her best friend and her best friends husband and in front of even more of her friends, who made it clear they are on her husbands side in this! No wonder she left after this!\n\nEdit: Dear downvoters, really?! Read the post again and put yourself in As shoes and think if maybe you would be kinda mad at your friend for this, because I am sure most of you would be! I'd be really interested in your reasonings, but this being reddit, it's probably well the guy was a dick first so OP was right to be a dick back without any concern for the person this fight was originally about and has enough on her plate already", "ESH.", "ESH.

You can totally have a rational conversation about family time, without saving it to throw on a burn pile of grievances. This is really passive aggressive, and immature behavior. \n\nLastly, obviously don't manufacture situations where you loudly and publicly choose your friend over your spouse.\n\nEven if she is like a sister to you, anyone would know that putting a sibling ahead of their spouse is bound to be needlessly hurtful.

She made an emphasis that her father purchased the house so she can have her friend there is she wants? It is very possible thst since this is just from the wife's perspective, that that conversation regarding having her friend there wasn't entirely equal, and the same argument could've been made to force the husband to pseudo agree, because clearly he did not wholly support the idea. A huge red flag on her part because this is psychological manipulation. \n\n2. It is possible that he only felt comfortable bringing it up publicly, as said in point 1. Private conversations with her may be more hostile or manipulative. We don't know the full story, only one side of it, which could be crafted to make us feel bad for the wife, because that's who it's written by. We also don't know his tone of voice throughout the discussion, I don't think his behaviour is reminiscent of someone bringing something up loudly, he very possibly could've whispered to said it at a lower voice while the wife could have blasted him loudly to put him on the spot. More manipulation. \n\n3. That's his best friend, assuming the other woman is not nearly as close with him as his own best friend, what do you expect? Again, two sides of every story. We just know that \"he cheated\" no other details are given. Did he really cheat? Was it a technical \"you cheated because you did x that wasnt sex but is the same as cheating.\" Again, none of this behaviour here is consistent with \"I am an asshole husband that supports cheating.\" a response from the husband could clear things up if matched with her story. What does the friend have to say for himself? I have been in very similar situations where a claim of \"he cheated\" was thrown against my friend and upon hearing his explanation, the woman was being ridiculous as there was no actual cheating. Nowadays, \"cheating\" can me literally anything from actual sex to liking someone post on Instagram. Again, we have no details, and I doubt that he would be so disgruntled about not having his friend around if he believed he did something so truly horrible. This in no way means he thinks cheating is okay.\n\n4. This I can agree on to some degree, if his wife is staying home while he works then roles have been decided, she could ask for help if she needed it, but a 7 to 4 job is just as if not more tiring than taking care of a child for the same amount of time. I think wanting to relax and hangout isn't so bad here, there isn't grand evidence of child negligence here, as the child is being taken care of by somebody. If this is a problem, she could have mentioned this a bit more gracefully. Also, why? Maybe home isn't that fun a place to be, there are often reasons as to why people avoid time with their family. These leech friend relationships that mean as much as family can often grow extremely toxic, and become a greater influence in a person's marriage than the people in the actual marriage itself. \n\n5. A silent treatment could be a perfectly reasonable response for when you no longer feel safe communicating with your partner without being manipulated or publicly embarrassed. Two sides to the coin, here. \n\n\n6. Even in the worst case scenario, taking this at face value. Marriage is not ok to be a tit for tat relationship. Your husband making a commotion in public? Try to not engage until in private, or encourage that he silence himself until he is in private. Remind him of his current company and that what he is saying is not appropriate. If you start acting spiteful like this, you won't be correcting behaviour. You will be filing for divorce in a few short years. This goes for both the husband and the wife. A marriage is a team that is more important than ALL of your external relationships. Parents included. No friend should tale importance over your partner's ability to feel comfortable communicating inside their own home. Regardless of who purchased the home and who owns it. It is your marital home. If you see it as a \"I bought this\" type of deal, then I'm sorry but you're waving red flags of manipulative and controlling behaviour.
