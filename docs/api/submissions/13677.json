So all of my husband\u2019s friends are also my friends and all my friends are his friends.\n\nI\u2019ve know my best friend (A) for 15 years, we\u2019ve always been extremely close and lived together at one point, she\u2019s literally part of my family, she comes to all of my family events, my siblings refer to her as their sister and she just been extremely involved in my life for years.\nNow, me and my husband have a 6 month old daughter. My dad is extremely wealthy so he helps us out financially until my daughter is old enough to go to school, then i will take a job at his company that pays well. My husband has a job that he works from 7am - 4 pm and then afterwards him and his friends often hangout at my house or at one of their house\u2019s. \n\nHere\u2019s the problem, my husband\u2019s best friend cheated on my best friend a few weeks ago, she\u2019s completely heartbroken and since they lived together my husband and i agreed that it\u2019s okay that she stays with us until they work things out. She\u2019s not really up to seeing him just yet. A is a huge help with the baby, she\u2019s so good with her and the baby loves her. When my husband and his friends get home they normally talk until 8 pm ish so he doesn\u2019t help with the baby too much when he gets home, which i don\u2019t mind it\u2019s just nice to have a little help. Yesterday night my husband opened the front door , peaked his head in, looked right at me and A , rolled his eyes and walked out. Him and his friends came in a few moments later and were all being cold and rude to A all evening. After an hour or two my husband walks right up to me and A and says \u201cdoes she always have to be here? I want to bring (friends name) here tonight.\u201d And rolled his eyes, i responded \u201cif i want to bring my best friend into the house my dad paid for, i can, and if i choose to have somebody help me with the baby that you\u2019re not looking after, it\u2019s going to be her.\u201d His friends just sat there silently and he just walked away and sat back down . He\u2019s giving me the silent treatment and A left and is staying with her mom as she feels uncomfortable being in the house now.

Being a parent doesn\u2019t mean no more friends, but he still needs to raise his child. It is pretty clear that his issue with A being there isn\u2019t so much that you have a friend there. You have the person that his buddy cheated on there. How can his buddy that cheated feel comfortable with that? Because his friends are the priority. Although you weren\u2019t great with the comment about you can have who you want in the house your dad paid for. I\u2019m sure all your friends already know it, but it\u2019s still not a great statement. None of you, except A, come across well in this. Yes, you\u2019re raising your infant child, but you have to rely on your father\u2019s support. You\u2019re relying on your friend to help care for your child. What part is your husband playing? I suspect that A might be reevaluating her life while she is staying with her mother. I would if I realized I was staying with a friend, caring for her child, in the house her daddy paid for while her husband was whining that my being their was infringing on his hours of bro time with the guy that cheated on me.

You might have a deeper problem. It would be wise to address it", "ESH\n\nSounds like you said that to your husband out of spite because he doesn't help as much. You don't get to make the rules of your marriage in a house that doesn't belong to either one of you but your dad. \n\nYour husband should've talked to you in private about A. He didn't need to say anything right in front of her and make her uncomfortable.", "ESH. He is for obvious reasons, so are his friends. You went for the attack when provoked, which I kinda get, but it wasn't even based on the same topic. He brought up A being there and him wanting to have his cheating friend over, you didn't shut this down or made the boundry clear, but went for the: my daddy pays for everything and you suck as a dad. That is not fair to A either because you just put her in the middle in a much bigger fight within your relationship, which had nothing to do with her! \n\nSo yeah, the only non AH is A who got mistreated by her husband, her best friend and her best friends husband and in front of even more of her friends, who made it clear they are on her husbands side in this! No wonder she left after this!\n\nEdit: Dear downvoters, really?! Read the post again and put yourself in As shoes and think if maybe you would be kinda mad at your friend for this, because I am sure most of you would be! I'd be really interested in your reasonings, but this being reddit, it's probably well the guy was a dick first so OP was right to be a dick back without any concern for the person this fight was originally about and has enough on her plate already", "ESH.", "ESH.

You can totally have a rational conversation about family time, without saving it to throw on a burn pile of grievances. This is really passive aggressive, and immature behavior. \n\nLastly, obviously don't manufacture situations where you loudly and publicly choose your friend over your spouse.\n\nEven if she is like a sister to you, anyone would know that putting a sibling ahead of their spouse is bound to be needlessly hurtful.

I am sure you have been flooded with responses but I feel a need to add to it\u2026 Your husband isn\u2019t a husband. It seems you\u2019ve married a teenager who feels entitled to living and being treated like a child. Divorce might seem scary, but it\u2019s worse when you wait until you\u2019re in your 30\u2019s after everything has gotten much worse.", "NTA. Your husband was being a thoughtless prick for no reason.\n\nHaving said that, saying \"the house my dad paid for\" *in front of his friends* must have bruised his ego and could breed deep resentment. It's only you who can decide if you really want to go there to shut him up.", "NTA.\n\nHe doesn't contribute financially and he ignores his child to go play with his friends. \n\nI guess you knew what you were marrying but I wouldn't have. Yikes.", "NTA\u2026 can you kick him out and move A in?", "get rid of the husband marry the bestfriend", "Throw the whole damn man out", "Any one with a 6 month old might consider coming home and being a parent, not hanging out every night with friends.", "ESH I was on your side until you stated that you threw the house in his face. That was a bullshit classless thing to do. Handle your grievances with him with adult communication so you don\u2019t have to be so passive aggressive. He should do the same. Dad needs to pay for marriage counseling. Neither of you seem to be an adult", "NTA for saying exactly what needed to be said. He's a child and failing as a partner and friend.", "Never. EVER. Down speak your spouse in front of anyone. 34 years together and neither of us have ever felt the need to openly shame the other. \n\nAsshole? I\u2019m thinking just on the side of it, but out of line.", "NTA. The fact that he literally rolled his eyes and said that in front of A. Because HE WANTED TO HANG OUT WITH THE CHEATER. Imagine being cheated on and then being treated like *you\u2019re* the problem/the inconvenience. Good on you for sticking up for her. \n\nIt\u2019s not good to flippantly throw divorce around, but I\u2019d highly consider looking into. Look into his actions since you\u2019ve known him and really think if he\u2019s the type of person you want you and your baby around. Clearly his moral compass is askew, because what he pulled there was just disgusting behavior.", "I agree- and I would be concerned that he is more invested in siding with the friend right now because that kind of behavior does seem to say that his cheating was no big deal. And that he understands why his friend did that and it was okay - especially if he wants to bring that guy into their home and displace A who they both agreed could stay there. \n\nHe is displaying a complete lack of maturity by thinking it\u2019s okay EVERY NIGHT after work to hang with his friends vs. help take care of his family too. Time for him to grow up or to take a hike. He\u2019s acting like an entitled teenager not a person who is old enough to be married, have a child, and earn a living. And he seems to have a flexible moral center which to me bodes badly.", "Also get impression that he knew about the cheating and his lack of involvement might indicate he might not have an issue doing so himself", "This is bizarre.  Who the hell has time to hang out with friends every day after work?  Does he not exercise, cook, do any chores?  I guess money can help with a lot of things but he shouldn\u2019t be neglecting his child.", "Husband sounds like a loser.", "Very good summary. One more red flag to add:\n- Rolling eyes is dismissive and disrespectful. It is a sign of emotional abuse. \n\nBesides that, OP behavior is very immature. He doesn\u2019t seem to be ready for having a child or a family.", "This. \\^", "Why not kick him out and let her stay? NTA.", "Thinking that he would know his friend was going to cheat is a stretch. We don't know that he's turned a blind eye to it either. He may have given his friend hell but decided that people are human and flawed and he's not going to throw away the friendship over this. We also don't know if it was a one night stand that he sincerely regrets or if it was an on-going affair, which could very easily make a difference in continuing a friendship.", "Yes and that partner wants to bring in a cheating a****** into the space. That partner now wants to kick out her friend, who he agreed to help out, in order to bring his cheating a****** friend back into the house. Then, instead of addressing the situation in private which he should have done, he tried to put his foot down in front of all of his friends, when he had no ground. His reputation isn't ruined, it's simply active. If he didn't want to be a masculated, then maybe he shouldn't have done a masculating things.", "If you would read the actual post, her husband agreed to have her friend there. Now he's upset because he can't bring his cheating friend over. Then, he tried to pull weight that he doesn't have. He tried to act like a big shot in front of his friends, when he's doing absolutely nothing. All she did was make his reputation as a husband and father accurate. If he's embarrassed, it's because of his own actions.", "If my spouse is putting a cheater above not only helping my best friend which they agreed to, the best friend that got cheated on by their friend keep in mind, but above also helping out with the child that they helped create, and is barely helping provide, then I most definitely picking my best friend over my spouse. Because if my spouse is going to choose a cheater over making sure that the house is comfortable for everybody, then why would I want them? If my spouse is going to go back on their word of helping my friend, simply because they're cheating friend wants to come over, then I'm definitely picking my best friend. Because I don't want someone who's going to choose to be friends with people like that. \ud83e\udd37\ud83e\udd37", "Also, why should she have to tell her husband that she wants him more involved in the parenting when that should be something he's already instinctively doing? Why should we have to spell these things out for people? \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 That's allowing them to use their weaponized and competence against you. He knows damn well that he needs to be helping out more with the kid. He already knew that. He just chose not to address the situation. He chose to ignore it. Now that it's all out in the open for all of his friends to see, he is upset and hurt. And rightfully so. He decided to bring all this out in public, he doesn't get to be upset when his reputation is now accurate to the way he's actually acting.", "He did a fafo to try and dress you down in front of your friend and his friends wanting you to bend to his will.", "He also planted an anchor baby so OP would be more invested in the marriage. \n\nClearly this is a case of babies having babies.", "Right? She seems to have a better relationship and frankly partnership with A than her spouse. The bar is very low for him and he\u2019s still way under it.", "Why would you stay friends with a cheater? The moment I hear a friend cheated, or something else morally fucked and it's confirmed they did in fact do it, I drop them. It's really not that hard", "I don\u2019t see that anyone is?", "Yes? As you said, he\u2019s her partner - meaning it should be a partnership, where they help each other. She does the majority of their *shared* responsibilities by herself. At the VERY least, he needs to help take care of his own child after work. It\u2019s his responsibility, yet he\u2019s not doing it.\n\nAnd his partner IS working. She has a full-time 24 hour a day/7 days per week job of caretaker, housekeeper, chef, chauffeur, teacher, playmate, nurse, babysitter, and more. Plus, she never gets time off or vacation days from her job, but he does. It\u2019s naive & ignorant to insinuate that caring for a child is not work.", "Let him know that a cheater is not allowed to step foot inside the house that your father paid for. NTA", "You have to go by the behavior he is currently showing, you can not live in the past.", "Being an asshole is being an asshole, even when you're being an asshole to an asshole.", "I don't know, if my husband was telling me that the choice was between his cheating friend and my best friend, both my husband and his cheating friend would be out of my house. I don't really care how close of a friend he is to that cheating a******, that cheating a****** will not be in my house. And since that kind of decision is a two yes's one no kind of situation, guess cheating friend doesn't ever come back over. Because I would not feel comfortable with somebody like that in my house. Especially somebody who can't own up to the consequences of their actions.", "This. They only met a few years ago but are already married with a baby in tow. Which he seems to do nothing for. Sounds like he managed to tie her down before she got to see his true colours. I hope she sees that she deserves so much better.\n\nYou can't be out every single night with friends when you have a newborn at home - your baby and partner need you. The man is neglecting his  parenting responsibilities then getting mad that A is stepping in to hell his poor wife.", "Just so you know, this term usually refers to a non-citizen having a baby in a country so that the child has citizenship and immigration authorities are less likely (in theory) to remove the parent out of compassion for the relationship and the well-being of the citizen child. It's a racially and politically loaded term, so I thought you might want to know.", "It certainly wasn't because he loves or respects her, given the fight he chose to pick.", "Exactly. I don't subscribe to the \"if you don't shun a cheater INSTANTLY you're just as bad!!!\" scarlet letter mentality that some on Reddit do. **But** you still need to be real about the fact that your cheating ass friend is the guilty party, and as such, they don't get to hang out in the house where *the person they cheated on* is living to get away from them.", "He should be able to have his best friend over.", "I\u2019m not dropping my best friend since I was 2 who has been there for me through everything. I care about my best friend more than I care about their partner.", "Also she is financially contributing (via wealthy parents), so the husband is not single handedly supporting the family. NTA. Hubby can step up or move in with A\u2019s ex.", "Really?! If he is sleep deprived it's by his own design. I have young kids and the exact same work hours. Those are no excuse for being shitty.", "Well maybe he shouldn't have tried to pull weight and put her in her place in front of all of his friends. He had no weight to try and pull, and yet he tried to anyways. Play stupid games win stupid prizes.", "Was this reply meant for me? Because if anything, it seems like we agree. \n\nOP is NTA, the fact she went off topic doesn't make it E.S.H. Friend felt uncomfortable and left, most likely because of the husband. Not what OP said", "He's only unhappy about it because now he can't bring his cheating friend over. He had no issues with it up until then. \ud83e\udd37\ud83e\udd37 He literally said that that was the reason that he's upset she's there. Is because he wants to bring his cheating friend over.", "No, he deliberately asked if that girl was going to always be around BECAUSE he wanted to bring his friend over. The friend who cheated on his wife's best friend. Why would you think that's an acceptable thing to ask your partner about? To bring your cheating friend over when their best friend who your friend cheated on is currently staying, which you agreed to.", "Well if you're not being a good provider, and you are not helping raise your child, then you don't deserve the respect of those positions. \ud83e\udd37\ud83e\udd37", "I think him having his friends around every day until 8 pm with a young baby is reason enough to dump him, and that was not even the thing OP is complaining about. That behaviour is not healthy & OP now gets no help as her friend was told to leave. OP's hubby & his friends sound so toxic. His eye-rolling would make me so angry.", "Then you\u2019re just as bad as a cheater", "A is looking after their child more than he is. If he wants her out, he needs to pick up the slack and stop hanging with his friends all night every night.", "A is the victim and is taking care of HIS kid. Imagine trying to justify shunning the victim over the cheater wtf", "Would you drop them if they murdered someone \ud83e\udd28\n\nGenuine question bc I always see people saying you should stick by your long time friends side no matter what. What is the line you draw? What if your friend screwed your partner behind your back? Your sister? Your mom? Is it only an issue if it affects you? Would you care if they kicked puppies? What about if they hit their wife? You'd be okay with them cheating on their wife but what if they physically hurt her?", "I have this theory that, unfortunately, a lot of people have kids due to societal brainwashing and not out of a genuine desire to raise a human. It's not until far too late that they think \"oh shit, I don't want this\" and try to dump the responsibility onto someone else...that someone else being the other parent, usually.", "He brings shitty attitudes about interpersonal relationships (daily 4 hour hangout with buddies while not parenting, being totally cool with cheaters, treating his partner so dismissively)\n\nShe can divorce his ass and he can still keep working his oh-so-important job & contributing in that way, without the hassle of pretending that \"it's fine that he wants to drink & hang instead of being a father\", & then I guess we'll see how much parenting/custody time he shows up for, to address the rest.", "We can all only go from what the op stated in her post. And I deffo got the vibe he does nothing, she stated he doesn\u2019t help with the baby. Also stated her father helps them out, if he\u2019s as wealthy as she says and he bought them a house, then I think we can deduce he\u2019s generous in daily life.", "That\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not losing my best friend that I\u2019ve had since I was 2 over something like that.", "Haven\u2019t had a problem thus far", "Ok", "I wouldn\u2019t be concerned about A over my best friend", "Honestly, I wouldn't even call this a theory with how common it is. Especially when you constantly have people saying you *have* to want romance and the white picket fence mentality otherwise you're sad and lonely. \n\nWith how often I've been asked when I'll get a bf by my aunt and when I tell them I don't want to date or get married they always say \"you're young, you'll eventually want to.

Also please point to the sentence in the post that the husband is drinking? Nowhere does she mention that\u2019s what him and his friends are doing so again another conclusion you\u2019re drawing off nothing.  \n\nAnd because his friend cheated he is no longer allowed to be his friend? Lol \n\nI love how a simple question from this woman about one argument has led to people to draw conclusions that he\u2019s a shitty dad, husband, alcoholic and a loser.
