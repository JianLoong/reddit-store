So all of my husband\u2019s friends are also my friends and all my friends are his friends.\n\nI\u2019ve know my best friend (A) for 15 years, we\u2019ve always been extremely close and lived together at one point, she\u2019s literally part of my family, she comes to all of my family events, my siblings refer to her as their sister and she just been extremely involved in my life for years.\nNow, me and my husband have a 6 month old daughter. My dad is extremely wealthy so he helps us out financially until my daughter is old enough to go to school, then i will take a job at his company that pays well. My husband has a job that he works from 7am - 4 pm and then afterwards him and his friends often hangout at my house or at one of their house\u2019s. \n\nHere\u2019s the problem, my husband\u2019s best friend cheated on my best friend a few weeks ago, she\u2019s completely heartbroken and since they lived together my husband and i agreed that it\u2019s okay that she stays with us until they work things out. She\u2019s not really up to seeing him just yet. A is a huge help with the baby, she\u2019s so good with her and the baby loves her. When my husband and his friends get home they normally talk until 8 pm ish so he doesn\u2019t help with the baby too much when he gets home, which i don\u2019t mind it\u2019s just nice to have a little help. Yesterday night my husband opened the front door , peaked his head in, looked right at me and A , rolled his eyes and walked out. Him and his friends came in a few moments later and were all being cold and rude to A all evening. After an hour or two my husband walks right up to me and A and says \u201cdoes she always have to be here? I want to bring (friends name) here tonight.\u201d And rolled his eyes, i responded \u201cif i want to bring my best friend into the house my dad paid for, i can, and if i choose to have somebody help me with the baby that you\u2019re not looking after, it\u2019s going to be her.\u201d His friends just sat there silently and he just walked away and sat back down . He\u2019s giving me the silent treatment and A left and is staying with her mom as she feels uncomfortable being in the house now.

You say that your friend groups have joined. So your husband, father of a young child, has to hang out with his buddies for hours every day? He should be helping raise his child. Being a parent doesn\u2019t mean no more friends, but he still needs to raise his child. It is pretty clear that his issue with A being there isn\u2019t so much that you have a friend there. You have the person that his buddy cheated on there. How can his buddy that cheated feel comfortable with that? Because his friends are the priority. Although you weren\u2019t great with the comment about you can have who you want in the house your dad paid for. I\u2019m sure all your friends already know it, but it\u2019s still not a great statement. None of you, except A, come across well in this. Yes, you\u2019re raising your infant child, but you have to rely on your father\u2019s support. You\u2019re relying on your friend to help care for your child. What part is your husband playing? I suspect that A might be reevaluating her life while she is staying with her mother. I would if I realized I was staying with a friend, caring for her child, in the house her daddy paid for while her husband was whining that my being their was infringing on his hours of bro time with the guy that cheated on me.

You might have a deeper problem. It would be wise to address it", "ESH\n\nSounds like you said that to your husband out of spite because he doesn't help as much. You don't get to make the rules of your marriage in a house that doesn't belong to either one of you but your dad. \n\nYour husband should've talked to you in private about A. He didn't need to say anything right in front of her and make her uncomfortable.", "ESH. He is for obvious reasons, so are his friends. You went for the attack when provoked, which I kinda get, but it wasn't even based on the same topic. He brought up A being there and him wanting to have his cheating friend over, you didn't shut this down or made the boundry clear, but went for the: my daddy pays for everything and you suck as a dad. That is not fair to A either because you just put her in the middle in a much bigger fight within your relationship, which had nothing to do with her! \n\nSo yeah, the only non AH is A who got mistreated by her husband, her best friend and her best friends husband and in front of even more of her friends, who made it clear they are on her husbands side in this! No wonder she left after this!\n\nEdit: Dear downvoters, really?! Read the post again and put yourself in As shoes and think if maybe you would be kinda mad at your friend for this, because I am sure most of you would be! I'd be really interested in your reasonings, but this being reddit, it's probably well the guy was a dick first so OP was right to be a dick back without any concern for the person this fight was originally about and has enough on her plate already", "ESH.", "ESH.

You can totally have a rational conversation about family time, without saving it to throw on a burn pile of grievances. This is really passive aggressive, and immature behavior. \n\nLastly, obviously don't manufacture situations where you loudly and publicly choose your friend over your spouse.\n\nEven if she is like a sister to you, anyone would know that putting a sibling ahead of their spouse is bound to be needlessly hurtful.

Most partners will need maybe a half hour/hour cooling down period when they get home if their day is stressful, but him coming home with a group of people, invading your home with that social group like you guys don't have a kid or responsibilities tells me (and should tell you) that he's not in a parent state of mind. He's still living the single life in his head, which is why he thinks it's okay to bring his cheating best friend into your home at all, let alone while the person he cheated on is there - and making herself useful by keeping you company and helping out with HIS baby. \n\nYour husband is not pulling his weight at all.

While cheating is terrible, it's also a very individual case each time. Sometimes it was a one time mistake or just not true Love or the relationship already over just not officially broken up yet, often it's also just one selfish asshole, but that is different from case to case. \nI find americans in that regard much worse to break with a friend because 'they don't want to be associated with them'.
