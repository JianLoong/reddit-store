It confuses some people so I wanted to bring that up. I\u2019m a guy and I wear makeup sometimes which they don\u2019t like and don\u2019t want me doing if I\u2019m babysitting for them. That\u2019s never been an issue for me.\n\nRecently my bf paid for me to get my nails done since I can never excuse buying something like that for myself. It\u2019s just a design of No Face from Spirited Away, which is one of my favourite movies. They\u2019re not long.\n\nMy bio dad texted me asking me on pretty short notice to babysit for a full day (11am to 10pm). I agreed but then he said he saw my post and I\u2019d have to clean off the nails. I told him that I wasn\u2019t going to do that, and then he said I couldn\u2019t babysit. That was how we left it until he calls me on the day of asking me why I\u2019m late. I show up, he doesn\u2019t say anything about the nails, but then when they come back, he noticed them and told me I completely disrespected him and that he wasn\u2019t going to pay me. I told him I hadn\u2019t hid them and I thought he had just gotten over it because he didn\u2019t say anything. He said that he wasn\u2019t looking at my nails and assumed I had been \u201creasonable\u201d and gotten rid of them.\n\nIt\u2019s a day later and I\u2019m still pissed about this. The more I think about it, the more upset I am. I get it was stupid for me to think he\u2019d just decided he didn\u2019t care but I guess I thought since they couldn\u2019t find anybody else they were just desperate. I never said anything to make him think I\u2019d gotten rid of them. I guess he also never said anything that should have made me think he\u2019d gotten over it. But to not pay me when I put the same amount of work in that I would have done without the nails is crazy. They didn\u2019t get in the way of anything. You can probably tell I more think he\u2019s the asshole here, but I want to get over this and stop being so upset. I feel like any feedback on this situation would help so, who\u2019s the asshole?", "created_utc": 1673314043, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/107wkwt/aita_for_babysitting_with_nail_polish_on/", "score": 117, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
