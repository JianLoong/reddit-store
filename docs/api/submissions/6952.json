It confuses some people so I wanted to bring that up. I\u2019m a guy and I wear makeup sometimes which they don\u2019t like and don\u2019t want me doing if I\u2019m babysitting for them. That\u2019s never been an issue for me.\n\nRecently my bf paid for me to get my nails done since I can never excuse buying something like that for myself. It\u2019s just a design of No Face from Spirited Away, which is one of my favourite movies. They\u2019re not long.\n\nMy bio dad texted me asking me on pretty short notice to babysit for a full day (11am to 10pm). I agreed but then he said he saw my post and I\u2019d have to clean off the nails. I told him that I wasn\u2019t going to do that, and then he said I couldn\u2019t babysit. That was how we left it until he calls me on the day of asking me why I\u2019m late. I show up, he doesn\u2019t say anything about the nails, but then when they come back, he noticed them and told me I completely disrespected him and that he wasn\u2019t going to pay me. I told him I hadn\u2019t hid them and I thought he had just gotten over it because he didn\u2019t say anything. He said that he wasn\u2019t looking at my nails and assumed I had been \u201creasonable\u201d and gotten rid of them.\n\nIt\u2019s a day later and I\u2019m still pissed about this. The more I think about it, the more upset I am. I get it was stupid for me to think he\u2019d just decided he didn\u2019t care but I guess I thought since they couldn\u2019t find anybody else they were just desperate. I never said anything to make him think I\u2019d gotten rid of them. I guess he also never said anything that should have made me think he\u2019d gotten over it. But to not pay me when I put the same amount of work in that I would have done without the nails is crazy. They didn\u2019t get in the way of anything. You can probably tell I more think he\u2019s the asshole here, but I want to get over this and stop being so upset. I feel like any feedback on this situation would help so, who\u2019s the asshole?", "created_utc": 1673314043, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/107wkwt/aita_for_babysitting_with_nail_polish_on/", "score": 452, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I wouldn't have gotten rid of them either, unless he payed me for babysitting and to have my nails redone on top of my hourly rate. \n\nYou should start charging him an AH tax, if you choose to babysit again.", "You just paid a day's wage for a big lesson: Do not let the homophobes bully you. If their straight money isn't good enough for your gay labor, THEN DON'T WORK FOR THEM. Let this be a lesson learned and move on. You're NTA, but you will be (towards yourself) if you allow him to bully you any further. Take care of you.\n\nSigned, your lesbian godmother for the day.\n\nEdit: can you also give my love to your boyfriend for getting you those awesome nails?", "NTA he automatically thought he had enough control over you for you to just clean off your nails without him saying anymore and was annoyed when he found that wasn't the case. He's the AH here, not you. They're just nails and it's your body at the end of the day anyway. jeez. Edit: not to mention the fact he just expects you to be available to babysit last minute, didn't confirm it was still going ahead and then, when you've basically done him a favour, he refused to pay you.", "NTA. But don him in to your grandparents or aunts / uncles on his side. Tell them he asked you to babysit for 12+ hours at the last minute- which you did  - then he refused to pay you the agreed upon amount. Put it on social media too, and tag all the rellies. Name and shame. And never help him out again.", "Oh, sweetie, you are 100% NTA and you were robbed by your bio dad.\n\nHe refused to pay you for work done, 11 hours of work!\n\nHe had a fit because you refused to remove a custom nail job and didn't pay you for 11 hours of completed work.\n\nHe accused you of being disrespectful and unreasonable for not destroying a gift your boyfriend gave you.\n\nGonna go out on a limb here and guess he's homophobic.\n\nEdit to add: btw your nails sound adorable. No Face is also one of my favorites.", "NTA, why do you help him out when he treats you like this? If you were a woman, he wouldn't even comment about your nails, which sounds awesome, btw love spirited away I'd tell him to find an actual sitter from now on which he will struggle on rhat short notice and forget them since they don't show you any kind of respect anyway", "I'd tell him to do one. I wouldn't be doing it anymore. Good luck finding a sitter that short notice", "I feel it would be healthier in the long run for you to go no contact with him. He isnt going to change", "The saddest and most frustrating part is that he probably thinks this *is* caring for you by teaching you \u201crespect\u201d and to \u201cbe a man\u201d. But all he\u2019s really teaching you is that your father doesn\u2019t respect *you* and that his concept of \u201cbeing a man\u201d is a pathetic m, antiquated joke. \n\nDon\u2019t let him get to you. Stay true to yourself. Remember, *you* hold the cards here because he relies on you to babysit, but it doesn\u2019t sound like you really need anything from him. I would let him know that you won\u2019t be babysitting again until you get paid, that any potential future babysitting will be paid up front, and that your clothing, hair, nails, and makeup are not up for discussion. If you feel like wearing makeup that day then you rock that makeup! If he doesn\u2019t like it, then he can find another babysitter because you have better things to do.", "I'm so sorry. No kid should go through that. I think it would be better to cut him out now instead of going through neverending heartache", "NTA do not babysit again he is trying to exert control over you.", "NTA. There is nothing wrong with you wearing nail polish. Nothing wrong with you wearing make up either. Nor is there anything wrong with you wearing a mini skirt with knee high boots and a low cut top. It doesn\u2019t meant you will do any less of a job with the baby. He is just trying to control you into being what HE thinks you should be. Stand firm. Be yourself. You don\u2019t love any different just because you choose to be physically different than others.", "NTA but you should be around people who like you, your bio dad only seems to want you around if you change and do him a favour. You should stop babysitting, if he asks you again and you wanted to, explain you will need him to send payment for the baby sitting he stiffed you on and to pay upfront for this time. What are you getting from this relationship though? Is it worth it", "NTA, he is just trying to weasel out of paying you. Next time they are desperate for a sitter, don\u2019t do it unless they pay you for the last visit (plus a monthly surcharge for non-payment) and pay you in advance for the next sit.", "You got played by your dad...NTA....\n\nBut your dad is a dick", "NTA. I'd take him to small claims court but I'm petty", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry you ended up related to a homophobe. \n\nYour nails sound great, and appropriate for babysitting. \n\nMakeup, cosmetics, painted nails - they are becoming more and more gender-neutral.\n\nAnyone who had MTV in the 80s saw long, teased hair, makeup, manicures, jewelry, etc. and should have been desensitized to it all. Same with professional wrestling.", "NTA", "For sure NTA.  For sure don\u2019t babysit for them again.. unless they provide the payment owed BEFORE they head out.  And honestly, always payment up front from now on as clearly they are assholes.  The whole thing over nail polish.. cuz nail polish is the highway to hell?  Ugh, they need to get over it.", "NTA your Dad\u2019s a dick.", "If he didn't pay you then next time say no. That's it...take this one as a lose. And don't babysit. It's their kid, let them figure it out", "NTA Let him know that you will not be babysitting again until you are paid and also your rates just increased.", "NTA, he owes you now for the babysitting and feel free to never babysit again as he broke your trust. What an AH.", ">When he asks you again tell him he has to pay you for the previous time AND pay in advance for that night.\n\nIf OP does this he should wait to tell him until it's time to start babysitting. Last time Dad obviously tried to find another sitter and couldn't, so his fair options would have been to pay OP or cancel his plans last minute. Don't give him another chance to look for an alternative, wait until deciding not to pay will cause him the same inconvenience he would have had if he had been honest about not intending to pay on the original day.\n\nPersonally I think I would just not babysit for them anymore.", "Screw that.  Double time for unpaid shifts.", "NTA at all. \n\nBut for future reference, it\u2019s worth being up front with things like this. \n\nDad: why are you late?\n\nYou: because you said you didn\u2019t want me to babysit \n\nDad: no I demanded you clean your nails & still babysit\n\nYou: sorry that\u2019s not an option. I\u2019m keeping the nails on. Did you still want me to come & babysit? I don\u2019t mind if you say yes or no. \n\nDad: (has to make a decision - be reasonable or get no babysitting, or maybe throw a tantrum to try to still bully you into doing things his way.. you can\u2019t control his behaviour choices, only how you respond & what you put up with - eg tantrum gets a \u201csorry you feel that way. I\u2019m going to hang up the phone now.\u201d)\n\nI get that in the moment you didn\u2019t register this was an option (because relationships with our parents take a while to figure out in early adulthood) - but hopefully you can see that you have this power for similar situations in the future. \n\nIt\u2019s called \u201cboundaries\u201d and is a useful skill to learn, especially when your parents have a habit of crossing them without permission.", "But inform him that you won't  babysit anymore due to him breaking  his word  by not paying  last time and not bother calling you again  to babysit.  Nta", "NTA. Tell him \"you thought he came to his senses and realised that he had no say on what anyone else did and that his son being looked after was more important than his hang ups.\"\n\nThen stop babysitting for the judgemental idiot. Tell him you'll consider helping again after he apologizes and pays you what you're owed.", "NTA - I personally think he knew before leaving that you hadn't acquiesced his request but he couldn't find anyone else so he decided to \"teach you a lesson\" by refusing to pay you after the fact", "NTA. I\u2019m petty enough that I\u2019d spend $100 to file a small claims case against him, then never speak to him again.", "NTA After this you may want to ask for payment up front if you decide to babysit again. Your dad is an AH for not paying you. He is a thief. He stole your time, and effort. He is totally wrong. As Judge Judy would say \"You ate the steak\". Meaning he received the product, consumed the product, and refuses to pay for it. That is stealing.\n\nIt might be worth considering going NC. He has shown he does not respect you.", "NTA \n\nIf he ever asks again, tell him that he has to pay upfront for the time he stiffed you AND the new occasion.", "NTA. Spirited Away is great, and I bet your nails are awesome. Be you. Don't change for a small minded person, even if that person is your dad.", "NTA. He is the only asshole here, not you. Nail polish doesn't affect your ability to care for a child in any way, shape or form. He is just being homophobic. Don't babysit for him ever, unless he pays you for wasting your time.", "You are right to be upset and I don\u2019t think you should just conform. Stand your ground or he\u2019s just going to continue to walk all over you.\n\nYou are definitely not the AH. Your farther is.", "NTA seems like he didn't say anything at the time so you would still babysit and then used the nails as an excuse not to pay you. i wouldn't babysit anymore", "NTA.  No more babysitting for them ever.", "I mean dad clearly knew and was looking to it pay anyway so waited till work was done", "Can we see the nails? \ud83e\udd13\u2764\ufe0f", "The way to get over it is to simply tell him that you will never babysit for him ever again unless he pays you for services rendered.  Also, but if I were you, I'd just take the money lost and never babysit for him again.  Consider it a graceful way to exit a toxic environment.", "NTA. He knew you didn't change them but still wanted a babysitter, so he ignored it until after he got back.", "NTA at all!! For him not to pay you is awful. What a shitty person, let alone father.", "NTA. Your bio Dad is the A. He should have paid you, as you did the work. \n\nIt would not be unreasonable to decline to babysit for him in the future, or until he pays you for this most recent babysitting.", "NTA.  I guess Bio-Dad will need to find a new babysitter going forward.", "NTA take them to small claims court to get your baby sitting money back.  It's what a standard baby sitter would do.

If you do get sucked into babysitting again for some reason insist on being paid at the beginning. Get him to Venmo the money or something before you even come to the house if you can.
