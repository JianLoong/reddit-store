He often jokes that I\u2019m ugly/makes fun of my looks and called me a \u201cWalmart [*some actress whose name I forgot*]\u201d  last time we met. He only picks on me even tho I\u2019ve not mistreated him at all (and before you say it\u2026no he does *NOT* like me). It upset me but I\u2019m non confrontational so just brushed his comments off. (And no one told him to cut it out either. When I voiced my concern to the group they said that he\u2019s obviously not being serious. Well to me it WAS serious). \n\nAs a result me and the girls started excluding him from everything. \n\nWell a few days ago I found out that he was adopted as a baby and that his mom is an awful, awful narcissist. That same evening he knocked on our door and asked to speak with me privately. Naturally I declined. I told him that he\u2019s such an asshole even his biological parents couldn\u2019t stand him. I also added that he clearly took after his mom in terms of personality. \n\nAfter this incident I was labeled an AH by some people (mostly the guys).

Yeah, it was WAAAAAY harsh but you provided him with an opportunity to change and grow. Insulting people and using admittedly shitty circumstances to excuse it just lets him continue to be a shitty person. \n\nHe gave you a \"I'm sorry but...\" which isn't a real apology or marker of growth. He was making an excuse and you didn't take it. Instead you gave him what he was giving you. Seems fair to me.", "NTA.

Which he surely will.", "NTA, I do not care that what you said was harsh. He likely WAS repeating his adopted moms behavior and you're not required to protect the feelings of someone who intentionally hurt you over and over. Was the \"your parents didn't even want you\" thing a bit much? Definitely, but like..... don't start shit if you can't handle it", "NTA.  Sounds like he deserved what he got.

He is finding out now that there are consequences, let him learn.", "NTA. Brutal, but NTA. He thought you were an easy target, and damn, did he learn differently. Glass houses and all that.

They don\u2019t sound like very good friends to me.\n\nBut to weaponize his adoption trauma???  That was incredibly cruel.  You didn\u2019t just sink to his level, but went even further and very clearly chose the worst thing to say in order to hurt him as much as possible.

If this was a one time comment to which OP responded with her comments, then it would have been too much. \n\nAfter repeated offenses from him, I think she was justified in responding with the same level of disregard for her feelings he has shown.

They were never your friends", "I'm going to say YTA, even though he deserved to suffer some blowback for his poor behavior.  Going nuclear was not the best way to handle yourself. I understand how you got there, and so do you. Bottling up your emotions until they explode will not work for you in the long run.  You will be judged negatively for it and it stands in the way of having healthy relationships.\n\nTry to think of this as a learning experience.

I will say soft YTA. Throwing the bio parents in was over the line.", "ESH. He was a massive AH to you and you did not have to talk to him, but saying what you did just made you the same as him.

To bring up childhood trauma is another level of AH-ness\n\nHe still sucks as there is no excuse for targeting innocent people for bullying regardless of how rough your background is", "Hmmm . . . \n\nI don't know what his motives are in speaking to you privately. Maybe he wanted to apologize? I guess we'll never know. You certainly don't owe private audience to someone who's treating you like shit.\n\nOn the other hand, if he's truly sorry for what he did, then he can apologize publicly. He committed the offenses publicly, he can own up to it publicly.\n\nAs for your response, I agree, it was over-the-top savage. But then again, he picked this fight; you had the right to decide the gloves will come off. And with his history, it's just too easy.\n\nI think the problem here rests in this statement:\n\n>It upset me but I\u2019m non confrontational so just brushed his comments off.\n\nYou need to revise how you think about yourself. Because every time I hear the word \"nonconfrontational\" in this sub, my default assumption is, \"doormat who's too cowardly to stand up for herself.\"\n\nInstead of telling him to knock it off, you complained to the group.\n\nRegarding this:\n\n>After this incident I was labeled an AH by some people (mostly the guys). Apparently I went from 0-100 with my response and that it was far more savage/toxic than what he said to me all this time.\n\nWould these people who accused you of being \"savage/toxic\" be the same people who dismissed his rude comments as \"not being serious\"?\n\nPretty convenient how the guys will dismiss boorish, cruel comments coming from a guy, then whine about how a girl is \"savage/toxic\" when she defends herself.\n\nI've decided I'm going to go NTA. Mostly because the friend circle should have collectively told him to knock it off, not dismissed his rude comments. They should have made it clear that bullying is not acceptable, and that's what he was doing. And they should not have dismissed your feelings about it either. They basically told you that you were wrong to be offended.\n\nAlso, even though I'm a guy myself, I don't think it's fair for a guy to judge how cruel it is to call someone \"ugly\" when the target is a girl.\n\nBecause let's face it, when it comes to finding life partners, a guy's market value isn't so much about his looks. With girls, it's different. It's very much about looks. Calling a girl ugly is essentially telling her that no high-value guy will ever want her.\n\nI'm very glad that the girls are standing up for you, at least.", "NTA. He obviously did learn from his mother how to treat people. There's zero excuse for him to be so rude to you without any provocation. You, on the other hand, had plenty of reason to tell him how you feel about him.", "NTA. He asked for it.", "[deleted]", "I think that his humor was being really misread and he was definitely being too mean while at the same time you took it to a whole other level. Messing with someone based on dumb celebrity jokes is very different than finding something deeply personal and using it to bring them down. \n\nHe knocked on the door and asked to speak to you privately, that could\u2019ve been about anything. Very likely it could\u2019ve been an apology but also as likely that it wasn\u2019t going to be. \n\nESH", "ESH. It wasn\u2019t okay for him to be insulting you but it\u2019s not okay to give such a personal insult back. If you had just cut him out and not talked to him after he was awful to you then you would be NTA but what you said to him was really nasty.", "YTA. An easy rejection will sting enough for dudes that you didn\u2019t have to go nuclear on the dude. Your response was totally unnecessary and uncalled for", "If you have to ask, then yes, YTA.\n\nThose things aren't yours to comment on. They're far more hurtful than his (inexcusable) comments. You owe him a big apology. Don't swat a gnat with a nuclear bomb.", "YTA Someone else said it better than me by saying you would have been N T A if you had just excluded him and not wanted to hear his explanations/apologies/whatever he was there to do. But you went straight for the killing blow with the comments about his parents. Nasty, nasty, nasty. Made me go from N T A to YTA, it was that bad.", "YTA, that is the cruelest thing you could possibly say to someone who's adopted. Amazing that you managed to make yourself the bad guy in this scenario, but you did.", "ESH both of you attack each other.", "I mean, yeah. ESH, he was being a dick but that was way, way, over the line. What if he had went home and harmed himself?", "ESH but double for OP. You couldn\u2019t at least hear him out? Maybe he was going to apologize or maybe he was going to ask for help. I understand your immediate reaction but you knew his background and he obviously had issues. Would be nice if you offered him an olive branch\u2026", "YTA\n\nYou need to understand a graded response.  Your own fear of reasonable confrontation has lead to you going for the most hurtful thing you could say.\n\nInstead of causes yourself a 0.5/10 level discomfort by confronting him when he first started, you let it build and build until you decided to give him a 10/10 pain to release your own discomfort.\n\nThat\u2019s messed up, and is a sign of an emotionally immature person, and frankly a selfish person.", "Haha\n\nESH but lmao yessss queen you're the cool one", "YTA but mostly because your friends will take the side of whoever got hurt worse in an argument. Even if friends tell you it was justified, hitting below the belt like that makes the whole group see you in a different light. This is because everyone now knows that something superficial (like looks) was escalated into attacks on someone\u2019s deepest insecurities and abandonment. He probably won\u2019t grow from this, instead he\u2019ll have a reason to hate you and his picking on you is justified by your escalation. \nHe did totally deserve it, but most likely this has worse consequences for you because now your friends will know that you\u2019re capable of hurting them in incredibly deep ways over superficial things.\nFinally, brushing off peoples comments just to later blow up about them won\u2019t get people to stop picking on you it\u2019ll just isolate you. I really feel for you and I\u2019m sorry this happened.
