He only picks on me even tho I\u2019ve not mistreated him at all (and before you say it\u2026no he does *NOT* like me). It upset me but I\u2019m non confrontational so just brushed his comments off. (And no one told him to cut it out either. When I voiced my concern to the group they said that he\u2019s obviously not being serious. Well to me it WAS serious). \n\nAs a result me and the girls started excluding him from everything. \n\nWell a few days ago I found out that he was adopted as a baby and that his mom is an awful, awful narcissist. That same evening he knocked on our door and asked to speak with me privately. Naturally I declined. I told him that he\u2019s such an asshole even his biological parents couldn\u2019t stand him. I also added that he clearly took after his mom in terms of personality. \n\nAfter this incident I was labeled an AH by some people (mostly the guys).

Yeah, it was WAAAAAY harsh but you provided him with an opportunity to change and grow. Insulting people and using admittedly shitty circumstances to excuse it just lets him continue to be a shitty person. \n\nHe gave you a \"I'm sorry but...\" which isn't a real apology or marker of growth. He was making an excuse and you didn't take it. Instead you gave him what he was giving you. Seems fair to me.", "NTA.

Which he surely will.", "NTA, I do not care that what you said was harsh. He likely WAS repeating his adopted moms behavior and you're not required to protect the feelings of someone who intentionally hurt you over and over. Was the \"your parents didn't even want you\" thing a bit much? Definitely, but like..... don't start shit if you can't handle it", "NTA.  Sounds like he deserved what he got.

He is finding out now that there are consequences, let him learn.", "NTA. Brutal, but NTA. He thought you were an easy target, and damn, did he learn differently. Glass houses and all that.

They don\u2019t sound like very good friends to me.\n\nBut to weaponize his adoption trauma???  That was incredibly cruel.  You didn\u2019t just sink to his level, but went even further and very clearly chose the worst thing to say in order to hurt him as much as possible.

They were never your friends", "I'm going to say YTA, even though he deserved to suffer some blowback for his poor behavior.  Going nuclear was not the best way to handle yourself.

You will be judged negatively for it and it stands in the way of having healthy relationships.\n\nTry to think of this as a learning experience.

I will say soft YTA. Throwing the bio parents in was over the line.", "ESH. He was a massive AH to you and you did not have to talk to him, but saying what you did just made you the same as him.

To bring up childhood trauma is another level of AH-ness\n\nHe still sucks as there is no excuse for targeting innocent people for bullying regardless of how rough your background is", "Hmmm . . . \n\nI don't know what his motives are in speaking to you privately. Maybe he wanted to apologize? I guess we'll never know. You certainly don't owe private audience to someone who's treating you like shit.\n\nOn the other hand, if he's truly sorry for what he did, then he can apologize publicly. He committed the offenses publicly, he can own up to it publicly.\n\nAs for your response, I agree, it was over-the-top savage. But then again, he picked this fight; you had the right to decide the gloves will come off. And with his history, it's just too easy.\n\nI think the problem here rests in this statement:\n\n>It upset me but I\u2019m non confrontational so just brushed his comments off.\n\nYou need to revise how you think about yourself. Because every time I hear the word \"nonconfrontational\" in this sub, my default assumption is, \"doormat who's too cowardly to stand up for herself.\"\n\nInstead of telling him to knock it off, you complained to the group.\n\nRegarding this:\n\n>After this incident I was labeled an AH by some people (mostly the guys). Apparently I went from 0-100 with my response and that it was far more savage/toxic than what he said to me all this time.\n\nWould these people who accused you of being \"savage/toxic\" be the same people who dismissed his rude comments as \"not being serious\"?\n\nPretty convenient how the guys will dismiss boorish, cruel comments coming from a guy, then whine about how a girl is \"savage/toxic\" when she defends herself.\n\nI've decided I'm going to go NTA. Mostly because the friend circle should have collectively told him to knock it off, not dismissed his rude comments. They should have made it clear that bullying is not acceptable, and that's what he was doing. And they should not have dismissed your feelings about it either. They basically told you that you were wrong to be offended.\n\nAlso, even though I'm a guy myself, I don't think it's fair for a guy to judge how cruel it is to call someone \"ugly\" when the target is a girl.\n\nBecause let's face it, when it comes to finding life partners, a guy's market value isn't so much about his looks. With girls, it's different. It's very much about looks. Calling a girl ugly is essentially telling her that no high-value guy will ever want her.\n\nI'm very glad that the girls are standing up for you, at least.", "NTA. He obviously did learn from his mother how to treat people. There's zero excuse for him to be so rude to you without any provocation. You, on the other hand, had plenty of reason to tell him how you feel about him.", "NTA. He asked for it.", "[deleted]", "I think that his humor was being really misread and he was definitely being too mean while at the same time you took it to a whole other level. Messing with someone based on dumb celebrity jokes is very different than finding something deeply personal and using it to bring them down. \n\nHe knocked on the door and asked to speak to you privately, that could\u2019ve been about anything. Very likely it could\u2019ve been an apology but also as likely that it wasn\u2019t going to be. \n\nESH", "ESH. It wasn\u2019t okay for him to be insulting you but it\u2019s not okay to give such a personal insult back.

An easy rejection will sting enough for dudes that you didn\u2019t have to go nuclear on the dude. Your response was totally unnecessary and uncalled for", "If you have to ask, then yes, YTA.\n\nThose things aren't yours to comment on. They're far more hurtful than his (inexcusable) comments. You owe him a big apology. Don't swat a gnat with a nuclear bomb.", "YTA Someone else said it better than me by saying you would have been N T A if you had just excluded him and not wanted to hear his explanations/apologies/whatever he was there to do. But you went straight for the killing blow with the comments about his parents. Nasty, nasty, nasty. Made me go from N T A to YTA, it was that bad.", "YTA, that is the cruelest thing you could possibly say to someone who's adopted. Amazing that you managed to make yourself the bad guy in this scenario, but you did.", "ESH both of you attack each other.", "I mean, yeah. ESH, he was being a dick but that was way, way, over the line. What if he had went home and harmed himself?", "ESH but double for OP. You couldn\u2019t at least hear him out? Maybe he was going to apologize or maybe he was going to ask for help. I understand your immediate reaction but you knew his background and he obviously had issues. Would be nice if you offered him an olive branch\u2026", "YTA\n\nYou need to understand a graded response.  Your own fear of reasonable confrontation has lead to you going for the most hurtful thing you could say.\n\nInstead of causes yourself a 0.5/10 level discomfort by confronting him when he first started, you let it build and build until you decided to give him a 10/10 pain to release your own discomfort.\n\nThat\u2019s messed up, and is a sign of an emotionally immature person, and frankly a selfish person.", "Haha\n\nESH but lmao yessss queen you're the cool one", "YTA but mostly because your friends will take the side of whoever got hurt worse in an argument. Even if friends tell you it was justified, hitting below the belt like that makes the whole group see you in a different light. This is because everyone now knows that something superficial (like looks) was escalated into attacks on someone\u2019s deepest insecurities and abandonment. He probably won\u2019t grow from this, instead he\u2019ll have a reason to hate you and his picking on you is justified by your escalation. \nHe did totally deserve it, but most likely this has worse consequences for you because now your friends will know that you\u2019re capable of hurting them in incredibly deep ways over superficial things.\nFinally, brushing off peoples comments just to later blow up about them won\u2019t get people to stop picking on you it\u2019ll just isolate you. I really feel for you and I\u2019m sorry this happened.

What she said was vicious, but it wasn\u2019t aimed at a saint, it was aimed at a prick who needs to realise he can\u2019t say awful things to people \u201cas a joke\u201d because it\u2019s not funny, and if anyone else laughed at that, OP needs to seriously reconsider her friend group. \n\nIt\u2019s a tough one, NTA because frankly he had it coming but ESH because despite being a prick, he doesn\u2019t get a say in what his family did when he was a child. OP could have just led with the personality statement and left it at that. You don\u2019t need the burn to leave only ashes, but really that comes with experience. Maybe you can both grow some from this.", "> I told him that he\u2019s such an asshole even his biological parents couldn\u2019t stand him. \n\nESH. What do you have against people who were adopted? This is like using a homophobic slur against a gay person because they personally wronged you. You are denigrating a whole group, it isn't about him, it's about what your insult means. It doesn't matter that he's an asshole, that doesn't justify you attacking other adopted people, which is what you are doing.", "ESH. It's been made clear in the comments why the guy was an AH, and I agree, so I'm not going to delve into that here. But in situations like this,\nwhere both parties have insulted each other, I\nwould say that the line distinguishing an AH action would be determined by the answer to the question: \n\"Is the insult directly relevant to the problem I have with them?\" \nFor example, for someone who doesn't like Trump, I would find insults based on his policies or the general ridiculousness of his statements to be justified, because his rhetoric actually harms people. Whereas insults about his appearance, such as his skin or hair or weight, are uncalled for. Even though he has done and said awful things, if the insult can be used towards someone else who isn't inherently perpetuating the same problem (for example, someone else could have a similar weight and promote the wellbeing of various marginalized communities), then it's unjustified. Even if it\u2019s a \u201clesser evil,\u201d that doesn\u2019t make it\u2019s good. \n\nSimilarly, I think that OP was an AH in this case\nnot because she spoke up for herself late, and not even because she didn't accept his (possible) attempt at an apology. It's because of the nature of her comment is not directly related to his name-calling, but rather about him being adopted. Since the nature of that insult could theoretically apply to other adopted kids who may not have been rude to OP in that way, I think that comment was an AH move.", "My jaw dropped, not going to lie. Savage does not begin to describe you.\n\nNTA though.", "NTA, he got what he deserves. And I really don't understand people, who lives through something traumatic, and decides to be mean to others. Like, why not trying to make sure no one else will go through the same shit?", "Savage AF. But justified. Love it.", "where does that end though? \"He did it first\" is the kind of BS I expect to hear from a 6 year old, not 20 something's. This eye for an eye stuff is utter bullshit. They're both being assholes here to be honest, if she had had an adult conversation with him the first time he did it and said it wasn't ok then none of this would have happened IMO. And using his adoption against him is a total dick move\n\nBut he is also an asshole for doing it in the first place, and not being socially aware enough to realise it had gone way beyond a joke. Although of course if it was deliberate that changes the whole situation\n\nOf course there's lots of potential context we might not be aware of, and lots of the comments are pure assumptions about both people's movies, but based on just what the OP has said they're both the asshole here", "Seconding this. ESH.\n\nI don't think he deserved much grace, but she really went for the jugular and then curb stomped him. Not cool to talk about his family and being adopted, wtf.", "This.", "Nah. You're naive and trying to paint op negatively for finally defending herself.  Kick rocks.", "She handled it fine.  If you talk shit, be ready for anything that comes back.  Nothing is off limits- adopted, genetic conditions, looks, family, anything.  Fuck around and find out.", "Shut the fuck up, bully enabler. She did nothing wrong", "I don't thing the girlfriends are that much better. Fair enough, they're on her side now but where were they when all of this was going on? I can't imagine a scenario where I wouldn't have spoken up for my friend if this was happening to her, even when I was really young.", "Extremely fair comment", "Honestly, this is one of the best pieces of advice I've read on Reddit. This wasn't intended for me, but I'm going to take it and apply it to my life.", "I don't agree that him MAYBE wanting to apologize is any valid point to make here. What I do agree with is the ESH judgement. He was an awful raging AH, but OP saying something like that (especially when he had actually not said anything during that encounter) makes her stoop to the same level as a bully. Actively trying to belittle someone else isn't ok, using their trauma against them isn't ok. I would've had more empathy for it if he was currently bullying her, but saying such a thing as a reaction to asking to talk to her alone is just AH move.", ">But to weaponize his adoption trauma??? That was incredibly cruel. You didn\u2019t just sink to his level, but went even further and very clearly chose the worst thing to say in order to hurt him as much as possible. You were 100% justified to be angry at him, but you handled it like a mega AH.\n\nIf OP reads anything here, I hope it's this. ESH, but goddammit OP, you really fucked up. This is the kind of thing people like him become suicide risks over. It was entirely unnecessary. You don't know anything about his bio parents or situation other than the fact he's been abused his whole childhood. Were you? What's your reason for being so awful? Self reflect and then genuinely apologize and talk it out with him. You'll regret it later if you don't.", "I\u2019m with you here on the Everyone sucks big time. There\u2019s no justification for what either of them did. \n\nI don\u2019t think either owes the other an apology, though. OP made it clear she doesn\u2019t want contact. She dropped an atom bomb to make sure it stays that way. They\u2019re both horrible human beings.", "Agree. The \u201che can dish it out but can\u2019t take it\u201d comments are killing me. As someone who was adopted as an infant that is probably the worst insult someone could say to an adoptee. Calling someone ugly is mean, telling someone they were adopted because even their biological parents didn\u2019t want them is just cruel.", "Spot on", "Lol dude treats OP like garbage and you think its her responsibility to get him back included in the group\ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd", "> Hearing out the apology and just trying to move forward\n\nWhat apology are you talking about?", "I lost a 'friend' because I did a similar thing.  When couples split up he would make very inappropriate jokes and comments at their expense.\n\nHe split up with the love of his life, and I did the same to him, publicly. He left in tears, and 20 years later he still doesn't speak to me (we are part of the same friends group, we see each other a couple of times a year, he is now happily married to someone else).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you can't take it, don't be an arsehole to others. I still stand by what I said, and yes, I am okay if others do the same to me. I don't like it, but they are free to reciprocate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP is NTA here.", "Because they're misogynists?", "I think the other thing that concerns me is the other friends that defended him and told OP that he was \"just kidding\". Fuck that. If your friend is hurt, say something about it!", "NTA\n\nShe handled it just fine. She tried to get help because his abuse was relentless. She and a group of women did what they needed to do to stay safe when nobody took them seriously. Nobody said a word to him about backing off on any part of the abuse. They made it clear that they didn't care how upsetting it was to her. They made it clear that nobody was going to do anything about him.  They told her she was the problem and made it clear that she's disposable. \n\nHearing them out is not always the smartest thing to do. He wasn't genuinely sorry and felt entitled to treat her however he pleased. His social group backed him up. When the women in the social group saw that abusers were welcome, they knew they would be treated the same way and opted out. \n\nHe could have handled a sincere apology with a modicum of empathy. He could have texted or messaged to ask if she would be willing to meet so he could apologize in person. Instead, he door popped her where she lived. He surprised her in the place she retreats to when she needs to feel calm and safe. His lack of empathy was obvious, as was his agenda. \n\nShe didn't say what he constantly insulted her about, but it was bad enough that all the women in that social group chose to leave it because of that guy and because none of the men gave a shit whether the women felt safe. None of the men in the group have apologized to any of the women who left because they weren't safe. None of the men cared about how the women were doing. Whether OP was OK. \n\nThey took zero action until they thought she responded too harshly. Too harshly to being harangued and insulted every time she saw him? They don't like women calling anyone out on their behavior, they didn't like women voting with their feet, and they don't like women fighting back. They don't get a vote when they haven't done anything but enable this guy.\n\nThe asshole doesn't have a right to treat anyone this way. He kept it up for as long as he pleased. It didn't stop until OP and friends chose not to me around him and the friend group. He dished out whatever the fuck he felt like dishing out, clearly enjoyed upsetting OP, and had extensive fun at her expense. \n\nShe came at him fairly. The men would not  acknowledge any of the harm she suffered. She put up with enough shit from the guy and from all the men who dismissed her. She handled it well. He ran off and cried about her being mean, and that was unacceptable to the men. \n\nHe fucked around. He found out. He's TA.", "Yeah, the whole \"you didn't handle this maturely. ESH\" shit is dumb as hell. The OP attempted to do it maturely by excluding him and not involving him in plans. Then when he didn't like that, he wanted to confront OP about it and OP told him off.

OP lashed back at the guy who called her ugly in an even crueler response. The guy is definitely an AH and the correct response was to exclude him from the hangout. That hurt him and he probably was trying to reach out to try to get back \u201cin.\u201d He may or may not have tried to apologize. We don\u2019t know that. But the high road would have been to just say, sorry, I don\u2019t want people who insult me in my house. Period. No need to bring up the adoption. That was below the belt. I know people get unnecessarily mean when they are triggered and upset, but you don\u2019t hit below the belt. That is the way to determine the classy ones from the loudmouth AHs. So, I do think OP is an AH. At least she was in this instance. \n\nShe\u2019s young so It\u2019s a learning opportunity. If she wants to make herself NTA, OP should apologize to the guy and said she said it in the heat of the moment and in retaliation for calling her repeatedly ugly in front of everyone no less and in her home. And then say \u201cas a result I still don\u2019t want you coming back (unless this leads to a true recovery of the situation) but I am sorry for my insult.
