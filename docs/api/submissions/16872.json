Why would this even be a suggestion? Does he want house sitters for no real reason? It's your new house, you don't even have furniture yet. I doubt you'll be that far along with the house by the time you leave. NTA.\n\nAhh I see. They're offering to \"help\" with the house despite the fact that they never offered any help before and actually taken advantage of you multiple times. No.", "NTA. I don't even understand why someone would suggest this.", "INFO: it's really hard to say without knowing more about the in-laws. Are they generally decent, tidy people? Or are they a storm of destruction just one step ahead of catastrophe at all times? Why do they need to stay in your house at all? Are they getting evicted? Or is is it just to guard your house while it's empty? Do they live far away? Are they bringing five drooling dogs with them? \n\nWhy does your husband want them there while you're gone?\n\nEDIT: Oh, I see your additional post:\n\n>they expect to be waited and entertained when they're staying with us. They don\u2019t mind the kids either. \n\nOkay, so I'm going with NTA. I notice your husband has no problem with this. I'm guessing that the cleaning and cooking and child care all fall on you, so it doesn't inconvenience him at all. If so, this isn't an In-Law Problem. This is a Husband Problem.", "NTA for not wanting to have guests so early in your new home, or wanting them to be there when you return from trip. Calling them squatters was a bit uncalled for but you understand your mistake. You should explain to your husband that you need time to nest in your new house without having to rush it because guests are coming, without having to fend off others opinions about what should go where. And you are pregnant and you need rest time without having to cater for guests and travel will be exhausting so you will want to have time on your own after you have returned.", "NTA\n\nIt's your personal space, a safe place where you can completely decompress. I don't mean to say your in-laws aren't safe people, more that it is a different feeling when you have your own space and when you share it with other people. Especially with a new born (or one on the way, not sure when baby is due).", "I made this post few weeks ago and got some helpful advice: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12p941p/aita_not_welcoming_inlaws/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1 Thank you for that!", "Nope, NTA, and I in fact agree with you framing it as \"squatting\". I think the idea is incredibly tacky.", "NTA\nWhy would anyone think its oky to key people sray in your personal space when your not there", "NTA. Unless FIL is an electrician and promised to do all the rough-in electrical and circuit mapping that week, sure. If they aren\u2019t planning to work, or you don\u2019t believe they will, then no invite. You need assistance, not spectators to come snoop.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
