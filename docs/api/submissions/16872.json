Why would this even be a suggestion? Does he want house sitters for no real reason? It's your new house, you don't even have furniture yet. I doubt you'll be that far along with the house by the time you leave. NTA.\n\nAhh I see. They're offering to \"help\" with the house despite the fact that they never offered any help before and actually taken advantage of you multiple times. No.", "NTA. I don't even understand why someone would suggest this.", "INFO: it's really hard to say without knowing more about the in-laws. Are they generally decent, tidy people? Or are they a storm of destruction just one step ahead of catastrophe at all times? Why do they need to stay in your house at all? Are they getting evicted? Or is is it just to guard your house while it's empty? Do they live far away? Are they bringing five drooling dogs with them? \n\nWhy does your husband want them there while you're gone?\n\nEDIT: Oh, I see your additional post:\n\n>they expect to be waited and entertained when they're staying with us. They don\u2019t mind the kids either. \n\nOkay, so I'm going with NTA. I notice your husband has no problem with this. I'm guessing that the cleaning and cooking and child care all fall on you, so it doesn't inconvenience him at all. If so, this isn't an In-Law Problem. This is a Husband Problem.", "NTA for not wanting to have guests so early in your new home, or wanting them to be there when you return from trip. Calling them squatters was a bit uncalled for but you understand your mistake. You should explain to your husband that you need time to nest in your new house without having to rush it because guests are coming, without having to fend off others opinions about what should go where. And you are pregnant and you need rest time without having to cater for guests and travel will be exhausting so you will want to have time on your own after you have returned.", "NTA\n\nIt's your personal space, a safe place where you can completely decompress. I don't mean to say your in-laws aren't safe people, more that it is a different feeling when you have your own space and when you share it with other people.

I think the idea is incredibly tacky.", "NTA\nWhy would anyone think its oky to key people sray in your personal space when your not there", "NTA. Unless FIL is an electrician and promised to do all the rough-in electrical and circuit mapping that week, sure.

What's the rush why do they need to be there without you", "NTA why would they do this?  You won't be there, it's not like they're visiting you.  Is the house in a vacation area or something?", "NTA- Who in their right mind wants to come home to company waiting after vacation???? Hell no! Everyone I know, including myself, is always exhausted after a vacation. You just want to chill out for a day or two and get resettled back into your life. Now he thinks coming home to company and having to entertain them is a good idea?? Not to mention you being pregnant on top of all that! This would be a hill I would die on. No way would I allow that. And what does that say about the in-laws who want impose themselves on you after your vacation and while you\u2019re pregnant in a house that is not finished and ready for guests?? Ugh. Are they planning on helping paint or do any renovations? If not then Id say no because if they get there and the house is so bare and unfurnished how are they going to be comfortable? They are bound to complain about it. Are they going to expect to sleep in your bed? Will you be fighting over chairs? I\u2019d probably tell him he can have one or the other. Either cancel the vacation and work on the house so it\u2019s ready when they come or take the vacation without them coming to visit, but not both. I can\u2019t stress enough how important it is to vet your future in-laws like you do your SO because you have to deal with them too. And if they are pushy and intrusive then they\u2019re always around more than you want then to be. Such as situations like this. It should be obvious that it is a bad time. My parents would have never done something like this. This shouldn\u2019t have been a suggestion to start with. In-laws can make your life hell, and ruin your marriage if it\u2019s bad enough. Set your boundaries now.", "NTA\n\nDon't put up people when you have no furniture", "YTA. You have veto power over who stays in your house but your husband is right about your attitude. \n\nYou saying:\n\n>I lost my temper and called the in-laws squatters\n\nMakes me doubt that:\n\n>I would love to be in a position to invite house guests when we\u2019re ready.\n\nIt sounds like you don't respect your in-laws. That's fine but don't be disingenuous about it.", "Yes you are", "NTA\n\nAs a pregnant women who is also renovating a property, and who also has in-laws who want to visit, I can understand how you are feeling right now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIMO it is your husband who has the attitude problem. Why does he want them staying at yours when you are away? Why is he treating your house like a hotel? Has he already made promises to them? How trustworthy are they? I would not be comfortable leaving them in my property so they can rifle through all my possessions, all my personal documents, and potentially break my things. How clean are they? Are you going to feel like you need to sanitise everything when you get home? Where are they going to sleep? Are they going to be in your bed where you sleep with your husband? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are away, these relatives aren't going to sleep on the floor when your bed is an option for them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI read your other post and I have been through the exact same as you. We ended up letting the relative sleep on a camping mattress on the floor for 5 days due to guilt and there insistence, and it was way too much. I think we were all relieved when it was over.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSO and I are on the same page, but I do feel guilty. We've agreed that any visitors need to stay elsewhere whilst we do the house up. Then for the first few months when the baby is here we won't be accepting visitors, as it will be flu season and some relatives cannot be trusted to use good judgement. It isn't fair to allow one, but not the other, so there will be a blanket ban on everyone until baby has better immunity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel the same as you, I'd love to have visitors eventually, but whilst we are in the midst of working on a property, living out of boxes, sitting on our bed instead of chairs, this isn't that time.", "Oh\u2026he wants them to buy furniture so he doesn\u2019t have to. \n\nOP will come home to some ugly donkey furniture and her husband will throw a fit every time she wants to replace it \u201cbecause my parents bought it!\u201d", "The more info you give with your \u201cno\u201d the more arguments they can create. \n\u201cNo\u201d is a complete sentence.", "NTA \n\nWhy should they be in your home while you're away? \n\nAlso, seeing your comments tell your husband that HE can handle his parents' entertainment when they visit as you already have children to mind and aren't adding anyone else to that.", "You got it. I fear OP would return from her trip abroad to find the house decorated to the IL's taste and absolutely not hers.\n\nThen she wouldn't feel the house as *her house* anymore.", "Yes! This is a major point - maybe not the part where the ILs would buy furniture, but the part where they arrange and decorate to their will and taste, and when OP tries to change anything, husband would throw a tantrum bc \"my mommy put this painting here, I don't care you think it's hideous, my mommy doesn't think the same, so it remains right here!\"", "NTA.

It\u2019s a \u201ctwo yesses, one no\u201d type of situation. Nice idea, but if OP isn\u2019t comfortable\u2026 it\u2019s their house too, so they get a veto.", "Sure, house-sitting I totally get. But, yeah, this doesn't look like this was brought up in the context of house-sitting but of in-laws wanting to see the house (and snoop).", "NTA, this is weird.", "NTA.  This is your home to decorate as you want to in the timeframe you want to.  It isn't a blank canvas for your in-laws to come in and make their own home #2.  And they will try to come in and decorate for you, thinking they are doing you a favor.    But part of the fun is making the home \\*exactly\\* what you want, and sitting on your new furniture for the first time, decorating it your way, etc.\n\nThey have no need to be there until you are both ready \\*together\\* for them to be there.  If your hubby can't understand that, then he still hasn't cut the cords, and doesn't realize that they not his primary family any more.  You two are on your adventure together.  \n\nI would stand firm on this, because it is not only important to have these events as a couple yourself, but it sets the clear tone and message for the future that they are not primary people that can just walk in whenever and wherever they want.\n\nAnd if this does happen, I would bet that you discover they kept a key for themselves.", "*our house, that needs work*\n\nStand your ground, OP.  If you leave them alone you will find out that a lot of work and arranging was done in your absence, *but not necessarily done the way that you want*.\n\nMake sure that there is no way that they can get a key and enter while you are gone, OP.  This would be my hill to die on.\n\nAbsolutely NTA", "NTA. Do not let these people be the first ones to stay in your new house. It will always feel different afterwards if you do. There\u2019s something about a new house, it\u2019s like a bonding period almost - it\u2019s YOUR new place, you need time in it to nest and settle and, well, bond with the house. \n\nAlso, I hate your in-laws (I read your other post about them - yup, they are The Worst) and I\u2019m bothered that your husband is fiddle-foofing around on this.

I agree there\u2019s obvs more to it since OP seems weirded out, so I would be inclined to say \u201chard pass\u201d as well, but purely conceptually it really isn\u2019t strange at all, in my opinion.
