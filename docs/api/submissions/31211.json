That\u2019s a pretty big plot point to gloss over?", "NTA at most you should pay half the registration, but considering how much extra you\u2019ve done with the arrangement with step son, you shouldn\u2019t really need to give extra money. And honestly, the kid is a senior. Colleges have done a lot of their scouting. I find it hard to believe playing one season in this league will make a big difference at this stage.", "NTA. She's 18, an adult. You shouldn't be paying child support for her or the son living with you. Your job isn't to be the \"nice guy\" and help the ex, it's to look after your family. Pay for travel, medical, and the child support that she actually is owed, and nothing more. Anything on top of that is your choice. The eldest sounds like a spoiled brat, I'd tell her to get a job and pay for it herself if she wants it so bad.", "NTA. You're still paying child support for the son living with you. Ex can pay the volleyball", "Why is volleyball a 2000 dollar registration her senior year of high school or is it her first year of college.  At 18 why the heck would you pay it, if it's not in the divorce decree and how do you know the money will be used for volleyball?  Most sport teams non school are not that much in the US and volleyball in the states is a fall sport for high school and college.  So ask them what the 2000 dollars is really for or ask your spouse.", "The problem here is that you have given your husband's ex wife unrealistic expectations of your financial situation and that has transferred to the 18 year old. By doing extra you have given the impression that money is no issue for you and your husband, so their expectations are out of sync with what you can realistically do for them. You're paying thousands of dollars extra per year than you have to, therefore they think you have thousands to spare.\n\n\nNTA for saying no, especially because it impacts the quality of living for the children in your home. But an honest conversation needs to happen with the ex, and you should think about the consequences that have happened, and how this is likely to happen again with the younger daughter living with her mother. You don't have to disclose your finances to the ex, but I do think you need to lower the amount you are giving her. And you need a lawyer to do this. You've set a standard and she could try and force you to maintain her living standards, even when you don't want to anymore.", "NTA\n\nUnless the court order, Stepdaughter is a legal adult and costs for sports are her responsibility.\n\nAnd college applications are being complete now through the next couple months.  So, no, joining a travel team now isn't going to marginally improve her odds of college acceptance or scholarships.\n\nFollow the court order.", "INFO It sounds like your stepdaughter can\u2019t go to college unless she plays volleyball and the registration will be $2k. Is this correct?\n\nAlso what are her college fund arrangements?", "NTA Honestly, this sounds a bit sketchy to me. If she was going to get a volleyball scholarship, she would have had to be playing well before halfway through her senior year. Plus, what league requires $2000 up front? I might just be out of touch, but that seems steep. Plus, your husband is still paying child support on his adult daughter, as well as travel expenses and medical bills?  Seems like if she had a shot at a college scholarship, saving for or paying league fees should have come up before this. Something just seems off here...", "NTA but I suggest stopping full child support for the kid that is currently living with you full time and some of the travel and then using that money to pay more for her. It sounds like you are being extra generous with the boys but not so for her.", "YTA. You\u2019re essentially saying \u201cmy kids are more important than my husband\u2019s.\u201d\n\nI would also bet there\u2019s a good reason why your step daughter wrote you off.", "NTA.
