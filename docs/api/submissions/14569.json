My wedding is child-free and my family has always known this. I love my nieces and nephews but I feel like having them at my wedding would cause too many distractions. \n\nMy wedding is a few hours out of the city my family lives in and is in the morning so many people have booked hotels. To try to be considerate to guest with children, I hired some reputable babysitters and rented out a place meant for children\u2019s birthday party\u2019s so parents could drop their kids off somewhere before the wedding without having to find a sitter at home. The problem is my sister (31) has a special-needs child. He is wheelchair-bound and will be for his whole life. He requires very specialized supervision and the babysitters I hired will not be qualified. \n\nBecause of this, my sister asked me if I could make an exception to my child-free policy so she could watch him and attend my wedding. I told I was very sorry but I didn\u2019t think I should make an exception. I suggested she find a sitter who is qualified and they can even use the same venue the other kids will be using. She told me told me that qualified sitters are very expensive and very hard to find. She also said that whenever she needs a sitter at home, it\u2019s usually somebody else in the family who is familiar with her child\u2019s condition but they will all be at the wedding. I told her it was a no and she called me and AH. I haven\u2019t spoken to her since. \n\nSome people in my family are on my side but some are against me and say I should make an exception. So, AITA for not letting my sister bring her child to my child-free wedding?", "created_utc": 1681252044, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12j022b/aita_for_not_letting_my_sister_bring_her_son_to/", "score": 216, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your own sister. Let that sink in.\n\nNAH, it\"s still very much your choice, but do you want this to ruin your relationship with your sister?", "INFO: I understand wanting a child-free wedding. I also usually understand not wanting to make an exception. Usually it's because other parents see the exception and feel slighted. \n\nAnd yet... Hosting a private venue with a hired babysitter sounds like a pretty impressive accommodation for parents you've invited. As a parent, I'd be thrilled to drop my kids off at a babysitter that's already paid for - so if I saw \"an exception\" made, I wouldn't feel slighted. \n\nSo, why exactly are you preferring not to make this exception?\n\nALSO, I'm curious... Did you reach out to her specifically ahead of invitations to chat about this, or did you just send the invitations out to everyone all the same and then she called you with questions?", "It doesn't sound like it's feasible for your sister to find childcare for your wedding.  Her child and his needs come first for her as a parent, so this means that likely she will not be able to attend your wedding.  \n\nSo long as you are fine with that, NAH.", "This is a hard one. I'm inclined to say NAH, because everyone here in my opinion is in a difficult situation. You have advertised that this is child free for a long time, and everyone else will be leaving their children with carers you paid for. Your sister is in a very difficult situation because her child needs special care that many carers are not qualified for.\n\nMay I make a suggestion? Ask your sister to research carers that would be available that day and offer to split the costs. It would be expensive, but both of you want her involvement in your big day and for her son to be looked after. Consider it a necessary extra cost.", "Info why did you even invite your sister? Seems like you've gone out of your way to make it hard for her to come", "YTA  because you excluded your special needs nephew from your care plan for other children, yet expect your sister to pay a lot of money to attend your wedding. You made things easier for everyone except specifically your sister.\n\nSo to your sister, YTA. You can be within your rights and still be TA.\n\nI would think most of your guests would be understanding of the situation that you can't just leave a special needs child with anyone. \n\nJust be prepared for people in your family to remember how you treated this nephew and sister.", "Is your nephew one of the reasons you choose to have a child free weeding?", "You are 1,000% TA. You say special needs, but we're talking about a kid who, from the sound of it, needs 24-hour care. My nephew was born severely disabled; my sister and her husband went through HELL for 15 \u00bd years until he passed away--and then a fresh hell started for them. You cannot BEGIN fathom what your sister's life is like. Shit like this just boils my piss.", "I\u2019m confused if you knew the babysitters you hired couldn\u2019t care for your new phew, what exactly was the plan? Like, you\u2019re very much aware that your sister will not be able to attend your wedding otherwise so obviously she would ask?", "Technically NTA but she is well within her rights to decline the invitation to your wedding.  Ultimately what is more important - making no exceptions or having a relationship with your sister.", "Does her partner not have relatives who can help out? \nI feel for your sister as she needs to trust the person taking care of her child but if they are nearby you have done everything you can to accommodate. \nI\u2019d like to know the age of the child. Are they likely to be noisy and distracting or are they capable of quiet and sensible time. \nI think you need to relax a little maybe say yes for the ceremony but then ask her and her partner to take turns supervising the child in the children\u2019s area.", "YTA because you knew about his condition from the beginning and didn't take that into account when researching and hiring sitters. That means this 100% comes across as excluding your sister and her son because of his disability. You're not obligated to provide sitters when having a child-free wedding, but providing sitters that can only take care of some kids is a massive oversight.", "You have the right to have a child free wedding. In doing so you have to accept the fall out from people who disagree with your decision. You knew your nephew was special needs and needed specialized care yet didn\u2019t find a babysitter who could handle it (but found a sitter for the other kids?). It seems like your intention was never for your sister to attend your wedding.\n\nI\u2019m somewhere between YTA and NAH, I\u2019ll see how your comments shake out and edit later with my final decision.", "YTA. Literally every single other parent has childcare provided for them. It's not possible for your nephew so he's an exception. I cannot imagine ever being so selfish as to worry about my disabled nephew overshadowing my wedding. You're going to permanently damage your relationship with your sister. I'm so sad for your sister that you're not on her side, I genuinely think you're cruel and a bad person.  If it were me and someone tried to make a fuss I'd look them dead in the eye and tell them that my nephew is the exception and if they don't like it they can leave.", "YTA unless you pay for the expensive babysitter who is qualified to keep him safe. You\u2019ve paid for the other babysitters, surely you can pay for his, too. If you really want your sister there, you\u2019ll make it work.", "I support people who want to make their own rules for their wedding, but I also believe there are exceptions to every rule. This is an extenuating circumstance. It\u2019s not a random cousin who doesn\u2019t want to leave her child with a sitter, it\u2019s your sister who CAN\u2019T leave her child with a sitter. You are essentially telling your sister that you don\u2019t care if she\u2019s at your wedding or not. \n\nHonestly, I feel like YTA.", "Technically NTA but yes YTA.", "YTA I was with you untill you disclosures the kid has very special needs. Unless you don't want your sister at your wedding for some reason you are not telling us, there's no way to side with you there.", "Gonna say NAH. She needs to understand your position on your wedding, but also, I'm not entirely unsympathetic to her here. While what you said wasn't anything wrong, I bet what she heard was, \"I know you're already stressed cating for your child, but please spend extra money on a very expensive stranger when its clear you really only trust family.\" \n\nIt's a tough situation, and I don't doubt your sister is naturally predisposed to take the news worse due to her being protective, and the fact that you've basically provided childcare for everyone BUT her. I dont blame you for this\u2014its an extra expense when you're already spending so much\u2014but that's probably how it feels from her side.\n\nA way forward might be to cover or aplit the cost of a specialist if that's feasible for you. If not, I think she's gotta swallow a very bitter pill that not everything is accessible to her and her son, and decide if she's able to cough up the bill or just stay home. This isn't a fun position for anyone, and I hope it resolves well.", "NAH.\nThis is one of those situations where I don't think an asshole is the right term but I still think it would be wiser to just let her bring your nephew. \n\nYou have a right to have a child-free wedding. It's also not your responsibility to provide child care for every situation. So you're not an asshole.\n\nYet I also sympathize with your sister since parents of children with certain disabilities can really struggle to obtain qualified sitters. Often they can't afford it. So I can't say she's an asshole either.\n\nYet, is it really such an imposition to have him there that it's worth ruining your relationship with your sister and nephew? Because here's the thing. Your sister very likely won't come if you don't allow her son to come. That may be important to you or it may not. But 10 years from now, your relationship will likely still be tense because you didn't bend even slightly to help her out. Your nephew will see you as the aunt that cared so much about maintaining a child-free wedding that she couldn't stand to have him there even if it meant her sister couldn't go.\n\nNow maybe he has other things that would make him a disruption, such as calling out at random times or throwing fits, but since you didn't include that, it seems like this is more about wanting to be child-free no matter what.", "I think an exception *can* be made here, specifically because the child is special needs and wheelchair bound. Weddings are usually child-free because they can be loud and rambunctious and distracting. This child will be in one spot, causing very little distraction, and may only require one adult (likely his mother, and trade-offs for her restroom needs) sitting with him. There's lots of down time for guests at a wedding. It's not like she's going to be constantly on the move like you and your fianc\u00e9e. I think your sister would rather be there and also care for her son than be excluded completely. YTA", "YTA", "So sick of brides in this sub acting surprised pikachu face when their siblings with children (especially newborns and children with disabilities) cannot attend their wedding or feel disrespected by their child-free policy. Like CAN WE PLEASE BE SERIOUS?\n\nHave your wedding. Make any kind of rules you want in regards to your guests etc. But don\u2019t be shocked when it causes rifts in your family because said rules are utterly unsympathetic and intentionally exclusionary to the people closest to you. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nHow is a special needs nephew going to be a distraction?\n\nWhat kinda bridezilla are you?\n\nMan, I feel awful for your fiance. Hope he wises up. \n\nYTA. Hugely.", "YTA. You lack empathy and understanding. You care more about a policy than a person. If you had a reason why your nephew would create an issue with your wedding, then there may be a different judgment, but the only thing you mentioned is the rule.", "YTA - For excluding the child. You paid for everyone else\u2019s sitters and accommodated them so they wouldn\u2019t have the hassle of having to find sitters themselves\u2026but didn\u2019t do that at all for your sister, the one who arguably needed that help the most. It feels very targeted and exclusionary.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to make an exception so her child can attend the wedding. But you\u2019re an AH because you *already made an exception* by refusing to accommodate her child when you did so for everyone else.", "NTA only if you don't care if your sister doesn't come. If you plan on holding it against her YTA.", "NAH but I *REALLY* struggled.\n\nI absolutely believe it's up to the bride and groom whether or not to allow children.  You also begin your whole post with the fact that your family has known this since the dawn of time.\n\nWith the fact that a relationship with your sister is so (genetically) close AND the fact the child is disabled a big part of me wants to say let them come.  The other part of me says, if no one else than not your sister's either.  This probably means me, the ahole, but if you didn't want the distraction of any child, it's possible that the presence of one with additional needs would be more of a distraction.\n\nBut then again, you were so gracious you provided childcare at your costs for the other guests. While I think this is super generous, there are now two main venues for wedding and kid's party and your nephew can't attend either.  It almost makes him MORE left out and certainly now the only one who cannot be accommodated.\n\nI understand why your sister is upset and there's so many shades of grey here, I am not sure you can hold it against her.  I would reach out one more time and see if you can reach any middle ground, for example:\n\nI can't afford the specialist care x needs, but fiance and I can offer $___ if that can help to make arrangements.\n\nI know that it's important that X gets proper care, can Cousin Dana and Uncle Todd help with care at the party, so you can enjoy some of the celebration with us?  (Ie, are there family members she trusts that can help, who maybe have a less close connection)\n\nI'm so sorry we weren't able to come to a compromise but we love you both.  After the honeymoon can we come show you and X some pictures.  We'll bring some cake, we really want to celebrate with you.\"\n\nJust think hard and don't leave it where it is.  It's not worth losing family over.  You are protecting your dream and she is standing up for her kid.", "YTA!", "NAH, but be prepared for her not to attend your wedding", "YTA you should 100% find a qualified baby sister and pay for it because you should want your sister there and want your nephew to be safe. It sounds like you don\u2019t like you sister and want her to drop out of the wedding. It\u2019s clearly a safety issue so even a exception for your sister to bring him, I think other guests would understand", "I find kids to be the best part of weddings. They are so cute in their dress clothes, tear up the dance floor and conk out early. Yes sometimes there is crying and shenanigans\u2026 NTA but I can\u2019t help but feel like you\u2019re missing out.", "YTA. This is not a rambunctious child. It is a disabled child with specific care needs. Do you think the child will be making wheelies in the wheelchair? No. How sad you lost a sister.", "YTA. I LOVE that you are providing care and a kid event for everyone else. That's very NTA of you. But special needs means special consideration. I vote kiddo gets to come and the other kids don't.

Equity is being adaptable and fair, not treating everyone the same.", "I think YTA here because your \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be fair to make an exception\u201d reasoning doesn\u2019t really make sense in this case. I really can\u2019t imagine that anyone would be mad to see your nephew who needs specialized care at an otherwise child-free wedding, especially because you\u2019re providing care for everyone else\u2019s kids, which I\u2019m sure most people would probably prefer to taking their kids to the wedding honestly. \n\nAnd to that point, you\u2019re actually the one that\u2019s made them a special case requiring some kind of exception by making a care plan for all of children except this one child. It\u2019s actually you who has made him an exception in one way or another by creating a plan that he is excluded from. I think it\u2019s on you at this point to either find and pay for qualified care from the wedding budget (because you are currently doing that for everyone else\u2019s children except him) or to allow him at the wedding so your sister can attend.", "YTA You know your nephew is a special case & yet you made childcare plans for him as though he could be cared for by the service you found. You know full well that your sister doesn\u2019t leave her son with strangers - and for good reason.\n\nI\u2019m generally fine with the child-free wedding. In this singular case, though, you\u2019re quite aware that excluding your nephew means excluding your sister. Perhaps this was your goal?", "YTA. \n\nThe decision to have a child-free wedding is understandable, and you're absolutely allowed to make the rules for your own wedding day, but in doing so you are 1000% being a huge asshole (to say the least). \n\nFirst of all, it's your sister. A lot of people would've already made acceptions for their nieces / nephews just because they're your sibling's kids, so not even making the acception when you know it's a special case where your nephew needs special care is harsh. Especially since you're okay with excluding your sister from your wedding because you're so determined to keep your \"no children\" rule. \n\nYou're drawing a really harsh boundary here that makes me wonder if you forgot to write the part where you and your sister were estranged, because I can't understand why you would be doing this to your sibling and her special needs child if you had a healthy relationship with them. Her feelings must be really hurt.", "YTA. No one will care. No one.", "YTA\n\nI have a kid with additional needs. Your sister was being kind/optimistic saying suitable sitters are expensive and hard to find. There ARE NONE is what she means. She leaves her son with family usually because they are the only other people on earth she can be sure will be able to care for him adequately.\n\nAnyway I can't believe you have watched your own sister parent her kid and NOT understood that your no kid rule specifically uninvites her from attending. Like you KNEW when you said \"no kids\" you were saying \"no sister\". This is a pretty cowardly way to make sure your sister can't attend tbh, you should've been more up front and straight up told her you don't want her there, but \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f it's your wedding, as long as you don't have the audacity to be annoyed when she doesn't come then I guess you get to be TA.", "What is the specific reason why you don\u2019t want to make an exception in this case?

My wedding is child-free and my family has always known this. I love my nieces and nephews but I feel like having them at my wedding would cause too many distractions. My wedding is a few hours out of the city my family lives in and is in the morning so many people have booked hotels. To try to be considerate to guest with children, I hired some reputable babysitters and rented out a place meant for children\u2019s birthday party\u2019s so parents could drop their kids off somewhere before the wedding without having to find a sitter at home. The problem is my sister (31) has a special-needs child. He is wheelchair-bound and will be for his whole life. He requires very specialized supervision and the babysitters I hired will not be qualified. Because of this, my sister asked me if I could make an exception to my child-free policy so she could watch him and attend my wedding. I told I was very sorry but I didn\u2019t think I should make an exception. I suggested she find a sitter who is qualified and they can even use the same venue the other kids will be using. She told me told me that qualified sitters are very expensive and very hard to find. She also said that whenever she needs a sitter at home, it\u2019s usually somebody else in the family who is familiar with her child\u2019s condition but they will all be at the wedding. I told her it was a no and she called me and AH. I haven\u2019t spoken to her since. Some people in my family are on my side but some are against me and say I should make an exception. So, AITA for not letting my sister bring her child to my child-free wedding?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I personally couldn\u2019t imagine getting married at a traditional wedding and not inviting my nieces/nephews but then I\u2019d probably bugger off and do it without anyone there as I hate people looking at me.

I would grant this exception because the is such a unique situation and it is your sister not some extended family member or friend making the request.", "You're entitled to a child free wedding. The only thing I can think of is to split the cost of a specialized sitter with her?  Either way, my husband's cousin, whom we live, is getting married in a child free wedding. It's also a few hours from home. We went to the bridal shower but said we couldn't go to the wedding. It was very drama free, we understood, his cousin understood, it was fine.

Are you out of your mind?", "Kinda want to go with YTA here because usually people want a child free wedding because they can be little shits, running around and misbehaving.

You are allowed to have whoever you want there (or not).", "YTA. Big time. And ableist. I'm going to guess that you think the presence of someone in a wheelchair will taint your wedding somehow. It doesn't sound like this has anything to do with a potential outburst. You don't mention that your nephew has unpredictable behaviors, and I would assume your sister wouldn't suggest bringing him if this were the case. \n\nYour sister lives an incredibly difficult life. You are excluding her from your wedding by being indifferent to her childcare needs.\n\nBy the way, my older sister had a flower girl who was in a wheelchair.

Special needs babysitters are 15\u00d7more expensive than regular babysitters. Weddings have a budget too. If you're having a child free wedding,it's best to leave the babysitter arrangements to the parents so no one is left out.", "You're well within your right to not want kids at your wedding, that part doesn't make you an asshole.\n I think it's weird to go above and beyond for the other kids and parents at your wedding but not at all for your sister and your nephew who you knew it would be the most difficult for. You really didn't have to do anything for anyone else's kids because people have child free weddings all the time and people can hire their own babysitters usually. What you're doing is weird and even though you're not wrong for wanting to exclude kids from the wedding, the way you've gone about it definitely makes you the asshole.\n\n I feel like you're leaving something out and this is about not wanting your sister there because you clearly knew what was gonna happen.", "Yes to be prepared for the fallout. My wife had a relative who had a child free wedding. We had a 2 children under 3 at the time and one was obviously just a little baby. We had never had anyone but family babysit the baby yet at this point. The family would all be at the wedding. \n\nSo, I stayed home with the kids, while my wife went to the wedding. The bride acted like it was a snub that I didn\u2019t go and my wife had to leave at 11pm. They wanted us to get a hotel room and party late. My wife was breast feeding, she wasn\u2019t going to stay up and party late regardless. Just absolute craziness. We lived close enough to the venue, we figured we would just stay in our own house rather than stay in the hotel. \n\nIt\u2019s just funny because the bride is a mom now and is like super mom, and there is zero chance she would leave her baby with a babysitter to go party at a wedding. We are friendly with them and it\u2019s water under the bridge, but at the time, we were like how are we supposed to not bring the kids and have both of us there.", "Yep. My husband and my best friends just got married. They had a childfree wedding. But guess who was there? My wheelchair bound, medically complex son. They knew that we wouldn't be able to find someone to safely watch him, but they wanted us there, so they made an exception. I guarantee it would cost hundreds of dollars for her to pay a sitter for the day, if she's lucky enough to find someone qualified (odds are low). This would 100% be OP banning sister from the wedding. I actually vote YTA because OP acts like she isn't actually banning her sister from the wedding, because sister can just do [highly improbable solution].", "Basically it.

It was a sh*t show. My family still talk about it negatively a decade later and they spent 100k on this wedding, it was at a castle.\n\nMy cousin's wife made all these decisions, and he used to be very close to my brothers & they are no longer close since the wedding.\n\nChildfree weddings are not worth the headache, and I know I couldn't personally turn my sister away with her child if there are no other options. I also have a brother with special needs and worked with kids with severe disabilities. \n\nI'm not going to judge this one, as I'll just be making it personal. I think OP needs to think about how much she wants her sister to attend, and if holding onto the 'childfree' rule with no exceptions will be worth not having her there.", ">sister is essentially prevented from attending your wedding.\n\nOnly if there is no father in the picture. In case there is, I don't see it as unreasonable to assume that the sister can come. The kids will have more fun in their arrangement and I bet the kid would rather be there, accompanied with his father.", "OP is not the one *ruining* the relationship.", "Agreeing with you here that no reasonable person would see a special needs child (who is also the bride's nephew) and be like \"This is an unfair exception.\" Especially when they were provided free childcare.", "I think another option that might solve all the hard feelings is for *OP* to hire and pay for a special needs sitter for the event. That shows good will and makes it easier on her sister, while preserving her child free wedding.", "Excellent questions", "This is a terrific idea in theory. The kids get to spend the day having a big party while parents relax and enjoy adult conversation. \n\nHowever I may be totally off and reading more into the post but op states that she loves her neice and nephew but she feel they be too much of a distraction. She didn\u2019t say kids in general she only mentions the neice and nephew. \n\nSo here\u2019s my theory. I may be totally reaching but we all do we take one incident on here a dialect it, I think the special needs nephews the one op doesn\u2019t want. Be it maybe she thinks the wheel chair and medical equipment makes too much noise. Be it that her family would flaunt all over him and he would steal some of her spotlight. Or be it sister turns every event into making him the spotlight. Or she is just afraid him being in wedding pics will ruin them. Not sure why I feel he is the reason for the no child rule. \n\nI think op thought the child\u2019s party venue would make her seem less bad in everyone\u2019s eyes. Hiring babysitters where a little icing to make her seem like a wonderful person. But here is the problem op didn\u2019t realize how much a specialized sitter would cost or she didn\u2019t realize how hard they where to fine. So now she has dropped all this money and her sister wants an exception. \n\nIf the senerio is the reason then I think you know the answer weather YTA or not. If you went to all this trouble because you honestly believed the kids would have a better Time then you are NTA. \n\nBut given the venue what can your nephew do with his medical limitations at this venue? And the next thing to consider does nephew know what\u2019s going on around him, because if he does and you expected him to sit in his chair and watch children play around him that is cruel. \n\n\nAt the end of the it\u2019s your wedding. Your entitled to plan and have the wedding of your dreams. Does that mean you don\u2019t have to provide a exception? Yes. Does that also mean your sister has a right to be upset? Yes", ">likely she will not be able to attend your wedding\n\nThere's no way this wasn't the intention. She's not noticed her own sister's life or her own nephew's needs? No way. She just wanted to exclude her sister for some reason.\n\nShe's a double AH because she did it this way so her sister had to be the one to refuse to come, instead of the OP just not inviting her in the first place.", "Agreed. You're paying for qualified care for everyone else, find out how much qualified care for your nephew is, and cover as much as you can.", "It\u2019s certain that any qualified carers, and chances are he will need two people on the day, will want to meet with mum and nephew before the day to go over his care needs. \n\nThis isn\u2019t just going to be a \u201cbedtimes at 8, there\u2019s a pizza in the freezer for you, bye\u201d babysitting job. If big **IF** mum can get carers for the wedding it is going to be terrifyingly expensive and will only become more expensive the higher his care/medical needs are.", "I think that doing something for kids like this is a awesome idea. She can have cake and pizzas for them throw them a great celebration. The kids would have a better time doing this then sitting still for 3-4 hours at a boring wedding. But she didn\u2019t really take her nephew in consideration. Plus I have several questions about nephews condition!:\n\n1- is he able to enjoy the venue with his medical limitations. (Line is this a jumps-zone and you expected him to sit while other kids enjoyed themselves).\n 2- if his medical limitations won\u2019t allow him to enjoy the venue is your nephew aware of his surroundings. Because if he is aware it would have been cruel for him to have to sit and watch other children have a good time.", "Is there any way they can show the ceremony LIVE?

This is exactly right.", "OP's care plan already goes far above and beyond", "Weddings are already super expensive to go to as a guest as well. It's nice she provided childcare for the rest of the family's kids, but the person who probably needs it the most is her sister. Having a disabled child comes with a lot of costs, and telling her basically \"pay a specialized sitter or don't come\" is a pretty cruel thing to do to your sister.\n\nLike, I get child free weddings. But, if it's to the point where you're fine excluding the people you love from a major life event, that makes me think this wedding is more about a party. And imo, that's pretty weird you would prioritize a party over making sure everyone you love can come.\n\nYTA do what you want, but your sister and others in your family will remember this decision.", "And OP doesn't want that hell at her wedding", "This is exactly where I get stuck in the story and on my vote!  It\u2019s not like the special needs are a new development.", "You\u2019re assuming there is a partner.", "For me what clinched it is the fact that OP hired sitters. If she had said it's a child-free wedding and the sitters weren't a thing, I'd be more inclined to say NTA because everyone is expected to make their own arrangements, so sister's situation is unfortunate (because the sitter would be more expensive) but not such a glaring exception compared to everyone else.", "I think my answer was almost exactly this. I agree!", "Special needs kids can be a huge distraction. Loud noises because of excitement or boredom or confusion or just because those are the noises they use to communicate. I've been around a lot of special needs kids and this is something you can expect especially when they are severely disabled to the point where they'd need their own sitter. It's not their fault,  but not wanting that level of noise is actually understandable. People pay a lot for nice wedding videos and that can make the quality lesser. \n\nNow op could certainly help her sister a bit. Maybe they split the cost of a proper sitter or look into respite care and split that cost. There are many avenues op could take to keep their relationship in tact but thats kind of up to op if they actually cares about sisters attendence or not. But op might also be strapped for cash. Perhaps they should go to the family, particularly the family who thinks op should make the exception, and ask them to donate some money into a pool to help out as they say op should. Ten dollars from 10 people is 100$ and that's at least a start. \n\nIt's not like it's a multi-day event either. It's just one evening. I'm sure if they work together they can figure out something. If its so close to the date they can't find proper care I'd actually lay more blame on the sister. Everyone who has a disabled child knows how long it takes to set up this kind of care and weddings are often planned months and months in advanced so the sister was well aware of the issues she'd face and how difficult it might be. She could have done better and dealt with it sooner.", "Where I lean towards YTA with OP is she went out of her way to make special accommodations for all children except her nephew.  She could have discussed with her sister as soon as she had the idea of the different venue with babysitters to try and make it work.  She didn\u2019t though.  That\u2019s where I get stuck.", "Exactly best for the sister to go no contact", "\"It sounds like she wouldn't be able to enjoy your wedding festivities if she brought her son.\"\n\nThat is a huge assumption. Many parents shockingly like being around their children. Not to mention if the sister is making a fuss right now, even if she got a sitter she may be worrying the entire night about her son and not enjoy herself anyway. That's for her to decide what she enjoys", "At least op won't ever see them again.", "Personally, I would be okay with an exception for a handicap bound special needs child being at the wedding and my kid being at a free kid party with babysitters.", "\"One exception is going to lead to another.\"\n\nWhy do people say this? Is this really a thing that happens? Am I somehow abnormal because idgaf about making exceptions for one person and not for others?

Deal with it.\" Is it really that hard to do?", "Acting what way?", "Right. Very handicapped kids are not easy to pass off on non-parents to watch. These two have to come as a package deal, or the sister won't come at all.", "Right? Already rolled my eyes when she said that cuz it's like, no you don't. If you did, they would be there.

So, from her sister's POV, OP's thought of and taken care of everyone but her.\n\nNow, OP just has to consider how much she wants her own sister at her wedding and if she's willing to let this come between them, especially if they were close before this.\n\nIf her sister can't afford the certified babysitter, then she simply can't go. Hurt feelings will possibly arise because of OP paying for babysitters for the rest of the children when she could have paid for none and not singled out one parent.", "Except for her sister", "Not for her sister.", "Except for her own sister's kid and she knows the situation which IMO makes it worse.", "I would still be against it, but wouldn't seem that deliberate. Having someone with special needs in the family usually makes people more willing to accommodate to needs of others, not less. If they actually care for their family, that is.", "It\u2019s not hard at all, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really a thing that happens especially in this type of situation. All of OPs family already knows this child has additional needs. All the fianc\u00e9 needs to do is give his family a heads up (which is the kind thing but not necessary) and no one who is a well-adjusted adult should have a problem.", "I think this is kinda business rules coming into personal space.\n\nAt work I'm a boss and legally if I let Ramona, I do have to let Ted.  Not doing so can be labelled as discrimination.\n\nAt home tho, I make exceptions as I please.", "Yes, this really is a thing that happens. I'm not saying it happens in \\*every\\* case, but sometimes, when people see an exception being made for one person, they get upset when it is not made for them. It's good that you have the fortitude to drop the hammer like that. Not everybody is. Especially when the drama starts to build.", "It is selfishness\u2026the wedding is all about me. God forbid someone stop gazing upon my dress because a child made a noise. Then it becomes, I\u2019m the first woman to ever have a child. \n\nIt\u2019s so much more fun and relaxed with everyone there. A different relative had a wedding not long after and kids were invited. Our kids had my wife\u2019s cousins, aunts, multiple sets of grandparents, etc keeping them out of trouble during the reception. \n\nAt the reception, they got carried around by cousins, aunts, uncles, cousins girlfriends, the bride, the groom, grandparents. They passed out in their strollers and we hung out and had a great time. My MIL took them back to our room to put them to bed because she was tired of the reception and we got to hang out late. That\u2019s how it\u2019s done in my opinion.", "NieceS and nephewS. This is one nephew.", "Maybe she was hoping for a unicorn babysitter. But ultimately, she knew her sister could not attend due to the special needs kiddo.", "It is a bit of a reach, but I wouldn't say it's impossible.", "And the wedding is several hours away from a larger town where the family is situated. Who the hell is qualified to babysit in Bum-Fuck Iowa?", "Agreed. It seems like there's something else going on that op is not telling.", "Yeah, the castle was open to the public if you paid entry. They hired the full thing for the wedding and all the grounds. That was a huge cost alone. I was shook when I found out the price.", "not that  hard. I went to a wedding that probably cost that much. Her deess alone was probably 10k. Open  bar, top shelf. They got divorced  after 5 years. Her father was irrate when they got baxk together and screamed about the money he spent.", "But other relatives are ad mentioned? If he is less able than others then he is not in the picture. There is no mention about him or single mum situation, I feel bad for the sis if there is a father but all is up to the sis.", "Perhaps the in-laws aren't local. We haved always lived anywhere between 350 miles to 5000 miles from my in-laws for our entire married life. If so, the in-laws probably aren't up to speed on the necessary care for the boy.", "I hesitate to post whether I think OP is ah or not ah... But I get it. If it were my big day, I don't think I'd want the kid there either.", "I'm on OP's side here, I didn't weigh in on ah or not ah but if it were my big day, I wouldn't want the kid there either.", "I didn't weigh in on whether or not OP is the AH but I'm on her side. If it were my big day, I wouldn't want the kid there either", "Even the bride isn't a well adjusted adult, doesn't give you much hope for the rest of them...", "\"Especially when the drama starts to build.\" \n\nInteresting you mention that. I love watching drama happen. Maybe that's why I don't have a problem with it \ud83e\udee3 that might say more about me as a person than I care to admit lol", "Agreed\u2026 for the most part. I\u2019ve been to two weddings for two couples that were strongly against kids and they were a blast. One was a burlesque dancer and that wedding had jokes and themes that were not appropriate for kids. TBH, I usually miss my own kids but at that reception, after about 10 mins, I found myself having a lot of fun and was glad to be doing something else than watching \u2018Bluey\u2019 in my spare time", "I planned a family reunion style reception, so there were games, etc. for the kids. Everyone had a blast.", "Most of the things I remember from my wedding day is drinking, more drinking, counting all the money.... we we give money in our culture and then tubby tub and passing out from being tired. There was no sexy time. Couldn't even remember who attended apart from the wedding party, but the cake was good.", "Like I said I may be wrong and I hope I am absolutely off base and am just being jaded! But this is just a vibe I get!\n\nI actually hope op posts that proves me wrong. I will happily eat crow and tell you where right. If op can prove me wrong I will happily publicly apologize.", "Other relatives will be at the wedding obvs.", "That\u2019s completely fine as long as you won\u2019t get upset if there are some parents who won\u2019t come"]}
