My wedding is child-free and my family has always known this. I love my nieces and nephews but I feel like having them at my wedding would cause too many distractions. \n\nMy wedding is a few hours out of the city my family lives in and is in the morning so many people have booked hotels. To try to be considerate to guest with children, I hired some reputable babysitters and rented out a place meant for children\u2019s birthday party\u2019s so parents could drop their kids off somewhere before the wedding without having to find a sitter at home. The problem is my sister (31) has a special-needs child. He is wheelchair-bound and will be for his whole life. He requires very specialized supervision and the babysitters I hired will not be qualified. \n\nBecause of this, my sister asked me if I could make an exception to my child-free policy so she could watch him and attend my wedding. I told I was very sorry but I didn\u2019t think I should make an exception. I suggested she find a sitter who is qualified and they can even use the same venue the other kids will be using. She told me told me that qualified sitters are very expensive and very hard to find. She also said that whenever she needs a sitter at home, it\u2019s usually somebody else in the family who is familiar with her child\u2019s condition but they will all be at the wedding. I told her it was a no and she called me and AH. I haven\u2019t spoken to her since. \n\nSome people in my family are on my side but some are against me and say I should make an exception. So, AITA for not letting my sister bring her child to my child-free wedding?", "created_utc": 1681252044, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12j022b/aita_for_not_letting_my_sister_bring_her_son_to/", "score": 570, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your own sister. Let that sink in.\n\nNAH, it\"s still very much your choice, but do you want this to ruin your relationship with your sister?", "INFO: I understand wanting a child-free wedding. I also usually understand not wanting to make an exception. Usually it's because other parents see the exception and feel slighted. \n\nAnd yet... Hosting a private venue with a hired babysitter sounds like a pretty impressive accommodation for parents you've invited. As a parent, I'd be thrilled to drop my kids off at a babysitter that's already paid for - so if I saw \"an exception\" made, I wouldn't feel slighted. \n\nSo, why exactly are you preferring not to make this exception?\n\nALSO, I'm curious... Did you reach out to her specifically ahead of invitations to chat about this, or did you just send the invitations out to everyone all the same and then she called you with questions?", "It doesn't sound like it's feasible for your sister to find childcare for your wedding.  Her child and his needs come first for her as a parent, so this means that likely she will not be able to attend your wedding.  \n\nSo long as you are fine with that, NAH.", "This is a hard one. I'm inclined to say NAH, because everyone here in my opinion is in a difficult situation. You have advertised that this is child free for a long time, and everyone else will be leaving their children with carers you paid for. Your sister is in a very difficult situation because her child needs special care that many carers are not qualified for.\n\nMay I make a suggestion? Ask your sister to research carers that would be available that day and offer to split the costs. It would be expensive, but both of you want her involvement in your big day and for her son to be looked after. Consider it a necessary extra cost.", "Info why did you even invite your sister? Seems like you've gone out of your way to make it hard for her to come", "YTA  because you excluded your special needs nephew from your care plan for other children, yet expect your sister to pay a lot of money to attend your wedding. You made things easier for everyone except specifically your sister.\n\nSo to your sister, YTA. You can be within your rights and still be TA.\n\nI would think most of your guests would be understanding of the situation that you can't just leave a special needs child with anyone. \n\nJust be prepared for people in your family to remember how you treated this nephew and sister.", "Is your nephew one of the reasons you choose to have a child free weeding?", "You are 1,000% TA. You say special needs, but we're talking about a kid who, from the sound of it, needs 24-hour care. My nephew was born severely disabled; my sister and her husband went through HELL for 15 \u00bd years until he passed away--and then a fresh hell started for them. You cannot BEGIN fathom what your sister's life is like. Shit like this just boils my piss.", "I\u2019m confused if you knew the babysitters you hired couldn\u2019t care for your new phew, what exactly was the plan? Like, you\u2019re very much aware that your sister will not be able to attend your wedding otherwise so obviously she would ask?", "Technically NTA but she is well within her rights to decline the invitation to your wedding.  Ultimately what is more important - making no exceptions or having a relationship with your sister.", "Does her partner not have relatives who can help out? \nI feel for your sister as she needs to trust the person taking care of her child but if they are nearby you have done everything you can to accommodate. \nI\u2019d like to know the age of the child. Are they likely to be noisy and distracting or are they capable of quiet and sensible time. \nI think you need to relax a little maybe say yes for the ceremony but then ask her and her partner to take turns supervising the child in the children\u2019s area.", "YTA because you knew about his condition from the beginning and didn't take that into account when researching and hiring sitters. That means this 100% comes across as excluding your sister and her son because of his disability. You're not obligated to provide sitters when having a child-free wedding, but providing sitters that can only take care of some kids is a massive oversight.", "You have the right to have a child free wedding. In doing so you have to accept the fall out from people who disagree with your decision. You knew your nephew was special needs and needed specialized care yet didn\u2019t find a babysitter who could handle it (but found a sitter for the other kids?). It seems like your intention was never for your sister to attend your wedding.\n\nI\u2019m somewhere between YTA and NAH, I\u2019ll see how your comments shake out and edit later with my final decision.", "YTA. Literally every single other parent has childcare provided for them. It's not possible for your nephew so he's an exception. I cannot imagine ever being so selfish as to worry about my disabled nephew overshadowing my wedding. You're going to permanently damage your relationship with your sister. I'm so sad for your sister that you're not on her side, I genuinely think you're cruel and a bad person.  If it were me and someone tried to make a fuss I'd look them dead in the eye and tell them that my nephew is the exception and if they don't like it they can leave.", "YTA unless you pay for the expensive babysitter who is qualified to keep him safe. You\u2019ve paid for the other babysitters, surely you can pay for his, too. If you really want your sister there, you\u2019ll make it work.", "I support people who want to make their own rules for their wedding, but I also believe there are exceptions to every rule. This is an extenuating circumstance. It\u2019s not a random cousin who doesn\u2019t want to leave her child with a sitter, it\u2019s your sister who CAN\u2019T leave her child with a sitter. You are essentially telling your sister that you don\u2019t care if she\u2019s at your wedding or not. \n\nHonestly, I feel like YTA.", "Technically NTA but yes YTA.", "YTA I was with you untill you disclosures the kid has very special needs. Unless you don't want your sister at your wedding for some reason you are not telling us, there's no way to side with you there.", "Gonna say NAH. She needs to understand your position on your wedding, but also, I'm not entirely unsympathetic to her here. While what you said wasn't anything wrong, I bet what she heard was, \"I know you're already stressed cating for your child, but please spend extra money on a very expensive stranger when its clear you really only trust family.\" \n\nIt's a tough situation, and I don't doubt your sister is naturally predisposed to take the news worse due to her being protective, and the fact that you've basically provided childcare for everyone BUT her. I dont blame you for this\u2014its an extra expense when you're already spending so much\u2014but that's probably how it feels from her side.\n\nA way forward might be to cover or aplit the cost of a specialist if that's feasible for you. If not, I think she's gotta swallow a very bitter pill that not everything is accessible to her and her son, and decide if she's able to cough up the bill or just stay home. This isn't a fun position for anyone, and I hope it resolves well.", "NAH.\nThis is one of those situations where I don't think an asshole is the right term but I still think it would be wiser to just let her bring your nephew. \n\nYou have a right to have a child-free wedding. It's also not your responsibility to provide child care for every situation. So you're not an asshole.\n\nYet I also sympathize with your sister since parents of children with certain disabilities can really struggle to obtain qualified sitters. Often they can't afford it. So I can't say she's an asshole either.\n\nYet, is it really such an imposition to have him there that it's worth ruining your relationship with your sister and nephew? Because here's the thing. Your sister very likely won't come if you don't allow her son to come. That may be important to you or it may not. But 10 years from now, your relationship will likely still be tense because you didn't bend even slightly to help her out. Your nephew will see you as the aunt that cared so much about maintaining a child-free wedding that she couldn't stand to have him there even if it meant her sister couldn't go.\n\nNow maybe he has other things that would make him a disruption, such as calling out at random times or throwing fits, but since you didn't include that, it seems like this is more about wanting to be child-free no matter what.", "I think an exception *can* be made here, specifically because the child is special needs and wheelchair bound. Weddings are usually child-free because they can be loud and rambunctious and distracting. This child will be in one spot, causing very little distraction, and may only require one adult (likely his mother, and trade-offs for her restroom needs) sitting with him. There's lots of down time for guests at a wedding. It's not like she's going to be constantly on the move like you and your fianc\u00e9e. I think your sister would rather be there and also care for her son than be excluded completely. YTA", "YTA", "So sick of brides in this sub acting surprised pikachu face when their siblings with children (especially newborns and children with disabilities) cannot attend their wedding or feel disrespected by their child-free policy. Like CAN WE PLEASE BE SERIOUS?\n\nHave your wedding. Make any kind of rules you want in regards to your guests etc. But don\u2019t be shocked when it causes rifts in your family because said rules are utterly unsympathetic and intentionally exclusionary to the people closest to you. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nHow is a special needs nephew going to be a distraction?\n\nWhat kinda bridezilla are you?\n\nMan, I feel awful for your fiance. Hope he wises up. \n\nYTA. Hugely.", "YTA. You lack empathy and understanding. You care more about a policy than a person. If you had a reason why your nephew would create an issue with your wedding, then there may be a different judgment, but the only thing you mentioned is the rule.", "YTA - For excluding the child. You paid for everyone else\u2019s sitters and accommodated them so they wouldn\u2019t have the hassle of having to find sitters themselves\u2026but didn\u2019t do that at all for your sister, the one who arguably needed that help the most. It feels very targeted and exclusionary.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to make an exception so her child can attend the wedding. But you\u2019re an AH because you *already made an exception* by refusing to accommodate her child when you did so for everyone else.", "NTA only if you don't care if your sister doesn't come. If you plan on holding it against her YTA.", "NAH but I *REALLY* struggled.\n\nI absolutely believe it's up to the bride and groom whether or not to allow children.  You also begin your whole post with the fact that your family has known this since the dawn of time.\n\nWith the fact that a relationship with your sister is so (genetically) close AND the fact the child is disabled a big part of me wants to say let them come.  The other part of me says, if no one else than not your sister's either.  This probably means me, the ahole, but if you didn't want the distraction of any child, it's possible that the presence of one with additional needs would be more of a distraction.\n\nBut then again, you were so gracious you provided childcare at your costs for the other guests. While I think this is super generous, there are now two main venues for wedding and kid's party and your nephew can't attend either.  It almost makes him MORE left out and certainly now the only one who cannot be accommodated.\n\nI understand why your sister is upset and there's so many shades of grey here, I am not sure you can hold it against her.  I would reach out one more time and see if you can reach any middle ground, for example:\n\nI can't afford the specialist care x needs, but fiance and I can offer $___ if that can help to make arrangements.\n\nI know that it's important that X gets proper care, can Cousin Dana and Uncle Todd help with care at the party, so you can enjoy some of the celebration with us?  (Ie, are there family members she trusts that can help, who maybe have a less close connection)\n\nI'm so sorry we weren't able to come to a compromise but we love you both.  After the honeymoon can we come show you and X some pictures.  We'll bring some cake, we really want to celebrate with you.\"\n\nJust think hard and don't leave it where it is.  It's not worth losing family over.  You are protecting your dream and she is standing up for her kid.", "YTA!", "NAH, but be prepared for her not to attend your wedding", "YTA you should 100% find a qualified baby sister and pay for it because you should want your sister there and want your nephew to be safe. It sounds like you don\u2019t like you sister and want her to drop out of the wedding. It\u2019s clearly a safety issue so even a exception for your sister to bring him, I think other guests would understand", "I find kids to be the best part of weddings. They are so cute in their dress clothes, tear up the dance floor and conk out early. Yes sometimes there is crying and shenanigans\u2026 NTA but I can\u2019t help but feel like you\u2019re missing out.", "YTA. This is not a rambunctious child. It is a disabled child with specific care needs. Do you think the child will be making wheelies in the wheelchair? No. How sad you lost a sister.", "YTA. I LOVE that you are providing care and a kid event for everyone else. That's very NTA of you. But special needs means special consideration. I vote kiddo gets to come and the other kids don't.

Equity is being adaptable and fair, not treating everyone the same.", "I think YTA here because your \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be fair to make an exception\u201d reasoning doesn\u2019t really make sense in this case. I really can\u2019t imagine that anyone would be mad to see your nephew who needs specialized care at an otherwise child-free wedding, especially because you\u2019re providing care for everyone else\u2019s kids, which I\u2019m sure most people would probably prefer to taking their kids to the wedding honestly. \n\nAnd to that point, you\u2019re actually the one that\u2019s made them a special case requiring some kind of exception by making a care plan for all of children except this one child. It\u2019s actually you who has made him an exception in one way or another by creating a plan that he is excluded from. I think it\u2019s on you at this point to either find and pay for qualified care from the wedding budget (because you are currently doing that for everyone else\u2019s children except him) or to allow him at the wedding so your sister can attend.", "YTA You know your nephew is a special case & yet you made childcare plans for him as though he could be cared for by the service you found. You know full well that your sister doesn\u2019t leave her son with strangers - and for good reason.\n\nI\u2019m generally fine with the child-free wedding. In this singular case, though, you\u2019re quite aware that excluding your nephew means excluding your sister. Perhaps this was your goal?", "YTA. \n\nThe decision to have a child-free wedding is understandable, and you're absolutely allowed to make the rules for your own wedding day, but in doing so you are 1000% being a huge asshole (to say the least). \n\nFirst of all, it's your sister. A lot of people would've already made acceptions for their nieces / nephews just because they're your sibling's kids, so not even making the acception when you know it's a special case where your nephew needs special care is harsh. Especially since you're okay with excluding your sister from your wedding because you're so determined to keep your \"no children\" rule. \n\nYou're drawing a really harsh boundary here that makes me wonder if you forgot to write the part where you and your sister were estranged, because I can't understand why you would be doing this to your sibling and her special needs child if you had a healthy relationship with them. Her feelings must be really hurt.", "YTA. No one will care. No one.", "YTA\n\nI have a kid with additional needs. Your sister was being kind/optimistic saying suitable sitters are expensive and hard to find. There ARE NONE is what she means. She leaves her son with family usually because they are the only other people on earth she can be sure will be able to care for him adequately.\n\nAnyway I can't believe you have watched your own sister parent her kid and NOT understood that your no kid rule specifically uninvites her from attending. Like you KNEW when you said \"no kids\" you were saying \"no sister\". This is a pretty cowardly way to make sure your sister can't attend tbh, you should've been more up front and straight up told her you don't want her there, but \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f it's your wedding, as long as you don't have the audacity to be annoyed when she doesn't come then I guess you get to be TA.", "What is the specific reason why you don\u2019t want to make an exception in this case?

My wedding is child-free and my family has always known this. I love my nieces and nephews but I feel like having them at my wedding would cause too many distractions. My wedding is a few hours out of the city my family lives in and is in the morning so many people have booked hotels. To try to be considerate to guest with children, I hired some reputable babysitters and rented out a place meant for children\u2019s birthday party\u2019s so parents could drop their kids off somewhere before the wedding without having to find a sitter at home. The problem is my sister (31) has a special-needs child. He is wheelchair-bound and will be for his whole life. He requires very specialized supervision and the babysitters I hired will not be qualified. Because of this, my sister asked me if I could make an exception to my child-free policy so she could watch him and attend my wedding. I told I was very sorry but I didn\u2019t think I should make an exception. I suggested she find a sitter who is qualified and they can even use the same venue the other kids will be using. She told me told me that qualified sitters are very expensive and very hard to find. She also said that whenever she needs a sitter at home, it\u2019s usually somebody else in the family who is familiar with her child\u2019s condition but they will all be at the wedding. I told her it was a no and she called me and AH. I haven\u2019t spoken to her since. Some people in my family are on my side but some are against me and say I should make an exception. So, AITA for not letting my sister bring her child to my child-free wedding?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I personally couldn\u2019t imagine getting married at a traditional wedding and not inviting my nieces/nephews but then I\u2019d probably bugger off and do it without anyone there as I hate people looking at me.

I would grant this exception because the is such a unique situation and it is your sister not some extended family member or friend making the request.", "You're entitled to a child free wedding. The only thing I can think of is to split the cost of a specialized sitter with her?  Either way, my husband's cousin, whom we live, is getting married in a child free wedding. It's also a few hours from home. We went to the bridal shower but said we couldn't go to the wedding. It was very drama free, we understood, his cousin understood, it was fine.

Are you out of your mind?", "Kinda want to go with YTA here because usually people want a child free wedding because they can be little shits, running around and misbehaving.

You are allowed to have whoever you want there (or not).", "YTA. Big time. And ableist. I'm going to guess that you think the presence of someone in a wheelchair will taint your wedding somehow. It doesn't sound like this has anything to do with a potential outburst. You don't mention that your nephew has unpredictable behaviors, and I would assume your sister wouldn't suggest bringing him if this were the case. \n\nYour sister lives an incredibly difficult life. You are excluding her from your wedding by being indifferent to her childcare needs.\n\nBy the way, my older sister had a flower girl who was in a wheelchair.

Special needs babysitters are 15\u00d7more expensive than regular babysitters. Weddings have a budget too. If you're having a child free wedding,it's best to leave the babysitter arrangements to the parents so no one is left out.", "You're well within your right to not want kids at your wedding, that part doesn't make you an asshole.\n I think it's weird to go above and beyond for the other kids and parents at your wedding but not at all for your sister and your nephew who you knew it would be the most difficult for. You really didn't have to do anything for anyone else's kids because people have child free weddings all the time and people can hire their own babysitters usually. What you're doing is weird and even though you're not wrong for wanting to exclude kids from the wedding, the way you've gone about it definitely makes you the asshole.\n\n I feel like you're leaving something out and this is about not wanting your sister there because you clearly knew what was gonna happen.", "Yes to be prepared for the fallout. My wife had a relative who had a child free wedding. We had a 2 children under 3 at the time and one was obviously just a little baby. We had never had anyone but family babysit the baby yet at this point. The family would all be at the wedding. \n\nSo, I stayed home with the kids, while my wife went to the wedding. The bride acted like it was a snub that I didn\u2019t go and my wife had to leave at 11pm. They wanted us to get a hotel room and party late. My wife was breast feeding, she wasn\u2019t going to stay up and party late regardless. Just absolute craziness. We lived close enough to the venue, we figured we would just stay in our own house rather than stay in the hotel. \n\nIt\u2019s just funny because the bride is a mom now and is like super mom, and there is zero chance she would leave her baby with a babysitter to go party at a wedding. We are friendly with them and it\u2019s water under the bridge, but at the time, we were like how are we supposed to not bring the kids and have both of us there.", "Yep. My husband and my best friends just got married. They had a childfree wedding. But guess who was there? My wheelchair bound, medically complex son. They knew that we wouldn't be able to find someone to safely watch him, but they wanted us there, so they made an exception. I guarantee it would cost hundreds of dollars for her to pay a sitter for the day, if she's lucky enough to find someone qualified (odds are low). This would 100% be OP banning sister from the wedding. I actually vote YTA because OP acts like she isn't actually banning her sister from the wedding, because sister can just do [highly improbable solution].", "Basically it.

It was a sh*t show. My family still talk about it negatively a decade later and they spent 100k on this wedding, it was at a castle.\n\nMy cousin's wife made all these decisions, and he used to be very close to my brothers & they are no longer close since the wedding.\n\nChildfree weddings are not worth the headache, and I know I couldn't personally turn my sister away with her child if there are no other options. I also have a brother with special needs and worked with kids with severe disabilities. \n\nI'm not going to judge this one, as I'll just be making it personal. I think OP needs to think about how much she wants her sister to attend, and if holding onto the 'childfree' rule with no exceptions will be worth not having her there.", ">sister is essentially prevented from attending your wedding.\n\nOnly if there is no father in the picture. In case there is, I don't see it as unreasonable to assume that the sister can come. The kids will have more fun in their arrangement and I bet the kid would rather be there, accompanied with his father.", "OP is not the one *ruining* the relationship.", "Agreeing with you here that no reasonable person would see a special needs child (who is also the bride's nephew) and be like \"This is an unfair exception.\" Especially when they were provided free childcare.", "I think another option that might solve all the hard feelings is for *OP* to hire and pay for a special needs sitter for the event. That shows good will and makes it easier on her sister, while preserving her child free wedding.", "Excellent questions", "This is a terrific idea in theory. The kids get to spend the day having a big party while parents relax and enjoy adult conversation. \n\nHowever I may be totally off and reading more into the post but op states that she loves her neice and nephew but she feel they be too much of a distraction. She didn\u2019t say kids in general she only mentions the neice and nephew. \n\nSo here\u2019s my theory. I may be totally reaching but we all do we take one incident on here a dialect it, I think the special needs nephews the one op doesn\u2019t want. Be it maybe she thinks the wheel chair and medical equipment makes too much noise. Be it that her family would flaunt all over him and he would steal some of her spotlight. Or be it sister turns every event into making him the spotlight. Or she is just afraid him being in wedding pics will ruin them. Not sure why I feel he is the reason for the no child rule. \n\nI think op thought the child\u2019s party venue would make her seem less bad in everyone\u2019s eyes. Hiring babysitters where a little icing to make her seem like a wonderful person. But here is the problem op didn\u2019t realize how much a specialized sitter would cost or she didn\u2019t realize how hard they where to fine. So now she has dropped all this money and her sister wants an exception. \n\nIf the senerio is the reason then I think you know the answer weather YTA or not. If you went to all this trouble because you honestly believed the kids would have a better Time then you are NTA. \n\nBut given the venue what can your nephew do with his medical limitations at this venue? And the next thing to consider does nephew know what\u2019s going on around him, because if he does and you expected him to sit in his chair and watch children play around him that is cruel. \n\n\nAt the end of the it\u2019s your wedding. Your entitled to plan and have the wedding of your dreams. Does that mean you don\u2019t have to provide a exception? Yes. Does that also mean your sister has a right to be upset? Yes", ">likely she will not be able to attend your wedding\n\nThere's no way this wasn't the intention. She's not noticed her own sister's life or her own nephew's needs? No way. She just wanted to exclude her sister for some reason.\n\nShe's a double AH because she did it this way so her sister had to be the one to refuse to come, instead of the OP just not inviting her in the first place.", "Agreed. You're paying for qualified care for everyone else, find out how much qualified care for your nephew is, and cover as much as you can.", "It\u2019s certain that any qualified carers, and chances are he will need two people on the day, will want to meet with mum and nephew before the day to go over his care needs. \n\nThis isn\u2019t just going to be a \u201cbedtimes at 8, there\u2019s a pizza in the freezer for you, bye\u201d babysitting job. If big **IF** mum can get carers for the wedding it is going to be terrifyingly expensive and will only become more expensive the higher his care/medical needs are.", "I think that doing something for kids like this is a awesome idea. She can have cake and pizzas for them throw them a great celebration. The kids would have a better time doing this then sitting still for 3-4 hours at a boring wedding. But she didn\u2019t really take her nephew in consideration. Plus I have several questions about nephews condition!:\n\n1- is he able to enjoy the venue with his medical limitations. (Line is this a jumps-zone and you expected him to sit while other kids enjoyed themselves).\n 2- if his medical limitations won\u2019t allow him to enjoy the venue is your nephew aware of his surroundings. Because if he is aware it would have been cruel for him to have to sit and watch other children have a good time.", "Is there any way they can show the ceremony LIVE?

This is exactly right.", "OP's care plan already goes far above and beyond", "Weddings are already super expensive to go to as a guest as well. It's nice she provided childcare for the rest of the family's kids, but the person who probably needs it the most is her sister. Having a disabled child comes with a lot of costs, and telling her basically \"pay a specialized sitter or don't come\" is a pretty cruel thing to do to your sister.\n\nLike, I get child free weddings. But, if it's to the point where you're fine excluding the people you love from a major life event, that makes me think this wedding is more about a party. And imo, that's pretty weird you would prioritize a party over making sure everyone you love can come.\n\nYTA do what you want, but your sister and others in your family will remember this decision.", "And OP doesn't want that hell at her wedding", "This is exactly where I get stuck in the story and on my vote!  It\u2019s not like the special needs are a new development.", "You\u2019re assuming there is a partner.", "For me what clinched it is the fact that OP hired sitters. If she had said it's a child-free wedding and the sitters weren't a thing, I'd be more inclined to say NTA because everyone is expected to make their own arrangements, so sister's situation is unfortunate (because the sitter would be more expensive) but not such a glaring exception compared to everyone else.", "I think my answer was almost exactly this. I agree!", "Special needs kids can be a huge distraction. Loud noises because of excitement or boredom or confusion or just because those are the noises they use to communicate. I've been around a lot of special needs kids and this is something you can expect especially when they are severely disabled to the point where they'd need their own sitter. It's not their fault,  but not wanting that level of noise is actually understandable. People pay a lot for nice wedding videos and that can make the quality lesser. \n\nNow op could certainly help her sister a bit. Maybe they split the cost of a proper sitter or look into respite care and split that cost. There are many avenues op could take to keep their relationship in tact but thats kind of up to op if they actually cares about sisters attendence or not. But op might also be strapped for cash. Perhaps they should go to the family, particularly the family who thinks op should make the exception, and ask them to donate some money into a pool to help out as they say op should. Ten dollars from 10 people is 100$ and that's at least a start. \n\nIt's not like it's a multi-day event either. It's just one evening. I'm sure if they work together they can figure out something. If its so close to the date they can't find proper care I'd actually lay more blame on the sister. Everyone who has a disabled child knows how long it takes to set up this kind of care and weddings are often planned months and months in advanced so the sister was well aware of the issues she'd face and how difficult it might be. She could have done better and dealt with it sooner.", "Where I lean towards YTA with OP is she went out of her way to make special accommodations for all children except her nephew.  She could have discussed with her sister as soon as she had the idea of the different venue with babysitters to try and make it work.  She didn\u2019t though.  That\u2019s where I get stuck.", "Exactly best for the sister to go no contact", "\"It sounds like she wouldn't be able to enjoy your wedding festivities if she brought her son.\"\n\nThat is a huge assumption. Many parents shockingly like being around their children. Not to mention if the sister is making a fuss right now, even if she got a sitter she may be worrying the entire night about her son and not enjoy herself anyway. That's for her to decide what she enjoys", "At least op won't ever see them again.", "Personally, I would be okay with an exception for a handicap bound special needs child being at the wedding and my kid being at a free kid party with babysitters.", "\"One exception is going to lead to another.\"\n\nWhy do people say this?

Deal with it.\" Is it really that hard to do?", "Acting what way?", "Right. Very handicapped kids are not easy to pass off on non-parents to watch. These two have to come as a package deal, or the sister won't come at all.", "Right? Already rolled my eyes when she said that cuz it's like, no you don't. If you did, they would be there.

I mean, logically, it sounds like she will have to be there for her child 24/7 for care, and if he can't come, she can't come.  It's nothing to be upset about.  If anything, your sister is acting a little entitled calling you the AH for not accommodating her.  The world doesn't not revolve around any single person.

It\u2019s hard enough when my own family would budge so I can celebrate such a joyous occasion with them. But again\u2026I know\u2026it\u2019s not your problem.

I don't mean that to come off unkindly but it's really not OK for her to badger and guilt trip you for telling her no.", "I think the comments calling OP selfish for not wanting to have children at her own wedding is really ridiculous. The people inferring that she has nefarious reasons for not wanting a special needs Child who I\u2019m sure is probably not going to be quiet at her wedding or any children, which she specifically specified is crazy to me. She has every right to decide if she doesn\u2019t want noisy kids at her wedding. Most people think that they\u2019re only gonna get married once or at least hope that that\u2019s the case and if they could have it go perfectly without noisy little kids running around being loud or fussy of course why wouldn\u2019t you want it that way? Why is she selfish for wanting that? Also, I think it\u2019s incredibly generous that she set up an easy alternative for parents who couldn\u2019t get babysitters nobody\u2019s talking about that. Obviously OP knows that if her sister can\u2019t get a babysitter or isn\u2019t comfortable leaving her son with the other babysitters, who aren\u2019t qualified then she obviously can\u2019t come or she would have to have her husband if she has want to watch the kid. In life you have to make choices. You either have a child free wedding or your sister is not at the wedding and she can look at the pictures and videos. I think it\u2019s incredibly unfair to call anyone selfish who wants to have a child free wedding. I think the parents who think that the child free wedding should exclude them because their kid is good is just childish and ridiculous. If you get invited to a wedding with a couple of spending thousands and thousands of dollars most likely to create a memory, that will last a lifetime, you have no leg to stand on to try and insist that they change how they want their wedding to be so that you could bring your child.", "NTA, it is your wedding, and it would be unfair to make an exception. I chose not to go with N A H because of sisters reaction, and even a little due to her asking for an exception. I get it, she is a parent worried about leaving her special needs kid, but the point of a child free wedding is for it to be child free", "NTH. I see a ton of comments saying YTH because you knew your nephew was wheelchair bound and didn't think to get a babysitter specialized in this. But I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt and say you didn't know your nephew needed a specialized babysitter (if you can call it that). There are times where others don't know 'special needs' people need something in their lives until they're told or see it themselves. Considering you don't have a kid who is also wheelchair bound, you did not have that knowledge. I am assuming that if you did, you'd have gone out of your way to get one, as you were generous enough to pay for a babysitter for everyone's kids.\n\nIf fixing this problem is something you want, suggest in helping your sister find someone and split the cost at the very least. It's an easy fix and doesn't need to be escalated.", "NTA. Child free means child free.", "Gonna get slammed but NTA \n\nHere is why.\n\nI had a child at 17. He was majorly disabled and had a DNR on him. My sister was getting married and to an emt, so made it extra hard. My dad and I took turns with him outside the wedding even though she made an exception. The reason is that we knew it would cause distraction and disturb the wedding. Machines, screaming, crying, acting out. And it did. He stopped breathing, had a seizure, and screamed for most of it. We DID NOT inform until after honeymoon because the day was about them and NOT my child. \n\nThat's why I say NTA. Because as a parent who had a disabled child. He died at 2 and a half. Have been ln at a wedding\n\n For someone to say need specific care means more than wheelchair and that means the distraction will be major. Not the child's fault, but they happen. Because they don't go into such detail, we don't know how much they act out, how loud they get, and easily bored. Anything like that will not be a baby crying and them leaving the room. It will be melt down and all hands on deck. Essentially, a stop to wedding to Care for child. There  are ways around. If important to be at wedding have child in different room and family alternate as I did so they can all enjoy. \n\nI understand people need to be willing to bend, but knowing how bad things can get, I for one do not blame them for saying no. It is their day and if the actions of the nephew will be as bad as one thinks even if it's just medical is saying that the bride has no right to want the day to be about her and hubby. People calling her the AH think how would you like your day to be stopped for any reason that could have been avoided? Do you know having someone there would cause it? Why is it wrong not to want that to happen?", "NTA, she needs to think about her son.  He will be bored out of his mind.  He will hear from all of the other kids in the family what fun they had at the event center you rented.  As for the family they can go together and pay for a special needs sitter.  It is wrong to make him be excluded from the kids event and force him into the adult event.", "NTA because it\u2019s your wedding.

You're making no attempt to help her. Why can't you pay for a qualified sitter to look after the child? Or maybe let the child attend the wedding if he won't be disruptive. (This depends on his personality and behavior)\n\nYour sister has a difficult situation to deal with, raising a child with special needs, and I can't imagine what that must be like. Why make her life harder?", "YTA  Your sister isn't just being difficult because she wants special treatment, she literally cannot both attend your wedding and keep her child safe because of his special needs.  In so many other ways you have gone the extra mile to accomadate loved ones with kids and there are plenty of people who will tell you that you can do whatever you want at your wedding, but if I knew you in real life I would think less of you for chosing a 100% kid free wedding over your own sister.  It just says something unpleasant about what's important to you.  And if the main worry is that other people will have a tantrum because their little dumpling didn't get to attend then they are ALSO AHs.  Anyone with any common sense  can see that your sister's disabled child is a different case.  Assign an outspoken yet sensible family member to scold any whiners so you don't have to, and let your sister come with your nephew", "YTA...I had a child free wedding also but, your sister has a very special situation here.

What possible distraction would he cause that his mom couldn\u2019t mitigate? I understand not wanting small children at your wedding. Screaming babies stress me the hell out.

Cause the only option she really has right now is to skip your wedding so you don\u2019t have to have kids at your wedding.

But she also had her dream wedding in mind, and she didn't want to compromise her vision.\r  \n\r  \nAs she sipped her latte, her fianc\u00e9, Michael, reached for her hand. \"I know you're torn, Maddie,\" he said softly. \"But remember, this is our day, and we need to make the decisions that are right for us.\"\r  \n\r  \nTaking a deep breath, Madeline replied, \"You're right, but I can't help but feel guilty.\"\r  \n\r  \nPart 3: Reconciliation and Redemption\r  \n\r  \nDays later, Madeline stood outside Veronica's home, her heart pounding as she prepared to face her sister. The air was thick with tension as she knocked on the door, waiting for Veronica to answer.\r  \n\r  \n\"Madeline,\" Veronica said, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. \"I'm sorry for how we left things.\"\r  \n\r  \nMadeline hugged her sister tightly, whispering, \"I'm sorry too, V. I want to find a way for both of us to be happy.\"\r  \n\r  \nTogether, the sisters sat down and discussed possible solutions. Realizing that they couldn't afford a specialized sitter, they decided to approach their family for help. To their relief, their loved ones wholeheartedly agreed to pitch in and make the day special for everyone.\r  \n\r  \nPart 4: A Day to Remember\r  \n\r  \nThe sun shone brightly on the day of the wedding, casting a warm glow on the happy couple and their guests. As Madeline walked down the aisle, she locked eyes with Veronica, grateful for their reconciliation and the support of their family.\r  \n\r  \nAs she reached Michael, he whispered in her ear, \"Love has brought us together, and it has healed the rift between you and your sister. Today is a testament to the power of love.\"\r  \n\r  \nThe ceremony was beautiful, filled with laughter, tears, and heartfelt vows. As Madeline and Michael exchanged their rings, the guests looked on, their hearts swelling with love for the couple and their family.\r  \n\r  \nIn the end, the bond of sisterhood triumphed over adversity, proving that love can conquer all, even in the most tangled of family affairs.\n\n\\-----------------------\n\nA wedding is a fairy tale-like experience, filled with the warmth of passion and a sparkle of enchantment. Yet, every fairy tale threads in adversity that must be conquered before reaching its blissful denouement. It may be time to picture the idyllic happy ending for your wedding story and devote yourself wholeheartedly to bringing it to life. When you share this tale with your children in 20 years, as they embark on the journey of planning their own nuptials, wouldn't you prefer it to have a tender, victorious ending? After all, \"I stood my ground to the end\" isn't a particularly heartening conclusion to a wedding story. Don't perceive this as yielding; rather, view it as an alternative route to achieving a fairy tale wedding story.

I can't imagine not having my niece and nephews at my wedding but to each their own. Doesn't seem like she wants her sister there at all. How self absorbed does a person actually have to be to worry about a disabled child stealing the spotlight.", "Yes my wife\u2019s family gave money - my family bought the stuff on the registry. We went back to our hotel room and counted the money, ordered room service and champagne. Didn\u2019t have sexy times until the morning.", "We didn\u2019t complain to the bride, we just found our work around, which was for me not to come. She had no right to be upset.", "I\u2019m all about people having weddings however they want, and I totally support child free weddings. My wife and I had limited kids at ours because we didn\u2019t want to pay/use up the guest count for 30 some kids that would have been invited if we extended it past immediate family. \n\nThat being said, the people that say they don\u2019t want kids there because they will be a \u201cdistraction\u201d or whatever are either really dramatic or have really shitty families. Every single wedding I\u2019ve been at that has kids at it has followed the same M.O. Kids attend the wedding, have dinner, eat some cake, dance to some songs with their parents/grandparents and  disappear back to the hotel room with one of the parents or older relatives around 8:00. It\u2019s really not that big of a deal. Saying you don\u2019t want them there because of a \u201cdistraction\u201d makes you sound like a bridezilla or like they don\u2019t want their disabled nephew around. Kind of sad if you ask me.", "I agree. She could have got a special needs baby sitter or offered to split the cost. Hes her nephew and she should know what kind of care is required. His care was conveniently left out of the equation and her sister probably feels singled out. It's OPs wedding she can do what she wants but she needs to be prepared for the fallout. \n\nAlso it's a place used for birthday parties? What does the accessibility look like? What will her nephew be able to participate in there (If it's like a sky zone or chuck e cheese I'm guessing not much).", "That's true.", "Ofcourse! But it makes no sense to say that husband would not be capable to take care of their son as someone said.", "If that is the case then yes he would have an amazing time. So I hope this is the case.", "> chucking cheese", "Oh yeah, there's probably no question her sister will probably stay home... But what if her sister makes it anyway?", "I'd be fine with that", "If there's no other day in a woman's life when she gets so be self absorbed, it's her wedding day. I don't believe in all that stupid big fairy tale day bull crap but millions of people still do. It's like those gender reveal things where one of the other kids accidentally ruins it by popping the balloon or whatever and the parents get all pissed. I think gender reveals are dumb, I think weddings are dumb, but the people trying hard to make it so perfect, it means a lot to them (even if I think it's ridiculous) so yeah, depending on exactly \"how disabled\" the kid is, I don't blame OP one bit for not wanting the kid there.\n\nSome kids have a disability that just leaves them in a wheel chair, some of them can't control anything they do and make noise and moan and screech and just suck attention. I don't blame her for wanting the kid there on her big day", "I agree she had no right to be upset.", "I personally don\u2019t have a problem with child free weddings as long as the couple doesn\u2019t get mad because parents can\u2019t make it. As long as there is no hard feeling then, child free is fine.\n\nAnd if most parents where totally honest the only thing a kid enjoys about a wedding is the cake. A wedding isn\u2019t enjoyable to kids. It\u2019s long and boring.", "I think it's more that they are a distraction to the adults generally. When kids are around the adults can't really relax. Have they eaten enough, do they need the bathroom, are they bored, is their nose runny, tired, bored again? \n\nThen at bed time one or both of the guests goes away and generally doesn't come back. Instead of a party ending at 1am, a bunch of guests disappear at 9pm.\n\nAll my friends have toddlers at the moment. It's impossible to have a full conversation , I get it, that's just their stage in life right now. But kids do really shift things.", "\ud83c\udfc5", "Yes, but what if this is the Shots, Shots, and Vows wedding from the other recent post and it absolutely needs to be child-free?", "You are very right op is entitled to her child free wedding m, however like you said her sister probably does feel singled out or even worse feels like her son is being singled out for something he can\u2019t control.  Which has probably caused the sister tremendous hurt.", "Like I said to each their own. I find it ridiculous to worry about a disabled child stealing your spotlight but others won't feel the same.", ">A wedding isn\u2019t enjoyable to kids. It\u2019s long and boring.\n\nA lot of adults feel the same way tbh \ud83e\udd23", "Pretty much. I\u2019ve missed several weddings in the past 5 years as they were child free and I have three kids. I would have gotten a babysitter but the weddings were interstate. It was just too hard to arrange and I wasn\u2019t close enough to the people involved to make it. I\u2019d be annoyed if someone close to me was angry I didn\u2019t attend because of it through.", "When my cousin got married she was disappointed that only 40 people attended her wedding. Mostly her mom\u2019s and grandparent\u2019s generation. The reason most of us sent our regrets: it was a childfree wedding, she was younger than most of us, and we all had children. Our mothers didn\u2019t want to babysit they wanted to go to the wedding. She had more people attend her wedding shower (which children were allowed, all well behaved) than her actual wedding. We weren\u2019t mad about it but when she asked us at the shower if we were attending we had to tell her we couldn\u2019t.", "Oh yeah I agree on that, just be honest on why you don\u2019t want them, saying they\u2019re going to be a \u201cdistraction\u201d is kind of silly. I will say it depends on the age of the kids though as to whether or not they find it boring. The main reason my wife and I chose to do limited kids instead of no kids is that we have quite a few cousins/nieces/nephews in the 6-12 age range. \n\nThe little girls especially were so excited to dress up like princesses and to see their auntie getting married. They also had a blast dancing with their uncles and grandparents for the first hour or so of the reception. Watching how happy they were made me happy we sprung for the additional cost of including them.", "This is also a great point. Having kids at any event not just wedding it changes the total atmosphere.", "I see how that can happen, but that hasn\u2019t been my personal experience with all the weddings I\u2019ve attended in the past few years (I\u2019m at that age, lol).\n\nWhat I\u2019ve typically seen is the out of town college/ high school friend types leave their kids home because they are coming to party, and the rest of the kids usually go home/hotel with an older relative when the time comes, a relative that would already be heading out early. I can acknowledge though that my personal experience isn\u2019t necessarily everyone\u2019s experience. \n\nI\u2019ll reiterate again though that I\u2019m totally cool with child free weddings, my wife and I were very close to doing it ourselves, it\u2019s just this particular case with OP calling them a \u201cdistraction\u201d and them just so happening to have a special needs nephew doesn\u2019t sit right with me.", "Lol, I missed that one but sounds juicy.", "This is true also. I am a homebody. Given the choice of getting dressed up and going to a wedding or staying home  in leggings and baggy shirt curled up with a glass of wine and a good book.  I may love you but I\u2019ll choose the book. Give me legging and  a ponytail over a dress and high heals anyway.  I\u2019d be even happier if you could live stream it and let me watch the wedding from home curled up on the couch!", "The adults can, usually, get drunk at the reception to make up for it", "Yes if you choose to have a child fee wedding then you need to respect the ones that can\u2019t go just like you expect the ones with kids to understand you want a child free wedding. Respect and compassion is a2 way street.", "Which is totally understandable. You have kids. And all of us that have kids have missed things we wanted to attend because kids take priority.\n\nA few years back when my daughter was in high school my husband had a work training at a 5 star resort for 5 days. It was mandatory he had to go but he could have took me and the kids. The kids didn\u2019t want to go they where both old enough to stay home by themselves. (My in-laws live 5 minutes away and my brother lived 3 minutes away.) I was so excited to get to go to this resort. Two days before we planned to live I found out my child was inducted into national honor society. They tried to hide it because they wanted their dad and I to go and enjoy ourselves but one of her friends mom saw me at the grocery store and was talking about how proud she was of our kids for being accepted. I choose to stay home to support her. Husband had to go. I missed a free 5 day stay in a all exclusive resort for a 15 minute ceremony! We all make sacrifices as parents!", "Here you go: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12iqb0m/wibta\\_for\\_backing\\_out\\_as\\_a\\_bridesmaid\\_in\\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12iqb0m/wibta_for_backing_out_as_a_bridesmaid_in_my/)\n\nI think we can all agree that this wedding would be better as a child-free wedding.  And, imo, an adult-free wedding as well, but one can't have everything."]}
