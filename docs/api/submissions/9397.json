I told her calmly, the first 5 times, to please knock before just waltzing into our house, as me and my boyfriend could be doing ANYTHING, because she's walked in on us once before. She does not care.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo this last time, I yelled at her for it. I felt a little insensitive as she is an older lady but, my gears are absolutely grinded when I'm sitting on the couch & this woman randomly comes up & starts to jingle our doorknob trying to get in. It literally send fire through me. I've started to lock the door now & she still comes up here & aggressively tries to turn our doorknob.

How dare she come uninvited into your home, ever. \nAnd why the fuck should you have to lock yourself inside your own home simply to prevent unwanted busybodies from barging in on you.", "Excuus me? I'm (almost) 50 and I would NEVER walk into someones home without at least knocking.\n\nHaving asked nicely 5 times without results you're NTA for yelling at her. And from what you've said, even that didn't work. \n\nGood luck.", "Nta, she's lucky she didn't get hurt just walking in to someone's house.", "NTA\n\nShe may be rude. \n\nHer mental health may be declining as she gets older. \n\nBut from now on, just make sure to lock your door.", "NTA. \n\nAs an \"older\" 50 year old woman, I can assure you I know that is totally messed up. She can jingle all she wants. Stop letting that crazy person in your house.", "NTA.", "NTA, do you have a mental health crisis team in your area? Call them if she does it again and they can sort her out as she either doesn't have the mental capacity to understand, or she's doing it maliciously. Either one should get her on their radar for behavior tracking, and maybe she'll learn her lesson.", "YTA for leaving your door unlocked in the first place. This pushy woman is exactly why locks were put on doors.\n\nAnd you're very foolish if you don't NC these two neighbors. People who would just walk in on your house--even after being told not to--are dangerous.\n\nWhat other lines do these two plan to cross?", "NTA. I would text her partner, \"We have told BLANK repeatedly not to walk into our house without being invited in. She has continued to do so, even after walking in on us having sex. This last time, I had to yell at her, but even so, she's coming by multiple times a day and trying to get into our house, which has led us to locking our door. We do not want BLANK to come over again. And I want to make it very clear that the next time she comes onto our property, we're going to press charges for trespassing. We've been patient, kind, and understanding, but nothing has worked, so this is what we're left with.\"", "Lol, I did not see that. When she said house I assumed she meant a house-house. She could still put it on her porch?", "Well, join the ESH club buddy, because most people on this post think YTAH <3", "Nta, Time to get a super soaker and spray her whenever this happens.", "go to home depot and buy one of those door security bars and lock your lovks", "Omg this just gave me X (the horror movie released in 2022) vibes! So creepy! She just started at you guys having sex?! How did you not confront her partner after that and yell at him for showing her where you live? What does she want and why is she even coming over?", "I\u2019m going to reiterate something because I think I\u2019m so smart lol: whenever we use terms like \u201cyou have every right to\u201d and \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t have to\u201d, we\u2019re almost always trying to control something beyond our control.  As obnoxious as the situation is, the huge things within her control are whether, and how often she locks her door, and whether she posts a no trespassing sign. \n\nThat said, once she does those two things, she can go to the police if the behavior doesn\u2019t stop - and she will have a very strong case.", "Honestly, this sounds like mental illness or early onset dementia. I hate to call the cops, but I wonder if you have some means of kicking off a welfare check. If she walks into the wrong person's house, she could get seriously hurt.", "NTA start calling the cops every time because that is fucking unhinged behaviour", "NTA. Ngl I\u2019d have been screaming and pre-dialing the cops the First time that happened to me.", "NTA.  I get that 60 seems old when you're 20, but this action isn't due to her age.  This lady is one sandwich short of a picnic.  It's a shame that you have to lock your doors now, but you do.  Who knows if she is doing this to other neighbors too.  She could be taking things if you are not in the house as well.", "Next step is to call the police, you\u2019ve made it very clear this person is not welcome in your home, which she keeps coming to. NTA. Being old doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s free other\u2019s boundaries.", "YTA for not locking your door", "It doesn't matter if my door is locked, or unlocked. **Do YOU walk into peoples houses, simply because their door is unlocked? Do you have the entitlement to walk into someones house.. Just because their door is unlocked?** Sounds super superficial. This is our property. That we pay for. I shouldn't have to lock my doors during the day, I've never had to do so before.", "I've tried the kind approach. I've invited him over separately more than once. He says that he mentions it to her but, he doesn't obviously. We did start locking our doors. She just still jingles our door knob, will stand there knocking, while she continues to jingle the doorknob. My father always taught me to respect my elders, which is why I felt horrible for yelling at her. I will 100% admit that I should've been locking my doors but, as stated before, this is a generally safe neighborhood so I never felt the need to. I always felt comfortable having the door unlocked during the day. I'm not some idiot who leaves my door unlocked at night, and when I leave but, when I'm present in the park, I should be able to comfortably leave my door unlocked for easy access for ME.", "Call the cops and file a report every time. NTA.", "Still not ok to aggressively *try* to get in lol these comments", "She's clearly unhinged or has some sort of mental issue, so yes, you do have to lock up. Also call the cops next time for a wellness check.", "Honestly, you need to grow up a little on this. It\u2019s a fucked up world with fucked up people. Other people don\u2019t give a shit what you pay for, an open door is an open door. Tell them to stop or you\u2019ll call the cops. And lock your stupid door so you can\u2019t be interrupted. Like sorry not sorry - you live in society, you\u2019re gonna have to lock up at some point. Are you just gonna wait till your shit is stolen to do so? Be proactive in your life - she obviously shouldn\u2019t be walking in you home but you actually have a way to stop that from happening. ESH", "You said you\u2019re in the south. I\u2019m in KY so I get it. We don\u2019t lock our doors during the day and the only reason we do at night is because my husband is a yankee (I say it with love \ud83e\udd23) and has a stroke if I don\u2019t lock up at night. \n\nNTA even my daddy has the good sense to knock before he walks in, and he has a standing invitation to just show up. \n\nAnd a big ole \u201cBless her heart\u201d from me to your weird ass neighbor", ">It doesn't matter if my door is locked, or unlocked.   \n>  \n>Do YOU walk into peoples houses, simply because their door is unlocked? Do you have the entitlement to walk into someones house.\n\nTotally agreed with this. All the \"you should lock your door\" comments are completely missing the point.\n\nObviously NTA.", "Yup. My first thought was dementia but there are lots of things it could be. OP, you don't have to let that be your problem but it might be worth either calling for a wellness check or telling the neighbor you were originally friendly with that it seems like she is disoriented, partly because it might help her but also because it might help YOU make the intrusions stop.", "Please don't do this. People die on wellness checks because the cops fail people experiencing mental health crises.", "I\u2019m trying to watch my carbs. Thanks for making me think about cake. \ud83d\ude1c", "You're the one who brought it up.", "I would like to keep my door unlocked as well because I come and go a lot too. But there are people in my apartment building who don\u2019t have all their wits about them. You can call that victim-blaming or you can call it embracing what I can control. Your choice.", "Your own situation and decision is not what we are talking about here.  I called your argument victim-blaming because that's what it is.", "NTA.  Being older doesn\u2019t give her the right to not have manners! I\u2019m an \u201colder hippy chick\u201d.  I would not just walk into someone else\u2019s home! Sheesh! I knock on my adult kids doors when I visit!", "NTA.   This is completely unacceptable!  It\u2019s outrageous that she did it once, but several times?!  You have asked nicely, you have told her firmly, and now you have shouted it.  You should get a cease and desist letter from your lawyer stating that she is not welcome.  I don\u2019t know if your male neighbour is aware of all that has happened, but you should talk to him and warn him that this is unacceptable and the steps you have taken and will take if he doesn\u2019t stop her.  Find out if your other neighbours have been visited too.  She doesn\u2019t seem right in the head. NTA", "NTA OP.  Next time she comes around and bothers you, call the police.", "NTA. Trespass her. That's absolutely INSANE behaviour for any child over the age of 5, let alone a full grown adult!", "She is lucky you didn't start throwing things at her (or, that being the US, opening fire....) She has no business just walking into your home.  And continuing to do so after you've told her to stop... I'd be rigging an electric current to the  doorknob to give her a shock every time she tries it (nothing  too strong... maybe something like an electric fence, for cows.)  Maybe she'd learn from that? NTA", "Memories of that bucket lady that was on boru for a while. That was a ride.", "I must have missed that one. Could you tell us about it?", "So much this!! You don't go into someone's personal space without their express invitation. I could leave the front door wide open, and that is still NOT an invitation to enter! People need to stop calling OP the crazy one for not locking doors. Whether or not the door was locked is irrelevant.", "It does matter! Because if your door was locked she would have NEVER got inside without you opening the door. Then you wouldn\u2019t even have this issue. Ofc you\u2019re NTA for not wanting her in your home, but you are a bit daft if you think you don\u2019t need to use the locks for their purpose (keeping unwanted people out of your house).", "They may not want to start that game if they smoke pot or use other drugs in a Southern state.", "Hopefully someone else can find it, idk how. I think it took place in Australia. They had a nosy neighbor who constantly reported them to the local council and was peeking around their property. They set up motion activated sprinklers to catch her up. Don\u2019t remember the details.", "She does sound unwell so it sounds like she needs help in some form? Also OP is allowed to take steps to feel safe, put up alternatives if this is not a viable solution.", "There are these things called...locks. you may have heard of them.\n\nNTA, because it's your house. But you could easily prevent her entrance.", "Youre from the south and all you did was yell? Hell, man, you're being white glive gentle with her. Old, middle age, male, female, you walk into a house uninvited in these parts and it's solved with a bullet and a trip to farmer John's to borrow the backhoe and the pasture.", "NTA. I am 77 and this would not be acceptable in someone my age, much less a quarter century younger. Next time you see him, let him know you will call the police next time she shows up. Then do it.  There's something not right with her, and someone needs to be responsible for her.", "[deleted]", "I didn't interpret their comment as attacking you for what it's worth, sounded more like they were trying to give advice", "NTA. She sounds...odd. \n\nI suspect a bit of dementia or else her brain is fried from substance abuse of whatever kind. When she arrives at your house, does she give a reason for being there? Or does she just turn up and stare? If the latter, there's a mental health issue of some kind.\n\nYou need to pull Carl into this and ask your neighbours if she's doing the same to them. If she is, I reckon she needs more care than Carl can give her.", "Scream in her face. If you scare her she hopefully won\u2019t come back.\n\nIf this is the south then someone is going to eventually shoot her.", "https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/wevvi0/bucket_lady_a_neighborhood_petty_revenge_story/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button this is one of them, but there's a whole bunch of you go to the op's profile", "I'm from the south and my family and I always locked our doors. Sorry we value our safety lol. OP is naive and needs to grow up. Even though her neighbor is obviously in the wrong, after the first encounter anyone with the sense god gave a goat would've locked their doors lol."]}
