He is now following a diet and has a strict eating schedule as part of his health management.\n\n\nThe kids and I eat regular food that I cook everyday. The problem is that whenever we sit to eat, my husband would try to join us. I don't mean join us in eating though he tried it once but swore he wouldn't touch any of the food again. But it was hard to take his word for it. Now he's asking to be allowed to sit with me and the kids while we eat just so he doesn't miss out on this bonding time together as a family. I refused because he might try to get his hands on the food, and also it would be awkeard for him to sit by and watch us eat. He argued that he wants to feel included at the table, and be able to chat with the kids and bond with them. I told him he can do that literally anytime anywhere just not the dining table. The kids and I should be able to eat quietly and peacefully without having to get busy talking. He got mad saying I don't get it and that by not allowing him to join us I'm trying to control what places he can be at and how he bonds with the kids. I refused to discuss it but he threw a hissy fit calling me unreasonable and claiming that I was isolating him because of his condition.\n\n\nAITA for putting my foot down on this? - the kids are 10yo and 13yo.\n\nFew points:\n\n* His eating time conflicts with the kids eating time.\n\n* He tends to violate his diet whenever he's around food that he shouldn't have or that isn't part of the diet. I of course would have to deal with the results.\n\n* all I'm trying to do is make sure both he and the kids are well fed and like I said there's plenty of time for him to bond and have conversations about their day. They can do it anywhere anytime but I think that eating time should be respected.", "created_utc": 1668081999, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yrcy4u/aita_for_not_letting_my_husband_sit_with_me_and/", "score": 373, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s a hard place to be because you are trying to make sure he sticks to what will help his medical condition but you have to also make sure he doesn\u2019t cheat on it either in general. Depending how old your kids are it\u2019s reasonable to not talk a lot during dinner time. There is so much more info I feel is needed to properly judge. Like I\u2019d suggest after dinner or meals or whatever you have the kids sit down with dad and he reads a book or something to them to bond but if the medical condition prevents that\u2026.\n\nI\u2019ll edit when there is more info, atm it be light Y T A since your concern seems the medical condition but again need more info in my opinion", "Yes.

Clearly this is important to him and shutting this down just seems like you hate him or view him as less. It's also really problematic that you aren't listening to him about his condition, but writing him off and excluding him because of it.\n\nEven if he is tempted, that's his choice and lesson to make. You aren't his doctor, give the guy some agency to deal with his medical health.
