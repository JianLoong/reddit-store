The fact that the candidate decided to invite his mom is the candidate's fault. \n\nIf the mother insisted on it, again, candidate's fault for not handling his own mother. Part of being in your early 20s is to create boundaries with your parents. Not being able to, or not knowing you should be doing this, shows a weakness of character and/or poor judgement. \n\nThis is a personal problem that definitely justifies the red flag.

If I was going to use familiar clout, I would do it in that way and not have them directly in the interview room.

As soon as you knew who the third was you should have addressed it and made it clear there would be NO interview with his mom there.", "Umm....if you made the zoom link, can't you kick people out?", "Um, this is a pretty important detail. You would have been completely justified just ending the interview right then and there when she started cursing you out.
