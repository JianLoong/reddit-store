If he needed his mommy on the call at this age, he is clearly unsuitable for anything you have to offer.", "In general, NTA. I hope you recorded the convo to show to yr supervisor. It should be simple enough; you didn't get to hear the student speak. Ask your supervisor what you could've done.\n\nI am wondering why you didn't just interrupt the mother and say you need to hear from the son. Perhaps that's what the supervisor meant.", "Couldn't you have muted the mom so that the interviewee could be, er interviewed?", "NTA. This is a 21 year old man!

The student (and his Mom) should 100% understand that she ruined his chances for the internship. He shares some of the blame as well for not cutting the apron strings. \n\nI have interviewed people for intern and entry level type positions.

No.  There is NO way I would consider a 21-year old for any type of job or internship if they had mommy participate in the interview.  He clearly is not mature enough and mommy would be nothing but trouble to any employer.  As an HR Manager, I had a potential employee come in for an interview with his mother - same type of situation.

Except in the most rare of exceptions where mom has serious pull.  NTA.  You handled it the well all things considered.  You were already more than accommodating by going over the allotted time because of her.", "NTA. and totally wild and inappropriate of the mother and son - who is an adult. Shocking that your supervisor said you should be more accommodating, shocking.", "The moment a parent showed up in an interview would be the moment I would ask them to leave. If they didn't, I would terminate the interview, thank them for their time, and move on.\n\nEdit to add judgement.  YTA.  You're not TA for asking the mom to let him talk. As an interviewer it's YOUR job to keep things on track and you should have done it from the outset; she shouldn't have been there in the first place and you should have muted her mic.", "Jeesh nta \n\nTalk about the coddled years", "NTA.

At 20 you\u2019re an adult and you need to do interviews by yourself I mean I had a job at 16 and had to go to an interview by myself. Needing mum there really shouldn\u2019t be accommodated because it shows lack of independence. Mum also seems super unreasonable seeing as she started shouting at you when you recommended she shouldn\u2019t be in the interviews I don\u2019t think anything you could have said would have accommodated that and she\u2019d send angry emails regardless", "NTA you obviously didn't have to say anything about it but i feel like for the son it's good for him to hear any sort of feedback from people that aren't his mom. I feel bad for this guy it sounds like his mom is robbing him of some valuable experience. \n\nOn a professional level based on your supervisor's response it's maybe best to prioritize not creating conflict by giving unsolicited advice to people who might not take it well, but it doesn't make you an AH", "Off topic, but an essay AND 3-4 total interviews? Jesus fuck lol", "I would invite your supervisor to interview the dynamic duo himself if he's concerned about the lack of recommendation from you.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but you should have given the student a second chance.

The dude needs to set some boundaries with his mother. The interview was for him not his mother.", "Why didn\u2019t you just remove her from the Zoom?", "YTA for not saying that at the outset. You could have asked her to leave or end the interview, but instead you let her take over and the poor candidate didn\u2019t get a look in", "I think you and the mom are an AH tbh. The minute you saw his mom in the interview and taking over you should of stopped right there and told them that either she leaves or the interview won\u2019t continue. Flagging him was also a bit extreme. I\u2019d reach out to him personally to see if he needs help his mom sounds like a helicopter parent. His mom is obviously an AH because she is clearly hindering her child\u2019s future not helping it and cussing you out was in called uncalled for.", "ESH??  I'm not sure why you didn't just tell the mom she couldn't be on the call from the get go??  You're the one running the show, yeah?", "YTA, this is your job, you should have taken control of the interview from the beginning and after the first time, stopped her and said, \u201ci appreciate your perspective but we really must hear directly from the student in this interview.\u201d \n\nyou also should have given a 5 min warning and ended the interview on time, by letting it go to twice the allotted length you enabled the entire thing to get even further out of hand. \n\nnow you are penalizing the student bc you did not manage the interview appropriately, including giving the critique at the end when it was too late for them to course correct.", "ESH, shouldn\u2019t flag him op.

It's better that someone tell her off now so they can at least *try* to start setting healthy boundaries between them. Because otherwise this kind of behavior will ruin that poor kid's life.\n\nAs for your supervisor thinking you could have handled things differently, perhaps ask them what you *should* have done in that situation. After all, the mother wasn't the one being interviewed and didn't actually have the right to be there. You *did* accommodate the two by letting her join in the first place. And you ended the call once *she* starting getting extremely inappropriate (there are very very few things that would justify her cussing at you and giving polite feedback about how the student would fare better in future interviews is not one of them).\n\nUnfortunately, it's not uncommon for supervisors to tell an employee to \"do better\" when they receive a complaint.

The moment the mom showed up you should have shooed her off. She will not be able to control her son once he is in college, and you could have gotten to know who he is with her out of the way.

I wouldn't give him the internship either.  Is she going to show up to work with him too?  Ridiculous.", "NTA but you should've ended the interview or told her she couldnt be on it.

It\u2019s a red flag in itself that the student even allowed his mom or thought it would be ok for her to be there. That\u2019s why they have pre-screening interviews.

Essay I don't get, but for an internship I guess it makes more sense?", "If the kid was under 18, I'd be more inclined to agree simply because he likely wouldn't have any other option as a minor. But at some point, the kid has to start setting healthy boundaries if the parent won't. It's not *fair* that the kid has to take on that responsibility but employers shouldn't have to be the ones to accommodate him, especially when mommy is the type to start cussing when she doesn't get her way.\n\nI say that as someone who had bit of a helicopter mom too.", "If he can\u2019t deal with his mom he can\u2019t handle working in a professional environment. He already showed he\u2019s not a good candidate he doesn\u2019t just deserve a second chance", "That's not really his job though. It seems like this is the kind of interview where the candidate is allowed to bring other parties \"professors, etc.\" to give a testimonial basically. The fact that the candidate decided to invite his mom is the candidate's fault. \n\nIf the mother insisted on it, again, candidate's fault for not handling his own mother. Part of being in your early 20s is to create boundaries with your parents. Not being able to, or not knowing you should be doing this, shows a weakness of character and/or poor judgement. \n\nThis is a personal problem that definitely justifies the red flag. I wouldn't want to hire someone distracted by a volatile relationship, gambling/drug problems, legal issues, etc. Helicopter moms fall in the same red flag bucket as far as I'm concerned.", "Agree.  You should have asked the mother at the beginning of the interview to leave the two of you alone so you could have a 1:1 interview.", "Yes, OP should have asked the mother to leave from the outset. She had no business being there at all.", "Yes, this. He let this go on way too long!", "Agree... the interview should have stopped until the mother left. And it should really be school policy that interviews do not include parents! \n\nThe student may not be appropriate for the internship given that he also allowed his mother to participate (at least I assume that's how she got in). Or the student foolishly sent the email to his mom to celebrate the interview and she barged in. They may deserve another chance if she horned her way in without them knowing or approving beforehand.", "OPs not the asshole it\u2019s a prestigious position and the son is clearly not qualified if his mom is interviewing for him. OP doesn\u2019t owe the student to continue the interview process they failed the first round", "Poor Dave though, with a mother like that trampling all over his chances!", "Allthough i think it's not OP's responsibility to deal with this overbearing mother, i too think they should've booted her out of the conversation at the first minute.", ">now you are penalizing the student bc you did not manage the interview appropriately,\n\nI mean..he does seem incapable of speaking by himself", "Found the mom", "The supervisor probably took issue with the fact she allowed this to go on for a full hour without saying anything and gave criticism afterwards opposed to handling the situation at the start of the interview.", "Nothing would surprise me, but I find often these kinds of people are so clueless as to how their actions affect others", "Only problem is, since mum is already harassing the staff at a place her son doesn\u2019t even work at yet I\u2019d be worried that any more attention would just encourage her further. \n\nI mean, can you imagine the tirade if he had a bad day at work or something? \n\nBy giving honest feedback, OP has given the opportunity for him to reevaluate his (and more importantly his mother\u2019s) approach before he applies to any other opportunities", "This is true for the more subtle cases.  If I was going to use familiar clout, I would do it in that way and not have them directly in the interview room.  If I was an interviewer I would take issue with anyone other than the interviewee outside of a translator or a person who has to physically help them get about.  OP probably should have booted mom out immediately, but I don't know their policies or if there are any that exist for such occurrences.", "I mean I guess it just depends. My career job took 2 pretty informal interviews so I assume it depends on industry, company, hiring manager, etc.", "Yes, having professors join is sort of a weird format, but I\u2019d view that as more of a professional reference. Instead of writing a letter, they do it via video. Not something I\u2019ve seen before, but very different from having a parent answering questions.", "I don\u2019t know if that would have worked because she called me a f.cking b.tch repeatedly after I told them he should do his interviews himself.", "Oh, he was going to get penalized anyway, but I agree that OP should have controlled the situation and not let her speak well over the alloted time", "You can add that caveat too - \"I can reschedule you once, but I cannot again and you will be disqualified from candidacy if this happens again.\"\n\nThen spell it out clearly for him at the next interview - \"Visitors, including your mother, will not be allowed on site. If she causes repeated incidents that may jeopardize your employment.\"", "Outside of functional aid like you mentioned, I can't think of a reason over the age of 18 where you'd have a co-interviewer (not counting multiple-candidate group interviews).", "My first had 2, an internal role I applied to at that same company had 6. Second company had 6 30-minute blocks and 2 1-hour blocks over 2 days. Current one had 3 45-minute interviews on 3 days over 3 weeks, with a quick check-in with the HM after every one.", "Maybe not, but to cover yourself from a business perspective, you have to keep it professional.", "So you kick her out. You end the interview immediately and tell Dave you\u2019ll reach out to reschedule just the two of you. \n\nI\u2019m genuinely shocked that you just let that happened and then were surprised when you said simmering at the end and she was upset. As soon as you knew who the third was you should have addressed it and made it clear there would be NO interview with his mom there.", "Umm....if you made the zoom link, can't you kick people out?", "Um, this is a pretty important detail. You would have been completely justified just ending the interview right then and there when she started cursing you out. Wow.", "Contacting him privately in an email would have been the best way to handle this. Especially since you didn't say anything for the whole long interview and allowed her to be here.", "I agree too, i'm just saying the student wasn't penalized because of op", "That's what I was wondering - or at least mute her as the host?", "Ya he was penalized because he brought his mom to an interview. What kind of thinking is that? Immediately move on to the next candidate"]}
