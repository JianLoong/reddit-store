I say this is selfish and unfair but opinion among the guests is divided*\n\n----\n\nAt the end of October last year my brother got engaged and they were going to have the wedding in Mexico (we live in the UK or reference). It's at the end of November of this year. They gave 13 months notice so anyone who wanted to go could plan. They also told everyone the name of the resort and what the price was so people could budget. They said they would get their code for the resort at the end of June, 5 months before the wedding. So people could book a room at the resort in the block reserved for my sister/her fianc\u00e9. The code would give people a discount.\n\nI think an overseas wedding is huge ordeal for the guests. Everyone they are inviting lives here in London or right outside the city. Since he's family and it's an important day for him and he wants me there I bit my tongue, sat down and went over my finances so I plan put how to afford everything. Most people who want to go have arranged time off from their jobs and booked their flights. \n\nAt the end of April (7 months before the wedding) my brother and her announced they are changing resorts. The dates are the same, and it's still in Cancun so no one has to change their time off or their flights HOWEVER this resort costs more than the other one **(Edit: almost \u00a31500 more into total.)** It will cost less for my brother and her but cost more for the guests. \n\nI told my brother and his fianc\u00e9e that this was a really selfish and unfair thing to do the guests. People planned based on the price of the old resort. I have to go over my finances again to make this work.\n\nI thought saying how unfair this is was obvious. However everyone who is invited to the wedding is divided. Half are like me and think it's unfair and selfish. The other half say there is nothing wrong with my brother and his fianc\u00e9e wanting to save money if they can.\n\nNo one who is invited has enough money that they can afford this without planning and budgeting. It's not as though they can just afford it no problem. It's already an ordeal for people to take a week off work, take a 10 hour flight across the ocean and spend a lot of money on flights and resorts and other things. Now they're telling us we have to pay more than we were originally told. Besides the discount code for the resort, my brother and his fianc\u00e9e are not paying for, or assisting anyone at all financially with any of the costs associated with going to the wedding. They declined having a reception or anything here, they are only doing wedding things in Mexico.\n\nIf I'm wrong about this I'll have the good grace to apologise to my brother and his fianc\u00e9e. He's very angry at me. Opinion among those invited is divided so I would like to hear from people who aren't involved.
