I say this is selfish and unfair but opinion among the guests is divided*\n\n----\n\nAt the end of October last year my brother got engaged and they were going to have the wedding in Mexico (we live in the UK or reference). It's at the end of November of this year. They gave 13 months notice so anyone who wanted to go could plan. They also told everyone the name of the resort and what the price was so people could budget. They said they would get their code for the resort at the end of June, 5 months before the wedding. So people could book a room at the resort in the block reserved for my sister/her fianc\u00e9. The code would give people a discount.\n\nI think an overseas wedding is huge ordeal for the guests. Everyone they are inviting lives here in London or right outside the city. Since he's family and it's an important day for him and he wants me there I bit my tongue, sat down and went over my finances so I plan put how to afford everything. Most people who want to go have arranged time off from their jobs and booked their flights. \n\nAt the end of April (7 months before the wedding) my brother and her announced they are changing resorts. The dates are the same, and it's still in Cancun so no one has to change their time off or their flights HOWEVER this resort costs more than the other one **(Edit: almost \u00a31500 more into total.)** It will cost less for my brother and her but cost more for the guests. \n\nI told my brother and his fianc\u00e9e that this was a really selfish and unfair thing to do the guests. People planned based on the price of the old resort. I have to go over my finances again to make this work.\n\nI thought saying how unfair this is was obvious. However everyone who is invited to the wedding is divided. Half are like me and think it's unfair and selfish. The other half say there is nothing wrong with my brother and his fianc\u00e9e wanting to save money if they can.\n\nNo one who is invited has enough money that they can afford this without planning and budgeting. It's not as though they can just afford it no problem. It's already an ordeal for people to take a week off work, take a 10 hour flight across the ocean and spend a lot of money on flights and resorts and other things. Now they're telling us we have to pay more than we were originally told. Besides the discount code for the resort, my brother and his fianc\u00e9e are not paying for, or assisting anyone at all financially with any of the costs associated with going to the wedding. They declined having a reception or anything here, they are only doing wedding things in Mexico.\n\nIf I'm wrong about this I'll have the good grace to apologise to my brother and his fianc\u00e9e. He's very angry at me. Opinion among those invited is divided so I would like to hear from people who aren't involved.

At this point I'd say send your well wishes, a moderately priced gift, and put that money towards your actual living expenses instead of an elaborate vacation you don't even want.", "I personally think most destination weddings are selfish and unfair.", "NTA I personally think destination weddings can be selfish depending on the finances of the families, this is way too far. I wouldn\u2019t go.", "NTA.  Mexico is dangerous and corrupt. You\u2019re not safe off the resort properties. There are plenty of gorgeous areas to hold a wedding in Europe. Save your money for something more important.", "NTA. I\u2019m snarky and hope their guest list dwindles significantly. That\u2019s terrible what they\u2019re expecting from everyone from a destination wedding to an unexpected price hike, to a registry. Ugh! I\u2019d cancel.", "NTA.  Destination weddings are expensive, and I've never heard of anyone (who wasn't tacky) expecting gifts on top.  It's unfortunate your brother and SIL changed venues but if it's less expensive for them I can understand.  What would make them the AH is if they don't understand why many guests now have to back out due to finances.", "nta. I throught that it should be payed by people getting married, not by guests.... the audacity", "NTA, I would say that to your brother that your regret that you will not be able to attend.", "NTA. My friend and their spouse were forced to do a destination wedding, as their families couldn't get visas to either of their home countries. So they picked a destination that everyone can get to visa-free with many budget options for hotels. And no registry. Attendance was the gift they wanted. This couple could stand to learn some gratitude.", "NTA. An extra 1500!!!!! I believe one should have their wedding anywhere they want and however they want.  But. They have to accept the no from people who don\u2019t want to take vaca time for someone else\u2019s wedding and spend so much on someone else\u2019s wedding.  I would decline.  Even if it\u2019s a sibling.  I wouldn\u2019t want to use my vaca time and money on this when I use it for my whole family to go on vacation.", "1st stay at the resort you booked. You don't need to stay at the new one . Noone has to. Plus check the distance between resorts.  It's probably very short . Maybe walking distance and your brother is the AH...not you", "NTA. I wish people would stop expecting others to spend so much money on them or celebrating them. Weddings are a lot of money anyway, making it destination is so selfish, then expecting gifts. So wrapped up in themselves it\u2019s pathetic.", "NAH. Just book for a cheaper hotel and get a day pass for the actual wedding day. I got married in Cancun, and guests just stayed in cheaper hotels and visited mine for the day.", "NTA. I don\u2019t know the tone of the conversation so maybe they reacted harshly to being critiqued rather than the sentiment itself, but it is selfish of them to spring with so little notice and maybe I\u2019m biased but I think destination weddings are insaneeeee unless you\u2019re eloping with small party. Also, London to Mexico for a wedding???? \n\nAlso - Cancun? Really? Is it on spring break?  So many nicer resorts to choose from\u2026", "YTA the wedding is for the bride and groom.  If you don\u2019t like the resort/cost then don\u2019t go.  Many people opt for a destination wedding just so they don\u2019t have to deal with limiting the guest list.  The guests will do the slimming themselves.  A destination wedding isn\u2019t intended to be 200 guests it\u2019s usually 50 at most usually less.  When booking a destination wedding there are perks for the bride and groom so it\u2019s better for them to shop around.  Now it doesn\u2019t prevent the rest of the guests from staying at another resort. You can stay where you choose but the wedding will be held at the one the Bride and groom choose.\n\nDon\u2019t like the new resort -  don\u2019t go\nDon\u2019t like the new cost - don\u2019t go\nDon\u2019t like they aren\u2019t having a reception at home - don\u2019t buy a gift.  See how easy that was\u2026", "The new resort only allows people staying there on the grounds or inside. It's on their website and when I called the resort to confirm they said there is no exception even for weddings. It's for security reasons.\n\nSo yes I would have to stay at that resort if I wanted to go to the wedding.", "Oh and NTA, cancel the wedding and tell them not everyone has a moneytree in the backyard.", "The resort does not allow people who are not staying there inside or on the grounds. It's on the website and the resort confirmed when I called them. They don't make any exceptions including weddings. This policy exists for security reasons.", "I have never been to a wedding that wasn't in London. So ever other wedding I've ever been to has cost me nothing except for the cost of a gift. I've also never been to a wedding that isn't on a weekend or holiday so I've never needed to book time off work for one.\n\nThis is all new to me. In this case my brother and his fianc\u00e9e are not helping anyone with any costs, including the wedding parties. Except for the discount code to book at the resort.", "I do need to stay at the new one. The new resort does not allow anyone on the grounds or inside unless they are staying there. It's on the website and I called the resort to confirm this. The resort said no exceptions even for weddings.\n\nAlso the resorts are not close and I would not leave the resort and walk around by myself. I am a tourist and don't know the language. That would be daft and it's not safe outside the resort.", "The resort they are staying at does not do day passes and does not allow anyone on the grounds or inside unless they are staying there. It is on the website and I also called the resort to confirm this. There are no exceptions even for weddings. This policy is for security reasons according to the resort.", "OP said most people had already booked their flights and taken time off. Those are expences they might not be able to take back so yes, then you ARE selfish to change your venue to a much more expensive one.", "Do you have to stay in the resort the entire time or can you just visit for the wedding and stay somewhere cheaper the rest of the trip? NTA in any case.", "That's a fking dick move imo. So, what about the plane tickets? what's the point if all the guests aren't gathered in same plane? Where's the fun of being together of destination wedding? We had a full on blast 2 days of traveling. How are they supposed to go after exiting from the airport, by themselves without any cars/ taxi / bus for them to drop off? \n\nRather this looks like too much labor to even attend the wedding... with the things going on, is everything even prepared properly and being thought of? Usually you need others perspective and ideas when planning any family function. Imagine not pondering, but brushing off, when you're actually raising such a crucial point ..", "guess they haven\u2019t heard about the cost of living crisis that\u2019s ruining everyone\u2019s fucking lives", "Can you just stay at the other resort? Most of the resorts are all on the same short strip.", "I wonder if it is required to stay at the resort that the couple is staying in? Like what would stop guests from staying at the previously chosen resort and just going to the wedding. I know they have a discount code but without that code, it would probably be cheaper than 1500 more for the other place. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t go either way since it was a dick move to change it this late in the game and it seems like they don\u2019t care about everyone else\u2019s hardships. I mean, it\u2019s their wedding so do it their way but don\u2019t be butthurt when no one can come.", "You said destination weddings are really selfish and I disagree for the reasons stated.", "I have to stay at that resort for a minimum of 5 days. I booked 7 days off for the trip.\n\nI also would not stay at a resort where I didn't know anyone, while everyone else was someone else.\n\nThe resort doesn't allow people inside or onto the grounds if they are not staying there. There is no exception, even for a wedding.", "No. Firstly the resort does not allow anyone inside or on the grounds unless they are staying there. Besides being on the website, when I called the resort to confirm they said there are no exceptions even for weddings. This is for security reasons. \n\nEven if they let others in my brother and his fianc\u00e9e's block of rooms and discount code have a minimum of a 5 day stay. I can't stay less than that. I also wouldn't bother going all the way to Mexico if I wasn't at the same resort of my brother and everyone else.", "The new resort does not allow anyone who isn't staying there on the grounds or anywhere inside. It's on the website and I called the resort to confirm. There are no exceptions even for weddings. This is for security reasons. The new resort is not near the old resort, and I would not leave the resort to walk from one to another anyway. That is not safe.", "It is required. The new resort does not allow anyone on the grounds or inside unless they are staying there. There are no exceptions for weddings. I confirmed with the resort.", "Well they are, especially when you also expects gifts. Most people don't want to spend their holiday for someone else's wedding but they do it out of love for the bride and groom. But respect that love. OP's brother did NOT!", "Oof. If you haven't already booked the flights, I'd consider trying to get those days back from work (or pick a closer destination for a holiday). \n\nIf you have bought the tickets, maybe just turn it into a nice holiday (visit the pyramids and all that). There might even be some other potential guests in the same position who will join you.", "That sucks but Cancun is safe bro. The Cartels use it to launder their money and will not let a tourist get hurt.", "No one should force anyone to attend their destination wedding. No one should compromise the wedding of their dreams for other people. In this situation the couple is wrong for changing locations and expectations, but on its face destination weddings are not selfish. It\u2019s selfish to call a couple selfish for having the wedding then want. Also having a registry when you have a destination wedding is usually for people who can\u2019t attend and ask if they can send a gift instead.", "The registry is for everyone. When they got the registry they emailed suggestions off it to people who confirmed they are coming to Mexico.\n\nMy suggestion was a \u00a3300 blender. My sister's was a \u00a3280 coffee machine."]}
