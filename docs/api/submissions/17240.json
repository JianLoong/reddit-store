I say this is selfish and unfair but opinion among the guests is divided*\n\n----\n\nAt the end of October last year my brother got engaged and they were going to have the wedding in Mexico (we live in the UK or reference). It's at the end of November of this year. They gave 13 months notice so anyone who wanted to go could plan. They also told everyone the name of the resort and what the price was so people could budget. They said they would get their code for the resort at the end of June, 5 months before the wedding. So people could book a room at the resort in the block reserved for my sister/her fianc\u00e9. The code would give people a discount.\n\nI think an overseas wedding is huge ordeal for the guests. Everyone they are inviting lives here in London or right outside the city. Since he's family and it's an important day for him and he wants me there I bit my tongue, sat down and went over my finances so I plan put how to afford everything. Most people who want to go have arranged time off from their jobs and booked their flights. \n\nAt the end of April (7 months before the wedding) my brother and her announced they are changing resorts. The dates are the same, and it's still in Cancun so no one has to change their time off or their flights HOWEVER this resort costs more than the other one **(Edit: almost \u00a31500 more into total.)** It will cost less for my brother and her but cost more for the guests. \n\nI told my brother and his fianc\u00e9e that this was a really selfish and unfair thing to do the guests. People planned based on the price of the old resort. I have to go over my finances again to make this work.\n\nI thought saying how unfair this is was obvious. However everyone who is invited to the wedding is divided. Half are like me and think it's unfair and selfish. The other half say there is nothing wrong with my brother and his fianc\u00e9e wanting to save money if they can.\n\nNo one who is invited has enough money that they can afford this without planning and budgeting. It's not as though they can just afford it no problem. It's already an ordeal for people to take a week off work, take a 10 hour flight across the ocean and spend a lot of money on flights and resorts and other things. Now they're telling us we have to pay more than we were originally told. Besides the discount code for the resort, my brother and his fianc\u00e9e are not paying for, or assisting anyone at all financially with any of the costs associated with going to the wedding. They declined having a reception or anything here, they are only doing wedding things in Mexico.\n\nIf I'm wrong about this I'll have the good grace to apologise to my brother and his fianc\u00e9e. He's very angry at me. Opinion among those invited is divided so I would like to hear from people who aren't involved.

If I'm going to spend 12 months saving for something, its going to be something I want to do.\n\nI dunno, I don't get destination weddings in general. Only time it makes sense to me is if the bride and groom are going to pay for all the guests to travel. Expecting people to take international trips for your wedding is just crazy imo.", "Can you book a cheaper room at the resort outside of the bride and grooms block? I assume they get a discount on their stay based on their guests stay.", "NTA... Feel free to back out and take the vacation you want. It's an invitation not a summons", "I'm assuming this is an additional 1500/couple, not per person,  right? So what about the families who need 2 rooms? That's \u00a33000 additional. If they did it before people started buying flights, it would have been one thing, but to do after flights were purchased, it just another. \n\nI have a feeling your brother needs to be ready for a much smaller guest list. People don't take kindly to be used to subsidize other people's finances.", "NTA. Can you just take a car service to their resort for the wedding and save yourself the cash? It will suck to be separated from the other guests, but it also might be nice to do your own thing.\n\nOtherwise, skip it. If they want everyone to attend, a destination wedding is a bad choice (venue change or not)", "Thank you for the invitation . Unfortunately I am unable to attend. Have a great time!", "Just want to clarify that destination weddings are only selfish if you are expecting everyone to show. If you are having a destination wedding because you love the location and don\u2019t care whether or not people make it because the location of your wedding is what matters to you, then yea it\u2019s still selfish, but in a reasonable manner. Weddings are about the couple at the end of the day. They deserve to be selfish. This is not one of those cases where it\u2019s about the location as it\u2019s one of the thousands of Cancun weddings, but I was just saying.", "I get the feeling you care more about him than he does you. \n\nWould you insist someone you love scrimp and save to attend your expensive overseas wedding?", "It\u2019s common with destination wedding packages at resorts that the wedding is comped IF the couple can secure a certain number of bookings of guests. So if everyone cancelled then yes, the couple would suddenly be on the hook for the whole thing. Of course, they don\u2019t tell all their friends and family that!", "Since the couple save money they could offer to cover some of the cost for their guests. As a nice gesture.", "They are out of their minds and need a reality check then", "That is the one valid reason for a destination wedding, you have a connection. We were invited to a destination wedding in the bride's hometown/homecountry. But they paid for the stay, the guests only had to manage the trip (Europe, NOT oversees so we had options on how to travel). They also welcomed our two young children. \n\nYes, the wedding is about the couple, but deliberately making it difficult and expensive for the guests IS still selfish.", "I stayed at the Hard Rock in Cancun last May for a bachelorette party. They did not allow anyone other than registered hotel guests. On the beach, they had armed guards checking wristbands; the hotel was gated with armed guards checking each car; it was like a fortress. We also had a minimum 3-night stay.", "You've never been to an all inclusive in Mexico, I'm assuming.", "Have you tried telling him that you really want to be at his wedding, but need \u00a31500 from him to make up for your budget shortfall? If it is important to him for you to be there, he will give you the money. At the very least he might offer a loan to be paid back at your leisure, although I'd be disappointed if he offered that instead of giving you the money with no strings attached.", "Coming back to comment one more thing about this:\n\nSome people get their perspective distorted about weddings and specially about their own weddings, in a what that makes them balloon in importance to the point where NOTHING is more important than the wedding, and the thought that other people may have other priorities or needs that come before the wedding simply doesn't come to their mind.\n\nMaybe this is what's happening to your brother, and he's simply taking for granted that everyone will drop anything and put on any amount of money, time and effort to make his wedding work for him and it hasn't crossed his mind that he's placing an unfair burden on you (and your family) by making it so costly while also demanding their attendance. \n\nIf this is the case, the first thing you'd need to do is make it clear to him that he's sacrificing things for the wedding, including everyone else's money, their time, and his relationships with them simply because he's got so bent on having his wedding in Mexico and having everyone attend there. \n\n(This is the charitable interpretation, by the way. The uncharitable one is that he's aiming to make everyone else pay for his wedding and only cares about having your wallets in attendance. But I'm gonna give him as much benefit of the doubt as I can)", ">So when my brother said to me that this is \"important\" to him, and as his brother I'm \"important enough that I want you to be there\" (exact words) he was lying and doesn't really think that?\n\nYes, if it was that important to him, he'd have his wedding somewhere within driving distance for you (and everyone else).", "He's not lying per se. However, he's so blinded by the whole \"my wedding/my needs/me/me/me\" theme pushed by the wedding industry - probably reinforced by his bride - that he is completely blind to the reality of what he's asking (or demanding). Brides and grooms can sometimes lose all contact with reality when it comes to wedding planning - all the while having their temporary insanity stoked by a huge industry designed solely to remove large amounts of money from temporarily brainwashed people. The end result is that people in your position are hurt in the name of wanting to make loved ones happy. It's quite sad. And highly manipulative. \n\nIt would be interesting to see how many of the guests who are upset about the change would be negatively impacted by it, and how many who are not upset are able to more easily absorb it.", "That's cool. Question: Did you put not expecting gifts or anything to that effect, verbally or otherwise?  Just curious. Thank you!", "Why would it be an asshole move to check what others think about this change?", "Probably not 100. And it\u2019s not the suite, it\u2019s the wedding package itself that they\u2019re trying to cover. But yes, this is absolutely the game that the resorts play with wedding couples.", "I\u2019ve dropped a decent amount for a destination wedding for a dear friend while I was financially comfortable. \n\nExcept she had to find me a guest to room with. I was NOT paying the single supplement rate!", "I agree with you. It's really not dangerous there, unless you're completely clueless.", "can't tell the downvote brigade nothing.", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t go. Take the money you would have spent and throw an inexpensive party for them when they get back, that the other locals who can\u2019t go can attend", "They don\u2019t seem to be refunding the flight money people already spent.", "\u00a31500 per adult guest. I don't know what the price is for children.", "Yes I am sure that is the price.\n\nThe prices at the resort are also higher than that without a discount code.", "The new resort doesn't allow anyone inside or on the grounds unless they are staying there. I confirmed with the resort myself that there are no exceptions to this even for weddings.\n\nTo access my brother/his fianc\u00e9e's block of rooms requires a stay of 5 days at minimum. Without their discount code the resort is even more expensive.", "I haven't spoken with anyone about this besides privately talking to one of my sisters one time.\n\nMy brother and his fianc\u00e9e notified everyone they invited of the change in resort and higher fees by email. There is a long email of replies with everyone talking about it and giving their opinion. I did read it but I didn't participate in it or reply publicly. I also addressed this with my brother privately and not on the email chain.", "The block of rooms is less expensive because of the discount code for the wedding. Without that the resort would be even more expensive than it already is.", "\u00a31500 per adult guest. I'm not sure of the amount for children and how much it is though.", "The new resort does not allow anyone inside or on the grounds unless they are staying there. It is for security reasons according to policy. There is no exceptions for weddings, I confirmed with the resort. \n\nTo book in my brother/his fianc\u00e9e's block of rooms you must stay at the resort for a minimum of 5 days. I also wouldn't stay at a different resort than everyone else even it were possible.", "It says you value the party more than your friends being there.", "They should realise that their gift from everyone, is their own attendance as it costs a bomb to go there! To expect gifts on top of that is out-of-this-world greedy.", "His words aren\u2019t matching his actions.\n\nThat can be hard to accept, as a sibling. But it is 100% the truth looking at this as it is being laid out. \n\nThis is how I\u2019d play it:\n(1) Really? That is a lot more expensive. Can everyone afford it? \u2014ONE convo calmly saying all that. And ending with \u201cOK, I\u2019ll see if I can swing it. I\u2019ll let you know\u201d\n\n(2) let him know you can\u2019t afford it. Simply, \u201clooked at my finances and I can\u2019t afford to spend anything additional on this. I hope you and x have a lovely wedding.\u201d Don\u2019t apologize, don\u2019t berate, don\u2019t do anything but a simple text saying no and don\u2019t engage in an argument thereafter. \n\n(3) if family comes for you, calmly reiterate above. \u201cI talked to him when he announced this, and I tried to make it work, but it\u2019s just not possible.\u201d Don\u2019t engage in arguments, don\u2019t blame.\n\n(4) use that money on a vacation you ACTUALLY want to take instead!!\n\nLook, they\u2019re getting married. They can do whatever tf they want. Ultimately it\u2019s their choice, you adjust yourself according to it.", "He is getting a big discount based on how many people will come to the resort paying full price. So yeah, it is important you attend so he can afford the more expensive resort. Since you are family, it is easier to guilt you into not missing \u201chis big day\u201d.", "While staying in villas in the Cancun area, I had massages and meals at all inclusives. They checked your name at the gate and then there were no problems entering.", "Weird, when I went to Cancun we went into town, rented a car and drove back roads to Tulum and Chichen Iza and did not notice anything off color"]}
