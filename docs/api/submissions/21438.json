Air Canada has canceled my flights 3 times in the last week. Finally they got me booked on a flight out. I paid the extra money each time I checked in to ensure I had a priority window seat (I get claustrophobic in the middle or aisle)\n\nSo I finally get to my seat. There\u2019s a couple flying together. Woman in the aisle has a broken leg and she\u2019s big. Real big. Guy with her is absolutely enormous and he\u2019s sitting in my window spot. Like so big there\u2019s absolutely no way he shouldn\u2019t be buying 2 seats. His legs are the size of my torso. \n\nSo I get to the spot and I say hey dude you\u2019re sitting in my seat. \n\nHe responds yeah it\u2019s cause she broke her leg. \n\nOkay? I\u2019m not sure what that has to do with you taking my seat. \n\nI look at the girl and she\u2019s got a small brace wrap on her ankle and that\u2019s it. \n\nSo we proceed to argue and a guy in the row ahead says to me why are you being a dick just sit in the middle \n\nI was like no. I paid for this seat. I\u2019m not wedging myself between you cause you can\u2019t be bothered to secure the seat(s) you need. I want the seat I paid for. It\u2019s not my problem you didn\u2019t prepare. They continue to ramble about it being the nice thing to do. I truly don\u2019t care. \n\nThe flight attendant then comes to me and asks if they can put the ladies crutches at my feet\u2026.. Never mind the obvious fact that we\u2019re in an exit row. I don\u2019t get how I can\u2019t have literally anything at my feet because it\u2019s a danger but then you want me to put a major tripping hazard literally wedged right into the emergency exit line to escape. Now that I think about it I don\u2019t understand how you put someone who may not be able to move because they have leg issues so they\u2019re slow and they\u2019re so big you can\u2019t pass through to the exit.  That alone feels like a hazard and she should\u2019ve been assigned to a diff row\u2026.\n\nI responded absolutely not. I\u2019m not sharing the space I paid for with somebodies crutches. Figure it out it\u2019s not my problem. I have had enough of being berated I\u2019m not doing any favours after this dialogue. \n\nEveryone gave me the stink eye including the flight attendant (who I feel should be neutral,  not berating me for wanting my assigned seat). \n\nThere were open seats in first. Why not bump the girl up? Or bump me up if they want to sit together. Either way\n\nShould I have given up my seat or was I in the right to sit where I paid?\n\nAITA or are these people the asses?", "created_utc": 1688582231, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14rjb8b/aita_for_sitting_in_the_preferred_seat_i_paid_for/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The absolute fucking entitlement of people to just assume they can take what someone else paid for. It\u2019s like me buying a cart of bargain food and then taking someone else\u2019s full of decent food and then being like - what\u2019s the problem?

We absolutely have to stop kowtowing to these idiots (flight attendants included). Every time someone gets away with this nonsense it just encourages others to do the same. \n\nI was flying out of YVR in a red eye one night. I booked my seat early. It was the spot where they only put 2 seats instead of three. \n\nI get there and a dude is in my window seat and his briefcase, notes, gone etc are already spread over the other seat. I tell him he\u2019s in my seat and he tells me there\u2019s lots of empty seats. (It was an undersold flight). I said \u201cGood, now pick up your stuff and get out of my fucking seat\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m not usually that much of an asshole but it\u2019s a 10PM flight arriving in YYZ at 6AM and I wanted to sleep. I knew the aisle seat was going to be unoccupied. \n\nWe can\u2019t let these people get away with that level of entitlement. \n\nNTA", "NTA, you paid extra for that seat.  The other issue is that to sit in an emergency exit row you have to be physically able to assist others, neither were. Then the flight attendant wanted to store the crutches under your seat.  It sounds like she was friends with them as there are so many broken rules.  Please file a complaint against her.  She was endangering the entire flight.", "NTA, you paid for it, end of story", "Absolutely NTA", "Definitely NTA", "NTA based on what you described. If you pay extra for your seat then you should get that seat and the attendant could have offered you a similar or better seat if she felt the other people needed some accommodation. Honestly, I'm not skinny myself but I would not want to sit wedged between rwo random strangers spilling into my already small seat (thanks airlines). If they were together then they can sit beside each other and share the smoosh.", "Nta. Regardless of their size, you paid for a certain seat. It's the airlines problem if they need to store something", "NTA - people who are obese need to be buying a second seat or be denied boarding.", "NTA\nThe entitlement and stupidity of those two and that guy interrupting is just overwhelming.", "No airline sits those with mobility issues (and who apparently preboarded?) in the emergency exit row. I call BS.", "NTA- \nI am a flight attendant. At any airline, people are not allowed to sit in emergency exit seats if they need any sort of assistance. This is for obvious reasons, if there's an emergency the people in that seat need to move as fast as possible and not block the exit. So, the husband could have sat there but not the wife. And you are correct, they can't block the exit row with crutches. You can at any other seat by the window. I'm guessing you were on a flight with newer flight attendants because this simply wouldn't happen if they knew what was happening. Unfortunately at pretty much every airline there's a huge turnover rate for flight attendants because we are underpaid and underrepresented.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
