His younger brother is straight. They are very close and his brother spends a lot of time at our house or we at his.\n\nWe've been together for 8 years but I've known them for longer. I always got along with his brother but for some time he's been acting weird.\n\nAt first I didn't really notice anything. A little over a year ago he started touching me more. Nothing inappropriate but almost every time he's close to me. \n\nIf I'm walking by he'd pull me to his side or he'd start playing with my hair. Lately he also started pulling me into his lap or coming up behind me and putting his arms around me. He also sometimes makes comments about how I look.\n\nI know that none of this is really a big deal or anything that could be called inappropriate but sometimes it makes me uncomfortable. I brought it up to my partner but he said he didn't notice anything and that I could just be overreacting.\n\nI thought he could be right because I'm close to finishing uni so I'm more stressed than usual. I had brushed it off until 2 days ago.\n\nMy laptop broke down while I was trying to finish an important paper and my partner had his at work with him. I asked his brother if I could borrow his laptop and he came by to drop it off.\n\nI finished the paper yesterday evening and downloaded it. I somehow messed up and accidently put it in some random folder. I had titled it \"[my name] [title of paper]\" so I typed my name in the search bar. My paper did show up but there was also another folder with my name on it.\n\nI know this will probably make me the asshole to a lot of people but I was curious so I opened it. It was filled with pictures. Most of them were pictures we took over the years with me and other people in it but a few of them made me feel sick.\n\nMost of the pictures were harmless but between the normal pictures there would be some of me sleeping or changing. Some were just me playing with my dog but taken from a strange angle that made it seem like someone was trying to take a picture without being noticed.\n\nI had to stop looking because my hands started shaking and I felt like I couldn't breathe.\n\nMy partner came home shortly after and I showed him what I found. I told him I don't want his brother around me anymore. I won't keep them from seeing each other but I didn't want to be there for it.\n\nHe looked at me like I'm insane. He tried to calm me down but wouldn't listen to what I said. He just kept repeating that I should stop being so childish and that none of what I was saying was a reason for me to not want him around. He said I shouldn't have found those pictures anyway and that I should know better than to snoop through other people's things. \n\nI didn't really know what else to say because he kept talking over me and trying to twist my words. I slept in the guest bedroom and haven't seen him before he went to work. He'll be home soon and I know he'll expect an apology for how I acted but I still feel sick thinking about it.\n\nDid I really overreact?\n\nEdit:\n\nWhen my partner came home we had another talk. I see now that I was making a big deal out of nothing. My partner explained that he knew about the pictures and had taken some of them himself. He tried to explain it to me yesterday but I was too hysteric to understand what he was saying. I'm sorry for wasting your time.", "created_utc": 1694806722, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16jmoq0/aita_for_not_wanting_to_be_around_my_partners/", "score": 97, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Dump that asshole", "NTA\n\nLittle brother is *not* straight and *is* creeping on you. If it were just the pictures, I'd have said something similar to someone else's comments: then since you were already snooping it would make sense to quickly see if he's got folders with pictures of other family members.\n\nBut there's playing with your hair, being all touchy-feely, complimenting your looks. No matter what sex and orientation, if I wasn't in a relationship with someone I wouldn't put my arms around them unless they were offering a hug, and I definitely wouldn't play with their hair.", "If someone is consistently making you feel uncomfortable and your partner is unsupportive, then it may be time to reevaluate your relationship or pursue counseling.", "You did not overreact.  If a woman saw that and her husband's brother had taken the pictures, the appropriate response would be to get livid.\n\nHe is touching you inappropriately and without consent.

And your partner is in deep denial.", "NTA\n\nTrust your gut, if someone is making you feel sick and uncomfortable then you know there's something wrong. Don't let anyone gaslight you into thinking you're overreacting. If your partner can't support your own feelings of safety then it may be time for a new partner. Little brother sounds like he's going through a creepy infatuation and needs to have a reality check. Either way, you should trust yourself when it comes to your safety alarm bells going off.", "NTA - this makes me SO VERY uncomfortable. The touching alone was bad enough, but jfc - a whole folder of pictures of just you, with images of you sleeping, and from angles where he was trying to hide taking a picture of you?! And your partner said it was nothing?! Just, ewww.\n\nI'd have a heart to heart with your partner about why this is so gross (it's stalking, btw) and how violated you feel. If he continues to dismiss you, it is time to reevaluate your relationship. Don't go anywhere near his brother ever again.\n\nEdit: if you do need to spend time around the brother, and he tries to get handsy, loudly and firmly tell him \"Please stop, that makes me uncomfortable.\" If you bring up the pictures at all, make sure to do so in a place with other people around, and consider taking screenshots of them as he may delete them and try to pretend he doesn't know what you're talking about.", "NTA. You need to either leave or have a family meeting with his brother. You are being made to feel uncomfortable.", "NTA and I don't think you owe him an apology. I'm sorry but it's weird, he likely has a crush on you which kinda sweet but having photos taken of you off guard without your knowledge is borderline stalker behaviour and that's not okay. You have every right to feel uncomfortable and not want to be around the brother!", "NTA. If you were a woman, I'd be telling you to run. Fuck sexism, I think you should leave unless BF reverses course. You deserve better.\n\nHis brother is a creep. Worse, your BF is deliberately disregarding your rights to your own body, and telling you that you have no right to control who, how, or when your body is photographed. Your body. Your choice.

It's not and whoever said it was is dead wrong. Your partner is blind and weirdly too okay with this going on between you and his brother \u2013 especially after expressing your discomfort.\n\nI can't believe your partner is dismissing you for having a problem with his brother's weird obsession.

And even if he\u2019s not, the excuses and lack of support for something like this is unacceptable behavior.", "NTA Every thing you mentioned is inappropriate. Sorry. Little brother is NOT straight. And your partner is not taking any of this seriously. You didn't snoop.\n\nYou owe no one an apology.  The brother needs to explain the pictures. \n\nI suggest you start packing.

Look, let\u2019s go back to before the computer situation and leave the photos and snooping out of the conversation.\n\nSomeone was touching you in a way that made you uncomfortable.\n\nThat right there is all the reason you need to stay away from someone. Period. I feel like they don\u2019t teach this to boys but they really should. Nobody gets to touch you without your consent.\n\nIdeally you would have told him to back off, but that\u2019s really hard, so you did the next best thing and took it to your partner. Your partner not only didn\u2019t believe you, he made you out to be the bad guy.\n\nThat\u2019s all the reason you need to dump him. Nobody handles these things perfectly, but he should at least have been to have a chat with his brother to say \u201cOP doesn\u2019t like all the touching, please back off a little.\u201d He couldn\u2019t even do that tiny thing for you.\n\nThe only thing that has changed since you found those photos? You have hard proof that your gut feeling was right, and your partner showed you that even that isn\u2019t enough for him to believe you.\n\nDon\u2019t let them talk you into letting this slide.

He used to do things like that all the time when I was younger so it's not really something unsual. I didn't even realize he'd started doing it again at first. It kind of feels different now but that could just be me being dramatic", "It's technically not my home though. My partner and his brother built it almost 20 years ago and since his brother moved out ut's my partner's house. I don't have the right to decide who is allowed in so I can't really do much if my partner wants his brother to come over", "I'm 26", "Technically it's not anything bad.

They're photos taken secretly and obviously OP did not and would not have consented to having these pictures taken. Their content is irrelevant", "The folder was inside another folder that was filled something unrelated.

Still, poisoned situation you are in, see that you do what is best for yourself, but your bf dismissing your justified feelings is a huge red flag!", "Yeah, it doesn't matter how many folders he's tucked it away in, if you do a search for your name (which you did under perfectly reasonable circumstances) it's going to bring it up", "If your BF can't see reason, you may need to move on. His brother is definitely more than casually interested in you. It may be obsessive, it may be dangerous.\n\nDo not ignore this, do not allow your BF to downplay this.\n\nGavin deBecker in Gift of Fear makes the point that you ignore that pit in your stomach, that feeling of creepiness, at your peril. That feeling is telling you something super important - it's your subconscious warning you of danger.", "Tbh the fact that OP is 26, has been dating his bf for 8 years and has lived with the bf and the brother before they started dating makes me think he's been manipulated into doubting himself. His bf seems like a gaslighter and the way OP tries to put the blame on himself is pretty worrying imo", "You are not being dramatic. Please don't let your boyfriend gaslighting work. You are being very reasonable, your boyfriend and his brother are being disgusting.\n\nThe intention behind the actions has very obviously changed considering the obsession that is beyond creepy.", "It might not be your house, but it\u2019s your home.

Maybe a bit dramatic, but I get it.  Seems apparent he has sexuality issues and doesn't know how to deal with them and he appears to have a crush on you.  His touching is uncalled for even with whatever it is he's dealing with.  Why your partner doesn't understand this entire set of issues is rather strange.  My imagination could get carried away, so I'll stop here.  I think you have a problem...with both of them.", "NTA he's being a total creep. Let's be honest if you were a woman everyone would be telling you to run for the hills sp I'll do it now. Your bf is protecting his brother and doesn't have your back.

And then we find a folder of photos that the man took of our daughter from strange angles when she wasn't noticing. What would you say? (Sometimes people \"get\" things better when it's their \"daughter\" in the story.)\n\nThen, I would tell him... You're lucky I'm not taking a restraining order out against your brother. I don't know why you aren't taking me seriously, but this isn't a joke. I don't want your brother around me ever again.", "I was going to say the same thing. You saved me lots of typing.

Don't be alone with him again. Ever. Best wishes.", "Your not overreacting & he is creeping. If you feel uncomfortable do not see the brother if your boyfriend doesn't understand that his brother is creeping you out, he isn't much of a boyfriend.", "I've known them since I was 10/11. They were pretty much the only people I could go to so I asked if I could live with them.\n\nI talked to my partner yesterday and it turns out the situation is different than what I thought.
