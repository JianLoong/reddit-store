{"id": 15787, "submission_id": "13076y1", "title": "AITA for refusing to feed my boyfriend's sons?", "selftext": "We don't live together for now (my choice due to space and finances and logistics). My boyfriend has 50/50 custody of his 2 sons (twins, 17). They are very nice kids (I've been with my boyfriend for 6 years and his sons are great).\n\nMy boyfriend can be really irresponsible with money sometimes. In September he went back to school for his Masters and in doing so had to give up a pretty lucrative job. He's been living off savings (which has now run out because he can't budget and he has an expensive lifestyle...ex, he doesn't cook or even make a sandwich so they eat only via DoorDash...$$$). He's been looking for another job he can do while he goes to school but he hasn't found one. For months I've asked him to please budget to conserve his money and to ask his sister for a loan and he keeps saying he will but hasn't.\n\nSince his savings ran out, he has borrowed a bit of money from his aunt (but certainly not enough) so I've been helping him reluctantly. I don't make that much money, and I always stick to a budget and this is really causing me stress.\n\nSo to the issue: I put some money on my credit card and told him he could use it to eat and to get to school, but that's all I have and to please be careful with it, and to figure out a plan B (his sister can loan him money...he just hasn't bothered to ask her).\n\nFor the past 6 weeks, on many occasions when his boys are staying with him (every other week) he has ordered them Door Dash. This triples how much it costs, and it's eating up the money very quickly. \n\nHis ex-wife (boy's mom) comes from money. A LOT of money. She lives in house worth several million, she has expensive cars. The boys each got a nice car for their 16th birthdays. They have a trust fund (worth $500,000 each) that will kick in when they are 25. They will also have their college completely paid for. Neither have a part-time job, so neither of them have a cent to their names for now.\n\nSo for the past 6 weeks I have been pleading with him to have the boys talk to their mom. To explain that while they stay with their dad, he has no money/job right now and he doesn't have a credit card, so they can't eat unless his poor broke girlfriend pays for it. And to ask (a) if they can use her credit card or (b) if she can give them a loan that they can use for food (even just to buy themselves groceries and cook something). Then I'll only have to pay for my boyfriend to eat, which is still really difficult for me. He claims they asked and she said nope.\n\nTheir mom is a nice person and usually pretty reasonable, so I find it bizarre that she'd actually say flat out no, so I suspect something is being lost in translation. I've asked my boyfriend to speak to her and he won't.\n\nSo this week I cancelled my card (requested a new one with a new number). And when my boyfriend needs something I will order it for him myself. But I have been refusing to buy the boys food.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682562375, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13076y1/aita_for_refusing_to_feed_my_boyfriends_sons/", "score": 776, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s completely reasonable for this nice woman to say no to giving any more money to this money pit of a man, and you should do the same. His priorities are a wreck. He\u2019s got two kids to support, yet he quit his job?! Ridiculous. And you\u2019re enabling him with every penny you give him. He\u2019s got a whole family of women giving him money - you, his ex, his sister. You all need to stop. It\u2019s time for him to grow up. Also, who is paying this guy\u2019s rent/mortgage? Please tell me it\u2019s not you.", "NTA, you were very generous giving him the credit card, and he took advantage of your kindness by spending frivolously. He can talk to his sons mother or family for money to feed the boys. Don't even buy him food. He's a grown ass man, smh.", "NTA. Partners don\u2019t have to live together. Even married ones. And even though you\u2019ve known the kids since they were 11, you are still not responsible for them. I do question why you are funding your boyfriend\u2019s poor choices though. He could learn to cook. He could get any old part time job to fund himself. He made the dumb choice to live on not enough savings. Stop helping him entirely. Because it seems like he relies entirely on others to get by.", "Why did you give your BF, who you know is bad at managing money, access? \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t pay for anything else. You have helped. Tell him you have no more money, and let him work it out. He\u2019s your BF, not your husband. To be truly honest, he sounds like he\u2019s not worth it to me, but that\u2019s your decision.", "NTA. The boys won't starve. Their mom won't let that happen. There might be some backlash on your bf for not providing for them,  but he's earned that backlash. Honestly, giving him your credit card and thinking for a moment that he would be more responsible with your money than he was with his own was the only thing you did wrong.

The biggest reason is it's not like you're not actually feeding them, you're just unable to afford to eat out for every meal. Which is a pretty normal situation to be in. You should stop providing the cash though. I think the line from \"supportive\" to \"enabling\" has been crossed.", "NTA \u2013 There has got to be word more forceful that simply \"frustrating\" that we can use when we have to watch people we care about spend money frivolously.  It sucks, but there is nothing much we can do about it.  You did the one thing you can do, which is to withdraw funding of your boyfriend's very silly spending habits.  When he is ready (or just hungry enough) hopefully he will be open to learning about budgeting, meal planning, and all of those other skills that he should have learned a very long time ago.", "NTA. But stop giving him money. It's not your responsibility.", "NTA\n\nNot your kids, not your problem. Your bf is irresponsible with money, stop giving it to him!", "NTA The kids are 17, not 7.

Have you always coddled him this much? Tell him to figure his shit out", "NTA. I think if you had continued to do what you had been doing, you would have moved from helping out to enabling his bad habits. It\u2019s not like your BF has been trying but still finds himself in a bad situation - he just isn\u2019t trying to fix his situation. And, if you continue to help him, he is going to keep relying on you until he drains you dry.", "NTA - I think you have been patient and supportive during this transitional period in his life but he's really not making it easy on you.\n\nI'm sure many people will say you should be done with him and you likely will just gloss over those comments because it's not even an option in your mind, but I do think there are some very troubling things here.\n\nI, personally, would be out because this isn't some temporary lapse of judgement. Imagine if I told you that my girlfriend went out and bought a motorcycle earlier today with our joint account funds but didn't discuss it at all with me, what would you say to me? That's a breach of trust. It shows no commitment to our future. And it's concerningly impulsive. \n\nI hate to say it, but what your boyfriend is doing is worse on every level. Good luck OP.", "NTA, this is a huge red flag in the relationship.  He is using you big time.  There are tons of simple jobs out there for him to work while he is in school.  It might not be in his career path, but it is a paycheck.  Most likely he will never pay you back.  Next will be he will not be able to pay his rent or house payment and will want to move in.  Take a good hard look at the relationship.  Where is this going.  He may be qualified for a good job, but will he have the admission to get one or just keep leeching off of you and other family members.", "NTA for not feeding his kids, but Y T A to yourself for dating a bum.", "NTA but your bf is a loser", "YWBTA If you keep this up. This guy is playing and even though you don't mean to, you are making the situation worse for the boys, and yourself. Gently, you need to stop. Your beau has 4 women supporting his idiocy. You have to stop, before you are bankrupt, hungry, and evicted. It's always hard to admit a con man had taken you, but clearly he has. All you are doing at this point is supporting Door Dash.  I'm so sorry to be blunt, but sugar coating it does a disservice to you.  Yes, he will probably just find another woman to rip off, but at least you will be able to for yourself from this mess with your eyes open. Take care.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
