OP is allowed to say no, you can't call my child that and no, I am not indulging your name obsession or your ploys to try to hurt MIL.\n\nOP is also allowed to reduce or cut contact if GMIL does not respect the rules around OP's child that OP, as the parent, is allowed to set.\n\nGMIL being old doesn't give her a pass to break rules or to do whatever she wants.\n\nOld ladies thinking they can do what they like despite what they are told is how we got the coconut allergy story that resulted in a poor innocent child dying.\n\nIgnoring bad behaviour when it is smaller allows for escalation and worse behaviour later.", "Yuuuup. My Nanny was on hospice care due to a heart issue abd ended up with a UTI that really made her seem out of her mind - and at 84 she was always sharp as a tack, even while on hospice until that week she got it. It really messes with them and can do a lot of harm (sadly this did take a lot out of her and she passes within a few days\ud83d\ude14).", "Also, it's not just UTIs.  Any infection that gets combined with dehydration causes delirium.  UTIs are commonly associated with the phenomenon because people drink less because it hurts to pee.  My husband took me to the ER because he thought I was having a stroke because my mental status suddenly changed. I didn't even know what day of the week it was.  It turned out that I was severely dehydrated and had a kidney infection.  I just didn't notice because I had Fibromyalgia and didn't pay attention to any new pains.  I thought I was fine.  It took me a little while to trust my brain again."]}
