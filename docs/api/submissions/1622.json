People can be really hesitant to draw boundaries with elderly people because they're set in their ways, they're sometimes lonely, they're closer to death, and lots of cultures emphasize being very deferential to your elders. But they can still be abusive to children. As much as she's vulnerable, your baby is more vulnerable.

Best to stop that nonsense now before it gets to the point where she\u2019s pushing you out and inserting herself as your daughter\u2019s mother.

Both Grandparent in laws sound like they are controlling.", "As soon as she said *I can finally have my little Gigi*, I would have shut it down.
