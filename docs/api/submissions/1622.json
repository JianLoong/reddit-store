Appearances are evryrhinf, don't you know. Any slight deviation from what she deemed \"perfect\" came with reprecussions. As an example; I was required to have a minimum of a 3.5 GPA. The ONE time my GPA was a 3.495 resulted in being screamed at an berated for an hour. And I mean purple faced, spittle flying screaming. I was always (except math) in advanced classes, on the Honor Roll, in National Honor Society and did a TON of extracurricular activities. Didn't date, church minimum of 3x per week. My mother still threatened to slap me on the regular.\n\nSo, I don't want ANYTHING from my mother. I strive to have as little to do with her as possible. Text at most once a month (she initiates). Phone call every couple of months. Again she's the one who calls. The entire conversation is me saying \"Uh huh, nope, yes, not really, ok and fine\". \n\nMy limit for being in her presence is approximately a week. Though day 3 is the limit of cordialiy; my brothers even joke about it. I don't want her hugging me or touching me or even being too close in proximity to me. I don't open up or share with her because if I do, she is likely to use it as a weapon. Though I'm sure if she were asked, she would say we have a great relationship and are friends.\n\nI have no issue hugging my father or other family members. Or opening up.
