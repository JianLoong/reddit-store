The problem is the desire for a perfect do-over child.  And, even more, the expectation that this child will be \"perfect\" which is an insane expectation for any human being, let alone an infant with a lot of growing and learning to do.  \n\nIf she wants the nickname, but gives up the expectations, you don't have a problem.  If you force her to give up the nickname, but she still expects the child to be her perfect do-over descendant, you have major problems. \n\nYou need to address the root of the problem, the desire for a perfect do-over child.

People can be really hesitant to draw boundaries with elderly people because they're set in their ways, they're sometimes lonely, they're closer to death, and lots of cultures emphasize being very deferential to your elders. But they can still be abusive to children. As much as she's vulnerable, your baby is more vulnerable. You might have a one-to-one conversation with MIL sometime about her relationship with GMIL and the Gigi thing and see if you can find out what she was l ike to grow up with.", "NTA\nIts your child, you get to decide what she is called and what not (as long as she cant decide for herself).\n\nAnd its definitly not your GMIL\u2019s child, she has to respect your and your husbands wishes.", "NTA \n\nGMIL has got some issues she needs to work out. Your baby isn\u2019t her baby, and you\u2019re not selfish for not wanting her to treat your baby as so.", "NTA. Don't forget that GMIL raised MIL and there's a reason deep in that mess somewhere that their relationship is so screwed up. A child is not a pawn or tinker toy to be used in this little game GMIL and MIL play and they should never have the job of being an adults pacifier or Prozac. Good on you for protecting your baby from that shit.", "NTA - Like someone else above said, it\u2019s not the nickname, it\u2019s the obsessiveness of it all. It definitely is kinda creepy that she clearly thinks of this baby as her own new daughter. I would\u2019ve just been a little more tactful about telling her she\u2019s being weird though haha.  (Also the only argument they had back was to \u201crespect your elders???)", "NTA and congrats on standing up for yourself and your MIL.", "NTA. Best to stop that nonsense now before it gets to the point where she\u2019s pushing you out and inserting herself as your daughter\u2019s mother. GIL can be a fantastic grandmother without making a point about her daughter not being her ideal child. Both Grandparent in laws sound like they are controlling.", "As soon as she said *I can finally have my little Gigi*, I would have shut it down. GMIL sounds weirdly controlling and possessive over giving a girl this nickname. \n\nNTA. Tbh I'd keep my distance. Whatever GMIL has in mind for her version of 'perfect' has resulted in her cold and distant relationship with MIL.

Also as a prop to make passive aggressive comments about her own daughter. \n\nIf she can\u2019t separate the two then no she shouldn\u2019t use the nickname."]}
