They all have multiple children. None of them went to college, and they all work lower paying entry level jobs. I graduated last year (I started college in highschool) and I work as a nurse.

My husband and I own a 4 bed 2 bath home. I told them no because they have a habit of settling in somewhere and not paying rent and refusing to leave. They also let their four kids absolutely destroy every rental they live in, coloring on the walls, holes in the walls, etc. \n\nMy brother and his girlfriend are pissed at me, and they blew up at us at my mothers birthday party last week.

He also notes that, often, people living in poverty or those being evicted only ask for help from their families and friends in the most dire of circumstances, specifically because of the judgment that often comes with the request. So do what you want to do, but don't necessarily ask for absolution or a NTA judgment here. In the US, we're stuck in a system that encourages the exploitation of those with the fewest resources.

That means first saving, then investing.  Every dollar you give him today because \"you can afford it\" (according to them) is like 5-10x that when you think about retiring.

It also sounds like you look down on them for not having multiple kids without a college education, like they shouldn't have kids if they can't afford it. Life's not that black and white.There are many ways you could help out your brother besides having them live in your home (especially given the amount of money you and your husband earn), but you haven't mentioned any of them, you seem perfectly happy to wipe your hands clean and allow your brother and niece's/nephew's to be homeless.\n\nYour brother is a dick for acting the way he did at the party and assuming that you would save the day without having had a real discussion with you about their circumstances and situation. Its unreasonable to demand your support out of the blue and then act like a dick when you don't like the answer you get (even if it's a shitty answer, like yours).\n\nEvery story has two sides, but yours sounds exceptionally one sided and I am sure a very different story would be told by your brother, even if he was being a real jerk about it all.

So, very justifiable AH.  \n\n\nYour loser siblings are def AH (as you describe them), asking you to take in 6 people, including 4 out-of-control, destructive children really is too much to ask.

Setting boundaries is important, but giving to our loved ones without reward should be a human facet. Qualifier - If you feel like they\u2019re terrible or a strain, then there\u2019s no obligation.

Especially if you put conditions on it that you'll stop paying any assistance on the rent if they're not employed and contributing within a certain amount of time.  **You are in the top 10 Percent of incomes in the United States.

But many, many people work hard and make sound choices for themselves, and don't have things work out due to factors outside of their control-- or even in their control, that shouldn't influence things.

That is a type of help that does not stop the problem.  Offering to *sterilize your siblings (*Tubali litigation *is* advised by doctors as a PERMANENT sterilization, despite the fact it can *sometimes* be safely undo.

Ignoring how I lowkey consider sterilization incredibly offensive to ask (You could just... insist your help requires them not being pregnant and informing them how to get free condoms and such),1.5k is **Less than 1% of your household income.**  \n\nAs someone who's been personally trying to help my mother out of poverty and homelessness (which is not her fault, and I only make roughly 55k a year), I've watched my wealthier family members regularly try to give her \"Help\" consisting of 200, 400 dollar sums here and there when things are very bad, but ultimately that's using a spade to help someone out of a deep hole, and considering *Life* is the accumulation of more debts, If a week at the red roof in is actually helpful for your sibling I'll eat my fuckin hat.  \n\nPlease do research not with the hordes of folks on reddit, but with actual people in your community dealing with poverty on a regular basis and get their opinion.
