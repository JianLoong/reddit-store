They all have multiple children. None of them went to college, and they all work lower paying entry level jobs. I graduated last year (I started college in highschool) and I work as a nurse. My husband works on planes but I don\u2019t want to say what he does specifically. Our household income is about 200k, and average where we live is about 80k I think. This is all relevant. \n\nMy parents like to host big family functions for every holiday and they bring the whole family together.
