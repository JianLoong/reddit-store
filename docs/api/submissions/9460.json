Now 2 years later I have a great job in a neighboring city about an hour away and am thinking about moving there, so I can be closer to work and I can afford a nicer house. I talked to family and friends about it. My mom said she would have never helped me if she thought I was going to move out of the house. My aunt, who somehow found out, said she would have fought harder for the house, if she had know. Apparently everyone thought I was just going to live in that house for the rest of my life.

The house is an asset that was left to you to do as you please.  It is absurd for anybody in your family to assume that you would live in the house for life.

The aunt owes the mom her inheritance back, not OP.", "None of that honors the grandparents, who gave it to OP for a reason.", "I could definitely see that. My mom can be a controlling person at times. As for my aunt, she won't talk to anyone near me or my mom. She definitely has some regrets are that. That's also why I said she found out somehow. That was the first time I heard from her since the funeral.", "Alright I'm going to give little more detail, because I'm curious if this changes anything. First my grandparents didn't have any nursing home insurance and if not for me. They would have had to go and the nursing home would have gotten the house. Second this \"family home\" isn't some old house build by great, great, grandpa or even on the family farm land. It's a house my grandparents bought new in the 60s near the city they both worked and lived in.", "Your aunt had no legal right to blackmail your mom into paying her to shut up. She had no legal claim to your inheritance. Your aunt owes your mom back because she coerced that money out if her - you don't. Your mom should be directing her anger and demands at your aunt.

I guess I should have said if you don\u2019t give them a chance you\u2019d be TA instead of the way I said it. My grandpa built the family house in 1965. My mom and her 9 siblings grew up there and so did my siblings and I.

It might pay mortgage costs on a new home", "NTA it\u2019s Your property, you can do what you want with it.\n\nAnd I bet your grandparents would have been happy for you to use it to start a new life to make you happy no matter where.", "Nta", "Your grandparents left you the house.\n\nEnd of story.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your grandparents gave it to you without any regulatory stipulations. So they wanted you to use it the way that is best for you. If at this point selling it is best for you, then that's what you should do. I don't know why you evil aunt thinks she has any saying in it.

Sell the house to your aunt, appraised value plus your mom's inheritance.", "NTA  1. There was a will and aunt would have lost that suit.  2. Mom didn't need to give aunt a dime based on 1.   3.

That's between the mother and the aunt.", "I wouldn\u2019t call it fair, as OP has done absolutely nothing wrong, and any solution that doesn\u2019t involve the aunt paying something back is patently unfair.\n\nOP\u2019s mom made a bad decision, OP taking the lumps for it now certainly isn\u2019t fair but yeah, it\u2019s better for OP\u2019s mom. That I agree with.", "Maybe I've been looking into it. The problems are 1 I don't really want the hassle of a rental property and 2 I don't know if it will actually help. You could only imagine the backlash I would get if I got a crappy renter, probably worse than if I sold it plus now I got to pay to fix it up after.", "There are companies who will manage the rental.  You would not get the full rental payment but you would not have the hassle.", "Legally there was no coercion. There was no threat or anything that aunt could do in order to force OP's mom to hand the money over. OP's mom gave aunt part of the inheritance freely in order to shut her up. If she tried to sue to get it back, she would likely lose.\n\nI'm not saying that OP should start paying out of their own pocket. I'm saying there was no blackmail or coercion.

Extortion? Whatever, it's not legal and doesn't create a legal or moral right to the money. The mom was a sucker -- not OP's problem.", "Buy it through your realtor and at market price.", "NTA sell the house. Do not let yourself be guilted into sharing the proceeds. Its your money to do what you wish. Your mother decided to give your aunt money that's on her not you", "INFO. Does your Mom or Aunt want to live there or just horde it?", "NTA. Tell you aunt she's a thief and a horrible sister for taking advantage of your mom like that. Tell your mom it was dumb to give her sister all her Inheritance, and you can't make up for her childish decision. Then sell the home and go NC with the aunt.", "NTA\n\nSell the house. Reimburse your mom, sorry she isn't seeing reason. Especially if you feel your grandparents would understand. Or there is the option of renting it out. There are many good management companies. Best of both worlds for some people.

Do this!!", "Do not do this, OP. Don\u2019t rent something you are emotionally connected to. My friend did this because they had purchased the family grandparent house, and no one was ready to see it leave the family. No renter will appreciate it and treat it the way you would, and you will just be delaying the inevitable\u2014with work to get it into condition to sell after a rental.", "NTA", "Nta. Stop asking permission to sell it. It's yours. Not their's. It's yours! Do what you want.", "YTA for letting your mom give up her portion of the inheritance. Jesus.

It\u2019s your inheritance. Your mother\u2019s choice was independent of you. Sure, she did it thinking she was helping. But it was her choice to do that. She did not have to. Both of them could have been more helpful to their parents but apparently chose not to be. Your grandparents chose you to be their beneficiary and that was their choice. I think they would be very happy about your plan, and knowing they could give you a leg up. It is very archaic thinking that a \u201cfamily home\u201d is something you must hang on to if it isn\u2019t serving your life. More likely the reactions you are facing is more of the feeling that they have lost out on an inheritance again. Sell it and move on.", "You do NOT offer to sell it at a discount. You can have it appraised at market price and give them the opportunity to either pay that price or match the best final offer. You don\u2019t give a discount.", "And you know what, even if you said you wanted to live there forever as recently as last week, you are allowed to change your mind! Life changes, plans change, desire change, things happen. It's all part of life! Your life, your home, your choice.\n\nIf your mother or aunt want the home so badly, they're free to PURCHASE it from you.", "No. It would not be fair to pay your mom back. Your mom should NOT have paid your aunt and that money should come out of your aunt\u2019s double share and not your mom\u2019s.\n\nI agree it would have been better to offer to sell the house to your mom if you had any reason to suspect she\u2019d care about the house. However, you have no obligation to do so, it\u2019s your house and your grandparents gave it to you for the benefit of your financial future.", ">Like I said, people act nuts over inheritance\n\nIt is crazy what people do. I have a family friend who has not spoken to his sister in 37 years at this point over a disagreement over their mother's will. THIRTY SEVEN YEARS. They will likely die before they speak to each other again (they're both in their 70's now).\n\nThe kicker is each of them are very wealthy in their own right - our friend is a successful trial lawyer, his sister married a doctor who owned a large medical practice. Their mother's money ultimately was inconsequential to either of them, yet they let it DESTROY their relationship.\n\nI cannot even being to understand it.", "100% agree - it is best if you just sell and walk away from all of it. It'll be so much easier mentally and emotionally."]}
