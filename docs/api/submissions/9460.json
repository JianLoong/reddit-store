Skip forward when I graduated, I moved out of my parents and in with my grandparents at first it was just to find a job and apartment, but then their health started to fail so I decided to take care of them. About 6 years later, both have passed and it turns out they left me the house as a thank you. My mom was happy for me, she admitted she hated to lose the biggest part of her inheritance, but was overall happy for me. My aunt however went scorched Earth, she even tried suing me claiming I must have manipulated them, to make I long story short my mom ended giving the rest of her inheritance to my aunt in agreement that she can't sue me. Now 2 years later I have a great job in a neighboring city about an hour away and am thinking about moving there, so I can be closer to work and I can afford a nicer house. I talked to family and friends about it. My mom said she would have never helped me if she thought I was going to move out of the house. My aunt, who somehow found out, said she would have fought harder for the house, if she had know. Apparently everyone thought I was just going to live in that house for the rest of my life. Some are saying, it's your life and house and good for you for wanting to improve, some are saying just continue the commute, others are saying I am horrible for even thinking about sell a \"family home\". \nSo reddit Aita?", "created_utc": 1675871436, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10x1oe4/aita_for_selling_my_house_and_moving/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or, upon selling the home, pay your mother back the inheritance she gave up to fend off your aunt. That would be fair.", "NTA. The house is yours now, and, apparently, there are no conditions set to your inheritance. You need to do what you need to do to live your life. You did a good thing taking care of your grandparents in their later years, and they left the house to you, not to anyone else, for it.

Of course that's entierely up to you.", "NTA.\n\nThat house is now your property and the fact that it used to be a \"family home\" no longer matters.\n\nYour aunt is an entitled AH that you need to cut off your life asap.", "Sell and move on with YOUR life! That house is YOURS. Your Grandparents willed it to you for you to do what you want. Do NOT give in to these ridiculous expectations of your mother or aunt. Take the profit and invest it.

It is not like you said you\u2019d live there forever.\n\nIf they want to keep the house in the family, they can buy it from you.

Tell your family if they want the house, they can buy it from you at market value. It's a house, not your grandparents.", "I really wish your mother hadn't paid off the idiot child who didn't even help her own parents (your aunt). I have given in on a small amount *twice* (man, does death make greedy people more so!) just to be rid of those people...but your mother gave her entire share to her greedy sister, when her \"lawsuit\" would have gone nowhere. And I'd bet my dog your aunt didn't want the faaaamily home if it had been willed to your mother and her.

It doesn't matter how hard she would have fought for it, as it would have never become hers.

Your grandparents left you the house, not your mother or your aunt. If you want to sell it, that\u2019s your prerogative, not anyone else\u2019s.

Good on you for moving up in the world. Is there any way you could sell the house to a family member?", "NTA \n\nis $100k really the value of the home? sell it back to the fam then so u can move on. \n\nthe monthly payment even with todays high rates shouldn\u2019t even be a big deal esp if they split it all up. \n\nthats super awesome of you to help out your grandparents. and thats great they left you their home and i\u2019m sure they would want whats best for you.", "NTA.  The house is an asset that was left to you to do as you please.  It is absurd for anybody in your family to assume that you would live in the house for life.

Just remember: \"No\" is a complete sentence.", "NTA your mom definitely deserves it  instead of your mean aunt", "I agree, was already going to do that.", "I was thinking about seeing if anyone would want the house for a discount, and I would like to add my mom did help with Doctor appointment, when I was unable to take them.", "To be fair, I did say I wanted to live there forever when I was younger and didn't full understand what that meant.

I agree my aunt lives 4 states away, so she probably just wanted the money. The thing is her husband told me one time while we were talking that them together make over 400k and yet she was still willing to burn everything down over half a 100k house.", "That's what it's appraised that, honestly on the market in my area, I could probably sell it for 150k, but I would only charge them what was appraised. For my mom appraised minus what she gave to my aunt.", "Good on you.", "Does helping with a few appointments compare with the time you spent helping them in their last years ?", "If you want to sell it to them give them fair market price.  Don't screw them but also don't screw yourself.
