The problem is your son might be developing an eating disorder and/anorexia athletica. They both have the same effect--they're dysfunctional ways of viewing his body & can harm him through unhealthy eating/excessive exercise. Therefore, the solution is to help him learn how to eat healthfully.\n2. Removing his door has ZERO to do with eating and exercising healthfully. Instead, it says to him, \"You are so incapable of regulating yourself and I distrust you so much, that I have to treat you like a literal baby and monitor you 24/7. Also, at 16, you'll have no privacy, you can't even masturbate in peace.\"\n3. On both a short and long term level, you're harming, not helping him. Your parents are right here. I don't want to be too harsh because you're reaching for help & it's always hard to know what to do. But if he has an eating disorder or an exercise disorder he needs to learn how not to. He's 16, not 6. In two years, he'll be out of the house, and no one will be removing his door to peer in on him. He needs to learn this himself. Your job is to facilitate and encourage him.\n4. Consult an eating disorder expert and/or an exercise disorder expert who specializes in males. Male eating/exercising disorders are not uncommon but are often ignored by the medical establishment (source: my own son who had an eating disorder).", "You\u2019re coming from a decent place and I can tell you care. But I really think you are doing a lot more harm than good. I saw your comments saying he is in therapy. That is good! I get your worries about overworking and over exercising but lemme tell ya, removing privacy and creating extra strict environments will not help him. It will make him more sneaky. Trust me. I went through it. If he is not already with a specialist doctor that focuses on male eating and exercise disorders, that is your next step after putting the door back and apologizing. \nHonestly, have a heart to heart with him, apologize for removing the door, express your worry and concern for him, offer to be a listener. And keep him in therapy and take him to the specialist. \nThat all being said, your actions with removing the door are going to be perceived as AH behavior and so soft YTA.", "YTA removing doors does not constitute good parenting. This is such a bad take that I really hope this is bait.", "YTA, you'll achieve nothing but damage your child like this. \n\nFind your son a certified fitness trainer who is experienced in body positivity and has the relevant training knowledge for the kind of working out your son is into, and can structure a proper meal plan for his program. The deal is, he follows the entire program, meals included.", "YTA. Taking away his privacy isn't going to cure his eating disorder. He needs therapy.", "Gently, YTA. Your kid is harming himself, and you want to protect him, but this is the wrong way to go about it. Eating disorders in teens are very often about control. Teenagers' lives are out of their control - they have no say in where they live, when they sleep, how they spend their days. Your son is desperately trying to control one thing: his own body. He's doing it in a really unhealthy and destructive way, and that needs to be addressed, but taking away his privacy like this is only going to make him feel more out of control, and will certainly lead to more destructive and more secretive behaviour.\n\nYou need to go back to the doctor and get a referral to a specialist in eating disorders.", "YTA.\n\nGive him his door back.   \n\n\nObviously he needs help to stop exercising so much and harming his body, but congratulations, you've just become part of the problem.", "YTA. This is one of the worst things you could've done. He is going through something very difficult and you took away a physical reminder of his privacy. Please tell me that he is in therapy.", "YTA\n\nI'm sorry to say, your parents are right about this one. Taking away his door will do more damage than good. He's currently in his teens, this is the prime age when you begin to transition into adulthood and for teens, that usually starts with wanting to have a space you can call your own. You just took away that space and that sense of privacy. \n\nI truly empathise with you wanting to help your son, but taking away his door sends the wrong message. From your son's perspective, your actions are saying, \"I do not respect your boundaries, I do not respect your right to privacy.\" It will just encourage him to hide his eating and excercising habits from you (and likely other things in the future too).\n\nI wish I had a solution for you, it does sound like he has serious body issues and possibly an eating disorder. These require professional help beyond my expertise. All I can say is, while your heart was in the right place, this wasn't the way to go.", "YTA.\n\nTaking a door off a persons room and removing their anonymity and privacy is so invasive. You are asking to cause permanent damage to your relationship with your son", "YTA yeah pushing him away will help this situation won't it, how about actually talking instead of punishing him, because let me be clear removing his privacy is a punishment and also maybe get him talking to a therapist, you acknowledging he might have an eating disorder does nothing to actually help solve the eating disorder", "YTA part of his problem is control. When it feels like the world is out of his control, stressing him out and putting pressures on him to look good, the only things he CAN control is how much he eats and exercises. \n(At least that's what it feels like to him)\n\nThe lesson you just taught him: Nope. I am taking control over you. \n\nThat's not gonna help. You need to get him to a place where he can stop doing those things on his own.\n\nFind out what stresses him out in life/at school. Get him some massage appointments. It's been proven that getting massages has a positive effect on anorexic people, because massages feel good and  they get to experience their body in a positive way.\n\nAre there some support groups for parents you could join?", "YTA\n\nNot an okay way to deal with an eating disorder.", "YTA - I doubt this is real, but removing his door is not helping.", "YTA\n\nYou are doing more damage than good because you are taking away his privacy for anything he wants to do (even if that means just being alone in the quiet). if you care about him, you need to get him in therapy because taking away the door won't stop him from working out, he's just going to stop being home as much so he can work out other places", "Yes, YTA\n\nIts abusive to remove a door for privacy. And he's 16, you just proved to him not to trust or contact you when he moves out.", "YTA. Give him his door back.\n\nTalk with him about his health, your concerns, and what the doctor has said. If that doesn't work, consider enrolling him in therapy. Punishments like taking away his privacy are not going to make him understand that you care about his health.", "Does taking the door solve the problem? No? Of course it didn't.\n\nYTA", "Gentle YTA. I get what you are trying to do and you want to monitor him but he is entitled to privacy. He will resent you if you don\u2019t put the door back on. I had a friend\u2019s husband do this to his step-daughter for slamming the door and she moved out of the house and half way across the country. My friend did not defend her daughter and their relationship has been very rocky to the point where there were many months they didn\u2019t speak and the daughter wouldn\u2019t even speak to us friends or her other relatives. Increase therapy or have him see a psychiatrist that can educate him on how he is harming himself.", "I understand your fear, but I would find a disordered eating/exercising clinic for your son. YTA, because the punishment didn\u2019t suit the cause (also, it\u2019s just really not ok to do that ever.) But call your doctor and ask for recommendations for treatment. Apologize to your son, and tell him you are scared and don\u2019t want to lose him, but you did react badly and don\u2019t want to ruin your relationship with him. Put the door back, pursue therapies.", "YTA - My parents did this shit to me and it is incredibly damaging and fucked up.", "YTA - taking away your son's privacy is not the answer. If he has an eating disorder, he needs treatment. You're being awful.", "This above reddit pay grade.\n\nAny other circumstance I'd say Y T A, but your son is suffering from a ED and needs to be monitored. \n\nThis is really question for your doctor and phycologist for his ED.", "YTA. Is this bait? Or are people really this dense? Growing teenage boy with raging hormones, lemme take his bedroom door off. You also want to supervise any masturbation too right? And him changing? For health reasons of course. \n\nControl freaks love to take off doors to bedrooms. Give him back his door.", "YTA. why do parents always think that denying their teenagers privacy like this is going to help them with things like this?? your kid needs therapy, not punishment. there\u2019s something deeper at play, here.", "YTA. If you have the money I would suggest you to find a personal trainer to help him with training and eating but taking his door and privacy away is not it", "YTA. This isn't gonna solve the problem in the slightest. If anything it's gonna undermine your relationship with him because you're invading his privacy, so why should he trust you going forward?", "Yeah, YTA.

As someone who struggled with an ED including through high school, this isn\u2019t going to make anything better, and the complete lack of privacy is only going to make his mental health worse. You said he\u2019s in therapy - did you speak to his therapist about this before you did it? I\u2019m going to assume you likely didn\u2019t because I doubt a competent mental health professional would suggest this. \n\nIf his health is so jeopardised by his working out he needs to be in inpatient care, not at home without a door.", "Should you have done it no \n\nShould you put it back on yes\n\nLook I get it why you did that, my best friend was your son when we was about that age.\n\nHer dad trying to get through to her what the dr said was hard work.\n\nBut they worked on talking and being honest.

But people struggling with eating disorders / unhealthy relationships with exercise often develop these issues out a sense of a lack of control in the rest of their life, so they control what they can: their food and their bodies. But by taking away his door, you\u2019re reinforcing that lack of control and making him feel like you don\u2019t trust him/want to punish him for his illness and just generally disrespected. All of these feelings could very well make his disorder WORSE instead of better, which I know isn\u2019t what you want.\n\nAgain: I get that you\u2019re concerned for your son\u2019s health and safety. And I empathize. I\u2019m not saying that there is no need for intervention, but removing his door will only serve to drive him further away from you.

The past few months I have noticed that he started to eat less and workout more he obsessively stands too. I was worried that it was becoming disordered. We went to the doctor last week. He did lose a lot of weight. The doctor instructed us to stop the exercising so his body can heal. He is convinced nothing is wrong with him though.

It is better to get him into therapy where he can retrain thought patterns or otherwise learn whatever strategies he needs to deal with his problems.", "YTA. This is such a bad idea on so many levels", "YTA, but I say it as kindly as possible. I know that you mean well and that you are just trying to help. From your comments though, I think that you have figured that out. There are some really good suggestions in this thread. Your son has a tough road ahead of him, but don't give up", "YTA.

Unless you specifically want to watch your teenager masturbate, put back the damn door.", "I\u2019ve worked with kids like your son after it\u2019s gone so extreme they\u2019ve ended up hospitalized. These kids were monitored 24/7 to prevent from exercising, they needed to gain weight in order to get better and in the most extreme cases would be denied even going for walks. Some would eat, some would refuse. For some kids, as young as 11, their condition (psychologically and somatically) was so severe they had to be force fed via tube.\n\nMost of the kids absolutely despised their parents for wanting to help. They would sneak in exercise at any given moment\u2014 one kid, 12yo M would refuse to sit as he was convinced he\u2019d burn more calories standing. He\u2019d stand all damn day except for during meals. Meals which he\u2019d somertimes eat, sometimes throw against the wall. \n\nNow, the EAD is a symptom, and a very dangerous one, especially as your son is still developing, I would want to beat this ASAP because I\u2019ve seen what happens to kids and teens when it goes too far. Some missed school for months at the time, we had an 11yo boy with a psychiatrist mother who refused to let his parents help. Her background didn\u2019t help at all.\n\nThe parents were welcome to stay with their kids. The kid would always have one of us as their \u2018person for the day\u2019 and we\u2019d do all the necessary check ups, like weighing and appointments, and we\u2019d enter the daily struggle of food. Many were on such a high calorie intake they had to eat up to 6 times a day. \n\nIt\u2019s really difficult to kick an EAD as a teen, even with professional help. You are right to want to remove his door, but he\u2019ll likely sneak in exersising when you\u2019re not looking. Please watch out for further distortion in his eating habits, such as freaking out when he gets a high-calorie meal and so on.\n\nAn EAD is a symptom. A dangerous symtom. I hope it doesn\u2019t go as far for your son as I\u2019ve seen with the teens from work.

His attitude is nothing new and should be expected with a 16 year old. Of course he doesn\u2019t think anything is wrong with him, teens always think their invisible. It\u2019s a little concerning that you pretty much immediately went for the option of removing door number one. What lesson do you think he\u2019s going to learn here?

That\u2019s really thin. Admittedly, I have a slanted perspective since I\u2019m 6\u20192\u201d and was about 205ish at his age. If he is exercising that much, he NEEDS to up his calorie intake.

If anything it\u2019s taking even more control from him. That can backfire spectacularly with disordered eating.

Therapy is great, but it's not enough. Imagine his brain is a maze, right now it's leading him into harmful places and he needs to destroy it so he can build new paths. The building new paths is the hardest part, and you can destroy the walls over and over and over again, but with the same tools, the maze is going to be exactly the same. \n\nHe needs new tools, and you can help provide them.", "You're welcome, and for what it's worth from an internet stranger, I'm genuinely sorry you're having to go through this.
