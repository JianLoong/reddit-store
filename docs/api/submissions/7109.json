If you\u2019re not comfortable talking about something then you absolutely don\u2019t have to. \n\nBut I strongly suggest we all need to stop stigmatizing such a natural bodily function. If a male wants to learn more about it, I\u2019m all for it. Especially if that guy either is a dad for a girl or you can see him being that dad down the road. Unless you\u2019re getting attempted mansplaining vibes, the more it\u2019s discussed and the more it\u2019s socially accepted, the less younger girls will feel ashamed/embarrassed about it.", "NTA. I'm a woman, talking about my or anyone else's periods with someone else makes me uncomfortable. If I can't deal with it myself I get over with asking for help as quickly as possible. You told him it made you uncomfortable and he still continued to talk about it.", "NAH. You're not required to have uncomfortable conversations, however it's wise to know your own body. You might want to look into WHY it's uncomfortable to discuss.\n\nNot many men are interested in the mechanics of a woman's body. I wouldn't discourage his interest, merely redirect his inquiries.\n\nYou're the woman of his life, so naturally his questions will go to you first.", "NAH.\n\nActually, the fact that he has curiosity about your health has some value to it, considering the many guys that has zero interest or care about a woman's anatomy. Knowing there is many people who are not aware of the different part of the male or female reproductive system, how they work or what they do is quite worrisome.\n\nOn the other hand, of course, you don't have to talk about it if you feel like he's not the type of person to have a serious and mature conversation with. Or if he's being creepy.\n\nIf anything, you could talk about periods and health and shit without referring to your experiences if you aren't comfortable talking about it, but I have a hard time seeing how scientific curiosity is a bad thing.\n\nIf he has, however, some kind of fascination for it... maaaaaybe then I'll be a bit more wary of his behaviour. It's a bodily function like any other, ain't worth going on essays about it, unless he's studying for his PHD or something.", "NTA. But you could maybe start sharing your own in-depth research into erectile dysfunction, if you want to return the favor...", "NTA. Not obligated to discuss that with him.", "NTA. I will commend your boyfriend for being willing to talk about periods--lord knows many men are unwilling--but I didn't say N A H because as soon as you put out a reasonable boundary (\"I don't want to talk about this\") he began pushing and trying to make you into the bad guy. I'm not gonna say he's abusive or that you should dump him, but I will say you should ask what he means by that \"you're never open with me\" comment. You have the right to say \"I don't wanna talk about this\" about your own body.", "NTA  You are very kind to put up with his BS.  If some dude started telling me about periods because he learned it on YouTube, I would probably have eviscerated him.", "NTA why is a man telling a woman what periods are? Mansplaining as it best. Does he think you are dumb or something?", "NTA ask him if he found out about bodily autonomy in his research. Periods are nothing to be ashamed of but your personal comfort is important above all else. Good on him for looking into it more but that gives him no right to pry information from you that you don\u2019t want to share.", "Him asking you at first doesn\u2019t make him an AH, but him continuing to pursue the questioning after you told him you\u2019re uncomfortable talking about it makes him the AH.\n\nNTA", "NTA - you felt uncomfortable and told him also what does he mean by \u2018not being honest with him \u2018 \n\neven if you were taking about periods with you friends , you might be insecure and find sharing that information uncomfortable to talk about with the opposite sex", "NAH. If you're not comfortable talking about this topic with him, that's your choice. Having said that, unless he's being condescending, grossed out, or buying into false info, he's not doing anything wrong. As long as he's being respectful and is interested in learning the truth, that's actually a good thing.", "NTA\n\nYou... and I can't believe I have to type this out... are under no obligation to talk to your boyfriend about menstruation.", "NTA.  That is some quality mansplaining.", "NTA - you set your boundary and he clearly pushed and broke it. Even if he knows people who openly share this stuff you chose not to", "Ask to see his internet search history, or maybe describe your bowel movements and see how \u201copen\u201d he still wants to be.  NTA you don\u2019t need to tell him every personal detail.  Everyone is entitled to a little privacy.", "NTA but I'm impressed. Most guys avoid that info like the plague.", "NTA, everyone has a right of privacy, but your bf doesnt seem like a bad guy, i dont know the whole context but it seems that maybe he tried to learn about it to be more supporting?", "Nta - your BF was mansplaining periods?  No need, thank you anyway BF.", "NAH\n\nYou are not obligated to discuss anything that makes you uncomfortable, however he is curious and wanting to know about an element of life he has no first hand experience with, and was not aware it made you uncomfortable. \n\nTell him what you are and are not comfortable discussing, and leave it at that. You aren't an asshole and neither is he.", "NTA. You are not obliged to cooperate in your boyfriend's research.", "I swear I had to double check the ages in this because I thought it was about kids in middle school.", "I mean, you aren't an asshole, but try to see that menstruation is just a natural process and there is nothing wrong it disgusting about it. Making it taboo only perpetuates the idea that it's something gross, shameful or unclean. I'm sorry that you don't feel comfortable talking about that even with your boyfriend. But again, you aren't an asshole for that.", "NTA. You\u2019re not obligated to be interested or listen to every single thing he tells you or researches. \n\nAlso, I legit never talk about periods with my friends. Lol", "NAH. You're not at all obligated to discuss it with him or anyone else, but it sounds like he's just trying to be better informed. Isn't that better than being one of those men who don't understand how periods work and freak out about buying menstrual products?", "NTA. Lol. Are you sure he isn\u2019t trying to \u201ctime\u201d your cycle? I dated someone like that once\u2026haaaha. Yeah nope. I mean general interest is one thing but\u2026 it\u2019s just a thought.", "NTA. Are you sure he\u2019s 24? I\u2019d ask him to keep his \u201cresearch\u201d to himself if you\u2019re not comfortable hearing about it or talking about it with him. He should respect that.", "Info: Why does it bother you?", "\" I told him he was being really weird \"\n\nYou did not lie here. NTA", "NTA....tell him you were doing some research on penises  and had some questions and concerns.", "At first I thought that maybe you were the AH, because it seems like he\u2019s trying to learn and relate, but then my husband and I were talking and he pointed out that it drives me nuts when he reads a wiki article on something having to do with my life or career and then tries to explain to me how that aspect of my life or career works, and what I should be doing. Periods would definitely fall into the category of things I\u2019m an expert in, that he\u2019s read a few articles on. And, he\u2019s right I would be annoyed.\n\n\n I\u2019m gonna go with a soft NTA, but you could have been more tactful , maybe.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to talk to your boyfriend about menstruation. It\u2019s cool if he wants to learn about it, but you don\u2019t have to talk to him about it if you don\u2019t want to.", "NTA. I find this very odd. Open is clearly a word that means wildly different things to different people.", "NTA. Do what you\u2019re comfortable with but consider that his interests may be genuine and not creepy.\n\nI had the benefit of a fairly liberal sex education. When I was about 8, my mother explained the mechanics of menstruation to me. Either I misunderstood significantly or my mother wasn\u2019t very comfortable and did not do a great job explaining it. Probably the former. While I understood the biology, I was wildly ignorant to the mechanics of it. It led to a pretty funny story including a big misunderstanding and some significant WTH side-eye from a girlfriend who, remarkably, continued dating me after. For a time, anyway.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know. Sometimes we don\u2019t even know the right questions to ask. I\u2019m in my 50s now. When I was in my teens and even my 20s, women didn\u2019t talk as freely about periods as it seems they do today. My daughters are very open and frank about their cycles. When my youngest got her first, it was me she asked to get her some pads, not her mother (neither of us understood why, but that\u2019s life).\n\nMy point is that he may be trying to be a better man. If you are able, help him get there.", "NTA. Your bf is trying to mansplain periods to you? LMAO.", "NTA. You're not obligated to discuss private matters with him.\nAlso, it sounds like he is mansplaining periods. Ugh. No.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your own personal medical history. You don't need to share it for him to plaster on YouTube", "YTA. That\u2019s the internalised misogyny talking. He\u2019s not pushing you to talk about your own periods, he was just mentioning the topic in general. Also a lot of people who menstruate have conversations about periods. It\u2019s just a body process, sure it\u2019s not something you\u2019d talk about with a stranger in the bus, but there\u2019s nothing weird about acknowledging it was happening.", "Honestly, I applaud him for looking this kind of stuff up - too many people, both men AND women, don't know nearly enough about the human body. However, you're also well in your right to say this isn't something you're interested in discussing. I'm gonna go with **NAH**", "\u2026.. I never heard a man interested in a woman\u2019s cycle that didn\u2019t cover their ears screaming \u201cLalalalalala I don\u2019t want to hear it!\u201d\n\nAlso, why would anyone like to talk about it?", "NAH - but I find it odd that you and your girlfriends don\u2019t talk about your periods.  And I actually think it\u2019s cool that he is interested in learning about this - many men are pretty clueless.", "It totally sucks how he is trying to learn more about you and your body. Who would want a partner like that?", "NAH why are you uncomfortable with it? Was he presenting in an a way that felt like it was patronizing or demeaning or was he genuinely interested in being more informed? Do you feel shame or embarrassment around periods or have you been taught not to discuss them with men?\n\nA man researching the variation in period experiences is a really good sign, like full on green flag, that he's a curious, empathetic, potentially feminist person. It's a good thing if it's genuine and respectful. So what issue did you have with his research or approach??", "NTA but it's not a bad topic of conversation. What I'd like to know is why he's interested?\n\nIs it because you act secretively because of internalised shame? Or because your mood/behaviour changes and he'd like to understand why? Or because he's hoping you'll have children and he's trying to get educated about reproduction in general? \n\nI think it's particularly telling that he asked you what you learnt in sex ed - so many schools don't even HAVE sex ed, and his might have been one of them, and he might be trying to catch up.\n\nINFO: have you asked him why he wants to know?", "YTA. He sounds like a caring guy and you are trying to suppress that because you have issues.", "NAH. He was trying to play an active role in a part of your life he doesn't have access too. Or, he was curious and trying to satisfy his curiousity. You had a boundary you didn't want to cross. While he should see your discomfort and drop it, it's fine for him to be disappointed.", "NAH. You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to, but you should be glad to have a partner that's actually going to understand if you need help with period stuff instead of panicking or \"Don't tell me about your period stuff, that's nasty, deal with it yourself.\" He'll be more likely to fetch you pain meds or a heating pad, make a tampon/pad run for you, and *actually* take care of you because he's doing his research.", "YTA. He was trying to learn more about women\u2019s bodies and more about you. This was a meaningful opportunity to create intimacy and you shut him down. Get over your period issues.", "No judgement - yet. We\u2019re you uncomfortable because discussing periods with anyone would make you feel that way? Uncomfortable because it\u2019s a male discussing it? Or uncomfortable that despite it being something we live with from a young age he may, just maybe now know more about the medical side of it than you - just because it\u2019s happening to us doesn\u2019t mean we understand it fully. \nOpen conversations about bodily functions are healthy, if you aren\u2019t comfortable doing this that\u2019s perfectly okay but others being comfortable isn\u2019t weird. \nWith 20+years more life experience I can tell you I\u2019ve discussed my cycle many a time with my partner over those years and it\u2019s nothing either side should be embarrassed about. \nHim persisting once you\u2019ve made yourself clear is wrong but calling him weird is also wrong.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You mentioned that he tends to research topics of interest.  Could just be him being overzealous about sharing new info with someone who experiences said topic.

I was originally gonna say N T A given that it's clear he's pushing a clear boundary but you also make a solid point about how the BF's energy on this, while perhaps a bit much, is still at least on a parallel track towards destigmatizing women's health.  Guy just needs to be sure not to be too intense about it (I know this personally since I studied medicine and would eat lunch while viewing autopsies... re-learning how to develop verbal filters with regards to body stuff was A Thing).\n\nSo add my vote to NAH.", "From the sound of it, it could very well be a *temporary* fascination with it, simply because he has very likely been poorly educated about it and is eager to share because it\u2019s new and all these things never occurred to him.\n\nAnd, to be frank, there are way too many women out there who are just as poorly educated and actually don\u2019t know all that stuff. I personally know a girl who got pregnant at 15, raised by an old school Catholic Italian grandma who didn\u2019t explain periods or sex at all. Girl had zero idea her period wasn\u2019t a God-given curse, no idea she\u2019d had sex, and didn\u2019t know she was in labor until the baby popped out.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to look at it as him as mansplaining, but he might have more education about periods than 50% of American women right now.", "Yeah I think you\u2019re right here.

These things don't happen to all cis men but most healthy cis women have periods. Talking about physical health is important and a monthly occurrence of pain, hormonal distress, sloughing the inside of an organ out... is kind of important to be able to talk about casually with one's partner.

You don't just have unprotected sex and boom you're pregnant? I think so many get it drilled into their heads as young girls that \"you can get pregnant AT ANY TIME\", and there is so little information given on how to get to know and understand your own body, and that there are actually fertile/non fertile windows and things like that. \n\nI understand the reasoning for telling young girls they can get pregnant at any time, just that as adults many women don't tend to learn much past that.

As someone like this, I find it so appalling that the reaction is he is a horn dog or mainsplaining, like can men not care about how it effects their SO or what it feels like?

No where did he push her to talk about it, he found out she was uncomfortable and wanted to know why, she can tell him why or not, but again he can ask. Just the same as she doesn\u2019t have to discuss it you can\u2019t make him not ask questions. He has every right as she does to refuse to answer them.
