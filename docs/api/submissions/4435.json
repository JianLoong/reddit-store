Neither of my parents were practicing at all and they're both actually very liberal, but whenever they wanted to criticize me, suddenly they were the picture of virtue and godliness and they expected me to be a caretaker for my brothers. They were very neglectful and verbally abusive towards me growing up. Additionally, I have two brothers. One older, one younger. Both of my parents have described themselves as either a 'boy mom' or a 'boy dad' who had 'no clue how to raise a daughter'. Essentially, they abused me using a religion they barely adhered to themselves and held me up to standards they did not fit.\n\nI'm also a naturally very shy person and I suck at confrontation. When I was getting married, my parents would go on and on for ages about how I'd finally learn to be obedient and a 'good woman'. \n\nMy husband also comes from the same background that I do although we're both barely religious now so I decided to use this to my advantage. I'm not mentally prepared to deal with the drama that'd come with trying to go NC or LC, so when I moved out of their home and into my husband's home, I told them my husband didn't give me permission to visit them whenever they'd ask when I was visiting. Obviously, my husband wasn't preventing me from doing anything and I had his permission to do this. He is very happy with being the bad guy in this situation and there are no consequences he could face from this, we discussed it in depth before I did it. When they asked why, I said that he wanted us to lead a more godly life and he didn't approve of their lifestyle.  I used this excuse every time they tried to get me to meet them until they gave up. \n\n\nGiven their treatment of me growing up, I didn't think that they'd give a shit about me potentially being abused or what not but my older brother turned up to my house yesterday extremely concerned. He said that our parents had told him that my husband was controlling and he wanted to know if I was safe. Just a PSA, I have never been close to my brother and he refused to help every time I asked him to stop our parents from being horrible to me so I politely told him the truth about the situation and sent him on his way. \n\nHe hasn't told our parents the truth, but he's calling me an asshole for worrying them. I honestly don't think I'm wrong because they raised me to follow these rules and they abused me and because of the abuse I don't have the mental strength to cut them off in any other way because they will go to any lengths to interfere in my life.

You owe them nothing. The way they raised you shows a complete lack of respect. If they don\u2019t like it too bad.", "NTA - they want you to be a woman that obeys the man, they got what they wanted", "NTA. If they were so concerned why did the absent brother show up and not them after how long??? You (your parents) reap what you sow. I find it WIIIIIILD they didn\u2019t give a shit about your \u201ccontrolling husband\u201d the first time you said he didn\u2019t allow you autonomy to visit. I also am not surprised they cherry pick their faith when it applies to the situation they need.", "NTA on the grounds that this is the funniest possible way to go low contact. I'm glad you got away from all that!", "NTA to them, necessarily, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing YOURSELF any favors by not living openly in your truth. \n\nTherapy may help you work through your feelings about your upbringing so you can move on and either go NC or find the strength to approach your past with your family head on.", "NTA, wait, it's not cool to them if your husband is controlling and abusive, but it's fine when it's them?", "NTA. You turned their misogynistic rhetoric around on them. They\u2019re not concerned about you being abused, they\u2019re just upset that they don\u2019t get to be your abusers anymore. Cut them off for good.", "NTA.  Your husband is not \"allowing\" with your full support and, in complete agreement in not going to visit an abusive household.\n\nYou kinda was telling the truth.  I don't think any wonderful spouse would want their loved one to go to an abusive situation.", "NTA\nIt may not be honest, but it's probably better than bluntly telling them that they were abusive. Religious \"sometimers\" always find a way to sound things in their favor.,. \"It was for your own good\", or \"you needed to be stronger/better\". Your brothers are both TA for not having your back growing up, but your parents are the ultimate AH's for raising the three of you the way they did \nLove your best life with your loving husband. You deserve to be happy!", "NTA\n\nBut maybe take it one step further and have your husband tell them he doesn\u2019t want them contacting you anymore. Then you are NC and it\u2019s not on you at all.", "NTA and we\u2019ll played. You\u2019re not obligated to maintain relationships with people who treat you poorly and I\u2019d say using a religion as a cudgel to beat down their daughter fits the very definition of poorly (and many other things if we\u2019re honest but my fingers can only do so much typing). Some people think that the option of jettisoning family doesn\u2019t exist but it really does. \n\nI\u2019ll often take notes on peoples bullshit and bank it until I can throw that shit back at them or use it to my advantage. I\u2019m also a big fan of asking embarrassing questions when people treat me badly or make socially unacceptable comments (racism, homophobia, ableism etc). Do with that what you will.", "NTA but pretending you're being abused feels ugly in the face of how many women are genuinely abused. I'm sure your partner is lovely but if that ever changed, I would hate for people not to believe you and use this against you in the future. Honestly I would just tell your family you have broken contact because they abused you and then block them.", "You have every right to distance yourself from parents who abused you as a child and if you're not ready to tell them the truth as to why you won't visit, your lie is at least providing you some cover. NTA. \n\nI would suggest therapy so that you can have some help processing the way you've been mistreated. I know there's a stigma associated with therapy, and I'm guessing this is true of the religion you were raised in. However, a therapist can help you to determine how to handle your relationship with your parents in a way that you're comfortable with. \n\nAt the moment, you're relying on your brother to keep your secret and your parents have a negative opinion of your husband that could lead to arguments in the future. It's working for now but you need to be prepared if it falls apart on you. Good luck, be safe, and please update us on how things go.", "NTA for  not visiting your parents,  but you are for lying about the reason.\n\nYou're a grown adult now, so act like one and tell them the truth, that it's their own actions that have led to you not having contact. If you don't they will always harbour resentment to your husband for keeping you from them, when it's not the truth.\n\nIt's hypocritical to hide behind a religion that you're not following, just to make your life easier.", "From the post I came safely assume you're not 12...so stop acting like you're 12. Unless you lied and are in fact 12, then you're doing fine.", "ESH. \n\nYour parents clearly suck. However you shouldn't have used your husband as a pawn to lie to them.\n\nBe honest.

Where was this care and worry when I was growing up?\u201d \n\nBut also, you could\u2019ve handled this better going LC/ NC despite the drama is better and healthier for both parties. Because now they will continue to worry you\u2019re being abused and I guarantee you if this keeps up they might even call the police. On top of that, they would have learned absolutely nothing, tell them exactly why you chose to cut contact with them. Be frank, be honest, be strong. \n\nThey seem to care a bit at least, they might want to mend the relationship and try to be better grandparents for your kids. \n\nI don\u2019t know, I wish you luck op.", "YTA - As much as I'd like to say nta because if the abuse... you're lying, then involving more people in the lying. Your brother hasn't said anything yet, but it's obvious the lying is causing problems. Eventually this could snowball abd become Major Drama.\n\nYou HAVE TO get better at standing up for yourself. Get therapy. Get proper advice for boundary setting or going NC. You owe it to yourself more than anyone else in this situation.", "ESH\n\nAt some point you need to have a real discussion with them and accept the fruit of that talk. Just be upfront about the hurt and boundaries. No point in making a scapegoat out of your husband. They will just blame and hate him after a while.", "YTA for lying and involving your husband because you want to avoid confronting YOUR parents.\n\nYou're an adult, and being very disrespectful putting that onto him as an excuse.", "YTA, unfortunately, because it's totally unnecessary.

When they need to use misogyny to make you do what they wanted, misogyny was virtuous. When that was preventing you from doing what they wanted, it was \"abuse.\"\n\nTheir past treatment of you is inconsistent with genuine concern about more abuse form another source now. I truly don't believe they're actually concerned about you; they just want more access to you because they want you to keep taking care of your brothers.

Honestly, the experiences you had seem really toxic and traumatic, and if you feel that way about them, you need to start owning up to that and dealing with it. You're going to keep having to make excuses as to why you're not around if you don't. Eventually, it won't  work, and what then? It will blow up. Instead of lying about it, eventually you're going to have to say 'Hey you know the way you guys raised me was pretty terrifying and I have a lot of baggage from it. I don't really like being around such a hostile place.' They're not going to take that well, but that's not really the point is it? The point is to not lie about why you're uncomfortable, or consistently use your husband as the excuse. Granted, it is a stroke of brilliance to use their own sexist logic against them. So like 10 out of 10 for that, but you never actually really deal with the problem by just lying about it.", "NTA.    I absolutely love what you have done.

And can I just say it is *brilliant* to tell them that your husband is restricting you from visiting them because you're trying to lead a more godly life and *they're* too heathen to be around? I'm cackling. Beautiful!\n\nGoing LC or NC may be a lot of drama to deal with in the short term, but I think in the long term you'll be so much happier if you get them out of your life. If you feel up to it, let them know exactly why you're doing it; if you don't, utilize your strategy of saying you're trying to be more holy and let your brother explain the real reasons *after* you've cut them out.

I wonder whether he will tell your parents.", "NTA.  In fact, I admire your genius.  But now that you've told your brother, he might share your plan with your folks.  In which case, go ahead and tell them the truth that you've shared here.  \"You were neglectful and abusive to me as a child, using religion as a cudgel, and now that I've escaped and have a wonderful life with my husband, I've decided not to see you for a while.  Perhaps if you hadn't been abusive, things would be different.\"  It doesn't matter if this hurts their feelings; it's the truth.  You owe them nothing.  Congratulations on finding a great partner and moving on.", "You're NTA as such but pretending you're being abused is not a sustainable way to deal with this. You say there would be not consequences to your husband, but there already has been since your brother has already been to check on you. \nWhat if your parents were to get the police involved?", "NTA whatever is best for you! My husband is also my \u201cget outta jail free card\u201d from my parents. It\u2019s nice having someone who understands and doesn\u2019t mind", "And imo certainly not such a lie. This is so stupid. Just tell them *you* don't wanna go\n\nThis kind of lying is only keeping up such norms, even if its only a lie for you. Like I dont get it. Why. They can't do anything to you. Why play this dumb game\n\nLike obviously you aren't TA but this is just sad", "THIS!!!!", "She\u2019s not pretending to be abused, she\u2019s pretending to be all in on the patriarchal family (that she already grew up in, even though it was more liberal).", "She doesn't owe them shit.", "No it's not. And abuse victims can protect themselves any way they see fit and that's okay. Who are you exactly to determine the best way for OP to do that? I'm surprised this post is still up to be honest, as abuse being involved is an automatic NTA and a takedown."]}
