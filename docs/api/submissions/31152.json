In general she is a good person but she has one habit that drives me up the wall. She doesn\u2019t listen and will do what she think is polite even if the other person tells her not to.\n\nFor example, her BIL asked for no presents for his birthday ( he has some trauma  with birthdays and gifts) and just get dinner with everyone. Well she got him a huge present that he didn\u2019t want. It was really awkward and hurt him a lot.\n\nShe does this will food a lot, anyone is hosting she will bring food as a hostess gift, the main problem is that is always needs something done to it when they get there. Time in the oven, or needs to stay cold and I don\u2019t have the fridge space. Also she is usually late to event due to her job.\n\nThis has been a problem for most of the family with her, we have talked to her and she doesn\u2019t stop. In short it is disrespectful to completely ignore what we are saying and do the one thing we don\u2019t want.\n\nLast thanksgiving was a nightmare, she was late and her casserole needed time in the oven. So all the food was done but hers. I talked to her and then she pulled the same thing at Christmas. Talked to her again, and then it happened again. We have suggested bringing any other hostess gift but food and she doesn\u2019t listen. At this point it feels like a fuck you, I won\u2019t listen to what you want. She is bad guest and my son (her husband) can\u2019t really help since he is deployed and not at most events.\n\nI informed her last month if she brings any food to thanksgiving I will kick her out. I sent a text today reminding her to please not bring any food. I got a call from my daughter telling me she plans go bring food.\n\nWIBTA to kick her out when she brings food.\n\nI also have tried not reheating it and giving it back, she got pissed and made comments all night.

If she's consistently late because of work but feels compelled to bring food for whatever strange reason, then she needs to be showing up with a bottle of wine or something shelf stable that doesn't require any effort beyond opening a package. Honestly I'd probably just not invite her to anything going forward. Don't have to kick her out if she's not there.", "This behavior is weird. Like, does she have compulsions or mental health problems? You would totally within your rights to kick her out. But honestly, it would not be my hill to die on if she is otherwise pleasant. I would just not let her actions effect me. Arrives late with a dish that requires time in the oven? \"Sorry DIL, we are eating at 1, you will have more of your dish to take home.\" Arrives to a party with a big gift? \"Thank you for the thought but we aren't doing gifts, you can keep it or donate it to worthy cause.\"\n\nEdited to add NTA", "NTA.

If you have already told her, you will kick her out if she comes with food for Thanksgiving you have to kick her out.

She is never going to learn until you stop letting her come to events because she\u2019s not listening. I know you said your son is deployed, but does he know what\u2019s going on? Because when you kick her out the first person she\u2019s gonna complain to the next time she talks to him is her husband, your son.

Maybe when her unwanted offering is wasted she'll finally understand.", "NTA, but I think I'd personally handle it differently.  I'd let her bring the food.  If it needs to go in the oven, she is the one who has to do it and it only goes in once everything else is all done.  If it's not done in time with all the other stuff, then it doesn't get served.  In short, make it her problem and make it so she went through all the trouble to make the food for nothing.  If she complains, you tell her that you've told her in the past to not bring stuff.", "YWNBTA\n\nYou have made this quite clear, if she arrives with food turn her round and send her on her way.", "NTA clearly \n\nBut I would be speaking to your son her husband \n\nI know he\u2019s deployed but he a) needs to know how much she\u2019s upsetting his family and b) why she\u2019s not invited/being thrown out of a family meal \n\nShe\u2019ll be getting in her side of the story.

Shock is your only option left.", "NTA. This sounds really strange. I have to ask, you don't have to answer, but: Do you otherwise like her?

Maybe she\u2019ll get the message that way.", "NTA.  Maybe this year do a group chat with everyone including her deployed husband.  Lay out your case politely explain the toll it takes on you and the inconvenience and the overall strangeness of her being rude by sort of trying to be polite.  Ask for suggestions on the best course of action from everyone involved.  I think this is a tactical nuke approach as opposed to full out mutually assured destruction.

If she brings something that needs an oven, you don\u2019t have the space/time to cook it. If it is a refrigerator item, you don\u2019t have the room in the refrigerator. My SIL does this. I\u2019ve flat out told her not to bring anything as we have it covered and she always says she cannot show up without being something as it would be rude.  She usually always shows up with sweets like cookies etc.  We don\u2019t touch them and they go in the trash when she leaves .", "NTA. Bringing something that needs assembly, storage, cooking, or ANY work from the hostess is super rude\u2014unless they have specifically requested said item. It\u2019s not just food items\u2014you should never bring flowers as a gift unless they are already trimmed and in a vase. \n\nThis is some sort of weird ass power play by DIL, where she can hide behind \u201cbeing hurt\u201d if you don\u2019t finish preparing (or whatever) the food that she so \u201cgenerously\u201d brought. OP needs to shut that shit down, even if it sounds and feels rude or harsh in the moment. DIL is the rude one.", "I could have written an almost identical post about my mother on Christmas. It would be too much trouble for her to make what I suggested when she asked, so instead of bringing nothing she brought something completely different. She would always be late, and show up just as I had everyone set up with a drink and a seat and could start to relax a little, so I\u2019d have to rearrange for her and get what she needed. Plus she\u2019d have boxes and bags of gifts for me to put out and deal with the trash, etc. before she proceeded with making herself the center of attention and find some way to insult my in-laws or me, then blame that on her medication.", "Throw her food in the trash.\n\nShe needs a kick to the head in order to listen.\n\nY'all should have thrown out the traumatic gift as well.\n\nNTA", "I want to say that you shouldn't kick her out, because family, blah blah holidays, but honestly FOUR YEARS? I would say, text her that if she brings food it will not be served.  If she doesn't like it, don't come.  If she comes and brings food, don't serve it.  If she complains, THEN KICK HER OUT.  Honestly though, if you want to kick her out the second she arrives with food, I don't think that I would fault you for it.  This isn't like it is food that she needs to eat because of a specialized diet, she is just being unreasonable.  Ugh, NTA. YWNBTA.  I just can't even believe how childish she is being.", "NTA. However, I would tell your son what you\u2019re planning to do ahead of time so he has the option to relay the message. If your son knows that his wife is doing this and hasn\u2019t taken a single step to correct the actions that you and the rest of your family has told him are not welcome, they\u2019re both getting what they deserve if she shows up with food and gets kicked out. \n\nFor all the people saying it\u2019s nuclear to kick her out for bringing food, what would you do if it was an abusive family member DIL was bringing to dinner and insisting be not just allowed in, but then catered to?? She has been told repeatedly not to bring the abusive family member (the food) to dinner, but does do repeatedly knowing it\u2019s at the discomfort of many others, and not even a direct benefit to her! Yet, she does it anyway bc they\u2019ve let her up until now. \n\nKicking her out is a necessary step if she continues to force this on you and your household.", "NTA. She is very direespectful and rude. Kicking her out might be the wake up call she needs.", "NTA - It's important to set boundaries and maintain a respectful environment. If your DIL has been repeatedly disregarding your requests and causing discomfort, it's understandable to consider taking action. You've already tried communicating and compromising, and it seems like kicking her out is your last resort.", "Carla I have asked you repeatedly not to bring food. Its not that we dislike it it but I have no fridge/stove room and no time to process an additional item. Your presence is contribution enough and there is always plenty to eat. \nSo why do you persist.? If it happens again you will just have to leave no one wants this drama and disrespect. OK? Ok.\nAnd she is not late bc of her job.

Do not accept it if she attempts to hand it to you, do not allow her to delay the meal-if she\u2019s late, start on time w/o her, do not allow her in your kitchen to bake/chop/chill whatever.

Your DIL is clearly disregarding what you have asked her to do, and that sucks. \n\nHowever, this seems like a ridiculous hill to die on, especially since you mention that she is otherwise perfectly pleasant. If you zoom out a bit, her husband is deployed, she has no nearby family, and she likely feeling that her MIL doesn\u2019t allow her to contribute.\n\nI was raised in the Midwest and it is completely possible to have two or three very distinct midwestern sub cultures in a single town. It is completely plausible that she had this drilled into her growing up. Some people are even taught that it is polite to protest or decline, and that you must return that politeness by ignoring the protest. It boggles the mind. \n\nThis has clearly become a close to home issue (literally), and throwing her food out or worse, kicking her out of Thanksgiving, will likely only escalate the issue, which will get back to your active duty son from his wife\u2019s perspective. You are both grown women who love the same person, you should both be able to find a respectful resolution because letting this tank your relationship with each other would be ridiculous. \n\nI know you say you\u2019ve tried everything, but I haven\u2019t seen any mention of a discussion at a neutral location.

It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t appreciate the effort, the problem is the logistical challenges it creates in my kitchen, since space and time are limited.  I value our relationship, and I don\u2019t want you to feel iced out, so I\u2019m hoping you can explain to me why bringing a dish specifically is so important to you? I ask because when I say I would prefer a bottle of wine, or give you an assigned item to bring, I am being perfectly serious. I would hate for this to turn into an issue that never resolves, and it seems silly to catch Son in the middle of something we are perfectly capable of solving ourselves. Can you please help me understand?\u201d\n\nGo from there. It is HARD to put yourself in the other person\u2019s position when what they are doing seems so totally bizarre to you.

Also say if your dish needs to be kept cool to make sure to bring a cooler with ice.  Then, when she brings her stuff,  smile sweetly and tell her that your stuff will be ready at x time and she can have the oven when you are done.

Pick an event and tell her she's hosting, then have everyone show up with a food item that needs some sort of intervention. Try to time people's arrival so they're staggered over an hour or two.

I understand you are upset about the birthday thing, but unless she was given enough information, I could see myself making this kind of flub if I was just told no gifts. Loads of people say no gifts because they don\u2019t want to sound greedy, but people still show up with gifts that are happily accepted.\n\nFor the food, I understand your exasperation, and why you feel like you\u2019ve run out of options. Rather than continuing to strong arm, or ban her from bringing food, have you talked to her about why she does this? That you would be perfectly happy to have her bring food that is ready to be eaten, or does not require more than five minutes in the kitchen (eg tossing a salad). I find it interesting that you call the food a hostess gift which this really isn\u2019t. She\u2019s a part of your family and it sounds like she wants to be included in bringing food like other people are. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of her job is the reason why she doesn\u2019t have the time like she wants to get together things necessary before coming over to your house. But if it isn\u2019t you, I think somebody needs to talk to her from a empathetic place to try to understand what\u2019s really at the bottom of this behavior. Only by addressing that issue can we get to a solution that doesn\u2019t involve kicking your daughter-in-law out of your house and leaving her alone on holidays.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I think you went about last year completely the wrong way. Yes, she showed up late with a casserole that needed time in the oven. If the rest of the food was ready to go, then you can start dinner with the rest of the food, but still put hers in the oven. And, if it\u2019s ready in time, let people take a sampling when they come around for seconds and let people take servings if they are bringing a plate home of leftovers. Just handing it back to her before she left was the wrong move because it is a rejection of her, not necessarily the food.

If you can get at why she refuses, you might find a solution.  \n\nFor example, if the former, can you get her to bring either an appetizer or dessert that does require heating or refrigeration, which doesn\u2019t affect the main meal if she shows up late.  If the latter, ask her to bring flowers or drinks or something specific that everyone can enjoy and she can take credit for.", "ESH.\n\nShe sucks for obvious reasons, but really, a family food-oriented event and you don't let other people bring food? I just wouldn't come if those were the conditions. I like to cook and share, too. \n\nBut yeah, if this is your hill to die on, you have warned her, so if she shows up with food, kick her out and turn off your phone for the day. Keep doing it every time.\n\nBut also, consider that it's pretty traditional to bring food to Thanksgiving. I've never even attended one in almost fifty years where people didn't bring food. The best ones are when we actually coordinate, though.", "She reminds me of one of my relatives. When I hosted, I would ask her to bring a dish, and for a couple of years, she would be late and would need to assemble it at my house. One year, I got sick of it and I also made the dish I asked her to bring so the rest of my guests would have a complete meal without waiting for her. She was upset when she walked in late with her casserole dish and ingredients and everyone was mid meal. When she made a comment, I told her that she knew what time dinner would be served and she can go home if she has an issue. I think she wanted the attention from the hoopla her antics caused because she got somewhat better once everyone ignored her and stopped catering to her.", "In that case they need to take their lead from the host and adjust their offerings. It has been communicated vehemently that casseroles, refrigerated items, things that require cooking, and large birthday presents for BIL are unwanted; if she MUST show up with something in hand wine, flowers, or chocolates work just as well as a host or birthday celebration gift.", "This comment gives me an idea I haven\u2019t seen yet, since she\u2019s always late are they already eating? Or waiting for her? Fudge the time by 15-30 minutes and start eating. No one can expect the host/ess to leave the table and cook again because one person was late with unprepared food.", "Was that in a comment somewhere? Because all I\u2019m seeing is that the food needs time in the oven or it\u2019s cold and needs fridge space. Time in the oven is a pretty common occurrence for Thanksgiving food, where people are bringing dishes to contribute. If people have time, we always ask that they at least heat it to a temperature that\u2019s still comfortable to handle before coming over, but sometimes because of other obligations in the morning, we have to receive it ice cold. So it goes in the oven, but it\u2019s by no means raw.", "Was the issue then that she refused to bake it herself and had you do it? Was it too late for dessert once it was done?", "This is so strange and sounds beyond frustrating though I\u2019m not sure kicking her out upon arrival is the answer. Curious how she transported an uncooked cheesecake isn\u2019t it basically liquid? I\u2019d say if she complains during dinner remind her she\u2019d been told not to bring anything and that the meal wouldn\u2019t delay for her. if complaints persist more after being told to stop then suggest she leave. I wonder how she\u2019d be if hosting?", "Washing and chopping up a salad would take like 15min max. Cheesecake, just put it in the oven to bake while you eat or refrigerate or whatever the fuck you need to do to a cheesecake. You guys are acting like it\u2019s such a huge burden.", "Put it in the microwave and nuke it.", "Yes it's in the comments. The DIL has found a way to be a pain where she can fain politeness. Showing up late and delaying the meal further when she could just show up empty handed is rude. If she really wanted to show appreciation she could order a flower arrangement or bring chocolates or whatever else she cleared with the host.", "You've obviously never hosted a large gathering where you did the majority of the cooking. 15 minutes when you are already late is a burden. Not a huge one but a burden. If the DIL didn't throw a fit if her offering sat in the kitchen unused you would have a point but DIL makes a big deal. That's an additional issue. It is rude!", "15 min max when you're already time a Thanksgiving dinner?  Seriously?  And what about work surface and preparation supplies like knives and cutting board?  The sink?  Cheesecake takes hours and you can't eat it the day it bakes because it needs to chill overnight.  Maybe the person being annoyed and interrupted in their preparations needs not to be blamed for the problem, and not get advice from someone who doesn't know anything about cheesecake.", "We are all so glad you don\u2019t have any traumas. Yay for you. Read her comments. It was dinner I didn\u2019t see anything about a party. \n\nAs for the food, again, read her comments. The dil doesn\u2019t even cook it. Couldn\u2019t even bring a salad. It had to be put together, nothing was cut up. \n\nReading comprehension is a real thing taught in grade school.", "\"Please don't gift me a puppy, I'm allergic!\" -but puppies are SUCH A NICE GIFT", "Your attitude is disgusting. All BIL did was ask politely for no gifts.\n\nY'know what the actual polite thing to do is? What is actually good manners? To respect others are different, like different things, have different experiences and different expectations\n\nSo, if someone specifically asks you NOT to do something, you respect that. It's THAT. SIMPLE\n\nIt's NOT controlling to spend years asking for someone not to do something, then finally reach the end of your tether about it\n\nBut you go ahead and continue to double down on attacking OP as if you know the situation best from a singular post and dismissing someone's trauma because it seems silly to you. Because you are such a KIND person", "Pssst.. are you the DIL?", "She\u2019s already said she\u2019s tried everything else. This IS her last resort. Look through the window and if she\u2019s carrying food, shake your head and lock the doors.", "Yeah but surely there\u2019s been time for a conversation sometime in the last four years?", "Yes! Throw it away.", "Yup that's what I would do.  Looking at her the WHOLE TIME.", "Have you tried it with food? For some reason this is her weird thing. Have you been like please bring dessert, or please bring the dinner rolls or a baguette? \n\nOr does it seem like what she actually wants is to take some of your\u2026glory/status by always **making** a dish?\n\nHave you tried calling her the day off and being like \u201care you bringing something? Ok, I won\u2019t have fridge space/oven time\u201d or \u201cok, it\u2019ll have to wait in the garage as I won\u2019t have space\u201d.\n\nAt this point, find ways to meet in the middle. Her husband is deployed, she still wants to be part of your family. She\u2019s an AH but you know. Probably worth it to compromise to an extent.", "Calm down drama queen it\u2019s a fucking salad.", "I feel like you've told her and told her and now you've promised to throw her out.  It's like dealing with a child.  At this point if you don't follow through, she'll never believe you in the future.\n\nI'd say WHEN she brings food, and you know she will, meet her at the door, tell her that while she is welcome, as per the text, her food is not.  When she starts complaining: what do I do with this? It'll go bad in the car! It's just X food! You're being mean! Remind her again of the stipulations of the invite.\n\nShe protests a second time, you tell her while you're sad to see her go, you understand and accept her choice.\n\nClose the door.\n\nMy 3 yr old regularly needs reminders that if the choice is A or B and you refuse to pick A, you're picking B.  She's a grown woman.\n\nThe only question is, do you think she'll stay AND complain?  Because if so, make that a stipulation as well.  She picks to ditch the food and come in, let her know that if she complains she will be asked to leave.  Follow through.  You e chosen now to make the stand, go with it.\n\nNTA", "Ask your DIL to host? That way she can cook for everyone. And everyone arrives with their own dish, which everyone insists on her reheating. And you all only eat the dishes you brought. \n\nThat would solve the issue I'm sure.", "Maybe ask her to bring wine. It won't matter if it's on time and she'll feel like she's being helpful and then you can drown out your irritation with her.", "When you answer the door, if she has anything on her hands tell her to put it back in the car. If she says no, shut the door. That's it.", "Just uninvited her entirely. Explain why and let her spend Thanksgiving alone. Not your problem anymore.", "Take the food straight to the garbage can?", "> fresh whole grapes\n\nLMAO. And a barrel for aging.", "My hunch is that she wants the status and glory of making a really good dish that people will gush over. \n\nWhich is why telling her home-baked rolls or dessert is likely a solution. Give her the damn applause. She\u2019s like a kid at someone else\u2019s party who has to be the center of attention. Also explains why she likes disrupting OP\u2019s timing in the kitchen.", "It's a salad.  As I said, what about the work surface and preparation supplies like knives and cutting board.  Sink.  Interrupting the organization of the meal, as in getting everything out at the right time?  If you can only insult people instead of actually responding in a reasonable way, eh.  Address the questions.", "Completely disregarding a host's explicit and repeated requests = huge amounts of etiquette?  Uhh...no.", "Continually giving even when told no is not etiquette. It's satisfying your own ego", "This is hilarious, but my suggestion would be bringing everything she says not to bring.", "Who's ready to learn origami today! \ud83d\ude02", "Maybe it's time to... stop inviting her?", "He has a phone and email\u2026.", "This is the point where you cut heroff and treat her like the child she is acting \n\nDil, I've repeatedly told you stop bringing food. It's rude and disrespectful because your food is not needed or wanted and and is not ready to cook and we do not have time nor do we want to wait for the food to cook. I've asked you to stop and this is the last time your rude behavior is not ok and it is not polite. Stop bringing food or you won't be invited back. I won't argue with it about and I dont want to hear and complaints. Do what is asked or don't come.", "Also, the added layer of rudeness of expecting everyone/the entire rest of the meal to wait on the unasked for dish you brought late that also needs prep time", "This would be dope... if she didn't ruin everyone's night with a pissy attitude after being told no.\n\nSend her rude ass HOME", "Oh my gosh lol \n\nOr accept that she\u2019s an AH and this is her weird thing, and say, listen, if you bring anything it will not fit in the fridge or the oven. Please bring rolls, or a dessert.", "Very good points. OP should definitely follow those instructions.", "If I had some gold, I'd give it to you so take my upvotre", "Which is wild because all she\u2019s doing is pissing people off and making herself look like an ass.", "That's actually an excellent idea! In psychology, they call something similar \"training an incompatible behavior\". I.e., one way to get rid of behavior B is to train up behavior C which is incompatible with B. Now, it doesn't have to be *literally* incompatible for it to be effective, just something that makes less B less likely.\n\nIn this case, u/Capital-Astronaut669, if you don't want her to bring a casserole, you can always ask her to bring <X>, where <X> is something that's convenient for you to have her bring. Maybe ask her to bring two (or five, etc.) big bags of ice, if that's useful to you?", "Yours is definitely good but I want to get the word \"casserole\" in there somewhere."]}
