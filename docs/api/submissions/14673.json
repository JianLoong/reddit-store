I said I\u2019m not trying to be ungrateful but they\u2019re worse than most of the regular clothes, even the most worn ones. She got mad and stormed out, and I threw the suits in the garbage (if you saw them you would too, they had holes and everything).

You stated your case and even came up with a compromise solution. At 15, I would think that you should have some say in what you are wearing", "NTA - if stores don\u2019t accept swimsuits return because of hygienic reasons then you don\u2019t have to accept hand me down swimsuits. That\u2019s literally gross especially the one with a rotting waistband. \n\nI also don\u2019t understand why they called you spoiled if you accept hand me downs just fine.

Your parents are taking this handing down things too far.   You are 15, you are old enough to grow out of just hand me downs and have your own style.

My mum always got us new swimmers when my siblings and I needed them and she had 8 kids.", "NTA. If they wanted to be *that* eco-friendly they shouldn\u2019t have had kids.

You offered to buy your own suit, and your mother still insisted on your wearing the ratty one?!  I would not call that spoiled or bratty.

Also, once I was old enough to care, my mom let me choose my clothing. A lot of the stuff my sister liked was stuff I would never wear. She was almost 6 years older and very 90s. Like, no thank you, I am not wearing funky vests. Yes, vests. Yikes. I loved dresses so I wore dresses. It is cruel to make a child wear clothing they hate, but especially cruel to make them wear nasty holes clothing. You deserve to have nice clothing and not look nasty in holey worn our clothes. \n\nYou are willing to buy your own clothes. That is NOT being spoiled. Nor is it being wasteful! These clothes have already been worn by 3 people. Time to toss or make quilts or something. I am curious. What does your mom's swimsuit look like? Cuz personally, I would replace her swimsuit with the rotting one. Do it right before you leave.

Ooooh...", "No one may be owed new clothing, but the parents have created a system where one child gets new, on trend clothing, the next child gets slightly worn, probably still trending clothing, but the OP always gets old, worn, probably no longer in fashion clothing.\n\nI have only older brothers, no older sisters, but I still wore mostly hand me downs. I had my brothers\u2019 baby clothes, no pink for me! And as I got older and needed dresses, Mom got hand me downs from various cousins who were much older than me, so the clothes were massively out of date and got me teased a lot.\n\nThe OP\u2019s situation is just not equitable.\n\nWhile I cannot argue with the parents\u2019 motivations, a few new outfits, including a new swimsuit, every year for each kid will not be what send the climate over the edge.

What does that mean? \n\nHere\u2019s a real shocker for you\u2014parents can treat their kids in ways that aren\u2019t equitable, but are still okay.

And I\u2019d be okay with that. \n\nAnd while you are correct that no one is owed new clothing, I personally would not want to set up that much of a discrepancy in the way my children were treated.
