Also just to answer some questions and statements: because I have done injuries I exercise in a pretty sterile environment that\u2019s only used by a couple other people and cleaned daily. Because of this my shoes that I use indoors and to work out are pretty much spotless. I do see how it is disgusting but my shoes are pretty damn clean.

It's not even particularly unusual. My grandparents are diabetic and are supposed to wear shoes at all times. Their shoes are also pricy, so they typically only have one pair at a time due to insurance restrictions.
