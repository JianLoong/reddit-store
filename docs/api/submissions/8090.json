She was from the northern US where air conditioning is not a given, but we were living in student housing at our school in Texas where AC is super common (and important, since lots of people die every year in Texas from heat-related issues). She would set the thermostat to 80+ degrees every single friggin' day, and our air conditioner was so old and inefficient that even if I reset it as soon as I got home, it would still be in the upper seventies six hours later, when I was trying to sleep (it was great for my insomnia /s). This went on for a YEAR, despite the clause in our lease which stated that the unit had to have its AC set to at least 75 degrees or cooler at all times  - our school was on a barrier island, and between the heat and the humidity, the school housing would become infested with mold super fast without AC. She never seemed to give AF that she was in violation of our lease, or that I had a heart condition that left me susceptible to overheating, or grasped the notion that she could always put on extra layers, get a heater for her room, etc.... and never mind all the research about optimum sleeping temperatures for human beings. She'd just slam that damn thermostat all the way up every time she walked by it. It was MADDENING. I finally lost it one day while she was in class and I was sweating in the house. I went around the entire unit and closed all the vents in her room, and most of the ones in the main rooms as well, so that the cold air from the AC would mainly vent into my room and nowhere else in the house. I know that's also not good for mold in the vents, and felt kinda bad about it, but at that point, we were going to have mold no matter what (the school would not intervene), and I was DONE dealing with someone who had no regard for my health or comfort.

I have zero tolerance for cold.", "75 is \"t-shirt and pants\" weather for me, with a blanket indoors.", "> I think I would ask if they could turn it up at least a couple degrees when people are home tbh. But that's because I get cold easily\n\nYou'd likely even be colder being homeless.  I'd feel I'm putting my friends out hugely by even asking them to house me.  I'd live in a closet if that was all that was available.", "Air blown from a vent is so much worse- typical house in winter is drier than the Sahara", "So this is the 2nd thread I saw today mentioning heat and people having it around 72f, which seems absolutely ridiculous to me.  \nI am in the US with radiator heat. Does the heat type really make a big difference?  In our old house, forced air, I did keep it around 70. In our current house, 66 is the highest and if my room is 65 at night, I will wake up and need the fan.", "I'm with you. One of the least comfortable summers of my life was when my MIL stayed with us because she broke her wrist and I was laid off at the time so I could stay home and help her. We had the thermostat around 72. She sat on the couch wrapped in a comforter, and I sprawled on the loveseat wearing shorts and a tank top and trying to keep as much of me from touching the fabric as possible. Sometimes I even grabbed an ice pack or two just so I wasn't totally melting. \n\nI want to move to where it never gets above 65.", "I live in AZ and it's normal for most offices and homes to be set to FREEZING 70 or under.  WTF did you move to AZ?!?\n\nPeople get colds from walking from 110 outside to 70 inside.\n\nKeep it at 80!!!", "wait seriously?!\n\nour house is at 16-17 mostly because we can't afford it any higher, and yeah it's cold but it's fine with a jumper and cosy socks.\n\nthe friend really is a choosey beggar, bloody hell", "Exactly! There\u2019s only so naked a person can get!", "Same. I struggle with heat and cold due to an inability to regulate body temperature so we keep ours at 20C-21C (68-69F) 72F seems way too warm for me.", "It's par for the course of my existence \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f A very kind property manager in another state took pity on me and rented me a double wide shoebox of an apartment once I had a job offer letter with a start date despite my lack of rental history, so it turned around!", "That's impressive hahaha", "I am also a reptile, and sadly live in one of the colder parts of Canada in a drafty old house. Bf bought me an Oodie for Xmas and I've been so warm in it I've actually turned my thermostat down voluntarily for the first time ever. Best purchase ever, I'm usually freezing even in fuzzy pajamas with 2 blankets on, this thing is ridiculously warm.", "Our House is 67 where we normally have the baby. Our room is 64 at night. Our baby has been home for 4 weeks and does fine in a onesie + sleeper+ swaddle.  She spends a good portion of the day on my chest in just the onesie and sleeper and she\u2019s very warm.  Not quite sweating.  \n\nThe dr told us the baby would be fine in a colder house. She said whatever we would wear, add one layer for the baby.  She said that a house being too hot increases risk for SIDS."]}
