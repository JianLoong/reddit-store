She was from the northern US where air conditioning is not a given, but we were living in student housing at our school in Texas where AC is super common (and important, since lots of people die every year in Texas from heat-related issues). She would set the thermostat to 80+ degrees every single friggin' day, and our air conditioner was so old and inefficient that even if I reset it as soon as I got home, it would still be in the upper seventies six hours later, when I was trying to sleep (it was great for my insomnia /s). This went on for a YEAR, despite the clause in our lease which stated that the unit had to have its AC set to at least 75 degrees or cooler at all times  - our school was on a barrier island, and between the heat and the humidity, the school housing would become infested with mold super fast without AC. She never seemed to give AF that she was in violation of our lease, or that I had a heart condition that left me susceptible to overheating, or grasped the notion that she could always put on extra layers, get a heater for her room, etc.... and never mind all the research about optimum sleeping temperatures for human beings. She'd just slam that damn thermostat all the way up every time she walked by it. It was MADDENING. I finally lost it one day while she was in class and I was sweating in the house. I went around the entire unit and closed all the vents in her room, and most of the ones in the main rooms as well, so that the cold air from the AC would mainly vent into my room and nowhere else in the house. I know that's also not good for mold in the vents, and felt kinda bad about it, but at that point, we were going to have mold no matter what (the school would not intervene), and I was DONE dealing with someone who had no regard for my health or comfort.

Jeez 20c is bordering on too warm in a jumper", "American central air is different from the radiators most of us in the UKhave tbh, I don't think it's really possible to compare because air blown out a vent will feel different", "Dude cmon. My home is 74f right now. That\u2019s normal for me", "77 is expensive.", "I would be sweating at 77. We had a day where it was -40 outside this winter and I had to turn the heat up to 70, but otherwise its at 68. Although I do have a gas fireplace in the TV room that doesn't have central heat and I keep that thermostat set to 70 during the day.", "I've dropped my place down 5 degrees since hitting menopause.", "As far as I can tell, this is a myth. She is not your tenant as you've described things; she is a guest. (Rental advice on this site also tends to elide the differences between owner-occupied and non- as well as large v small-time landlords). However ianal.\n\nIt's possible she can force you into a bad position by refusing to leave. But it's unlikely she becomes a tenant rather than a guest, no matter the length of her stay. \n\nhttps://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/how-do-i-get-rid-a-house-guest-who-wont-leave.htm", "I am pretty sure the tenancy thing only applies if she's living in a separate unit, and not in a roommate situation like you're describing, where the place is your primary home. Still, not a bad idea to do a short consult with a lawyer to be sure you've covered all your bases. \n\nOn a separate note, as a fellow cold-temperature-house cat owner, some unsolicited cat advice - cats tend to prefer their environment much warmer (uncomfortably warm for us), so if you haven't got one already, I would highly recommend a heated cat bed (I've got one that is pressure-sensitive, so it only heats when there's a cat in it), and it might even be worth experimenting with cat sweaters. I thought mine would hate it, but my cranky li'l old man cat gets cold quickly, and he digs his sweater!", "I live that way, as well, but I do understand that it leans cold for a *lot* of people. My husband and I compromise by turning the heat on if it gets under 65.", "Touche, but I was speaking from the point of view of a person who lives in an area that has winter :) \n\nI don't know anybody who heats their house above 72 at this time of year. It's expensive and gets *stifling*", "I\u2019m with you, that\u2019s too warm for winter. But I have my house even lower than OP because I both run stupendously hot and love blankets.", "My husband likes it cool and I like it warm during the winter, and we compromise on 66-68 degrees during the day. I wear a shirt and a sweater and I'm totally comfortable. When he goes out for the evening with friends, I turn it up to 70 degrees for the luxury, lol.\n\nI can't imagine keeping it at anything over 72. But since I'm the one who pays the bills, I'm also sensitive to using more gas than necessary.", "I\u2019m always cold and even I consider 75 too warm.  (Barely, I do sometimes turn it up to 74, but I\u2019m paying for it!)  You\u2019re doing her a massive favor letting her stay, AND making it uncomfortably warm for yourself. She\u2019s not entitled to be perfectly comfortable at your expense, literally and figuratively.", "I keep our house at 66, I would sweat to death at 75!", "I have a heart thing that makes me overheat as well. My house is at 63. I hand out fuzzy socks and blanks to everyone. You offered to provide a heater. At 75, you\u2019ll need to get her her own lizard light.", "OP - this is your home. Your sanctuary. The place where you should feel 100% comfortable. This woman (that you have been exceptionally kind to) can put on a sweather. She feels like she deserves to be snug as a bug while you are uncomfortable; she thinks this is somehow her right. She has transitioned from guest to freeloader, and is way too comfortable trying to boss you around in your own space.\n\nIf I were you, I'd look up tenants laws in your area, make sure that she hasn't started getting mail at your home, and have a backup eviction plan just in case. She is obviously super entitled and may try to evoke some tenancy laws.", "I keep mine at 72 during the day and 70 at night in the winter, 78 in summer. I grew up in a warmer area and it starts to get physically painful when it\u2019s too cold or I have on too many heavy layers.", "right. 20 degrees and I'm complaining it's too warm.   \n\n\nIt's currently 26 and I am dying lol", "20C in Canada is adequate and in the UK is more than fine. Have lives in both. This person is being a choosing beggar and completely unreasonable. They need to throw on a sweater! A sweater that most people wouldn\u2019t even need.", "I'm pretty sure the person you're replying to is referencing the energy crisis the UK is currently experiencing. Many can't afford to heat their homes above that", "Hhhyuuup \ud83d\ude05", "I too will enjoy this. Lol 75 is ideal for me but I realize that I\u2019m a reptile with terrible circulation so I keep it at 70 in the house so I don\u2019t hear wave murder the rest of the house.", "I would fight with my work neighbor over the thermostat that controlled both our offices. She complained to someone, \u201cI like the temperature set to normal. Comunque likes it set to Jamaica\u201d", "In my state, anyone who stays in your house and receives mail there is considered to be a tenant and would have to be legally evicted. Also, police here consider such matters to be a civil matter and will not help get the \u201cguest\u201d out, necessitating an eviction.

I keep my house at 72 during the winter (sometimes 74-75 during the day if it\u2019s especially cold).", "74 is 23 degrees, I wouldn't have the heating on that high even without the energy crisis.", "Oh me neither but I'm fairly sure most still consider 17 very cold. Personally I keep my thermostat around 20 through most of the cold seasons. That said, whoever pays the bills has final say imo", "the only time my place was that high in winter was the time I lived on the third floor of an older building that had no individual thermostat.\n\nThe heating was set to keep the basement floor at the legal 21C, and since heat travels.....\n\nDuring the day it wasn't so bad once you got used to it (and learned to wear less layers at home) but every night I would open the windows before going to bed because nope.", "I live in New England - no one I know keeps their houses that warm - especially this year with oil/gas/and electric more than double the cost of last year.\n\nFamily in Florida keeps it warm, but they're in a (sub)tropical region.", "I wouldn't consider 17 cold but then again, I'm a cheap Northerner!"]}
