The song is literally about a girl named Maria that the singer kisses. \n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nI know the reference, I actually love the media you are referring to.\n\nBut names are almost universally not ok to joke about. The exception is if the person invites it by joking about their own name", "YTA\n\nEveryone who has a name that can be related to any possible reference, has heard your \u201cice breaker\u201d a million times.  \n\nJust stop.  At best, it\u2019s awful and awkward and makes everyone uncomfortable.  At worst, it\u2019s offensive and you fully deserve the consequences that come to you.", "YTA  \nEveryone was uncomfortable, especially Maria. And your reference is litterally to a romantic theme....You are lucky you weren't reported to HR. Could've just said \"Maria, I like that  name\" to break the ice, like a normal introduction.", "Yta a bit. It\u2019s just not a great idea and yes, you were lucky. That could easily be felt as a creepy come on rather than an awkward joke.", "So I think what you're asking is, \"How do you solve a problem like Maria?\".", "I mean, you dropped a line from a song that is all about how in love with Maria the singer is, and it\u2019s pretty damn clear what the quote is about.  Interpreting it as flirting is logical.  Bad choice of ice breaker.  Sorry, YTA", "YTA\n\nEvery Maria in the world has heard lyrics  from West Side Story & cringes and you don't quote love songs in the office to someone you just met.", "YTA. They are telling you they didn\u2019t like it. Why ask here? \nIf you make a joke and people don\u2019t get it , then you have to be quick to explain it. \nBut in general with names they\u2019ve either heard it a million times already or they don\u2019t want to hear it.

You just met someone and made an obscure reference that you meant to be a joke at their expense.  \n\nThe only person you embarrassed was yourself.  \n\nYTA.  Why would you make a joke about someone's name when you literally just met them?   And at work.  Weird.  She was probably uncomfortable watching you embarrass yourself but I don't think it's HR worthy.", "As a Maria, I can tell you that she's so very sick and tired of that", "INFO: It seems clear that Maria didn\u2019t get the joke.

Not dated, but weird. Even in that songs era it would have been weird.

You weren't really joking about her name, at worst it was a very basic and well-known Dad joke. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  I am old so I got it.   Actually liked it.  I think it was a little out of place but nice.  \n\nJust apologize this shouldn\u2019t be a big deal IMO.", "Tell people to mind their own business. \n\nNTA", "YTA. I have no idea what you quoted, if it was a quote. You sounded insane. And you sounded like you were making a pass at her.", "NTA -  but joking at all in the office is dumb. People are stuck up and tired. They don't want to hear it. \n\nAnd yes, you're lucky they didn't turn that into sexual harassment or something ridiculous like that. Just play the fake ass kissing game and stop trying to make friends where you work.", "YTA. Be professional at work. Wait to make jokes etc when you actually know someone. Don't do it right when they've been hired and you're meeting them for the first time. Weird? Yes. Inappropriate? Yes.", "NTA. Too minor to care about that. Not every joke works, that\u2019s life", "NTA? I didn\u2019t get the reference either but it\u2019s just a silly joke that didn\u2019t land, nothing offensive. People need to chill, not everything needs to be reported to HR", "Just to be clear, I wasn't singing. All I did was say the line. But I guess it didn't matter anyway.", "I have a name that appears in quite a few songs, tbh I'm not going to dwell on it or get offended if someone uses one of those lines.

But OP will never learn\u2026", "How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?", "Honestly, I wasn't thinking so much about the love context of the song, it was just that particular line that stood out to me when I heard it. But yeah, you're right. I should be more careful about my words from now on.", "I did tell them the name of where the line came from, but nothing was made of it after and people just moved on with introductions.", "Uh yeah, from one of the most romantic and erotically charged (in all directions) musicals of all time", "Ugly comment", "Don't know why your getting DV, it is a much better line and works so good in this situation.", "At work? No, people should speak up if something has unclear communication. OP thinks they quotes a musical and the other people think they are flirting. It is ok to try and clear it up.", "If you HAD to pick a song, you couldn\u2019t have gone with the completely unromantic \u201cHow do you solve a problem like Maria\u201d?", "Making fun of someone's name is, best case, high risk low reward.\n\nExtremely unwise. Ask yourself why anyone would welcome someone making fun of their name?\n\nDo yourself a favor - learn a lesson and don't do it again.", "You're an incompetent moron", "If he sang that he should have been reported to HR out of principle", "Well, NTA.

We all have our own personalities. Sometimes a joke or reference doesn't hit the mark. But He DID NOT say something vulgar.", "To be honest, I didn't think the line was particularly insulting. In my head, it sounded positive, and I thought that everyone, including her, would be able to laugh. But you're right, in retrospect it wasn't a good idea, and I'll have to do better from now on.", "IMO, it\u2019s a good line because you can change the sentence slightly while keeping the reference. \u201cHow do you solve a problem, like Maria?\u201d Ie. Maria solves problems really well, so how do I do it like her? It\u2019s all in how you say it!", "Her favourite bit was \"A CLOWN!\" lol, but it was fine, we had a good relationship."]}
