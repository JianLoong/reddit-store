I'm confident I'm NTA, but I need some support from others on this.\n\nMy family lives about 1000 miles away and the last Christmas I had with them was in 2004. We live 2 1/2 hours from my husband's family and every year but for maybe 3 of those years (one of which was due to Covid) we have had to wake up early, rush through our Xmas morning, pack the kids up to get in the car to be there by noon. Not fun.\n\nOver the years I have said that once in a while I wanted to stay home and let our kids stay in their pjs and enjoy their toys over a leisurely day.  Each time he turned me down, saying \"but it's my family\" and that he wants to spend it with them. The last time he said it felt like a punch in the gut to me, a humiliating realization about where I fell in the hierarchy and how little my feelings mattered on the subject.\n\nHe puts virtually no effort into Xmas. Ten minutes to pick a tree seems reasonable to him and he has no issue with coming home with trees with gaping holes, which means you can't decorate it properly. (It's not like grabbing a loaf of bread where any one will do.) He sticks it in the tree stand and that's it. Only ***once*** has he hung the lights on the fresh tree *he* insists we get each year and far too often often he leaves the house to go get a beer while the kids and I decorate it. He claims he leaves because I make decorating the tree tense. I know was tense a few times, for sure, but I'd contend that having to shoulder 90% of the preparation of Xmas down to putting the lights on the tree every year, might do that to a person. I must also add that both he and my son have their birthdays within 2 weeks of Xmas so it's a lot to plan and yes, sometimes I feel tense.\n\nAfter last Xmas I intended to take a stand and stay home alone this year. Ironically, his sister and niece each felt the same way (about not wanting to rush the morning) and they spoke up about it. So this year things will change and we are doing the extended family Xmas the week before so we can all stay at our respective homes on Xmas day. So while I am getting Xmas at home this year, the **ONLY** reason is because it's what someone else wanted it that way, NOT because my husband compromised.\n\nHe can't/won't/refuses to see that choosing his family over me every year is a problem. He doesn't understand that it sends a very hurtful message to me, especially given I haven't had a Xmas with mine since 2004. He believes that a compromise would have been celebrating our family Xmas on a different day and going to his family on the actual holiday.  That is not a compromise. That is still making me alter my desires while he gets exactly what he wants.\n\nSo, AITA for having wanted a family Xmas at home, with just the four of us from time to time over the last 18 years?\n\nEDIT: To clarify, my kids are teens now so staying at home with toys isn't the issue, though it had been for years.

It's time for him to start shouldering some of the responsibilities.", "NTA Tell him to go on his own if he really wants to and you stay at home and have a nice Christmas with the kids.

We had family in 4-5 different directions, all 2-3 hours away.  I hauled my kids for Christmas once and said \u201cnever again\u201d.    \nWe stayed home until the kids moved out.  We woke up, opened gifts, made brunch, then had a quiet day at home.", "NTA. \n\nIf the decorating is stressful to him, he can at least pick a better tree and participate in other preparation activities.\n\nHe has a family, you have a family and you both have a family with your kids. The holiday plans should be fair. The same holiday being spent with your husband's family for 18 years doesn't sound fair.", "Nta", "NTA.  You deserve to celebrate with your kids and enjoy the whole day.  Since husband does so very little, then he can take his little and go to his parents' home alone.", "I'm a firm believer that Christmas should be in the home of the children in a family, as long as their parents are happy to host. Let the grandparents make the drive so that their grandchildren can stay home and enjoy their new gifts, possibly have a nap / down time, and not get carsick.", "NTA. Even 3 or 4 years of what you describe would be too much. 18 years is terrible.\n\nAnd thats before the fact that you haven't been able to do christmas with your extended family in that time.\n\nPlease, do yourself a favor and buy the plane tickets for you and the kids to go home for the holidays. If not this year, next. If he wants to join, fine. But go whether he joins you or not. Or drive even. 1000 miles would be a long days drive, but it could be done. At worst, a day and a half.\n\nMy family does the 600 mile trip to my ILs for the holiday every other year. Never once was there a question that we wouldn't do it that way. Neither family was ever considered more important than the other in this area.", "NTA. He\u2019s taken over and is bulling his way through. A GOOD balance in all of this would have been: 3 homes, 3 year rotation. His parents, your parents, and the marital home. That would have lightened the load and allowed the kids to know all their family, not just his side.", "NTA but seriously, 18 years is a long time to be with someone so selfish.  Nearly everyone I know who is married alternates unless there is a reason not to.  I'm guessing its not just xmas that has to be his way or no way.", "We\u2019ve moved away from family and I gotta be honest it\u2019s nice not to have to go to everyone\u2019s house. Really though NTA if he can\u2019t help he doesn\u2019t get to say where you go", "NTA - I'll thrown in my agreement to much of what is said and add to just buy the prelit artificial tree since HE is the one who wants it but doesn't give a hoot to do it right.", "NTA. I grew up in a family where every single Thanksgiving and Christmas was spent going to see relatives and I absolutely hated it. I just wanted a relaxing day in my pjs with my immediate family and resented having to go and make small talk with relatives. I still dislike winter holidays because of it. You should at least be able to have a relaxing Christmas every other year. Your husband is being really inconsiderate of you and your kids. If he insists on going, he can go alone.", "NTA and it\u2019s not fair to you or your children.  You should not have to do the majority all by yourself and your husband is selfish.", "NTA but way have you not gone to your family Christmas in 18 years?", "NTA \n\nThat's how we grew up.  My mom still talks about her regrets on not putting a stop to it.  I'm in my forties", "NTA but like i think it's time to start looking into a divorce lawyer because he's putting his wants and needs over everyone else's.", "Was he always like this? Why did you make a family with someone who doesn\u2019t even consider you \u2018his family?\u2019", "NTA, this absolutely should be split between \"families\", your, his and the nuclear family at home.", "If I had an award I would give it to you.  Anytime I see a post about people and their selfish partners I always wonder why they are settling for this type of behavior?", "A lot of these spouses put their \u201cbest behavioral mask on until after the marriage. \n\nI also suspect a lot of them don\u2019t want kids, but can\u2019t adult up and say so when they are dating, so they just have the kids and then passive aggressively do nothing to punish the person who wanted them.", "This!  Odd years Christmas at in-laws, even years Christmas with OP's family, leap years Christmas at home alone.", "Wasn't always like this. I came from a family that had little interaction with extended family so I enjoyed his family's closeness. I enjoy spending with time them, that's not the issue. It's just that I want my own traditions.", "Yeah, it's when the mask comes off and they stay and keep having kids that boggles me.", "Leap years are always even. So she would always be sacrificing time with HER family on those years. Why not just a 3 year cycle. His, hers, home.", "I have two kids, that's it. People have issues and this is one of his. He could point to some of mine that would make you call me TA. To make a blanket statement that he doesn't give a F about his family in general, is fairly harsh. But if the direction of your comment is why does someone allow this, it's a complicated answer and one I have unfortunately only come to understand over the last few years.", "And that's why I don't need to understand to know you aren't TA here. A lot of people take so much longer to notice. I'm sorry if I came off like I blame you for him being a jerk. Hang in there OP.", "NTA - Sis, look into airfare for you and the kids to fly back to your family's house for Christmas. If you can't afford it this year, quietly begin planning and saving for next year.\n\nNext September, ask him if he plans to come with you and the kids to your family's house for Christmas. Don't ask. Tell him this is what is happening. Tell him that you are the only person who ever compromises and you are DONE with that. So, you and the children are going. If he wants to go, he needs to let you know immediately as you are purchasing tickets soon. Then, purchase the tickets and take the kids to visit your family.\n\nStop asking. Stop allowing him to rail road you. You are a partner - a partner gets equal say and equal weight. He's had EVERYTHING for years. So, tell him fair is fair, for the next 18 years you guys are doing it your way. Then, start some new traditions. He'll come on board eventually.", "NTA. What kills me is that he talks about \u201cmy family\u201d like he didn\u2019t build his own fecking family with you years and years ago.", "NTA, all I\u2019d want for Christmas is a divorce", "NTA But stop going with him. Wave goodbye and settle in at home with your kids and then ask yourself why you're still married to someone who treats you this way?", "OP, I'm the child from a family like this. We always had to travel to see my dad's family. I barely have memories from the Christmases we traveled for and almost no memories of my mom's family on Christmas. The memories I do have are from the ones I had at home where it was calm and we got to actually experience the holiday.\n\nYou're NTA and I'm sorry you've lost all this time your kids could have had.", "Only an asshole for comparing bread and Christmas tree. Grabbing loafs is not easy lady.", "NTA.\n\nAgree. Few years ago the women in my family pulled a \"if you want to do the big Christmas this year, the men are going to have to get their shit together\". Warned them in October.\n\nFast forward to Christmas day and all but 2 of the male relatives had done nothing. Turned up at the hosts house, opened the beer fridge, no beer. Cue meltdown when they all realised that when we reminded them several times and sent them shopping lists we *meant* it. Best Christmas show ever: watching a bunch of fully grown men blaming each other for ruining Christmas after being stared down by Granny.", "Strange family. They make zero effort so I stopped as well. At this point it would be uncomfortable to go.", "Excellent point.   Maybe make it even years in-laws, odd years OP family, leap year Christmas at home, see how long for husband to notice LOL.", "You two need couples counseling.", "You're good. That's a stand up response - I appreciate it. Take care!"]}
