And do you honestly even want someone who can drop you any second?", "NTA.  You need to tell your bf if he dies not stop responding to her, he is out of the delivery room too.  If she say her kids are home alone, you can tell bf to call the cops and report her kids as home alone because anyone that would use their kids as pawns is a terrible parent and should be reported.", "Wait....

Your first mistake was getting pregnant by a guy who already has 4 kids. That right there shows he's irresponsible. Is he even spending time with them or providing for them. You need to cut your losses and run and don't tell anyone but your mom when you go in labor. You need to see how he cares for his other children before you allow him into your child's life.

(If it's a C-section, the hospital only allows 1 support person in the OR, & you get to decide who that will be.) It's also rather private as the actual birth involves a rather personal body area! Except for medical professionals, NO ONE gets to be in there unless the MOM IN LABOR wants them to be there. You need people there that help you feel SAFE, not STRESSED. If you get partway through labor & either support person is stressing you out, like if your bf keeps talking about how his sister \"should\" be there, then you can have him removed at that point.\n\nBe sure to tell the hospital that the sister is NOT allowed into the maternity ward, or any visitors for 24 hours, but be sure to give them her name specifically.
