The fact that you want him there the entire time should be more than enough reason for him to kennel the dog, regardless of whether or not he feels it\u2019s reasonable to keep running back and forth. I delivered at a hospital 5 minutes from home and we still made arrangements for someone to take our dog. I hope he comes to his senses and becomes a more supportive partner, you deserve better than how he\u2019s currently acting.", "NTA. That sounds practical and realistic. There's no \"down time\" when you're emotionally supporting your partner through a highly significant life event, particularly where there's considerable physical danger involved.\n\nMaybe sit him down and ask him how he's going to feel if he misses the birth because he's walking the dog. Great story to tell the kid later, right?\n\nAlso, if things go badly wrong, he may be needed to consent to medical procedures on your behalf. \"So, because I was walking the dog, I wasn't able to consent to the blood transfusions when my wife was hemorrhaging so so now I'm a widowed single dad.\" More great stories to tell the kid! \n\nPracticality!", "So...the weekend before a huge operation that you're bringing new life into, he's going to be gone. When be should be at home with you, caring for you, spending quality time, hoping everything will go smoothly and relaxing at home maybe prepping the house more for the baby and YES scheduling a sitter or pet hotel or something. He's going to leave. For 3 days. For his own wants. While you...sit at home and fret about this pending HUGE LIFE ALTERING THING ...and AND to top it off he's going to leave during the ACTUAL birth ...to \"let the dog out\" when he could ask a friend. Or book a pet watcher. \n\nGirl. Sit his ass down and tell him he's not making you or HIS CHILD a priority. Or I'd take someone else who you could rely on more like maybe your mom. Like ..he clearly isn't interested is what it sounds like.", "Since it's a scheduled C-section is he stressing/afraid of what's happening? He really needs to be there for his wife and his child. Other than nervousness, I can't think of any reason why a man would use a dog as an excuse to not be there. \n\nDefinitely NTA and this is a battle I would fight.", "NTA. I don't know if your husband is genuinely a jerk or if he's just a first-time dad who's completely clueless about what delivery and postpartum care (of both you and the newborn) is going to look like - either way, his plan is stupid and bound to cause major stress.

But seriously think about whether you want to stay with him or not, because that would be a deal breaker for me. And I\u2019d be out of that relationship before he got home to the dog", "NTA, as a pregnant woman I read this post to my husband and he was baffled. A c-section has a huge recovery, there\u2019s a lot of limitations and you\u2019re going to need your partner there. Sure there are nurses but he should be bonding with the baby when you need a break, not the nurses.", "LOL sounds like you picked the wrong husband NTA", "NTA. I mean, you are at the bottom of the list. Do you have a friend or family member who can be with you? So you can think hard if this is the kind of person you want to be married to?", "NTA. A c-section and the recovery are not easy at all and him playing it like is not a big deal is  very concerning.", "NTA he's really dropping the ball here.", "NTA. He'd best get his priorities straight. Animal lover here, and he's doing the dog (or you, or your kid, or him) any favors by downplaying the amount of care and work that's coming his way.", "NTA,\n\nHowever you and baby are cutting deep into his \"man\" time. It's not like he'll be the one in labor. He can come and go as he pleases. Plus he doesn't need to do all that baby stuff. It's not like he'll be doing it at home. Cut the poor guy some slack.

You won't be able to walk to the bathroom at a pace faster than a snail. You won't be able to reach into a bassinet and pick up a baby from a laying down position, or return the baby to the bassinet. The nurses don't just hover outside your door waiting for you to call them. If you need something and the nurses are busy, you'll have to wait. You are NTA but you don't sound prepared for c section recovery.", "NTA but husband is. I'd be straight up telling him he'd better straighten up because if he's not going to be there for you, what do you even need him for?", "NTA but this may be indicative of your relationship going forward, so be mindful of that.", "NTA\n\nYou're having surgery. You need to balance healing and recovering with keeping a newborn thriving. He's supposed to be a parent and your support system. To downplay it and say that's what the nurses are for, that's lazy.\n\nDepending on how how full the ward is, you may get a lot of personal attention, or bare minimum (meds administered, pediatrician making sure baby is healthy, you midwife or delivering doc making sure you're intact). Definitely not 24/7 care. It's a crap shoot. Things can go south pretty quick for new moms and babies. If someone on the ward codes, they're the ones getting assistance, not you.", "NTA. It\u2019s baffling what your husband chooses to prioritise when you\u2019re about to give birth. The dog not being left at the sitter is not even the start of the problem. I think your husband maybe in denial about how BIG this baby is going to be in your lives. And he DEFINITELY shouldn\u2019t be going to a race or staying away from you when you\u2019re that close to the surgery. A lot of things could go wrong (or right) in the last minute and it\u2019s important he be around till you\u2019re all the way through.", "WTF did I just read? \nBoard the damn dog and so it yourself if you have too--or enlist a friend to help \ud83d\ude09\n\nNTA, good luck with labor/delivery & congratulations on your little one!", "Maybe tell him your OB wants a copy of your birth and postpartum plan for your next appointment. While you sit and draft it up together it\u2019s a good time to discuss. You can find free templates online. Then privately message your OB and have them ask and review it with you both during your next appointment. Hopefully that opens discussion to clear up some misunderstandings or whatever other emotions he may be having. \n\nAlso make sure you have a BFF waiting in the wings in case he flakes on you. I\u2019m sorry this is happening, OP. Best wishes for a safe delivery for you and baby. And that you find someone to remove your husbands head from his ass. \n\nNTA.", "Your idea is a great idea. Can you arrange the dog sitter yourself, or at least have a friend or family member on reserve as a backup?\n\nHas he been joining you at the OB-Gyn, maybe they could talk some sense into him. Or does your doctor use a portal to answer questions so you can explain just how down and out you will be for the first few weeks, and how commuting back and forth to the hospital isn't kind.", "NTA your husband is a real clown though", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2019re undergoing a planned procedure where you can ensure your dogs in capable hands. It sounds like he doesn\u2019t want to be there to be a supportive husband. What you\u2019re feeling is totally valid and he has zero excuse to be acting in this manner.", "NTA. I\u2019d be losing my mind.", "NTA\n\nThe last thing you need to be stressing about when you are having a serious medical procedure is that your husband is going to disappear every five minutes to go play with the damn dog. He can leave the dog with a sitter for a few days. The dog will be fine.", "NTA. You are undergoing surgical procedure and will have a dependent after it too. He would potentially have to look after 2 people once you are out (post-OP can take weeks before you are fully operational again).\n\nTalking from experience, men often are not fathers until the baby is out, whereas women go through the journey as the baby grows inside them. He might be not fully aware of what he signed up for,  and might be in delusion of what it will involve. It might be he is trying to hold on to his normalcy for as long as he can. But he is your husband and the father of your child: he'll have to step up his game quickly enough.", "NTA. You're having a pretty major operation and he's about to be a father. Someone else can take care of the dog for a little while. I feel like that's pretty standard.", "NTA. If there\u2019s ever a time to pay for a convenience, it\u2019s having someone come take care of the dog while you\u2019re in the hospital giving birth to your first baby. First time dads frequently think things are going to be easier than reality.", "I lose my mind at him. NTA what is he even thinking!?! He wants a reason to be able to leave in my opinion and that\u2019s not cool.", "NTA. Heck no he needs to be there and to hell with the dog, if not to the sitter. My goodness.", "NTA.  Your husband is being unrealistic and completely dismissive of you and what you're about to experience.   Sorry and good luck!", "NTA but your husband seems very unprepared for what labor and delivery could/will look like.", "NTA. I hope you have family and friends who can give you the support you need because your husband is clueless.", "Nta o honey, this is not going to get better.  Good luck every getting him to do any childcare.", "NTA. I've had 2 c sections. It's major abdominal surgery. He's being selfish. And is outright saying you and baby are the lowest in his list.", "Nta\nJust tell him to not show up at the hospital and you'll see him when released and you'll have a family member come stay with you Since he doesn't care about helping you or seeing y'alls  baby", "NTA. In fact, your husband is an AH. Almost every first time parent I know is super involved, stoked, planning ahead for everything and even worried about \"what ifs\". Your husband seems to think this baby is just a footnote in his life and that nothing will change, you'll keep doing what you're doing, he'll keep doing what he's doing....holy shit is he in for a rude awakening.   \n\n\nAlso, you can plan a c section but doesn't mean your baby follows timelines. You might have the baby early or later or or or. I would not plan on a race or any getaway with the boys days from the delivery date. Sorry but that shit gets put on hold.   \n\n\nMy biggest fear is that this is foreshadowing what your future looks like.", "I don\u2019t think you request is unreasonable. When I had a C section we did have plenty of time for him to run home to let the dogs out twice a day, shower, etc. Due to the fact that our baby had to stay in the nursery under the heater. I also enjoyed him leaving the room. If I\u2019m honest he got on my nerves. He had the \u201cfirst time parent\u201d jitters. Even once we was home I just wanted to be left alone. It was rather annoying to me to have something waiting on me. I threatened several times to kick him out of our home. My hormones was all over the place. - your request isn\u2019t unreasonable. His side isn\u2019t unreasonable either. Everyone is different when it comes down to things. Find a common place to work it out! All will be fine!\nNTA.", "It\u2019s sounds like racing, dog, downtime and you then new baby, in that order. Are you sure he will come back after taking down time? NTA sounds like he is", "NTA.

Wishing you a safe delivery & only joy in meeting your baby.", "NTA but is there a compromise to be had here? Maybe dog stays at the sitter for the first 48 hours and then he can bring the dog home, hang out for a short bit and then come back. He could even bring a blanket the baby had used to help the dog adjust to the smell of its new human sibling?", "NTA, my husband didn't even have time to go to our house, which is 5-10 minutes away from the hospital btw, for either pregnancy. I had severe tearing for both babies, and he was there to help me walk to the bathroom and take care of baby when I couldn't. Nurses push you to be independent a few hours after birth and push your spouse to help spot you. I can't imagine the things you'd have to go through after a c-section. He's being completely unreasonable and it infuriates me that he's choosing a dog over you and the baby.", "NTA but, I\u2019ve had multiple C sections and my husband just came to visit in the evenings. He didn\u2019t stay overnight and actually worked or cared for our other children each day. It might be different depending on where you live, but that\u2019s standard where I\u2019m from. He would probably have plenty of time for the dogs. You might want to board them when you come home though if they tend to jump.

My husband had to leave several times to let her out and feed her, etc after our baby was born.  Granted the hospital was literally three minutes away.  But it was dumb.  But we were first time parents and clueless, so we didn't think the idea all the way through beforehand.  Doh! We got smart with my second child, we boarded her.  Definitely a good idea.", "I can understand that he just thinks he can do it all. But maybe tell him that you want the dog out of the way so *you* are not stressing about it. \nI had an unplanned c-section during a blizzard and my ex took my dog out and she slipped her collar. After a day (a full 24 hours wandering the neighborhood in the snow) one of my sibs had to drive an hour to come look for the dog, find her, and ended up just taking her for a couple of weeks. \nI knew none of this bc no one told me (rightly so) but if I had to do it again I would *absolutely* make sure the dog was out of the equation for a bit.", "We were 20 min from the hospital and still my dad picked up our dog and watched her for the couple of days. Second time around my baby was 5 weeks early so my family rallied to set up the nursery, watch the dog, and the toddler. My husband did pop home a couple times then to reassure our son. There\u2019s no shame in getting free or paid help to make your life easier when baby arrives!", "I didn't want to be doom and gloom :/ but I think that's already her life but possibly didn't see it that clearly until the idea of a child being born and how dissociated he's being has finally hit her.", "He doesn\u2019t think that his life is changing because his wife will handle everything. He will keep living his life as he always has, selfishly.\n\nThat is the impression I get.\nNTA", "Trying to talk about it for the 20th time is what led to my post. I\u2019m at a loss because he shuts down and I feel like I\u2019m being an asshole for pushing the subject. I have no family nearby and friends think \u201cwe got this\u201d because i don\u2019t share these struggles with any of them to protect him. Maybe I\u2019m too demanding? Maybe my way isn\u2019t the only right way. Maybe there will be downtime and he can break away and come home. I\u2019m second guessing myself.", "I don\u2019t even know what to say because this unhinges many of my worst fears. He had a very traumatic upbringing and I keep making excuses for his detachment from important events because his mother doesn\u2019t have an ounce of empathy and never showed any affection toward him. He insists that he\u2019s looking forward to bonding with his child and being the loving parent he didn\u2019t get (his father passed away when he was young). And that\u2019s the basket where all my eggs are in.", "You don't share your struggles \"to protect your husband\"? I'm so sorry to hear that, but it sounds like you already know what your friends' reaction is going to be. Why are you wanting to hear from strangers what you are refusing to hear from your friends?", "Girl, asking your husband to be there for you and your baby in the hours post C-section is *not* \u201ctoo demanding.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to freak you out, but after major abdominal surgery you\u2019re not going to be able to do a lot for yourself, like get your phone from the bedside table or get a glass of water or whatever, and having someone else in the room to help you adjust your pillows without tearing stitches will be necessary.\n\nFurthermore, he should *want* to be there to support both you and the baby, and the fact that he doesn\u2019t is not okay. Maybe he has unaddressed fears that he\u2019s repressing or maybe he\u2019s just an asshole, but it sounds like he\u2019s choosing to use the dog as an intentional way to get out of being there for you during this. You are not being demanding.", "No, this is a situation where you deserve to be slightly more demanding, in that you are having a major surgery to save your life and that of your soon to be born child. You need your husband now more than ever and he is coming up short. The decisions he is making are not the ones that indicate he is committed to you and your child, which is coming at the worst time they possibly could.\n\nI'm furious on your behalf. You have every right to be mad too, along with hurt, disappointed, and sad- all the negative emotions. He is 100% in the wrong.", "You\u2019re not being an asshole at all, he is.  But, prepare yourself because bringing a child into a situation is not going to make things easier, it\u2019s only going to amplify things.  If he\u2019s not concerned with being involved and there for you and his child during the birth and the first hours of the baby\u2019s life, he may not be concerned about feeding, baths, diaper changes, your pain and exhaustion, etc going forward.  Sounds like the start of the all too common dynamic where you do everything and he does absolutely nothing.  You might want to look into therapy or evaluating if you\u2019d be happy living in a situation like that.  Honestly if it were me, I\u2019d then him if he doesn\u2019t want to be with me in the hospital, he and the dog can just stay home together.", "Sadly, he has not been raised with any kind of good example to follow. I think you are right to be concerned because someone doesn't simply become loving and attached because a baby appears on the scene. I suspect he needs some serious counseling. My father said the same thing, that he never wanted to be an abuser the way his father was. He was a carbon copy because he never sought any help to achieve a different outcome. It's a generational cycle that is very hard to break. Please get counseling for yourself. It can give you tools to work with that might help you manage this relationship.", "Has he come to doctors appointments with you where you discuss what the birth will be like? Or have you listened to accounts of what postpartum will be like together? He could just be really clueless and trying to control one part of a vary uncontrollable situation. \n\nMy husband left to feed our cats twice a day and our home is 10 minutes from the hospital. He almost missed the beginning of pushing and watching the baby during some follow up care that I was out of the room for. But he asked each time before he left and we had a backup plan for if him leaving at the moment didn\u2019t work. You guys really just won\u2019t know until the baby comes what it will be like. If you need to phrase it to your husband that you could die and he might be the only parent at the hospital and will NEED to be there, you have my permission to.", "Even with a traumatic upbringing, he should not treat you this way or use his mother as an excuse. He was treated badly, so now he gets to treat you like this. That's bullshit. You need him, he should be there for you. I had two csections, one emergency and one planned. Even when everything went right, the planned csection was still hard to heal from. You need support. Your husband should be the first person that you can rely on to provide that for you. The hardest part after a csection is moving. You will need help to get up, picking up your baby, getting rest when you can. He needs to be by your side."]}
