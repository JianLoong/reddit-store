The fact that you want him there the entire time should be more than enough reason for him to kennel the dog, regardless of whether or not he feels it\u2019s reasonable to keep running back and forth. I delivered at a hospital 5 minutes from home and we still made arrangements for someone to take our dog. I hope he comes to his senses and becomes a more supportive partner, you deserve better than how he\u2019s currently acting.", "NTA. That sounds practical and realistic. There's no \"down time\" when you're emotionally supporting your partner through a highly significant life event, particularly where there's considerable physical danger involved.\n\nMaybe sit him down and ask him how he's going to feel if he misses the birth because he's walking the dog. Great story to tell the kid later, right?\n\nAlso, if things go badly wrong, he may be needed to consent to medical procedures on your behalf. \"So, because I was walking the dog, I wasn't able to consent to the blood transfusions when my wife was hemorrhaging so so now I'm a widowed single dad.\" More great stories to tell the kid! \n\nPracticality!", "So...the weekend before a huge operation that you're bringing new life into, he's going to be gone. When be should be at home with you, caring for you, spending quality time, hoping everything will go smoothly and relaxing at home maybe prepping the house more for the baby and YES scheduling a sitter or pet hotel or something. He's going to leave. For 3 days. For his own wants. While you...sit at home and fret about this pending HUGE LIFE ALTERING THING ...and AND to top it off he's going to leave during the ACTUAL birth ...to \"let the dog out\" when he could ask a friend. Or book a pet watcher. \n\nGirl. Sit his ass down and tell him he's not making you or HIS CHILD a priority. Or I'd take someone else who you could rely on more like maybe your mom. Like ..he clearly isn't interested is what it sounds like.", "Since it's a scheduled C-section is he stressing/afraid of what's happening? He really needs to be there for his wife and his child. Other than nervousness, I can't think of any reason why a man would use a dog as an excuse to not be there. \n\nDefinitely NTA and this is a battle I would fight.", "NTA. I don't know if your husband is genuinely a jerk or if he's just a first-time dad who's completely clueless about what delivery and postpartum care (of both you and the newborn) is going to look like - either way, his plan is stupid and bound to cause major stress.

But seriously think about whether you want to stay with him or not, because that would be a deal breaker for me. And I\u2019d be out of that relationship before he got home to the dog", "NTA, as a pregnant woman I read this post to my husband and he was baffled. A c-section has a huge recovery, there\u2019s a lot of limitations and you\u2019re going to need your partner there. Sure there are nurses but he should be bonding with the baby when you need a break, not the nurses.", "LOL sounds like you picked the wrong husband NTA", "NTA. I mean, you are at the bottom of the list. Do you have a friend or family member who can be with you? So you can think hard if this is the kind of person you want to be married to?", "NTA. A c-section and the recovery are not easy at all and him playing it like is not a big deal is  very concerning.", "NTA he's really dropping the ball here.", "NTA. He'd best get his priorities straight. Animal lover here, and he's doing the dog (or you, or your kid, or him) any favors by downplaying the amount of care and work that's coming his way.", "NTA,\n\nHowever you and baby are cutting deep into his \"man\" time. It's not like he'll be the one in labor. He can come and go as he pleases. Plus he doesn't need to do all that baby stuff. It's not like he'll be doing it at home. Cut the poor guy some slack.

You won't be able to walk to the bathroom at a pace faster than a snail. You won't be able to reach into a bassinet and pick up a baby from a laying down position, or return the baby to the bassinet. The nurses don't just hover outside your door waiting for you to call them. If you need something and the nurses are busy, you'll have to wait. You are NTA but you don't sound prepared for c section recovery.", "NTA but husband is. I'd be straight up telling him he'd better straighten up because if he's not going to be there for you, what do you even need him for?", "NTA but this may be indicative of your relationship going forward, so be mindful of that.", "NTA\n\nYou're having surgery. You need to balance healing and recovering with keeping a newborn thriving. He's supposed to be a parent and your support system. To downplay it and say that's what the nurses are for, that's lazy.\n\nDepending on how how full the ward is, you may get a lot of personal attention, or bare minimum (meds administered, pediatrician making sure baby is healthy, you midwife or delivering doc making sure you're intact). Definitely not 24/7 care. It's a crap shoot. Things can go south pretty quick for new moms and babies. If someone on the ward codes, they're the ones getting assistance, not you.", "NTA. It\u2019s baffling what your husband chooses to prioritise when you\u2019re about to give birth. The dog not being left at the sitter is not even the start of the problem. I think your husband maybe in denial about how BIG this baby is going to be in your lives. And he DEFINITELY shouldn\u2019t be going to a race or staying away from you when you\u2019re that close to the surgery. A lot of things could go wrong (or right) in the last minute and it\u2019s important he be around till you\u2019re all the way through.", "WTF did I just read? \nBoard the damn dog and so it yourself if you have too--or enlist a friend to help \ud83d\ude09\n\nNTA, good luck with labor/delivery & congratulations on your little one!", "Maybe tell him your OB wants a copy of your birth and postpartum plan for your next appointment. While you sit and draft it up together it\u2019s a good time to discuss. You can find free templates online. Then privately message your OB and have them ask and review it with you both during your next appointment. Hopefully that opens discussion to clear up some misunderstandings or whatever other emotions he may be having. \n\nAlso make sure you have a BFF waiting in the wings in case he flakes on you. I\u2019m sorry this is happening, OP. Best wishes for a safe delivery for you and baby. And that you find someone to remove your husbands head from his ass. \n\nNTA.", "Your idea is a great idea. Can you arrange the dog sitter yourself, or at least have a friend or family member on reserve as a backup?\n\nHas he been joining you at the OB-Gyn, maybe they could talk some sense into him. Or does your doctor use a portal to answer questions so you can explain just how down and out you will be for the first few weeks, and how commuting back and forth to the hospital isn't kind.", "NTA your husband is a real clown though", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2019re undergoing a planned procedure where you can ensure your dogs in capable hands. It sounds like he doesn\u2019t want to be there to be a supportive husband. What you\u2019re feeling is totally valid and he has zero excuse to be acting in this manner.", "NTA. I\u2019d be losing my mind.", "NTA\n\nThe last thing you need to be stressing about when you are having a serious medical procedure is that your husband is going to disappear every five minutes to go play with the damn dog. He can leave the dog with a sitter for a few days. The dog will be fine.", "NTA. You are undergoing surgical procedure and will have a dependent after it too. He would potentially have to look after 2 people once you are out (post-OP can take weeks before you are fully operational again).\n\nTalking from experience, men often are not fathers until the baby is out, whereas women go through the journey as the baby grows inside them. He might be not fully aware of what he signed up for,  and might be in delusion of what it will involve. It might be he is trying to hold on to his normalcy for as long as he can. But he is your husband and the father of your child: he'll have to step up his game quickly enough.", "NTA. You're having a pretty major operation and he's about to be a father. Someone else can take care of the dog for a little while. I feel like that's pretty standard.", "NTA. If there\u2019s ever a time to pay for a convenience, it\u2019s having someone come take care of the dog while you\u2019re in the hospital giving birth to your first baby. First time dads frequently think things are going to be easier than reality.", "I lose my mind at him. NTA what is he even thinking!?! He wants a reason to be able to leave in my opinion and that\u2019s not cool.", "NTA. Heck no he needs to be there and to hell with the dog, if not to the sitter. My goodness.", "NTA.  Your husband is being unrealistic and completely dismissive of you and what you're about to experience.   Sorry and good luck!", "NTA but your husband seems very unprepared for what labor and delivery could/will look like.", "NTA. I hope you have family and friends who can give you the support you need because your husband is clueless.", "Nta o honey, this is not going to get better.  Good luck every getting him to do any childcare.", "NTA. I've had 2 c sections. It's major abdominal surgery. He's being selfish. And is outright saying you and baby are the lowest in his list.", "Nta\nJust tell him to not show up at the hospital and you'll see him when released and you'll have a family member come stay with you Since he doesn't care about helping you or seeing y'alls  baby", "NTA. In fact, your husband is an AH. Almost every first time parent I know is super involved, stoked, planning ahead for everything and even worried about \"what ifs\". Your husband seems to think this baby is just a footnote in his life and that nothing will change, you'll keep doing what you're doing, he'll keep doing what he's doing....holy shit is he in for a rude awakening.   \n\n\nAlso, you can plan a c section but doesn't mean your baby follows timelines. You might have the baby early or later or or or. I would not plan on a race or any getaway with the boys days from the delivery date. Sorry but that shit gets put on hold.   \n\n\nMy biggest fear is that this is foreshadowing what your future looks like.", "I don\u2019t think you request is unreasonable. When I had a C section we did have plenty of time for him to run home to let the dogs out twice a day, shower, etc. Due to the fact that our baby had to stay in the nursery under the heater. I also enjoyed him leaving the room. If I\u2019m honest he got on my nerves. He had the \u201cfirst time parent\u201d jitters. Even once we was home I just wanted to be left alone. It was rather annoying to me to have something waiting on me. I threatened several times to kick him out of our home. My hormones was all over the place. - your request isn\u2019t unreasonable. His side isn\u2019t unreasonable either. Everyone is different when it comes down to things. Find a common place to work it out! All will be fine!\nNTA.", "It\u2019s sounds like racing, dog, downtime and you then new baby, in that order. Are you sure he will come back after taking down time? NTA sounds like he is", "NTA.

Wishing you a safe delivery & only joy in meeting your baby.", "NTA but is there a compromise to be had here? Maybe dog stays at the sitter for the first 48 hours and then he can bring the dog home, hang out for a short bit and then come back. He could even bring a blanket the baby had used to help the dog adjust to the smell of its new human sibling?", "NTA, my husband didn't even have time to go to our house, which is 5-10 minutes away from the hospital btw, for either pregnancy. I had severe tearing for both babies, and he was there to help me walk to the bathroom and take care of baby when I couldn't. Nurses push you to be independent a few hours after birth and push your spouse to help spot you. I can't imagine the things you'd have to go through after a c-section. He's being completely unreasonable and it infuriates me that he's choosing a dog over you and the baby.", "NTA but, I\u2019ve had multiple C sections and my husband just came to visit in the evenings. He didn\u2019t stay overnight and actually worked or cared for our other children each day. It might be different depending on where you live, but that\u2019s standard where I\u2019m from. He would probably have plenty of time for the dogs. You might want to board them when you come home though if they tend to jump.

I could barely get my baby out of the bassinet the first three days postpartum after a relatively easy vaginal delivery \u2014 my husband had to lift her to me the entire first 24 hours. Everyone I know who\u2019s had a c section has had to have their partner or support person do pretty much every diaper change (after a few days/weeks many of them were able to have their partner bring baby to mom while she was sitting up in bed so she could change as well) and bring baby to mom for every feeding, as well as help support baby during breastfeeding since mom just had abdominal surgery. \n\nSo say he still decides to go, let\u2019s think a little further about the logistics of this.

If it\u2019s financially and practically possible, ask a family member to fly out, whether for the birth, the early recovery, or both.  \n\nYour husband\u2014and I am so sorry about this\u2014is telling you that you can\u2019t rely on him. Believe him and make any necessary plans.  \n\nI hope he shows up. I hope he gets therapy to help him process his own upbringing. I hope you and he have a wonderful life together. But mostly I hope you find a way to get the support you will absolutely need.", "I think you need to ask him to get therapy.  If he is unable or unwilling to be there for his family, you may need to work on a plan B.", "At this point, someone needs to be with you, period. Either it's your husband, friend, neighbor, or Uber driver, but you need SUPPORT. \n\nSounds like the husband has challenges. If this is the 20th conversation, those challenges are not likely to be solved right now. \n\nTime to take care of YOU.", "Not for nothing, the fact that I was keeping the negative aspects of our marriage from my friends was what made me realize my ex husband was abusive.", "Ok, if he's shutting down and, frankly, not being reasonable about the dog being at a sitter then he's really in denial. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe instead of pushing him, make some arrangements behind his back (I feel like this is an occasion to have a back up plan and it's justified to not see him as a reliable narrator on this) and be ready to hit go when it needs to happen.", "your bar is so low. you deserve better.  you are going into major surgery.  you and your baby need to be protected because your lives are literally on the line.    he can board the dog and be mentally and physically present to support you amd advocate for you.", "i would highly recommend trying to protect yourself and not second guessing yourself\u2026\nI am not sure if you have antenatal classes where you live but basically they suggest ask for help and you need to speak with someone who can physically help you out rather than give you mental support especially after a c section. Just because it\u2019s scheduled doesn\u2019t make it any less difficult for you to recover.\n\nYou do realise your growing a human inside you and any downtime he needs to have can come after the delivery and when the baby and you are settled.", "Read the rules This is not a debate sub, nor an advice sub.", "You deserve so much more. Let me tell you a story. My parents had their first kids young at 18. The pregnancy was unplanned but they decided to give a relationship a chance. The day my mother came home from the hospital, my dad had his parents visit. After a few hours he asked what she was going to make all of them for dinner. She immediately told everyone to leave, my dad included and said no one was allowed to come back unless they treated her with respect. And guess what. My dad grew up. He apologized and realized he would lose the love of his life and his child if he treated her poorly. He tells my family this story to remind us that people can change, but we need the self respect to leave if they don't. No one should stay with a partner who can't respect or support them.", "He sounds like an AH who is not going to stop living his AH life once the baby comes. This is a major procedure and he doesn\u2019t give a shit at all. You deserve better - have a good long hard about how involved he will be after the baby comes. You are NTA - you are being absolutely normal and reasonable", " I'd be straight up telling him he'd better straighten up because if he's not going to be there for you, what do you even need him for?", "My husband helped me through two csections and would happily set him straight. Why is he so against boarding the dog?", "Read the rules This is not a debate sub, nor an advice sub.", "You need your friends and family to advocate for you.", "That's what I was thinking.", "Because you\u2019re unbiased and friends will naturally take sides. I don\u2019t want to paint him in a negative light to our friends, I know many will choose my side but how will that make him feel? I\u2019m not perfect either and I let a lot go by because I\u2019m sure he could complain about me too. This situation just makes me extra sensitive because I\u2019m not used to depending on anyone. For once I\u2019d really like to. Maybe that\u2019s the ugly truth in all this.", "well. sorry. but he doesn\u2019t sound like someone anyone can depend on. you or the baby.", "Dear OP, it sounds like you do a lot of work to make sure you're aware of areas in which you have room to grow and to be understanding toward your SO. This, however, is not the time to back down because you might hurt his feelings. You are about to go through a major medical event with a multi-week recovery process while adding a brand new person to your life. Since you don't have family and friends close by, you need to have him there to support you and advocate for you. Tell a friend what is going on. Get your doctor involved to explain it to him. But you have to stand up for yourself now, because this isn't just about avoiding hurt feelings. This is about the health and safety of you and your baby.", "Was he an \"active\" participant during the pregnancy (e.g did he go to scans, appointments with you?). \n\nIf he did previously around what time did his behavior change?", "People still die during childbirth. You need your friends and family to advocate for you. Call your mom, so that she will be there for you.", "Does he have any male friends he respects who are fathers and might be able to give him a gentle but forceful Come-To-Jesus talk here?", "Can one of these friends take the dog? I also struggle to let people help but now is the time to let them", "It's great that OP is willing to do the work and not assume that she's right. However, I'm getting the impression that her husband is not putting in the same effort to grow, and that's a big problem. Especially with another human on the way."]}
