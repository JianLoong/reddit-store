The fact that you want him there the entire time should be more than enough reason for him to kennel the dog, regardless of whether or not he feels it\u2019s reasonable to keep running back and forth. I delivered at a hospital 5 minutes from home and we still made arrangements for someone to take our dog. I hope he comes to his senses and becomes a more supportive partner, you deserve better than how he\u2019s currently acting.", "NTA. That sounds practical and realistic. There's no \"down time\" when you're emotionally supporting your partner through a highly significant life event, particularly where there's considerable physical danger involved.\n\nMaybe sit him down and ask him how he's going to feel if he misses the birth because he's walking the dog. Great story to tell the kid later, right?\n\nAlso, if things go badly wrong, he may be needed to consent to medical procedures on your behalf. \"So, because I was walking the dog, I wasn't able to consent to the blood transfusions when my wife was hemorrhaging so now I'm a widowed single dad.\" More great stories to tell the kid! \n\nPracticality!", "So...the weekend before a huge operation that you're bringing new life into, he's going to be gone.

He's going to leave. For 3 days. For his own wants. While you...sit at home and fret about this pending HUGE LIFE ALTERING THING ...and AND to top it off he's going to leave during the ACTUAL birth ...to \"let the dog out\" when he could ask a friend. Or book a pet watcher. \n\nGirl. Sit his ass down and tell him he's not making you or HIS CHILD a priority. Or I'd take someone else who you could rely on more like maybe your mom. Like ..he clearly isn't interested is what it sounds like.", "Since it's a scheduled C-section is he stressing/afraid of what's happening? He really needs to be there for his wife and his child. Other than nervousness, I can't think of any reason why a man would use a dog as an excuse to not be there. \n\nDefinitely NTA and this is a battle I would fight.", "NTA. I don't know if your husband is genuinely a jerk or if he's just a first-time dad who's completely clueless about what delivery and postpartum care (of both you and the newborn) is going to look like - either way, his plan is stupid and bound to cause major stress.

But seriously think about whether you want to stay with him or not, because that would be a deal breaker for me. And I\u2019d be out of that relationship before he got home to the dog", "NTA, as a pregnant woman I read this post to my husband and he was baffled. A c-section has a huge recovery, there\u2019s a lot of limitations and you\u2019re going to need your partner there.

The nurses don't just hover outside your door waiting for you to call them. If you need something and the nurses are busy, you'll have to wait. You are NTA but you don't sound prepared for c section recovery.", "NTA but husband is. I'd be straight up telling him he'd better straighten up because if he's not going to be there for you, what do you even need him for?", "NTA but this may be indicative of your relationship going forward, so be mindful of that.", "NTA\n\nYou're having surgery. You need to balance healing and recovering with keeping a newborn thriving. He's supposed to be a parent and your support system. To downplay it and say that's what the nurses are for, that's lazy.\n\nDepending on how how full the ward is, you may get a lot of personal attention, or bare minimum (meds administered, pediatrician making sure baby is healthy, you midwife or delivering doc making sure you're intact). Definitely not 24/7 care. It's a crap shoot. Things can go south pretty quick for new moms and babies. If someone on the ward codes, they're the ones getting assistance, not you.", "NTA. It\u2019s baffling what your husband chooses to prioritise when you\u2019re about to give birth. The dog not being left at the sitter is not even the start of the problem. I think your husband maybe in denial about how BIG this baby is going to be in your lives. And he DEFINITELY shouldn\u2019t be going to a race or staying away from you when you\u2019re that close to the surgery. A lot of things could go wrong (or right) in the last minute and it\u2019s important he be around till you\u2019re all the way through.", "WTF did I just read? \nBoard the damn dog and so it yourself if you have too--or enlist a friend to help \ud83d\ude09\n\nNTA, good luck with labor/delivery & congratulations on your little one!", "Maybe tell him your OB wants a copy of your birth and postpartum plan for your next appointment. While you sit and draft it up together it\u2019s a good time to discuss. You can find free templates online. Then privately message your OB and have them ask and review it with you both during your next appointment. Hopefully that opens discussion to clear up some misunderstandings or whatever other emotions he may be having. \n\nAlso make sure you have a BFF waiting in the wings in case he flakes on you. I\u2019m sorry this is happening, OP. Best wishes for a safe delivery for you and baby. And that you find someone to remove your husbands head from his ass. \n\nNTA.", "Your idea is a great idea. Can you arrange the dog sitter yourself, or at least have a friend or family member on reserve as a backup?\n\nHas he been joining you at the OB-Gyn, maybe they could talk some sense into him. Or does your doctor use a portal to answer questions so you can explain just how down and out you will be for the first few weeks, and how commuting back and forth to the hospital isn't kind.", "NTA your husband is a real clown though", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2019re undergoing a planned procedure where you can ensure your dogs in capable hands. It sounds like he doesn\u2019t want to be there to be a supportive husband. What you\u2019re feeling is totally valid and he has zero excuse to be acting in this manner.", "NTA. I\u2019d be losing my mind.", "NTA\n\nThe last thing you need to be stressing about when you are having a serious medical procedure is that your husband is going to disappear every five minutes to go play with the damn dog. He can leave the dog with a sitter for a few days. The dog will be fine.", "NTA. You are undergoing surgical procedure and will have a dependent after it too. He would potentially have to look after 2 people once you are out (post-OP can take weeks before you are fully operational again).\n\nTalking from experience, men often are not fathers until the baby is out, whereas women go through the journey as the baby grows inside them. He might be not fully aware of what he signed up for,  and might be in delusion of what it will involve. It might be he is trying to hold on to his normalcy for as long as he can. But he is your husband and the father of your child: he'll have to step up his game quickly enough.", "NTA. You're having a pretty major operation and he's about to be a father. Someone else can take care of the dog for a little while. I feel like that's pretty standard.", "NTA. If there\u2019s ever a time to pay for a convenience, it\u2019s having someone come take care of the dog while you\u2019re in the hospital giving birth to your first baby. First time dads frequently think things are going to be easier than reality.", "I lose my mind at him. NTA what is he even thinking!?! He wants a reason to be able to leave in my opinion and that\u2019s not cool.", "NTA. Heck no he needs to be there and to hell with the dog, if not to the sitter. My goodness.", "NTA.  Your husband is being unrealistic and completely dismissive of you and what you're about to experience.   Sorry and good luck!", "NTA but your husband seems very unprepared for what labor and delivery could/will look like.", "NTA. I hope you have family and friends who can give you the support you need because your husband is clueless.", "Nta o honey, this is not going to get better.  Good luck every getting him to do any childcare.", "NTA. I've had 2 c sections. It's major abdominal surgery. He's being selfish. And is outright saying you and baby are the lowest in his list.", "Nta\nJust tell him to not show up at the hospital and you'll see him when released and you'll have a family member come stay with you Since he doesn't care about helping you or seeing y'alls  baby", "NTA. In fact, your husband is an AH. Almost every first time parent I know is super involved, stoked, planning ahead for everything and even worried about \"what ifs\". Your husband seems to think this baby is just a footnote in his life and that nothing will change, you'll keep doing what you're doing, he'll keep doing what he's doing....holy shit is he in for a rude awakening.   \n\n\nAlso, you can plan a c section but doesn't mean your baby follows timelines. You might have the baby early or later or or or. I would not plan on a race or any getaway with the boys days from the delivery date. Sorry but that shit gets put on hold.   \n\n\nMy biggest fear is that this is foreshadowing what your future looks like.", "I don\u2019t think you request is unreasonable. When I had a C section we did have plenty of time for him to run home to let the dogs out twice a day, shower, etc. Due to the fact that our baby had to stay in the nursery under the heater. I also enjoyed him leaving the room. If I\u2019m honest he got on my nerves. He had the \u201cfirst time parent\u201d jitters. Even once we was home I just wanted to be left alone. It was rather annoying to me to have something waiting on me. I threatened several times to kick him out of our home. My hormones was all over the place. - your request isn\u2019t unreasonable. His side isn\u2019t unreasonable either. Everyone is different when it comes down to things. Find a common place to work it out! All will be fine!\nNTA.", "It\u2019s sounds like racing, dog, downtime and you then new baby, in that order. Are you sure he will come back after taking down time? NTA sounds like he is", "NTA.

I had severe tearing for both babies, and he was there to help me walk to the bathroom and take care of baby when I couldn't. Nurses push you to be independent a few hours after birth and push your spouse to help spot you. I can't imagine the things you'd have to go through after a c-section. He's being completely unreasonable and it infuriates me that he's choosing a dog over you and the baby.", "NTA but, I\u2019ve had multiple C sections and my husband just came to visit in the evenings. He didn\u2019t stay overnight and actually worked or cared for our other children each day. It might be different depending on where you live, but that\u2019s standard where I\u2019m from. He would probably have plenty of time for the dogs. You might want to board them when you come home though if they tend to jump.

I could barely get my baby out of the bassinet the first three days postpartum after a relatively easy vaginal delivery \u2014 my husband had to lift her to me the entire first 24 hours. Everyone I know who\u2019s had a c section has had to have their partner or support person do pretty much every diaper change (after a few days/weeks many of them were able to have their partner bring baby to mom while she was sitting up in bed so she could change as well) and bring baby to mom for every feeding, as well as help support baby during breastfeeding since mom just had abdominal surgery. \n\nSo say he still decides to go, let\u2019s think a little further about the logistics of this.

But I understand why you would feel that way when talking about a SO treating you very badly, and you choosing to stay. \n\nNTA, take care of you.", "If he doesn't want people to view him in a negative light, perhaps he should stop doing selfish, shitty, negative things", "Well, this stranger agrees with the comments above that he's not taking the c-section and birth of his child seriously. It also feels uncaring. Why does he care more about walking the dog than being with you during this incredibly important and somewhat dangerous time? When you told him what you needed, why did he refuse to do it? If my partner did this, I would think I wasn't a priority to them.\n\nI would speak to a counselor or therapist if you can't go to friends and family. Also, best wishes for a safe and happy delivery and recovery!\n\nEta: no one is perfect in a relationship. You are still allowed to have feelings and needs. To me, it makes perfect sense that you need him there. I can't imagine going through a c-section or vaginal delivery without my partner. What does he need here? To hang with the dog? It's clear to me that your need should take priority here.", "Op I really don't mean to sound rude, but we're not stupid. You're trying your best to defend him, but we hear how beaten down and burnt out you sound; how you're so eager to second guess and beat yourself up and be an eternal doormat.\nHis behaviour is not acceptable. I understand he had a rough childhood, and I acknowledge he needs help, but your baby is the priority now. A baby is completely helpless and dependent on its guardians. Your baby needs more care than he does.\nHe is the one who is being selfish and self centred. He needs to be a parent right now, and he's not acting like it.\nStop making excuses. For the sake of your baby, please stop coddling him. You are gonna need all the help you can get bringing a new human into the world.\nStop pretending \"you got this\". EVERYONE needs help with their children. I know it's awkward to ask friends for help, but your baby is more important than your pride", "YTAH.", "NTA! He really needs to get his shit together. Do they have Daddy Bootcamp classes in your area? It's a program created by hetero men for hetero men to encourage nurturing and present parenting. He might be feeling a little incompetent that he can't save you or feed the baby or anything if he's not practiced in holding babies, changing babies, and so on. But he can still walk the dog, so that's what he's gonna do. \n\n All the men in my friend group went when we were busy making babies and they all emerged transformed. But the intention has to be there first of course, but then you just add some skills and tada! He doesn't feel defensive and useless and maybe isn't so scared to be there. \n\nMy mom tells a story of how my dad had never held a baby before I was born and refused to until she threw me at him basically and I grew up with the most nurturing involved dad ever... But he needed a stiff kick in the pants to get there.", "NTA but clearly your partner is the main problem. I feel bad for you that you\u2019re having a child with this man so seems so uncaring about you and his kid", "Is he maybe scared? Some people tend to downplay big events and to not fall into panic. \n\n\n\nHe might be scared something will happen to you and the responsiblity of becomming a father. \n\n\n\nI personally would stop argueing with him. Put your dog at a sitter yourself. Tell him he needs to be there, because you want him there.", "NTA but your husband needs a reality check about responsibilities.", "NTA - he isn't taking this seriously at all and you are right to be concerned.  \n\nHe is less interested in making sure you survive this trauma or in parenting because he plans for somebody else to do everything.  He has said so.  Only if there is nobody there to keep the child alive will he participate.  If a life / death decisions needs to be made and he isn't there, won't your parents take care of it!\n\nThe good news is that when the child can walk / talk, is out of nappies, he will take an interest in the child.  No doubt he plans to still go to race weekends but then he will brag about the child that you raised without him.", "OP, I know in these posts we're only getting a snapshot of your life, but this snapshot is UGLY. It honestly doesn't really matter if he's acting this way out of fear or cruelty or indifference, the point is he's acting this way. Abandoning you at a critical point in your life and making you feel like it's somehow your fault or something you just have to accept.\n\nYou shouldn't have to live like this. PLEASE reach out to people who care about you. Find alternate convalescent arrangements that don't involve being near your husband at all. \n\nAnd keep posting if you feel like you need outside perspectives.

You should have him watch a birthing video, then ask him if that were him, would he want all the help around he could get?", "NTA, it sounds like he is being pretty thoughtless and probably quite ignorant of how demanding childbirth is. I think he will catch on pretty quickly once the baby is born but in the meantime are there any child education classes offered in your local area, especially for new dads? Are there any other dads in your social circle he can talk to who can set him straight? You might also mention this to your Dr and the next time you both come in for a Dr appointment your Dr can make it clear what you need to do to prepare for the birth and what his role and responsibilities should be.", "NTA... but \"first feeding, diaper change\" :-D ... are you serious? Men don\u00b4t care about this... And honestly, after c section, you will be happy you can go pee and you won\u00b4t care who is or isn\u00b4t there with you...", "NTA\u2014typical for a man to disregard a woman thinking of every case scenario and coming up with a plan only for them to know better without considering any of it", "NTA at all. I was actually in a similar situation with my C-Section last fall and our 2 75+lbs dogs. Only difference was we were a 3 minute drive away. My husband ONLY went home after double checking with both me and the nurses. And after I gave birth he traded off with a friend of ours because I was in the hospital for 4 days 3 nights. Unless there\u2019s something going on that you\u2019re unaware of, your husband should be making alternative plans for your dog.", "NTA. The likelihood is you'll be the one taking care of baby (not the nurses) despite having undergone fairly significant surgery - it boggles my mind that hospitals expect one PT to care for another & so few give the mother the chance to recover or rest*.\n\nYour husband needs quite the 'meeting without biscuits' while someone explains, in words short enough that he'll understand, just how much of a life changing event this is.\n\nAgain, NTA.\n\n*For those who it worked out fine, great! I'm happy for you. I just wish more hospitals would let parents have a choice.", "NTA you are having a high risk birth. He needs to be there not only to support you, but to potentially make medical decisions for your baby if something goes wrong and you can\u2019t. Giving birth without foreseen complications is a major medical event. And women who have traumatic births are at higher risk for postpartum depression. Him not being there and stressing you out or feeling alone and afraid could contribute to that risk.", "My husband and I always had a deal that if I went unconscious, he would always be with the baby and never take his eyes off of the baby. That\u2019s it. A newborn needs a parent 24/7.", "NTA but you should have serious talk with your expectations and his involvement.\n\nAs someone who went through scheduled C-section I depended a lot on my husband specially first few days ( I live in other country than my family, so my mom came day after I came from hospital, where I spent 4 days).\n\nFirst they gave me needle in back , which didn't work on my body so they had to put me to sleep completely, next few days you are hooked on needles , and I got to see my son on third day but not hold because needles in my hand I couldn't enter in NICU. I had pump for milk that I was sending and my husband was there to feed our boy and bond with him. So yes there are nurses in hospital but still since I was hooked on needles my husband stepped in to help for first few days completely because I couldn't. Good luck!", "Tell people. Tell your family and friends. Make sure you have someone that gives a shit about you there during this time.", "I don\u2019t know your family situation but it seems like this is when you tell both parents and ask for backup. He is telling you he won\u2019t be there for you and his new kid.  Ask family members to come and help bc he has already stated he won\u2019t be there. Also I would suggest counseling for you two- you need to get him to understand his days of spending hours and thousands of dollars on hobbies is over.", "I don\u2019t want to freak you out, but you know it\u2019s possible something could go very wrong right? I hope to God this goes smoothly for you, but also imagine if something terrible does happen and he happens to be running home for the dog in that moment and isn\u2019t there to advocate for you? It doesn\u2019t matter really if he \u201chas time\u201d to go home or not because it\u2019s not necessary. If he doesn\u2019t want to pay I am nearly certain one of you have a friend that would be happy to either keep the dog themselves or come check in on the dog for you. I have run in to check in on my neighbors dogs for them in far less important situations than childbirth. You need to stop framing this as YOU being selfish, because you have to be selfish while carrying a baby. This is about your child and your health, your husband is only thinking about himself. If you\u2019re tired of arguing with him about it, I get it. Just make plans around this without him. Give a friend a spare key, ask them if they can check in on your dog when you give birth. Also ask a friend or your mother maybe to come be with you during the birth. You don\u2019t even have to give them the details, you can ask as a favor for you and most people would say yes without question.", "But your baby will not be independent and self-sufficient. You will be in and out from painkillers and recovery. Somebody needs to be there watching your baby at all times advocating for them. Usually the father does this.", "The Internet exists so he has no excuse to remain ignorant. If he spent even half an hour reading or watching videos about it, he would know you aren't exaggerating. I was about to say surely he's heard it from the doctors at your appointments, but I'm gonna take a wild stab in the dark and guess he hasn't attended many, if any. \n\nYou NEED to call in your friends, OP. The baby is coming soon, so deal with that first and your relationship afterwards. He has made it obvious that you can't count on him, so call in the people you CAN count on, otherwise this could turn into a bad experience for you. The recovery period is long and you won't be able to do much and it seems like he doesn't understand that. You will need people who can physically come and do the things you cannot, even lifting the baby will put you at risk of injury in the first few days. What if he thinks your exaggerating about that too? You cannot not be left alone to navigate that. Call your friends, f**k his feelings/reputation.\n\nEta: NTA", "OP, I've been reading all your comments, and you haven't made him believe anything. He's made \\*you\\* believe you're not worth being taken care of. What you need right now is to get a plane ticket, or failing that, a bus ticket, straight back to a family support system. Without mentioning it to your husband. You can leave while he's at his races that people think he's joking about going to, and you know perfectly well that he's going to go to. Do it before you have a baby. It'll be easier.\n\nYou are NTA at \\*all\\*. You do need to protect yourself.", "It is very difficult to suddenly become a loving parent if you haven\u2019t had those role models and struggle to show emotion to people in daily life. It can happen but there are often serious triggers to people with traumatic childhoods when they become parents because they are dealing with things (nappy changing, feeding, cuddling, educating and involving the child, kids tv shows, buying clothes and dressing the kid,etc) which they haven\u2019t had to see since childhood. It can bring up a lot of memories specifically related to their childhood and that can be painful or affect mood or how they interact with their children. I know you can\u2019t force your husband to see a therapist but if he won\u2019t budge on being there during labour, please talk to one of your good friends and let them know what is going on and ask them to be your support at the hospital who stays the entire time. Be honest how you are feeling, be honest that you didn\u2019t mention this before because you didn\u2019t want her to think badly of your husband but that you really need support because he is digging his heels in and doesn\u2019t seem to realise how important abdominal muscles are and how serious a c section is. \n\nYou need support, that\u2019s your first thing to sort out. Whether he stays or not, you need someone on your corner. If you really don\u2019t want to tell friends then may I suggest hiring a doula? This is a person who can help throughout your labour, and before with talking and support, they can be an additional person in the room so husband wouldn\u2019t have to leave/ if he leaves then he can come back in as doula is a medical support person. That would give you someone capable and knowledgeable who is able to give support without making your husband feel shut out and without letting your business be known in your social circle. Focus on yourself right now. Good luck with the baby", "Having given birth twice your husband is TA here. What if something goes wrong and you are unable to make critical decisions for yourself or your baby? Hemorrhaging could result in emergency surgery. Not to mention traumatic births increase the risk for postpartum depression. Feeling abandoned while giving birth sounds truly awful. It\u2019s such a vulnerable situation, and I actually needed my husband to advocate for me during our first birth. We had some unexpected complications. Why not have your OB sit down with both of you and discuss the real risks here?", "u/detectiveapart6347 is a bot", "Plus OP will be unconscious off and on from the procedure and the recovery.

(if you're not conscious)\n\nHe is literally phoning in his duties as husband and father", "It\u2019s not about you being perfect. There are rarely 100% perfect heroes and 100% evil villians in these situations. But the fact is, he IS wrong in this one. If you don\u2019t want to deal with deciding who\u2019s wrong and right I understand that for the time being. But the fact is, he doesn\u2019t seem like a reliable person to count on during birth. I think it\u2019s crucial you either ask a family member to come, or tell one of your friends enough information to be sure someone is there for you during this. You\u2019re about to not only have a baby, but go through a major surgery that can be traumatic. If he\u2019s not going to change his mind on this, you need to make other arrangements. Please please please do not isolate yourself for the sake of his reputation", "If you know your friends who care about you will judge him negatively for how he treats you, how have you twisted that round to believing it\u2019s fine? Why do you care less about how you are treated than your friends do? Feeling the need to cover up something that is happening in a relationship is a warning sign that you *know* something is wrong here. \n\nWhy does how he feels about being judged for mistreating you take first place over how you feel about how you are being treated? If someone hurts you, why is it more important to stop them being sad about having hurt you than it is for them to stop hurting you and try to make you feel better? If his behaviour would make others see him in a bad light then *he* should be the one running around ashamed to talk about it, and *he* should be the one trying to make sure you don\u2019t feel hurt about what he did. Not the other way round.\n\nI\u2019ve mentioned shame and honestly I\u2019m wondering if part of the issue here isn\u2019t that you\u2019re ashamed to tell people who love you how things actually are and that your relationship isn\u2019t as happy as you\u2019ve presented it being. But you really need to push past that right now. You are about to go through something major and you need someone on your team, who will be there just for you. Is there a best friend or your mother or someone else you could rely on to consistently be there for you through this? Or a few friends who could come on a planned rotation? If so, genuinely, consider telling your husband to either board the dog and come act like a husband and father, or stay home with the dog, you\u2019ll do this solo.
