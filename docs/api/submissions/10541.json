For sure, you are NTA to want one afternoon free!  Reread your post to see that you aren't even asking them to take the kids out the home -- you would be grateful even if they just kept the kids quiet in their room for a few hours once a week.  \n\nFor goodness sake, the parents need to step up and give you and your wife a break once a week.
