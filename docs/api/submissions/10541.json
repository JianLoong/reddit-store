We requested if once a week on one of their days off if in the afternoon if they could take take the kids out for a day, to the park, to the backyard, or keep the kids in the kids room and turn on a movie. We understand the difficulties of keeping young children quiet, we had 3 of them, but we didn\u2019t think asking for one afternoon a week was unreasonable.\n\nMy son got upset and said we expected them to use one of their few days off to take the kids out instead of relaxing. They both work 5 days a week so I told them I understand they are tired, but they are their children. My sons girlfriend said this was an outrageous request and why did we allow them To move in knowing they have small loud children.\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m asking for too much, only one afternoon a week for my wife and i to enjoy our livingroom.", "created_utc": 1676993263, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11861md/aita_for_requesting_one_afternoon_child_free_in/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Wtf\n\nThese people are entitled as fuck. If this is how they respond to a simple request I'd hate to think how they'd respond to you setting a hard boundary or god forbid going on holiday\n\nJesus. NTA. Do yourself and your wife a favour and set some hard boundaries. If they move out, that's on them", "NTA. It sounds like your son and his girlfriend are ungrateful and just using you as free babysitters and a free living area. You don\u2019t sound like an AH with a simple request as can you take care of your kids so I can enjoy some child-free time. Your son  and his gf are complete AHs.", "NTA - In which universe is it outrageous to ask parents to take care of their kids for one afternoon without relying on the living room?", "\"why did we allow them to move in knowing they have small loud children\"\n\nsounds like somebody wants to get kicked out of their home.\n\nyou're not asking for much. they are their kids. they should be giving you a break occasionally. you're doing them a huge favor by letting them live with you, they should be able to do you a small favor once a week.\n\nthey should be spending quality time with their kids anyways.", "NTA\n\nYour son and gf are exploiting you and wife for free babysitting service.", "NTA. You're graciously allowing your grown son and his family to stay in your house and they won't accommodate a simple request? Yikes.\n\nIf I were you it wouldn't have even been a request, but a requirement.", "NTA - you\u2019re asking your son and his girlfriend to do parenting things with their kids during one of their days off. That is not an outrageous request. That\u2019s parenting.", "Nta. Its very reasonable. Just like they want to relax, so do you. Only different is, the children aren't your responsibility.\n\nYou know what? Take a vacation with your wife. Go somewhere nice. What are they gonna do then with the kids?", "NTA.\n\nIs it really so bad to ask your son to spend time parenting his kids for a couple hours a week? \n\nI'm laughing about your son's girlfriend - why did you allow them to move in?  Well, if it's that much of an inconvenience for them, they are free to move out.", "NTA because what? They just want to relax on their days off? When are they actually parenting? At night only? So you and your wife are watching the kids 5 days a week while they work and get them on the weekend, too. NTA tell them you get an afternoon off or they can find somewhere else to live.", "NTA - You raised your kids already. maybe it's time they move out. If they are both working full time, I don't see why they can't afford to live on their own.

He needs a wake up call.", "NTA. One afternoon a week isn't unreasonable at all. It's your house, after all. Having a day or two off from work doesn't mean they get a day off from caring for their children.", "NTA OP, my mom lived with us for a bit but we were/are the main carer of our kids. When our first child was growing up (15-18)  we also make sure that when we need help to watch our second we ask her if she had plans, if she mind to watch her sibling and paid her time. When she said no, we would find alternative but my mom was never the main carer, our kids = our responsibility. My mom got to spend time with her grandkids on her terms and usually at most 2 hours a day. \n\n\nI think it's time for you and your wife to sit your son and his gf down and ask them when are they moving out because they're taking you for granted. Sure, they are working and tired but they're the parents, not you guys.", "NTA. You are giving them far more grace I would. Not an outrageous request at all, that's just parenting.", "NTA.

He\u2019s being a brat, you\u2019re being reasonable.", "NTA\n\nYour request is very reasonable and I don\u2019t get why your DIL is so upset about it.

I'm pregnant with my first and live in my own home and already want this for my future self", "NTA. OMG. You are already housing them and providing free daycare.   I sure hope they pay a good deal in rent, but even so, your home is invaded.  \n\nTell your son, you\u2019re sorry, but yes, most working parents tend to have two days off work per week, and, alas, must SPEND THEM WITH THEIR CHILDREN.\n\nYour DIL called this outrageous?   I cannot wrap my head around her using such a term.   \n\nYou aren\u2019t asking for enough in my opinion.  Just a few hours a week?  Very reasonable request.\n\nMake it 5 days, all day.  Make them send them to daycare, at their expense.   Explain to them that\u2019s the choice here.", "NTA: your son knows that this is not his house and they are technically guests. He might be too comfortable since you are his parents and he himself have resorted back to when he was a child but they are now adults with their own children and they need to understand that you might need a deserved break. \nYou aren\u2019t really asking for much. \n\nI get that they are tired as well, but that\u2019s the reality of being parents, you have to make the sacrifices even when you\u2019re tired.", "NTA - I think it\u2019s a reasonable request, provided it comes with the understanding that sometimes that\u2019s not feasible - sick kid, bad weather, etc. But getting them out into the world once a week will be good for the whole family. I have 2 kids under 4 right now. If we didn\u2019t have weekend outtings I would lose my mind.", "NTA but I\u2019m really feeling even worse for your grandchildren here than you. They just\u2026never go anywhere? Your wife keeps them in the house all week and then their parents also keep them in the house on their days off\u2014they never get to go to any of the extremely normal and borderline necessary places you mentioned? Like\u2026the backyard? That doesn\u2019t sound healthy at all.", "NTA, they either take what they've got or move out. Your request is not unreasonable. They already get free child care for 2, which is very expensive nowadays, so they have to suck it up and be responsible for giving birth and twice at that", "INFO: Are you saying the children never leave the house? They don\u2019t get to go to the park during the week or the petting zoo at the weekend? They don\u2019t go to soft play or on a play date? Your wife never takes them out during the week and their parents never take them any where during the weekend?\n\nPoor kids.", "Do they pay rent and contribute to the household?", "INFO: Do you live in cold country where taking young kids out for half a day is not possible due to the weather?  Does your son pay rent?\n\nIf no to both questions, then NTA.  Your request for one afternoon per week is reasonable.  Apart from your need for a break, it would be good for your son and his family to have some bonding time.\n\nEdited to Add: Somehow I missed that your wife already provides 5 days of free childcare during the day so that you son and his gf can work.  For sure, you are NTA to want one afternoon free!  Reread your post to see that you aren't even asking them to take the kids out the home -- you would be grateful even if they just kept the kids quiet in their room for a few hours once a week.  \n\nFor goodness sake, the parents need to step up and give you and your wife a break once a week.  They are ungrateful AHoles.", ">I can\u2019t even sit in my living room and relax and watch something on tv of my choice.\n\nOK, that's ridiculous. You're 52 and raised kids of your own, yet you can't figure out how to manage a couple of toddlers?  Seriously?\n\nNTA. Your son/DIL shouldn't be coming back at you regardless, but come on.

So it\u2019s not permanent and the is a plan and an end point.", "YTA- you said it yourself. You know what it\u2019s like parenting children.

One day a week is not a lot.

They're doing their son and his partner a favour, presumably saving them a decent amount in rent, and giving their grandchildren a warm and safe place to live. There's no contradiction between wanting to do that for your family, and also wanting a bit of peace and quiet once a week.", "I guess I didn\u2019t read it that way. I read it was the parents are around the kids on their day off and when they\u2019re home off work. The grandparents are absolutely doing a kindness for sure. I didn\u2019t read that the grandmother is sole caregiver on the weekends as well. I just read that the TV is always occupied and the grandfather wants one day a week where the kids are out of the home and the tv is all his. While this is a reasonable request\u2026living with kids is loud and messy and the grandfather should have known this was going to be like this. Like they are two toddlers\u2026.you will literally never get the tv over them\u2026and yes toys EVERYWHERE. In my family that\u2019s standard and expected at least. My two cents I suppose.", " People don't always do things because they have a good heart. We see all the time where some only do good for positive PR or out of guilt. We don't know if they have others they could've stayed with. It's not a ridiculous question."]}
