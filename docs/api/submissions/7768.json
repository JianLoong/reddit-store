The stories that come out of them are wild. I\u2019ve been to over 2 dozen weddings, all had an open bar except for one.

Your daughter thought 2 bottles of wine per table was tacky.\n\nSounds like their frat style party was super classy, though!\n\nAlso interesting how they're married and probably thinking they're real grownups now... but believe mom and dad should pay for the damages that are a direct result of the free-flowing booze they provided.\n\nThis is just mind-blowing.

Budgeting 12 drinks / guest is assuming quite a lot of alcohol and it seems they consumed it all.\n\nYou gave the bride & groom your opinion.  They CHOSE to not accept it and made their own \"adult\" decision.  They reaped the consequences of that decision.  I hope they find the drunken reception to be worth all the wedding gift money they had to use to pay for the damages.", "NTA - But the whole situation is baffling. A super easy solution would have been to pay for the equivalent of 2 drinks a person and then cash bar. Where I am that is pretty standard. She gets an open bar for the early part of the party and only people who want to spend large amounts of money get plastered.", "Lol - NTA.  Opens bars lead to drunk and disorderly, every time.", "Smart dad, dumb kids.", "NTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "NTA, however, all the guests that CAUSED the damage should have to pay for the damages THEY caused. \n\nAnother thing, the venue needs to get in trouble bc it\u2019s THEIR responsibility to make sure guests aren\u2019t OVER-SERVED. For those of you that don\u2019t know, it\u2019s 100% ILLEGAL to serve alcohol to someone that is already intoxicated. Clearly the bartenders didn\u2019t care and just kept serving ppl that were definitely already piss drunk. \n\nI\u2019ve been a bartender for almost 10 years, and I\u2019ve done HUNDREDS of weddings, I get that it\u2019s a wedding and there\u2019s open bar, but when it\u2019s time to cut someone off, you cut them off, and if other people are getting them drinks after you cut them off, it\u2019s your job as a bartender to make management and security aware of what\u2019s going on, so that they can act accordingly. \n\nNO WAY should your daughter have to pay for all those damages alone, she should counter sue the venue for over serving guests (if possible) and also make the guests that caused the damage pay up. \n\nWhat a mess, oof. And btw, just as a bonus, unless you have more money than you know what to do with, don\u2019t do open bars. Leave it open for cocktail hour and maybe a bonus couple of hours, then cash after that. Or set a limit ($2k, $3k, etc) and then cash bar. It\u2019s not being cheap it\u2019s being responsible. Ppl drink less when it\u2019s cash bar and bartenders also make more money bc ppl actually tend to tip when they have to take their wallet out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Did your daughter really buy enough alcohol for 12 drinks per person? Would they really have had that much to drink if it were a service that just provides an open bar, not a bartender serving what the couple bought in advance? If so, you're right, there should be a practical limit on these guests' drinking. But that is not normal. We did the pay per-person, bar brings to booze and serves what they serve model. It cost more like 2 drinks per person and I think that's about what the guidance was if you were buying your own as well. There is an outside chance that they actually drank *more* because she budgeted for and purchased so much alcohol if they did it that way and there was a sense of \"better drink it now, we can't carry it all home.\" If that's the case, you are a bit responsible, but still NTA because it's not your party and not your job to make those plans.", "Your daughter and her new husband sound like pathetically useless children with perpetual chips on their shoulders.  \n\nYou need to walk away from them for a bit, and let them sit in the very logical, easy-to-predict consequences of their stupid decisions.

But you are NTA", "NTA but I don't know where you live that that's your average drunken stupidity.\n\nWe had an open bar, and our friends are pretty damn loose and the worst that happened at our reception was one of my husband's very small friends tried to start a biffo with a beefcake friend and was laughingly escorted out.", "NTA open bars happen at weddings literally all the time and they typically never go this poorly. This is on them and their friends.", "INFO: Did this wedding have bar staff? Or did you just unleash a group of people on a pile of alcohol?\n\nTrained bartenders generally don\u2019t overserve wedding guests.", "ESH\n\nWhat is wrong with your daughter and son-in-law's friends?   What was wrong with the bartenders the venue hired?  You should look into helping your daughter counter-sue the venue for illegally over-serving her guests.  It sounds like the staff tried to run up the bill (or their own tips) by continuing to serve guests who were obviously a few too deep.  That's illegal and unethical and should make them at fault for a lot of the damage.  \n\nI've been to plenty of weddings with open bars.  I've been to Bar Mitzvahs and Sweet 16s and college graduation parties with open bars.  I've been to a charity auction for traveling carnies with an open bar.  I've never seen party end as badly as you described.\n\nWhat you described was obviously not just because of the open bar.  But it sounds like you had reason to suspect this group couldn't handle their liquor.  Is one of the families a biker gang or something?", "INFO: Why wasn't the bartender cutting people off? They aren't supposed to serve people who are visibly drunk.", "This doesn't make sense... I don't recall any wedding I've been to that was anything but open bar, and there was NEVER this kind of drunken madness at any of them. Are these people all alcoholics? Also, you figured the math at 12 drinks per person?! Is that right?!", "YTA - for even thinking YTA.  Come on dude, how willing are you to finance your children's misbehavior and poor decision making?  Perhaps this is part of the reason why they have poor decision making, because they've always been bailed out by you, or at least have always lived with that assumption.  It's very difficult to transition into adulthood when you've always been treated like a child.", "12 drinks per person for a wedding reception?? Wow. I\u2019m going to say ESH. Daughter and husband should have known their friends/family would get up to something like this and limited alcohol. You should have limited your estimate to something more reasonable. Who was the bartender? Did the venue somehow try to protect the bartender in the contract, or did your daughter have to hire her own bartender? I would think the bartender should be held liable for at least some of the costs. Your daughter and her husband should now turn around and sue the bartender if possible.", "NTA.  So, OP's daughter didn't want to look tacky and have a cash bar and insisted on an open bar?  She's just learned the meaning of the old adage - with age comes wisdom.\n\nOP saw this coming and was very wise to keep his name off the contract and to put a hard cap on what he would spend.\n\nOP's daughter and new hubby should get copies of the video's that were taken during this time and either demand the ones that did the damage, pay, or they should sue them.

Good on you for standing your ground.", "NTA. But I would say the guests were questionable people. Only ever been to family weddings and there has always, always been an open bar (big family so been to a fair amount), and this has never happened.

You suggested the sensible route, they, as adults, chose another route. \n\nIf you had insisted on your choice the complaint would have been different (being tacky, which is ridiculous btw), but there still would have been a complaint.\n\nPaying for as much as you did is a HUGE gift and I really feel should be appreciated more.", "NTA. I would never in a million years have expected it to end up like that. I\u2019ve attended many open bar weddings and had one myself. No damage has ever been done at one I\u2019ve been to.

Nah, they chose the open bar, and they can pay for the consequences.", "NTA. Limiting booze at an event isn't tacky and you had the foresight to not have your name on any paperwork. \n\nAny cent you contributed to their wedding was already huge gift. They weren't owed an open bar or the absence of consequences.", "NTA -   \n1. They're adults, they chose to have an open bar, now they pay the price for having a shit-ton of alcoholic 'friends'  \n2. 12 drinks per person? That is really a lot of alcohol.

But 12 drinks per person???????", "NTA, the guests that caused the damages and disturbances should be on the hook for the costs. I come from a pretty rowdy family and I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing. When we have weddings with open bars we usually rent limos so no one drives.

If they had listened to you, they wouldn\u2019t have had the mess they did have and they wouldn\u2019t have needed to use their wedding money to pay for the damages. They are just pissed they couldn\u2019t pass the bill on to you. They are full legal adults. It\u2019s time they start learning there\u2019s consequences for every action. Some how they haven\u2019t learned it yet. Their education started their wedding day that THEY insisted on!", "NTA, and I'm sorry they are placing the blame on you. It's time for them to grow up.", "NTA. Presumably they know the guests well enough to know that this could happen with an open bar.", "They fucked around, found out.   \n\n\nNTA", "NTA. You made suggestions, they ignored you and now have to deal with the consequences of their decisions. Welcome to adulthood daughter and SIL...", "12 drinks per person? No wonder the event went south.  Sounds like inappropriate drunken behavior.  NTA.  You paid what you said, why would you be responsible for damages?", "NTA but I've never heard of open bar causing this much damage. In fact, I don't believe I've ever been to a cash bar wedding, and this was never the result. The real question is, why are your daughters friends such AHs? lolol.", "So wait: you paid for all the things you said you were going to pay for, right? You told your daughter you would foot the bill for the booze, all of this was agreed on in advance.\n\nHer guests got wrecked and she has to pay for the damage, and she feels you should pay for that too? \n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nAnd the guests need to really evaluate their relationship with alcohol\u2026.like what a Shit show! Yikes!", "12 drinks each???? Who are these people???", "Nta it is NOT your role to insist on anything. It was their wedding and they are adults. You do not have responsibility here. (The bartender might though, for over serving).", "NTA\n\nWtf is wrong with their guests? My family has a number of drinkers, but none get close to that behavior, even when extremely inebriated, let alone at a wedding.", "NTA. You\u2019re not responsible for her guests.. If they want to be mad at anyone/ask for help it should come from the guests that behaved irresponsibly.  It\u2019s nice of you to help financially at all in the first place.", "NTA \n\nI mean the entitlement of insisting on an open bar when one isn\u2019t paying for it\u2026\n\nBut yeah, the real AH here is the bartender for over-serving. Open bars don\u2019t mean \u201ctotally unlimited\u201d", "NTA - You made your suggestions and they ignored them. End of story. If they\u2019re old enough to get married, they are old enough to handle the consequences of their actions. They should be thanking you profusely for the money you did give and apologizing for not listening to you.", "Wait\u2026 12 drinks per person?  Holy shit!\n\n12?!  Are you Russian?  English?  In the navy?  Pirates?\n\nI\u2019m surprised no one died!", "12 drinks per person ?  dear god, no wonder people were whacked. nta but your daughter and friends are bloody messes", "12 drinks per person?  12??  12????", "Assuming everyone will have 12 drinks is insanity.  If I was getting free drinks at an open bar, 2 drinks seems like a fair self imposed cap.  12 drinks per person with 200 people is asking for trouble \n\nOP still is t the AH here, but wow", "I\u2019ve learned people who call reasonable things \u201ctacky\u201d, aren\u2019t the most high class and typically don\u2019t know responsible people.", "Yep, I had an open bar too but apparently the people in my life know how to not be ferals. NTA. \n\nGrown ups cover their own bills for the things they want and are grateful for gifts like money from parents for a wedding", "Someone call the zookeeper?", "I agree, I think I was 40 before I ever went to a wedding that didn't have an open bar. Never a problem.", "Yeah over the course of 6 hours or so, if you\u2019re partying at a wedding it\u2019s not that much. 12 drinks every night or every weekend though is into alcoholic territory.", "They should be going after the guests who caused the damage.", "That kinda makes you a good person, dude.\n\nSympathy, empathy, concern for your loved ones... these are good things.\n\nYou dont have to get out your wallet to prove any of this. Time for the ol' tough love. And the older I get, the more I realize just how tough it is to be the one watching their loved one fail. \n\nThis really will probably hurt you more than it will hurt her.", "You shouldn\u2019t. Frankly, you were too generous. I would have paid for 3 drinks per person (so 600 drinks total for the reception) and let them pay for anything above that. That is PLENTY for people to enjoy some libations and have fun without getting wasted. They are grownups and having family help with wedding costs is a privilege not a right. The consequences of their guests misbehavior is on them and I hope that they figure out who the responsible parties are and bill them if they are concerned about the costs", "You sound like a great dad. But you have nothing to feel bad about. It was your daughter's and her husband's choice about the open bar, and the fault of the inebriated fools for not being able to handle their alcohol.", "You can feel bad and not feel wrong. You gave them a choice, and they chose poorly.", "Why? You warned them, now theyll learn", "I understand that you feel bad about it, that doesn\u2019t make you an AH though.", "Totally get that, as a parent... But like... Did your friends trash stuff at your wedding? Mine didn't. Mine wouldn't. We didn't have this discussion because we didn't need to. We danced and laughed and drank (and snuck off to hotel rooms for hookups like adults) and looked at the stars until the wee hours... We had to go out for more wine. And still. \n\nThey know who they invited and need to start making adult decisions around  how they relate to their friends, and how they place limits on risk.", "Why?\n\nIf they are adult enough to get married, then they are adult enough to make adult decisions and face the adult repercussions of their choices.\n\nYou already advised them to have a cash bar, they should know their friend group better than you. They choose which people to invite.\n\nI mean if it was a uncle or family member getting drunk, I feel like thats another situation. Even then, i think the peopel getting drunk should be accountable for their own actions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe, they should get better friends or better yet hold their friends accountable for the damages caused?\n\nNot like anyone was forcing anyone else to drink, right?", "Get over it.  You didn't do anything wrong.  You smartly read the situation and protected yourself and your wife from the liability. \n\nAny declaration that you \"made them use their money\" to do X Y and Z is patently absurd.  \n\nIf anything, already a shrewd person, you should be shrewder with her/them.", "NTA. My parents paid to have an open bar at my wedding. We had a ton of fun and frankly we all drank a decent amount. We even got my MIL doing tequila shots! No one had sex at the hall. No one broke anything. No one trashed anything. 180 guests and no damages. If the bride and groom's friends are so wild they cause several thousand dollars worth of damage, that's on them.", "Nope- she\u2019s a grown woman. Time for her to put on her big girl pants and live with the consequences of her own decisions", "Do Not Feel Bad. They are married, it's their friends that caused the problem, they can fix it.", "Wow. When you estimated 12 drinks a person I thought you were exaggerating. Every wedding I have been to has had an open bar, and nothing remotely like what you described happened.", "You can feel badly about the situation while also acknowledging that you are not to blame. You tried to warn them but they ignored you. I'm baffled as to how they came to the conclusion that this is responsibility to pay for. That's nuts and I'm sorry but it makes your daughter seem entitled and spoiled.", "Feeling badly is natural.  You live your kid.  That said your daughter was quick to decide how you could\nSpend your money, quick to accept responsibility for her devision.  Now she has to step up and use wedding money for ignoring your advice. \n\nShe is an adult. She pushed to do things her way. You let her. You respected her decision as an adult.\n\nShe is angry because daddy is supposed to make sure  she never has a consequence.  She is wrong.\n\nDaddy, you feel bad because you have been protecting her all her life. But you are doing the right thing. She had to grow up some time.  Endure her anger for her own good.  She is an adult now.  Tell her she needs to embrace that.", "No need, friend. Your kid and their spouse just learned their first of many adult lessons!", "INFO: do you come from a family of drunks? I\u2019ve been to tons of parties with unlimited alcohol and no one has yet *trashed the venue*.", "Congrats on feeling bad! They fucked up and paid the price. If you pushed harder maybe they'd be madder at you now but they wouldn't have to shell out all that money. But this is probably a lesson they had to learn.", "You\u2019re too nice. This is why they are stepping over you. They want an open bar to look fancy and boujie in front of their friends. Now they will have to deal with that", "On a positive note you said it only ate into their wedding gifts and not into their savings so just let them understand it\u2019s the cost of making poor decisions and worrying about \u201clooking tacky.\u201d", "I feel like the guests should be the ones feeling bad about it and paying for their own destruction.", "The one who should limit drinking is the *bartender* was there not one?", "They\u2019re kind of assholes for having friends who act like this when drunk. I\u2019ve been to any open bar weddings and none of them involved DUIs, fights, or damage. I\u2019ve been the person to go a bit to hard with the open bar and the worst I did was embarrass myself dancing.\n\nPeople old enough to get married should have friends who know how to act when drunk", "> but I would not say the newly weds are assholes \n\nYes they are. They became assholes when they expected OP to pay for their mistake. According to OP, the newlyweds:\n\n>are calling me an asshole for making them use money they had planned on their honeymoon and setting up their new home.", "I bet they're assholes.\n\nI had an open bar -- $14k worth -- and you know how many people had sex in the coat room, drove drunk, or got in fights?  Zero.  Because I didn't invite assholes.", "There were multiple altercations requiring police intervention. The damages cost several times the cost of 2400 drinks demonstrating this goes well beyond minor, accidental damage and towards intentionally wrecking the place. They're garbage people. Hopefully, OP's kid learned a lesson about being selective with the company they keep.", "Weird. Probably a cultural thing. I've been to a lot of weddings and the only alcohol I've seen at a reception was wine and beer, twice.", "One BOTTLE of liquor for 2 people??? This is insanity.  A 1lt bottle of alcohol has about 34 oz in it.  Even if they were pouring Double shots per drink, that's still 17 drinks per bottle.  That's begging for alcohol poisoning.  I'm surprised the venue hasn't been sued, because they are definitely over serving", "> I wish. My wife and I are past that part of or relationship.\n\n:(", "I want to know why your daughter is holding you accountable for the damages rather than the friends who actually did the damage. Have you always bailed her out in the past?", "Beer and wine only. Stop serving alcohol early. There are a lot of things you can do stop curtail excess drinking.", "Especially when he explicitly said do cash and keep my name off. He knew and basically warned them.", "My thoughts exactly. I would be furious if my friends wrecked my wedding and expected me to pay for it", "YES, this! Why are the newlyweds looking at you to pay for the damages? They should be pursuing the damage-doers in small claims court.", "This!", "I remember in my twenties how for some people off-the-rails behaviour was normal as soon as they got drunk: see a bike that's unattached? Throw it in the canal! Look a lamppost, pee on it! Street is empty? Cycle in the middle of the road hands-free! Walk past a playground? Destroy the see-saws... on and on.\nI quickly avoided those people, and eventually avoided the people who didn't do such things themselves but still insisted we hang with the people that did.\n\nYMMV but in my experience they were sheltered by their parents' money, so to them it was normal.", "> for the damages caused by poor choices that were made by the bride and groom.\n\nI don't think it's fair to call this the bride and grooms fault. The blame lies fully with the person who chose to get behind the wheel drunk", "AFAIK here in Belgium, the bartender that keeps serving drunk guests is also responsible, just like they need to verify they don't serve minors, or serve people who'll pass on the drinks to minors.", "Since it\u2019s a wedding, there\u2019s a decent chance that at least some of the out-of-control drinkers were family members, so it\u2019s hard to say that their association with the couple reflects badly on the couple themselves. \n\nThat said, the couple are assholes for not either a) ensuring that guests could not drink to such excess, or b) being willing to pay for the consequences of providing free, unlimited alcohol to guests who may behave badly while drunk. \n\nI have family members who I know would not be able to handle themselves with access to free, unlimited alcohol. My choice, were I planning a wedding, would have to take that into account. Do I want my family members to attend? If yes, then I have to do something to limit the alcohol available (probably would provide each table with a bottle of wine and a bottle of sparkling juice, then have a cash bar available after dinner, but this is all hypothetical). If I was set on having an open bar, I\u2019d have to either uninvite people (not ideal\u2014one is my sister) or take responsibility for what they do (also not ideal, obviously).", "Exactly. I don't see how OP is \"making them\" do anything. By that logic anyone who isn't bailing them out is \"making them\" pay.", "Considering he figured cost at 12 drinks per person.\n\nI mean.. 12?! That seems like an awful lot of alcohol per person. He definitely knew it'd be a problem and making sure his name wasn't on any contracts was smart as hell.", "I\u2019m not a lawyer but I doubt they\u2019d win a counter-suit for the property damage to the venue.

Most drunk people don\u2019t resort to property damage, and I\u2019m willing to bet the venue has records of similar sized events where a similar amount of alcohol was served and property damage didn\u2019t happen.\n\nCar insurance might make that argument for the car damage done by the DUI in order to recoup what they pay out, but that\u2019s about it.", "It just sounds like a completely made up story to be honest.", "100 bottles of booze is over 1500 STRONG drinks!!!", "Especially the \u201cfriend(?)\u201d that crashed into several cars in the parking lot. I\u2019m sure a lot of the damage came from that.", "I think beer, wine, and cash bar works the best. It gives people the option for liquor, but most people aren\u2019t going to pay when there\u2019s a free option or will at least start with the free stuff.", "Probably because he knew the company his child keeps", "Not having drunken idiots for friends goes a long way as well.", "Yea the limit should have been 5 but with 200 ppl how can you really keep track and they just went nuts and took advantage which is so nuts and rude as hell. Its crazy to me as well.", "I wonder if wifey still thinks he's a dick now he's been proved right", "I'm still a little mad that a coworker I invited to my wedding in 2009 stole some of the liquor. I would have given it to her if she'd asked. Just... don't be a dick, right?", "As far as you know... might it be possible you were the one so drunk you don't remember the inebriated sex with the bartender in the cloak room??\n\n(I'm just kidding, I agree with you this wedding sounds wildly out of control)", "> And 12 drinks a person? We averaged 4-5.\n\nYeah, this. Even with the last open bar I went to I didn't have more than 3 because I felt the rest was just rude since I know they don't pay for what they don't open in this wedding I was at.  And we were there for many hours.", "I balked at 12 drinks/ person too! That's insane!!!", "Right? I\u2019ve been to weddings where people got pretty drunk, And I\u2019ve been drunk at many - but not with damaging property and DUI\u2019s.", "Except that OP calculated 12 drinks per guest for 200 guests, that's not all going to be friends. Seems just as likely this is a family problem.", "Depends on how long people are drinking. I\u2019ve been to weddings where cocktail hour starts at 5, dinner at 6, and the bar/dancing doesn\u2019t end till 11 or midnight.\n\n6+ hours of drinking, not to hard to have a dozen drinks even if people aren\u2019t super heavy drinkers. 2 cocktails for cocktail hour, 2 glasses of wine with dinner, a glass of champagne for toasts, and then it\u2019s < 1.5 drinks an hour the rest of the night. \n\n\nI\u2019ve also been to weddings where plenty of people have dozen drinks in 3 hours. Less reasonable, but still not insane.", "You\u2019re not countersuing for the property damage. You\u2019re doing it for serving obviously inebriated guests. It sounds like this was an absolute shit show of a wedding reception. That doesn\u2019t just happen magically.", "I think thats very reasonable.", "OP absolutely saw this coming. This situation shouldn\u2019t be stereotyped by age or alcohol problems. OP knows exactly who his daughter is and the company she keeps.\n\nThat said, OP\u2019s daughter is an adult and OP isn\u2019t responsible for anyone\u2019s behavior but their own.

The venue can sue the couple for the physical damage to the property. What exactly would the couple be countersuing for? What damages did they incur as a result of the venue? Again, a counter suit is a huge reach. \n\nYou\u2019re correct that a shitshow doesn\u2019t happen magically but it sounds like it\u2019s happened before considering OP didn\u2019t want an open bar and didn\u2019t want their name on any of the venue paperwork at all. Sounds like a pattern of behavior which isn\u2019t the venue\u2019s fault.", "Completely agree, NTA. His daughter is an adult and if she and her friends want to act like that, they can do it on her dime.", "This is kind of a back ground to my comments. I have never been to an open bar wedding that didn\u2019t have extensive plans for how people would transport to and from", "Well thing is I\u2019ve noticed I can put away a lot more drinks at a wedding than on a night out on the town. I\u2019m not sure why but I think it\u2019s because at weddings there\u2019s food throughout the entire drinking period. Whereas a night out, I probably only eat before and after. \nCounting from cocktail hr, to the end of the reception based on me and my family and peers 8-12 sounds right. The bridal party often ends up drunker than guests too since there\u2019s usually drinks served while getting ready, and during photos sometimes. And OP doesn\u2019t say if there was wine service at the tables in addition to the open bar. \n\nIdk that I\u2019ve ever put away 12 drinks at a wedding but it\u2019s always more than a night out and I\u2019ve never been belligerently drunk after one.", "I might drink a little more at a wedding if the reception is longer or if I\u2019m staying in a nearby hotel and can walk or catch a ride with someone. \n\nBut I\u2019d still drink like four, max at a wedding. Three if the reception is shorter and one if I have to drive and can give myself two hours in between drinking and driving home.", "I can out drink any man with whiskey, and I love to have a good time, but 12 drinks made my eyes pop out of my head. 12 per person is way excessive.", "12 drinks per person is a lot. 12 drinks is two full bottles of wine... I was a drinker (been alcohol-free since December 4, which I'm quite happy about) but even at the height of my drinking, if I drank two bottles of wine in an evening I'd be in blackout territory. It's a LOT", "It also depends on what you are drinking, mixed drinks at weddings? Most likely will be watered down. Obviously none mixed drinks will be different, I've also never been to an open bar wedding that has allowed things like shots (granted that could just be a regional thing)"]}
