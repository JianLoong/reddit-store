The stories that come out of them are wild. I\u2019ve been to over 2 dozen weddings, all had an open bar except for one.

Your daughter thought 2 bottles of wine per table was tacky.\n\nSounds like their frat style party was super classy, though!\n\nAlso interesting how they're married and probably thinking they're real grownups now... but believe mom and dad should pay for the damages that are a direct result of the free-flowing booze they provided.\n\nThis is just mind-blowing.

Budgeting 12 drinks / guest is assuming quite a lot of alcohol and it seems they consumed it all.\n\nYou gave the bride & groom your opinion.  They CHOSE to not accept it and made their own \"adult\" decision.  They reaped the consequences of that decision.  I hope they find the drunken reception to be worth all the wedding gift money they had to use to pay for the damages.", "NTA - But the whole situation is baffling. A super easy solution would have been to pay for the equivalent of 2 drinks a person and then cash bar. Where I am that is pretty standard. She gets an open bar for the early part of the party and only people who want to spend large amounts of money get plastered.", "Lol - NTA.  Opens bars lead to drunk and disorderly, every time.", "Smart dad, dumb kids.", "NTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "NTA, however, all the guests that CAUSED the damage should have to pay for the damages THEY caused. \n\nAnother thing, the venue needs to get in trouble bc it\u2019s THEIR responsibility to make sure guests aren\u2019t OVER-SERVED. For those of you that don\u2019t know, it\u2019s 100% ILLEGAL to serve alcohol to someone that is already intoxicated. Clearly the bartenders didn\u2019t care and just kept serving ppl that were definitely already piss drunk. \n\nI\u2019ve been a bartender for almost 10 years, and I\u2019ve done HUNDREDS of weddings, I get that it\u2019s a wedding and there\u2019s open bar, but when it\u2019s time to cut someone off, you cut them off, and if other people are getting them drinks after you cut them off, it\u2019s your job as a bartender to make management and security aware of what\u2019s going on, so that they can act accordingly. \n\nNO WAY should your daughter have to pay for all those damages alone, she should counter sue the venue for over serving guests (if possible) and also make the guests that caused the damage pay up. \n\nWhat a mess, oof. And btw, just as a bonus, unless you have more money than you know what to do with, don\u2019t do open bars. Leave it open for cocktail hour and maybe a bonus couple of hours, then cash after that. Or set a limit ($2k, $3k, etc) and then cash bar. It\u2019s not being cheap it\u2019s being responsible. Ppl drink less when it\u2019s cash bar and bartenders also make more money bc ppl actually tend to tip when they have to take their wallet out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Did your daughter really buy enough alcohol for 12 drinks per person? Would they really have had that much to drink if it were a service that just provides an open bar, not a bartender serving what the couple bought in advance? If so, you're right, there should be a practical limit on these guests' drinking. But that is not normal. We did the pay per-person, bar brings to booze and serves what they serve model. It cost more like 2 drinks per person and I think that's about what the guidance was if you were buying your own as well. There is an outside chance that they actually drank *more* because she budgeted for and purchased so much alcohol if they did it that way and there was a sense of \"better drink it now, we can't carry it all home.\" If that's the case, you are a bit responsible, but still NTA because it's not your party and not your job to make those plans.", "Your daughter and her new husband sound like pathetically useless children with perpetual chips on their shoulders.  \n\nYou need to walk away from them for a bit, and let them sit in the very logical, easy-to-predict consequences of their stupid decisions.

But you are NTA", "NTA but I don't know where you live that that's your average drunken stupidity.\n\nWe had an open bar, and our friends are pretty damn loose and the worst that happened at our reception was one of my husband's very small friends tried to start a biffo with a beefcake friend and was laughingly escorted out.", "NTA open bars happen at weddings literally all the time and they typically never go this poorly. This is on them and their friends.", "INFO: Did this wedding have bar staff? Or did you just unleash a group of people on a pile of alcohol?\n\nTrained bartenders generally don\u2019t overserve wedding guests.", "ESH\n\nWhat is wrong with your daughter and son-in-law's friends?   What was wrong with the bartenders the venue hired?  You should look into helping your daughter counter-sue the venue for illegally over-serving her guests.  It sounds like the staff tried to run up the bill (or their own tips) by continuing to serve guests who were obviously a few too deep.  That's illegal and unethical and should make them at fault for a lot of the damage.  \n\nI've been to plenty of weddings with open bars.  I've been to Bar Mitzvahs and Sweet 16s and college graduation parties with open bars.  I've been to a charity auction for traveling carnies with an open bar.  I've never seen party end as badly as you described.\n\nWhat you described was obviously not just because of the open bar.  But it sounds like you had reason to suspect this group couldn't handle their liquor.  Is one of the families a biker gang or something?", "INFO: Why wasn't the bartender cutting people off? They aren't supposed to serve people who are visibly drunk.", "This doesn't make sense... I don't recall any wedding I've been to that was anything but open bar, and there was NEVER this kind of drunken madness at any of them. Are these people all alcoholics? Also, you figured the math at 12 drinks per person?! Is that right?!", "YTA - for even thinking YTA.  Come on dude, how willing are you to finance your children's misbehavior and poor decision making?  Perhaps this is part of the reason why they have poor decision making, because they've always been bailed out by you, or at least have always lived with that assumption.  It's very difficult to transition into adulthood when you've always been treated like a child.", "12 drinks per person for a wedding reception?? Wow. I\u2019m going to say ESH. Daughter and husband should have known their friends/family would get up to something like this and limited alcohol. You should have limited your estimate to something more reasonable. Who was the bartender? Did the venue somehow try to protect the bartender in the contract, or did your daughter have to hire her own bartender? I would think the bartender should be held liable for at least some of the costs. Your daughter and her husband should now turn around and sue the bartender if possible.", "NTA.  So, OP's daughter didn't want to look tacky and have a cash bar and insisted on an open bar?  She's just learned the meaning of the old adage - with age comes wisdom.\n\nOP saw this coming and was very wise to keep his name off the contract and to put a hard cap on what he would spend.\n\nOP's daughter and new hubby should get copies of the video's that were taken during this time and either demand the ones that did the damage, pay, or they should sue them.

Good on you for standing your ground.", "NTA. But I would say the guests were questionable people. Only ever been to family weddings and there has always, always been an open bar (big family so been to a fair amount), and this has never happened.

You suggested the sensible route, they, as adults, chose another route. \n\nIf you had insisted on your choice the complaint would have been different (being tacky, which is ridiculous btw), but there still would have been a complaint.\n\nPaying for as much as you did is a HUGE gift and I really feel should be appreciated more.", "NTA. I would never in a million years have expected it to end up like that. I\u2019ve attended many open bar weddings and had one myself. No damage has ever been done at one I\u2019ve been to.

Nah, they chose the open bar, and they can pay for the consequences.", "NTA. Limiting booze at an event isn't tacky and you had the foresight to not have your name on any paperwork. \n\nAny cent you contributed to their wedding was already huge gift. They weren't owed an open bar or the absence of consequences.", "NTA -   \n1. They're adults, they chose to have an open bar, now they pay the price for having a shit-ton of alcoholic 'friends'  \n2. 12 drinks per person? That is really a lot of alcohol.

But 12 drinks per person???????", "NTA, the guests that caused the damages and disturbances should be on the hook for the costs. I come from a pretty rowdy family and I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing. When we have weddings with open bars we usually rent limos so no one drives.

I honestly did.  But her mom said that I was making them look bad.  It's why I removed myself from the situation.  The ceremony was beautiful and the pictures were great.  We even got our dance before the shitshow began.", "12 and I'd be passed out on the dancefloor.  Hell well before 12.", "I literally just read a comment on another post about a kid getting drunk and puking on the dance floor at a wedding.  And I have been to weddings that ended up worse than what OP is describing.  Maybe you are just sheltered. I'm not trying to insult you so please do not take it that way.", "I\u2019ve been to a wedding where a guest got drunk and knocked over a light pole in the parking lot. Was at another wedding where a guest drunkenly fell in the bathroom and ripped a sink off the wall. Weddings in the upper Midwest tend to be drunken shit shows", "Um I don't know how to tell you this but that stuff is fairly common.  That's why I didn't want an open bar.", "It was an open bar he just budgeted that much per guest and gave her the money to pay for the bar Im sure he estimated so high to make sure the bar balance was covered. He is NTA wine at the tables was good enough but she wanted it open so now she has to suffer the consequences. Op made the best decision to not be on any contract.", "Just one query, why is the dad the asshole?", "That was the math he did to give the money without having to pay the contract.", "Sarcasm much?", "So he should be responsible for the damage adults did?", "I agree, I think the people who caused the damage should pay for the damage.  I only think the newlyweds are AHs for calling OP an AH for refusing to step in and pay.", "Sounds like they are way overdue to enter adulthood. Your work is done. Put your feet up.", "Nothing wrong for feeling bad for them but it's not your fault nor is it your responsibility. They're adults. So are all the guests who caused the damage. Frankly they should be upset with those guests and even look to be compensated by said guests for the damage.", "You shouldn't - and it was very smart if you to not have your name on any of the contracts.", "Feel bad for the people who's cars were damaged by others drunken carelessness, for the damages caused by poor choices that were made by the bride and groom. Please don't feel bad about the money or how they chose to spend it. They wanted a drunken good time, they got it. \n\nThis is completely on them, not you at all.", "I\u2019ve been to multiple weddings with open bars and none have resulted in DUIs or property damage. There are tons of people in the world with self-control, it\u2019s not your fault that the bride and groom apparently aren\u2019t friends with any of them.", "You feel bad because you're a decent person who cares about their daughter. You'd be a pretty crappy person if you were dancing around saying \"I told you so!\"\n\nBut I am concerned about your daughter's friends. Getting that drunk, trashing the place - it doesn't sound good to me.", "Are they & their guests alcoholics? This is not normal", "You can feel bad for them, but don't feel bad for your choices here.\n\nIMO you did the right thing.", "You have empathy for their situation. The fastest way to be wise and make good decisions is to learn hard lessons.", "Sympathy or pity are normal responses- this was a hard consequence to a bad decision. Hopefully they\u2019ll be more cautious in the future.", "You're allowed to have feelings, but don't act on these particular feelings. They need to start dealing with the consequences of their choices as adults.", "Sounds like they have shit friends who can\u2019t control themselves and should be paying the damages, Nta.", "It\u2019s ok to feel bad knowing your daughters poor choice led to financial pain. But it was still her choice. I have yet to hear of a wedding, or any party, that had an open bar that didn\u2019t end in a drunken disaster. You tried to dissuade them from this choice but they went ahead anyway. The results were regrettably predictable and they had to pay the consequences. That\u2019s part of being an adult. If they\u2019re old enough to be married then they\u2019re old enough to accept responsibility for their decisions. And they need to stop blaming you. They need to blame themselves and their guests (and possibly sue those responsible for the damages if they can pinpoint who did it).", "It's like this, some adults can handle open bars, some cannot. It was their job to recognize if their guests were the type to handle an open bar or not, and obviously their judgement is flawed.\n\nMy brother had an open bar at his wedding. I'd say the majority of us were definitely shitfaced by the end of the night. But their ask was that everyone had a safe way home. So every \"group\" that came arranged safe ride homes with DDs, Ubers, and arranged childcare so they wouldn't have to worry about small children after a night of wedding festivities. Some of us stayed past the wedding and continued drinking while we cleaned up. We got decorations cleaned up, floors swept, chairs stacked and tables cleaned the way the contract said. I catered part of the wedding (I'm a baker), and I even was able to box up left over desserts (giant open dessert table) for the grooms to enjoy on their own, and for guests to take home.", "That's because you haven't cut the strings yet.  It's time", "This.  But it kinda sounds like OP might have had reason to suspect an open bar would be a problem with this particular group.\n\nEven then - why weren't the bartenders more professional?  Even with an open bar, you can't serve obviously intoxicated people!  u/HauntingSinger6280's daughter should look into counter-suing the venue for illegally over-serving her guests.", "Still. It's not OP fault if the guests can't behave", "oh don't, the behaviour of the British abroad is a constant source of embarrassment", "Also I'm wondering how much bank they received as gifts in order to be cover such a high cost with gift money.!", "With the kids out of the house, maybe you can start back up again!", "Beer, wine, soda only can work.  Slows them down at least.", "Why were you so concerned about this party getting out of hand in the first place?  Most open bars don't lead to the problems you described/ seemed to be worried about.", "So 100 bottles. That must have been less? I just do not understand people that see an open bar and decide they must get absolutely smashed. You are a good Dad and it definitely is on your daughter and her husband to pay for damages. Although frankly the car damage seems like it should be on the driver.", "You did right thing 100%. It was their decision to let the wedding turn into a college frat party with irresponsible decision making. You tried to guide them but they didn\u2019t \u201cwant to look cheap\u201d. Their married and adults now they need to think about these types of things", "I fail to see how the aftermath of that reception provided anyone with a positive image of the family.  If your wife believes that any of this is in any way your responsibility, you have much larger concerns.  This perception is so divorced from reality it's way above reddit's pay grade, all this will result in is calls for therapy and divorces, and all the usual.  I will say this, this is NOT normal behavior that is exhibited by normal people, unless you live in the world of celebrity and high-net-worths, in which case it's absolutely normal to just throw money at the problem to make it go way, as nobody is ever going to learn any sort of value life lesson, simply because they don't need to.  You are not perceived as a father, but as an expense account.", "Why did you go ?", "[deleted]", "Yeah, he budgeted 12 drinks per guest, which is astonishingly high. 12 drinks! No one should've been allowed to drive after that.\n\nI'm just amazed at the $$ people put into weddings and receptions. I've never been @ a wedding recep where there's wine at the tables for ex. These all sound so lavish! Yet I'm sure most of the people here aren't rich. The $$ people spend on these events just astonishes me. Last wedding I went to was at my friend's house, there were snacks afterwards and a couple of bottles of wine. That's it.", "See point 1. If provide enough $$ so people can drink excessively, then you can't be surprised when people drink excessively.", "Right?! I've been to multiple open bar weddings and events. As far as I know,  nothing crazy happened at any of them, and while I suppose someone may have had 12 drinks, there's no way that was the average at any formal event I've ever been to! One stupid drunken accident happening at an open bar event I could understand, but property damage so extensive it costs more than the bar, sex in the coat room, a DUI with damage to multiple cars, AND altercations resulting in police presence just sounds bonkers . . . I have to conclude the problem was the people rather than the open bar.", "Their friends are assholes. NTA.", "I was curious about this too. I\u2019ve been to many open bar weddings and had one myself. No damage like that has ever been done at any I\u2019ve been to. And 12 drinks a person? We averaged 4-5.", "This isn\u2019t normal for alcoholics. Maybe they are all young.", "Maybe super super young? Never been to a wedding this insane though.", "I just meant to explain that in some age groups/countries/areas/etc it could be expected that an open bar leads to issues... And something here does give me the feeling that OP knew his daughters friends better then she did..", "Gifts aren\u2019t (or at least shouldn\u2019t be) intended to cover the cost of a wedding.", "Yup, best wedding I've ever been to had a open bar, but no liquor", "I'm sure that all of them do not.  But there was a non zero chance that this would happen.  People can drink as much as they want at home. Not everyone gets a DUI.  Why take that chance on such an important day.", "First thing, he isn't surprised. As he wrote, it went as he had assumed it would. \nNext, it isn't his duty to be policing anyone the limits of drinking. They are adults, and it's thei prerogative to take care of it. \nLastly, his question for judging was different to the reason you gave.", "This wedding reception sounds insane, and OP refusing to have his name on the rental paperwork makes me think this isn\u2019t the first time a party with them has gone off the rails.", "DUI in the parking lot is insanity", "Nah man. We got married fairly young- college kids in the wedding party young. Passing out in the road ditch young.\nThere was a fight with the bartender (the bartender shut it down).\n\n\nThere was not a single DUI and no property damage. This was out of control."]}
