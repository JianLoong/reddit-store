The stories that come out of them are wild. I\u2019ve been to over 2 dozen weddings, all had an open bar except for one.

Your daughter thought 2 bottles of wine per table was tacky.\n\nSounds like their frat style party was super classy, though!\n\nAlso interesting how they're married and probably thinking they're real grownups now... but believe mom and dad should pay for the damages that are a direct result of the free-flowing booze they provided.\n\nThis is just mind-blowing.

Budgeting 12 drinks / guest is assuming quite a lot of alcohol and it seems they consumed it all.\n\nYou gave the bride & groom your opinion.  They CHOSE to not accept it and made their own \"adult\" decision.  They reaped the consequences of that decision.  I hope they find the drunken reception to be worth all the wedding gift money they had to use to pay for the damages.", "NTA - But the whole situation is baffling. A super easy solution would have been to pay for the equivalent of 2 drinks a person and then cash bar. Where I am that is pretty standard. She gets an open bar for the early part of the party and only people who want to spend large amounts of money get plastered.", "Lol - NTA.  Opens bars lead to drunk and disorderly, every time.", "Smart dad, dumb kids.", "NTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "NTA, however, all the guests that CAUSED the damage should have to pay for the damages THEY caused. \n\nAnother thing, the venue needs to get in trouble bc it\u2019s THEIR responsibility to make sure guests aren\u2019t OVER-SERVED. For those of you that don\u2019t know, it\u2019s 100% ILLEGAL to serve alcohol to someone that is already intoxicated. Clearly the bartenders didn\u2019t care and just kept serving ppl that were definitely already piss drunk. \n\nI\u2019ve been a bartender for almost 10 years, and I\u2019ve done HUNDREDS of weddings, I get that it\u2019s a wedding and there\u2019s open bar, but when it\u2019s time to cut someone off, you cut them off, and if other people are getting them drinks after you cut them off, it\u2019s your job as a bartender to make management and security aware of what\u2019s going on, so that they can act accordingly. \n\nNO WAY should your daughter have to pay for all those damages alone, she should counter sue the venue for over serving guests (if possible) and also make the guests that caused the damage pay up. \n\nWhat a mess, oof. And btw, just as a bonus, unless you have more money than you know what to do with, don\u2019t do open bars. Leave it open for cocktail hour and maybe a bonus couple of hours, then cash after that. Or set a limit ($2k, $3k, etc) and then cash bar. It\u2019s not being cheap it\u2019s being responsible. Ppl drink less when it\u2019s cash bar and bartenders also make more money bc ppl actually tend to tip when they have to take their wallet out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Did your daughter really buy enough alcohol for 12 drinks per person? Would they really have had that much to drink if it were a service that just provides an open bar, not a bartender serving what the couple bought in advance? If so, you're right, there should be a practical limit on these guests' drinking. But that is not normal. We did the pay per-person, bar brings to booze and serves what they serve model. It cost more like 2 drinks per person and I think that's about what the guidance was if you were buying your own as well. There is an outside chance that they actually drank *more* because she budgeted for and purchased so much alcohol if they did it that way and there was a sense of \"better drink it now, we can't carry it all home.\" If that's the case, you are a bit responsible, but still NTA because it's not your party and not your job to make those plans.", "Your daughter and her new husband sound like pathetically useless children with perpetual chips on their shoulders.  \n\nYou need to walk away from them for a bit, and let them sit in the very logical, easy-to-predict consequences of their stupid decisions.

But you are NTA", "NTA but I don't know where you live that that's your average drunken stupidity.\n\nWe had an open bar, and our friends are pretty damn loose and the worst that happened at our reception was one of my husband's very small friends tried to start a biffo with a beefcake friend and was laughingly escorted out.", "NTA open bars happen at weddings literally all the time and they typically never go this poorly. This is on them and their friends.", "INFO: Did this wedding have bar staff? Or did you just unleash a group of people on a pile of alcohol?\n\nTrained bartenders generally don\u2019t overserve wedding guests.", "ESH\n\nWhat is wrong with your daughter and son-in-law's friends?   What was wrong with the bartenders the venue hired?  You should look into helping your daughter counter-sue the venue for illegally over-serving her guests.  It sounds like the staff tried to run up the bill (or their own tips) by continuing to serve guests who were obviously a few too deep.  That's illegal and unethical and should make them at fault for a lot of the damage.  \n\nI've been to plenty of weddings with open bars.  I've been to Bar Mitzvahs and Sweet 16s and college graduation parties with open bars.  I've been to a charity auction for traveling carnies with an open bar.  I've never seen party end as badly as you described.\n\nWhat you described was obviously not just because of the open bar.  But it sounds like you had reason to suspect this group couldn't handle their liquor.  Is one of the families a biker gang or something?", "INFO: Why wasn't the bartender cutting people off? They aren't supposed to serve people who are visibly drunk.", "This doesn't make sense... I don't recall any wedding I've been to that was anything but open bar, and there was NEVER this kind of drunken madness at any of them. Are these people all alcoholics? Also, you figured the math at 12 drinks per person?! Is that right?!", "YTA - for even thinking YTA.  Come on dude, how willing are you to finance your children's misbehavior and poor decision making?  Perhaps this is part of the reason why they have poor decision making, because they've always been bailed out by you, or at least have always lived with that assumption.  It's very difficult to transition into adulthood when you've always been treated like a child.", "12 drinks per person for a wedding reception?? Wow. I\u2019m going to say ESH. Daughter and husband should have known their friends/family would get up to something like this and limited alcohol. You should have limited your estimate to something more reasonable. Who was the bartender? Did the venue somehow try to protect the bartender in the contract, or did your daughter have to hire her own bartender? I would think the bartender should be held liable for at least some of the costs. Your daughter and her husband should now turn around and sue the bartender if possible.", "NTA.  So, OP's daughter didn't want to look tacky and have a cash bar and insisted on an open bar?  She's just learned the meaning of the old adage - with age comes wisdom.\n\nOP saw this coming and was very wise to keep his name off the contract and to put a hard cap on what he would spend.\n\nOP's daughter and new hubby should get copies of the video's that were taken during this time and either demand the ones that did the damage, pay, or they should sue them.

Good on you for standing your ground.", "NTA. But I would say the guests were questionable people. Only ever been to family weddings and there has always, always been an open bar (big family so been to a fair amount), and this has never happened.

You suggested the sensible route, they, as adults, chose another route. \n\nIf you had insisted on your choice the complaint would have been different (being tacky, which is ridiculous btw), but there still would have been a complaint.\n\nPaying for as much as you did is a HUGE gift and I really feel should be appreciated more.", "NTA. I would never in a million years have expected it to end up like that. I\u2019ve attended many open bar weddings and had one myself. No damage has ever been done at one I\u2019ve been to.

Nah, they chose the open bar, and they can pay for the consequences.", "NTA. Limiting booze at an event isn't tacky and you had the foresight to not have your name on any paperwork. \n\nAny cent you contributed to their wedding was already huge gift. They weren't owed an open bar or the absence of consequences.", "NTA -   \n1. They're adults, they chose to have an open bar, now they pay the price for having a shit-ton of alcoholic 'friends'  \n2. 12 drinks per person? That is really a lot of alcohol.

But 12 drinks per person???????", "NTA, the guests that caused the damages and disturbances should be on the hook for the costs. I come from a pretty rowdy family and I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing. When we have weddings with open bars we usually rent limos so no one drives.

I don't think with 200 guests the couple could be aware how everyone planned to get back home.", "I\u2019m not sure how it would be handled - I\u2019m not involved in restaurants or events here.  I\u2019d guess they\u2019d have made transportation plans ahead of time before serving so much alcohol at an event.\n\nWhen I go to events where there is drinking, people are always pretty aware of who drove there.  The one time I can remember when a driver decided to drink, he called a taxi company and they sent out a car with two drivers - one to drive him home and a second to drive his car home.", "They demanded an open bar because they knew their guests would complain if they couldn\u2019t get shit-faced for free. Absolutely predictable.", "Yeah, the bartender and the venue itself could get into some serious trouble. IDK what it\u2019s like in OP\u2019s state, but in my state an event like this causing a certain amount of property damage would result in the venue losing its liquor license and the bartender being barred from working in places that serve alcohol for a set amount of years (I believe it\u2019s 5). Plus, they could be sued for the property damage to the cars, but the venue should have insurance which should kick in when it comes to that.", "12 drinks each?!", "Are people really drinking 4 drinks an hour in a 3 hour reception and getting shit faced? ALL of them? Even the drivers?", "Summer season in Spain doesn't officially start until the first Brit dies by throwing himself out of a balcony.\n\nWe even coined a new term to describe it: balconing", "British-American solidarity\ud83d\ude14", "Most receptions I've been to are considerably longer than 3 hours.\n\nThe last time I was involved in the budget for a wedding, they said to allow for 8-9 drinks per guest.", "There\u2019s wine at the tables too. I\u2019ve never seen a wedding give out 8-12 drink tickets. Weddings I\u2019ve been to gave 2 per guest and you buy the rest. No one is getting shitfaced and breaking stuff. How is the respectful to your friends who spent a fortune on a wedding and venue? Adults don\u2019t all do that at bars why would everyone get wasted at a wedding when half have to drive home. Shots and mixed drinks are higher in alcohol than beer.", "He presumed 12 drinks per guest?! 12, not one - two. If that\u2019s not a typo then dad knew the people invited to the wedding we\u2019re hardcore alcoholics. If you presume 12 drinks per person you should be having a wedding in the middle of a huge field, not where the drunkards can damage an expensive venue", "True but if they had to pay themselves they probably wouldn't of drank as much,  thus avoiding the aftermath.  Nta op, you tried to limit and warned them beforehand, they didn't  took your advice and now face the consequences.  It's  called  growing up and taking responsibility for your decisions.", "I've never been to an open bar that actually had tickets. It's just \"go up to the bar and order what you want\". \n\nI agree if you're the type of person who breaks stuff when you're drunk, then you shouldn't get faced, but that's a completely different issue.", "Hell, OP themself just called it \"your average drunken stupidity.\" I suspect there's a lot of irresponsible people in their orbit.", "Budgeting for 12 drinks each should have been the dead giveaway...", "Or they would have brought booze in. This isn't about the open bar, it's about destructive people.", "12 beers would make the average person absolutely shithouse in America. Draft beers tend to be 16 oz pours here.", "I dunno, 12 drinks over an all day affair isn't ridiculous. My wedding, welcome drinks, drinks during photos, with the meal etc, for the toasts, that's 4 drinks minimum, and the party's barely even started. This would have taken you to like, 2:30 in the afternoon. We partied till midnight....", "My dad would have managed but he was abardened habitual functioning alcoholic.  I would struggle with 4 at a wedding. Maybe 5 if it's a long one. Last time I'd had two and a soft drink and we were staying in the building. The daughters guests must have gone hard drive it was a college party, it makes me wonder how old they and their guests are.", "sometimes it's not their fault, although it does sound like overserving here. what actually counts for a court case to be viable at least in my state is complicated & I've bartended a long time. people can be black out & seem completely normal (I know several guys like this) or at least keep it together at the bar, it can be hard to prove they knowingly over served.", "Every wedding I've been to or been in started no earlier than 5pm... Asking a large group of people, 200 at that, to get together and drink (and somehow moderate themselves as they get drunker) all day sounds like a disaster no matter how cordial they might all be under normal circumstances.", "Every wedding I've ever been to started at 2pm or earlier and went on late into the evening."]}
