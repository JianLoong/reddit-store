Nothing that can't be fixed with a simple conversation. If you knew she is sending you signals, as a good husband you should at least ask her if she wants anything and go from there, even when you were making a sandwich, you could've asked her if she wanted one too, its not that big of a deal. She on the other hand acts like a child, sending \"signals\" behaving like she cant open the fridge to make something with signalling she's hungry, this all just sucks and its a lack of communication. ESH", "I have to ask... you sound more like businesspartners who are looking at hours and money and distrust each other, and not like a couple who loves each other. Are you even ok?", "Relationships aren't just about contractual obligations. Sometimes one really just should do something nice for their partner for the hell of it. It will make your relationship better in the long run, stronger, closer, if you actually just occasionally do something sweet just because, without being asked or feeling like you have to. Fairness really doesn't come into play. If you love someone then you should want to make their life better and help them out now and then.  NAH", "ESH. What a weird power struggle.", "ESH - Stop behaving like children. Both of you.", "Sometimes you just want someone to take care of you. But for some reason, you don't want to ask directly. There's no logic in it, you just sometimes want to receive care in the form of a sandwich when you've just hinted at it.", "> should I just accept that not everything should be viewed through a fairness lens?\n\nYes, that one.\n\nShe was busy all day, you were playing video games. Didn't occur to you that maybe you could take five minutes out of your day to fix her lunch just, like... to be nice to her? To make her day easier?\n\nBecause she might smile at you and, like, that's a thing that's an important goal in your life because she's your wife and you love her and it makes you happy?", "ESH\n\nBoth of you sound like children", "NTA. If she had time to complain that much then she had time to make a sandwich.", "NTA. I agree with the other comment that you both need maturing. She's grown up enough to communicate exactly what she wants. She wants you to make her a nice snack? \"Hey, baby, can you please make me a nice sandwich?\". And you're grown up enough to not ignore her based on assumptions. Never assume anything in a relationship. You're not inside their minds to really know what they want.", "ESH\n\nShe could have fixed herself something and you should have asked her if she wanted the sandwich when you went to make one for herself.

On your days are you cooking something with minimal effort? On hers is she taking more time and care over it? She may be feeling that the split isn't really that even because she's preparing fancy meals for you (even if you're not fussed about those) and receiving quick/easy meals in return. \n\nI do think, as others have said, that if you love your partner that surely comes with a desire to sometimes do something nice for them just because. If food isn't something you appreciate, maybe you're receiving (or would like to receive) her efforts in another way? It sounds like for her having something nice cooked without asking once in a while is a way she could feel really loved and appreciated by you. I'd just take this occasion as a bit of insider knowledge about a way to make your wife feel appreciated on future occasions. She might just need to be thought of without the transactional element sometimes.\n\nYou're probably not an AH in this specific situation, but this is probably more of an overall despair at the transactional dynamic you have in your relationship.

She should have just asked, but if you were knowingly ignoring her nudging you about making her something it isn\u2019t the most considerate.

You don't sound like a couple, and do you love her? Like someone on top said, it's a very childish situation. And you could at least ordered some food for her.

Maybe you split everything", "Nothing about what you did was wrong. However, you missed an opportunity to show you care for her! Not all things need to be 50/50. You can sway it in her favor from time to time to show your love. Love is shown in many ways. Most people save the chocolates and flowers for special occasions. I find the things that stick more are the random acts of love on a average Tuesday.", "There are already so many good points here so all I\u2019m going to say is this: wouldn\u2019t you rather have gotten in an \u201cargument\u201d over breaking a (albeit ridiculous) rule and doing an usually nice thing for your wife to show your love and care than this? YES, SHE WAS \u201cTRYING TO COAX YOU INTO MAKING HER SOMETHING\u201d\u2026 and you dug your heels in. Successful marriage IS putting in \u201cextra effort\u201d for someone else.

I think you were hinting that you wanted me to make you lunch, and I\u2019d have been really happy to make you a sandwich, but I just didn\u2019t pick up on the hints\u201d.

Why not cook together?  Or take a single day and meal prep together for a week.  My girlfriend and I meal prep every Sunday.  Often slicing veggies, making sauces, or stocks, or even a paste, that will be used that week in recipes.  You can also premake some freezer meals that are easy to reheat when you are feeling hungry and lazy.\n\nRight now, since we refilled on sunday, my freezer has about 20 homemade breakfast burritos, some curry, bolognese, and there is a large pot of chicken stock in the fridge with about a week worth of sliced/diced veggies.  \n\nWe often do prefer to cook together but if we have a busy day we can put some rice in the rice cooker and warm up the curry, boil some noodles and heat the bolognese, or if we are in a rush in the morning, pop a couple of the breakfast burritos in the microwave.", "NTA.

I reluctantly agreed because like people say what's fair is fair.", "And you know this how??", "In the initial post it is phrased as \u201cpersonal stuff\u201d That was keeping her busy, and I would 100% call a hobby that\u2019s keeping them busy personal stuff.", "You are right and it makes sense.  Alot of people here are right.  It's just difficult to explain without context. \n\n Thank you I am sure we will be fine. Sandwich gate will pass and Me and my wife will have many \"colorful\" debates in the future.", "I know it may seem like it, but we do really love each other.  Thank you mate and good luck to you.", "What you moved in together after your first date? Was it an arranged marraige?", "That doesn't mean do the bare fucking minimum.", "I wish you two a happy life\ud83e\udef6", "No, she moved in with me on our second date. Which admittingly was not long after our first date.  She had to get away from her abusive husband.  We dated for a few years and got married our 10th year anniversary is coming up in little over a month.", "I don't think this has anything to do with Feminism . Isn't feminism more about independence , equal right and equal opportunities? And by your logic , isn't Feminism about not depending on anyone to do something for us like the old days when we can ourselves do it . And clearly they both have an agreement . And she just wanted someone to care for her a little bit which is not wrong . But she should have just asked outright . And he obviously thought she would ask for an elaborate meal instead of just a sandwich so he didn't ask her which I can understand . But pulling in Feminism here seems like a pretty childish thing ."]}
