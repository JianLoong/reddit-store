Nothing that can't be fixed with a simple conversation. If you knew she is sending you signals, as a good husband you should at least ask her if she wants anything and go from there, even when you were making a sandwich, you could've asked her if she wanted one too, its not that big of a deal. She on the other hand acts like a child, sending \"signals\" behaving like she cant open the fridge to make something with signalling she's hungry, this all just sucks and its a lack of communication. ESH", "I have to ask... you sound more like businesspartners who are looking at hours and money and distrust each other, and not like a couple who loves each other. Are you even ok?", "Relationships aren't just about contractual obligations. Sometimes one really just should do something nice for their partner for the hell of it. It will make your relationship better in the long run, stronger, closer, if you actually just occasionally do something sweet just because, without being asked or feeling like you have to. Fairness really doesn't come into play. If you love someone then you should want to make their life better and help them out now and then.  NAH", "ESH. What a weird power struggle.", "ESH - Stop behaving like children. Both of you.", "Sometimes you just want someone to take care of you. But for some reason, you don't want to ask directly. There's no logic in it, you just sometimes want to receive care in the form of a sandwich when you've just hinted at it.", "> should I just accept that not everything should be viewed through a fairness lens?\n\nYes, that one.\n\nShe was busy all day, you were playing video games. Didn't occur to you that maybe you could take five minutes out of your day to fix her lunch just, like... to be nice to her? To make her day easier?\n\nBecause she might smile at you and, like, that's a thing that's an important goal in your life because she's your wife and you love her and it makes you happy?", "ESH\n\nBoth of you sound like children", "NTA. If she had time to complain that much then she had time to make a sandwich.", "NTA. I agree with the other comment that you both need maturing. She's grown up enough to communicate exactly what she wants. She wants you to make her a nice snack? \"Hey, baby, can you please make me a nice sandwich?\". And you're grown up enough to not ignore her based on assumptions. Never assume anything in a relationship. You're not inside their minds to really know what they want.", "ESH\n\nShe could have fixed herself something and you should have asked her if she wanted the sandwich when you went to make one for herself. Such a minor thing and you two turned it into a fight.", "What a weird, arbitrary rule. What is the point of marriage if every single thing is each man for himself.

On your days are you cooking something with minimal effort? On hers is she taking more time and care over it? She may be feeling that the split isn't really that even because she's preparing fancy meals for you (even if you're not fussed about those) and receiving quick/easy meals in return. \n\nI do think, as others have said, that if you love your partner that surely comes with a desire to sometimes do something nice for them just because. If food isn't something you appreciate, maybe you're receiving (or would like to receive) her efforts in another way? It sounds like for her having something nice cooked without asking once in a while is a way she could feel really loved and appreciated by you. I'd just take this occasion as a bit of insider knowledge about a way to make your wife feel appreciated on future occasions. She might just need to be thought of without the transactional element sometimes.\n\nYou're probably not an AH in this specific situation, but this is probably more of an overall despair at the transactional dynamic you have in your relationship. You both deserve to feel appreciated through your partner's words and actions, and you've got to figure out what that looks like for each of you.\n\nNAH.", "NTA.

Having said that, while on the surface she may have been having an okay day, she possibly was just feeling the need for a little attention.

I think an agreement for meals and dinner is nice, but it\u2019s not a business contract and although you aren\u2019t obligated to, i feel that you should want to do something nice for your wife especially if she\u2019s been hinting at it. She should have just asked, but if you were knowingly ignoring her nudging you about making her something it isn\u2019t the most considerate. I understand both POVs but i would just communicate with her. Again, if she had been hinting about being hungry for a while it would be really easy just to make her whatever you were snacking on as well. just simple and considerate.", "ESH It doesn\u2019t take much effort to say, \u201cWould you like a crisp sandwich?\u201d", "Nta she should be direct", "She could have been having a bad day and just needed someone to do something for her.

He IGNORED me. 11/10 \n\n\nThis made me realize how manipulative passive aggressive behavior is. I had to grow up and learn adult methods of clear communication.  Which has made it much easier to communicate with people overall.\n\n\nJust a thought,  making up several meals ahead of time and freezing them sure makes it easy to have a great meal with a short time investment.", "NTA \n\nDid you marry a toddler without the strength to open the fridge or dexterity to untwist those twisty things on the bread bag?\n\nSeriously.", "NTA.

Dude, relationship is all about compromising, bending, and accommodating your partner (to a point). I wonder how far you would push this agreement. \n\nYou both need to grow the fuck up. In this case, you in particular. \n\nYTA. Thow that agreement in trash, or just make every meal for yourself.", "Info: What personal stuff was she busy with?", "Info: why are you together? You seem to despise each other.", "ESH\n\nYou people sound like children.\n\nWife was doing some kind of helpless act.\nYou, on the other hand, did make yourself something to eat knowing she was hungry.  You could have offered to make a second of whatever you were already making.  She could have declined, but it\u2019s the offer that matters.", "Agreement? Is she your roommate? You don't sound like a couple, and do you love her? Like someone on top said, it's a very childish situation. And you could at least ordered some food for her. Maybe she's \"testing\" your care about her, yes, on a very immature way. But really, with a marriage like that, I'd rather being alone. But each to their own. Maybe you split everything", "Nothing about what you did was wrong. However, you missed an opportunity to show you care for her! Not all things need to be 50/50. You can sway it in her favor from time to time to show your love. Love is shown in many ways. Most people save the chocolates and flowers for special occasions. I find the things that stick more are the random acts of love on a average Tuesday.", "There are already so many good points here so all I\u2019m going to say is this: wouldn\u2019t you rather have gotten in an \u201cargument\u201d over breaking a (albeit ridiculous) rule and doing an usually nice thing for your wife to show your love and care than this? YES, SHE WAS \u201cTRYING TO COAX YOU INTO MAKING HER SOMETHING\u201d\u2026 and you dug your heels in. Successful marriage IS putting in \u201cextra effort\u201d for someone else. Your choice of language is sus and I think the \u201cidiosyncrasies\u201d you refer to are evident within the writing so I won\u2019t be passing AH judgement here. Just do better.

The laundry ? Cleaning bathrooms ?  I wonder if she was doing these \u201cpersonal things\u201d while he was gaming.", "ESH.

Wonder what else she has to ask you to do.", "ESH\n\nYou're both acting childish. The rules etc work in theory but in practice it'll just do more harm than good.\n\nYou're a team, partners.

I think you were hinting that you wanted me to make you lunch, and I\u2019d have been really happy to make you a sandwich, but I just didn\u2019t pick up on the hints\u201d.

Sometimes you just need to be considerate. If ahe asked for something specific or too time taking, you could tell her you didn\u2019t feel it it. I know if my boyfriend was hungry and asked me, i would\u2019ve done something even if a quick fix and vice versa.\n\nSeems like you guys just need better communication in situations like these.
