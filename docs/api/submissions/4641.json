{"id": 4641, "submission_id": "zl3h2s", "title": "AITA for telling my step-son that \u201cthems the breaks\u201d my daughter can go to college but he can\u2019t?", "selftext": "My (49F) daughter Catie (17) is graduating high school this spring and was just accepted to her first college last week. I share Catie with her father (my ex-husband) Will (52M), but have been married to my husband Brian (49M) for about 6 years. Brian has a son Nick (16) who is a junior at the same school as Catie. Brian has full custody of Nick while I share custody of Catie. \n\nWill and I divorced fairly amicably when Catie was young, and have grown into strong coparents. Will\u2019s family comes from substantial money, so as part of the divorce we agreed that he would be responsible for the tuition and dorm bill for Catie\u2019s college, and I would pay for the other miscellaneous living expenses. I have saved enough to pay for these expenses, but I know that if something were to happen to my savings, Will or his family would be able to foot the entire bill for Catie\u2019s living expenses without any changes to his lifestyle. \n\nWill and I decided to sit Catie down and show her the whole picture of what college costs and what we will pay for. Brian thought it would be a good idea to have a similar conversation with Nick even though he is only a junior. \n\nUnfortunately, the financial situation for Nick differs. Since his mother is not in the picture, it has been on Brian to save for Nick\u2019s college. Brian was able to save and I have also contributed a bit, and he has about enough saved for a full associates degree or half bachelors degree at an in-state public school without living expenses.\n\nWe didn\u2019t openly discuss the specifics of the different finances with each child, but did broadly say that they had different opportunities due to situations outside of their control. Nick has since surmised that his situation is very different from Catie\u2019s and his choices will be much more impacted by finances than hers.\n\nNick came to Brian and I very upset over the weekend. He said that It wasn\u2019t fair that Catie got to go anywhere she wanted and he specifically was upset that Catie would not have to pay for her own room and board. He then asked that if Catie gets into a school with scholarships, if he could get the difference in tuition for his college. Or, he said that I should contribute the savings I had for Catie to his fund to try and make it more fair since Will could make up the difference easily. I kindly told him that no, I wouldn\u2019t do that and that I\u2019m really sorry that the situation. Then I told him that unfortunately, sometimes \u201cthems the breaks\u201d in life and that we will do our best to make sure that whatever college he decides to go to that he can make the most of the opportunity even with loans. \n\nNick was obviously upset at this and Brian thinks my response to his asking made me a bit of an asshole even though I shouldn\u2019t have to change any of the agreement. I feel like I\u2019m going crazy but AITA?\n\nETA: I had condensed this post for character limits but wanted to add a bit about the actual conversation. This was the follow up conversation to the longer one my husband had with him about how much money we were able to contribute to college, so he already knew the specifics of what we have saved for him. I\u2019m trying to be as objective as possible. Our follow up was a conversation that was over 10 minutes long - most of it was saying that we were sorry about how this situation impacts him and that it\u2019s really difficult seeing people close to you get opportunities you can\u2019t have. I did not default to \u201cthems the breaks\u201d but then yes, I did say those exact words (I must be older than I thought) after Nick got increasingly angry and frustrated. I didn\u2019t intend to be callous but I love Nick and I will apologize for being unkind and make sure to repeat the things Brian told him about the fund in the first place: there are so many options for you and we are excited to support you to make whatever future you want happen for you.", "created_utc": 1670957344, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zl3h2s/aita_for_telling_my_stepson_that_thems_the_breaks/", "score": 3624, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He has more college funds than a lot of his peers. He's just not going to get a full ride from his family. He can still go wherever he wants to, it's just that there may be more long-term financial costs to those decisions. Or, he could get a full ride from a school. Or half from school. A lot of things could happen. But knowing now means that he knows more is riding on his grades and test scores than on Catie's.\n\nIt's not either Catie nor Nick's fault that their situations are different. You have legal obligations to Catie per the divorce agreement with Will. Nick can't lay claim to those. And Brian doesn't have the same funds as Will. And Nick's mom is a deadbeat, and you don't have the funds to make what rightly was her contribution for her. That sucks for Nick, but nothing is going to change it.

She sat me down and told me point blank, that neither she nor my dad would be paying for college. I came from a poor, blue collar family.  I won't go into the rest, but that conversation needed to happen.  I wouldn't be where I am now without that reality check.\n\nNick needed that now, at about the same age I was.  You laid out what you can and can't pay for.  Catie's situation is really none of his business.  Hopefully it will spur him on to get his grades and ACT/SAT scores up so that he can get a scholarship and more choices.\n\nEdit: \"Thems the breaks\" is not assholish.  Direct and blunt, but not assholish.", "Nta he absolutely can go. He may have to take out loans, or choose based on funding but to say he can't go is over dramatic.\n\nBased on OPs comments, she spent the majority of the conversation sympathizing. But she is absolutely  in the right to not hand over her daughter's college fund to her son.", "YTA for how you responded.\n\nExplaining to Nick that your agreement can't be amended, doesn't need to be said in a flippant dismissive way. Nick and Catie are being raised as siblings and you are the only mother he has.\n\n\"Nick, this is the most we can afford. Essentially, your dad and I have saved this much for your education. I can't expect Catie's dad to help pay for  your schooling by picking up the expenses I agreed to years ago.\n\nKeep working hard, try to get scholarships to help pay for schooling and we will give you what we have saved toward your education.\"", "NTA- It was completely inappropriate for Nick to ask to take away from what Catie's own family had been planning for years on her behalf. I might even ask him if he actually thinks that he is entitled for Catie's dad to subsidize his education, and if so, on what basis.\n\nThere is no such thing as fair. This concept of fair is akin to believing the world owes you something and to level things for you if you see somebody with something you want. As Yellowstone's John Dutton put it, \u201cLet me tell you what fair means. Fair means one side got exactly what they wanted in a way that the other side can't complain about. There's no such thing as fair.\u201d  Bottom line- whatever Catie's Dad is doing for her and whatever OP has saved for her is nothing to do with Nick.\n\nI would strongly advise cautioning Catie to tread lightly on this subject understanding that it's a sensitive and potentially volatile one. To count her blessings quietly.\n\nTo the specific judgement- \"thems the breaks\" is a little harsh but sometimes that's what it takes to back down an entitled child. He needs to get that he needs to change his perspective on all of this.", "NTA. I kinda wish my parents had had more of a discussion about it with me than they did.

My grades were pretty good, but they weren\u2019t straight As. But I refused to listen to her. I was set on going to college, but for a lot of reasons.

It doesn't sound like you were trying to be hurtful, just honest.\n\nIt IS difficult for children to understand that in mixed family situations not everyone gets the exact same treatment.  So what Nick sees as \"fair\" doesn't necessarily line up with the realities of the families' finances.  In your case it's because of your former husband's excellent financial situation, and you can't make up the difference to make financial parity for Nick.\n\nStill, if the whole point is attending college, where there's a will there's usually a way:  small scholarships (get a list from his HS advisor and make him get to work on applying!), Pell Grants, financial hardship applications, student loans, and working while at school can come together to cover the costs.  Also, some states offer 0-percent loans that are converted to grants (free money!) if the applicant meets certain performance criteria while in school.\n\nSo you three may have to do more research and applying but it's doable. \n\nGood luck.", "YTA \n\nYou didn't have to be cruel or flippant.\n\nYou could have explained in detail why their opportunities are different.

Assuming the amount you'll contribute to him is roughly equivalent, then its just a messed up situation.  I understand Nick being upset at the situation, but it is a definite understandable situation.", "YTA for the way you handled the conversation.  That was just rude!  \nYou could encourage him to get good grades and apply for scholarships.  You could encourage him to get a PT job and save up money.  You could explain the difference in the family dynamic between he and his step sister.  But you don't say \"thems the breaks\"", "YTA. You\u2019re not wrong, but you were an AH on how you expressed yourself.

You were completely honest with Nick, even if \"thems the breaks\" isn't how I would've worded it.  \n\n\nThe truth is, the situation *isn't* fair to Nick, but as we all know, life is rarely fair.

You two aren't living this lavish life either. It's not like you're choosing a vacation in Europe over his education or anything, but he's a kid. It isn't fair, but life isn't fair. It's a major life lesson to him now, and to me, as a mom as well, this is the hill to die on. It's a MAJOR life lesson SO MANY parents don't want to teach their kids these days.

I think recognizing and focusing more on the fact that you are legally obligated to pay your portion, per parenting agreement, but you and your husband did the best you could to save for him. \n\nI also agree with other posters that the fact he will have any paid for is better than a lot of ppl. My parents weren't able to contribute to my college, and I won't be able to contribute to my kid's college.

He's just your son at this point.\n\nOthers gave you good advice on how better to phrase it...obviously being flip and cruel in that moment was an AH thing to do. If you were trying to explain their individual situations, you did a poor job of it by making your son feel so hurt.

And I cannot imagine how hard this must be from your side. But I was in Nick's shoes. You need to be really compassionate with him. This is the start of him having to work through the fact that he is most likely going to spend his entire life having to work significantly harder to get the same opportunities he gets to watch your daughter have. And even then he probably wont be allowed many of them no matter how hard he works. That's a hard thing to deal with as a kid. In reality, its pretty bullshit, and the fact that its so unbalanced is honestly something he has a right to be upset about. Its not your fault the systems fucked up though.\n\nAlso. FWIW. if you and your ex are amicable....it shouldn't hurt to ask to change the agreement.

And everyone I know went to state schools. I and most of them ended up with PhDs, and make six figures. Make the most of what schools you have access to!  because the school is not what matters!!!!  It is what you DO with the education available. Please DO sit down with BOTH kids, and discuss what they think they woudl be able to do- not just what they WANT to do, with the programs they are considering.  All of education is too expensive to dink around and end up with no plan to make it pay itself back (and pretty much every education CAN pay for itself over time- but you have to have a plan to make that happen). \n\nExample- if you are into art, do you get an art degree?  Ok, what are you going to be able to DO with that?  How about taking some business courses, so you can work as a art curator for a Fortune 500, or take art as a minor and biology or engineering as a major (or double majors), and apply your art interests in unique ways, like through UI/UX design for software or devices?

I share Catie with her father (my ex-husband) Will (52M), but have been married to my husband Brian (49M) for about 6 years. Brian has a son Nick (16) who is a junior at the same school as Catie. Brian has full custody of Nick while I share custody of Catie. \n\nWill and I divorced fairly amicably when Catie was young, and have grown into strong coparents. Will\u2019s family comes from substantial money, so as part of the divorce we agreed that he would be responsible for the tuition and dorm bill for Catie\u2019s college, and I would pay for the other miscellaneous living expenses. I have saved enough to pay for these expenses, but I know that if something were to happen to my savings, Will or his family would be able to foot the entire bill for Catie\u2019s living expenses without any changes to his lifestyle. \n\nWill and I decided to sit Catie down and show her the whole picture of what college costs and what we will pay for. Brian thought it would be a good idea to have a similar conversation with Nick even though he is only a junior. \n\nUnfortunately, the financial situation for Nick differs. Since his mother is not in the picture, it has been on Brian to save for Nick\u2019s college. Brian was able to save and I have also contributed a bit, and he has about enough saved for a full associates degree or half bachelors degree at an in-state public school without living expenses.\n\nWe didn\u2019t openly discuss the specifics of the different finances with each child, but did broadly say that they had different opportunities due to situations outside of their control. Nick has since surmised that his situation is very different from Catie\u2019s and his choices will be much more impacted by finances than hers.\n\nNick came to Brian and I very upset over the weekend. He said that It wasn\u2019t fair that Catie got to go anywhere she wanted and he specifically was upset that Catie would not have to pay for her own room and board. He then asked that if Catie gets into a school with scholarships, if he could get the difference in tuition for his college. Or, he said that I should contribute the savings I had for Catie to his fund to try and make it more fair since Will could make up the difference easily. I kindly told him that no, I wouldn\u2019t do that and that I\u2019m really sorry that the situation. Then I told him that unfortunately, sometimes \u201cthems the breaks\u201d in life and that we will do our best to make sure that whatever college he decides to go to that he can make the most of the opportunity even with loans. \n\nNick was obviously upset at this and Brian thinks my response to his asking made me a bit of an asshole even though I shouldn\u2019t have to change any of the agreement. I feel like I\u2019m going crazy but AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Nick has benefited from this before as well - his first phone actually was another one Will gave us when he upgraded. We have tried to be as fair as possible about other things growing up from our end but this is definitely the biggest source of inequality between siblings since we got married.", "The tone of the post also feels like OP doesn't care about her stepson at all, even since she's been in his life since ten.

He would never have access to that money anyways.\n\nIt was a bit blunt and forward but this is life. Life won't coddle you so it's best to say it once and for all without sugarcoating it.

We live about 15 minutes from a good public college and he knows he can live here for free if that is the path he chooses. However, at the end of the conversation I did use the exact phrase in the title to try and make part of the conversation more broadly about how opportunities are just sometimes unequal and it sucks - but I\u2019m very willing to apologize for that since it sounds like most people agree that was not well executed", "He\u2019s not her son.

The problem is that per the divorce agreement my savings for Catie is for things like rent off campus, textbooks, groceries, study abroad, school activities, etc. Her father is the one covering tuition, so he\u2019d primarily be the one who would benefit if Catie receives merit scholarships.

It might have been harsh if you used the exact phrase \"thems the breaks\" but I got the feeling you were paraphrasing.\n\nWhen I was in your stepson's position, I think I would have come around if after the \"life is hard and theres no money for college\" talk, my parents had a brief followup and told me that they're sorry for the difficulties I face, and whenever I'm ready to talk about it, they'll help me develop a plan to best use what finances are available and make sure I have the best chances at success going forwards - whatever that may look like, be it community college, trade school, working for a few years to save up, etc. and offering him counseling to work through how he's feeling because its valid to feel bad about the information he just received. \n\nIf you have any questions for me about my experience with community college, transferring, loans, whatever- feel free to DM me and Im happy to share my experience to try and help!", "No, I'd already replied to OP. That reply was just for you.

As his parents it is your responsibility to tell him he cannot go to those schools. Honestly, I outright forbade my daughters from getting student loans. Told them that we wouldn\u2019t co-sign or help them in any way, if they wanted to get loans. Student loans are highly predatory (similar to pay-day-loans). As a parent, it is my responsibility to protect my kids from making huge and devastating decisions like that, and it\u2019s yours too. Also he could join the military. OR join the JROTC for the next 2 years and try for a ROTC scholarship, but that requires military service after graduation. Usually 3-4 years of service per year paid. If he isn\u2019t mature enough to understand why his step-sister has different opportunities than he does and to not be resentful, enlisting would probably be a good idea before college. It\u2019s only a few years and kids grow up a lot during that time. My husband went to a private military high school and then straight to college.

That being said, if he goes the student debt route, see of uni in Canada is a better deal for him.

OP saved money for Catie by herself and just for extra expenses after all tuition and rent (which is comparative pretty small). However, OP's husband AND OP both saved money for Nick. So OP helped save money for him too while not taking any of husband's income for Catie.

While some may say YTA for using that expression, the kid is almost an adult and needs to get a harder look at life.  The blended family makes situations like these difficult.  Some people think that OP should have saved more for step-son, but we don\u2019t know all circumstances other than that she is supposed to hold her end of the bargain for her daughter\u2019s living expenses, although there is a backup plan.  I don\u2019t think that she wants to dive into the backup plan so quickly because this could have bad consequences later.  No, it isn\u2019t so easy to shift the daughter\u2019s college funds to stepson depending on the type of account (maybe 529 or other custodial, tax-deferred account) due to restrictions likely in place with ex-husband if he setup the accounts.  \n\nI\u2019m going to say NTA because this is the reality\u2014he is lucky that he\u2019s got this much funding available because it could be a lot worse like many others that I know whose parents didn\u2019t save at all and could actually afford it and still pay student loans.", "I wish my parents had done this!

Due to their comments (\"thats what Im paying for LOL\" \"What am I paying for over there?\") the lack of convos before....  I truly thought the loans was just a way to stay frugal and they'd announce at the end they were proud of me and they were gone.  NOPE!  I did get a plane ticket to anywhere in the world but how the fck was I supposed to go travel with $100K in loans and a starter job?  \n\nTalk to your kids.

I couldn\u2019t be happier for him. His parents even saved money for him!! That\u2019s like, a wild fantasy for me, a young 20s person with no GED, who\u2019s going nowhere in life because my family couldn\u2019t provide me any opportunities. It\u2019s the same feeling I get when there\u2019s AITA posts about people who are just handed downpayments, and houses, and inheritance, and college, and cars.

The commute to any University would be to expensive, but not expensive enough that it would be cheaper to move out.

But in my country we have the opportunity to do dual studies, where a lot of the costs are covered by your employer. There are\nlimited spaces but now I work 20 hours a week and have University 20 hours a week, at a private university with tuition costs that my job covers. The special thing here is that all students in my course have the same Modell so the university is adjusted to that experience and it is less stressful. I probably would have preferred to have the normal uni experience, but I make a lot more money than I would have made otherwise and at my job I use  what I learn in Uni.", "This!
