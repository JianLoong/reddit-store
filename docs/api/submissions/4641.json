I share Catie with her father (my ex-husband) Will (52M), but have been married to my husband Brian (49M) for about 6 years. Brian has a son Nick (16) who is a junior at the same school as Catie. Brian has full custody of Nick while I share custody of Catie. \n\nWill and I divorced fairly amicably when Catie was young, and have grown into strong coparents. Will\u2019s family comes from substantial money, so as part of the divorce we agreed that he would be responsible for the tuition and dorm bill for Catie\u2019s college, and I would pay for the other miscellaneous living expenses. I have saved enough to pay for these expenses, but I know that if something were to happen to my savings, Will or his family would be able to foot the entire bill for Catie\u2019s living expenses without any changes to his lifestyle. \n\nWill and I decided to sit Catie down and show her the whole picture of what college costs and what we will pay for. Brian thought it would be a good idea to have a similar conversation with Nick even though he is only a junior. \n\nUnfortunately, the financial situation for Nick differs. Since his mother is not in the picture, it has been on Brian to save for Nick\u2019s college. Brian was able to save and I have also contributed a bit, and he has about enough saved for a full associates degree or half bachelors degree at an in-state public school without living expenses.\n\nWe didn\u2019t openly discuss the specifics of the different finances with each child, but did broadly say that they had different opportunities due to situations outside of their control. Nick has since surmised that his situation is very different from Catie\u2019s and his choices will be much more impacted by finances than hers.\n\nNick came to Brian and I very upset over the weekend. He said that It wasn\u2019t fair that Catie got to go anywhere she wanted and he specifically was upset that Catie would not have to pay for her own room and board. He then asked that if Catie gets into a school with scholarships, if he could get the difference in tuition for his college. Or, he said that I should contribute the savings I had for Catie to his fund to try and make it more fair since Will could make up the difference easily. I kindly told him that no, I wouldn\u2019t do that and that I\u2019m really sorry that the situation. Then I told him that unfortunately, sometimes \u201cthems the breaks\u201d in life and that we will do our best to make sure that whatever college he decides to go to that he can make the most of the opportunity even with loans. \n\nNick was obviously upset at this and Brian thinks my response to his asking made me a bit of an asshole even though I shouldn\u2019t have to change any of the agreement.

You could have empathized and sympathized with him and instead decided to take the heartless route.

He has more college funds than a lot of his peers. He's just not going to get a full ride from his family. He can still go wherever he wants to, it's just that there may be more long-term financial costs to those decisions. Or, he could get a full ride from a school. Or half from school. A lot of things could happen. But knowing now means that he knows more is riding on his grades and test scores than on Catie's.\n\nIt's not either Catie nor Nick's fault that their situations are different. You have legal obligations to Catie per the divorce agreement with Will. Nick can't lay claim to those. And Brian doesn't have the same funds as Will. And Nick's mom is a deadbeat, and you don't have the funds to make what rightly was her contribution for her. That sucks for Nick, but nothing is going to change it. Life's not fair, it never was, and it never will be.", "YTA.

But you state that you said you you'd find ways to support him regardless to make sure he still got an education. Could you have said it a little more tactfully? Yes.

She sat me down and told me point blank, that neither she nor my dad would be paying for college. I came from a poor, blue collar family.  I won't go into the rest, but that conversation needed to happen.  I wouldn't be where I am now without that reality check.\n\nNick needed that now, at about the same age I was.  You laid out what you can and can't pay for.  Catie's situation is really none of his business.  Hopefully it will spur him on to get his grades and ACT/SAT scores up so that he can get a scholarship and more choices.\n\nEdit: \"Thems the breaks\" is not assholish.  Direct and blunt, but not assholish.", "Nta he absolutely can go. He may have to take out loans, or choose based on funding but to say he can't go is over dramatic.\n\nBased on OPs comments, she spent the majority of the conversation sympathizing. But she is absolutely  in the right to not hand over her daughter's college fund to her son.", "YTA for how you responded.\n\nExplaining to Nick that your agreement can't be amended, doesn't need to be said in a flippant dismissive way. Nick and Catie are being raised as siblings and you are the only mother he has.\n\n\"Nick, this is the most we can afford. Essentially, your dad and I have saved this much for your education. I can't expect Catie's dad to help pay for  your schooling by picking up the expenses I agreed to years ago.\n\nKeep working hard, try to get scholarships to help pay for schooling and we will give you what we have saved toward your education.\"", "NTA- It was completely inappropriate for Nick to ask to take away from what Catie's own family had been planning for years on her behalf. I might even ask him if he actually thinks that he is entitled for Catie's dad to subsidize his education, and if so, on what basis.\n\nThere is no such thing as fair. This concept of fair is akin to believing the world owes you something and to level things for you if you see somebody with something you want. As Yellowstone's John Dutton put it, \u201cLet me tell you what fair means. Fair means one side got exactly what they wanted in a way that the other side can't complain about. There's no such thing as fair.\u201d  Bottom line- whatever Catie's Dad is doing for her and whatever OP has saved for her is nothing to do with Nick.\n\nI would strongly advise cautioning Catie to tread lightly on this subject understanding that it's a sensitive and potentially volatile one. To count her blessings quietly.\n\nTo the specific judgement- \"thems the breaks\" is a little harsh but sometimes that's what it takes to back down an entitled child. He needs to get that he needs to change his perspective on all of this.", "NTA. I kinda wish my parents had had more of a discussion about it with me than they did. I now have a bachelors degree I don\u2019t use, excessive student debt, and no way to pay it off. \n\nMy mom suggested the community college to start off with. My grades were pretty good, but they weren\u2019t straight As. But I refused to listen to her. I was set on going to college, but for a lot of reasons.

Basically, not all college age kids are rational.", "YTA if you actually said the phrase \"thems the breaks.\"", "NTA\n\nYour husband and his son are dealing with the effects of not having funds for his son\u2019s college education.\n\nThat has nothing to do with you or the funds you have for your daughter\u2019s education. \n\nIt\u2019s not your responsibility to fund his kid\u2019s schooling\u2026.that\u2019s your husband and his family\u2019s responsibility. If they don\u2019t have the funds, look into loans. \n\nYou use the money you and your ex husband have towards your child, as originally planned.", "NTA.  It doesn't sound like you were trying to be hurtful, just honest.\n\nIt IS difficult for children to understand that in mixed family situations not everyone gets the exact same treatment.  So what Nick sees as \"fair\" doesn't necessarily line up with the realities of the families' finances.  In your case it's because of your former husband's excellent financial situation, and you can't make up the difference to make financial parity for Nick.\n\nStill, if the whole point is attending college, where there's a will there's usually a way:  small scholarships (get a list from his HS advisor and make him get to work on applying!), Pell Grants, financial hardship applications, student loans, and working while at school can come together to cover the costs.  Also, some states offer 0-percent loans that are converted to grants (free money!) if the applicant meets certain performance criteria while in school.\n\nSo you three may have to do more research and applying but it's doable. \n\nGood luck.", "YTA \n\nYou didn't have to be cruel or flippant.\n\nYou could have explained in detail why their opportunities are different.

So cold.  Poor kid.  Hope he makes it big and forgets all about you.", "The situation is unfortunate for him, but that's how it is and he seems understanding of that. \n\nSoft YTA for saying \"thems the breaks\" though because it's a bit cold and heartless.

This isn't a situation where you and your husband are paying for Catie's education, it is her fathers family doing so, and you guys are contributing for other things.  Assuming the amount you'll contribute to him is roughly equivalent, then its just a messed up situation.  I understand Nick being upset at the situation, but it is a definite understandable situation.", "YTA for the way you handled the conversation.  That was just rude!  \nYou could encourage him to get good grades and apply for scholarships.  You could encourage him to get a PT job and save up money.  You could explain the difference in the family dynamic between he and his step sister.  But you don't say \"thems the breaks\"", "YTA. You\u2019re not wrong, but you were an AH on how you expressed yourself.

You were completely honest with Nick, even if \"thems the breaks\" isn't how I would've worded it.  \n\n\nThe truth is, the situation *isn't* fair to Nick, but as we all know, life is rarely fair.

But he's going to be upset about it. It's just a tough place to be in. Hang in there. Keep reminding your stepson that you and your husband will financially support him to the best of your ability, but you just don't have the same money as your ex. You two aren't living this lavish life either. It's not like you're choosing a vacation in Europe over his education or anything, but he's a kid. It isn't fair, but life isn't fair. It's a major life lesson to him now, and to me, as a mom as well, this is the hill to die on. It's a MAJOR life lesson SO MANY parents don't want to teach their kids these days.

I think recognizing and focusing more on the fact that you are legally obligated to pay your portion, per parenting agreement, but you and your husband did the best you could to save for him. \n\nI also agree with other posters that the fact he will have any paid for is better than a lot of ppl. My parents weren't able to contribute to my college, and I won't be able to contribute to my kid's college. I will support them by letting them live with me rent free and trying to help financially where I can.

He's just your son at this point.\n\nOthers gave you good advice on how better to phrase it...obviously being flip and cruel in that moment was an AH thing to do. If you were trying to explain their individual situations, you did a poor job of it by making your son feel so hurt.

It's a fine line to be excited and have humility, so also a good lesson for her.\n\nThis could cause some resentment from him and think you really need to get on top of it.

This is the start of him having to work through the fact that he is most likely going to spend his entire life having to work significantly harder to get the same opportunities he gets to watch your daughter have. And even then he probably wont be allowed many of them no matter how hard he works. That's a hard thing to deal with as a kid. In reality, its pretty bullshit, and the fact that its so unbalanced is honestly something he has a right to be upset about. Its not your fault the systems fucked up though.\n\nAlso. FWIW. if you and your ex are amicable....it shouldn't hurt to ask to change the agreement.

And everyone I know went to state schools. I and most of them ended up with PhDs, and make six figures. Make the most of what schools you have access to!  because the school is not what matters!!!!  It is what you DO with the education available. Please DO sit down with BOTH kids, and discuss what they think they woudl be able to do- not just what they WANT to do, with the programs they are considering.  All of education is too expensive to dink around and end up with no plan to make it pay itself back (and pretty much every education CAN pay for itself over time- but you have to have a plan to make that happen). \n\nExample- if you are into art, do you get an art degree?  Ok, what are you going to be able to DO with that?  How about taking some business courses, so you can work as a art curator for a Fortune 500, or take art as a minor and biology or engineering as a major (or double majors), and apply your art interests in unique ways, like through UI/UX design for software or devices? Or be able to develop art for texts books or scientific journals. \n\nOr if you are interested in psychology- HAVE A PLAN to get a graduate degree, or take enough biology/medical classes to compete as a clinical trials staff in Pharma or device.

This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed. This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything.

I share Catie with her father (my ex-husband) Will (52M), but have been married to my husband Brian (49M) for about 6 years. Brian has a son Nick (16) who is a junior at the same school as Catie. Brian has full custody of Nick while I share custody of Catie. \n\nWill and I divorced fairly amicably when Catie was young, and have grown into strong coparents. Will\u2019s family comes from substantial money, so as part of the divorce we agreed that he would be responsible for the tuition and dorm bill for Catie\u2019s college, and I would pay for the other miscellaneous living expenses. I have saved enough to pay for these expenses, but I know that if something were to happen to my savings, Will or his family would be able to foot the entire bill for Catie\u2019s living expenses without any changes to his lifestyle. \n\nWill and I decided to sit Catie down and show her the whole picture of what college costs and what we will pay for. Brian thought it would be a good idea to have a similar conversation with Nick even though he is only a junior. \n\nUnfortunately, the financial situation for Nick differs. Since his mother is not in the picture, it has been on Brian to save for Nick\u2019s college. Brian was able to save and I have also contributed a bit, and he has about enough saved for a full associates degree or half bachelors degree at an in-state public school without living expenses.\n\nWe didn\u2019t openly discuss the specifics of the different finances with each child, but did broadly say that they had different opportunities due to situations outside of their control. Nick has since surmised that his situation is very different from Catie\u2019s and his choices will be much more impacted by finances than hers.\n\nNick came to Brian and I very upset over the weekend. He said that It wasn\u2019t fair that Catie got to go anywhere she wanted and he specifically was upset that Catie would not have to pay for her own room and board. He then asked that if Catie gets into a school with scholarships, if he could get the difference in tuition for his college. Or, he said that I should contribute the savings I had for Catie to his fund to try and make it more fair since Will could make up the difference easily. I kindly told him that no, I wouldn\u2019t do that and that I\u2019m really sorry that the situation. Then I told him that unfortunately, sometimes \u201cthems the breaks\u201d in life and that we will do our best to make sure that whatever college he decides to go to that he can make the most of the opportunity even with loans. \n\nNick was obviously upset at this and Brian thinks my response to his asking made me a bit of an asshole even though I shouldn\u2019t have to change any of the agreement. I feel like I\u2019m going crazy but AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I doubt you would be so flip if that was your daughter you were having to explain things to her if circumstances were different. I think you have irrevocably hurt your husband and stepson because of your attitude and they know (as the rest of us know), you wouldn't have been that flip to your daughter when presenting her with disappointing news.\n\n**Edit:** It almost seems like you felt enjoyment in being arrogant. I hope that isn't the case.", "NTA, one parent is funding it... His dad even asking for it is like a neighbor asking for it.Same relationship.\n\nPs: chose better words and explain it without bringing emotion's into it....", "NTA. It sounds like you were sympathetic with him throughout the conversation.  I don\u2019t think \u201cthem\u2019s the breaks\u201d at the end is assholish at all.

What you can do is help him save, contribute to his 529 or other savings plan, be proactive with helping him identifying and applying for scholarships, and be on top of the FAFSA and CSS so he gets as much financial aid as possible.", "Thanks for your judgement.\nI think what has made it hard is Nick is acutely aware of Will\u2019s wealth, since he knows Catie is able to go on luxurious vacations with her fathers family and often has, and we have some hand-me-down nice things from Will like a tv and a speaker system that he was kind enough to give us because he upgrades those types of things frequently. Nick has benefited from this before as well - his first phone actually was another one Will gave us when he upgraded. We have tried to be as fair as possible about other things growing up from our end but this is definitely the biggest source of inequality between siblings since we got married.", "The tone of the post also feels like OP doesn't care about her stepson at all, even since she's been in his life since ten. She just told him to go get loans.\n\nWould be a pretty big slap in the kids face.", "Sorry, I meant more feeling crazy internally about if I should be asking Will to change the agreement - poorly worded and not intended to be about Nick\u2019s potential debt. Thanks for your judgement.", "That's a really good point, actually.", "100% agree. Also him asking for the \"difference\" if Catie was to get a scholarship is short sighted and kind of a ridiculous ask. I'm sure it was stipulated, in writing that she had to pay for the miscellaneous stuff pertaining to Catie's college expenses. If anything, the \"difference\" he mentioned if Catie got scholarships would come from Will, as he wouldn't have to pay as much tuition and room and board. He would never have access to that money anyways.\n\nIt was a bit blunt and forward but this is life. Life won't coddle you so it's best to say it once and for all without sugarcoating it.

Brian did discuss a lot of this with him when he told him the specifics of the college fund, including finding external scholarships (although we haven\u2019t looked into those in too much depth since he\u2019s only a junior although some others have commented some good places to start) and other forms of financial aid, not just loans.

Nick does know that the difference is because of her father\u2019s contributions, which is why he was asking about changing my agreement with Will. The conversation between Nick, Brian, and I lasted more than 10 minutes where I did spend most of the time sympathizing and saying I was sorry he had to watch his sister have a different situation than him and that our job was to maximize our ability to set him up as best we could for post grad life. We live about 15 minutes from a good public college and he knows he can live here for free if that is the path he chooses. However, at the end of the conversation I did use the exact phrase in the title to try and make part of the conversation more broadly about how opportunities are just sometimes unequal and it sucks - but I\u2019m very willing to apologize for that since it sounds like most people agree that was not well executed", "He\u2019s not her son.

It just ended with the more broad \u201clife lesson\u201d that was admittedly a bit harsher than the sympathy was", "Thanks for your judgement. The problem is that per the divorce agreement my savings for Catie is for things like rent off campus, textbooks, groceries, study abroad, school activities, etc. Her father is the one covering tuition, so he\u2019d primarily be the one who would benefit if Catie receives merit scholarships.

Is it possible he works and covers this cost himself while living at home, giving you and your husband two more (maybe 3!) years to save up to better cover his costs at university?
