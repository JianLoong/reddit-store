{"id": 4641, "submission_id": "zl3h2s", "title": "AITA for telling my step-son that \u201cthems the breaks\u201d my daughter can go to college but he can\u2019t?", "selftext": "My (49F) daughter Catie (17) is graduating high school this spring and was just accepted to her first college last week. I share Catie with her father (my ex-husband) Will (52M), but have been married to my husband Brian (49M) for about 6 years. Brian has a son Nick (16) who is a junior at the same school as Catie. Brian has full custody of Nick while I share custody of Catie. \n\nWill and I divorced fairly amicably when Catie was young, and have grown into strong coparents. Will\u2019s family comes from substantial money, so as part of the divorce we agreed that he would be responsible for the tuition and dorm bill for Catie\u2019s college, and I would pay for the other miscellaneous living expenses. I have saved enough to pay for these expenses, but I know that if something were to happen to my savings, Will or his family would be able to foot the entire bill for Catie\u2019s living expenses without any changes to his lifestyle. \n\nWill and I decided to sit Catie down and show her the whole picture of what college costs and what we will pay for. Brian thought it would be a good idea to have a similar conversation with Nick even though he is only a junior. \n\nUnfortunately, the financial situation for Nick differs. Since his mother is not in the picture, it has been on Brian to save for Nick\u2019s college. Brian was able to save and I have also contributed a bit, and he has about enough saved for a full associates degree or half bachelors degree at an in-state public school without living expenses.\n\nWe didn\u2019t openly discuss the specifics of the different finances with each child, but did broadly say that they had different opportunities due to situations outside of their control. Nick has since surmised that his situation is very different from Catie\u2019s and his choices will be much more impacted by finances than hers.\n\nNick came to Brian and I very upset over the weekend. He said that It wasn\u2019t fair that Catie got to go anywhere she wanted and he specifically was upset that Catie would not have to pay for her own room and board. He then asked that if Catie gets into a school with scholarships, if he could get the difference in tuition for his college. Or, he said that I should contribute the savings I had for Catie to his fund to try and make it more fair since Will could make up the difference easily. I kindly told him that no, I wouldn\u2019t do that and that I\u2019m really sorry that the situation. Then I told him that unfortunately, sometimes \u201cthems the breaks\u201d in life and that we will do our best to make sure that whatever college he decides to go to that he can make the most of the opportunity even with loans. \n\nNick was obviously upset at this and Brian thinks my response to his asking made me a bit of an asshole even though I shouldn\u2019t have to change any of the agreement. I feel like I\u2019m going crazy but AITA?\n\nETA: I had condensed this post for character limits but wanted to add a bit about the actual conversation. This was the follow up conversation to the longer one my husband had with him about how much money we were able to contribute to college, so he already knew the specifics of what we have saved for him. I\u2019m trying to be as objective as possible. Our follow up was a conversation that was over 10 minutes long - most of it was saying that we were sorry about how this situation impacts him and that it\u2019s really difficult seeing people close to you get opportunities you can\u2019t have. I did not default to \u201cthems the breaks\u201d but then yes, I did say those exact words (I must be older than I thought) after Nick got increasingly angry and frustrated. I didn\u2019t intend to be callous but I love Nick and I will apologize for being unkind and make sure to repeat the things Brian told him about the fund in the first place: there are so many options for you and we are excited to support you to make whatever future you want happen for you.", "created_utc": 1670957344, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zl3h2s/aita_for_telling_my_stepson_that_thems_the_breaks/", "score": 582, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He has more college funds than a lot of his peers. He's just not going to get a full ride from his family. He can still go wherever he wants to, it's just that there may be more long-term financial costs to those decisions. Or, he could get a full ride from a school. Or half from school. A lot of things could happen. But knowing now means that he knows more is riding on his grades and test scores than on Catie's.\n\nIt's not either Catie nor Nick's fault that their situations are different. You have legal obligations to Catie per the divorce agreement with Will. Nick can't lay claim to those. And Brian doesn't have the same funds as Will. And Nick's mom is a deadbeat, and you don't have the funds to make what rightly was her contribution for her. That sucks for Nick, but nothing is going to change it. Life's not fair, it never was, and it never will be.", "YTA.

She sat me down and told me point blank, that neither she nor my dad would be paying for college. I came from a poor, blue collar family.  I won't go into the rest, but that conversation needed to happen.  I wouldn't be where I am now without that reality check.\n\nNick needed that now, at about the same age I was.  You laid out what you can and can't pay for.  Catie's situation is really none of his business.  Hopefully it will spur him on to get his grades and ACT/SAT scores up so that he can get a scholarship and more choices.\n\nEdit: \"Thems the breaks\" is not assholish.  Direct and blunt, but not assholish.", "Nta he absolutely can go. He may have to take out loans, or choose based on funding but to say he can't go is over dramatic.\n\nBased on OPs comments, she spent the majority of the conversation sympathizing. But she is absolutely  in the right to not hand over her daughter's college fund to her son.", "YTA for how you responded.\n\nExplaining to Nick that your agreement can't be amended, doesn't need to be said in a flippant dismissive way. Nick and Catie are being raised as siblings and you are the only mother he has.\n\n\"Nick, this is the most we can afford. Essentially, your dad and I have saved this much for your education. I can't expect Catie's dad to help pay for  your schooling by picking up the expenses I agreed to years ago.\n\nKeep working hard, try to get scholarships to help pay for schooling and we will give you what we have saved toward your education.\"", "NTA- It was completely inappropriate for Nick to ask to take away from what Catie's own family had been planning for years on her behalf. I might even ask him if he actually thinks that he is entitled for Catie's dad to subsidize his education, and if so, on what basis.\n\nThere is no such thing as fair. This concept of fair is akin to believing the world owes you something and to level things for you if you see somebody with something you want. As Yellowstone's John Dutton put it, \u201cLet me tell you what fair means. Fair means one side got exactly what they wanted in a way that the other side can't complain about. There's no such thing as fair.\u201d  Bottom line- whatever Catie's Dad is doing for her and whatever OP has saved for her is nothing to do with Nick.\n\nI would strongly advise cautioning Catie to tread lightly on this subject understanding that it's a sensitive and potentially volatile one. To count her blessings quietly.\n\nTo the specific judgement- \"thems the breaks\" is a little harsh but sometimes that's what it takes to back down an entitled child. He needs to get that he needs to change his perspective on all of this.", "NTA. I kinda wish my parents had had more of a discussion about it with me than they did. I now have a bachelors degree I don\u2019t use, excessive student debt, and no way to pay it off. \n\nMy mom suggested the community college to start off with. My grades were pretty good, but they weren\u2019t straight As. But I refused to listen to her. I was set on going to college, but for a lot of reasons.

Basically, not all college age kids are rational.", "YTA if you actually said the phrase \"thems the breaks.\"", "NTA\n\nYour husband and his son are dealing with the effects of not having funds for his son\u2019s college education.\n\nThat has nothing to do with you or the funds you have for your daughter\u2019s education. \n\nIt\u2019s not your responsibility to fund his kid\u2019s schooling\u2026.that\u2019s your husband and his family\u2019s responsibility. If they don\u2019t have the funds, look into loans. \n\nYou use the money you and your ex husband have towards your child, as originally planned.", "NTA.  It doesn't sound like you were trying to be hurtful, just honest.\n\nIt IS difficult for children to understand that in mixed family situations not everyone gets the exact same treatment.  So what Nick sees as \"fair\" doesn't necessarily line up with the realities of the families' finances.  In your case it's because of your former husband's excellent financial situation, and you can't make up the difference to make financial parity for Nick.\n\nStill, if the whole point is attending college, where there's a will there's usually a way:  small scholarships (get a list from his HS advisor and make him get to work on applying!), Pell Grants, financial hardship applications, student loans, and working while at school can come together to cover the costs.  Also, some states offer 0-percent loans that are converted to grants (free money!) if the applicant meets certain performance criteria while in school.\n\nSo you three may have to do more research and applying but it's doable. \n\nGood luck.", "YTA \n\nYou didn't have to be cruel or flippant.\n\nYou could have explained in detail why their opportunities are different.

So cold.  Poor kid.  Hope he makes it big and forgets all about you.", "The situation is unfortunate for him, but that's how it is and he seems understanding of that. \n\nSoft YTA for saying \"thems the breaks\" though because it's a bit cold and heartless.

This isn't a situation where you and your husband are paying for Catie's education, it is her fathers family doing so, and you guys are contributing for other things.  Assuming the amount you'll contribute to him is roughly equivalent, then its just a messed up situation.  I understand Nick being upset at the situation, but it is a definite understandable situation.", "YTA for the way you handled the conversation.  That was just rude!  \nYou could encourage him to get good grades and apply for scholarships.  You could encourage him to get a PT job and save up money.  You could explain the difference in the family dynamic between he and his step sister.  But you don't say \"thems the breaks\"", "YTA. You\u2019re not wrong, but you were an AH on how you expressed yourself.

You were completely honest with Nick, even if \"thems the breaks\" isn't how I would've worded it.  \n\n\nThe truth is, the situation *isn't* fair to Nick, but as we all know, life is rarely fair.

But he's going to be upset about it. It's just a tough place to be in. Hang in there. Keep reminding your stepson that you and your husband will financially support him to the best of your ability, but you just don't have the same money as your ex. You two aren't living this lavish life either. It's not like you're choosing a vacation in Europe over his education or anything, but he's a kid. It isn't fair, but life isn't fair. It's a major life lesson to him now, and to me, as a mom as well, this is the hill to die on. It's a MAJOR life lesson SO MANY parents don't want to teach their kids these days.

I think recognizing and focusing more on the fact that you are legally obligated to pay your portion, per parenting agreement, but you and your husband did the best you could to save for him. \n\nI also agree with other posters that the fact he will have any paid for is better than a lot of ppl. My parents weren't able to contribute to my college, and I won't be able to contribute to my kid's college. I will support them by letting them live with me rent free and trying to help financially where I can.

He's just your son at this point.\n\nOthers gave you good advice on how better to phrase it...obviously being flip and cruel in that moment was an AH thing to do. If you were trying to explain their individual situations, you did a poor job of it by making your son feel so hurt.

And I cannot imagine how hard this must be from your side. But I was in Nick's shoes. You need to be really compassionate with him. This is the start of him having to work through the fact that he is most likely going to spend his entire life having to work significantly harder to get the same opportunities he gets to watch your daughter have. And even then he probably wont be allowed many of them no matter how hard he works. That's a hard thing to deal with as a kid. In reality, its pretty bullshit, and the fact that its so unbalanced is honestly something he has a right to be upset about. Its not your fault the systems fucked up though.\n\nAlso. FWIW. if you and your ex are amicable....it shouldn't hurt to ask to change the agreement.

And everyone I know went to state schools. I and most of them ended up with PhDs, and make six figures. Make the most of what schools you have access to!  because the school is not what matters!!!!  It is what you DO with the education available. Please DO sit down with BOTH kids, and discuss what they think they woudl be able to do- not just what they WANT to do, with the programs they are considering.  All of education is too expensive to dink around and end up with no plan to make it pay itself back (and pretty much every education CAN pay for itself over time- but you have to have a plan to make that happen). \n\nExample- if you are into art, do you get an art degree?  Ok, what are you going to be able to DO with that?  How about taking some business courses, so you can work as a art curator for a Fortune 500, or take art as a minor and biology or engineering as a major (or double majors), and apply your art interests in unique ways, like through UI/UX design for software or devices? Or be able to develop art for texts books or scientific journals. \n\nOr if you are interested in psychology- HAVE A PLAN to get a graduate degree, or take enough biology/medical classes to compete as a clinical trials staff in Pharma or device.  If you want to be a therapist, pay attention to cost benefit. PhD in Clinical Psych are 6 yr, expensive and focus on the research of therapeutic applications.  If that is your thing, cool- if you really just want to be a therapist, then look into LCSW- 2 yr and more effective therapeutic training. \n\nThose are just a few of the examples I have personal knowledge of- but talk to your networks- and your Ex has a great network I am sure, and sounds like he is kind- he would be a great resource for Nick to tap into in thinking about multiple paths for what they decide on for their education path (basically have some ideas other than \"get a job doing exactly X\"- most degrees do not actually give you that.

I share Catie with her father (my ex-husband) Will (52M), but have been married to my husband Brian (49M) for about 6 years. Brian has a son Nick (16) who is a junior at the same school as Catie. Brian has full custody of Nick while I share custody of Catie. \n\nWill and I divorced fairly amicably when Catie was young, and have grown into strong coparents. Will\u2019s family comes from substantial money, so as part of the divorce we agreed that he would be responsible for the tuition and dorm bill for Catie\u2019s college, and I would pay for the other miscellaneous living expenses. I have saved enough to pay for these expenses, but I know that if something were to happen to my savings, Will or his family would be able to foot the entire bill for Catie\u2019s living expenses without any changes to his lifestyle. \n\nWill and I decided to sit Catie down and show her the whole picture of what college costs and what we will pay for. Brian thought it would be a good idea to have a similar conversation with Nick even though he is only a junior. \n\nUnfortunately, the financial situation for Nick differs. Since his mother is not in the picture, it has been on Brian to save for Nick\u2019s college. Brian was able to save and I have also contributed a bit, and he has about enough saved for a full associates degree or half bachelors degree at an in-state public school without living expenses.\n\nWe didn\u2019t openly discuss the specifics of the different finances with each child, but did broadly say that they had different opportunities due to situations outside of their control. Nick has since surmised that his situation is very different from Catie\u2019s and his choices will be much more impacted by finances than hers.\n\nNick came to Brian and I very upset over the weekend. He said that It wasn\u2019t fair that Catie got to go anywhere she wanted and he specifically was upset that Catie would not have to pay for her own room and board. He then asked that if Catie gets into a school with scholarships, if he could get the difference in tuition for his college. Or, he said that I should contribute the savings I had for Catie to his fund to try and make it more fair since Will could make up the difference easily. I kindly told him that no, I wouldn\u2019t do that and that I\u2019m really sorry that the situation. Then I told him that unfortunately, sometimes \u201cthems the breaks\u201d in life and that we will do our best to make sure that whatever college he decides to go to that he can make the most of the opportunity even with loans. \n\nNick was obviously upset at this and Brian thinks my response to his asking made me a bit of an asshole even though I shouldn\u2019t have to change any of the agreement. I feel like I\u2019m going crazy but AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Nick has benefited from this before as well - his first phone actually was another one Will gave us when he upgraded. We have tried to be as fair as possible about other things growing up from our end but this is definitely the biggest source of inequality between siblings since we got married.", "The tone of the post also feels like OP doesn't care about her stepson at all, even since she's been in his life since ten.

He would never have access to that money anyways.\n\nIt was a bit blunt and forward but this is life. Life won't coddle you so it's best to say it once and for all without sugarcoating it.

We live about 15 minutes from a good public college and he knows he can live here for free if that is the path he chooses. However, at the end of the conversation I did use the exact phrase in the title to try and make part of the conversation more broadly about how opportunities are just sometimes unequal and it sucks - but I\u2019m very willing to apologize for that since it sounds like most people agree that was not well executed", "He\u2019s not her son.

The problem is that per the divorce agreement my savings for Catie is for things like rent off campus, textbooks, groceries, study abroad, school activities, etc. Her father is the one covering tuition, so he\u2019d primarily be the one who would benefit if Catie receives merit scholarships.

It might have been harsh if you used the exact phrase \"thems the breaks\" but I got the feeling you were paraphrasing.\n\nWhen I was in your stepson's position, I think I would have come around if after the \"life is hard and theres no money for college\" talk, my parents had a brief followup and told me that they're sorry for the difficulties I face, and whenever I'm ready to talk about it, they'll help me develop a plan to best use what finances are available and make sure I have the best chances at success going forwards - whatever that may look like, be it community college, trade school, working for a few years to save up, etc. and offering him counseling to work through how he's feeling because its valid to feel bad about the information he just received. \n\nIf you have any questions for me about my experience with community college, transferring, loans, whatever- feel free to DM me and Im happy to share my experience to try and help!", "No, I'd already replied to OP. That reply was just for you. You effectively said that OP wasn't in the wrong wrong because they were teaching their kid that life is tougher for some than others. \n\nI was simply using excess to point that there are many different ways to tell someone that life is hard, but the delivery is just as important as the message.\n\nImmediately prior is pretty self explanatory, it means just before. I can elaborate if you need further explanation.", "Sounds like you need to have a loving come to Jesus talk about what he can afford and don\u2019t be flippant this time. (A 10 minute conversation isn\u2019t nearly long enough for him to understand all the ramifications of his different choices. This isn\u2019t a one conversation and done issue. It should be many and they should happen a lot over the next year.) If he doesn\u2019t have the grades then it\u2019s an in-state college. As his parents it is your responsibility to tell him he cannot go to those schools. Honestly, I outright forbade my daughters from getting student loans. Told them that we wouldn\u2019t co-sign or help them in any way, if they wanted to get loans. Student loans are highly predatory (similar to pay-day-loans). As a parent, it is my responsibility to protect my kids from making huge and devastating decisions like that, and it\u2019s yours too. Also he could join the military. OR join the JROTC for the next 2 years and try for a ROTC scholarship, but that requires military service after graduation. Usually 3-4 years of service per year paid. If he isn\u2019t mature enough to understand why his step-sister has different opportunities than he does and to not be resentful, enlisting would probably be a good idea before college. It\u2019s only a few years and kids grow up a lot during that time. My husband went to a private military high school and then straight to college. He has always said that he regrets not enlisting before college, as he would have done better in school and all his classmates who were prior service were always top of the class\u2026IJS.", "Thank you, very helpful", "If you think she had to say \"thems the breaks\" that is certainly an opinion. It doesn't have much to do with your original comment though, which is what I was specifically responding to.", "Yeah for sure, I mean by comparison to his step-sister. He still has a better life than most.", "Yeah you are the second person to comment this, and I personally thought it was obviously a comparison to his step-sister and not everyone else in the world, because this can clearly be worse.\n\nSo I will go ahead and add another edit for clarification for people having a hard time with this.", "It\u2019s his step mom. His bio parents are the ones to have a college fund for their kid. Many families don\u2019t have this.", "That literally happened to my brother because I got a full scholarship and he didn\u2019t. My parents told him that\u2019s life in the big city, and he got a job and worked his way through school with some breaks to work and save. It does suck, but it\u2019s not her fault and life isn\u2019t fair", "And Nick can do the same, if he wants to make the sacrifice. Scholarships, community college, 2 more years living at home and going to a college near by, part time jobs. He just can\u2019t go to his dream school debt free. Which sucks. But it\u2019s a choice a lot of people have to make to save on loans. And yes, for A LOT of people, having parents who have a college fund at all and have promised to help as much as they can and provide a safe, stable place you can stay while you study IS a charmed life", "If they have enough to cover an associates or half a bachelors, he can work during those years and come out with very little debt.", "Is her ex supposed to pay for her stepchild's tuition? That would be ridiculous. She has set aside money for both of them, so him wanting to take his stepsister's money is selfish because that is still basically asking his stepmom's ex for money. The situation may be unfortunate but \"thems the breaks\" is technically the truth, even if it could be communicated more nicely.", "Didn\u2019t matter - being terminal doesn\u2019t apply here. It\u2019s about  OPs post. No need to further explain. You make no sense , immediately prior to this response.", "You forbade loans, which is your right as a parent. We are not going to forbid anything out right - I do genuinely believe that there may be scenarios where a loan IS the right move so long as you go in with your eyes open. He did have this discussion about what he can afford with Brian, which was at least an hour - this was just the follow up conversation to that discussion that included me that was shorter. It ended quicker because he was upset but you\u2019re right that more follow up is necessary.", "Crabs in a bucket mentality here.", "I love this implicit assumption that all degrees and all schools are exactly the same.", "Yeah, she could have shown a bit more compassion but sometimes you just say shit because you don't know how else to say it. What can you say, how else can you word this where it's going to make a difference? This is literally a \"thems the breaks\" situation.\n\nDo you baby him instead? Do you bullshit him? Like what is the right answer here? The kid is asking for his step-sister's money that was saved for her because her Dad is well off? That's not right, he's not entitled to it, and while it sucks he doesn't get that wealth advantage that is what it is.", "Lol username is so accurate", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Good first attempt", "Well, good luck to you all. I hope he doesn\u2019t sign up for student loans \u201cwith his eyes wide open\u201d only to regret it later\u2026. It\u2019s not really reasonable to expect an 18 year old who has never been financially responsible for themselves, by themselves, to understand what they are getting into. Also, are you aware that if your husband co-signs his son\u2019s student loans and (god forbid) he die, that loan usually comes due immediately? Just FYI, as a lot of people don\u2019t realize that.", "That's not true though. My stepfather was very empathetic, still is and it was a common phrase in our home. There were times that reality just couldn't be changed and I was refusing to accept the situation, that's what he would say it. OP didn't default to that, nor did my step dad. It was usually after the 3rd or 4th time he'd tried to explain something. OP's edit confirms there was some lead up to all of this. \n\nIt's not that he liked the situation at hand, but sometimes you do have to work with what you've got. It's not always said harshly. It was a kindness in a lot of ways. I didn't leave home thinking that everything would be fair or work out in my favor, because, spoiler alert, it won't. I often fared way better emotionally because my expectations were more aligned with reality.", "I dunno...I am wondering if there is a pattern of entitlement to step sisters family money and op is just DONE with that conversation.\n\nIt feels like this is just the latest in a string of \"waaaaa, it's not fair\"\n\nHaving trouble coming up with a verdict because of that.", "Or too many entitled people who need to be rocked to bed every night to sleep.", "She could have said \"that's how the cookie crumbles\"", "She's been raising this kid as her son for 6 years, maybe she could sympathize with him a little and then try to focus on solutions and positive outlooks? If your kid's in a bad way due to circumstances you acknowledge are out of their control and you say \"sucks to be you\" you're an asshole. YTA.\n\nLike spoiler alert, acting like an asshole to your son when he's stressing about his future makes you an asshole even if he's \"not entitled\" to whatever", "You are the only person on the planet that doesn\u2019t see the sarcasm in that before urgent post. Word genius you are. I feel dumber having this interaction with you.", "It seems like that is what they did originally and he wasn't dropping it. She didn't say sucks to be you. She said \"thems the breaks\" which just means that sometimes that is how things are. It doesn't mean that it sucks to be him or that he's shitty or less deserving or anything.\n\nSometimes shit just isn't fair. I don't know, maybe it's because I grew up with things not being great a lot and \"thems the breaks\" that it just doesn't seem like such a criminal act to tell a 16 year old that.\n\nIt's not mean or malicious and the intent you're putting behind it is wild to me.  Sometimes things are what they are. It is what it is. That's how the cookie crumbles.\n\nI get that it sucks to hear but sometimes that's just reality. It's not like she put him out in the yard and cut off all contact. It's not like she refuses to talk to him. It's not like they aren't still going to pay for things. He's still got great advantages with some of it being paid for. He doesn't have as much of an advantage of his step sister and they talked to him about that and he wanted more, he wanted what was his step-sisters and was it blunt? Sure. Bit he's also not a baby. I don't think he's irrevocably damaged from being told \"thems the breaks.\"\n\nAn if he is, if this one singular line defines the entire relationship between him and his step-mother from here on out then fuck, I don't know, that seems nuts to me. I'm not saying it was the best thing to say in the whole world but I don't think she was an asshole for it either.", "How could you feel dumber? I taught you at least two new words.\n\nI'm honestly surprised that somebody who doesn't know what prior means would be able to spell the word sarcasm, let alone use it in a sentence. Well done, you.", "Sounds like they already had that part of the conversation and he continued to push. \n\nThe money is not the OPs to decide where it is spent. The boy thinks he entitled to someone else's money because \"not fair\".", "This is not a catastrophic life tragedy. Many people don\u2019t have wealthy parents.", "I wrote this before the edit I think, it's clear now that \"them's the breaks\" wasn't the full extent of the conversation. And I agree, the kid is not in the worst spot. He's gonna be fine even if he goes to a cc for a couple years. I was.\n\nBut bluntness is not a self-justifying or some kind of virtue. Let's go through the archives and see how blunt tell-it-like-it-is people are consistently received. Kids and teens deserve straightforwardness and honesty. They are also in the process of developing and have less experience handling emotional situations. Communication with them in difficult situations should reflect that fact. Honestly saying \"them's the breaks\" even to an adult is not really ever constructive.\n\nFor the rest, no I don't think he's irrevocably damaged. That's not the standard for what constitutes an asshole though. She sounds like a solid parent who could be doing a whole lot worse but that doesn't change the question here.\n\ntldr; does this single interaction define their relationship? no. will it destroy this kid? no. could things have been worse? yes. But I don't think she's gotta be satan in the flesh to be an asshole in this situation. She said something she shouldn't, maybe out of exasperation, and it made her sound like an asshole. In the end it sounds like they're gonna work it all out like they should, by talking about it.", "No you didn\u2019t."]}
