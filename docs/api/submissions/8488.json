I wonder how your boss would've spoken to someone else they weren't friends with?  The issue he also has is that others in the workplace know you are friends so doesn't want to be seen as letting you have extra that others don't get.

I\u2019m one of two people who can do my job. I\u2019m not saying the company would collapse if I was fired, but I\u2019m a pretty integral part. It would be a big set back. Unless the company expands into an empire, no one is going to learn the software except us. Odds are, it will probably be obsolete by something in the future, but for now, I am pretty vital. I\u2019m not just being arrogant or grandiose, 1,000\u2019s of hours went into all of it", "One day you will leave the company and then you will find out if what you\u2019re saying is true\u2026I have no idea why you don\u2019t think anyone can learn what you do but they will find a way\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re good at your job but you just admitted that your company would not go under if you left\u2026company\u2019s face setbacks all the time and then they get thru it\u2026your company will be the same", "Yeah, and nobody wants to own a business and be held over a barrel by any employee, period. So no matter how important you are, when push comes to shove, if you refuse to follow basic protocol or make your boss look foolish, incompetent, or weak, he WILL find an alternative to keeping someone like you around. \n\nWhy? Because he has to think about the long-term future of his entire company, not short-term setbacks like the loss of someone who was once an integral employee or the one-person salary increase needed to cover your loss.YTA, and an entitled AH at that.", "It is true. Even if someone made software that pretty much operated the exact same way as ours, it\u2019s still all coded in a unique way. They wouldn\u2019t know how to debug anything on ours. Even if you\u2019re an experienced programmer, you\u2019re not going to learn 10,000\u2019s of lines of code, and have all the key spots memorized. Sometimes it\u2019s even hard for me. It\u2019s all built off a system we came up, and expanded upon, and expanded upon endlessly. \n\nThere\u2019s a reason why Y2K cost billions for companies to fix. All the young programmers had no idea how those codes were programmed, if they did, they wouldn\u2019t have had to pay all the old programmers insane salaries and overtime to come back and work on it. You also have to find someone willing to teach someone a software, and someone willing to learn. I wouldn\u2019t do it unless I was being paid an insane amount of money", "You keep saying it\u2019s true but then you provide the examples as to why it\u2019s not\n\nY2K happened and guess what\u2026we all survived even if they did have to pay a lot\n\nIf your boss fires you (which once again no one is even saying is going to happen) then he must be aware of the fact that he will have to shell out big money to replace you\n\nSomeone else on your team also knows it as you said and can help the new hire learn\n\nSupposedly indispensable people leave companies all the time and they find people to replace them\n\nIf you were able to do it from scratch I guarantee  you there is someone else who can learn it as well\n\nAnd if they can\u2019t then your boss would just hire a consulting team to overhaul the entire process\n\nI mean you do you im clearly not going to change your mind but you\u2019re own arguments undermine the point you\u2019re trying to make"]}
