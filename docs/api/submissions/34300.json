She was not tagged or anything, she called herself out.", "NTA. At most it was a little passive aggressive. Maybe it served as as a reminder to someone else who needed to see it.\n\nMy first thought was you should have just called her out & put a stop to it then and there. BUT her strong response to something fairly vague leads me to believe that she was using it willfully,, maybe even from a hateful standpoint (vs an uneducated/old-school one) and that it would have just turned into a full blown in person argument. In this case keeping quiet was probably the right thing.", "NTA \n\nAlthough you probably should have pulled her aside and told her in person, I see nothing wrong with what you did. You didn't tag her, so there was no \"call out\".", "NTA\n\nShes guilty & she knows it! Thats on her not on you!", "Info: Why didn\u2019t you feel comfortable enough to talk to your SIL in person when the event actually happened? \n\nInstead you vague-posted about her, knowing she\u2019d know it was directed at her. \n\nYou basically showed your kids you won\u2019t defend them and you\u2019ll only do it later?", "ESH - You let your kid down by not directly speaking to her and just hoping she saw your passive aggressive post.", "NTA, but it would have been better to just talk to her, now it was a bit passive aggressive.", "NTA. You didn't call her out, but it was passive aggressive. Honestly, you should have called her out to her face when she said it.", "YTA-don\u2019t be passive aggressive. Just tell her.", "Using FB to passive aggressively get your point across is weak AF. \n\nYTA for what you asked.

That why she's claiming g you called her out", "NTA lol so all that happened here is that you kept the peace, and she knew she had done the wrong thing and then got all defensive when she felt called out. \n\nYou're NTA", "The family knows I'm opposite of most of their beliefs. And some tend to bring it up around me when I'd rather just enjoy the holidays. I really don't want to argue or ruin a get-together. And i feel like I'd be the one blamed because I'm the in-law. \n\nI don't think she used it because we were there. I think she used it because it's a word she uses so regularly in her normal speech, that she didn't realize it would offend anyone. Which is a problem. And also why I felt like I should share the post. Anyone else in the family or on my friends list could also read it and understand my thoughts on it.", "No, she showed her kid how to maintain self control and how to not ruin a holiday.", "She's never really liked me. And we were at her house. The family is very tight-knit. I'm also neurodivergent and do not like conflict. I explained to my daughter later that we can't always control what other people say, and I was sorry she had to hear that word. I wouldn't say I don't defend my children. Because I'm a pretty protective mama bear. It was just very different in that moment. I was very unsure of how to react and very uncomfortable. I could kind of feel some panic brewing. So I figured I'd bring it up to my husband later and see how he wanted to handle it.", "It's not okay to use slurs on yourself when they aren't slurs you can reclaim.", "Why hasn\u2019t your husband done anything about his family?", "Your husband should have been the one to confront her.", "It's a phrase many people grew up using on themselves. Nobody claims anything. Freedom of speech (even if it is ignorant). You address differences directly, not by posting hints on social media.", "NTA but confront her now", "NTA.  The only way you could be is to have the poor judgment to continue to have anything to do with her in the future.  \nYou know how the more sensitive people are always saying something like, \"If you see something, say something.\"  IOW, if you're in an elevator or a work meeting, and someone says something racist, don't let it pass.  Well, likewise, you mustn't let her behavior pass.  \n   \nAnd I'm talking about the entirety of her behavior.  \nThe initial offense of using that word was bad enough.   But what really sealed the deal and fastened the lock, was when she got pissed about being called on it, instead of being sensitive and responsive about her error.  \n   \nAnd your husband had damn well better stand behind you on this, or he too has serious attitude problems,\nabout his own children.  You just tell him, that you can make kissy-face with your SIL once she gives you (AND whatever child heard her) even a trace of apology, and understands and acknowledges her error, and agrees to do better in future.  Anything less means she feels free to continue in the future, and other people might take after her example.", "NTA and honestly its a shame your kiddo didnt say \"mom we don't use that word\" loud enough for everyone to hear.\n\nThen a real discussion could have been had. Being \"called out\" by a child hits a lot harder that being done by another adult", "NTA, maybe not the best way to go about it but direct confrontation can be hard for some people.\n\nI HATE that word because though I can more or less pass as neurotypical now I spent several months a couple of years back completely non-responsive after a trauma that left me with PTSD. Which is basically the clinical definition of that word. \n\nIt is a part of my life that really scares me, I have very few conscious memories of late 2020 to late 2021. And that word really makes me think of that time I lost."]}
