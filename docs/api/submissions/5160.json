I rarely if ever even *think* about high school unprompted. Why would I? I graduated in 2009. My life has changed *drastically* since I was that awkward kid. I've experience the real world, not just living with mom and dad and mooching a nepotism job while endlessly rehashing stories from half a life ago about a bunch of people who, if they even remember me to begin with, haven't thought about me since half a lifetime ago.  \n\nI get being insecure about that. He could do something about it, but instead he's shit talking a high schooler to make himself feel big. It makes sense, he hasn't matured any since then so I guess that's the only way he knows how to behave, like a teenager in the body of a man soon reaching middle age.  \n\nThis could be his chance to finally grow the fuck up, otherwise in 25 years he'll be the pathetic man in his 50s telling Noelle's high school aged children how much cooler than them and their mother he was in high school, 40 years prior and before anyone he's belittling to feel important were even born.", "I have a 15 year old daughter.  She doesn't have a boyfriend.  I know at least two boys asked her out, but she told the first one she didn't think she was old enough to date (14 at the time) and told the second one that she didn't feel about him that way.\n\nThere might have been others who asked her out, but I wouldn't know.  I only know about those two because other people told me.  My daughter has said to me she doesn't think she will bother dating until after high school (two more years).  She is very academically inclined and really wants to do well.\n\nI am so proud of this kid that I could burst!  She doesn't feel the need to fit in with a social scene, doesn't conform to social norms of 'must have a partner', and knows what she wants and what she needs to do to achieve it.\n\nNoelle sounds very similar.  What an amazing kid!", "NTA. \n\nIan wants to act superior and an a\\*\\* to his daughter in public, then he needs to be called out in public.  \n\nYour mother is an enabler.", "NTA, Ian is though. I\u2019ll never understand why fully grown adults think it\u2019s okay to bully teenagers/kids. It\u2019s gross. GROW UP. He sounds like he needs to get hit with a reality check and the parents need to put some distance. He needs to get on his own two feet and experience real adulthood, it sounds to me like they\u2019re babying him and encouraging him to be more codependent. As a parent I understand wanting to help your kids but when they get to a certain age, you have to give tough love, otherwise once both parents are gone, Ian is not going to know how to function or make money on his own. Independence is key to becoming an adult and it seems like he didn\u2019t grasp this.", "NTA and tbh the thing is his insecurity was relevant to why he was being an asshole, the motivation there is fairly clear. It wasn't some random unrelated insecurity even, making is entirely appropriate to bring it up", "NTA and if your mom keeps at it tell her if she had parented your brother better maybe he wouldn't have turned into such an asshole who needs to bully kids to feel better about himself.", "NTA and your Mom \"mommying\" him is why he is so entitled.", "NTA.\n\nTwo wrongs may not make a right, but a taste of his own medicine certainly shut your bullying brother up, didn't it?\n\nYour mom seems fond of common idioms - have you suggested \"don't dish it out if you can't take it\" and \"don't start nothing, won't be nothing\" as handy additions to her arsenal of parental wisdom? Maybe she could practice them on Ian.", "Absolutely NTA.  The fact that everyone except your mother agrees should be evidence of that in itself.  You are an awesome aunt for standing up for your niece.  Everyone is insecure anyways but especially teenage girls, and the last thing she needs is someone, especially a family member, saying that kind of stuff to her. As for your mother saying that you could have stood up for her without throwing his insecurities in his face, you did do that and he wasn't stopping.  You state you kept telling him to stop and yet he persisted.  If he wasn't going to respond to anything else, you really had no choice in the matter.  So ignore your mom, she's just annoyed she has to deal with a pouty Ian, and go treat yourself and your niece to an ice cream or something", "NTA.  You are never, ever TA for defending a kid.  You did nothing wrong.  Your mom would rather see her granddaughter ripped to shreds by her disgusting son than face the fact that her son is a ne'er-do-well bully.  When you defended Nicole, she had to look at reality.  She didn't like reality and neither did Ian.  It's hard to decide which of them gets the A crown, but I'm pretty sure it's Ian.", "Ian's mommy needs to cut him off the tit. He is the AH here. And OP was 100% in the right. Kudos to them!", "[removed]", "NTA Ian is clearly that guy who still wears his highschool jacket as an adult hangs around his own highhool trying to pick up girls and befriend highschoolers. \n\nHopefully your comments are the kick in the ass he needs.", "NTA. He sounds like Uncle Rico from Napoleon Dynamite. Maybe for the holidays you can buy him a Time Machine off of the internet and he can go back to his glory days, \n\nI think it would be 100% acceptable for you and your niece to laugh at him behind his back.", "NTA.  He's _so_ insecure about it, it's all he can talk about, huh?\n\nYou told him to knock it off.  He chose not to.  You told him multiple times.  He still didn't get the hint.\n\nHe doesn't get to rag on a _child_ because he, well, peaked in high school.", "Mom is a giant AH too for enabling Ian. They both need the umbilical cut.", "Mom needs a wake up call. Or Ian will continue to live in the basement.", "This! \u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f", "I disagree. If Ian is an AH, so is OP. Is OP's reaction understandable? Yes. Is it justified? That's subjective, but I would say no. Just what example is OP trying to set for her niece?\n\nI'm with OP's mom, ESH.", "Al did more with his life then Ian\n\nIan never even left home !", "Ian isn\u2019t the dad, he\u2019s the uncle.

Likable, and not lazy, but just incredibly incompetent.  Give him a toy hammer instead of a real one to minimize the damage.  The dad wanted to retire and transfer the business to someone else who would keep it going successfully, and he knew it wouldn't be the son.  However, the owner's wife threatened the owner with divorce and financial ruin if he didn't turn over the business to his son.  That was 20 years ago.  I left before it came to a head, so I don't know how it all turned out.", "What example is she setting for her niece? Don't let anyone, family or not talk shit to you. \n\nTbh OP shouldn't have had to say anything, her sister should have shut Ian RIGHT down. I sure as hell would have", "Except Ian's high school buddies left him long ago except in his mind.", "She's teaching her niece to be like OP's brother: hostile. She's rewarding that behavior by not only encouraging it, but also exemplifying it\n\nThe fact that you would also have made a mistake does not excuse it.", "Doubt the dad would be that stupid if he's sincere about his son being a crappy employee... chances are he's for a ride awakening once his dad passed cause I don't think his wife will have access to the company decision making either.", "Sorry, I'm not a pacifist. I'm also sure as hell not going to stand there while my adult loser brother tells my child how to live her life. \n\nThe fact that you think standing up for a child is a mistake shows you don't understand parenting. \n\nWe have nothing else to discuss. \n\nPeace", "Honestly 3 good friends in high school can be a lot more meaningful than 20 hangers on.\n\nI reckon those friendships the niece has is more likely to survive them growing up because it will be more likely based on genuine connection over just having fun.\n\nNot necessarily and it's fine if they drift apart, but my experience is that small friendship groups are often more resilient than large ones.\n\nIt's a stupid thing for an adult to compete with a child about, either way.", "Well, I am, on the whole, a pacifist and I agree with you. There comes a point pacifism becomes harmful, and a precision strike is exactly what's needed to stop further hostilities", "Standing up for a child is not the mistake, deliberately insulting a family member is. There are other ways to defend the niece without mirroring the brother's behavior\n\nYou are devolving the discussion into an uncivil argument. This is exactly what I'm talking about", "Agree completely.\n\nGood point.", "If I read correctly she had already tried to tell him to lay off her without directly insulting him. That didn't work and he kept at it. So she resorted to what did work to stop him from bullying a child.\n\nOP tried the peaceful route first.
