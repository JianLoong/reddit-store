He had the mentality that he and his friend group were going to be best friends forever and hang out all the time even as adults. After graduation, his friends moved on to jobs and college. They communicate maybe once a year at most now.\n\nIan is still living in the past. He tries to center almost every conversation around the \u201cglory days\u201d of high school. Things like \u201cWhen Jessy and I dated, we went out every night!\u201d or \u201cHah, that guy looks just like that fatass, Davey!\u201d or \u201cThat dress looks like something that slut Sarah would wear!\u201d and other classmates who he hasn\u2019t actually seen in almost 15 years. Ian refuses to move on. He lives with our parents and works at their business. He\u2019s an extremely lazy worker and my father admitted to me once that if Ian weren\u2019t his son he would have fired Ian a long time ago.\n\nWe were at Jacob\u2019s house last weekend for my nephew\u2019s birthday party. The younger kids were playing games in the living room and I was in the den with a few other people (including Ian) talking to Emilia\u2019s daughter Noelle (15F.) Noelle is a great kid. She gets good grades and volunteers at a local nature center. Ian asked Noelle how many friends she has and Noelle explained that she has three close friends who she usually hangs out with and some other people who she talks to as well.\n\nIan made a comment how \u201cThat\u2019s it? When I was your age, I had at least twenty friends who hung out with me every day.\u201d Ian then started criticizing Noelle for not having a boyfriend because \u201cwhen I was a sophomore I\u2019d already had a dozen girlfriends.\u201d I kept telling Ian to stop, Noelle\u2019s a great kid, and he\u2019s being a jerk for no reason. Ian made a comment about how Noelle was a loser and accused her of only having good grades because \u201cyou have nothing better to do. You barely have any friends.\u201d\n\nThat was enough for me. I told Ian \u201cHey, Ian, we all get that you peaked in high school and you're insecure about it. But don\u2019t try to put down Noelle when she\u2019s already more successful than you.\u201d Ian was furious and embarrassed and ended up leaving early. Almost all of the family agrees with what I said because it was in defense of Noelle and Ian was out of line by essentially bullying a teenager. \n\nBut my mother told me that what I told Ian took it too far and that I disrupted my nephew\u2019s party by making Ian mad. I pointed out that all the kids were in the living room and none of them were in the den when I told Ian off. If the party was disrupted, it was because Ian chose to cause a scene. My mother told me that while Ian was wrong to say what he did about Noelle and she scolded him about it, I could have still stood up for her without throwing something that I know Ian is insecure about in his face and that two wrongs don\u2019t make a right.

Your parents are coddling him and not allowing to grow up. Your dad should fire him so that he can realize that he has to actually work to succeed and that people won't always have a safety blanket for him to protect him from reality. Your mom is enabling him and thinking he's still a kid when he's a grown adult not man because he never matured.", "NTA\n\nYour brother was making fun of his NIECE. Might your comment have been mean and hurtful to Ian? No doubt\n\nDid he deserve it for mocking his niece? 100%", "NTA. You're kind of a hero. Teenage girls' self esteem can be so fragile. Hopefully Noelle realizes that she's just fine as she is and that her uncle is a moron.", "NTA\n\nLmao at mom. Now we know why he is the way he is.", "NTA \n\nYour brother was being an A hole to a child, you stood up for the child.\n\nIf he was back in high school and this was a movie people who have stood up and slow clapped.  \n\n( I also grew up in the 90's lol)", "NTA it sounds like everyone coddles him so he needed a wake up call", "NTA.\n\nYour niece needed to hear that, whether she said it to you or not, she needed someone to tell her that she's on a good path and is doing things right. Your brother needed to hear it too. I agree with the other commenters, your brother needs a harsh reality check. Your parents are not doing him favors by treating him like he's in high school (letting him live at home with a guaranteed job at dad's work that he hasn't earned).", "NTA \n\nIan deserves it honestly, and he shouldn't have called out your niece like that. Thank you for being the only one to stand up for her, especially since teens are very insecure around that age.", "Peak NTA, that was a game winning goal, thanks for the dopamine!", "NTA Ian ruined the party, not you. A grown man bullying a teenager. Good for you for defending her.", "NTA.  And it's not like Ian scored four touchdowns in one game for Polk High School...", "NTA\n\nIan is 33 for god\u2019s sake.

Put him in his place! I hope you follow up as good sister though. He is probably alone and doesn't know what to do.

You gave him back what he was putting out.", "NTA somebody needed to say it but your mom sounds like an enabler.", "It sounds like your Mom may contribute to why Ian is the way he is. You did nothing wrong, and ideally she'd have been the one addressing the bullying of her granddaughter by her son. \n\nYou stepped up. Good on you. NTA.", "NTA, OP. \n\nSometimes, a well-placed clap-back is exactly what is needed. \n\nYou could also start calling him \"Al\" or \"Bundy\" as that TV character, too, peaked in high school.", "NTA. Ian needs a reality check. 33 is far too old to still be caring that much about high school, he needs to get a life and grow up.", "NTA, it\u2019s true he has been wasting fifteen years of his adult like because he can\u2019t get his head around that there is life after high school. If Noelle is happy, and Emilia is happy and as long as no one is getting hurt that\u2019s all that matters and it\u2019s not Ian\u2019s place to pass comment.\n\nIan needs forward direction, and he can start by improving his job performance so he\u2019s got at least a good reference as well as skills to carry him forward on a CV and for other job applications. Some basic finance management skills too if he doesn\u2019t have them. If he can get a qualification, all the better but the longer he leaves it the harder it will be.", "NTA, and thank you for doing what you did. \n\nWhen I was a teenager lady, I was basically a lightning rod for insecure men. The worst of them were my uncle's, who bullied me without ever being called out for it. In my grandma's eyes, they also could do no wrong.

Sounds like going \"over the top\" here just saves future arguments.", "NTA Ian was bullying your niece whose 15yrs old compared to his 33yrs. Noelle doesn't need to be bullied by her insecure uncle whose jealous of her, and no doubt she's extremely grateful that her aunt was there and not on,y stood up for her, but also put her uncle in his place. This not only shows her who has her back, but also shows her, that her family will stand up against her bully.\n\nAs for Ian it sounds as though he's been coddled for far too long and it's time for him to grow up and learn to be independent and start standing on his own 2 feet, starting with both a new place to live and a huge dose of reality when he's fired by your father.\n\nI'd also be getting your other siblings together and have a meeting with your parents and calmly and firmly state that they are doing Ian more harm than good, because none of you will be picking up the slack when they are gone, and Ian will not be welcome to live with any of you, and nor will you all be tolerating any of his BS moving forward.
