Good on you for defending your baby.", "NTA Sil overstepped extremely and dangerously. Did she even know if little one could swim? No she didn't and she risked her life. I would definitely stop the conversation next time so little one doesn't feel uncomfortable or pressured. It's ridiculous how some adults just don't know when to quit.", "NTA\n\nI get where its seems messed up to make them pay after inviting them, but you made it their choice. \n\nYou either mind your own business and stop trying to parent my child or you get a free vacation. \n\nYou're not making them pay, at this point, it's her choice to do so, she may feel that she's so confident in her decision that it's worth a 10k vacation.\n\nAlso as a child that was thrown in the deep end and dragged on roller coasters against their will, I applaud you Op for taking a stand.", "NTA - She should be grateful she got a warning!", "ESH You can\u2019t punish SIL monetarily for abusing your child (though I get why you would want to).

My eldest never a plroblem at the beach, loves rolling in the sand, was never scared of the water. Rinse and repeat with the second, right? NO! My youngest is stubborn (love this most of the time) and would not want to step a toe in the water. It took frequent, gentle exposure, at her pace and time to process the beach with all the different textures, sounds, water and waves.\n\nMy youngest is fine swimming in a pool and the bath, so not scared of water but it wasn't until the summer of 2022 (aged 3yrs) that she would be more adventurous at the beach and not Act scared of the beach/waves. She was the same the first few times we took her to a splash park.  She now loves the beach (most of the time) and learns best watching how her older sister and friends play at the beach and then she decides if she wants to join in or not, with no pressure.\n\nYou're doing what's right for her and she needs to know you support her. SIL can take a hike - slip some algae in her shampoo bottle.", "I wouldn\u2019t have let it go to \u201cone more time and\u2026\u201d but definitely NTA. What did SIL respond? I wouldn\u2019t leave her alone with your child anymore.", "ESH. Your SIL sucks the most, she should never have done that. Awful way of acting.\n\nBut as much as her actions sucked, it's really petty to threaten not to pay for the vacation that you already took them to. That is uncalled for and won't help the situation. If you really feel angry about this, which I could imagine, just don't invite them anymore the next time. If this is the first time something like this happens and in general you're on good terms with your SIL - might be best to talk it out once you guys are all back home. If she doesn't understand or just keeps defending herself, then you know enough for the future.", "Nta, that\u2019s reasonable", "NTA!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Her reasoning is asinine. If your daughter has a fear of the water, it is not \u201cgood for her health\u201d, it\u2019s traumatic for her.

Psychologically, your daughter does not like water so forcing her into it would only damage her mentally. Your sil thought she was doing what she deemed right, by physically grabbing a child that wasn't hers without consent and tried to take her into the water while the non-consenting child screamed in terror. I'd personally make sure that somebody who would touch your child like that would never be allowed to be near them again. Think about the safety of your daughter; if she's willing to throw her screaming into the ocean, imagine what else she'd be willing to do to your daughter because she felt it was \"right\" in her twisted mind.

SIL is a free guest on this trip, and if the smack talk on financial responsibility is what brings her to her senses, so be it. If you can\u2019t afford to FAFO, adjust your conduct. I don\u2019t believe for a moment that the threat about following OP\u2019s rules means SIL can\u2019t do as she likes on her own, or parent her *own* kids her way, but it does mean she ends the disrespect and the boundary-stomping toward others. Sounds like just what she needed to hear. OP is NTA for getting her attention.", "If your judgement is NTA then you need to put spaces between the letters in Y T A like that, or the bot will count that as your judgement."]}
