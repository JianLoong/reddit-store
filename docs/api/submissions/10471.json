Which was completely fine. I had a year to figure it out and think on it so i wasn\u2019t gonna stress or even really think about it at all. well soon it turned into \u201che\u2019s moving states during spring break and i\u2019m going to go with him so you need to figure it out\u201d. okay. so now at that point in time, it\u2019s december and I have now only a few months. i figured let me at least get through Christmas and then i\u2019ll start trying to think of a plan ig. During Christmas break, it turned into \u201cwe looked at an apartment yesterday and can move in whenever. i can give you $250 every month for my half of rent\u201d. our rent is $869 total. her $250 wouldn\u2019t cover her half. i\u2019d still be responsible for my half, hers, groceries, heat, and electricity. i instantly argued in trying to get her to stay the rest of the lease. a fail. so i gave up and just wanted to be done with her at that point. i found out that if she were to break the lease i can\u2019t stay anyways so i was forced to move back home so she could go live with her boyfriend. we had a deadline of feb 19 to move out so i stayed until then. when i would get my mail, i\u2019d take only mine out and leave hers in there. she knew she had mail coming there. before i know it i got the angriest text saying it\u2019s my fault she has overdue medical bills and everything and it\u2019s my responsibility to tell her she had mail. i said \u201ci\u2019m not your personal mail man. i don\u2019t owe you anything. and you knew you had mail here so it\u2019s your responsibility to check on it.\u201d everyone\u2019s telling me i\u2019m being dramatic. i don\u2019t think i am. at all. i think i was being as respectful as i could to her considering she fucked me over so bad after i did everything i could to be there for her. not only did i lose my apartment, i lost my friend and i feel like a failure even though it\u2019s not my doing. amita?", "created_utc": 1676902200, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1177lbi/aita_for_not_telling_my_roommate_she_had_mail/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also, it would be illegal for you to open mail not addressed to you to check for bills.", "NTA. She could have had her mail forwarded. She could have changed her address with the people & companies who send her bills.

Her mail, her responsibility. It's not your fault, nor your problem that she didn't. You have enough on your own plate. \n\nAnd, if we want to get petty, she put you in a tough position for her own personal reasons, not caring how it affected you and your situation, leaving you to scramble to figure things out yourself.

It\u2019s hard to find a decent roommate. Her mail wasn\u2019t your responsibility. She was fully aware of her medical bills and could have paid them by phone.

Her prior behavior doesn\u2019t even come into play to determine this.", "NTA, she should have forwarded her mail", "NTA.  You're totally right that you aren't her secretary.  She didn't ask you to check, she didn't come check the mail herself, and she did fuck you over on living arrangements.  These are the consequences of her own actions.", "Lmao NTA!\n\nYour friend is an adult now and USPS (I'm assuming you're American but other countries' mail providers have this service too) has mail forwarding that lasts a year and it's free and easy to do.

It was petty for me to leave her mail in there, but she also would come into the apartment and take little things like all my toilet paper, or my syrup and it was just an inconvenience and annoying. I was trying to avoid all that as well. That\u2019s why i said there\u2019s so many little details that do play a huge role but I wasn\u2019t able to include them all. I asked her before all this happened if she could just lmk when she goes to the apartment since she doesn\u2019t necessarily live there and all my stuff is there and she told me \u201cI can come and go as i please\u201d.
