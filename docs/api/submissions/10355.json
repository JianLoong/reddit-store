He would have told you when he was ready to.

The individual gets to choose when and to whom they come out to. You're not entitled to that information.  Also, considering how sexist you were in this short conversation, if he is gay, then I totally understand his hesitance to come out to someone like you.", "OP please let him be for a while and allow him to reach out to you when he's ready or your ex-wife is able to speak with him about talking to you about it.  He's 15, still learning to figure himself out, and he may not actually be into labels.  This is why acronym LGBTQIA+ covers the entire spectrum, and a lot of young people these days don't care being labeled anything.  Your ex said he came out to her as gay, but that could change the next week or the next month.  This is one situation you need to bide your time on and be there when he's ready to talk again, but he may not bring it up so don't force it or you you risk pushing him further away.", "YTA. I mean, it wasn't the *worst* thing you could've said to him, but good grief, give the kid some privacy! He might not be gay, in which case your comments might've made him confused... And if he *is* gay, it's up to him to decide when to come out; you shouldn't push him. Could be that he's gay and doesn't yet know it himself. The thing to do is generally just to let your kid know that you're accepting of them no matter who they are. Along with displaying affirmative attitudes toward the LGBTQAI+ community, of course.\n\nAlso, what's with prioritizing physical appearance here?", "YTA\n\nHe should've been the one to tell you. You don't ask someone their sexual orientation, especially one that is right out of the blue.\n\nIs there a reason why you \"needed\" to know now?", "YTA but soft.\n\nThe way you went about it was not the best. Pretty bad tbh but the fact that your here asking makes me think you aren\u2019t a bad person just didn\u2019t know what to say and wanted to know so you could have \u201cconfirmation\u201d.\n\nBut look at it this way:\n\n1) when you were fifteen if your dad or mom had said \u201cso that\u2019s your girlfriend huh? What a looker\u201d you\u2019d have been embarrassed and grossed out not want to deal with that. He\u2019s a hormonal teenager. Being called out on having a significant other/having a crush is way complicated.\n\n2) it\u2019s not exactly easy being lgbtq+ - even if you think your trying to be supportive it\u2019s terrifying to think about coming out. It\u2019s even worse to be called out/outed without your control. When I was younger my parents were progressive (for the time and place) and I still was so so scared of them finding out. It meant putting all of their love to the test and I wasn\u2019t prepared to do so for a long long time. If they had outed me or pushed me I would have reacted the same way because I wouldn\u2019t have had any other way to react. I wouldn\u2019t have been ready to bet the farm on the reaction.\n\nSit down with him and apologize for what you said. Don\u2019t expect forgiveness or trust right away but just, let him heal up.

It\u2019s generally advised to make sure you are vocally positive about LGBTQ+ issues on the regular so your kid knows they will be accepted, and it\u2019s fine to say something like \u201cif you decide you\u2019re gay or bi or trans at some point, you know I\u2019ll love you the same, right?\u201d But not to put them on the spot asking them yes or no. Definitely look into a resource like PFLAG for more advice on supporting your kid.", "As a gay man, I'm going to say NAH. I don't think there's anything wrong with asking. Your son seems to be overreacting a bit, but also he's a teenager, so that's totally normal and doesn't make him the AH either.", "YTA\n\nWhy did you feel the need to force him to come out?  That is something a person needs to do on their own timeline.", "NAH.  Your son's response to your line of questioning was somewhat predictable, but of course hindsight is 20/20.  You'll know for next time that there are better, less direct, ways to show your support.  Hopefully this situation will resolve itself.  Good luck.", "Soft YTA. You had good intentions but you cornered him.", "YTA\n\nDid you ever consider that if he is gay there\u2019s a reason he hasn\u2019t told you yet? You can make it clear you\u2019re supportive of the LGBT community without pressuring him and he could have done with that information what he wanted.", "YTA \n\nFor exactly the reason your ex-wife said.  You didn't ask, you accused.  Gay stuff is a huge threat to masculinity, especially for teen boys - yes, even in our enlightened era.  \n\nYour son might be gay, but calling a teenager gay when he's struggling with the idea can easily turn into an attack on his masculinity.  From his dad, no less, that can really hurt.", "Well, this one is a tough one.  As much as it shouldn't be a big deal in an ideal world to just come out and ask, it *is* a big deal for a lot of people.  I have been right where you're at and I never came right out and asked, but my spouse did I think, not directly but kind of in a roundabout way like phrasing questions in a way that could allow him (my son) to say it himself if he wanted.  (Example: She'd ask him if there were any cute girls in school and after he answered she'd ask if there were any cute guys.  She did it in a way that he could play it off as her just being silly if he didn't want to go there or he could answer seriously too.  It's hard to describe because they have such a close and playful communication style that it wasn't at all awkward.). I always just let it be and didn't make a big deal out of it when it was in the open (not really on purpose, it didn't really change anything in my eyes and he's always known my views on the topic and how I feel about differences in people in general).  I think he felt better coming out in his own way and own time because he was confused for awhile and didn't really know how to process all of it (what teenager really does) so I just let him talk about it if and when he felt like it. \n\nI'm gonna go with NTA here because I know that you were just curious and didn't mean any harm but I can see your son's point of view too, it's hard for some people to feel cornered into answering something they don't necessarily want to talk about right then.  I'd just apologize for making him feel like he was on the spot and leave it at that.", "YTA. Think long and hard about why your son wouldn\u2019t want to come out to you.", "YTA. But I don't know what I woulda done. The problem kinda is that people think they have the right to know about the romantic and sexual relationship of other people. And I don't think that they do", "YTA for your approach. So very, very YTA! That's not a discussion ***you*** start in the first place, and definitely not over dinner.\n\nAs a woman who has dated men and women and non-binary people there's a hot mess every which way you turn. Men aren't easier, there is no \"easier.\" So that's a strike.\n\n\"I don't want to make you uncomfortable\" and then making him uncomfortable is another strike.\n\nAsk your ex to pass on that you're sorry for how you handled things, and that you understand your son needs space and time to be furious and hurt and anything else he's feeling. If you have the insurance coverage or ability to cover or split payment for counseling offer it with no strings attached (he doesn't have to see you unless he wants to) because this is a really big deal.\n\nPFLAG is a [great place to find resources](https://pflag.org/find-resources/) to educate yourself on how not to be TA. Ask your ex if she has recommendations. She's clearly the one he trusts more with this, and I'll bet that she wants your child to be happy. \n\nI'm glad that your messed up reaction is \"go get him!\" and hope that someday the family joke is \"yeah, Dad freaked out and made assumptions but encouraged me to find a hottie.\"  And the wonderful partner your son has feels loved and fully accepted and also like your son considers him a catch.", "YTA - your son should have the opportunity to come out to you on his own and ALSO you shouldn't be springing a big question like this at the dinner table.\n\nRegardless of what you know about social etiquette around coming out specifically: you asked your son a question that you know isn't a casual question.

And let it be. \n\nTeenagers are horrible at keeping secrets... And yeah he's obviously into his boyfriend and yes he clearly wasn't ready to come out to you... For goodness knows what reason.

Don't try to force people to come out who are not ready.

It is an important step in a child's life when their curiosity about sex begins.  A lot of parents, don't give the old birds and bees story.  Parents find the \"talk\" difficult and embarrassing.  So, the kids learn about sex from their friends and some in health class.  That's just the straight kids.  Now, imagine having a talk with a gay teenager.  I am sure there a very high percentage of parents that don't know anything at all about what being gay is.  Or, have a clue of what they need to do as a supportive parents.\n\nSure, it felt alkward at the dinner table that night.  But, you were supportive as you could be in that moment.

I'll be honest - sometimes I wonder about my daughter, whether she is bi or a lesbian. But I keep quiet, because if she wanted me to know, she'd tell me.

Younger folx tend to think it's someone's right to never be questioned about who it is they are attracted to. And i get that perspective. It's just a bit of a catch-22 for parents... Does a parent acknowledge what they are seeing and support their kid in what they see or does a parent pretend to be blind and notice nothing hoping that some day their kid believes they are supportive enough to let them know.", "Because it's the kids right to come out when he chooses to with whomever he chooses.

It\u2019s not wrong to tell your son he\u2019s handsome or beautiful, but I hope it\u2019s not the only way you compliment him. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy to comment on how attractive his partners are unless he starts that conversation.\n\nAlso, you don\u2019t know he\u2019s dating the boy. He might be gay, but you can still have close platonic friendships with the gender you are attracted to.", ">How do you mean? Because I called his boyfriend handsome?\n\nI'm more focused on the part where you got your first girlfriend at 19 and your first *pretty* one at 21.

That really comes off weird.", "That's incredibly sweet and I wish more dads tried to work on their relationship with their kids beyond 'providing'. I'm 30 and just starting to emotionally connect with my dad and it's been tough. Good on you! \n\nUnfortunately, I gotta agree that this wasn't a good way to go about it. I think it would be better to do it passively, y'know, by normalizing homosexuality in the home. Imo it's enough to just not be negative towards LGBT themes when you see them. \n\n\nAnd maybe apologize to your son. Y'know, it can go a really long way to open up to a kid. Tell him that you struggled with your dad and that you wanted him to know that you love and support him no matter what, even if you made a mistake in the execution this time. I think he'll understand and you will be closer for it \u2665\ufe0f\n\nEdit: typos", "Your son may be struggling to figure out his identity or come to terms with it.

Just make pretty damn sure they KNOW from the start that some boys like boys, some girls like girls, and some of either like either or none, and that we as parents do not give a crap as long as everyone is nice to each other.", "Failing to see the compliment", "Yikes, I wonder why he didn't feel safe coming out to you /s"]}
