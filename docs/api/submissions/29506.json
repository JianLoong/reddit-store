What did you two tell each other before and after they left? \n\nI get the feeling something is missing", "ESH.\n\nI'm a service dog handler and I think everyone handled the situation poorly. You are not in the wrong for not wanting a dog in your private dwelling. It's your right not to allow even a service dog in your private home.\n\nHowever, I think the way you handled the situation was poor. It sounds like you were not very understanding of the shitty position that you put your friend and his girlfriend in and the way your actions probably made them feel. Like I said, you have every right to make the decision to not allow whatever medical equipment you want in your house, but if you choose to make that decision, you need to understand that there are effects on the person whose medical equipment you're banning. When you choose to exclude someone like that, especially on the basis of a disability that they can't control, it's understandably going to be hurtful to the person you're excluding as well as their loved ones, and you should have approached the situation with a lot of tact, empathy, and sincerity. Based on your post, it doesn't sound like you approached the situation with any of those things and that you expected them to be cool with the way you treated them, which is unreasonable.\n\nI also think your friend and his girlfriend handled the situation poorly. I can tell you that I would never, ever show up at someone's private home with my service dog without clearing it with the person first. Like I said, the homeowner has every right to not allow my dog there, and sometimes there's even very good reason for that, like someone in the home having a dog allergy or a fear of dogs. And even if the person just goes \"I don't like dogs and therefore don't want you here,\" that's their right, so I always check first and respect the homeowner's decision. The friend and the girlfriend absolutely should have spoken with you about this first.\n\nHowever, they were not assholes for being upset. You told them, \"My dislike of dogs is more important to me than spending time with you and more important to me than your physical safety,\" and while you have every right to feel that way, they also have every right to be upset by that. You can't expect that people will not have a negative reaction when you choose to treat them that way, and they are not assholes for responding negatively. They thought you were their friend and found out that you're not (or at least not a very good one) and they were disinvited from a party in front of an audience because the girlfriend has a disability, which is a super shitty thing to go through. So yeah, they're going to be upset with you about it, and I don't think they're in the wrong for feeling that way.\n\nYou both made mistakes. They should have asked you ahead of time about the dog, and you should have treated them with more empathy when telling them they had to leave and also be more understanding of the fact that you making a decision that is hurtful to others is going to have consequences.", "ESH\n\nYour friend should have said something knowing your feelings towards animals. Totally agree with that.\n\nBut your whole posts screams \"I am a disrespectful ahole\" calling his girlfriend his current fling? Don't get me started in how you talk about cats and dogs. Personally, I think I would have enjoyed the presence of the golden retriever more than yours.", "Ehhhh.... nobody comes out of this looking good.\n\nYour buddy should have given you a heads-up beforehand.\n\nYour anti-animal stance is so extreme that you chased away a friend.

You're home is not a business you are not required to let a service animal in. If you don't want animals in your home they should respect that. They should also check before coming over. That could have handled a lot of the issue.", "As a service dog handler myself, I\u2019m going to say you are not legally obligated to have anyone\u2019s dog in your own home - nor for that matter are you required to allow people to use a wheelchair or any other means of mitigating their medical conditions in your home.  Would you be an AH for having antique floors, making everyone remove their shoes and refusing to allow someone in a wheelchair to enter?  Or if you liked dogs but had a cat that attacked them, refusing entry on that basis?  I\u2019m conflicted because I would be excluded here, but I don\u2019t think so, your house is not open the public, it\u2019s your own house, you don\u2019t have to have dogs in your own home if you despise them.  Of course you\u2019ll probably lose your friend if you hate dogs enough not to want to be anywhere near them, and many people would say if you hate dogs that says something about you which is not great - we certainly wouldn\u2019t be friends - but you\u2019re not excluding me from accessing anywhere publicly, so I\u2019m calling NAH.", "NTA. \n\nI absolutely love all dogs, but\u2026:\n\nYou don\u2019t bring __any__ animal to someone\u2019s house without giving them the heads up first, not guide dogs, service animals, emotional support animals, or your \u201chonestly he loves everyone\u201d tarantula that has separation anxiety. \n\nI\u2019m being flippant but my point is that you don\u2019t bring __any__ animal to someone else\u2019s home without their ok. \n\nWhat if you or one of your other guests was extremely allergic, and could get anaphylaxis? \n\nWhat if your tenancy explicitly barred dogs from even visiting?\n\nWhat if you had bowls of chocolate out for people to munch on and the dog ate them and got sick or died?\n\nWhat if you just don\u2019t want a random dog in your home?", "NTA. \n\nThe friend should have reached out to you first to make sure it was okay. I say this as someone who loves animals, especially dogs and cats. It is never okay to assume that someone will be okay with something like this.", "NAH. You\u2019re allowed to not want animals in your house. Thats your safe space, that you get complete reign over. What you say, goes. She can\u2019t help that she needs a service animal. It sucks, but it is what it is. Your friend shouldn\u2019t have kept pushing.\n\nBut something is suspicious to me. She needs it for Diabetes, but is okay with the dog being locked in the garage, away from her? Im no expert, but I don\u2019t think it works like that.", "NTA, it's your personal house, not a public space, you're allowed to have rules about who or what comes in it. And it's not like she brought an insulin pump and you turned her away, it's a whole animal. And your friend knew that and didn't even give you a head's up nor did they take your compromise which you didn't have to give in the first place.\n\nEDIT; also it's not even your long time friend's dog, it's his short term girlfriend's. She's a guest at someone's house who she doesn't even know, she absolutely should've checked if it would've been ok to bring the dog, and your friend shouldn't have let her think it was totally okay. \"Well then she couldn't have participated in the party\" oh well, not everyone gets to go to every party or event.", "If you said \u201cThat dog has to go, and tell her to take her golden retriever with her\u201d then you would be the asshole.

I'm all for service animals being allowed places, but when you are going to a private event, especially at a private home, it's not ok to just assume an animal is welcome. What if you had a guest that was severely allergic? Let alone the fact that you are 100% allowed to just never want pets in your home. Them not asking ahead of time was an AH move.  You didn't make a scene, you offered a compromise and pulled him aside.", "NTA. Even if your stance against animals is a bit extreme, it\u2019s your home. & your friend knew you didn\u2019t like animals. Why he would even want to bring one around someone who is so aggressively against animals is beyond me. \n\nEven more so - he had no idea if anyone there was severely allergic to animals either.", "NTA. You weren't informed of the dog and there are other means to track your Diabetes that do not include a dog. People here in this comment section are behaving like this person wouldn't have been able to function without the dog, which is not the case if this had been addressed before and she could've taken a blood test with her instead to measure her insulin. In my country there are no service dogs for Diabetes afaik and everyone I know who has diabetes has a little sensor on their skin that measures their blood sugar levels. While I personally think it's great to have that replaced by a dog, I think people also need to be accepting of the fact that the service animal is not a crutch or wheelchair but instead a living, shedding, drooling being, and not everyone likes to have those in their home.", "your house your rules. but ppl need to understand that these people NEED their dogs to survive. ESH only because they did not inform you beforehand", "ESH\n\nYour friend for bringing someone who brings an animal she needs with her without clearing this with you first. Esp when you have stated you don't want animals in the house.\n\nYou are also TA for denying a service dog and thereby the GF access to the house. If they had checked up before hand she could have taken a blood monitor with her and then there shouldn't have neem an issue at all.", "NTA. If someone showed up to my home with a service dog that was not discussed beforehand I would let them know my home is animal-free and, while I understand that she may need the dog for her health it wasn't allowed in my home. I've had golden retrievers in the past. I loved them, but they shed. I no longer love dogs like I once did, and someone else's dogs hair on my things is a no for me. Your tone may have been harsh, but showing up with an animal to your home without talking to you, and expecting you to accommodate them is an asshole move.", "Well, this is \u201cam I the AH\u201d not \u201cam I within my legal rights\u201d and I\u2019m going to go with YTA because of your response and your reasoning. Your friend should have given you a heads up, given your extreme attitude about animals, and should know you well enough to know you were going to be an AH about it. But your reasoning is poor - you were hosting a pumpkin carving party, an activity so notoriously messy I don\u2019t even carve pumpkins at my house even though I love all things Halloween, but *animals* are filthy. Pets are no more inherently filthy than people, and I\u2019ll bet the expensive service animal she requires to go everywhere with her is very well groomed. Also, all you needed to do is explain you weren\u2019t given a heads up about the animal coming and that you aren\u2019t comfortable with animals. Telling them \u201cit\u2019s still a fucking animals\u201d is petty and an AH move.\n\nSo are you entitled to your boundaries? Sure. Were you an AH? Also yes.", "NAH I have a SD and I never go to anyone\u2019s private home without checking. I have had one for 4 years now, my aunt doesn\u2019t like dogs. She doesn\u2019t host at her home if I\u2019m coming home for the holidays. It\u2019s always my dad or my other Aunt. She doesn\u2019t want a dog in her home and I\u2019m not mad at it. She understands he needed and my dad can\u2019t sit by me 24/7 at a family event. So my dad hosts when I come to town. \n\nIt\u2019s your private home, you don\u2019t have to allow it.\n\nThey should have told you, so they wouldn\u2019t have to feel rejected.", "NTA. They just showed up and expected to treat your home like it was a public space.\n\nNervy. And very assholian of them. \n\nYour \"friend\" should have asked instead of just springing it on you...it's like he was trying to shame you into allowing the dog and was really shocked when his attempt backfired.", "NTA. The dog should have been discussed beforehand. Your house is not a public place and you aren\u2019t legally required to allow her to bring her dog. Obviously, if they\u2019d informed you prior to the party that GF would need to bring her service dog in order to attend, and you\u2019d said no, they wouldn\u2019t be A H for declining the invitation.\n\nMy issue with their assuming the dog would be welcome in your home is that they seem to have a complete disregard for you or any other potential host. What happens if they show up to someone\u2019s home who is extremely allergic or debilitatingly afraid of dogs? What if they bring the dog into someone\u2019s home and the hosts own animals become stressed or even flee out of fear of the GF\u2019s dog? \n\nI get that she needs the dog around, but hosts need to be given that information up front. It simply may not be feasible for every household to welcome a dog\u2014even a service animal\u2014hosts should be given the option, or at the very least, be given the opportunity to plan for this added \u201cguest.\u201d", "YTA for not making an exception for a disability aid.\nI\u2019m sure Reddit will tell you n t a or e s h.\nBut if you think a service dog is more filthy than carving pumpkins you\u2019re out to lunch.", "NTAthis is a private residence she should have checked in first.

It\u2019s your house, so if you don\u2019t want dogs in it, that is your decision. If your friend knows your stance on animals on the house, he should have definitely checked with you first before just showing up with his girlfriend and her dog in tow. My guess is she would have been fine for a few hours without the dog. If her diabetes is to the point she has a service animal, she almost certainly has a continuous glucose monitor, which gives her real time data on her glucose levels, and she had her boyfriend their to assist her should she start trending low.
