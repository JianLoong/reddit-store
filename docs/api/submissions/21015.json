I decided to talk to one of my friends in private about it before we finished, asking if they could just let me pay for myself. And they acted understanding about this until after the meal.

Pay for yourself before you ever return to the table. Then when the big check comes, you just say, \"oh, I already paid for my meal\" and they can look at the bill and see your items aren't included.

Better yet, they would choose shared activities that don't necessarily involve high spending that would put you on the spot to pay most of your income towards eating out.

This really should have been brought up earlier.  However, they ordered way more than you can reasonably afford.  \n\nSpliting the bill this way is incredibly common for people who are financially secure.  Where paying a bit extra for a meal isn't going to hurt and it's worth saving the effort to do the math.  It's just easier to have everyone put their cards on the table and split it down the middle.  Lots of places don't do separate checks or allow for different ways to split it.  \n\nHowever this only really works when everyone is comfortable with it.

When you arrive at the table to order tell the waitress yours is on a spectate ticket/check that way it is established from the start.", "You are the cheap one??? You want to pay for what you had and your friends expect yoi to subsidise them.and you are the cheap one??? You need new friends, these ones ate total assholes.  NTA", "NTA. I've never understood why some people think this is fair. If I was you I'd just stop going to restaurants with them.", "Don't split the fucking bill.  Seriously, I never understood that shit.  Get separate checks and only pay for what you ordered.  And get better friends.  NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou lost 6 people who showed you they didn't truly care about you or pay attention. That hurts a lot, they don't deserve you and you don't deserve their mistreatment. \n\nIt's easy enough for you to pay for what you ordered and they split their bill.\n\nMy bestie and I eat out a lot and also have vastly different amounts of income. \n\nWe always ask to have our shared food split and our drinks on separate bills. If he orders more food for himself, it goes on his bill.\n\nWhy should anyone pay for something they didn't order or take part in eating.\nI would never ask that of a friend or want that of them, it's unfair.\n\nGood friends are aware of your ability to afford things, they don't ask that you pay for their share, so that only they benefit and you suffer.\n\nI understand it's hard right now but I'd bet you look back and are thankful this occurred.\n\nYou may not have left this group otherwise.\nNow you can remind yourself of your value and go find friends with matching value systems.\n\nYou're better off and are going to feel better off soon!!\n\nTry out some friend apps, some local meet up groups for hobbies you enjoy.\nHiking groups are great, let you chat, focus on the hike for less pressure and they are free.\n\nTry to find one new friend that's quality.\nMaybe there's an old friend or someone at school or work or a cousin that you can start grabbing coffee with.\n\nWhen money is tight, there's always coffees, walks, picnics where you pack food. Or breweries that let you bring your own food in so that you only pay for drinks.\n\nI only have a few friends myself, but they are absolutely priceless quality companions. \n\nYou'll get through this.\n\nAnd they were definitely AH's.\nYou were not one in the slightest.\n\nReal friends want your company, want you to come out regardless, even if it means you sip one drink all night and drink waters.\nOr they offer to split an affordable appie with you so that your cost is lower.\n\nNTA\n\nIt gets better!", "NTA.\nLuckily you didn't lose 6 friends you lost 6 show ponies......\nThe ex-friend saying \"everyone pays their fair share\" is incorrect, you paying for more than your actual share is subsidizing their meals and drinks.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry OP that you had to find out in such a hard way that these people you hang\nout with are not in fact your friends. These folks if they were your friends would not have a problem with an innocuous request. And also\ngiven that they all have so much money they ideally would consider paying for you a friend that is obviously struggling financially and under-resourced. There is nothing wrong with you. You will find new friends, people who actually like and support you. Unfortunately these ex friends are not very nice.", "NTA. Don\u2019t even think about the jerks.", "NTA. You quite literally \"paid your fair share\". They want you to pay an unfair share. \n\nNot exactly a sustainable solution, but maybe one night you can agree to split evenly, knowing it'll be pricey, then out order EVERYONE at the table. Get the MOST expensive stuff. Then when you \"pay your fair share\" like they want, you'll end up paying LESS than you ordered. I'm sure doing this once will send the proper message.", "NTA \n\nThe only correct response to this is to respond to the group \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I upset anyone the other night but honestly all I\u2019m trying to do is pay my fair share. I purposely choose to order a simple meal and drink that I know I can afford, and don\u2019t partake in any shared dishes with the rest of you. My food + drink the other night came to $20 - rounding up for taxes and tip that would bring me to $25. Yet my share of the total bill was calculated  to be $80+tip.\n\nI don\u2019t begrudge anyone who has the financial means to splurge when dining out, but I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to expect anyone else to subsidise your expensive dining habits\u201d", "NTA... They simply are not friends. There is no way I'd do this to anyone I dined with. Talking to them ahead of time was the right thing to do. You are worth so much more then their pretending success.  Success comes from being genuine and considerate.  Look for 1 friend like this. They will be worth more then dozens of fake ones.", "I don't think you are the AH but you need to be more decisive and communicative.\n\nYOU KNEW that they do a split and go to TOO expensive places AND you can't afford to pay the \"split\".\n\nSo you SHOULD have made your regrets for the expensive restaurant OR you should have explained the problem ahead of time and that you could ONLY afford to pay your bill NOT do a split.  THOSE are ADULT options.\n\nNOT going to expensive restaurant and then after meal but before bill you tell ONE person in private that yo can only pay for yourself.  Yes, they are Unempathetic AH's but you needed to speak up or make a better choice.", "Nta. You did pay your fair share. You paid for what you had. That's your fair share. You don't exist to supplement their meals.", "Splitting by number of people only works if you all ordered similarly priced items or if you all ordered with the intention of sharing a bit of everything with the table. One of my friend groups often does this and it generally all comes out in the wash. We\u2019re also all of similar income levels and no one is disproportionately disadvantaged. \n\nOPs friends are total AH\u2019s though. That bill absolutely should have been split by person.", "Someone who can relate, if they come round like \u201cand will anyone be having desserts?\u201d LIKE PLEASE DONT", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Why? Because they understand my situation, and that I would have to stop going out with them if I had to match them. They value my presence, and so they do what it takes to keep me with them. That\u2019s what friends do.", "You\u2019re kind of being an AH to yourself, though. How did it happen more than once that you went out to eat with these ppl and it took half your monthly income? \n\nThere\u2019s no education in the second kick of a mule. \n\nThese ppl aren\u2019t your friends so find some working class friends, ppl who understand your situation because it\u2019s their situation, too."]}
