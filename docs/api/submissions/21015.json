I usually enjoy all of this except when we go out for a meal, because I\u2019ll be honest, my friends are pretty wealthy compared to me. They are really nice people and are there for me if I need them, as I am with them. But every time we go out for a meal I know that I\u2019m going to suffer at the end. Here\u2019s the story:\n\nWe sat down and we all ordered what we want, I ordered myself a burger with an orange juice. They all kept asking me if I wanted a starter or something and I said no. (I literally just can\u2019t afford it), they ordered expensive bottles of wine, a large number of sides and extremely expensive steaks, etc. and I knew what was coming towards the end of the meal, and I couldn\u2019t really pay a split bill again as I end up paying almost quadruple the price of anything I\u2019ve ordered. I decided to talk to one of my friends in private about it before we finished, asking if they could just let me pay for myself. And they acted understanding about this until after the meal. All of my friends started acting weird around me and I was worried i had done something wrong. For a while nobody spoke to me until I asked if everything was okay and one of them decide to dm me. \n\nIt reads \u201clook a lot of us are kind of upset because you\u2019re taking the piss a little mate, everyone pays their fair share you know this. It was just a dick move\u201d \n\nreading this message made me extremely upset, all of those friends are in stocks and make so much more money than me, they own businesses and do stuff I can\u2019t understand. I\u2019m a support worker on minimum wage and it\u2019s like they live a different life to me. \n\nI tried explaining I can\u2019t even afford rent and that it\u2019s just different for me and all he could say was \u201cjust do what we are doing it\u2019s not hard, or just don\u2019t come out with us at all\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve literally lost 6 friends within a month and I can\u2019t have any motivation to leave the house, this situation has flared up worse with my BPD, and caused me to question everything.  They\u2019ve even called me cheap behind my back in the group chat, and I feel like I\u2019ve been extremely rude . \n\n\nShould I have just paid the split bill?

Separate tickets next time, if you decide you still want to be friends with such people.", "I do NOT understand this new trend to split a bill amongst the number of diners rather than paying for your own dinner.   Am I really that ancient?  Back in my day (Old people phrasing intentional) you simply told the server 'separate checks please' when you ordered and then you each paid a separate check, and you each left a generous tip that usually added up to much more than would have been paid on a single check, to make up for the slight hassle of multiple checks at one table.     \n\n\nSo, from my POV, NTA.  But I'm not sure you can continue socializing with this group of friends if they get this upset over the dinner bill.", "NTA. Next time order first telling the waitstaff that you'd like your order on a separate bill. That way your dinner moochers will know before they order a single thing that they will be splitting the bill without you.", "NTA and they are being ridiculous. I've been in this situation.\n\nWhat you do is you get up and speak to the wait person. Ask for an individual check to pay your portion (if they don't want to because it's a big group or whatever, say you need to leave and settle things now). Pay for yourself before you ever return to the table. Then when the big check comes, you just say, \"oh, I already paid for my meal\" and they can look at the bill and see your items aren't included. Has a side benefit of making it really obvious that they were trying to stick you with their bills.\n\nEDIT: the way they've behaved shows they aren't actual friends. They can do math and understand how they're ripping you off, they just choose not to care.", "NTA it sounds like your 'friends' value your money more than your presence. Your better of without them.

I recently went out to my city's fancy celebration spot with my friends and the server asked us when we were ordering if it was one check or separate.", "NTA but your friends are.\n\nThis is something that happens among friend groups. And at some point, someone has to stand up and say \"let's all pay for what we ordered + tax + tip\". And it's not always an easy conversation to have.\n\n>everyone pays their fair share you know this.\n\nTha's fine - but **they're not paying their fair share.** You're the one paying extra.\n\nHow to move forward - \n\nEither stop going out with them or tell them you'll meet them after/before the meal. You can do the movie and then go home. \n\nLook - I sometimes go out with friends. (same group of friends). Some people get a started and booze and an entree. Some people get an entree and water. Some people get dessert and coffee. It's all good. We each keep track of what we ordered and pay our fair share.", "NTA- why do people do that when they dine out with friends? Unless it\u2019s a family style meal.. it shouldn\u2019t be that way. That concept is so odd to me. Everyone pays for themselves.. and split what is shared. Idk.

Better yet, they would choose shared activities that don't necessarily involve high spending that would put you on the spot to pay most of your income towards eating out. Whatever happened to drinks/cooking at home with friends? Grabbing a cooler of beers and meeting at a park to kick around a ball or play frisbee or whatever? \n\nAssess why you're still hanging out with these pricks and if it's worth it.

This really should have been brought up earlier.  However, they ordered way more than you can reasonably afford.  \n\nSpliting the bill this way is incredibly common for people who are financially secure.  Where paying a bit extra for a meal isn't going to hurt and it's worth saving the effort to do the math.  It's just easier to have everyone put their cards on the table and split it down the middle.  Lots of places don't do separate checks or allow for different ways to split it.  \n\nHowever this only really works when everyone is comfortable with it.  When you have people in the group with significant differences in income, then the respectful thing to do is order equivalent meals or separate based on what you order.  \n\nThey are raging assholes.  They do no respect you.  Not because how they wanted to split the bill, but because of how they treated you.  I recommend finding better friends.", "NTA times 10.  These people are not true friends.

Invite them to places within your price range or for things such as coffee, ice cream, or a bakery. Or even completely free stuff. I have had the \"poor friend\" who insists on coming to the expensive stuff, and it isn't fun for anyone.

This is likely why they're being dicks and not taking your life circumstances into consideration with their planning: you're now a tertiary friend at the edge of their circle, rather than a bestie.

I have one group of friends that often goes to breakfast together, and one of them, like OP, has less money, so we each pay our own.  When I go out with my one friend, we alternate paying and don't keep track.  With others we just do a split, but usually anyone who has gotten anything really expensive *voluntarily* chips in more.   \n\nIf you are ordering a much cheaper meal, I think it's fair for you to buy your own, and the rest of them can do whatever they like.", "It's often done with friends in the reverse situation to the op.\n\nTo make meals less awkward the rich guy says listen, we split the bill, eat what you want. Essentially the rich guy wants to stay friends, not have dinners where the people with less money feel uncomfortable or eat a salad, everyone can eat the same way and the richest one subsidises the meal.\n\nOPs is the opposite, OP felt bad about lack of money so ordered much more cheaply and rich guys want OP to subsidise their meal.\n\nBill splitting has happened forever, as has split checks, or one person picking up the tab, or taking turns picking up the tabs. Every group is different, every group has different financial dynamics between people in it, there is no one answer fits all situation thing here.\n\nAlso to point out, there is no requirement nor is it normal for the richest guy to always pay out to subsidise everyone else. If they offer it's cool but if you also immediately order the most expensive things on the menu because your friend is paying that's a dick move.", "This has been around for awhile.
