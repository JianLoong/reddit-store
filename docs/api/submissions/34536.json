Many of you have great points of knowing music and what songs are appropriate for vocal ranges. I did theater from 14 til 22 and had taken vocal lessons. I even had a band in HS that was just for fun.\n\nSecondly, many of you may be wondering if I cut Travis off in the wake of this. And the short answer, no. Yes he was a major Richard to me, and said many harsh words, but we went through the runt of it in life when it really counted. I know many people cut off friends when it\u2019s clear they don\u2019t want you, but I\u2019m more of a, \u201cjust let me know when you are free to talk\u201d person, not to everyone, but the people I love.\n\nI went to Travis\u2019 place, with Taylor as mediator, to finally attempt to squash this feud. It was lengthy, but what sold the deal was this statement. \u201cT, Ive known you since kindergarten. We\u2019ve been through stuff no other duo has. And you know that I love Taylor as my own sister. Do you really expect yourself to believe that I would ruin your guys\u2019 special day over this?\u201d That really made him wake up. He apologized. Apparently, and I genuinely didn\u2019t know this, this was his Taylor\u2019s and her sisters\u2019 favorite song. When she died from a stroke, Taylor was devastated. Travis made the song a new memory with the proposal, and the expected walk down song and was planning a surprise honor for Taylor\u2019s sister at the ceremony. When that didn\u2019t happen, Travis went into a deep anger when his plan didn\u2019t go through. I\u2019ll admit I had told him that I was filling in for the singer, I didn\u2019t tell him that I was changing the song until the quick rehearsal before letting people in. He realized that I truly didn\u2019t know this and apologized. We are good now\n\nThird and final update, I\u2019ve been asked to consider singing for weddings. And I\u2019m going to be. However, like I said, I\u2019m not a professional singer. So I\u2019m only doing it for close family/friends weddings. I got asked to do one for my other friends for this summer!!\n\nThank you all!", "created_utc": 1704643777, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/190vh1m/update_aita_for_changing_the_walk_down_song_at_a/", "score": 32, "replies": ["#[Please Find Original Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18uuruv/aita_for_changing_the_walk_down_song_at_a_wedding/)", "Awesome!
