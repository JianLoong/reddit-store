The kid will never want to reveal his full name. Can you imagine? \u201cMy name is Jack Charles Manson\u201d. People are going to immediately pick up on it and fixate on it, sadly. I liked someone else suggestion of using the brothers middle name as a first name or a middle name", "Instead of Charles being in the name directly, my suggestion would be to use a middle name if the brother had one. I would stay away from Charles at all costs. \n\nAnother idea for OP is to compromise with Carl/Karl which is a form of Charles. I would still use it as a middle name because honour names as first names always feels unfair to the child.", "I appreciate your help.\n\nHowever, my wife does not speak with her family outside of her brother. And our SIL is already dealing with so much already, it wouldn't be right to force her to mediate our bickering.", "Her brother's middle name is not a name we can give our son, but I appreciate your help.", "Actually, two or three years ago my wife once jokingly said to me \"it's a shame we can never have a kid named Marilyn.\"\n\nI guess she believes it's different with Charles Manson though. I know that grieving has been extremely difficult.", "My wife didn't really know much about Charles Manson. She believes it's a common enough name that nobody would bat an eye. She compared it to thousands of people being named John Smith, and nobody compares one of them to another. I don't know though.", "Maybe if they have 2 middle names, so it would be \u201c(First name) Charles (middle name 2) Manson\u201d. Or maybe that would also be bad? Idk\u2026", "I feel like it's still weird as a middle name even. I don't think there's a great compromise for this", "I do not see that being much of an improvement, but thanks anyway.", ">I also understand your wife\u2019s feelings in this, though.\n\nWhile I understand her feelings as well, I still think she's an asshole for saying that OP is an asshole and is disrespecting her brother just because he doesn't want to name their kid Charles Manson.", "Appreciate your help but that is not feasible. Both my wife and I have built careers, and use our current last name. Changing that could mess up the good reputation we have at our jobs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor clarity, we do not have good reputations *because* of our last names. Rather, because we worked very hard and people recognize us by our names that we have used for years.", "No doubt that the grief is making this more difficult for everyone, especially her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will definitely check out the subredit, thank you very much!", "Fight this name at all cost. Be gentle but, don\u2019t back off.", "Maybe you can look together for some different names, but ones that start with E and C.", "I would be fine with that suggestion, however, my late brother in law's middle name is the same name as my wife's abusive father.", "You're right. A lot of people withhold telling someone their middle name because they just don't like it. And the double edge sword is him saying it's a family name which ruins the sentiment and will make him feel bad when he is older. You are in a tough spot. Even Charlie people will pick up.", "Tell her to do some internet search. I am from Europe and know who and what is C.Manson. This is not just US based. \nI am with you. Not ok for the child. \nTbh... I have at some times asked parents to be to reconsider the name. Bullying or your example. \nI once met a girl whose name is roughly translared \"Vivid Horror\". \nAnd there is also a guy named Donald Duck. As his father supposedly lost a bet. \n\nI can not understand for the life of me how did your wife not have heard of the Charles Manson. Tell her to google. And hopefully she will see what will happen when someone will do an internet search for the little one. \n\nI am wishing you good luck. And have other names prepared. NTA", "Sayin that, will be a great ice breaker with chicks when he\u2019s older"]}
