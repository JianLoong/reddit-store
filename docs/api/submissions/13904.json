She will sully the name of her beloved brother by people assuming that your son is named after a murderer instead of a loved one.\n\nUnlike most people, I disagree with the idea that your son will be bullied for his name\u2014I think the two of you, though, will be massively judged and your son will have immense headaches with legal documents as he gets older and people assume that it is a fake name.", "It might be worthwhile showing her just how much media, including recent, has been released about Charles Manson. She may not know much, but that's definitely not the case in the world at large. He's dead and he's still all over the place. I think her grief is clouding her judgement a bit.
