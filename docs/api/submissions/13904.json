I understand her wanting to pay memory to her brother but this is a hill i would personally die on.", "Charles Manson is infamous, and he will get bullied and weitd stares with that name, trust me. People will think you guys deliberately named him after the actual Charles Manson. Good luck!! I hope she sees reason. She is grieving and I understand where she's coming from.", "Does your wife live under a rock??? Even South Park did an episode about the guy! Please do NOT name your kid after that monster. Show your wife this thread", "Everyone will notice. It\u2019s barely one step below naming your kid Adolf Hitler.", "It\u2019s because John Smith is literally a name to not distinguish one from the other.  \n\nJust because she doesn\u2019t know about Charles Manson doesn\u2019t mean millions of other people don\u2019t", "True crime podcasts and shows are extremely popular right now. The kids ABSOLUTELY know who Charlie Manson is. \nNta", "He only died in 2017!", "I just asked my teenager if they knew who Charles Manson was, and they answered in the affirmative. And their friends from 14-17yo do as well.", "Even if they don't know, everyone has googled their own name or the names of their friends at some point, usually as a bored kid. One way or another, they'll know.", "My niece is 11, and to my shock, she knew who Charles Manson was. It's not a good name for a kid. No one in their right mind would let their kid go through life with that name.", "Kids know. My 15 year old knows. And honestly, kids use the internet so young now, all they have to do is overhear ONE adult (and someone WILL say something) giggling about it and they will google the shit out of it and everyone in the school will know.", "It only takes one kid... or parent to mention it and it will be bully central/brought up all the time.", "I'm Canadian and I know who he is. Every time one of his group comes up for parole, or dies ; the whole story comes out again. Every time Roman Polanski is mentioned, the whole story comes out. Besides, your son's teachers will be old enough to remember.", "True, the kids won't, but their parents will absolutely know who Charles Manson.", "What your wife has to remember though, is at 1 point, your kid is going to Google themselves. What will be the 1st search option when he does that? Also, just because kids won't know it, doesn't mean ADULTS won't. Your kid is going to have to start explaining their name RIGHT away. To teachers or their friends parents. Also, kids in class are going to go home and say, hey, my new friend is Charles Manson. What are the chances the parents say nothing? What are the chances the parents of those kids will make their kid stop being friends with your son BECAUSE of his name. You will become very isolated because what other weird things are you going to be involved with if you're willing to name your kid after a serial killer? Do you worship him? These are things other adults WILL be thinking about and judging you for. Also, how on EARTH is your son expected to make a career as an adult when NO ONE can Google his name, for say a business he starts? \n\nThis is 100% a hill to die on and remind your wife that it's a 2 yes's 1 no situation. \n\nAlso, what were you thinking of naming him before brother died?\n\nDoes your sister think that her brothers kids don't have the right to the name when they want to have kids? If she uses it now, they probably won't, because it's already taken by their cousin.", "Completely inaccurate. Shes really just not thinking clearly. Understandable, but she needs to set the name aside until shes seen a grief specialist. Just dont pick a name. Wait til he is here and shes had some therapy.", "Maybe most kids wouldn't know. But all it takes is for one to know about it. It's a terrible idea.", "I think using a name that means brother is lovely.", "Right? Something else with significance. I suggested that if they grew up in Austin to use that, or if they both loved the Beatles, to use Jude. Heck, let's say they both loved The Sopranos, name the kid Anthony. There's just SO many other options.", "For some reason this thread is making me laugh. I was thinking, \u2018How old is this cousin? Was he born before WW2?!\u2019 Because whether you are a German colony living in Paraguay or Mars, how could you NOT be aware of a lunatic launching a World War in your homeland??", "She was released but she\u2019s on permanent house arrest.  She can\u2019t live alone and has to live in a light security state operated home so she can be watched.  She\u2019s out but not free.  If she slips up then back into prison she goes.  There are videos on YouTube that talk about famous serial killers and Charles Manson, Ted Bundy, John Gacy, are popular stories.  Manson was known for his cult, Bundy for being a Romeo, and Gacy the terrifying clown.  These people are used as examples of what you need to do to avoid cults, strangers and weird guys in general.\n\nDon\u2019t let her make your sons life miserable.  You see all the stories about bullying and how tit ends for some kids.  Don\u2019t put your kid on the path of torture and depression right out the gate.  You mentioned your wife doesn\u2019t associate with her parents because of the abuse she endured.  Well this is how your son will see it. You didn\u2019t do enough to save him from his torment as a baby.  He will also grow to hate the man he was named after because of the association to the famous serial killer.  Did you also know that these serial killers are mentioned in popular tv shows like Law and Order, Criminal Minds, CSI, American Horror Stories, etc.  All shows get recycled and so do movie themes.  How would you feel if you went to see a movie and there was a bit about Manson in it and it became a popular movie.  You\u2019re kid would be ridiculed even if you don\u2019t let him see the movie it will be put there.", "Charles Manson went by \u201cCharlie\u201d. He was only really referred to as \u201cCharles\u201d by the media.\n\nu/ThrowRA_Names12, what was your brother in law\u2019s middle name? Maybe you could use that instead.", "Did your parents know that the name was if a serial killer? Why did they choose it?", "Charlemagne Mason, the classy mass murderer.", "I had a sub teacher in high school who\u2019s name was Kay (middle initial K) Kitler. Yes you read that right: Kay K Kitler. According to the school grape vine his parents were immigrants to the US had had no freaking idea what they were setting their kid up with for a name", "Charles Manson is infamous enough, even in other parts of the world. And if not directly, then via the famous shockrock singer/band Marilyn Manson, whose nickname is a contraction between Marilyn Monroe and Charles Manson.", "People still know who Charles Manson is, outside of the US too. It\u2019s also not impossible there\u2019ll be a future super popular TV show based on him like Dahmer. The Dahmer series had people shying away from aviator style glasses frames even though that\u2019s what they normally choose.\n\nPeople will always have a morbid fascination with serial killers, this one won\u2019t be forgotten for a long time.", "It's absolutely not a common enough name that no one would bat an eye, because people with the last name Manson *stopped naming their children Charles* after, well. Everything. \n\nI'm Swedish and knew who he was back in middle school. I'm not even into true crime, he's that notorious!", "Marilyn Manson actually chose the Manson part of his stage name after Charles Manson.", "They 100% knew....", "Well, here in Mexico nobody would blame the person, but the parents. Having your name changed here is lengthy and expensive, so almost nobody ever does.", "I think she would be thinking differently. As others said, use it as a middle name? Or use her brother's middle name as a first name if it's something decent?"]}
