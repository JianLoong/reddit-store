My husband (62M) and I sometimes pick up Hunter from his preschool, we are on the list of approved pickups, probably pick him up once a week on average. On Monday, we needed to pick up Hunter again, I went along as my husband was out getting McDonald's for when we broguht Hunter back to our place. \r  \n\r  \nWhen I went to arrive to pick him up, I was told I needed to sign an incident report form, I know these things happen, and like usual, before I signed, I was told what had happened. The woman doing pick up told me that Hunter was using the f slur against another student. I was horrified and asked the woman if she knew if any of the other kids had said that, as I had no idea where he could have picked up that language as he is only 3, but she said that's the first time she knew of that happening.\r  \n\r  \nOnce in the car, I was talking to Hunter about his day and then asked about the incident, and told him that was a word he could never say as that word hurts peoples feelings. He told me that Kylo uses that word against Rockwell's friend. Rockwell plays baseball and is friends with some other athleets, including a boy who does cheer and gymnastics. Rockwell's friend is gay. He told me Rockwell got angry when Kylo used that word and he didn't know why. I asked him why he said it, and he said he didn't know, and I didn't press him any further, becaus, again, he's 3, I just explained once more he could never, ever say that word again.\r  \n\r  \nWhen Kim and Gary came to pick Hunter up, I told them what had happened and they started to get defensive, Kim told me \"you don't know what it's like to raise a gifted kid\" (Kylo is in a gifted and talented program at his school, focuses on STEM, which he loves). Kim and Gary said that \"sometimes gifted kids will act up\". I asked how they would adress this and they said it was none of my buisness and that I was being a \"helicopter grandma\". I was upset and at this point, started to scream at them about how if they were going to be upset about how I act as a grandparent. that my husband and I don't need to be around Hunter.\r  \n\r  \n Later that night, I got a call from my other daugther, Beth (34F), she said she wanted to help bring peace between me and Kim and suggested I apologize, I told her I wouldn't because I didn't think I did anything wrong. My husband is also on my side. We haven't spoken to either of our daughters since Monday.

I scolded my daughter and son-in-law for getting nasty at me after they said I didn't know what it was like to raise a gifted kid after I told them that their 3 y/o had picked up homophobic language from their 11 y/o and asked what they were going to do about it. They got really defensive, so I argued back saying if they didn't want me to act as a grandparent, I didn't have to.\n\n2.

Your daughter and SIL are homophobes.  This isn\u2019t \u201cacting up,\u201d this is bigotry, and they\u2019re too lazy to do anything about it.\n\nFormer gifted kid myself.  If your daughter and SIL aren\u2019t smart enough to use the internet or, you know, books to figure out how to parent a gifted kid, they\u2019re doing that kid - and the world at large - a real disservice.

I am raising a Highly gifted 2e child. My older 2 were also gifted and your daughter and her husband are failing their son. Gifted kids are more able to understand things at earlier ages when it comes to inclusion and diversity. When they have been taught or showed how to treat and accept others. When they are allowed to watch bad tic-tok videos and make friends with kids who are not or who have not been taught these things they will often follow the crowd hoping to fit in. A lot of times they will either dumb themselves down while with these kids to compensate for being different or they will gravitate to the bad kids in groups in hopes of not being picked on or just being accepted.  He needs to be taught these things are bad, keep him away from the tic-tok trends and Andrew Tate type things found on the internet. He might be smart but he is acting dumb and going down a bad path. Not every kid is going to take being made fun of, and many of them have athletic and popular friends or family members.

If you think that's going to make her address the issue, you're wrong.", "ESH. How old are you? Controlling your emotions so you don\u2019t scream at another adult would be a good start. Threatening to cut off a three year old is an incredibly immature response.

They will have lots of problems as the kid grows up.\n\nAlso ... since they were so defensive ... I wonder if this sort of behavior has been common with the gifted kid?", "EsH is the easy designation. But it completely ignores how OP daughter deals with the incident. He's gifted and they act out.. whoa is me I have 3 kids. While maybe OPs tone could have been brought down a notch, getting loud may have been the only way to get through at that moment.\nSaying she won't pick up the child was most likely a last comment made in the heat of the moment. \nOp..

If my children\u2019s grandparents said something like this to me they would absolutely not be around my children anymore. \n\nThey\u2019re struggling with their gifted child. And that can be a real struggle. Is Kylo\u2019s language ok? Absolutely not. Is it possible that there is a list of dozens of other daily behavioral issues with him? Also absolutely. \n\nYou hit a nerve when pressing them about their parenting in an area where they\u2019re already struggling.

You don\u2019t abandon your gkids because you don\u2019t like how their parents responded to something.

This is coming from a former \"gifted\" student who thinks we need a better way to explain academically attuned minds v.s. coding v.s. things like arts and music.
