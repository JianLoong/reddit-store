And it's ok.\n\nYou did nothing wrong, and as long as your response wasn't hostile, you said nothing wrong.  It's perfectly normal to not want a child even though you happen to have a uterus.

They may not understand how fucked up they are treating you, they may not ever want to change, but you should hold true to yourself and know it is not your fault. \n\nSome people just treat others shitty because of their own issues.

You're still a child. And you also already said you don't want children. Of course you don't have maternal instincts. \n\nIt's really weird how she messaged you out of blue like this just to start an argument. From the sounds of the things i highlighted earlier, she might have been intending for you to be a surrogate, or at least living vicariously through you if you had children of your own. And since the conversation didn't go the way she planned she's now trying to guilt trip you for not engaging in the conversation the way she wanted. But this might not be the case, this is just my perspective as an outsider.\n\nYou weren't mean at all. You were reiterating your feelings because your aunt was disrespecting your autonomy and your boundaries. It was absolutely not appropriate for her to be putting this pressure on you like this. She needs better coping mechanisms to deal with her infertility than harassing you for having your own bodily autonomy. And how was you clarifying that you don't want children not \"understanding\"? Her infertility has nothing to do with you. She said she'd be a good aunt if you had children, you then explained you didn't want children. There is nothing mean about that. \n\nAlso you should show your mother the messages from the conversation with your aunt if you haven't already.
