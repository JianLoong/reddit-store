And not having kids is an absolutely excellent choice... my child free friends have such amazing adventures!\n\n Your aunt needs counselling, her issues are not for you to take on. I have 2 kids, been through IVF and it takes a huge toll on mental health, esp if at the end of that you still don't have a child. I did resent people who missed treated kids or got pregnant with the whiff of sperm for a while bit managed to keep my mouth shut to anyone other than my ivf support group.

I have two nieces and I hope they live according to what they decide and deem best for themselves.", "NTA, the comments she made that insinuated that her real goal was to take care of said baby herself made me feel nauseous just thinking about it.", "NTA and I think you handled yourself very well.  Your aunt is struggling and I hope seeing a therapist to process her situation however it is not your responsibility to have a baby.

Luckily, my family isn't like this. I'm so sorry your aunt has said these things. But it is NOT your job to fulfill your aunt's desires to procreate. It is NOT a woman's job to procreate.

I'm with you - no thank you!", "NTA your body your choice. It isn't woman's work or duty to bring a child into this world.

Whether you decide to have children in the future or not is nobody's business but yours. It is really weird, and inappropriate to talk to someone your age about future children.

You should be thinking of high school and enjoying your teenage years not worrying about carrying children.\n\nMy daughter is 26 and chooses to be childfree.

It\u2019s absolutely true that some people aren\u2019t right for parenthood and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\n\nIt was beyond inappropriate for any adult to message a 16 year old about them having kids. Everything she said is inappropriate. No it\u2019s not your duty, no it\u2019s not some amazing gift for every woman. It\u2019s only that for women who *want* children.

As a woman who has never wanted kids for many of the same reasons as you, I completely get it.  There are huge red flags everywhere, obviously, but you don't EVER have to be \"understanding\" to anyone who wants to weirdly guilt you into birthing and raising an entire human.  It's simply not for everyone.  Like you, I know myself well enough to know that I would not be a great mom.  My sister has the patience of a saint, and she truly loves being a mom even during the really difficult parts, and I just know I have never had that in me.  And it's ok.\n\nYou did nothing wrong, and as long as your response wasn't hostile, you said nothing wrong.  It's perfectly normal to not want a child even though you happen to have a uterus.  What's not at ALL normal is to shame someone over a \"lack of maternal responsibility,\" whatever that means. Your aunt is the AH, clearly, but your mom kind of is too.

She's clearly having some type of mental break", "So your 37yo aunt is harassing you a 16 into having babies and your mom thinks you should be more understanding? NTA. She needs therapy.", "NTA, your aunt is being immature at best and emotionally abusive at worst. \n\nIt is very sad that she wants so much to be a mother but can't give birth. But you didn't make her infertile. You don't \"owe\" her a baby. \n\nWhat happened to you is she is taking out her trauma from infertility on you, a literal child. She needs therapy. \n\nYour mom is trying to \"keep the peace\" at the expense of your mental health. Lots of women are trained to give up their feelings and well being for the sake of the family. That may be an explanation, but it is not an excuse. \n\nIf your mom feels sorry for her, why didn't your mom ever offer to give birth to a baby and let her adopt it? Because that's what your aunt just blatantly asked you to do. \n\nI have an aunt who never had kids and at Thanksgiving every year she would get horribly drunk, bully everyone, then collapse crying and begging us to be nice to her husband and treat him like a dad because she can't give him kids. \n\nShe isn't even infertile, she just didn't have them young and didn't try because she felt she missed her chance. \n\nGuess what, there's lots of infertile people who don't go around saying awful things to their nieces, nephews, and niblings. \n\nYour aunt treating you this way shows a failure of her character, unrelated to her unfortunate medical condition. \n\nI recommend setting clear boundaries with her and your mom. They may not understand how fucked up they are treating you, they may not ever want to change, but you should hold true to yourself and know it is not your fault. \n\nSome people just treat others shitty because of their own issues.
