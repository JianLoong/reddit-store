{"id": 33393, "submission_id": "18mjegi", "title": "AITA for making no exceptions for a childfree wedding?", "selftext": "*All names are fake*\nMe (F 27) and my husband (30) got married last week. I have two brothers, \"Carl\" (33) and \"Jake\" (30) both married with two children. Jake children are 4 and 7 while Carl children are 6 and 8. I like spending time with my nephews, but most of the time Carl's children aren't able to behave, and I didn't want them to ruin the wedding, so me and my husband decided to not allowing child under 11 at our wedding. We said this six months before our wedding. So everyone had the time to find someone to look at their children. A week before the wedding Jake's babysitter got sick and he wasn't able to find anyone else. Fortunately Jake's wife(\"Kate\")'s sister, \"Hannah\" (17) decided that she would take care of them so my brother and his wife could attend the wedding (she was very happy since she find weddings boring and prefer stay at home playing with her nephews).\n\nDay of the wedding.\nEverything seemed to be ok until Carl and his wife came with their children, but some guests stops them. I went to see them and I reminded them that it's a child free wedding. They told me I didn't give enough notice (6 months) so they couldn't find a babysitter. I told Carl that the time was enough and he said that I should made an exception with family. Again, I told them no. It doesn't matter that they are my nephews, no children are allowed. Jake stepped out and reminded Carl that his children aren't there for the same reason and that he should stop acting like a child and let me have my moment. We start to fight until my parents tried to convince me to let Carl's children at the wedding, but I refuse again. So Carl and his wife accepted this, and said that they would take them to Jake and Kate's house. (Yes, \"said\", not \"asked\").\nKate and Jake refused, but Carl tried to convince them by saying that Hannah is already taking care of their children, so two more weren't a problem, and that they were ruining my wedding by refusing (funny that he said that). Carl then called Hannah in front of us, but she refused. Carl insisted for a while and then Hannah snapped saying that she will babysit them only after Carl and his wife will educated them, and when Carl replied that she is to young to understand how difficult is to be a parents is she told him to f- off. We fight for another hour until they decided to not be in my wedding.\n\nThe day after the wedding.\nCarl and his wife, my parents and most of my family say that I am the asshole for not making my nephews stay. And they are also saying that Hannah is an asshole too for not wanting to take care of her nephews (when they aren't her nephews at all) and for insulting my brother and sil. My brother and his wife (and her family) are on my side and my husband family too. But my family keep saying that I should've made an exception because all the family should have been at the ceremony.

I have kids and I would not be upset. You hire a sitter or one of the parents stay home. You do not however bring the kids and tell the couple to deal with it.\n\nIf you do want to bring your kids you teach them how to behave at events properly. People like Carl who do not parent their kids are why so many wedding are now child free.", "So since you\u2019ve had children you\u2019ve never gone to a nightclub or casino or on a rollercoaster with a height limit? Never went into a steam room or sauna? Went to an 18+ movie? You think the whole world should be family friendly? \n\nExpecting parents to find or hire a babysitter is a very reasonable demand. And if they can\u2019t, then one or both parents stays home (and I\u2019m sure they wouldn\u2019t be missed).", "How she the asshole??? No body else\u2019s kid were allowed to come not just carls she\u2019s allowed a limited kid wedding. She let in kids 11 and up. Younger kids wouldn\u2019t like weddings anyways. If anything you\u2019re probably one of those self entitled asshole parents who think they should get their way and make it everyone else issue just because you popped out a kid. They had 6 months to plan ahead to find a sitter not OP fault.", "They had six months to find child care. They didn\u2019t. They instead to tried to badger OP into making an exception for them. That was an unfair thing to do", "Neighborhood kids work really well. Or friends. Or you just send regrets and don't go. It's not at all unreasonable.\n\nAnd before you go off on \"you'll understand when you have kids\" I have two, the oldest of whom was excluded from my sister's wedding (the younger wasn't yet born). We hired someone to watch him. It's not that hard, especially with six months' notice.", "Their parents' reaction makes me think Carl is the golden child who has been raised to believe that he always deserves to be the main character in every event and that rules don't apply to him.", "Or the type that needs to be the center of attention, and make every event where they aren\u2019t a dramatic performance.", "Yea in my neighborhood, couples like these had an impossible time finding a babysitter. You burn one or two babysitters (either due to not paying them, not having them be disciplined enough or taking the kid\u2019s side over the babysitters over their own rules) at least once or twice and word will spread around to all the other babysitters. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the same couple who demanded their kids be invited to a child free wedding also had a hard time finding a babysitter.", "Probably, though I doubt they made any effort to hire one and intended to have the kids crash the wedding all along NTA", "\ud83d\ude0f Probably true"]}
