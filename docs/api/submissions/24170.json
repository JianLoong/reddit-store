We live on the other side of the country from her. She has three kids and they are my husband\u2019s only grandchildren so he is extremely happy to see her and spend time with his grandkids. \n\nThe problem is that she\u2019s a hustler. No matter what kind things we do for her (pay for vacation for them to meet us in the middle of the US, dinners, excursions etc\u2026) she always wants more. A Gucci purse was the last thing she guilted my husband into buying her- since he never payed child support for the 20+ years that he wasn\u2019t in her life, she feels like she deserves these things. \n\nIt seems like every time she\u2019s on the phone with him, she says \u201coh the grandkids miss you, when are you taking us to see you\u201d?  Or \u201cI really need a vacation\u201d. And he will send her money. He knows that I don\u2019t like that kind of pandering, but I try to ignore it. He is guilted into sending cash regularly for one thing or another. \n\nWe were able to put her off for a few years, but she flew down with her 3 kids on my husband\u2019s dime to stay with us for the weekend. I told him \u201cdo not buy any Gucci purses\u201d while she\u2019s here, and he said he learned his lesson and would not. \n\nWe took them to an amusement park, bounce parks, arcade and paid for all their food and expenses. I was pleasantly surprised that she didn\u2019t pander or ask for anything. Until the last day when we were sitting at lunch and a message pops up on her phone that says \u201cyour Amazon package has arrived\u201d and she says to her son \u201cthe bose headphones grandpa bought you just arrived at our house\u201d. \n\nMy husband doesn\u2019t have an Amazon account. She and the grandson hustled him into buying $200 Bose headphones, and took his credit card information and put it into her Amazon account while I was in the other room. I kept my cool at lunch, but later I politely told her that I wanted her to remove my husbands credit card from her Amazon account. \n\nI know what will happen. She will just ask for random things, (for example my husband bought his grandson a drum set from Amazon this past year after some guilting), and now that she has his cc number stored she will hit him up when I\u2019m not around. \n\nI know my husband can do whatever he wants with his money, and he feels guilty for not knowing his daughter for the first 20+ years of her life, but AITA for making him cancel the credit card that he put into her Amazon account? Am I overstepping? I just don\u2019t believe that she erased it, and I\u2019m not the kind of person to make her do it in front of me and cause a scene.

Regardless, it\u2019s not your place to make demands. Tell him how you feel and advise him. Remind him that any debt he acquires with her using his card is also your debt. Also keep in mind that even if she removes the card she likely still knows the card info and can just reinter it later. Your husband (not you) needs to discuss this with her. And, if he chooses to, I believe he can call the bank who issued his credit card and report strange activity and they will send him a new card and deactivate the old one.

Her getting money this way from him isn\u2019t appropriate but it\u2019s makes sense that she feels he owes her. Maybe your husband should sit up college funds for his grandchildren or something. Also, if it helps your husband to feel good to buy them things why do you care so much?

Can OP guarantee that didn't happen?\n\nOP needs to sit down with husband, establish limits for daughter's family in the context of everything husband expects to do.

My grandpa never paid child support and was paying it to my grandma till his death when all his kids were in their 50s. So skating by till a kid is 18 even if you don\u2019t know about them without paying any support does not absolve you from financial obligation to the kid. \n\nSo yeah YTA for thinking this girl is actually owed nothing.

Even if she is as skilled at manipulation as you claim, your husband is still choosing to make a *choice* to spend these funds. You and he need to have a sit down conversation and outline what gift-protocols you are comfortable with: birthdays? holidays? spending limits. etc. Then he needs to stick to your agreement and not deviate, no matter how much she wheedles.", "NTA. You say in a comment your husband never knew about her. That is her *mother's* fault, not his. While I understand wanting to do things for her, the fact she is guilting him by saying he never paid child support is disingenuous and morally fraudulent. \n\nHer mother did not file for the money her child should have gotten. That ship sailed a very, very long time ago. He owes her precisely nothing, thanks to her *mother*.\n\nHonestly? I'd cancel the credit card. Insist on a completely new number, not just a reissue of the old number with a new code on the back. Someone who will twist the knife in a blameless person will absolutely have made a note of that credit card information. \n\nThe way to at least reduce the chance of him doing it again is to have him get his own Amazon account, or if you already have one, add him to yours. \n\nUltimately, he needs to grow a spine and start shutting her down when she tries to say he \"owes\" her.

Grandchildren?", "NTA- This affects your credit as well.", "NTA, the daughter knows what she\u2019s doing and she\u2019s stealing his money in a way.

And he may be happy to buy them things at this point in his life. If your finances are separate and he's not in a bad place financially, you may need to back off. If that's not the case, consider him defining the amount he's willing to give her every year and set up an account for her, or a debit card with access to limited funds.

YTA in this case.\n But if he spends equal to or more than he earns, then NTA.", "INFO: Has your husband explicitly said he doesn\u2019t want to buy her stuff? \n\nHe is a grown man who probably feels a lot of guilt, if he wants to splurge on her and the grandkids to atone i\u2019m not sure what the problem is.", "NTA, with limits. Would you be legally liable for any credit card debt she incurs? Is he spending marital funds, or his own? It's fine to protect your own finances. His, less so.\n\nShe may be a user, but your husband has good ethics. It wasn't her fault that her mother did not request child support. He did have a responsibility, even if he didn't know it. Expensive presents are not the best way to \"reimburse\" for that though. \n\nPlease take him to a financial adviser. Have him decide on a reasonable amount.

I would tell him no and he would insist but never in front of his wife. She may have asked for things in front of you that he already mentioned doing for her. You may not know what is really going on. \nJust consider that please.

I'd suggest coming up with a budget for him to spend on his daughter and grandkids and sticking to it. You're absolutely right that her having access to a credit card is a no go. She should not be able to put him into debt. Honestly, the child support argument is irrelevant here. That money would have gone to her mother to pay bills, not to her for Gucci purses.
