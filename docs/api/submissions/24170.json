We live on the other side of the country from her. She has three kids and they are my husband\u2019s only grandchildren so he is extremely happy to see her and spend time with his grandkids. \n\nThe problem is that she\u2019s a hustler. No matter what kind things we do for her (pay for vacation for them to meet us in the middle of the US, dinners, excursions etc\u2026) she always wants more. A Gucci purse was the last thing she guilted my husband into buying her- since he never payed child support for the 20+ years that he wasn\u2019t in her life, she feels like she deserves these things. \n\nIt seems like every time she\u2019s on the phone with him, she says \u201coh the grandkids miss you, when are you taking us to see you\u201d?  Or \u201cI really need a vacation\u201d. And he will send her money. He knows that I don\u2019t like that kind of pandering, but I try to ignore it. He is guilted into sending cash regularly for one thing or another. \n\nWe were able to put her off for a few years, but she flew down with her 3 kids on my husband\u2019s dime to stay with us for the weekend. I told him \u201cdo not buy any Gucci purses\u201d while she\u2019s here, and he said he learned his lesson and would not. \n\nWe took them to an amusement park, bounce parks, arcade and paid for all their food and expenses. I was pleasantly surprised that she didn\u2019t pander or ask for anything. Until the last day when we were sitting at lunch and a message pops up on her phone that says \u201cyour Amazon package has arrived\u201d and she says to her son \u201cthe bose headphones grandpa bought you just arrived at our house\u201d. \n\nMy husband doesn\u2019t have an Amazon account. She and the grandson hustled him into buying $200 Bose headphones, and took his credit card information and put it into her Amazon account while I was in the other room. I kept my cool at lunch, but later I politely told her that I wanted her to remove my husbands credit card from her Amazon account. \n\nI know what will happen. She will just ask for random things, (for example my husband bought his grandson a drum set from Amazon this past year after some guilting), and now that she has his cc number stored she will hit him up when I\u2019m not around. \n\nI know my husband can do whatever he wants with his money, and he feels guilty for not knowing his daughter for the first 20+ years of her life, but AITA for making him cancel the credit card that he put into her Amazon account? Am I overstepping? I just don\u2019t believe that she erased it, and I\u2019m not the kind of person to make her do it in front of me and cause a scene.

If the missed child supposed is the reasoning she gives you then your husband should be contacting the person that raised her and give them money. They are the ones that actually had to financially support the child without his help. She did nothing but exist. If he would have paid that money she wouldn\u2019t have had Gucci bags as a kid.

He\u2019s a dick for not paying child support for 20 years and as a result has a daughter who seeks retribution. I imagine the Gucci purses and occasional trips still don\u2019t add up to 20 years of child support. But he does need to eventually get a grip and stop parenting with guilt. Regardless, it\u2019s not your place to make demands. Tell him how you feel and advise him. Remind him that any debt he acquires with her using his card is also your debt. Also keep in mind that even if she removes the card she likely still knows the card info and can just reinter it later. Your husband (not you) needs to discuss this with her. And, if he chooses to, I believe he can call the bank who issued his credit card and report strange activity and they will send him a new card and deactivate the old one.

You sound resentful and don\u2019t seem to like the step daughter and grandchildren and I\u2019m sure your everyone can sense this.

You keep referring to her \"guilting\" and \"hustling\" when in fact she's asking and he's giving.

He is not and never was legally this woman's father.\n\nThat said, if he wants to help there are better ways of going about it than buying Gucci purses or putting his CC info on this woman's Amazon account for her shopping sprees.  One of the best is to open a 529 account in each grandchild's name, as a grandparent to grandchild beneficiary 529 account is not reportable on FAFSA, and funds remaining in the account can be rolled to a Roth IRA for the beneficiary after a certain amount of time.", "The bigger issue is that your husband did not support her and did not pay child support for years. Her getting money this way from him isn\u2019t appropriate but it\u2019s makes sense that she feels he owes her. Maybe your husband should sit up college funds for his grandchildren or something. Also, if it helps your husband to feel good to buy them things why do you care so much? He missed out on years of birthday gifts, holidays etc. Canceling the credit card is one thing but you sound jealous of your husband\u2019s relationship with his daughter and grandchildren.", "Asking the daughter to remove the CC number from her Amazon account could be a waste of time - what makes you think the daughter didn't separately record it for other purposes? Can OP guarantee that didn't happen?\n\nOP needs to sit down with husband, establish limits for daughter's family in the context of everything husband expects to do. Does husband expect to fund the grandchildren's college education? What are the limits on this? How will that impact his and OP's retirement and other financial goals?\n\nWhatever the limits are, establish them, then hold him to them.\n\nWe're going to spend $X per year, perhaps separately fund it into a separate bank account on a yearly basis.

This is not her mother, this is her fathers wife. A father who knowingly or not took no part in the majority of her life. Do you honestly, and I mean it, do you honestly think this won\u2019t backfire and daughter doesn\u2019t blame OP for interfering in what little relationship she has with her father? Whether or not it\u2019s true, basically accusing her of taking advantage of the man is going to insult her(again even in my opinion I think she\u2019s using him for $). My point is ONLY that there is a better way to get this situation away from financially dangerous, that doesn\u2019t involve her becoming the bad guy.", "I wasn't getting my point across clearly, sorry.\n\nBasically, the check is for the child's needs, but the parent is in charge of it. Spending it frivously can be a criminal offense.
