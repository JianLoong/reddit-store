{"id": 17416, "submission_id": "13jesc7", "title": "AITA for wanting to read Harry Potter to my daughter?", "selftext": "My wife and I are fighting right now over my reading aloud to my daughter.  My daughter is 8 years old and I am currently on the third Harry Potter book with her, we started reading them together last year.  I have explained to my wife that it brings me joy and my daughter likes me to read to her, it is bonding time between her and I.  My wife wants my daughter to be reading at her reading level  books that my daughter has picked out.  She wants my daughter to not be dependent on me reading to her.  At school her math is her best score, grammar and reading our average in the class.  \n\nThis came to a head last night when I had gone to the park with my daughters and came back home and my 8 year old wanted me to read Harry Potter to her.  My wife brought up the normal complaints that my daughter should read on her own.  My wife is upset that my daughter has not been motivated to read her library books that she brought home from school.  My wife states that the only reading source that she wants is Harry Potter at nightime.  \n\nI was upset because I feel like this is my time with my daughter.   I sometimes work nights, and my wife state's my daughter gets whiny when she doesn't have Dad reading to her at night.  She states that my daughter didn't want to finish her library books unless my wife is strict with her to read the books.  My daughter has just finished an 11 chapter book and wanted to have the whole series.  \n\nI believe that reading to my daughter is good for bonding and doesn't diminish her reading time on her own.  AITA for stating that I will continue reading to her even if my wife wants it to stop.  My wife thinks I am creating a dependent reader and it is my taste not my daughters, fyi I have never read Harry Potter.  Is it worth it to give up the bonding and reading time with my daughter to trade for my daughter independent reading?", "created_utc": 1684265506, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13jesc7/aita_for_wanting_to_read_harry_potter_to_my/", "score": 1275, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am refusing to stop reading aloud to my daughter despite my wife insisting that I stop.  2. I am insisting and not giving up because I believe it is the right thing to do.  My wife does have a point about my daughter needing to read on her own.  She believes some of this is selfish on my part because of the bonding.  My wife thinks that this will be detrimental to my daughter's growth and she may be right.

You're helping your daughter get a live of books.  You're bonding.  You're spending good time together.  You are not hurting her reading ability in any way.", "NTA. Some of my fondest memories of my dad as a child are him reading to me at night. It\u2019s a beautiful thing to share. \n\nI hope your wife doesn\u2019t put your daughter off reading by being overly strict. A lot of people stop reading as adults because they think of it as a punishment or something they have to do. Creating fond memories around reading will likely create a more long-term relationship with books. \n\nHaving said that maybe there\u2019s a middle ground that can be come to. Maybe time can be pre-arranged for when your daughter is going to do independent reading and when you are going to read to her. You could create a schedule based on your work schedule and then your daughter knows what\u2019s happening what night.", "You reading to her doesn't mean she can't read other books as well at other moments.\n\nI think it's great you have a bonding father child moment together.\n\nPerhaps your wife feels left out.\n\nNTA", "Your wife is going to kill any joy your daughter might ever feel for reading with that attitude. You can't FORCE someone to read and love books, you can only help them associate it with happy emotions. When you're done with HP, try the Percy Jackson books \ud83d\ude0a there's like 10 of them across the two series \ud83d\ude08\n\nNTA", "NTA, my dad read the Hobbit to me when I was 8 and it hasn't stopped me being a massive bookworm. I'm curious to know how she feels about audiobooks?", "NTA\n\nMy mom reading the first Harry Potter books to me as a kid was exactly what got me to read the rest of them on my own. Your daughter won't always want to be read to, I'd cherish the time you still have to do that.", "Judgement added - are you doing anything to encourage her to read on her own too?\n\nYTA.", "NAH. \n\nI agree with both of you.  I think it is very important for your daughter to be able to read on her own, and to have confidence in that reading ability for her own self-esteem. I also think father and daughter bonding time is extremely important. \n\nIf she is refusing to read her own books, then why don\u2019t you make the nighttime reading a condition? She has to read one chapter from her own book for every chapter you with read with her\u2026or something to that effect.  The point is, she needs to do both and you can use the nighttime reading as leverage or introduce some other consequence if she ignores her own reading time.", "NTA. Some of my fondest childhood memories are of being read to. I love reading and naturally grew into reading on my own. What your doing is excellent bonding time!\n\nMy kids\u2019 dad read to them well into high school as part of dad/daughter time and all three enjoy reading on their own. \n\nYour wife needs to chill out. Your daughter wants time with her dad.", "NTA\n\nAn idea to satisfy her could be to let her read a sentence and switch back and forth\n\nOrrrrrr in the morning or afternoon, you ask her to read to you (kids like to feel included and needed)", "NTA.  My mom used to read to us every night before bedtime, and once I found a genre I liked to read on my own, I never came up for air.  Lol.  My mom has been gone for over 40 years, and it is still one of my fondest memories.  If she keeps it up, she is going to make your daughter hate reading anything because she is making it a point of contention.", "NTA. As a daughter who grew up with a father who exposed me to books like Harry Potter, would read to me and take me to the bookstore/library, it\u2019s an incredibly special thing you\u2019re doing for your child. \n\nAll of my best memories are doing those things with my dad. I\u2019ll also add that up until reading became a part of my job, I was such an avid bookworm that I\u2019d get in trouble for reading late at night. Keep it up. You\u2019re helping a little girl foster a love for stories and spending quality time with her that she\u2019ll never forget.", "Literacy teacher here with two comments. \n\n1. Reading to your daughter is wonderful! She associates reading with special time with you, and nothing fosters an appreciation of reading more than connecting it with a positive emotion. Also, you can read significantly more rigorous books to your daughter than she can read herself. This expands her vocabulary and helps her build background. \n\n2. Your daughter should also read independently. She does need to practice decoding and making meaning from the written word. We suggest at least 15 minutes per night of independent reading. \n\nTry to combine both of these practices, and your daughter will thrive. Best to you!", "NTA. I read at night with both my girls even now and one is 14 and one is 17. They both read different things alone - we read magic and fantasy (think Percy Jackson and similar) together but my eldest will read biographies alone and my youngest likes demon type adventures alone.  I love the closeness it brings plus it allows them quiet time with just me, and they will often bring up a worry or stress at this time because it is our time. Any reading is positive, expanding vocabulary and using your imagination (early on we read a book about a parrot and had a discussion about what that parrot looked like - for me red and blue, for her yellow and white!). Plus that one to one time with a parent who cares and who protects that time is so precious and valuable to them. \n\nI cannot ever see how one to one reading time with their parent can be negative.", "At 8, her fluency and ability to sound out words may still need developing, so she SHOULD be practicing reading aloud. \n\nI love reading to my kid and cannot wait to read Harry Potter to him if he lets me. That part isn't what makes you wrong here.\n\nWhere you're going wrong is not encouraging her to read aloud at all. Reading aloud is a skill that needs developing separately than \"a general love of reading\". You are doing the fun part and disregarding the part that is hard work and more effort. \n\nYou can love to read, but then if you're asked to do read aloud at school and you stumble on words and struggle to pronounce words (not saying she does this), that can damage your confidence, damage your love of reading, and affect your grades too as you grow up.", "My ex's mother had that same attitude----that you don't read to children after they can read independently. As a teacher and as a mother, that is absolutely wrong. Reading TO children fosters a love of readinging, positive feelings and relationships, and increases vocabulary. Those will translate to a love of reading on her own. There are loads of studies that confirm being read to is a positive. NTA.", "NTH Reading to kids is so good for, like, every aspect of human existence! I remember going to a friend's house in 6th grade (Yes! We were 12!) and her dad was still reading to her, I was like ew weird and then reversed my opinion very quickly when I was treated to an amazing reading of A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court that is now a treasured memory. How lucky she was to have such a loving parent who shared his love of reading with her! \n\nYou are teaching your child to read for pleasure, which is such a gift. Please ignore anyone who demands that you focus on improving academic reading instead. Being read to is so lovely, and such a good opportunity to have good discussions with our kids! Oh, what would you have done in this character's situation? How do you think they perceive this person who has X experience? What do you think will happen next? \n\nReading together is a way to show love, share experiences, and yes also learn. It's a great way to relax at bedtime. Never stop.", "My son and I read the entire HP series out loud.  He is all grown now, but I still cherish that time.  It is one of my fondest memories.\n\nEdit: NTA!", "PLEASE don't stop. In college, I did a research fellowship on the psychological benefits of reading books to children. It's good for your daughter, it encourages a love of story and reading, and provides really wonderful bonding. It's also a way to bring up difficult concepts to discuss with your child and help them figure out the world -- make sure that after/during reading, you talk to your daughter about what you just read and what she thinks about it. If there are any ambiguous messages, you can help clear those up.", "ESH - except your daughter of course. Your wife should support your bonding time but has a legitimate concern. You are ignoring her legitimate concern and admit you\u2019ve made no attempt to even gently encourage your daughter read more. \n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, there are some pretty well discussed criticisms of the Harry Potter series and it\u2019s author that are pretty widely known. I grew up as a huge Harry Potter fan and you couldn\u2019t pay me to support that author in any capacity (financially or otherwise) and I will not be introducing the little ones in my life to the series. There are rampant issues with racism, anti-Semitism, misogyny, and the normalization of slavery. I just feel as though there is loads of better content easy to access and I\u2019m surprised you\u2019d chose HP in this day and age when there are far better options. (You have a daughter, she deserves better than a book where all of the female characters are treated so shabbily, it doesn\u2019t affect my judgement but as a woman and a reader I implore you to do some research on what series you select for her. Kids are impacted by the stories they hear and incorporate them into their expectations in life.)", "NAH. \n\n\nI think you are creating lovely memories with your daughter and that's invaluable. Please don't stop reading to her. \n\n\nHowever, I also believe your wife has a point. Your daughter also needs to read on her own, specially if she is falling behind on the books requested by her school. \n\n\nFinding a solution seems extremely easy, though. I'm 36. I was 11 when I began reading Harry Potter. Like your daughter, I was hooked. However, I had to wait YEARS for all the books to come out. I would re-read the books and anything remotely similar in between. \n\n\nYou should use her Harry Potter love to her advantage. Things you could try:\n\n\n- You read 1 chapter out loud + she reads the next one out loud + additional chapter on her own. \n\n\n- You read the series to her... But she gets to read all the additional related books on her own. From Quidditch to Magical creatures, there are a lot of books set in the same universe that would help her cope with her potter thirst until you read the main books together. \n\n\n- You can only read some Harry Potter after she has caught up with the books she need to read for school - if any. Homework before pleasure.\n\n\nHowever, the best thing you can do to encourage your daughter to read is READING a lot in front of her. Some of my fondest memories are rainy days spent together reading on the living room. My parents, my brother and I - each in one sofa, each reading a different book. Endless hours of shared quiet. We would always pack a book to go in holidays too. And my favourite (and something I plan on doing with my own kids): the book exception. We were given toys for Xmas and our Bdays only, but we could always get a new book. \n\n\nAll of that defined our love for reading.", "NAH\n\nBoth of you are wrong and correct. Your daughter needs independent reading. Have her read to you first before you read to her. Or make reading 30 minutes after school a condition to you reading HP. If she doesn't read on her own, you make her read to you before bed. Being read to is good, but she has to read for herself too.", "Some of my favorite memories is reading to my kids. NTA!", "NTA. My dad started reading me Harry Potter when I was 8 and they are some of the fondest memories I have.", "NTA reading to them was one of my greatest pleasures when my kids where younger and something I miss terribly. \n\nMaybe have your daughter read her comprehension book to you before you read to her in order to placate your wife?", "NTA. I also read the series to/with my daughter starting around age 8. One difference; I didn\u2019t do 100% of the reading. Early on, I\u2019d read about 4-6 pages, then have her read half a page to me. Soon, that became a full page, then several pages, and eventually we would just take turns reading chapters to each other. (I guess she was about 11-12 by then). Those are memories I wouldn\u2019t trade.", "NTA and I commend you for introducing your child to the love of books! She\u2019s 8, she has lots of time to get better at reading by herself, but at the same time being read to is SO great from a bonding perspective, and for a new reader, it\u2019s nice to just get lost in the story and not have to focus on your brain working so hard. You\u2019re a great parent. \n\nAlso, I\u2019ll add I\u2019m a very proficient reader and love to read books myself, but guess who read Harry Potter to me? My mom. She started reading it to me in 1997 and she CONTINUED TO READ THEM TO ME until the last book dropped in 2007. Do the math and you\u2019ll understand I was well beyond an age of needing anyone to read to me haha. It is a great way for a parent to spend time with their kids. Some of my favourite memories!", "NTA. Just an idea though (it's what my mum did with me) let her read a page out loud to you, you read the next one or the next two pages, then one page her, you the next two etc. She gets to hear the story and practice her reading. I know I hated it the first time but pretty quickly I got way faster with reading and we even switched to one chapter each after a few months.", "NTA. Educator here: ALL READING IS GOOD. Independent reading, family reading, kid\u2019s level, above kid\u2019s level, fiction, non-fiction, silent reading, reading aloud, being read to, academic reading, reading for fun, reading a book, reading online. ALL READING IS GOOD.", "There is an easy solution to this. Before you read HP tonight, have your daughter read aloud to you from her library book\u2014a few pages will do. You can tell her you want to hear her story, too. Snuggle, give enthusiastic feedback, etc. Then tell her how much you loved it. Then it\u2019s your turn to read to her. Tomorrow, ask her to catch you up on what she read at school, and then have her pick up from there and read a few more pages to you, and then it\u2019s your turn to read. And so on. You will make this a big win.", "NTA. Your wife is being extremely weird and unhelpful. Reading with you will only make her love reading and inspire her to read more on her own. I assume you also help her with her own reading and have her read to you sometimes, if not you should do that as well. But your wife either has very wrong ideas about how learning works, or is jealous of your bond with your daughter and trying to sabotage it.\n\nIf her worry was the content, I\u2019d say it\u2019d be reasonable to take a break from reading at the end of book four until she\u2019s a little older, but it doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s the issue at all. Let Goblet of Fire end with Cedric and Harry taking the cup together and revisit what happens next a tad later \ud83d\ude2c", "Uh, the 4th trough 7th book is not something that I would read in that age bracket\u2026 NTA but please consider reading something else.", "Okay, so, taking the fact that it's HP out of the question: \n\nI can understand both sides here. It is wonderful to read to your child, but you should also be encouraging her to read on her own. I am positive that there are books at her reading level that will catch her attention just as much, if not more. Maybe looking into that would help.", "ESH.\n\nYou don't appear to be adequately encouraging her to develop her independent reading skills, making your wife the \"bad guy\" in all interactions around reading. That's not cool.\n\nYour wife is an AH for trying to make you stop a perfectly normal, lovely parent-child interaction instead of finding an actual solution. \n\nWhat you *should* be doing is finding a way to get your HP time while also ensuring your daughter is reading independently an adequate amount. Could you switch off who reads the chapters aloud? Or could she read you one of her books every other night instead? Maybe you and she could have a book club where you sit down at night once a week and discuss the books she's reading, maybe have tea and cookies or something, make it a fun little faux-grown-up ritual? \n\nThere are solutions here that support your daughter's reading development while also keeping your bonding time intact. Find them!", "NTA. But switch up - you read one chapter aloud, your daughter the next chapter.", "Nta and this is really a important time between you and your daughter. However you can say \"you have to read your school book before bedtime if you want me to read to you tonight\" and make sure she does it. Why make your wife be the bad guy?", "Is your wife jealous about other things you do with your daughter?\n\nTake it from someone who is in their 30s and still remembers being read to by their Dad as a kid. I treasure those memories so much.\n\nNTA. Continue being a great Dad.", "NTA. One of the best ways to spark the joy of reading in a young child is reading out loud together. Combine reading out loud something you are both excited to read with the child reading to you from books at their current reading level, and you have a surefire way to build an eager and enthusiastic lover of books. You are going about this in the right way and building memories for your daughter.", "NTA, but I think you should dive into the relationship with your wife. It seems like y'all talk but don't come to a resolution, and then you wrote this whole post and only said \"my\" daughter, not \"our\" daughter. Maybe she is only your daughter biologically, but you, your wife, and your daughter are some type of family, and should be cohesive.", "NTA. You can't force a kid to like reading and taking away a form of reading she enjoys (you reading to her) and forcing other reading activities on her is just going to make her dislike it more.\n\nShe can do independent reading and still have her time with you. Your wife does not end to take that away. You could even try switching who reads each night.", "NTA, but how about a compromise: daughter reads you one of her library books each night before you read HP?", "NTA. My mom read Harry Potter to me when I was young too. Some of my best memories. Your habit will encourage your daughters love of reading, not hinder it.", "NTA but you might consider setting the boundary that Harry Potter reading is for after her school reading, including library books. \n\nBtw, reading to a child above their reading level and discussing the story with them can help them develop into advanced readers.", "My dad read me bed time stories until I was 11, the brave man even ventured into vampire books for me. He got back scratches and his hair combed in return.\n\nI went from around age 11-13 not really caring about books but then I found my genre and got really into reading, still am.\n\nBed time stories do not damage a child's ability/willingness to read. nta", "NTA. Continue reading to your daughter but ensure she is reading her books as well so she does well in her reading at school. \n\nWe have 2 kids 13 and 10. They have to read for 30 minutes when they get home from school while they have a snack. It has to be a book and not anything on their phones or computers. Then before bed I read to them a few chapters from a book I have chosen. I really like the Rex Dexter books because they are funny! Baked Potato! This helps them with their language skills just as much as reading on their own. Also, the bonding! \n\nI will say I am jealous that your child wants you to read Harry Potter. My kids could care less about that story because they have watched some of the movies. Those books were my getaway when I was a teenager and I named my first two cats Winkie and Doby.", "Absolutely NTA \n\nThere is rarely a time when reading isn't beneficial! The only thing I suggest is that you could maybe take it chapter each? That would also show you (& your wife) that she was really comprehending the story and you could help her with any tricky words", "NTA. Any educator will tell you that reading with your children is a key component of literacy development AND it's a wonderful bonding moment for parents and children to have together. You can look up plenty of studies about this too.\n\nThat being said, you *should* investigate why she doesn't choose to read on her own - is there a specific thing that is making it challenging? Are they too hard or too easy? Is she not interested in the topic? Is there a chance there's something undiagnosed going on, like needing glasses, or dyslexia? Does she have a space she feels comfortable reading in at home that has minimal distractions? \n\nYou would become TA if you don't get to the bottom of her resistance to solo reading, and you should encourage her to read outside of bedtime as well but overall this is wonderful and no one should make you feel bad about this, least of all your wife.", "I mean, what's her argument for audiobooks and podcasts? NTA", "Your wife is misinformed. It has been shown again and again that it is beneficial for children to be read to.", "I\u2019m going to go with NAH. You and your wife have your hearts in the right place, but I think your wife is going about it in the wrong way.\n\nI am an elementary school teacher, and have taught students exactly your daughter\u2019s age. Students who love to read become good readers, regardless of the \u201clevel\u201d or topic they are reading. Part of encouraging your kids to love reading is having positive experiences around books with them.\n\nIt is important for your daughter to eventually learn to read a variety of texts on her own, and I understand your wife\u2019s concern that Harry Potter is the only reading she wants to do right now. That is normal for kids, and her tastes will likely expand as she gets older and is exposed to more types of books. Shutting your Harry Potter time down now will likely just make her resent having to read on her own, and reading to her will not hurt her progress. If anything, exposure to books more difficult than what she\u2019s able to read alone will prepare her to read harder books. If you wanted to get her more involved in the process, you could switch off and have her read out loud occasionally, or ask her questions as you go to build reading comprehension skills.", "NTA. Librarian here. You\u2019re doing a great thing by reading to your daughter and bonding with her over storytelling. If mom is concerned about your daughter not engaging in independent reading, perhaps you can take a trip to the library with your daughter and ask the staff about books that are similar to Harry Potter (aka fantasy). Then ask her to choose some books that she is interested in and you can make it another, perhaps weekly, activity that she reads to you or she reads solo and then tells you about what she read. Maybe ask her to make it as big and dramatic as possible so it\u2019s an activity and fun. I think you can do that in addition to your bedtime reading, it doesn\u2019t have to be either/or.", "NAH. It\u2019s great for you to have this bonding time, but your wife is right, she needs to read on her own as well. You should encourage her to read on her own. Or maybe let her read some of Harry Potter to you. \n\nFYI, the Harry Potter books start to get pretty dark after POA. Even as an adult, some of it can be pretty unsettling.", "NTA because this is really sweet. Just an idea but why don't you do a trade? You read a page and then have your daughter read a page back to you? That way you are still bonding.", "NTA for reading to your daughter. \n\nHow about she reads for 20 minutes on her own before you read to her each night?", "There has been a TON of research on this to support you.

I read aloud to my stepchild for as long as they\u2019d allow it (into their teens) and intend to do the same with my daughter, I\u2019ve been reading to her since the day she was born and at 19 months she loves books more than Anything and can request them by title.\n\nYou sound like a great dad, I am not sure where your wife\u2019s concerns stem from, but perhaps have a chat with a paediatrician to help her understand that this will not impede your daughter\u2019s development.\n\nEdit: NTA", "Why don't you have your daughter read aloud to you?", "It doesn't have to be mutually exclusive. \n\nNTA", "NTA - I\u2019ve read my wife to sleep almost every night for the last 13 years. When our girls were born, I knew I\u2019d read to them too. I read to them just about every night at bedtime. I do all the voices (they especially loved my Dumbledore voice). I get a special joy when they can identify the character by my voice before the book does (Oooo, Snape!). They are both voracious reader and my reading to them has only encouraged that. \n\nRead on, my friend. Read on.", "I am 45 and my brother is a few years older. When I was about 8 my mom read my brother and I the Hobbit and all 3 Lord of the Rings books. It is a precious memory and we knew how to read. It was about sharing the story together.", "NTA.

You say she's just finished an 11 chapter book but your wife says she's not reading unless your wife is pressuring her. Pressuring her isn't going to encourage her to want to read on her own. Perhaps think of some other ways that you guys can encourage her. It doesn't need to be either or. Perhaps your daughter could pick a book that she reads to you in the evenings. You could trade off days. That way you still get that special time together but she's developing her written, oral and reading comprehension skills.", "It's lovely that you are bonding with your daughter. Why not take turns reading? You read to her one night, then she reads to you the next.", "NAH. This is a core memory! Totally apart from the fact that she is indeed fostering a love of reading and enhancing literacy skills, she will always remember this time with dad.

A good compromise would be that you take turns reading to each other. She reads a paragraph and you read a paragraph, until the chapter is done. This is great because you are able to catch what words she has trouble with (pronunciation and vocabulary lesson) as well as any reading issues she has. \n\nI did this with my nephew and I was able to quickly see that he speed reads, to the point where he doesn\u2019t even absorb the information and if he doesn\u2019t know the word he either skips it or substitutes it for a word he does know even if it entirely changes the meaning of the sentence.

I got bedtime stories until fifth grade and in my thirties I still miss them. We shared Harry Potter against my moms wishes (she's of the HP is satanic mindset). Those moments are so deeply treasured to me that I have a HP tattoo in honor of my dad. \n\nYour wife may be more annoyed at the trouble she's having with the fallout when you're not home than the actual bedtime story ritual. I think she knows it would be wrong to ask you not to read to the kid for \"no reason\" so she's clinging to this idea of the books being bad for daughter in some way so she feels less guilty asking. \n\nYou don't need to stop reading to your kiddo, you need her to not be a nuisance when mom is in charge of bedtime. Talk to the kid. Tell her storytime means a lot to you and you want to keep continuing them but that you need her help behaving when you're not home for bed.  She can help you come up with a solution. \n\nMaybe you can record yourself reading a few of her favorite shorter books so she can listen to one when you're not home. Or maybe those days are her turn to read to you over the phone if possible while you work. \n\nI felt so so special when my pops seemed interested in books I like. Perhaps she'd like it if those nights she got to read to herself before bed and then later yall talk about the book she's reading.  My dad would occasionally see me reading and ask \"ooh what's that about?\" And listen for ages while I try to explain the book. He'd ask questions about points in the plot as I explained and sometimes \"what do you think will happen next?\" then later he'd ask if I was right.  He didn't truly care about the stories themselves, I'm sure.  But he made me think he did. So I was always excited to read on my own so I could tell him about it. And he was sneakily making me think about what I was reading and was practicing my abilities to retell things which really came in handy doing reports in my later grades.", "The Harry Potter books for you are an important part of your childhood and they helped turned you --- and millions of other kids ---  into readers.  I think that's very wholesome in and of itself, and I think the HP series is a great way for kids to ease their way into reading bigger novels. \n\nHOWEVER, I do think that when the time its right, you should talk to her about JK Rowling's transphobia and some problematic elements that arise within the books, such as the Gringotts goblins and how they relate to antisemitism, along with the Death Eaters and how their quest to hunt people who weren't \"purebloods\" is problematic.  Its kind of like reading old literature.  We can appreciate some aspects of it while acknowledging the problematic elements.\n\nI think you are NTA", "So, broadly NTA, but I will also relate what I was told by an educator on the subject specifically about Harry Potter:\n\nThey are books intended for 5th graders. Same with things like Narnia, Redwall, etc. I was in a similar place of being SUPER eager to share those stories with my eldest, and I was cautioned that it can be counter productive to skip ahead to Harry Potter and similar books because they miss out on building the reading skills and things that come from reading more age-appropriate books/having them read to them. \n\nThere's a lot of great, more age appropriate stuff out there. Bunnicula, Sideways Stories from Wayside High, Matilda, etc. And just buckets of Amelia Bedilia, Junie B Jones, etc. \n\nSo, read to your daughter. Even read stuff that's .maybe a little advanced for her. But don't skip to books that are 5th-8th grade (by the end of the series). It's hard, I know. But it also pays off. My 10 year old devours books now. We're going to start Harry Potter this summer, after putting if off, and we're super excited to do that together. \n\nAlso, since I love plugging it, check out Aaron Becker's books Journey, Quest, and Return. They're absolutely brilliant. Completely wordless, but tells a really great story with beautiful art, and it's fascinating to watch a kid decipher it and relate it to you.", "NTA.  Reading to your kid is associated with better reading skills.

There are a lot of great ideas out there.\n\nEdited to add a suggestion- maybe get one of the Septimus Heap books and ask your kid to read one paragraph or page to you before you guys switch to you reading Harry Potter? The Septimus Heap series is much easier to read, and a kid who likes Harry Potter might enjoy them.  You can find some ways to help your kid read actively without losing your excellent reading time together.", "NAH it\u2019s literally a children\u2019s book. I was reading it when I was 6 years old.

I think the real issue is your wife is jealous that you're getting that bonding time.", "NTA, but I suggest that you and your daughter could start to share reading, trading off pages or chapters.

My daughter is 8 years old and I am currently on the third Harry Potter book with her, we started reading them together last year.  I have explained to my wife that it brings me joy and my daughter likes me to read to her, it is bonding time between her and I.  My wife wants my daughter to be reading at her reading level  books that my daughter has picked out.  She wants my daughter to not be dependent on me reading to her.  At school her math is her best score, grammar and reading our average in the class.  This came to a head last night when I had gone to the park with my daughters and came back home and my 8 year old wanted me to read Harry Potter to her.  My wife brought up the normal complaints that my daughter should read on her own.  My wife is upset that my daughter has not been motivated to read her library books that she brought home from school.  My wife states that the only reading source that she wants is Harry Potter at nightime.  I was upset because I feel like this is my time with my daughter.   I sometimes work nights, and my wife state's my daughter gets whiny when she doesn't have Dad reading to her at night.  She states that my daughter didn't want to finish her library books unless my wife is strict with her to read the books.  My daughter has just finished an 11 chapter book and wanted to have the whole series.  I believe that reading to my daughter is good for bonding and doesn't diminish her reading time on her own.  AITA for stating that I will continue reading to her even if my wife wants it to stop.  My wife thinks I am creating a dependent reader and it is my taste not my daughters, fyi I have never read Harry Potter.  Is it worth it to give up the bonding and reading time with my daughter to trade for my daughter independent reading?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

As a children\u2019s librarian, I can tell you that reading with your daughter is one of the best things you can do as a parent. Period. Not only are you bonding but she is also gaining literacy skills, even if she\u2019s only listening. Some notes for your wife:\n\n- the official reading level of Harry Potter is 4-7th grade. That\u2019s ages 9 and up. Your daughter is old enough to listen and soon to read it on her own if she wishes. But she likes reading with you! Maybe she can read a few passages to you too in the future.  Also, reading levels are guidelines not rules. A child who has higher reading comprehension or reads with an adult can absolutely enjoy books at higher levels. \n\n- Listening to a story and comprehending the plot, character dev, setting, etc. is absolutely a literacy skill. For example, Blind children listen to audiobooks all the time when Braille isn\u2019t available and yes, they still are reading. \n\n- if the issue is that your daughter isn\u2019t reading her own library books then my advice is to return the ones that don\u2019t interest her and check out others. The library will not be offended that she didn\u2019t read them. Forcing her to finish books she\u2019s not interested in will only foster anxiety about reading. Your wife is unintentionally creating a negative association with books. Not good! \n\n- anecdotally, I grew up with a family who all gathered round the couch to listen to their father read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings to them on Saturday nights, even in high school. All five of those children grew up to be avid readers!", "Omg. This is one of the biggest pet peeves of library workers! Your daughter won\u2019t love reading if she is forced. We evolved as oral story tellers. Listening to someone read, whether it\u2019s another person or an audiobook, is very natural. It teaches her to love stories. Once she is more confident or gets impatient waiting for you, she will start reading on her own. There is a chance she won\u2019t, one of my kids hates reading (breaks my heart), but some of that is personality. You can\u2019t force her to want it. You can make her hate it by forcing her.\n\nIf your wife wants to have her do assigned reading everyday, fine. It should be an age-appropriate amount and it shouldn\u2019t be tied to your reading. If she wants to make it dependent on something, tie it to screen time. No tv or video games until she\u2019s done her reading. Something like that. Again, it should be an age-appropriate amount of reading and it should be something your daughter is interested in. Your wife will probably hate this, but graphic novels count as reading. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t curtail your reading with her. That\u2019s probably the worst thing you could do. It\u2019s a special time between the two of you and it teaches her that books are amazing, not a chore. You\u2019re also introducing her to more advanced vocabulary, sentence structure, and themes than she will find in books at her age level. \n\nYour wife can ask pretty much any library worker or teacher and I\u2019d be shocked if they said you should stop reading to her. We complain all the time about parents being rigid with what and how their kids read. NTA", "NTA.

Here's his web page as well:\n\nhttps://www.trelease-on-reading.com/\n\nHe is a long time proponent of reading aloud to kids....even, or especially, when they can read at some level by themselves. There are lots of reasons, but one that I particularly remember (but am probably explaining badly....its been a while) is that a student's reading vocabulary doesn't catch up with their listening vocabulary until they are in high school or college.\n\nMy favorite story of his that illustrates the awesome power of reading aloud is from an article in the February 1995 issue of Smithsonian Magazine, where he talks about a little girl born with Downs syndrome (called trisomy 21 now) who was read 10 books every day from birth. At the time of the article, she was a 4th grader, mainstreamed in a regular classroom, and had a better vocabulary than some of her 'normal' classmates.\n\nTo paraphrase Mr. Trelease, if reading to your kids was a kit you had to order from a warehouse for three easy payments of $49.99, they wouldn't be able to keep it on the shelves. If kids hated it, it would be in every classroom in America.

I loved reading on my own, but my pronunciation of words is atrocious because I rarely got read to, so I never heard very words before even though I\u2019d seen them.", "Why does she have to read alone first? If you both enjoy bonding over sharing the series you love, why can\u2019t your daughter sometimes spend time reading her books to you? Reading out loud is a critical skill and it\u2019s still bonding time if you\u2019re reading together. You can encourage her to read more of her book when you\u2019re working evenings, then listen to her recount the story on another day. Reading encouraged, problem solved.", "You really do need to encourage your daughter to read at home too, if she hasn't cracked a book outside school in months. Have her read a chapter to you from her book, then read her one from yours. Perfect bonding time, and some reading practise.\n\nAlso, Harry Potter gets pretty dark in a few books time, at least by 8 year old standards!", "Could you alternate with the reading? Some nights she reads to you and other nights you read to her.", "Why not alternate? One night, you read to her and the next, she reads to you. That way you still get to spend the time with her but she's encouraged to read as well and develop her reading skills with you.", "Honestly, all I have to say to your wife is \"ok...and?\" Library books aren't required reading, your daughter isn't going to get punished for not reading them. The important thing is that she is partaking in literature, surely? It doesn't matter if she's reading it herself, or being read to, the end result is still the same, your daughter is broadening her mind and imagination, and having a love of books. \n\nMy 3yo has a Yoto, it reads him stories when I'm tapped out, so he's still getting his stories, and I don't have to read the Gruffalo for the 18th time in an evening. I personally believe as long as the stories are getting into her brain, how they get there shouldn't matter \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAnd unless the school has raised concerns about her reading ability, it shouldn't matter to your wife either.

My mom was my reader when I was little, and I don't see why your kid can't learn to enjoy listening to a story (which might be objectively harder to focus on and follow) as well as solo reading time.\n\nMaybe there is a bigger issue with your wife......have u tried reading to her? Maybe a \"hey, I didn't get this part, what do you think?\" Or a \"daughter loved this part, let me read it to you!\". But idk if she would be receptive. Best of luck", "Perhaps you and your daughter could take it in turns? You can still have your bonding time with her that way. NTA", "I second this! Now is the perfect time to start the Circle of Magic books!", "What if you switch off, and sometimes she reads to you? Then you still get the lovely bonding moments that are so important. \n\nThat's what my mom and I used to do, we had a lot of long car trips and we'd always have a \"car book\" that I would read aloud on drives. It's still a really great memory for me.", "Why dont you and your daughter take turns reading Harry Potter aloud to eachother? There are ways to get her to read and be engaged without sacrificing bonding time. You could even assign certain characters to yourself and to your daughter- or you could read the narration and she could read the dialog! There are lots of fun ways to share reading.", "Unfortunately you\u2019re doing that thing where you feel bad you aren\u2019t always there so you say yes to being \u201cfun dad\u201d around this topic.

Take turns so your daughter reads one night and then you read the following day.", "Info: Do you live close to any bookstores? Libraries kinda have a set time frame on when you have to bring books back, but storebought books or thrifted books are yours to keep.", "Perhaps your wife would be more comfortable if you made it a habit of encouraging solo reading as well. This doesn't have to be overbearing, it can be as simple as letting your daughter know if she loves Harry Potter there's LOTS of other stories about magical worlds and people she'd also love, maybe even love more that HP, *she just needs to find them!* \n\nYou could also start asking her to read a paragraph or two to YOU before you read her to sleep. Stuff like that.", "This.\n\nSoft YTA. Reading HP clearly is not the problem.

We also did a lot of books on tape for long car rides. The Cat Who series was our jam by 10.\n\nThankfully when HP was coming out, we were the similar ages for each book. Negative was we had to wait for the movie to come out to learn how to say Hermione. That was rough. I have a lot of great memories reading books with my mom and investing in a book as a family. Keep it up.", "They do get pretty scary after book 3 and probably a bit much for an 8 year old. Maybe try Aru Shah and the End of Time (5 books in that series) or Amari and the Night Brothers (2 books so far).  The Unforgettable Logan Foster (2 books so far) Wings of Fire (15 books) Keeper of Lost Cities (9 I think) and The Wild Robot (3) are also fantastic. \n\nHonestly middle-grade (Gr3-7) is probably my favorite genre. The stories and characters are well developed but the topics aren\u2019t too heavy. I still read to my 11 year old every night and I very time he gets a free moment his nose is in a book. Reading to your kid won\u2019t stop her from reading on her own. NTA", "They do get a lot darker, but some kids can handle that. It's up to you what you think is best. If you're looking for more fantasy books that are for around that age group, I cannot recommend Tamora Pierce highly enough. Her Circle of Magic series is still my go-to comfort series. She has plenty of strong young women in her novels, and they are all wonderful stories.", "absolutely agreed on all these points. ESH. not to mention Harry Potter has its own issues within and without of the series, so unless the HP books were also borrowed and not bought, there\u2019s a discussion between the parents to be had about putting money in the pocket of a known bigot who is using her platform to fund and promote hateful legislation.", "He said she IS reading on her own. Maybe check reading compression before you throw stones.", "This. My mom read them to me and then when I could we would switch off reading. As they cane out I would read it all by myself, usually overnight haha, then she would read it and then we\u2019d read it aloud together", "Plus good memories :) my memories of moments like these with my dad and mom are many times what keep me from falling apart as a stressed out adult tbh.", "My dad did too. We started reading my dad's original copies of the hobbit and lord of the rings when I was 8. Fostered my love of reading heavily.", "That's adorable", "Same. Reading with my dad at night is what got me interested in reading! We did a mix of books he picked (Harry Potter, LOTR) and books from my school library (Inkheart, Inkspell, etc.), so maybe OP could try and do the same thing to encourage his daughter to read some of her library books even when they aren\u2019t doing it together. \n\nAnd for what it\u2019s worth, I was one of the top readers in my grade for the entirety of elementary and middle school, and I\u2019m currently working on a PhD in English. So OP, just know that my dad reading to me directly led to the path I\u2019m on.", "I was the exact same way in elementary to a point where I was tested at a college level when I was in 4th grade. My teachers made a choice to skip me a grade in English cause I was too far ahead of my peers and I was causing a bit of a problem by going too far ahead and having nothing to do, so I was matched with an older student who had dyslexia. He\u2019d help me stay on topic and in focus (ADHD), and all he\u2019d have to do is nudge me in the side and point out a word for me to sound out. He was also one of the \u201cproblem students\u201d but he and I worked well together cause we just did our own thing and helped each other here and there, he\u2019d also keep me from being bullied which was a plus. No one would pick on the tiny bookworm if the big tall broody kid was there. \n\nMy teachers would also allow me to stay in during recesses and would just leave me in the classroom during their own breaks, and if just stay in a corner with a fat book. They also wouldn\u2019t mind when I\u2019d bring books from home cause I never did disturb anyone and would only pull it out during quiet times.", "I h a t e d reading plans, Lord of the Flies? I barely managed it\u2026 Yet I read through Goosebumps books in a day.", "Yes! He is sharing a book series he loves with her\u2026 it would be amazing for her to be encouraged to find a book/ book series she loves so she can also share with *him*.", "I agree with this. It is important your daughter reads and this is a good compromise to make with her. Also, maybe switch books before you get too far in Harry Potter.", "This is what we are going to do.  We are going to alternate back and forth, a good compromise.  Thanks everyone!", "I did this with my mom because she could only access so many books i  braille. We\u2019d trade off where I read her one of my books, she\u2019d read to me, or we both listened to an audio book. But I didn\u2019t enjoy reading so much until I hit 4th grade and found a book that called to me. Otherwise, I preferred being read to. Now, I have to read because I can\u2019t pay attention to audio books.", "I agree, Harry Potter is an excellent series for learning to read. It starts very easy and increases in language complexity over time while at the same time being interesting and quite long for a children\u2019s series. Try switching off after each page so you read to each other. It\u2019s a tough situation because it can be hard to motivate children to read until you find a book they like. A lot of school books kind of suck (Catcher in the Rye anyone?) and as a consequence children don\u2019t read them.", "Actually, being read to increases vocabulary and increases interest in reading in general.\n\nUnless the child is behind in reading, which OP says they\u2019re not, being read to is purely beneficial. There is literally no negative impact of being read to. \n\nBUT I would recommend getting 2 copies of the book (my local library has many copies of HP1-7) or reading aloud while the kid can follow along while visibly seeing the words. This will improve her reading skills.", "OP says she finished an 11 chapter book, how is unknown. OP would not be here if his kid was on grade level.", "My parents had LotR on tape. I have never traditionally read LotR, but I\u2019ve listened to it a bajillion times! I drive an hour to get anywhere and LotR is at least a once a year tradition.", "There was one series we read, I think it was Garth Nix The Seventh Tower series, that one book ended on an extreme cliffhanger.

It can and should be both things! I do read alouds with my kids (12, 9) still. They also read on their own. We have series we love together and we all have different tastes too. I don\u2019t read their books about dragons and they don\u2019t read Bront\u00eb novels. Send her to read on her own 15 minutes before you join her for your together reading. Or, let your wife be read to by your daughter and you continue your story together after. Either way is fantastic. Reading, in any capacity, is extremely valuable. Consider the vocabulary she wouldn\u2019t be exposed to at her level for reading, but will understand higher level vocab because of what you read to her. Lastly, and definitely most importantly, the idea is to instill a LOVE of reading. If you want a child to love books show them that you love books. Books are magical if you\u2019re listening to them or reading them. You\u2019re doing a fantastic job!\n\nNTA", "OP, Please do NOT stop reading to your daughter. I can share some personal experience with you and your wife.\n\n1. Reading to your daughter still exposes her to vocabulary, language, grammar, concepts, life experiences, points of view, tone etc.\n2. If your child is both being read to and reading independently, her reading skills are absolutely not being stunted.\n3. My youngest was reading college level when she was in middle school and is now a freshman in high school. Her dad and I and she all still love sharing books that we read aloud. We've been doing this since she was in elementary. In the past 4-5 years, we have read a plethora of old (my era) and current childrens'/youth fiction, modern literary classics (e,g., Of Mice and Men and Fahrenheit 451), classic science fiction (Asimov), current authors like Christina Baker Kline and Fannie Flagg, and some very profound graphic novels (ie., a wide variety of reading levels and styles). We discuss the messages, the writing style, what we like or don't like. We relate some of the topics to current events. Every bit of it builds a child's reading skills.\n4. And just important, that time of bonding and sharing and loving something together is priceless. Your reading time with your daughter is her 'soft' place - where she can enjoy being herself and enjoy being with you and shut the rest of the world out.\n5. Although you may do the majority of reading aloud, I do suggest you have your daughter take some turns at reading aloud. It will also help with her reading fluency. But you don't have to make it a requirement or chore; just a simple trading off to give you a break sometimes or because she just wants to.\n6. No one has to end your reading time with your daughter. As long as she puts in some time reading for herself as well as enjoying her reading time with you, she is doing plenty.\n7. If your wife insists on turning reading into a chore and kills this special time you have with your daughter, she is doing exactly what she should be doing IF she wants to make your daughter HATE reading and put less effort into it. AND she'll be costing your family the benefits of this wonderful bonding time you have. Oh, before she crams her bad idea down the family's throat, she might want to check with the experts. I bet if your wife asked a librarian or a reading specialist, she might be surprised to find they fully support you continuing to share reading with your daughter.", "YTA\n\nDaughter should be reading to you not you to her.", "NTA for wanting to read to your daughter. Soft YTA for reading Harry Potter to your daughter even after all of JK Rowling\u2019s bullshit :)", "NTA. What you're doing is encouraging your daughter to develop a love for reading, and obviously bonding with her at the same time. What your wife is doing, on the other hand, is encouraging your daughter to see reading as a chore. Should your daughter spend more time on her library books? Sure. But making reading into something stressful is not going to make her want to read more. Maybe you could get her to read to you, or read along with you and do the voices of the characters.", "NTA, and I think HP is a great series to read together", "NTA. And you could have her spend a few minutes practicing reading with you, then reading to her as the reward. What you're doing is building both her skills and your relationship to her.

If anything, it teaches them to associate books with positive feelings.", "NTA, Good memories #1, like 10-20 years later she will be like ''oh I remember when my dad would read X, Y, Z to me'', and #2 if anything that's IMPROVING her love of books or reading skills.", "Some of my favorite memories as a kid are of my parents reading to me or telling me stories. Don\u2019t stop. Maybe your daughter can read to you sometimes as well? NTA.", "Elementary Teacher here.  You are doing just fine.  She can read her library books at school.  Reading to your child is not only a parent/child bonding time, but it teaches the children to read with feeling.  It also teaches them proper reading speed and a host of other important skills.

She's doing a great job of making sure your daughter hates reading.\n\nMy dad read the first four Harry Potter books to me when I was in 4th grade, right around your daughter's age. My father also took me to the midnight releases at  Barnes and Noble for the rest of the series. These are some of my core/favorite memories with my dad.\n\nIt fostered my love of reading, and made me an avid reader as a child.\n\nI'm 31 now and still enjoy being read to. I couldn't wait for him to read my childhood books to my daughter, I got to hear all of the voices again!\n\nOh, and my mom read the Narnia series, The Phantom Tollbooth, and The Thief of Always to me, among many others. Again, core memories.", "NTA I think you're right, reading to her is great for many reasons. As a mom, I feel a tremendous amount of pressure to make sure my kids are smart, well behaved, social, safe, independent, strong, capable, etc etc. Your wife is stressing because that's what moms do and that's what we are pushed to do. Perhaps you can come up with a compromise where you and your daughter take turns reading to each other so that your daughter is getting practice reading and you still get to bond.", "I have never heard of a\u201d dependent reader \u201c.\nI\u2019m appalled at your wife but feel sad at the same time. My daughter loved when her dad read Barbie Comic books to her at night. I could hear them laughing thru the whole house. It seems my husband tried acting out how he\u2019d walk in Barbie shoes!!

Dad worked long hours and we didn\u2019t get to spend much time with him during the week, and those hours were really special. We\u2019re both voracious readers, both majored in English at college, I became a journalist and my brother is a lawyer. You\u2019re doing a wonderful thing with your daughter, who is probably just excited for more of a series which is notably addicting. I think it\u2019s hard for adults to remember how it feels for a little kid to get so absorbed in books the way they do, but it\u2019s a wonderful thing. Tell your wife that when you finish Harry Potter you\u2019ll ask her to pick up the next book and you\u2019ll take turns reading. NTA of course. And maybe invite her to come in and sit with you! I think my mom was glad to have the time alone downstairs while my dad hung out with us, but I know she got jealous sometimes of all the giggling coming from a room she wasn\u2019t in.", "NTA, but if she needs practice, what about having HER read to YOU?  Still NTA if you chose to keep reading to her, but maybe her reading to you would be a good compromise.  You would still get the bonding time.", "Nta and your wife needs to back off or your daughter will dislike reading. My mom read to me until I was 10. I also read but not too much on my own until then. Then I started reading more and more and by age 12, I was reading 1 book per week. Enjoy!", "NTA I WISH either one of my parents read with me. At least my mom was supportive by getting me the series I liked.\n\nAuditory reading is reading too, it actually HELPS listening comprehension, which a lot of kids struggle with.\n\nI know I could be way off base here but i have a theory. From what you've said your wife's behavior comes off as kind of jealous of your special time with your daughter. I would encourage you to dig into that a little.  It may come from her feeling left out, not that if excuses her horrible behavior. But you both might be able to come up with a solution with another activity all of you enjoy together.  \n\nAgain could be completely wrong and it's something else entirely but I encourage you to talk to her so resentment doesn't build on either side.\n\nGood luck OP", "Omg I would do just about anything to score a guy like you. You have every right to read with your daughter. Your wife sounds oddly uptight, maybe she hates the occasional whining? Being read to is very important for kids. They pick up on vocabulary while using their imagination. It's peaceful and intelligent. \n\nI would suggest having your daughter read a few small parts and work your way up to taking turns. That is how I engaged my 9 year old daughter to read something other than Plants vs. Zombies graphic novel. She doesn't like chapter books but indulges me when we read together. \nEven without that, you're NTA. It's lovely bonding time and she will remember it forever. Harry Potter is eternal, and so will her love of you reading to her. \nMom needs to be careful that she isn't hurting your child's self confidence and esteem by yapping about her displeasure. It's a ridiculous hill to die on. Too many kids never pick up a book. Yours does.", "Your wife is wrong about how kids learn to read and what motivates them. Reading out loud helps reading development and there\u2019s no evidence it does harm.\n\nNTA", "Illiterate kids need and deserve intervention. I've known enough delusional parents that this is YTA for me. I've known dyslexic kids to hide it well past 8 yo.

But if your co-parent says something is wrong, listen.", "NTA. As a third grade teacher, this is music to my ears. Kids this age still love to be read to. I read aloud to my students daily. They adore it. Plus, you are helping to build your daughter\u2019s vocabulary by exposing her to literature that she would not be able to read on her own. That will be beneficial to her in the future. \n\nI can maybe offer up a bit of a compromise however. Kids this age generally like to be \u201cthe teacher\u201d. Why not have your daughter read aloud to you from a book that is at her current reading level? Encourage her to share a book that she\u2019s picked out the same way you\u2019re sharing books you enjoy with her. A chapter in her book and then a chapter of Harry Potter (or part of a chapter, I know how long Harry Potter chapters can be when you\u2019re reading them aloud). This might be a way that you can continue your bonding time (which I love) while also building her independent reading skills.\n\nI will also say that I think you\u2019re wife needs to change her approach. A parent demanding a child read has never engendered a love of reading. Maybe she needs to find her own book to start sharing with your daughter? \n\nAlso, there is nothing wrong with being \u201caverage\u201d in a subject of school. Kids have natural strengths and weaknesses. As long as your daughters not struggling or significantly below the grade level expectations, I wouldn\u2019t worry. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s growing as a reader, especially with a great dad at home to foster a love of reading with her.", "She will get a lot of learning from you reading to her, it's important! We read together, I can pronounce the longer words so later they will recognise them when they come across them. Sometimes I explain words or concepts we come across. I add accents and expression and actions to the words so the book is fun, just like if it was a movie. We laugh at different bits of the book and I sneak in little changes to the words to make it silly and it's a great experience. Sometimes it's not every night, and Dad is doing the reading or putting to bed then that's fine. We will read next night.\n\nLater when they read on their own, this is how they will do it for themselves, and later for their kids. Also, just because you read doesn't mean that your child can't read their own book too. The two activities are interrelated, not exclusive!", "NTA, what a beautiful way to bond with your daughter, I don\u2019t understand why your wife would want to discourage that?
