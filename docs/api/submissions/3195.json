{"id": 3195, "submission_id": "z4b7yn", "title": "AITA for not gifting my nephew as nice a gift as his cousins because his parents are poor?", "selftext": "Obligatory throw away \n\nEvery Christmas my husband (C) and I get gifts for all the kids in the family. C is a stay at home dad with no income. We are financially comfortable, not rich, because I am a college graduate. C and his family are minority immigrants who mostly work labor jobs. \n      This year while holiday shopping there were six kids total we needed to buy for. The gift we bought for D(19) was above $100. We spend the most on him because we got custody of him at 15 and raised him. D will also buy gifts for C, our child, and I, around $40 each.\n        Their is a sibling group of kids J(10), A(6), M(2) who i bought gifts for. The gifts are all around $30-$35 each. Their parents are both hardworking and always buy our daughter gifts for Christmas. There is an only child U(6) who we spent $45 on because his parents buy us gifts as well and we will be buying his parents around $50 each. \n   This brings us to L(12). L and his family immigrated here to the U.S. a few months ago. L does not have an easy life as he doesn\u2019t speak English and shares 1 bedroom with both his parents. L\u2019s mom does not work so his dad works overtime but they are hardly making it.  \n   While shopping I picked out a really cheap, $15 Lego set for L. I did not want to get him nothing because that seems cruel. I  know his parents do not have money to give  gifts back so I didn\u2019t plan to spend more. \n   My husband wanted to add another few gifts to L\u2019s gift so that we\u2019re spending around the same amount on each kid. I told him I would rather not because L\u2019s parents can\u2019t reciprocate it. \n     My husband tells me we can afford more and L has already had a \u201ctough year.\u201d He says the extra $30 for a better gift would just be wasted on fast food. He says L would see his cousins gifts and know that they\u2019re better gifts.\n       I told my husband that L\u2019s mom should get a job and give him a nice Christmas then like J,A, and M\u2019s family. I also reminded him how I will be paying for and cooking food for the Christmas party everyone will be attending and L and his family probably won\u2019t bring anything because they can not afford to.\n     C looked hurt, as if I was insinuating L did not deserve a nice Christmas because his parents are poor. Every kid deserves a nice Christmas, I just do not think it\u2019s necessary to spend as much as the people who will actually be giving us gifts. \n   C tells me I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be a poor immigrant and have people treat you the way I\u2019m treating L. C was not angry but looked hurt. I know C was brought to the U.S.  as a child too and had a had a similar life to L. \n    For the sake of peace I bought the extra gifts for L, so total around $35 for him. C still won\u2019t talk to me and i can\u2019t understand why. I spent the extra money, and obviously don\u2019t expect anything else in return. Aita?\n\n\nUpdate/ More context:  \n\n\nFirstly, I do agree that maybe i was TA and that you all are right and Christmas time is about giving not receiving. \n\nAlso, since L\u2019s parents have arrived to the U.S. I have been financially helping them (the whole family is). I\u2019ve given them money for groceries and other miscellaneous things. They are undocumented so they don\u2019t qualify for any assistance. I have also taken L out to eat and brought takeout to their house and had lunch with them a few times.\n\n\nL is 12-13 not 10. \n\nEvery year before L and his family arrived we (JAM and U parents)  have discussed how much we will spend on each other. The gift exchange is for those wanting to participate. We usually set around a $50 limit per person. So I was staying within that limit like i do every year and just wasn\u2019t sure what to do about L and his family. I do not think they will be gift exchanging with the 3 other family\u2019s ( Mine, U, and JAM\u2019s) since they can not afford to. \n\n  I will talk to the other families to see what the plan is for L and his family. I was buying the $15 gift so he doesn\u2019t feel left out. Since it\u2019s a family \u201cgift exchange\u201d I\u2019m not sure how much they\u2019ll spend on L since his parents won\u2019t be exchanging. The other families will probably buy L a gift though because family is important to their culture.\n\n\nAlso as pointed out maybe, yes, i am frustrated that L\u2019s mother does not work. L is old enough to stay home for a few hours if both parents were at work. My husband does not work and U\u2019s mother doesn\u2019t work because my job pays well and U\u2019s father owns a business. I feel frustrated for L that he lives the way he lives but yet only one parent is working. Yes L\u2019s parents are undocumented, as was asked, but we live in a metropolis where she wouldn\u2019t have a problem getting a job. If L\u2019s mother was to work then we could include her family in the gift exchange and this fight wouldn\u2019t have happened to begin with. Yes it sounds elitist to \u201cjust work\u201d but life is isn\u2019t easy and plenty of Americans wake up and go to work even when they don\u2019t feel like it every day.", "created_utc": 1669376010, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4b7yn/aita_for_not_gifting_my_nephew_as_nice_a_gift_as/", "score": 2186, "replies": ["#[Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). \r\n\r\nPlease review our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq) if you're unsure what that means.", "YTA.

Shit, I'm broke now, but if I had it? I'd be spending my money to give kids like L the Christmas they deserve because all kids like toys! All kids need stimulation!! and to know that he's definitely going without while the other kids have what they need is heartbreaking.\n\nYour husband isn't talking to you because he was hoping you'd show empathy and compassion for a kid struggling during the holiday season.

That kid probably deserves even more than the other kids to have a lovely Christmas. You think way too much about money to actually enjoy gift giving and the joy that comes with it.

Because yes, you were insinuating a kid didn't deserve equal treatment to other kids because his parents are poor.\n\nGiving gifts is about generosity, not reciprocity.", "YTA it\u2019s funny I knew exactly where this was heading when you started talking about getting gifts back.

This is a small child who you have admitted has not had an easy life. I think your husband is shocked by your lack of compassion and generosity.

IF you\u2019re going to divide things unfairly based on the parents\u2019 income, maybe you should consider giving him MORE since his parents can\u2019t afford a nicer Christmas.

Buying gifts based on who will also buy you a gift? That\u2019s gross and completely not even in the spirit of Christmas.
