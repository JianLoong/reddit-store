Your stepmom deserves to have happiness in her life, and I think you can feel pleased that you were part of that journey in bringing her together with someone new. It sounds like your Dad\u2019s side of the family haven\u2019t come to terms with their grief, and feel that Jason is their connection to your dad. I\u2019m sure they will come round in time.", "I think you probably know this, but NTA. And your extended family is nuts if they think they have any grounds to take Jason away from his mother.", "NTA I'm sure this is big news for your family to take in, but it's absurd for them to be taking it out on you", "NTA. However, I'm wondering if it is very hard for Jason and that he is venting to his dad's family. Of course, at 8 year's old, he doesnt have much say on where his mom decides to move.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s all serendipity. \n\nYour father\u2019s side of the family can plan a visit instead of being nasty and therefore risk alienating Kelly and Jason.", "NTA\n\nYour stepmom is free to live wherever she chooses with her minor child.", "NTA, how in the world could you have known all of this would take place? How about they offer to fly and see Jason? Or bring Jason back once in a while? You did a good thing and should be proud that you are so supportive", "What an incredibly heartwarming story! NTA obviously. Your father's side of the family sucks but they'll hopefully get over it.", "Your stepmom is definitely an AH for uprooting Jason's life like that.

NTA.", "How wonderful that you had a part to play in your step mother finding new love after the loss of your father, that's so special.\n\nAll that matters is that two kind women have found love with each other, and that Jason and you can see them happy together.\n\nI'm sure Jason would rather have a happy mum , rather than see her be lonely.\n\nUnfortunately, a common trope amongst homophobic people is the idea that some gay people are predatory, especially if someone has previously been perceived as heterosexual - bigots often choose to \"forget\" that bisexuality and pansexuality exist.\n\nNo one has to explain or defend their sexuality to others, and it's disgusting that members of your family are using a beautiful moment as an excuse to be homophobic/biphobic/pan phobic just because they're upset that things are changing.\n\nI would have more empathy for your relatives if they weren't being so hateful. It can be upsetting when you can't see loved ones as much as you would like, I know I would love to see my neices more - *but* people have their own lives to live, and their own priorities.\n\nBy choosing to be so cruel, your family members are choosing to be removed from your lives. They have control over their own mouths and choices, no one is controlling them.\n\nYou are clearly very kind and empathetic, and a credit to your parents and Kelly. You can see her happiness, and you support her. Honestly, you've shown real maturity here, much more than much older people who should know better.\n\nI'm sorry these people have shown themselves to be so unpleasant, it must be a nasty shock. Please try to remember that their words and actions are about *them* and *their* thoughts and feelings, and are nothing to do with you.\n\nYou're a great person, Kelly, Trish and Jason are blessed to have you in their lives.\n\nNTA."]}
