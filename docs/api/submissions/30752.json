{"id": 30752, "submission_id": "17ss3mq", "title": "AITA for refusing to sign the papers so my wife can stay in the country?", "selftext": "My wife and I have been married since almost three years. Two years and 9 months to be exact.\n\nThe marriage didn't work out. I mentioned countless times the many things that didn't work between us, which were usually met with a complete lack of communication and just a mere \"I don't care\" or \"It's annoying / bothersome. / Why do I have to put in effort?\". So eventually I just hard cut it one day and told her I want a divorce and that I'm going to live separately from her from now on.\n\nHas been so since.\n\nNow the thing is, she's a foreigner, I'm a native, and the law states, that she could've gotten her own permit to stay if our marriage had lasted 3 years. But it was only 2 years and 9 months. And yes, even though we are not divorced, the actual time we lived together counts. The fact we live separately now means \"we were in a marital relationship for 2 years and 9 months\". This time is what counts. I got this confirmed by several lawyers.\n\nSo she can't apply for her own permit, but still needs to apply for one as \"my wife\". She needs a signature from me for that. This signature implies that I still love her and we're living together and we're not living separately and we're not thinking about divorce. This is obviously not true. I asked lawyers again about this, and got the confirmation, that \\*if\\* I signed this, I might incriminate myself for giving herself the leeway to garner a permit under false pretenses.\n\nLong story short, she can't get a permit.\n\nNow her lawyer and she herself accuse me of being heartless and that I just want her out of the country and hate her and just want to ruin her. Which is not true, I couldn't care less if she stayed, I just don't want to incriminate myself. Her lawyer and her suggest I just sign it because I could just \"pretend\" that we've made up or something and then she'd get her permit. She took a really long time to finally apply for a permit though, so if I did that the time where I can finally divorce her would move back by 14 months!\n\nI agree that this law is stupid, where it basically states \"if you and your spouse aren't getting along and you haven't been here 3 years yet, you have to leave the country.\" I mean, yeah, it sucks, but I don't think I should have to lie about such things and take the blame for it? I've been assured by lawyers that anything else would incriminate myself, and I have valid reasons for wanting to divorce that woman. She doesn't agree with the divorce, which causes it to only be possible after three years. It's been 14 months now as I said, so I'd have to just wait 22 more months. Signing her thing would set it back to 36 months again, and I don't want that, as, as I said, I have valid reasons for wanting to divorce, and I don't think I should take the blame for doing what lawyers tell me is the only legal thing to do.", "created_utc": 1699700086, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ss3mq/aita_for_refusing_to_sign_the_papers_so_my_wife/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

First, ignore the immigration lawyer since their job is to advocate for their client, your soon-to-be ex-wife, so of course a lawyer is going to say what it takes to get you to do what your client wants.

We aren't living in different residences, but that's not a problem.

Speak to your lawyer about this to make sure you do it properly because if this lawyer is willing to be unethical with your wife's case then I wouldn't be surprised if she has done thus on other cases and should not be allowed to practice. \n\nThe proof should also go to whoever is in charge of visas/citizenship in your country as it is proof that your ex is willing to not follow the rules to get what she wants, aka has disregard for your country's laws and legislation and believes herself above them (she is willing to break them to get what she wants).\n\nI would also ask your lawyer to send them a letter stating that any and all communication with you has to go through them (your lawyer), that should give you some space. Make it clear to your lawyer that the only correspondence you will entertain is your ex signing the divorce papers and nothing else.\n\nOh, and NTA.
