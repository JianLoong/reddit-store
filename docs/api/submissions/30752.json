Two years and 9 months to be exact.\n\nThe marriage didn't work out. I mentioned countless times the many things that didn't work between us, which were usually met with a complete lack of communication and just a mere \"I don't care\" or \"It's annoying / bothersome. / Why do I have to put in effort?\". So eventually I just hard cut it one day and told her I want a divorce and that I'm going to live separately from her from now on.\n\nHas been so since.\n\nNow the thing is, she's a foreigner, I'm a native, and the law states, that she could've gotten her own permit to stay if our marriage had lasted 3 years. But it was only 2 years and 9 months. And yes, even though we are not divorced, the actual time we lived together counts. The fact we live separately now means \"we were in a marital relationship for 2 years and 9 months\". This time is what counts. I got this confirmed by several lawyers.\n\nSo she can't apply for her own permit, but still needs to apply for one as \"my wife\". She needs a signature from me for that. This signature implies that I still love her and we're living together and we're not living separately and we're not thinking about divorce. This is obviously not true. I asked lawyers again about this, and got the confirmation, that \\*if\\* I signed this, I might incriminate myself for giving herself the leeway to garner a permit under false pretenses.\n\nLong story short, she can't get a permit.\n\nNow her lawyer and she herself accuse me of being heartless and that I just want her out of the country and hate her and just want to ruin her. Which is not true, I couldn't care less if she stayed, I just don't want to incriminate myself. Her lawyer and her suggest I just sign it because I could just \"pretend\" that we've made up or something and then she'd get her permit. She took a really long time to finally apply for a permit though, so if I did that the time where I can finally divorce her would move back by 14 months!\n\nI agree that this law is stupid, where it basically states \"if you and your spouse aren't getting along and you haven't been here 3 years yet, you have to leave the country.\" I mean, yeah, it sucks, but I don't think I should have to lie about such things and take the blame for it? I've been assured by lawyers that anything else would incriminate myself, and I have valid reasons for wanting to divorce that woman. She doesn't agree with the divorce, which causes it to only be possible after three years. It's been 14 months now as I said, so I'd have to just wait 22 more months. Signing her thing would set it back to 36 months again, and I don't want that, as, as I said, I have valid reasons for wanting to divorce, and I don't think I should take the blame for doing what lawyers tell me is the only legal thing to do.", "created_utc": 1699700086, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ss3mq/aita_for_refusing_to_sign_the_papers_so_my_wife/", "score": 1259, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

First, ignore the immigration lawyer since their job is to advocate for their client, your soon-to-be ex-wife, so of course a lawyer is going to say what it takes to get you to do what your client wants.

We aren't living in different residences, but that's not a problem. Over here you can live in the same place and still consider it \"living separately\" if the residence allows for it, which it definitely does.\n\nI can prove this through several ways, such as confirming to the financial institute that I am supposed as single, and through bank transactions to my wife that \\*magically\\* stopped the exact month I'm stating as me separating from her, and most perfectly, by the letter from her own lawyer stating that she has applied for separation money, which literally means that she agrees we are living separately.", "Pro tip:  If you want the lawyer to back off, threaten to send his emails where he's telling you to lie to the disciplinary board.", "It\u2019s time for you to move on.", "Sounds like her lawyer failed her badly (and helped you) by putting that in writing.

Make it clear to your lawyer that the only correspondence you will entertain is your ex signing the divorce papers and nothing else.\n\nOh, and NTA.

Don't listen to her, and never listen to a lawyer who asks you to lie (or do anything illegal).  Listen to YOUR lawyers who are advising you properly.\n\nSecond, it sounds like she was just using you as a conduit into the country.
