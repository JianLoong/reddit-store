Not sure why, it\u2019s just happened that I\u2019ve never had a long term relationship. Sometimes it sucks but for the most part I\u2019m pretty content in my spinsterhood, and have lots of hobbies/activities that keep me busy (to the point that my coupled/parent friends often say they wish they could try things like I do).\n\n\nRecently one of my close friend groups has been throwing around the idea of going on a group overseas holiday. I am already on the fence about this as I have my own plans for trips in the next year or two, but I am hanging around the group chat just in case it turns into something I want to do (at the moment it\u2019s just a lot of speculation). \n\n\nThe group currently consists of 5 couples, myself, and one other single person, Laura (36f). Laura got divorced 2 years ago and has had trouble adjusting to single life. Whenever we catch-up she mentions how lonely she is, especially on kid free weekends, how she hates being the odd-wheel, hates dating, etc. This is all stuff I\u2019ve had to deal with so I\u2019m sympathetic, but when I suggest going out and doing things for herself she just says she doesn\u2019t want to do things on her own.\n\n\nRecently in the chat the topic of hotels came up someone suggested, to save money, that Laura and I share a room. Laura immediately jumped on that idea so I said \u201cactually I\u2019d rather not\u201d.  When asked why I said that I prefer not to share rooms, which is true. I have my own routine and at this stage of my life I\u2019m not used to sharing space with people. (I know this will have to change if I ever get an intimate partner, but I don\u2019t think I have to for a travel buddy). Laura started talking about the  \u201csingle tax\u201d and how it\u2019s unfair she should have to pay full price. I said I\u2019m well aware of the single tax  as I have been travelling solo for many years. When others in the group also started chiming in that I should share I asked if they were so concerned, perhaps one of the couples would be willing to do a double queen room. No one volunteered, obviously. I was told by one of the guys that it\u2019s different because they want privacy, to which I said that I do too. I said if cost was an issue I was happy to stay in budget hotels to reduce price. Someone then said to just take one for the team. I told Laura that she should get used to this as a single person, having your needs disregarded to make things easier, said that I was out of the trip, then left the chat.\n\n\nMy best friend in the group (who to be fair did try and advocate for me) says I was  right but could have dealt with it better, while another friend is saying I\u2019ve put a dampener on the whole trip, and that Laura probably won\u2019t be able to come.

If they\u2019d just dropped it when you said said no, I would say NAH, but trying to guilt you into something you don\u2019t want to do is not cool.", "NTA.  You have a routine.  My friend and I used to share a room, but the last two times, she said she wanted her own. So we found a less expensive hotel and got our own rooms. Yeah, more expensive than one room, bit it's nice to have your own space. No worries about snoring or who wants it pitch black or who wants to watch TV until midnight.  Your choice is good.", "NTA. You are under no obligation to share a room with anyone. And those people who were badgering you about it were being AHs.   \nI recently went on a trip with my 3 sisters. There were 4 of us, and putting 2 to a room seemed logical. But you know what? I like my privacy. I told them I was getting my own room and they could figure out their own sleeping arrangements. We all have good jobs, so money wasn't an issue.  \nSo I got my room, and the 3 of them shared. Maybe they complained about me. LOL. I don't care. I'm an adult and didn't want a roommate.\n\nYou do you.", "NTA, even the very blunt, tactless **truth** at the end. It's unpleasant, but it is a reality, and one Laura will have to face, and *the couples needed to be reminded* is a true fact. \n\nYou don't want to share your space. That is completely your prerogative. And you have to pay extra to not share your space with someone who isn't your life-partner.\n\nYou don't have to \"take one for the team.\" It's not a \"team\" if you're the one always taking *that one*.", "Fun fact!  After the age of 26 spinsters become THORNBACKS!  Which is, IMO, a much cooler name.  \n\n\n\nNTA.  From one fellow thornback to another (and a fellow solo traveler) you are 100% within your right to not want to share a room.  If Laura doesn\u2019t want to pay for a room alone then she can find another roommate or skip the trip.", "NTA. Your friends needed to stay out of this.

Once you said no, I think maybe the others needed to just shush and not try to force you to cave in. Nobody should have volunteered you to do anything.

While your comment was aimed at everyone, in this situation the context can easily be interpreted as Laura is the problem. Also, if you have a problem with how your couple friends treat you and divide costs, you should speak up each time it happens and not use this situation as the time to blow up about all your past grievances. Having said that, your friends are definitely AHs. I'd be pissed if my friends disregarded my decision for their own convenience. You did good standing up for yourself.

There tends to be a pattern of me making way/bending for the needs of everyone else because I\u2019m single. Being asked to move/swap seats so they can sit together, even though I was there first. When chipping in for things like presents it\u2019s not divided up between 11 people, it\u2019s divided into 6 (5 couples plus me). I end up playing taxi because \u201cI\u2019m driving anyway, and that way they can both drink\u201d. And Laura used to do it to. I guess I pick my battles about it all and this time I was annoyed enough to stand up to it.", "I think what OP said WAS necessary, and I don't see how it's particularly cruel.

Now in a fabulous relationship & we\u2019re old enough to have the space for separate bedrooms (his kids left home before I moved in full time) - so I don\u2019t have to share toooo much space :-)", "Nta. Thats why I never go on trips with the office. Always want to have me share a room even when I say I'll pay for my own. Nah routine, space and privacy are important. Single or not", "NTA Why do people always expect single persons to share rooms? I am single too and I hate sharing rooms. I want my privacy just as much as couples want that.", "ESH. You didnt really want to go on the trip anyways, so the whole debate about sharing a room was pointless. They could have decided to stay at a cheaper hotel, if they wanted to accommodate Laura.", "NTA", "NTA. Pointing out that they have to prepare to see me naked usually puts people off \ud83d\ude06. Whilst I do have a partner, yeah, it's no sharing for me outside of that as I need my space and don't wear bedclothes. \n\nWhilst it would be a 'neat' solution, if you're uncomfortable it's a no go. Decent friends would realise this instead of pressuring one person to be unhappy for the sake of another.", "NTA.  I'm married and totally get it.  You made the right choice", "Nta sounds like they wanted you along to make it easier for Laura. That's not your job.", "And they\u2019re saying that they all get the holiday they want, because they\u2019re couples.  \nBut OP should just \u201esuck it up\u201c and \u201etake one for the team.\u201c Yep, those are the vibes you really look for in a vacation.", "I would hate this.  Now someone potentially has to share a bed or they all get single rooms (more expensive) because your desire for privacy outweighed the group.", "NTA. It\u2019s sounds like Laura needs a babysitter or minder. Just because I\u2019m single doesn\u2019t mean I want to deal with the odd man out. Also, I haven\u2019t had nor wanted a roommate since college, and didn\u2019t want one then.", "OP, I feel your pain! NTA.\n\nI was a single adult for 18 years. Have been part of a couple/family since then (20+ years), but I haven't forgotten the good, the bad, and the ugly of being single.\n\n1. No, you did not have to deal with it \"better\". You were polite and honest about your boundaries. You did not impose on others or try to stomp over their boundaries. You were not rude when others did stomp over your boundaries. There should have been nothing for you to even have to deal with.\n2. No, YOU did not put a damper on the whole trip. Laura being a needy whiner put a damper on things. Her flying monkeys who feel it is their place to tell you what you should/shouldn't sacrifice for Laura's sake... and kept insisting on imposing on you put a damper on things.\n3. You didn't force ONE thing on anyone else. You even offered two other options, which no one was willing to accept because it required them to give up something for Laura's sake.  When they kept insisting on imposing on you, you opted out.\n4. What should have happened: (Laura should not have asked her friend to \"suggest\" you two share. - Come on; don't you think the 'suggestion' originated with her?). If Laura proposed sharing - directly to you, in private and you declined; then that should have been the end of the discussion.\n5. If Laura wants to go with the group, she needs to learn to go - without requiring you or anyone else to sacrifice to stop her whining. Her champions need to learn to either make the sacrifice themselves and stop feeling entitled to dismiss your boundaries.\n6. Personally, I would text the group a link to this post. Let them read for themselves and get a clue how THEY ruined this trip for you and themselves.", "\\-. Someone then said to just take one for the team.\n\nI love this, I'm single at 50 and still get sh$& like this, like at no point do couples or family get that after a certain age and a certain income, if you all don't like the way I (and /or other singles) feel comfortable traveling....then we will just go a little harder on the shingle travel.... and you all can take one for the team then!!!!", "NTA\n\n  I think what you said was \"dealing with it better.\"     Specifically your last comment about having your needs disregarded as a single person because that is exactly what they were doing.  If they felt the mood dampen, it's because they didn't want to be called out on it.", "Nta. You have shitty friends.", "NTA\n\nJust because you\u2019re single doesn\u2019t mean you have to be paired with any other available single person. \n\nIt\u2019s fine to have personal preferences and to rather have a room just for you instead of sharing one. \n\nIt can be fun to share as did some of my friends when vacationing together but it\u2019s a personal choice not a community decision. \n\nEnjoy your vacations. I think you did the right thing advocating for yourself and leaving the group chat.", "NTA. Single tax\u2026 what a goof.

The others are hypocrites. You have your own routines and you gave a right to have them respected.", "NTA, you should ask your friends why they need privacy. And why they think you and Linda won\u2019t need it for the same reasons?", "NTA, you already said once you didn\u2019t want to share rooms, other people pressed you and it ended up being blunt because you had no choice but to stand your ground.", "I think they\u2019re trying to set you up to date Laura, pair the spares sort of thing", "\u201cI told Laura that she should get used to this as a single person, having your needs disregarded to make things easier, said that I was out of the trip, then left the chat.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s brilliant. Probably wasted, unfortunately, but brilliant.", "NTA. Sharing rooms as an adult with someone you aren't comfortable with sucks.", "NTA. \n\nYou were cornered, you stood up for yourself.  Standing up for yourself does not make you an asshole.  The fact that you're willing to pay more and the others aren't doesn't make you an asshole.\n\nPerhaps you could have massaged the issue better, who knows, that isn't totally clear from your post.  But single people are people too, and some people really do need to have a place to go where it's just them (or just \"their clan\").  I know I do.  I don't blame folks for thinking it was a good idea, and I don't blame you for standing up for yourself.", "Why don't each of the other couples kick in an extra 12.5% and give it to Laura? Then she could afford to go. No big deal.\n\nNTA", "Absolutely this - how is it that her desire for her own room is \u2018less important\u2019 just because she is single? I\u2019m sick of this crap - the \u2018tax\u2019 is not just financial - it\u2019s emotional too - single folks aren\u2019t second class citizens.", "They\u2019d be stuck in the same boat if OP opted out because her privacy needs weren\u2019t going to be met.
