Not sure why, it\u2019s just happened that I\u2019ve never had a long term relationship. Sometimes it sucks but for the most part I\u2019m pretty content in my spinsterhood, and have lots of hobbies/activities that keep me busy (to the point that my coupled/parent friends often say they wish they could try things like I do).\n\n\nRecently one of my close friend groups has been throwing around the idea of going on a group overseas holiday. I am already on the fence about this as I have my own plans for trips in the next year or two, but I am hanging around the group chat just in case it turns into something I want to do (at the moment it\u2019s just a lot of speculation). \n\n\nThe group currently consists of 5 couples, myself, and one other single person, Laura (36f). Laura got divorced 2 years ago and has had trouble adjusting to single life. Whenever we catch-up she mentions how lonely she is, especially on kid free weekends, how she hates being the odd-wheel, hates dating, etc. This is all stuff I\u2019ve had to deal with so I\u2019m sympathetic, but when I suggest going out and doing things for herself she just says she doesn\u2019t want to do things on her own.\n\n\nRecently in the chat the topic of hotels came up someone suggested, to save money, that Laura and I share a room. Laura immediately jumped on that idea so I said \u201cactually I\u2019d rather not\u201d.  When asked why I said that I prefer not to share rooms, which is true. I have my own routine and at this stage of my life I\u2019m not used to sharing space with people. (I know this will have to change if I ever get an intimate partner, but I don\u2019t think I have to for a travel buddy). Laura started talking about the  \u201csingle tax\u201d and how it\u2019s unfair she should have to pay full price. I said I\u2019m well aware of the single tax  as I have been travelling solo for many years. When others in the group also started chiming in that I should share I asked if they were so concerned, perhaps one of the couples would be willing to do a double queen room. No one volunteered, obviously. I was told by one of the guys that it\u2019s different because they want privacy, to which I said that I do too. I said if cost was an issue I was happy to stay in budget hotels to reduce price. Someone then said to just take one for the team. I told Laura that she should get used to this as a single person, having your needs disregarded to make things easier, said that I was out of the trip, then left the chat.\n\n\nMy best friend in the group (who to be fair did try and advocate for me) says I was  right but could have dealt with it better, while another friend is saying I\u2019ve put a dampener on the whole trip, and that Laura probably won\u2019t be able to come.

If they want to complain, they should STFU and open their room to her. Since they choose not to, they have no business saying anything to you about it. \n\nBacking out of the trip was smart. I wouldn't have wanted to travel with a pack of hypocrites.", "NTA and not worth the aggravation. If you want your own room and your friends can\u2019t respect that, that\u2019s their issue.", "Nope, NTA. You don't have to give up your personal space and privacy to make others happy.", "NTA. If they\u2019d just dropped it when you said said no, I would say NAH, but trying to guilt you into something you don\u2019t want to do is not cool.", "NTA.  You have a routine.  My friend and I used to share a room, but the last two tines, she said she wanted her own. So we found a less expensive hotel and got our own rooms. Yeah, more expensive than one room, bit it's nice to have your own space. No worries about snoring or who wants it pitch black or who wants to watch TV until midnight.  Your choice is good.", "NTA. You are under no obligation to share a room with anyone. And those people who were badgering you about it were being AHs.   \nI recently went on a trip with my 3 sisters. There were 4 of us, and putting 2 to a room seemed logical. But you know what? I like my privacy. I told them I was getting my own room and they could figure out their own sleeping arrangements. We all have good jobs, so money wasn't an issue.  \nSo I got my room, and the 3 of them shared. Maybe they complained about me. LOL. I don't care. I'm an adult and didn't want a roommate.\n\nYou do you.", "NTA, even the very blunt, tactless **truth** at the end. It's unpleasant, but it is a reality, and one Laura will have to face, and *the couples needed to be reminded* is a true fact. \n\nYou don't want to share your space. That is completely your prerogative. And you have to pay extra to not share your space with someone who isn't your life-partner.\n\nYou don't have to \"take one for the team.\" It's not a \"team\" if you're the one always taking *that one*.", "Fun fact!  After the age of 26 spinsters become THORNBACKS!  Which is, IMO, a much cooler name.  \n\n\n\nNTA.  From one fellow thornback to another (and a fellow solo traveler) you are 100% within your right to not want to share a room.  If Laura doesn\u2019t want to pay for a room alone then she can find another roommate or skip the trip.", "NTA. Your friends needed to stay out of this. As a single person, I too have experienced second rate treatment on group trips. You are entitled to your comfort and privacy as much as anyone else on the trip is, especially as you are willing to pay for it", "Solo traveller here. Well used to the single tax. The only time I'd ever share a room is if it's a hostel and I have no other choice but to stay in said hostel.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. As one who pays the single tax frequently.  I\u2019ve come to find its worth it.", "NTA.", "NTA - I get that Laura feels lonely but her participation in the trip should depend on yours. And if you don\u2019t want to share a room, you shouldn\u2019t have to.", "NTA.  Not even close.", "NTA\n\nWell handled.  And they don't like the truth and won't put their money where their mouth is (share with Laura).", "NTA.  Once you said no, I think maybe the others needed to just shush and not try to force you to cave in. Nobody should have volunteered you to do anything. As the suggested idea was more of a done deal in everybody head pretty much. And how dare you not accept it. Laura whining over the single tax not being fair after you said no, that annoyed me for you.", "NTA. Why would you take one for the team during a vacation, a time that is supposed to be for enjoyment. Nonsense", "NTA for standing your ground but an AH for \"that she should get used to this as a single person, having your needs disregarded to make things easier\". While your comment was aimed at everyone, in this situation the context can easily be interpreted as Laura is the problem. Also, if you have a problem with how your couple friends treat you and divide costs, you should speak up each time it happens and not use this situation as the time to blow up about all your past grievances. Having said that, your friends are definitely AHs. I'd be pissed if my friends disregarded my decision for their own convenience. You did good standing up for yourself.

There tends to be a pattern of me making way/bending for the needs of everyone else because I\u2019m single. Being asked to move/swap seats so they can sit together, even though I was there first. When chipping in for things like presents it\u2019s not divided up between 11 people, it\u2019s divided into 6 (5 couples plus me). I end up playing taxi because \u201cI\u2019m driving anyway, and that way they can both drink\u201d. And Laura used to do it to. I guess I pick my battles about it all and this time I was annoyed enough to stand up to it.", "I think what OP said WAS necessary, and I don't see how it's particularly cruel. Laura IS single, and single people DO often have their needs overlooked in favour of couples/families and she DOES have to get used to it instead of whining and trying guilt a friend into compromising her comfort."]}
