{"id": 4887, "submission_id": "znkhq3", "title": "UPDATE: AITA for yelling at my mom that I hate Harry Potter and to LET ME LIVE MY OWN LIFE", "selftext": "Here's my original posting: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rku5j5/aita\\_for\\_yelling\\_at\\_my\\_mom\\_that\\_i\\_hate\\_harry/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rku5j5/aita_for_yelling_at_my_mom_that_i_hate_harry/)\n\nHi so I ended up moving in with Missy\u2019s family for a few months because it was all too much. It was really nice, but I ended up moving back out because I did miss my family if you can believe it.\n\nMissy\u2019s Mom helped me figure out how to talk to my Mom and Dad and we sat down to air out everything. It really seemed like they were finally ready to let me be my own person and back off and also that thing about the family making memories that DON\u2019T have to do with fandom. They said all those things were so important to them they wanted to share them.\n\nFor my birthday they took us all to Arches like I always wanted. On the road trip there we listened to a fantasy young adult book that they all wanted to hear. I didn\u2019t want to but they were doing a nice thing for me so I didn\u2019t complain. It wasn\u2019t bad, but I still don\u2019t like fantasy. But lots of you told me to just try with an open mind and when you're driving through the desert you kind of have to.\n\nWhen we got to Arches I felt really emotional like when you have a really good day and you\u2019re waiting for the sun to set and everything to get dark again because that\u2019s what feels comfortable. But then I ate so much pizza my face smelled like cheese and I felt a little better.\n\nOn the ride home when it was just me and Dad awake said he was happy I had come home and he hopes we can all get along better now and that I don\u2019t feel so much anger towards them.\n\nBut as time went on things all went back and that\u2019s just how my family is. It\u2019s what my siblings are happy with and what my mom and dad like. And it\u2019s not my place to tell them not to be who they are.\n\nSo I ended up making a big decision and the reason that I wanted to pick now to write this update is that I am going to college in Colorado. I received my early acceptance a few days ago and I feel like I can breathe again. Not just that but I will be starting a new life with a new first name. One my mom helped me choose that has nothing to do with any media at all.\n\nI will be able to branch out and be myself but I\u2019ll still be a car ride away from my nerdy parents for when I miss mom\u2019s hugs and dad\u2019s meatball subs.\n\nAnd that\u2019s all I really wanted \ud83d\ude42", "created_utc": 1671212754, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/znkhq3/update_aita_for_yelling_at_my_mom_that_i_hate/", "score": 8068, "replies": ["i\u2019m proud of you OP, i hope you have fun in college exploring your own interests with your new name as well :)", "I am a huge fan of Harry Potter and Star Wars\u2026.

I have a 1 year old daughter and I want to make sure I don't fall into the same habits your parents did. Because as a sign of affection I do like to share my interests with people, I do want to show her things that made me happy when I was young and I hope they make her happy too! But I'm determined that if she doesn't like something I do, no harm no foul she doesn't have to hear about it again. And if she likes something I don't know anything about, I will do everything I can to learn about it and support her. She's still a baby, so my wife and I still pick all of her clothes (some are nerdy, many are just cute) but I am very excited for her to grow up and find her own style and interests. So thank you for sharing, it really helped inspire me to be a better parent!", "Good for you, finding your voice and being your own person. I know everyone is different and entitled to like what they like, but Fandoms have really gotten out of hand in a lot of ways.

I love the idea that as parents we will always be at least a little bit out of touch, no matter what we do to stay cool or relevant.

You may be more of a hands-on learner who needs to DO  things, to move your hands and body, and to get outside. \n\nSometimes people who don\u2019t learn as much by passively listening or watching also don\u2019t enjoy movies and tv. That is valid. You might also not be as much of an uncritical consumer, and that\u2019s valid too. (I think people who embrace the nerd label don\u2019t think of their fandom as conspicuous consumption, but it sure can be.) \n\nI also have issues with *some* genre fiction, depending on the writer. It can be pretty predictable with too much minutiae. Fans don\u2019t like to hear that though. Some students I have had can only get interested in nonfiction, and that\u2019s a thing.  \n\nGood luck to you as you plan your adult life.", "So nice you got to stand to yourself. I hope you find your tribe and live your own life.\n\nBest regards", "If it helps my parents shared their interests with me, but in a very mild way.

I don't ever want her to feel obligated to like something or think that it would make me happy if she pretended to like Star Wars or something.

(they mentioned their birthday, so it's probably right on the borderline) they would still be just about to turn 18 when they go to college in the fall. Which is perfectly normal to do? Or am I missing something here?", "> I\u2019ve had my own insurance since like 14\n\nno you didn't lmao, you had insurance that your parents took out for you. A minor cannot sign a legally binding agreement, I don't know why this is so hard for you to understand.", "So much attitude. I started college, moved out of my parents house, and signed an apartment lease at 17. It\u2019s definitely possible.", "Who pissed in your coffee this morning? Sheesh. \n\nI went to college in a different state at 17 because of when my birthday is. My parents signed forms allowing me to live in a dorm. Parental authorization is a thing, and clearly OP's parents are on her side because her mom helped her choose a new name, which is something you'd need parental authorization for before 18. \n\nCalm down.

Sharing our likes and passions with our children or others is one thing, **FORCING** them on others is quite something else(and in your case got to abusive levels). I know you're not into fantasy but your situation made me think of a Chinese cultivation webnovel where the MC was basically from our world but was given a McGuffin pendent that swapped him into a parallel universe where everyone cultivated spirit energy. Everything was just about the same, friends, circumstances, whatnot, but there were some major differences. Since everyone had magical powers science fiction, literature and science were treated as crazy or useless things. Instead of comic books the MC's lazy friend would geek out over (hard)science and math texts and the whole high school class would complain about not getting to do enough literature lessons and how wonderful the world would be if they had more than 1 hour of literature or math every week. (Versatile Mage)\n\nIf they start to slide more, a good explanation your parents might get is that they are no different than sports parents who force their kids to be competitive in sports until they hate them.

I do not push my reading preferences on them became I come from a family of sci-fi and fantasy enthusiasts and I really don't \"get\" sci-fi. I've read plenty of it. And I don't hate it. I'm just not a connoisseur like lots of my siblings are. (And I loved me some Harry Potter. But, I get it if my kids could give a rip.)\n\nSo, I am happy for you. The space in your head is indoctrinated and acclimated to your parents' preferences. But, now you get to explore and develop your own. Good on you.

It just wasn't cool.", "It really does suck. I wasn't a big reader as a kid which always upset my mom, it was Harry Potter that finally got me into reading. I didn't obsess over it like super fans. I did buy all the books back then and kept them. When I was pregnant I kind of got excited about one day reading them to my own kid and reminiscing about how they affected me and got me into reading, but now looking at them is a lot of mixed feelings.\n\nEven though they were all bought ages ago it seems off to me to possibly get my kid interested in a fandom I now don't want to further financially support.", "Describing centaurs like Native Americans who are rapey savages. \n\nDescribing goblins as an inferior race who \"irrationally\" want to have rights.", "Cho, surprisingly, isn't the only Asian character. There's the twins, Parvati and Padma Patil, and Nagini. You may remember Nagini as Voldemort's giant snake, but Rowling \"reveals\" in Fantastic Beasts that the big snake is actually a Korean woman (in sexy, tight clothing) who Voldemort just keeps as his literal pet. So yeah.... there's that.\n\nIn total there's roughly a dozen people of color in all of Harry Potter, despite how *massive* the cast of characters is. Across all 8 films, actors who are poc only make up 1% of all spoken dialogue. The most prominent Black character is named Kingsley *Shacklebolt.* (No points for guessing what word association she was using when naming him).\n\nThen we have Seamus Finnigan, who is always causing explosions. For unaware Americans, this is a prime example of British anti-Irish sentiment. Great Britain did the same colonialism they did everywhere else in Ireland, too, and committed genocide against the Irish. When the IRA fought back in their (unfortunately failed) attempts at independence, they did many bombings across the UK. Meaning that Rowling stereotyped her singular Irish character as a terrorist caricature.\n\nAnd, of course, there's all of the shit with the house elves. The elves are a slave race who *love* being slaves. They quite explicitly don't know how to function when not being kept as slaves (Winky falls into depression and alcoholism after being freed). Dobby is the only exception, and is said to have something wrong with him for actually wanting freedom (then he just chooses to go back to slave work anyway). Hermione (who Rowling said could be Black) is made into a laughingstock by the characters and the narrative itself for having the stupid, silly, high-minded idea of thinking slavery is bad. Harry himself thinks Hermione is too annoying and doesn't want to hear her talking about slavery abolition. He goes on to get his own personal slave, Kreacher.\n\nRowling uses the Harry Potter series to mount her argument of \"slavery is good, actually\" and takes the actual, real world justifications that were made for the Transatlantic Slave Trade to defend it. Same as the goblins are her stand in Jewish people, the house elves are her stand in for Black people.\n\nThere's even more nonsense \"expanding the lore\" on her official Wizarding World website when she details other wizard schools. A bunch of racist, made up names for the schools (which make zero sense with the languages used). \n\nJust look at the fucking map and start counting the problems: [https://twitter.com/terriblemaps/status/1234558864575602688](https://twitter.com/terriblemaps/status/1234558864575602688)\n\nSpecial mention to her saying all the Native Peoples across North America got their culture and spiritually from her fictional magic.", "Yep that went over my head.", "She's named after a resin.", "Mine too.", "Unexpected Pratchett. :D", "I get it my cousin has the same name except hers has an added \u201credneck\u201d twist for a middle name.

Never been to Utah, but I love far west Texas, hanging out in the Mexican/Texan border area. \n\nOne last thing that I never really learned... 3 hrs of study for every 1 hr of class. THat is, if you do 10 hrs of class work, that means 30 hrs of study. THat's right, sucess comes at a price.", "I sometimes wonder about your post and what happened to you, and am so happy you came back and updated us. Glad things are getting better for you.", "Now I have a question. I\u2019m planning to be an archaeologist and I love history. If I had kids, would history be the same as a fandom? I see parents taking their kids to historical places all the time, and I feel like it\u2019s much more broad. I\u2019d be just as happy traveling to a medieval castle as I would to an ancient Hindu temple. But then again, part of it is media. I like playing Tomb Raider and Uncharted, assassin\u2019s creed, watching history documentaries, etc. So would my interests in history be the same as the Harry Potter fandom?", "We\u2019re a buncha big nerds too and I remember seeing this post and having the \u201coh shi- I don\u2019t wanna mess up my kid\u201d thing. I like most things fantasy and anime, I made a living off the industry and making a business off it now so it\u2019s still deep rooted. I\u2019ll toss on some silly anime show for her now and again, she\u2019s 3, but if she isn\u2019t interested I\u2019m not going to keep it on. I wouldn\u2019t be sad if she never liked the things I liked, I just want to see her grow and thrive.", "And Elsa predates Frozen (and is a much less annoying name than Hermione), yet even that is a bit tainted", "No her name is probably Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way", "One of my classmates had what was usually a completely normal Arab name, but took on a different connotation when we went to high school at the height of the War on Terror: Osama Husain.", "Ah, sadly I don\u2019t really play anymore (Pok\u00e9mon Go took over and I suck at playing two exploratory games at once; learned that when the HP one came out and well. All things considered, at least I didn\u2019t get too attached to that one. <<). I was very much a Smurf tho and I still carry my fan made challenge coin with me everywhere I take my power bank with. :D", "I just wish Ursula wasn't tainted. The name means \"strength of bears.\" Bears are strong animals that immediately give off the idea of protection and love (mama bears at least) and I pick names based on meaning not just how they sound. But no, i can't  name my daughter that if i were to have one because people will think I'm naming her after a Disney character. A villian at that.", "Oh the fun of having to spell your name everytime to people when you set up appointments. I love that my mom tried to be unique cursing me to spell my name for everyone even though it's closer to the original spelling /s. My name comes from mythology and everyone in the US spells it one way but the place of origin spells it another, mine is a mix of the spellings plus a misspelling. Also everyone pronounces my name wrong even if i verbally introduce myself.", "Sadly, it isn't the weirdest name he has mentioned.  They gave a nickname to one kid because no one could pronounce his actual name.", "I wanted to call my daughter Amara. My family (my mum) bullied me out of it.\n\nMy mum tried to force me to call her Tanith because she loved that name. I pretty much hated it (nothing against the name Tanith, I think I just hated it because my mum picked it and was trying to force it on me)\n\nMy daughter ended up being Abby. She's an adult now and her favourite name is 'Amara'.", "It seems more antisemitic to me that some people automatically associate big beaks and bankers with Jewish people. \n\nWho looks at those goblins from Harry Potter and thinks: \"Yeah, they are clearly supposed to represent Jews.\"? \n\nThey're just goblins.", "I don't really see what the issue is with that map you posted?", "Our store was robbed by a guy with his birth year 1995 tattooed on his face. You can imagine how easy it was for the police to find him.", "My dad and I have completely different tastes in literature, so the only material we have in common and sort of bonded over was Karl Marx\u2019s work because we both read it in college \ud83d\ude02", "Seamus didn't blow shit up in the books though. That was something from the films.", "I'm happy for you, OP. Not gonna lie, I grew up reading Harry Potter and loving fantasy, and even I cringed hard at your parents... Life is more than fandom... I hope they eventually learn that they don't need to be absorbed by the things they like", "I know I\u2019m not your mom, but I am a mom. And I\u2019m really, really proud of you. I hope you\u2019re able to find the space to explore what you love.", "Thank you for a truly wholesome ending. You are going to be alright in this world. I'm excited for you and all the new adventures you'll have.", "Wow! You are an inspiration. So proud of you!", "Good for you!!\n\nAlso, When you do get a legal name change, will you tell us the one your parents picked out for you?", "I\u2019m so happy for this update.

Best of luck to you! \ud83d\udc9c", "I remember reading your original post, I\u2019m so glad things got better for you! I love that you got a new non-fandom name and it\u2019s so sweet your mom could help, I bet it meant a lot to her. I hope you have a great time in college.", "I named my daughter after a character from the Dragon Riders of Pern. But, she loves her name, and she\u2019s never even read one or had one foisted on her lol. And she likes some nerd things with me. Then again, I didn\u2019t cram any of this stuff down her throat.", "please no", "\"Don't annoy me unless you wanna get Diznee in your face!\" (Like.. this knee)", "Good gracious", "First search result:\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2022/01/05/the-harry-potter-anti-semitism-controversy-explained/?sh=4152ec096776", "I love the name Amara.

The people pointing this out know that antisemitic people have historically associated these characteristics with Jews. She might as well have called one of them Shylock ffs, it's not subtle.", "Yeah if the goblins theyre talking about then its a huge reach and i want to be faaar away from these people. Super antisemitic to see a big nose and assume Jewish", "https://xkcd.com/327/", "So like Pete Davidson and Jon Stewart? Who both drew the comparison. The reason it\u2019s so obvious to Jewish people is because they were an incredibly obvious caricature of Jewish people from history. It\u2019s great that you don\u2019t think hook nosed greedy cabal of secret bankers, but much of the world has for millennia.\n\nEdit- you\u2019re totally right, she\u2019s racist against black people and Asian people and transphobic but it\u2019s soooo unlikely she doesn\u2019t like Jewish people", "[deleted]", "Umm I said not all Jews. Great reading comprehension. \nAlso- yeah. It was totally antisemitic. I was like 9 when I read it and I saw it. I\u2019m glad you have some kind of attachment to her books but she\u2019s kind of awful. Cho Chang? Really? There is nothing in the books to make me give her the benefit of the doubt. And seriously - making goblins with big noses be the bankers IS the problem. She could have used ANYTHING else and it wouldn\u2019t have drawn the same conclusion."]}
