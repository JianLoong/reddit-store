{"id": 4887, "submission_id": "znkhq3", "title": "UPDATE: AITA for yelling at my mom that I hate Harry Potter and to LET ME LIVE MY OWN LIFE", "selftext": "Here's my original posting: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rku5j5/aita\\_for\\_yelling\\_at\\_my\\_mom\\_that\\_i\\_hate\\_harry/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rku5j5/aita_for_yelling_at_my_mom_that_i_hate_harry/)\n\nHi so I ended up moving in with Missy\u2019s family for a few months because it was all too much. It was really nice, but I ended up moving back out because I did miss my family if you can believe it.\n\nMissy\u2019s Mom helped me figure out how to talk to my Mom and Dad and we sat down to air out everything. It really seemed like they were finally ready to let me be my own person and back off and also that thing about the family making memories that DON\u2019T have to do with fandom. They said all those things were so important to them they wanted to share them.\n\nFor my birthday they took us all to Arches like I always wanted. On the road trip there we listened to a fantasy young adult book that they all wanted to hear. I didn\u2019t want to but they were doing a nice thing for me so I didn\u2019t complain. It wasn\u2019t bad, but I still don\u2019t like fantasy. But lots of you told me to just try with an open mind and when you're driving through the desert you kind of have to.\n\nWhen we got to Arches I felt really emotional like when you have a really good day and you\u2019re waiting for the sun to set and everything to get dark again because that\u2019s what feels comfortable. But then I ate so much pizza my face smelled like cheese and I felt a little better.\n\nOn the ride home when it was just me and Dad awake said he was happy I had come home and he hopes we can all get along better now and that I don\u2019t feel so much anger towards them.\n\nBut as time went on things all went back and that\u2019s just how my family is. It\u2019s what my siblings are happy with and what my mom and dad like. And it\u2019s not my place to tell them not to be who they are.\n\nSo I ended up making a big decision and the reason that I wanted to pick now to write this update is that I am going to college in Colorado. I received my early acceptance a few days ago and I feel like I can breathe again. Not just that but I will be starting a new life with a new first name. One my mom helped me choose that has nothing to do with any media at all.\n\nI will be able to branch out and be myself but I\u2019ll still be a car ride away from my nerdy parents for when I miss mom\u2019s hugs and dad\u2019s meatball subs.\n\nAnd that\u2019s all I really wanted \ud83d\ude42", "created_utc": 1671212754, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/znkhq3/update_aita_for_yelling_at_my_mom_that_i_hate/", "score": 2056, "replies": ["i\u2019m proud of you OP, i hope you have fun in college exploring your own interests with your new name as well :)", "I am a huge fan of Harry Potter and Star Wars\u2026.

I have a 1 year old daughter and I want to make sure I don't fall into the same habits your parents did. Because as a sign of affection I do like to share my interests with people, I do want to show her things that made me happy when I was young and I hope they make her happy too! But I'm determined that if she doesn't like something I do, no harm no foul she doesn't have to hear about it again. And if she likes something I don't know anything about, I will do everything I can to learn about it and support her. She's still a baby, so my wife and I still pick all of her clothes (some are nerdy, many are just cute) but I am very excited for her to grow up and find her own style and interests. So thank you for sharing, it really helped inspire me to be a better parent!", "Good for you, finding your voice and being your own person. I know everyone is different and entitled to like what they like, but Fandoms have really gotten out of hand in a lot of ways.

I love the idea that as parents we will always be at least a little bit out of touch, no matter what we do to stay cool or relevant. They assume you are rebellious, but you may have a very different learning style from your parents. You may be more of a hands-on learner who needs to DO  things, to move your hands and body, and to get outside. \n\nSometimes people who don\u2019t learn as much by passively listening or watching don\u2019t enjoy movies and tv. That is valid. You might also not be as much of an uncritical consumer, and that\u2019s valid too. (I think people who embrace the nerd label don\u2019t think of their fandom as conspicuous consumption, but it sure can be.) \n\nI also have issues with *some* genre fiction, depending on the writer. It can be pretty predictable with too much minutiae. Fans don\u2019t like to hear that though. Some students I have had can only get interested in nonfiction, and that\u2019s a thing.  \n\nGood luck to you as you plan your adult life.", "So nice you got to stand to yourself. I hope you find your tribe and live your own life.\n\nBest regards", "If it helps my parents shared their interests with me, but in a very mild way.

I don't ever want her to feel obligated to like something or think that it would make me happy if she pretended to like Star Wars or something.

(they mentioned their birthday, so it's probably right on the borderline) they would still be just about to turn 18 when they go to college in the fall. Which is perfectly normal to do? Or am I missing something here?", "> I\u2019ve had my own insurance since like 14\n\nno you didn't lmao, you had insurance that your parents took out for you. A minor cannot sign a legally binding agreement, I don't know why this is so hard for you to understand.", "So much attitude. I started college, moved out of my parents house, and signed an apartment lease at 17. It\u2019s definitely possible.", "Who pissed in your coffee this morning? Sheesh. \n\nI went to college in a different state at 17 because of when my birthday is. My parents signed forms allowing me to live in a dorm. Parental authorization is a thing, and clearly OP's parents are on her side because her mom helped her choose a new name, which is something you'd need parental authorization for before 18. \n\nCalm down.

Sharing our likes and passions with our children or others is one thing, **FORCING** them on others is quite something else(and in your case got to abusive levels). I know you're not into fantasy but your situation made me think of a Chinese cultivation webnovel where the MC was basically from our world but was given a McGuffin pendent that swapped him into a parallel universe where everyone cultivated spirit energy. Everything was just about the same, friends, circumstances, whatnot, but there were some major differences. Since everyone had magical powers science fiction, literature and science were treated as crazy or useless things. Instead of comic books the MC's lazy friend would geek out over (hard)science and math texts and the whole high school class would complain about not getting to do enough literature lessons and how wonderful the world would be if they had more than 1 hour of literature or math every week. (Versatile Mage)\n\nIf they start to slide more, a good explanation your parents might get is that they are no different than sports parents who force their kids to be competitive in sports until they hate them.

I do not push my reading preferences on them became I come from a family of sci-fi and fantasy enthusiasts and I really don't \"get\" sci-fi. I've read plenty of it. And I don't hate it. I'm just not a connoisseur like lots of my siblings are. (And I loved me some Harry Potter. But, I get it if my kids could give a rip.)\n\nSo, I am happy for you. The space in your head is indoctrinated and acclimated to your parents' preferences. But, now you get to explore and develop your own. Good on you.

Into sure she did it but it is fine because I agree with it.", "You don\u2019t need my response\u2014I don\u2019t have the wealth of time that Jamie has and MANY of her objectionable statements are directly quoted in the video. Watch it first and THEN talk to me if you want my opinions\n\nEdit: meaning, making this video is a part of his job so it is well researched and well explained. I\u2019m just trying to enjoy my day off so my interactions are more limited and will take up less effort", "So you had time to hear what someone said about the essay, but didn't have time to read the essay? Nah, you're lazy.", "I\u2019ve read the essay. I used to be a big Harry Potter fan. The essay makes me feel really upset and I don\u2019t feel like explaining it to you when there are other people who can do it better. Did you want to read the essay? Do you feel like giving a lukewarm defense on why \u201csex is real\u201d?", "[removed]"]}
