It was really nice, but I ended up moving back out because I did miss my family if you can believe it.\n\nMissy\u2019s Mom helped me figure out how to talk to my Mom and Dad and we sat down to air out everything. It really seemed like they were finally ready to let me be my own person and back off and also that thing about the family making memories that DON\u2019T have to do with fandom. They said all those things were so important to them they wanted to share them.\n\nFor my birthday they took us all to Arches like I always wanted. On the road trip there we listened to a fantasy young adult book that they all wanted to hear. I didn\u2019t want to but they were doing a nice thing for me so I didn\u2019t complain. It wasn\u2019t bad, but I still don\u2019t like fantasy. But lots of you told me to just try with an open mind and when you're driving through the desert you kind of have to.\n\nWhen we got to Arches I felt really emotional like when you have a really good day and you\u2019re waiting for the sun to set and everything to get dark again because that\u2019s what feels comfortable. But then I ate so much pizza my face smelled like cheese and I felt a little better.\n\nOn the ride home when it was just me and Dad awake said he was happy I had come home and he hopes we can all get along better now and that I don\u2019t feel so much anger towards them.\n\nBut as time went on things all went back and that\u2019s just how my family is. It\u2019s what my siblings are happy with and what my mom and dad like. And it\u2019s not my place to tell them not to be who they are.\n\nSo I ended up making a big decision and the reason that I wanted to pick now to write this update is that I am going to college in Colorado. I received my early acceptance a few days ago and I feel like I can breathe again. Not just that but I will be starting a new life with a new first name. One my mom helped me choose that has nothing to do with any media at all.\n\nI will be able to branch out and be myself but I\u2019ll still be a car ride away from my nerdy parents for when I miss mom\u2019s hugs and dad\u2019s meatball subs.\n\nAnd that\u2019s all I really wanted \ud83d\ude42", "created_utc": 1671212754, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/znkhq3/update_aita_for_yelling_at_my_mom_that_i_hate/", "score": 45, "replies": ["i\u2019m proud of you OP, i hope you have fun in college exploring your own interests with your new name as well :)", "I am a huge fan of Harry Potter and Star Wars\u2026. And Star Trek\u2026. Game of Thrones\u2026 etc. and I hear you and are glad that you were able to work it with your parents that you have different interests. As a dad I have to let my daughter be who SHE wants to be, not who I WANT her to be.\n\nAlso I would LOVE to go to arches!!!  nerds even\nLike to go outside sometime\u2026. Your parents are weird even by nerd standards\u2026.\ud83d\ude1c", "Good for you for fighting for own interests and identity.  Gotta say, though, it's more palatable to discuss Harry Potter and indoctrination in this context rather than, you know, the OTHER context... :(", "Congrats!!!", "This is poorly written fiction and I feel so sorry for all of you that believe a teen from Utah writes things like \"lightsabre\" and \"organised.\" Not to mention the fact that she's now claiming she will be going to Colorado as an unaccompanied 16 year old lmao. \n\nAll redditors that upvote this post, please contact me for a very lucrative and time-sensitive business opportunity involving the Brooklyn Bridge.", "I'm sorry that the changes seemed so temporary, at least you had a good memory with them before going off to college. Now you can forge ahead with your life and enjoy your own interests, good luck op!", "Sometimes one of the hardest lessons we all have to learn is that we have a better relationship with people we love with a bit of distance.\n\nI love that your mother helped you choose your new name. You all love each other *and* support each other. You\u2019ll all get there in the end.", "Wow, I'm so happy for you, OP! Not least of which that you got to go to Arches!!! I love Utah, wish I could spend more time there. Sorry your parents seem to have reverted back to their old selves but at least they are understanding you a little better now. Good luck in college!", "The original thread was a year ago, which means OP is now 17, and will be 18 when she graduates, which is perfectly normal. I\u2019m sorry math seems to be a struggle for you", "She was 15 a year ago. [OP says as much in this comment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rku5j5/aita_for_yelling_at_my_mom_that_i_hate_harry/hpcu3iv/?context=3)\n\n> I\u2019m sorry math seems to be a struggle for you\n\nThe delicious irony. I'm sorry critical thinking is such a struggle for you.", "I was 16 and took college course your point still doesn\u2019t stand buddy people can get into college at any age.", "I didn't turn 18 until the November of my first year in university. It happens.", "Based on how you write, I'm going to assume this was a community college course. And of course people can take college classes early. It's highly unlikely they would be able to move to a different state before they can legally sign a rent agreement, sign up for insurance, etc. Combined with the fact that OP commonly adds in and then edits out little anglicizations here and there makes me think this post is fake. \n\nI'm sorry that this is difficult for you to understand, but you definitely seem like a great potential business partner. PM me about that bridge.", "What are you even talking about no it wasn\u2019t community college second I\u2019ve had my own insurance since like 14 third her parents can definitely rent a property but even if she\u2019s not doing that dorms exist.", "Neither did I. What does that have to do with OP being 16 lmao? You also seem like a great potential business partner."]}
