{"id": 4887, "submission_id": "znkhq3", "title": "UPDATE: AITA for yelling at my mom that I hate Harry Potter and to LET ME LIVE MY OWN LIFE", "selftext": "Here's my original posting: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rku5j5/aita\\_for\\_yelling\\_at\\_my\\_mom\\_that\\_i\\_hate\\_harry/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rku5j5/aita_for_yelling_at_my_mom_that_i_hate_harry/)\n\nHi so I ended up moving in with Missy\u2019s family for a few months because it was all too much. It was really nice, but I ended up moving back out because I did miss my family if you can believe it.\n\nMissy\u2019s Mom helped me figure out how to talk to my Mom and Dad and we sat down to air out everything. It really seemed like they were finally ready to let me be my own person and back off and also that thing about the family making memories that DON\u2019T have to do with fandom. They said all those things were so important to them they wanted to share them.\n\nFor my birthday they took us all to Arches like I always wanted. On the road trip there we listened to a fantasy young adult book that they all wanted to hear. I didn\u2019t want to but they were doing a nice thing for me so I didn\u2019t complain. It wasn\u2019t bad, but I still don\u2019t like fantasy. But lots of you told me to just try with an open mind and when you're driving through the desert you kind of have to.\n\nWhen we got to Arches I felt really emotional like when you have a really good day and you\u2019re waiting for the sun to set and everything to get dark again because that\u2019s what feels comfortable. But then I ate so much pizza my face smelled like cheese and I felt a little better.\n\nOn the ride home when it was just me and Dad awake said he was happy I had come home and he hopes we can all get along better now and that I don\u2019t feel so much anger towards them.\n\nBut as time went on things all went back and that\u2019s just how my family is. It\u2019s what my siblings are happy with and what my mom and dad like. And it\u2019s not my place to tell them not to be who they are.\n\nSo I ended up making a big decision and the reason that I wanted to pick now to write this update is that I am going to college in Colorado. I received my early acceptance a few days ago and I feel like I can breathe again. Not just that but I will be starting a new life with a new first name. One my mom helped me choose that has nothing to do with any media at all.\n\nI will be able to branch out and be myself but I\u2019ll still be a car ride away from my nerdy parents for when I miss mom\u2019s hugs and dad\u2019s meatball subs.\n\nAnd that\u2019s all I really wanted \ud83d\ude42", "created_utc": 1671212754, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/znkhq3/update_aita_for_yelling_at_my_mom_that_i_hate/", "score": 640, "replies": ["i\u2019m proud of you OP, i hope you have fun in college exploring your own interests with your new name as well :)", "I am a huge fan of Harry Potter and Star Wars\u2026. And Star Trek\u2026. Game of Thrones\u2026 etc. and I hear you and are glad that you were able to work it with your parents that you have different interests. As a dad I have to let my daughter be who SHE wants to be, not who I WANT her to be.\n\nAlso I would LOVE to go to arches!!!  nerds even\nLike to go outside sometime\u2026. Your parents are weird even by nerd standards\u2026.\ud83d\ude1c", "Good for you for fighting for own interests and identity.  Gotta say, though, it's more palatable to discuss Harry Potter and indoctrination in this context rather than, you know, the OTHER context... :(", "Congrats!!!", "[removed]", "I'm sorry that the changes seemed so temporary, at least you had a good memory with them before going off to college. Now you can forge ahead with your life and enjoy your own interests, good luck op!", "Sometimes one of the hardest lessons we all have to learn is that we have a better relationship with people we love with a bit of distance.\n\nI love that your mother helped you choose your new name. You all love each other *and* support each other. You\u2019ll all get there in the end.", "Wow, I'm so happy for you, OP! Not least of which that you got to go to Arches!!! I love Utah, wish I could spend more time there. Sorry your parents seem to have reverted back to their old selves but at least they are understanding you a little better now. Good luck in college!", "The original thread was a year ago, which means OP is now 17, and will be 18 when she graduates, which is perfectly normal. I\u2019m sorry math seems to be a struggle for you", "[removed]", "I was 16 and took college course your point still doesn\u2019t stand buddy people can get into college at any age.", "I didn't turn 18 until the November of my first year in university. It happens.", "Based on how you write, I'm going to assume this was a community college course. And of course people can take college classes early. It's highly unlikely they would be able to move to a different state before they can legally sign a rent agreement, sign up for insurance, etc. Combined with the fact that OP commonly adds in and then edits out little anglicizations here and there makes me think this post is fake. \n\nI'm sorry that this is difficult for you to understand, but you definitely seem like a great potential business partner. PM me about that bridge.", "What are you even talking about no it wasn\u2019t community college second I\u2019ve had my own insurance since like 14 third her parents can definitely rent a property but even if she\u2019s not doing that dorms exist.", "Neither did I. What does that have to do with OP being 16 lmao? You also seem like a great potential business partner.", "Ah me cockles are warmed through. So pleased for you. \n\nThis post should be shared with anyone who AITA for wanting to name my child after *insert media character here*", "I'm so glad to see this update because I think about your initial post pretty often. I have a 1 year old daughter and I want to make sure I don't fall into the same habits your parents did. Because as a sign of affection I do like to share my interests with people, I do want to show her things that made me happy when I was young and I hope they make her happy too! But I'm determined that if she doesn't like something I do, no harm no foul she doesn't have to hear about it again. And if she likes something I don't know anything about, I will do everything I can to learn about it and support her. She's still a baby, so my wife and I still pick all of her clothes (some are nerdy, many are just cute) but I am very excited for her to grow up and find her own style and interests. So thank you for sharing, it really helped inspire me to be a better parent!", "Good for you, finding your voice and being your own person. I know everyone is different and entitled to like what they like, but Fandoms have really gotten out of hand in a lot of ways. You do not have to devote your entire life or personality to something you enjoy. Some people now feel like if you can't name the horoscope sign of a fictional character then you are not a \"true fan\". Interests are supposed to be fun and enjoyable. The moment you start putting so much effort into something it consumes you, is the time to take a break.", "I am glad you guys are working on things.", "Good on you OP. Congratulations on the early acceptance, and I hope you have just the best time at college. \ud83d\ude01", "It sounds like a little space will be good for you. I\u2019m a nerdy fandom person myself but everyone has their own things and this is a good time to build your own interests. I love my large crazy family in reasonable doses - and I do miss them as I live far away now- but I like having my own life and interests I built in the city I am now. Being a decent car ride away seems like the right amount of distance for you though.", "Congratulations!  I went to college in Colorado and never left.  It's a lovely state.", "If you want to be outdoors, you could have picked a lot worse the Colorado!   Congrats and enjoy some of the most beautiful mountains in the world.", "I haven\u2019t been this excited about a new student\u2019s acceptance letter since Harry got his invitation to Hogwarts.", "Enjoy watching coach prime and the buffaloes go crazy next year \ud83e\udee1", "I'm all teary now! \ud83e\udd72 I'm so happy for all of you! \u2764\ufe0f", "Glad that y'all worked it out and found a way to compromise and making better of your relationship \ud83d\udc4d :) also the \"irc=discord for old people\" made me chuckle, thanks lol :D", "I love Harry Potter. I'll never name my children after a character from those books or any other fantasy books/movies. \n\nI never understood people like your parents.", "What is IRC?", "This is a great update!", "OP, tell your parents that they remind this big Potterhead of Vernon & Petunia.\n\nP.S. What\u2019s your name?", "I remember your original post.\n\nAs someone who has a mild interest in fandom (& am old enough to remember being on IRC)\u2026 but who also likes hiking and other non-fan things, I\u2019m so glad that your parents were able to learn to give you your own space.\n\nI have multiple friends/acquaintances who sound exactly like your parents and I do worry about their kids being rejected for not liking fandom. \n\nGood luck with moving away for college. I hope with the space you can learn to be your own person, but also connect back with your family if that\u2019s what you\u2019d like.", "Women in Iran are getting murdered for showing their hair, but you can now finally breathe because your autistic nerd parents helped you change your name from Luna to Rachael or some shit. \n\nFirst world problems", "If this is real, I am so happy for you OP. I love the idea that as parents we will always be at least a little bit out of touch, no matter what we do to stay cool or relevant. They assume you are rebellious, but you may have a very different learning style from your parents. You may be more of a hands-on learner who needs to DO  things, to move your hands and body, and to get outside. \n\nSometimes people who don\u2019t learn as much by passively listening or watching don\u2019t enjoy movies and tv. That is valid. You might also not be as much of an uncritical consumer, and that\u2019s valid too. (I think people who embrace the nerd label don\u2019t think of their fandom as conspicuous consumption, but it sure can be.) \n\nI also have issues with *some* genre fiction, depending on the writer. It can be pretty predictable with too much minutiae. Fans don\u2019t like to hear that though. Some students I have had can only get interested in nonfiction, and that\u2019s a thing.  \n\nGood luck to you as you plan your adult life.", "So nice you got to stand to yourself. I hope you find your tribe and live your own life.\n\nBest regards", "If it helps my parents shared their interests with me, but in a very mild way. They would play computer games with me, read to me, show me movies they loved (that's how I saw Back to the Future and Monty Python for the first time). They just never made my life subordinate to their interests.", "Sorry but who cares?\n\nEven if you're right and this is someone outside of the states who came back a *year later* to post an update, it's a good story and people are allowed to upvote it if they want without superior trolls making them feel badly for it.\n\nHappy holidays you friggen Scrooge.", "My sister in law went to college at 17, it was even in Colorado lol.", "I guess you\u2019ve never complained or been upset about anything in your life because there\u2019s always someone in a worse situation.", "That's pretty much my goal. I don't ever want her to feel obligated to like something or think that it would make me happy if she pretended to like Star Wars or something. Like I know nothing about pottery, but if that's something that brings her joy I'd much rather invest time and money into pottery classes for her", "If OP was 15 at the original post, and 16-17 now. (they mentioned their birthday, so it's probably right on the borderline) they would still be just about to turn 18 when they go to college in the fall. Which is perfectly normal to do? Or am I missing something here?", "> I\u2019ve had my own insurance since like 14\n\nno you didn't lmao, you had insurance that your parents took out for you. A minor cannot sign a legally binding agreement, I don't know why this is so hard for you to understand.", "So much attitude. I started college, moved out of my parents house, and signed an apartment lease at 17. It\u2019s definitely possible.", "Who pissed in your coffee this morning? Sheesh. \n\nI went to college in a different state at 17 because of when my birthday is. My parents signed forms allowing me to live in a dorm. Parental authorization is a thing, and clearly OP's parents are on her side because her mom helped her choose a new name, which is something you'd need parental authorization for before 18. \n\nCalm down. Reading comprehension is a thing.", "Nah, Zazu is just being contrary. For some reason this post really triggered him/her.", "That\u2019s where you wrong though because I definitely had to sign for it but whatever man live in your own diluted world where your always right and everyone else has to be wrong."]}
