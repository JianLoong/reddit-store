It was totally unexpected. She was super close to her, and it hit her hard - she developed really bad depression. I tried my best to stay strong for Kelly and offer comfort whenever she needed it, but it has been so hard being her emotional crutch. Kelly stayed at home all day, quit her job and barely paid attention to me. I had to pay all the bills.\n\nSoon, I realised that our relationship was dying. Intimacy was long gone and Kelly rarely talked to me. I begged her to go to a therapist, and tried all ways to help her. She refused all of them. It broke my heart to see the woman I love fall to pieces.\n\nOn Friday, Kelly and I had an argument. I came home from a really bad day at work and found her surrounded by trash on the bed. I tiredly asked her to please clean it up, but she refused. Something just snapped in me, and I yelled \"I think it's time you get over your mom!\"\n\nKelly looked at me like I was crazy, and said \"How could you say such a thing? My mother is not like some shit ex, it's my mother! And she's dead.\" I apologized, but told Kelly to look at herself - no job, depressed, throwing away her life and relationship with her husband. She said \"It's already so hard, don't make it harder. I don't need you scolding me at the hardest point of my life!\" I tried to get my point across but she abruptly got mad - calling me a \"fucking asshole\" then left.\n\nI'll admit - what I said was horrible. It was unfair to Kelly. But I don't know what to do anymore. I feel burned out and I desperately need someone too, just like Kelly does. I feel so alone every minute of the day.

You'll get mauled here even though it's clear as day that you also need professional help to deal with your burnout and depression (and the grief of losing your love). Getting so much hate here won't do good to your mental health.\n\nEdit: I'm pleasantly surprised by seeing how much support OP got in the comments. I'm proud of you guys for not settling for seeing things in black or white!", "I'm sorry that both you and your wife are going through this.\n\nIt is difficult to go through depression, and it is difficult supporting someone going through depression.\n\nPerhaps you could see someone, a professional, to offload and discuss your own emotions, but also to work out how you can best support your wife.\n\nAgain, sorry you're both going through this - good luck, I hope you both get the assistance and support you need.", "NAH. \n\nI'm banking on your honesty that you truly tried to get therapy for your wife. I suggest that you consult with one yourself, to at least seek advice on how to get your wife to agree to go to therapy but also, possibly, because it seems like you recognize yourself that you can't help your wife forever this way.", "NAH here - it's a terrible situation. One thing is for sure, though. You must get your wife to therapy. She is depressed and nothing short of professional help can save her. Call someone - don't wait another day - a therapist, a grief group - someone to advise you of your local options", "Both you and your wife need professional help. She is deeply depressed and you are suffering from emotional and financial burnout.\n\nI don't think what you said was at all right. It was very hurtful, but I can also understand that sometimes things we want to express come out in entirely the wrong way under severe distress.", "NAH \nOP,  I think you need to sit down one last time with your wife and tell her that you can get her help, doctor, therapist whatever she needs calmly. If she refuse, tell her that you need to take care of you now, because you are not well. Take care of you now. Find a therapist or whatever you need. It is hard and sad and it sucks but at some point, you have to take care of you before you fall and can't get up. A person with depression have to have some willingness to help themselves to be able to get out of it. I have a close relative with major depression. It's been three years now. I tried for a long time, I cried so much, but there was nothing I could do. It's up to them now. Take care of yourself \u2764\ufe0f it is important", "Nah.\n\nYou're both suffering grief here. Her about the death of her mother, you over your relationship.\n\nTbh, I think you *both* need therapy. Could you suggest couples therapy to Kelly? She might be more receptive to the idea that you both need it, rather than just her. Maybe phrase it as \"I think we need help as a couple so that I can support you through your grief\".", "I'm not going to vote because after reading everything I believe you had an AH MOMENT after months of feeling lost in trying to figure out how to navigate this. \n\nI understand she's refusing therapy it seems but please,  you need to talk to someone to help you deal wth all of this as well.  And hopefully I'm doing that you'll find a way to help her get the help she needs as well. \n\nGood luck to you both.  I hope age can find healing and release.", "NTA. People die and it\u2019s devastating to us we felt lost and in so much pain but the fact is the world doesn\u2019t stop turning and we have responsibilities. Your wife isn\u2019t so much grieving as she is wallowing. She needs a boot up the backside. It\u2019s been almost a year and I get the grief and depression but when you refuse to do anything about that or get the help you need then that\u2019s on you. Time for the tough love. She either gets in therapy and gets herself together or she finds someone else to take her in and let her mooch off them.", "As someone who came out of depression, I completely recognise what's happening. You were patient and you pleaded with her to go to therapy. NTA. Sadly, your wife is lost.", "The way you freaked out at her sounds like anger that has been building up over the year. You need to sit her down and lay it all out without yelling. If she refuses to help herself or make steps in the right direction such as seeking therapy, it might be time for some permanent changes. Sure she is sad but it\u2019s been a year and she can\u2019t be depressed like this for the rest of her life. She needs to realize that your marriage won\u2019t make it much longer if things continue like this.", "A very gentle ESH, because you both suffer.\n\nOf yours you are TA for saying what you said, but your wife is TA for not getting any help for her depression and grief.  \nI highly suggest you to get help yourself as in find a therapist to help you with your own feelings and to find out how you want to proceed while your wife does not get help herself.  \n\n\nAlso suggest couples therapy - maybe maybe she will agree to that. Your wife needs help, but as long as she does not want it you can not really make her get it. Which means you need to get help to help you deal with your own emotions, loneliness and grief over your wifes and your situation.  \n\n\nGood luck, i feel for both of you. Its an impossible situation and none of you is really at fault or really an A.", "NTA.  The title made me think you were being terrible, but I understand.  After apologizing again for your outburst and poor word choice, you should explain your feelings to her.  Tell her that you can't continue to live like this and if she wants to stay married then she needs to get help.  Best wishes!", "In my book NTA. I knew a lady who\u2019s mother passed on Christmas Eve on her way to her house. 10 years later she still would not take down the Christmas tree and the presents. This messed up the family. Husband, kids\u2026everyone. Grief comes in all stages, it\u2019s horrible but he and the kids grieved of the grandmother, the mother who would not accept and get help. She\u2019s alone now\u2026with the Christmas tree still up. No one has the right to say he\u2019s the AH. He\u2019s messed up to!", "I can empathise with why you snapped. You have stated that you\u2019ve tried to get her help multiple times and she refuses. Right now she seems to be stuck in her grief, unable or unwilling to move forward. Your resentment has now built up to the point where you snapped. This is a situation where ESH for the way you\u2019re both dealing with this, but also NAH because grief is awful and has it\u2019s own timeline and it\u2019s hard to sustain a relationship where there is no emotional return. \n\nYou can\u2019t make her help herself. All you can do is decide whether this is something you can live with or not. If you can\u2019t live like this anymore, it doesn\u2019t make you TA. But it doesn\u2019t mean you have some hard decisions to make. Apologise for the outburst, but sit down with her and make it clear what actions you will need to take if things don\u2019t change now.", "NTA.\n\nIf she won't go to therapy, you're going to have to leave. You can't help her if she won't help herself. Everyone has a breaking point and I'm not going to say you're an asshole for reaching yours.", "NAH. You're wife is in severe depression, and you've offered to help, but she refuses. Was the response the best, no, but I understand the frustration of seeing someone who needs help and they refuse. Hopefully you can get some therapy for yourself and maybe you could convince her to at least do some couples counseling. If she doesn't want to leave the house maybe look on something like betterhelp where she could just do it at home. This is a tough situation.", "I understand why you said what you said but it was super out of line :/", "NAH your wife need grief therapy. She can't manage to get over it alone. Time doesn't heal all wounds, sometimes it need professionell help.", "It\u2019s taken me over 2 years to get over my dad passing. It\u2019s like waves - some waves are worse and some ebb with good memories. And it\u2019s shit.\n\nI feel for you both - your wife is clearly in deep grief and not seeking help which is affecting your marriage and life together. She needs therapy and you both need couples therapy. And I\u2019ll be honest - you may not survive as a couple on the other side. I wish and hope you both come through the other side with help and healing.\n\nNAH", "I don\u2019t think your delivery was the best but she had to help herself. NTA maybe try to set up couples counseling? That way she goes to see a therapist and hopefully see the value and go by herself as well", " NTA. Your wife needs real, professional help. You are not a psychologist. Your support can only go so far.\n\nIf she's refusing to get the help she needs, it's ok to think about what you need. If you can't do this anymore maybe you leaving will be the catalyst for her to finally get help.\n\nIf you can get her to marriage counseling to get through to her, try. But almost a year like this ... yeah, I'd think about leaving for my own mental health. I would try to get her to see the pros and sadly move on if she won't get help. Good luck to both of you.", "NAH.  Sorry for your loss.  And for hers.", "Dude you both need professional help. You are carrying all the burden at the moment and you are struggling. You have reached a breaking point where you cannot take it anymore.", "NTA. That's an impossible situation to be in. Your wife is absolutely depressed and not hard to see why but unfortunately you can't force her to get help. You need to get therapy to help you deal with the burnout and decide whether or not you can stay around.", "YTA\u2026 but don\u2019t listen to the blatant character assassination.  Your wife lost her mother, and you are losing your wife.  You\u2019re both dealing with incredibly difficult situations, and seemingly neither of you is handling them in the healthiest possible way.  The truth is, this situation is likely far beyond your ability to solve on your own, especially given your wife\u2019s inability to contribute at the moment.  Professional help is likely your only course of action, and while you have tried and failed to accomplish that in the past, it is still your best and only option as I see it.  You seem to recognize already that what you said was hurtful and unhelpful, but the emotions that brought those words to the surface need to be addressed, or that will likely not be the last time you say something you regret to her.", "NTA\nMate as few people already suggested, delete the post, you'd find good advice very less as people will be far too busy attacking you. And as for your wife, you can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped, 11 months is a long time and if the person is not even trying 1%, then you can't do anything about it, at some point you'd have to start looking out for yourself and your health as well.", "Up until the last paragraph, I'd been set on Y-T-A, but given what you've said in your last two sentence....It sounds like you'd both benefit from therapy, individually and together. \n\nWhat you said was an absolutely shitty thing to say, but **IF** (big *if* here) it brings about a conversation about the way things have been and brings Kelly to seek help, maybe in the long-run beneficial. However, it also comes with a second if, if your relationship can survive her memory of and pain due to you saying that to her. \n\nFrom what you've said, you've tried to encourage Kelly to seek help with her grief and depression, but if is a lot harder for people to accept help if they don't first accept they need help.", "ESH, YTA for saying it but so is she for shutting down for 11 months. Everyone is responsible for their own mental health in a relationship and doing nothing to improve things is just disrespect of the highest regard.", "NTA\n\nYes your wife is griefing and can take a long time.\nBut it is at the point were its negativly affecting you.\nIt seems you did all to help her, but she refuses.\n\nIf she does not want to accept help, there is nothing you can do anymore.\n\nMaybe try to sit her down, and express your feelings and that she has to start atleast trying to get better and accepting help. \nAnd if it dosent help set an ultimatum, or both of your lifes get riuned.", "YTA  \nYour wife is dealing with severe depression and your brilliant suggestion is to get over it? You even admit what you said was horrible. How do you need help trying to figure out if it makes you an asshole? Yes, yes it does.", "To answer your question yes, YTA for snapping at her to \u201cget over her dead mom\u201d it was incredibly callous. But I also am sympathetic that she needs help and you\u2019re burnt out. So sorry.", "YTA. Not for feeling rejected and trying to get your wife to get help and not succeeding, but for going nuclear and saying she needs to get over it - at less than a year of grieving. Your wife does need help, I guarantee you this won\u2019t make her do it.", "YTA. Grief has no timeframe and this was her *mother*. Yes, she should get grief counselling and therapy and get on meds. You are right there,  but it hasn't even been a year since her mom's death. You don't go snapping like this. If it was three, four years down the line then maybe, but not less than a year.", "What would ever possesss you to write out that title and still wonder. YTA", "YTA. She lost her mom barely a year ago. That was REALLY cruel to say.", "YTA. That's not how you treat someone dealing with grief. Yes, she needs therapy. Seek professional advice on how to get help for her.", "YTA. Research grief and educate yourself. Way out of line dude.", "YTA oh no poor you your wife is struggling with severe depression but the intimacy has gone from your relationship. Shouting at her to get over it is not going to help, if anything you risk pushing her over the edge and making things a lot worse. If she\u2019s been like this for 11 months chances are she isn\u2019t going to improve without professional help", "You\u2019re right and wrong. She does need to get over it or accept whatever has happened happened. I believe there are more subtle ways to initiate. Such as letting her know that if her mother saw her now she would be disappointed at how she is living. Her mother would not want to look down and see that shes sad, depressed, and throwing her life away. So in a reverse psychology sense. Let her know that she needs to live again so that her moms birth to her was not a waste. Love to the fullest so that if her mom \u201cwas\u201d alive, she\u2019d be proud. Not even physiologically, thats real.", "Oh sir let me tell YOU. \n\nYou are most certainly 100% without a shadow of a doubt the biggest YTA of the week in this sub. What a despicable thing to say to someone youre supposed to love.", "YTA. Your want her to get therapy, do this do that but you get to unload on her like that? No sir.  You can be stressed , you can be frustrated,  but telling someone to get over a parent's death is sick.  Especially a sudden death. My mom is my bestfriend and I'd be in the same place as you gf. She will recover in her own time", "YTA. I assume if your parents died, you would be over it in no time. Your wife needs support not abuse from you. You have no compassion.", "YTA. A huge one too. Grief has no timeline. Losing a mother is heartbreaking. Stop being a dick and support your wife emotionally.", "YTA. Without a doubt.", "What your wife called you? That's what you are. Someday you will lose someone you love and will be deeply ashamed of yourself. YTA.", "Why even post this?  It has been ten years since my mom died suddenly and I'm still not over it.  YTA.", "Id say NAH because if it\u2019s true that she lost her mom, and that what you said would generally be out of line, the world doesn\u2019t stop \"just because\" she\u2019s grieving. It\u2019s understandable that she spiraled into a depression, but her not accepting therapy and actively not accepting any activity that could help her mental health makes you nta. If she doesn\u2019t do anything to get out of this mental state, she will be stuck like that for years. Grief comes in multiple stages and you cant remain in the same one forever. Her mother wouldn\u2019t want her to throw her life away like that. I think you guys should try more discussions, but i dont think she will hear you out for a while", "ESH\n\nThis is beyond both of you now. Either shift into a mode to get help, or end it", "YTA for what you said but I understand where you\u2019re coming. You would not be the asshole if you decide to leave. As you said, you need someone too. I would not bring up the mom again but I would leave someone who refuses to help themselves.", "YTA - you cannot possibly be this stupid to ask. Oh no your wife isn\u2019t fucking you? Oh no your wife isn\u2019t completely ok after her mother died in a horrible way unexpectedly? You\u2019re disgusting. And I hope she leaves.", "YTAH she\u2019s grieving the loss of her MOTHER and you tell her to get over it you can\u2019t put a time limit of grief you heartless ahole", "I understand why you said it, but have you offered to go WITH her to therapy or send HER TO therapy? Big difference and I think the former would be beneficial to your situation.", "YTA! \nIf your wife has other family around, maybe get them to come talk to her or even see if you can get professional help to talk to her, at the house.", "Yta but at least you apologised. I hope you can overcome this as a couple, she needs support as well as you, it can be very difficult for some people to accept and seek out help. All the best to you both in this tough situation.", "Soft YTA, because you were an AH for what you said\n\nBut obviously, you both need therapy (especially Kelly), and it's a real shame she's not in the headspace to realize it. Hopefully, you at least get some for yourself for your own peace of mind and to help you navigate this situation. And hopefully, in time, Kelly will be able to bring herself to get the help she desperately needs.\n\nAnd get into therapy sooner rather than later. If this happened 11 months ago, the one year anniversary is coming up, and there's a good chance Kelly will take a turn for the worse. You do not want to be without emotional support when that happens.\n\nGood luck.", "NAH.  I get why you snapped but you shouldn't have said what you did.  I'm glad you realized very quickly that you were out of line but as soon as you said that, any chance of civil conversation went out the window.\n\nYou both need individual counseling and marriage counseling.", "NAH- I\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019re going through this", "NAH, you were at your whits end your wife has spiralled, you both need to attend couples therapy. Your wife also needs help to cope with her grief.", "People die. People we love die. It is a fact. I do not see this as working unless OP withdraws his support.

That doesn\u2019t make him an A-Hole, it makes him human.", "Unfortunately, that is accurate. Unless she is an obvious danger to herself or others, which it doesn't sound like she is, OP can't force her to talk to anyone.", "True. Still doesn't make him any less of an asshole.", "Absolutely. And he's still the asshole. He's only the asshole for what he said. He knows it's horrible. He knows he's the asshole for saying it. If he has asked if he was the asshole for reaching his breaking point, I'd say no, but that isn't what he asked.", "I didn\u2019t mean \u201cget over it\u201d, It was only implied to the post, but I meant more of accepting. I get it too. My father has also passed 13yrs now for me, two uncles, also a few friends. I understand sadness and grief. I also chose to accept the cycle of life and try my best to be the best version of myself even knowing that my life may end at end given moment. Just imagine yourself on the opposite end. If you were dead and looked at someone you love, how would you want them to be? Sad a depressed and going downhill? Or grieving and trying?", "Plenty of people who are grieving refuse help in the beginning.  Anyone dealing with a grieving partner needs to educate themselves on this cycle their partner is going through. It's rough, it's not easy. But pushing help, pushing therapy, on someone who isn't ready is going to backpeddle any recovery made.", "Oh my god, you said it beautifully! I need to remember this.", "To each their own", "I have to admit you are totaly right.\nI have nothing to disagree.", "I agree with your statement in general, but it's been 11 months and it's hasn't moved passed the beginning. Nah", "Are you honestly suggesting that telling someone to get over their dead mother doesn't make that person an asshole? As I've already said, he has to decide what to do as far as staying with her or not, but being a dick about it isn't going to win him any awards.", "Grief is not measured by time. And shouldn't be. Educate yourself", "Not saying that. When you refuse all help and expect everyone to go along with it, no you can\u2019t blame him. She refuses help. Should he have said what he said no, but she shouldn\u2019t expect everyone to constantly cater to her mental state. I\u2019ve been in deep depression. I get it, but i don\u2019t get expected people to cater to a mindset", "I agree, but refusing to even acknowledge there is a problem and to refuse therapy after that amount of time is not fair to the partner either. I lost my dad in 2020. It sucks. I was broken. It hurt my partner. That hurt me even more, so I slowly worked on getting better.", "But that wasn't the question he asked. He asked AITA for telling her to get over it. Either you get that or you don't. If you get that, then the answer is yes. If you want to debate how her depression has affected HIM so severely that he might have no choice but to cut ties with her, and would he not be the asshole for that, that's a different question entirely.", "I get that, and the answer is no.\n\nWallowing in grief helps no one. People should want to move on from that. There's a time for it, certainly. But at this point it's holding up her life.\n\nThe way to help deal with it is to go to therapy. OP's wife has turned that down. One can only assume that her plan, therefore, is to deal with it herself. Telling her to get over it seems the best OP can do.", "I based them off all the information given.", "No it's not the best he can do. He admits it himself that he said it out of anger, not to help her. And when did telling someone to get over grief, especially grief less than a year old, helped anyone? I have PTSD from losing my brother and that happened forever ago. I still have bouts with grief, and I barely survived that first year.  \n\n\nIn the end, his wife has severe depression, and he doesn't seem to have asked her what she needs, or what he could do to help her. Suggesting therapy isn't an automatic cure-all, even if the person agrees to the therapy."]}
