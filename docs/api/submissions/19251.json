Maybe look up the POLST form (advanced directive) for your state.  Print it out and when your FIL is having a better than average moment - maybe before he's had too much to drink in the morning - tell him that you understand he wants more control over medical decisions so you found the form for him and he can check off what type of care he does and does not want, and that you'll respect his requests.\n\nYes, I know he's not behaving like a reasonable adult.  But you can still give it a shot and it might help.", "NTA... you saved his life. ylu are not perfect, he is old and requires more patience now.
