Alcoholics r a special kind of person and all I can say is maintain firm boundaries and don't b too hard on ureelf for snapping at him. He begged for it.

He's aware this is his own fault, but rather tha accept that he needs (wants, but to him it's a need) all bad choices and bad consequences to b someone else fault, cuz they sure ain't his.

He's wrong, but having a seizure is very impactful on your moods cognition etc for a few days after.

I didn't want to use the word \"toxic\" for that exact reason but it hit the nail on the head so well. Interactions such as this are almost a daily occurrence. It's heart breaking watching someone you love, live like this. But it is absolutely emotionally poisonous. It's like a dark cloud that hovers over everyone and everything.", "It's absolutely a cry for help; one he refuses to admit. I know that easier said than done, to be fair. And convincing him to go to rehab would require him sitting down to listen to someone for more than 30 seconds without interrupting, walking away, or changing the subject. \n\nHonestly, the idea of just leaving him alone to his own demise has been a thought floating around the family for some time.

If u dont have insurance then ur severely limited in what hospitals will take u, and they r only legally required to give u the bare minimum to save ur life. Then they can stop treatment and discharge u unless u can settle a good portion of the bill now. And most insurance will onpu cover a percentage of the cost of all this.", "I find this terryifying to even think about. I went to ER last week because I was in pain. Was there for five hours, multiple blood tests, x-ray, CT scan, specialist doctor...walked out without paying/owing a thing.  And with a calming diagnosis, too!", "My experience in the US goes like this. For some context I have a severely messed up knee, torn cartilage in both joints of that leg and multiple dislocations. Every few years it does it again. I know it did it again. So off to doctor I go. Usually urgent care clinic where rhey do xrays and (shocker! Nothing is broken). They sometimes decide I need an MRI, sometimes, and then I gotta get a referral for one and wait weeks to get a call giving me my appointment. Would b same if I went to the ER instead, but that takes way longer and I don't wanna b there for hours and hours. Get the MRI done, by now it's at best been 3 weeks, at worst 3 months since original injury. The I gotta get another docitrs appointment so they can refer me to either an orthopedic(50/50) or physical therapy. They give me # or a list and I have to contact them to set up appointments. Specialist can again b weeks. They will also refer me to physical therapy, again. I lived in a big city for years, and only difference was it took less time to get appointments, but it was never less than 2 weeks wait. Now I live super rural in Montana near Glacier Park. Depending on my u strange at the time I can get it fully covered, that's rare, it's usually at beat 80% with 100% paid only after u exceed ur deductible which is annual and usually tied to jan to Dec calendar year. Most cover parts of each individual thing, ex fully covered for urgent care, 50% for specialist. And almost all have a co-pay that is due at the beginning of 3ach and every appointment ($30+ every single time, and no that doesn't count towards ur deductible).", "Nta.

OP is clearly NTA, but where she went wrong was when she decided to actually stay in the room and engage with him when he started berating her. \n\nFirst off, I'm not blaming the seizure for his behavior, although you're probably right and it at least made him worse. I'm blaming the fact that this guy is a hardcore alcoholic and has been for a long time. I have no doubt that the seizure is a symptom of decades of drinking. And he's probably so far gone that trying to reason with him AT ALL when he gets upset is completely pointless.\n\nMy therapist actual advised me to do this when dealing with my bipolar father. The second he becomes abusive, walk out of the room. Every single time. He'll rage and complain. But you will \"win\" the argument every time.

I agree \ud83d\udc4d", "The seizure was probably related to the alcoholism, it\u2019s a common reaction to withdrawals for alcoholics and can be deadly or cause brain damage.  Someone needs to tell him it\u2019s time to get help or stop enabling him, next time MIL needs help bring her to their house and leave him at his.  Also the doc needs to know he\u2019s a major alcoholic because that will impact everything they do and decide on response to his care.  Yes you\u2019re altered after a seizure but it generally causes confusion and slow reactions not abusive outbursts so he was likely past that stage when he responded the way he did.", "Again, clearly have never had a seizure", "I don\u2019t care.", "And I'm supposed to care about you? \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23"]}
