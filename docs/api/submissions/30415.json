My wife brought a daughter - Lilly (15 F) into the relationship, Lilly was a one nightstand that occurred when my wife was in college the whole situation was significantly traumatic for her. Shortly after Lilly was born my wife\u2019s parents took Lilly in while my wife moved across the country to pursue her career and grow as a person. \n\nFrom then on it\u2019s been a constant battle between who takes care of Lilly, when Lilly was 6 her paternal grandparents took her in, then when she was 8 it was her paternal aunt, then when she was 10-12 it was shared between my wife and her parents. From 12 onwards it\u2019s been solely my wife taking care of her. \n\nLilly and I both moved in with my wife around the same time, and due to my wife\u2019s request I attempted to form a bond with her. Now, I must admit I had skepticism initially due to the amount of homes she\u2019s been cycled through, so I feared a lot but I pushed through for my wife\u2019s sake. I have struggled significantly although\u2026Lilly in my opinion is manipulative and a pathological liar. Living with her has been awful, and my wife turns a blind eye and refuses to acknowledge or do much about her behavior because she feels guilt for not being there for her much when she was younger. Everyday is a nightmare because she does things to provoke everyone around her, i\u2019ve never met more of a conniving and vindictive child. \n\nRecently, Lilly\u2019s father has been trying to play a more active role in her life and Lilly has not been completely open to the idea. Recently, Lilly\u2019s father took her on a trip to and has been pushing for taking complete custody of her- my wife has disagreed completely saying it will uproot her life and that as her mother she knows what\u2019s best for her. \n\nAbout a week ago Lilly\u2019s father came and dropped her off after spending some time with her and he asked me about the likelihood of my wife changing my mind about full custody, I said the chances were slim but in my opinion I think it would be best for everyone. He then asked me to put a good word in for him and try to convince her on his behalf. \n\nA couple days ago I brought the situation up and my wife dismissed it, but I kept pushing (maybe my fault). Nonetheless, she snapped at me saying I always hated Lilly and that she didn\u2019t understand how I a grown man could have such a grudge towards a child. She berated me for 5 or so minutes, then stormed off called me an a hole and has been accusing me of countless things to family and friends.
