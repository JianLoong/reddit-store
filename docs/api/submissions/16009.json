What a horrific request, and I can't imagine how the sister will feel if she finds out. \"Sorry, we tried to have you edited out of our family photos because your wheelchair doesn't fit our vibe.\" Absolutely repellent behavior. Photos \"not usable\" because a family member in a wheelchair is in them. I'm just gobsmacked by how gross that is, and they just say it out loud and try to convince you they're in the right.\n\nI guess this is a kind of nature photography. You captured some really ugly venomous creatures in the wild there.", "I think you should tell the sister. Offer her any photos of herself. And be sure to tell anyone who comes to you just how awful your cousin is\n\nYou're doing the right thing\n\nNTA", "NTA. Keep in mind moving forward exactly what kind of people they are.", "Absolutely nta. I'm a photographer and I do weddings and events. If the wedding party doesn't make their wishes known up front,  then that's just too bad. But in this case, had they told me something like that upfront, I also wouldn't be their photographer.", "Give Dans sister a copy of all the photos with her in them,.  Let her know that they might edit her out ion the future and she should know about it.\n\nwash your hands of the whole thing and go NC.", "No payment? I'd honestly delete all the photos then and wash my hands of it for real.\n\nNTA", "NTA at all. Stand by your principles. They need to pay you regardless and you are well within your rights (and reasonably so, to sue or withhold photos pending payment). \nAnyone who tries to suggest YTA is gaslighting you and being manipulative.", "NTA, thank you for standing up for his sister.  He is disgusting to want her out of the photos and her chair not show.  He needs to FOAD. Do his parents know?", "NTA by any degree. Don't give them the photos if they don't pay for them, and if your distribution rights allow, send the sister the original photos. That way she a) has the photos from an otherwise-lovely day and b) if an edited photo creeps into the family album, she has the originals to set the record.", "Does he have other family?", "Make sure you give them .jpeg, not raw. At least any edits they try will look like sh*t.", "NTA. What awful people.", "NTA, buy holy crap they are!! What horrible people. You should collect your payment for your work and be done with them completely.", "NTAH- your gut reaction is the correct one- the ick factor of asking someone to edit out someone\u2019s medically necessary equipment is just gross. \nI would make sure there is a copyright notification on every photo somehow and a warning included that any alteration of photos is a violation of copyright law and subject to monetary damages.", "Nta. What they want is mean & ugly. I wouldn't do it either", "NTA and I am in awe of you to be honest, I wish there were more people like yourself. I am so sorry you don\u2019t get the money but I\u2019m so glad you locked the contract so they can\u2019t edit this lady out. How disrespectful are they.", "No, NTA.\n\nIf Dan dislikes his sister in her natural state so much as to wanting her removed from the pictures, he should not have invited her.\n\nI hope that he doesn't edit her out himself and have her ever see that he thinks she is so unsightly that he would remove her from his wedding photos. Most people that I know who use a wheelchair see it as an extension of themselves. Making it look like it doesn't exist is removing a part of her.\n\nThe vibe is that they think she's some sort of leper. Something to be ashamed of and she is not.\n\nStay true to yourself, you are making the right decision.", "NTA. They probably asked you to be the photographer because they couldn\u2019t ask a stranger to edit a disabled person out. It will be interesting g to see how the wedding goes. I personally would be petty and let this info \u201caccidentally\u201d out to other family members.", "NTA. Unless his sister herself asked to have her chair edited out & makes that clear to you personally, don't do it!", "NTA\n\nWhy would you edit a disability out? Wtf", "Don't put the sister in the position to have to defend herself against something obviously wrong. OP is already being a good ally for outright refusing.  \n  \nIf OP wants to let the sister know, just say they want to give a heads up that if she sees any pics where she's been edited into a chair that you refused to do that and the Asshole Twins have breached your contract.  \n  \nBut if they don't pay then there is no valid contract anyway, right, OP? I know you don't want to withhold their photos but you deserve payment and if they don't pay then you don't have to worry about them finding someone else to support their insane ableism.", "You should absolutely tell them Dan is being bad family to his sister.", "Okay I enjoy some of the openly petty comments on these posts, I\u2019ve never made one myself and now it\u2019s my turn, I honestly would fully support you editing out the bride to be or groom in each photo, alternate between who you edit out between the two of them, heck even edit in a wheelchair in their place, when they complain say \u201cI\u2019m wheely sorry I thought I did a good job\u201d. This has to be the most despicable pair of jizzcocks known to man, they definitely sound like they deserve one another. NTA\n\nEdit: I read this story aloud to my husband and he said what a pair of nazi\u2019s, erasing someone because they\u2019re disabled.", "We hate Dan!", "Warn the sister too", "This is horrifying. What horrible people. NTA. If you give them the photos you should really get paid for the work you did (I\u2019m sure the contract did not include photoshop right?) and if they refuse I would not give them the photos. If they co to ie to harass you and be dicks about it then I would consider making the reason for this dust up public knowledge within the family. Is your cousin the giant AH she seems to be by nature, or is the fianc\u00e9 bringing out this hitherto-for latent assholery? Either way he seems like a toxic addition to the family and the family should know what kind of a snake they are bringing in to the fold. NTA of course", "YWNBTA(NTA) for refusing.  I salute you for standing for your principles and normal human decency.  Dan and Rachel are TAs , Aunt and Uncle too given you\u2019ve said they know what D&A asked you to do and still want you to \u2018work with them\u2019.", "NTA. And personally? I\u2019d tell them to shut up and leave me alone before I started getting noisy about what they were asking. Via any means available.", "I am sorry but I am a pretty good user of PS and changing a wheelchair to another chair is pretty hard, time consuming and depending on the pose impossible (chair dimension, arm handles, position of body and arms....). PS can do magical things but this is many HD photos is not an easy task if not impossible in some. Just saying...", "NTA!!!! Omg, my jaw dropped when I read what they asked you to do. You should absolutely stick to your guns on this, including enforcing the contract if you have the spoons to do so. \n\nThe fact that Dan is supporting Rachel in this is just disgusting.", "Not free. OP charged the local market rate minus a 10% family discount. \n\nI\u2019m not saying he\u2019s TA, nor that they aren\u2019t AH\u2019s. Just clarifying the facts for you. \n\nBut now I\u2019m thinking\u2026it was pretty shady to charge market rate even with the family discount (because that would be in place regardless) when they fully admit that this isn\u2019t their professional niche. A baker who specializes in pastries and makes a wedding cake for their cousin should *not* charge whatever a local cake baker charges for something outside of their wheelhouse.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I think she needs to know. Ofcourse they would be really mad about it. But this makes me so sad."]}
