His prognosis is excellent because it was caught early and he's an excellent candidate for BMT and was quickly found a match. However the treatment has been brutal and it should go into maintenance by fall when starts the 3rd grade. \n\nUnfortunately he can't really play with other kids because his immune system is compromised. We're lucky that we have a sitter who can be a playmate and a caretaker who isn't a parent if me or his mom can't be there. Someone who knows how to dispense his meds, bathe him, follow dietitian guidelines and keeping him entertained.\n\nThe other day our sitter asked if it would be okay to pray with Owen. I was taken by surprise because in the few years that we've known him and worked for us, he's never mentioned religion. I thought he was Mormon because he has five brothers and his family look like they're from the 1950s.\n\nI'm a closet reluctant atheist and my wife is agnostic. Our kids go to a private Catholic school mainly because for its academics and extracurricular activities and it's mostly secular. If our kids want to follow a religion then that's up to them as adults. Our sitter knows this.\n\nI told him I'd rather have him take care of Owen. I believe prayer is bullshit like Bigfoot and no need to make Owen feel like a prayer is going to cure his cancer. That's false hope. I said he's free to pray for him, not with him.\n\nEver since then things have been awkward between us.

Did you tell him that you believe prayer is bs like Bigfoot or did you skip that bit?", "OP for context:\n\nDid you say to the carer that prayer was bullshit like bigfoot and praying won't solve his cancer, or are you just giving examples of your thoughts? Or did you just say you'd rather he didn't pray with Owen?\n\n**EDIT**\n\nOP actually said these claims to a religious persons face and then was confused why they seem off with them after \ud83d\udc80\n\nYTA, 100% unequivocally. I'm a through and through atheist, no one will ever convince me otherwise. But I also understand just how important religion is to people in so many ways, and I would never in a million years try and put down and mock someone's religious beliefs just because they don't align with my own beliefs.\n\nThat was an absolutely disgusting thing to say OP, you need to say sorry immediately. As a parent myself, my heart honestly goes out to you regarding Owen OP, I can't even begin to imagine the shit you and your brave little soldier have gone through, and still continue to go through.\n\n I can understand your ill feelings towards the idea of praying to a  \"god\" that would have allowed this to happen to your son in the first place....but come on, you must understand that what you said was below the belt and warrants an apology at the very least.", "YTA because of your approach.\n\nYou insulted the one person that sounds like a perfect care giver to your child.  You could have handled it much better.  When he leaves, think about how to respond like a mature adult.", "YTA. I initially thought this would be a story where you discovered the Nanny proselytizing your son. This, though?  The nanny asked if he could pray with a sick child. He did not attempt to do so behind your back or say that it would cure him BUT ONLY IF HE GIVES HIS LIFE TO JESUS...he just wanted to pray with him.\n\nYou are perfectly within your rights as a parent to tell him that you would prefer they not pray together. You never should have been that cruel in your refusal.\n\nThis nanny has been caring for your child for years and has watched him go through treatments and pain that no one, much less a child, would have an easy time with. He wanted to share good thoughts and feelings and support in a way that he would have wanted for himself. It would have been so simple to end the conversation a sentence before you alienated someone that doesn't seem to have been anything other than a wonderful caregiver for your son. 'Thank you so much for your prayers, and I truly appreciate the offer. We would prefer to let Owen make his own decisions about prayer/religion when he gets a little older.'  \n\n\n'PRAY TO BIGFOOT, GET FALSE HOPE' is insulting and incredibly pessimistic. IT'S FALSE HOPE makes it sound like you don't think there will be a positive outcome and that's...I'm not going to touch that any further. Yikes. BIGFOOT REEEEEE is just silly, edgy, fedora-hat-tipping-m'lady-nose-dripping nonsense that gets turned into pearl-clutch-inducing soundbites and clips and memes for the facebooks. That is why they think atheists are evil. Now because you wanted to be a big meanie-head you've probably not only lost a good nanny, but also whatever respect he may have had for you. ~~Also I'm sure there's some kind of 'ism to describe~~ *~~'I thought they were Mormon, he has five brothers and they look like they're from the 50's'~~*\n\nYou may believe that prayer does nothing, but the nanny believes it will help and if he wants to put that positive energy out into the universe, let him do it. It literally hurts *nothing* for the Nanny to pray for your son. How does it make you this mad to know that someone who has cared for your kiddo is rooting for him and wants to put in a good word with his favorite deity? I bet you were a riot when Owen asked you about Santa and the Tooth Fairy and the Easter bunny.\n\nBesides, your kid is in Catholic school. Most Catholic schools, even the very neutral ones, don't hide prayer from non-Catholic students. It seems a bit hypocritical of you to pay (usually out the nose) to put him in Catholic school, yet be SHOOKETH when someone wants to pray with your kid and smug enough to tell them to go pray to their bigfoot but leave him out of it. Maybe the Nanny thought you guys were Catholic and had absolutely no clue that you're a 'closet reluctant atheist.'", "YTA \n\nYou wouldn\u2019t have been if you had declined politely, respectfully. But you didn\u2019t. \n\nIf you had kept the \u201cBigfoot/false hope\u201d to yourself instead of saying it to his face, then I would say not TA. I am atheist, so I kind of agree with you, but I know well enough that you respect an individual\u2019s religion and beliefs. You don\u2019t say things like that to them, even if you think it. \n\nThis was a *\u201dDid I say the quiet thing out loud?\u201d* moment. You ought to apologise and say that whilst you respect his beliefs, you do not share them, and would rather he not pray *with* your son\u2014as is your right as a parent. \n\nAside from that, I really am sorry that your family is going through this. It\u2019s an awful thing for anyone, but to imagine a child going through it hurts my heart. I hope for the best possible outcome for him, and for you.\n\nEdit: missed words.", "YTA\n\nHe was polite in asking, you were an asshole when you said how religion wasn\u2019t real.

One day, the office religious person asked if he could pray for said manager, and the manager responded, \"Thank you, I need all the help I can get.\" I always thought that was rather very diplomatic of him.\n\nMaybe try and be polite to the carer who you claim is a great help.", "YTA\n\nYou were free to decline his request. There was no reason to be a dick about it. \n\nBut I hope all goes well for you guys. A very dear friend's child just finished his maintenance treatment, rang the bell, and gets to move on with life. There were some really low points, but it has all paid off.", "Atheist here, and YTA and a rude one. There was no need to go about it the way you did. Maybe he thought you were religious because HELLO,  you pay to send your son to a freaking religious school. Which is odd.", "YTA for how you said no.

YTA You can decline the offer to pray with your son, alto it's really up to your son and not you whether he wants to pray or not, but you don't have to be an ass about it. A simple \"no, thank you\" will suffice.", "YTA its weird that you have him in a religious school that 100% teaches religion on some level and prays everyday im sure.

N T A for not wanting him to pray with Owen, but you were a dick when a simple \"no, it would not be okay\" would have sufficed.", "YTA. You have someone absolutely irreplaceable for Owen right now and you needed to die on this hill? Someone who cares for him wants to try to help him in a way that is almost completely harmless, especially since you send your children to a religious school, so you already have to explain that some people believe different things and that they can make up their own mind as they see fit. \n\nThe caregiver is not a robot. He probably is struggling like anyone would be to care for a very sick little boy. He thinks prayer will help and you mocked his (yes, dumb) beliefs. Asshole move, apologize and try to fix this or your son may lose his only playmate.", "YTA you send your kids to a religious school where I guarantee they\u2019re praying and you were very rude to him and mocked his religion. Don\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019re looking for a new caretaker soon", "YTA for going overboard with your explanation. You could have just said no thank you, but you appreciate everything he's doing to help. Instead you insulted him and his belief system.", "Info: What are Owens thoughts on prayers?

Because unless you said that to his face, he definitely doesn't have a leg to stand on.", "YTA and a big one too.", "YTA. It would have been understandable for you to politely decline, but the way you talked about this person\u2019s beliefs to their face was incredibly rude and I could absolutely understand why they would be uncomfortable around you. Your nanny seems like he was trying to help in one of the ways he knows how, and you shot him down much much harder than you should have. You should have some respect, especially for the person who is taking care of your child! (By the way, if your kids are going to a catholic school, they are absolutely praying at least once a day).", "YTA for how you handled it. \n\nSaying no thank you would have been just fine, but no you had to go and be rude about it.

YTA.", "N T A for not wanting someone to pray with your son, even if he goes to a religious school. There is a big difference between occasionally praying in a large group for world peace or other abstract things like that, or praying privately with someone he knows well for something that is very specific and unlikely to happen through prayer. \nYTA for unnecessarily insulting someone who wanted to offer help in the best way they know. Religion and prayer is probably an important part of their life and even if you don't want your son involved in that, you have no right to insult them", "NTA for making that call but I will say it strikes me as a tad odd when you send your kids to Catholic school. It may be relatively secular but there are almost certainly moments of prayer, preaching, and mentions of God. If you're ok with that, it just seems strange that you would object to this. I don't blame you for not wanting the sitter to pray with your son, but I'm surprised that sentiment isn't extended to his school as well.", "I think if you just would have said that your son shouldn't think a prayer cured him and that the carer is still free to pray for your son in private, you wnbta, but the Bigfoot comment and that prayer is bs was unnecessary", "A simple thank you for praying for Owen would have sufficed.

I am an atheist and feel similarly about religious beliefs as you do. I do dislike that there\u2019s a certain\u2026emotional fragility? Extreme personal attachment? around religion and I do not think it should be off limits in terms of discussion and interrogation as you would with any other beliefs. However, I would generally only have these sorts of discussions with very close friends. Critiquing beliefs isn\u2019t necessarily critiquing the person, but I\u2019m not sure that came across in your approach.", "YTA. What exactly is the harm in your kid getting some hope? So what if its false? He is going through hell. And then you had the audacity to say these things to the sitters face.

It\u2019s not that strange of him to *ask* politely if he could share a prayer with your child, given that you send your kids to CATHOLIC SCHOOL. Even if you\u2019re atheists, I would think you\u2019re somewhat neutral/friendly towards prayer if you\u2019re paying thousands of dollars to go to Catholic school? And you called yourself a \u201ccloset reluctant atheist\u201d. \n\nI don\u2019t think it was overstepping for the sitter to simply ask because it\u2019s not like you set a clear, non \u201creluctant\u201d, non \u201ccloseted\u201d atheist boundary. \n\nHow hard is it to just say no? \n\nHe\u2019s not telling you your lack of belief is shit, so there was zero need to tell him his beliefs were. You say that this was to let him know it wasn\u2019t personal- but this is absolutely what MAKES it personal! \n\n YTA. \n\nMy Jewish husband still accepts blessings from Catholics even if he isn\u2019t one himself.

His prognosis is excellent because it was caught early and he's an excellent candidate for BMT and was quickly found a match. However the treatment has been brutal and it should go into maintenance by fall when starts the 3rd grade. \n\nUnfortunately he can't really play with other kids because his immune system is compromised. We're lucky that we have a sitter who can be a playmate and a caretaker who isn't a parent if me or his mom can't be there. Someone who knows how to dispense his meds, bathe him, follow dietitian guidelines and keeping him entertained.\n\nThe other day our sitter asked if it would be okay to pray with Owen. I was taken by surprise because in the few years that we've known him and worked for us, he's never mentioned religion. I thought he was Mormon because he has five brothers and his family look like they're from the 1950s.\n\nI'm a closet reluctant atheist and my wife is agnostic. Our kids go to a private Catholic school mainly because for its academics and extracurricular activities and it's mostly secular. If our kids want to follow a religion then that's up to them as adults. Our sitter knows this.\n\nI told him I'd rather have him take care of Owen. I believe prayer is bullshit like Bigfoot and no need to make Owen feel like a prayer is going to cure his cancer. That's false hope. I said he's free to pray for him, not with him.\n\nEver since then things have been awkward between us. I think I offended him in some way by declining a prayer.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You are dealing with a horrific situation- glad to hear his prognosis is good but a leukemia diagnosis & cancer treatment are traumatic for any child or family to go through- and your sitter knows your family\u2019s beliefs and boundaries. To me, your reaction sounds protective, stemming from outrage that this person you trust would put your child in a position to potentially experience even more stress and pain.\n\nIt sounds like your family is very likely dealing with trauma and grief around the losses related to your child\u2019s illness- being able to play with other children, pain, confronting death in elementary school, parents not being able to fix or protect from pain related tot be illness, and much more.

You and your family have been clear about your values and boundaries and the sitter, while well-intentioned I\u2019m sure, was way out of line. The sitter needs to let this go, as it was incredibly insensitive and inappropriate for him to ask in the first place.

I love that teacher", "Well being the subject of prayers is different than actually praying yourself. \n\nI sometimes pray. but being prayed for or over just gives me anxiety.", "Not what I was talking about.", "In the same paragraph, OP states \u201cOur sitter knows this\u201d. So no it wasn\u2019t appropriate.", "How was the sitter not rude? He brought up praying with the son, not for the son. And according to OP, the sitter knows the families views. \n\nAgain, the \u201cand from\u201d needs to be just as respected. I would never dream of walking up to someone who I knew was religious and saying \u201cwe only have one life, there is no after life, stop wasting your time praying, live your best life today, be kind, live and let live.\u201d If they have faith, and they find comfort, what harm does it do? \n\nAll I ask in return is they keep said faith to themselves. Belief does not trump non-belief in the aggregation of all things. To the individual it might, but I\u2019m an individual with the same rights, if \u201cfrom religion\u201d isn\u2019t respected then why should I respect \u201cof religion\u201d?", "It's not clear to me what, exactly the sitter knows. The paragraph reads:\n\n>I'm a closet reluctant atheist and my wife is agnostic. Our kids go to a private Catholic school mainly because for its academics and extracurricular activities and it's mostly secular. If our kids want to follow a religion then that's up to them as adults. Our sitter knows this.\n\nIs OP saying that the sitter knows *absolutely all* of that, including that OP is \"a closet reluctant atheist\" and his wife is agnostic? His description of himself as a \"*closet* atheist\" inspires some doubt. (I don't know about you, but I certainly never discussed faith with the parents of kids I babysat \u2013 in fact, I would have thought it wildly inappropriate if any of them had ever tried to broach the subject with me \u2013 and I seriously that doubt my friends with kids have ever had such a discussion with the babysitters they hire; I know my brother and SIL wouldn't do so.) The sitter almost certainly knows where the kids go to school, but I don't think we can assume he has comprehensive knowledge of the parents' beliefs. \n\nIn any event, he asked \u2013 not demanded; asked \u2013 just once, and apparently did so politely, but OP just *had to* be insulting in his response, which makes him an AH. If the babysitter hadn't bothered to ask, or if he'd been rude or demanding or dismissive, or if he kept bringing it up after being told no, he'd be an AH too, but he didn't do any of those things, so he's not one.", "Also according to OP, he sends his children to a private Catholic school. Most catholic schools incorporate prayer into the day, some even have students attend daily mass. I can see where the sitter would think it okay to *ask.* You\u2019re responding like the sitter just did it without saying anything.\n\nOP does have a right to freedom **from** religion, but sending his children to a religious school rather than a secular private school cast all of that into a grey area.", "That is literally you expecting the entire world and all its people to conform to your view and abide by it at all times in your presence", "Yeah, that was my reading. And like you said, he asked, which I don't find to be inappropriate. My guess is sitter just didn't think OP and OP's wife were \"super religious\" or Catholic, but might have some beliefs.", "That is funny! Really funny. Read that from an atheist/agnostic/humanist perspective.", "\u201cThat is literally you expecting the entire world and all its people to conform to your view and abide by it at all times in your presence\u201d.\n\nTake out the \u201cin your presence\u201d and you just described the Republican/Conservative Party of the US."]}
