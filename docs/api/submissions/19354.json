Covid hit during my 19-21 ages, 16-18 was completely normal and even WITH Covid, 19-21 was so much better than normal 16-18", "NTA\n\nThis is not a normal way to cope with disappointment in life. If your friend is so hung up on this that she wants to lie about her age, she needs some therapy.", "NTA - understand that if she hooks up with any of these boys, she's over the age of 18 and they're minors.  This is shaky ground.", "NTA - she wants you to come with you doesnt mean you have to lie for her.   and lets just hope lying about her age to hang with 16 year old guys stops before its a felony", "This is creepy, like reverse the genders and there would be cries for jail time.", "Your friend sounds like a real loser. Imagine if the genders were reversed and some creepy 19m and friend was hanging out with high schoolers.", "NTA - don\u2019t feel like an asshole because you accidentally told the truth. \n\nyour friend is weird.", "Your friend is weird as fuck, tbf her mental age seems 12-13. NTA", "Nta. My highschool was near a state college by a few city blocks and the kids would hang out in the college social areas just to pick up college students and vice-versa. She's not doing herself any favors lying about her age. Honestly, she didn't miss much outside of prom. I was 19 and attended 2 proms with geeky friends. There was no hanky panky, but sure was fun hanging out.", "NTA. Your friend needs therapy and honestly, the whole lying about her age to hook younger guys is really gross, predatory, and possibly illegal depending on age and where you're located. \n\nShe's acting like a creep and needs help. Missing out cos of COVID is weak reasoning. This is dumb and weird behaviour.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not your responsibility to lie for her. And she\u2019s being creepy for lying about her age and going for younger guys. Would she think it was ok if a 19 yr old guy was doing this??", "NTA but your friend absolutely is.\n\nBottom line, while it's 'only' two years, a 19 year old adult is lying about her age to hang out and party with teenage boys. That's a disaster waiting to happen.", "God I wish I was young enough to think any of this mattered.\n\nThose were the days.", "Oosh, 19 is literally PEAK YOUTH!!! Tell her to stop being silly and have an outrageously fun time being 19.", "Nta. Your friend is sick & twisted. This is so wrong on so many levels. And i certainly hope she isnt dating younger. Not only do boys seem to mature slower, they tend to lie (so do girls) & add a yr or 2. Not much diff than her. Except shes an adult pretending to be a child. What part abt that seems ok, healthy or normal?! \n What line is ok to cross for her & which isn't ? What happens when she crosses the line (even by accident) w a 15 yr old? You couldn't pay me to w her. If there is alcohol, the oldest person there is the one in the most trouble. And instead of being embarrassed or ashamed when she was busted, its your fault??? Get a new friend", "These poor covid kids. I really feel for young people who missed out on these big chunks of development. NAH, it is understandably confusing for you but also tough for her.", "NTA.  If the genders were reversed, most people would see the red flags all over this form of manipulation.", "Um,most people consider 16-about 20 to be the *same* age group. What the hell does she think she missed exactly? If anything,life gets slightly (or sometimes greatly) better after you get high school out of the way and head to college. She\u2019s pursuing a Narnia that doesn\u2019t exist and if she keeps getting found out she could really screw up the early adulthood she\u2019s living in right now. If I were you I would not go with her again and,if anything,try to find something \u2018uni-age\u2019 for the two of you. \nGeez,I hope she continues with the therapy.", "NTA.\n\nWe have a term for people who lie about their ages so they can hang out with minors.  What was it again?  The term we'd all be instantly and openly applying if you were asking about a man doing this.  Pedometer?  Pedagogy?  Pediatrician?  I can't quite remember it off hand.", "NTA. She could get in trouble for hanging out with and flirting with underage teens", "NTA - if she was a guy going to high school parties to get attention from high school girls people would be calling her a creep.", "She's creepy and weird.  She's bad news.  It is not normal to lie about things for this sort of reason.  She will get you in trouble if you continue to hang with her.", "YTA\n\nNot for slipping, but for backtracking and helping her prey on children.  This is about an inch away from her declaring the 16 year old boy as her boyfriend who goes to another school.  Do your friend and those kids a favor and shut this down before she does something illegal.", "NTA-\n\nShe is bored like a creep. What the heck? \n\nShe is 19 not in her late 20s. In college you experience it all\u2026 no?", "NTA. How old are the boys that she engages with? Because she sounds like a sexual predator.", "NTA - where I'm from 18 is the adult/minor age that can lead to actual legal charges depending on any sexual activity - even just texting photos, etc...  Better to be truthful.", "NTA You need to let your friend know that you're not going to lie to support her fantasies. If she wants to continue with this then she'll need to do without you. That you're not ashamed of who you are and neither should she be.", "Everyone missed out on years of their life. It\u2019s no excuse to hang out with people younger than her and then lie about her age. How long is she going to keep this up? Well into her 20? Or until she looks too old to pass as 17. \n\nShe is spending too much time mourning the years that she lost that she is loosing more years of her life. And will continue to look back and think that she wasted hears of her life.", "NTA That\u2019s what she loves about these high school boys, she gets older, they stay the same age.", "NTA. I was a senior who didn\u2019t get prom or senior trip because of covid. I\u2019m still a little upset about it, but I didn\u2019t go around and latch on to the younger class friends I had nor try to make new ones so I could potentially have that experience. Sometimes we miss out on those things and it\u2019s okay. She needs to grow up. It\u2019s wrong she\u2019s lying to these people about her age. She\u2019s making a mountain out of molehill.", "NTA. She can't make you hold your adult social life hostage because she wants to pretend to be younger. It sounds like she needs to continue her glow up and go back to therapy.", "NTA. How crazy that most people her age are lying to be 21, not 16 lol.\n\nAlso everyone missed out on a year or two - everyone can relate to that. Make experiences at your current age because otherwise she'll always be playing catch up.", "At 19 your life is basically over so it doesn\u2019t matter", "nta", "Creepy AF.", "Can you imagine if a guy did this and was seeking the attention of younger girls? It's very creepy. I'm not one to recommend therapy often but this girl either needs therapy or get a job where she can be down with the kids (a camp of some sort).", "You mean when she statutory rapes underage teenagers?", " The only thing wrong with any of this is the lying.", "Preying on minors\u2026 she\u2019s 19. She\u2019s basically a minor ffs. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s going after 15 yos they\u2019re literally a year younger you guys sound stupid", "I think lying about your age to get laid is an asshole move, even if it would be totally fine for them to get together otherwise. Being truthful with your sexual partners is important, even when it\u2019s a trivial issue.", "So, you're saying a 19-year-old man lying about his age to hang out with high school girls would be perfectly OK?  NAH as well, right?", "Depends where they're from. OP said in another comment that the ages they are at makes it legal, lying about age makes it super creepy though", "Usually the parties have people 16-19 but she goes for 17/18.", "Nta. What your friend's doing is creepy and weird.", "[removed]", "Yeah, I don't know anyone who was in college who wished that they were still in high school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis sends up marinara-colored flares that she needs therapy.", "Looks like he needs to continue his brilliance and go back to therapy.", "All it takes is one 15 year old to lie about his age to get with a 17 year old girl...", "The ages aren\u2019t weird, it\u2019s the lying about it to me. It doesn\u2019t even serve a purpose. Why can\u2019t she hang out with 18 year olds at age 19?! And what does she think is so very different about it? \n\nI went to similar parties at 17 and 19, only difference was I could also get into clubs at 19 to meet more people.", "Legal and ethical are often two different things. Your friend is engaging in predatory behavior.", "So.....she likes having sex w/ immature kids? \n\nYeah, she should work on that....NTA.", "Your friend's behavior is creepy and predatory. Do not participate, and inform people of her actual age when given the opportunity.", "NTA.Pretending to be 2 years younger isn\u2019t actually going to make her 2 years younger.", "A 19-year-old man could still reasonably be in high school so the age literally doesn\u2019t fucking matter when everyone involved is still 17/18/19. The only thing wrong with any of this is the lying.", "You should not have to cover for her at all this lie is insane. NTA", "[removed]", "10/10", "OP said in another comment that it is legal where they are. Where I'm from the age of consent is 16, so they might be from a country with an age lower than 18", "They\u2019re not talking about legality but ethics. Lying about your age to engage in sex (which is presumably where this male attention is supposed to lead) that\u2019s predatory. I\u2019d argue lying for any reason to get something you want that a person may not have given you otherwise is predatory behavior.", "IT's not the age, it's the lying for me.  If she was honest and they met in an honest way (at work etc) it wouldn't be creepy.  It's that she is specifically looking to meet younger people and is lying about her age that makes her a creep.", "Ofc you are tolerant because she is a woman, but think on how a guy lying about his age to meet minors would be treated here.", "She goes for 17 to 18 year olds and lies to them about her age...", "What\u2019s with teenagers these days being so ridiculously puritanical? Someone who is 17 and someone who is 19 are basically exactly the same. It\u2019s not an age gap and it\u2019s not creepy at all.", "I\u2019d say the lying is a bigger issue than the age gap. The legal age is an arbitrary line. I\u2019d usually argue the arbitrarity if it is argument to date older. Being equidistant from the generally accepted age for adults to start engaging in sex is fine. 19 years olds dating 17 year olds can happen organically in high school and it\u2019s really not a social problem. However, once you start lying you get into territory where people are consenting when they otherwise not might be. That is an issue.", "English so this is with context that 16 is our age of consent - the guy I gave my virginity to was 18...I'm sure some people are retching and sickened\n\nBUT he was my friends big brothers friend, so I spent a hell of a lot of time around him and it was a lot of mutual interests and such. \n\nSo I'm fine with it, he was a nice, sweet, genuine guy and there wasn't any predatory red flags (after me and him he's gone on to date many women, some younger, some older. But there's never been an indication of any wrongdoing)\n\nIF he'd ever lied about his age I'd have felt violated and gross. But he was upfront straight away, hell me and my friend were actually at his 18th birthday bash (me cos I had a teeny crush, friend because 18 year olds can buy alcohol and cigs)", "[removed]", "I don't understand your friend.", "Is it a bit odd? Yeah. Is it illegal? Absolutely not. Is she actually harming anyone at all by doing it? Only herself because people will think she\u2019s weird for lying for no reason. This isn\u2019t the crime of the century.", "and again i\u2019m saying that it\u2019s weird. i assume you\u2019re older and that\u2019s why you classify all teenagers in the same category but the maturity difference is there and IMO (you obviously disagree which i\u2019m not here to argue) it\u2019s weird", "why aren\u2019t you listening to teenagers when we\u2019re saying we aren\u2019t the same? if you\u2019re not a teenager or in the same age group then you wouldn\u2019t know and it makes sense on why you group them the same.", "no i agree that the lying is much worse than the age gap (there\u2019s  definitely worse) and if they got together in high school and continued their relationship after one graduated, that\u2019s fine too. but imo being 19 i would never want to date a 17 year old", "And I get that, its just my opinion, even if the age of consent is 16, and its not about the dating part, we all know that its not going to be just  dating. That\u2019s why I was very clear to say having a sexual relationship, if it was just dating I wouldn\u2019t say anything about this situation but we all know its not going to be just dating and that\u2019s why I think people should give them a little more time.", "It's creepy and wrong to lie to others so you can date them, specially if they are minors.\n\nA 19 yo man would be crucified for pulling the same stunt.", "The maturity difference is NOT there. This entire discussion is about a 19 year old pretending to be 17. Does that sound like a mature thing to do?\n\nSome 17 year olds are very mature. Some 19 year olds are very immature. It's just absurd to make blanket statements that there must be a large maturity gap.", "Because you sound socially inept. I'm 22 and when I was your age (not that long ago), nobody acted like this.\n\nDid covid really screw up people's brains this badly?", "That\u2019s fair and I understand why you wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m 31 and have a different perspective and the difference between you and a 17 year old isn\u2019t huge. There are likely 17 year olds in the world more mature than you and there are definitely 19 year olds less mature than some 17 year olds and that maturity is what we\u2019re trying to achieve when we put an age minimum for these things. Laws are in place to protect minors from people my age not people your age.\n\nBut you\u2019re not wrong either. At your age the difference in a year feels huge because you just spent twelve years in a system that functionally segregates you by year of birth so I get why minor age differences feel big at your age.", "okay so you obviously missed where i said in my opinion. \n\nand that doesn\u2019t sound like they lack maturity, they sound deranged.\n\nEdit: by your logic, isn\u2019t it also wrong to have a blank statement to say that the \u201cmaturity difference is not there\u201d", "you\u2019re rude", "yes you\u2019re definitely right about laws being more for people your age rather than mine!\n\nand yes that was exactly my point. a lot of people seem to disagree through lol"]}
