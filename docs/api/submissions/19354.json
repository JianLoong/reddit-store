Is she going to be 21 still hanging out with and trying to date high schoolers?", "YTA - You're the Asshole. It seems like you intentionally exposed your friend's real age in front of others, knowing that she was trying to present herself as younger. While it may have been awkward for you in the moment, publicly contradicting her age without discussing it with her beforehand was not a considerate action. It's important to respect your friend's wishes and support her in her desire to relive certain experiences. If you had concerns or felt uncomfortable, a private conversation with her would have been more appropriate. Communication and understanding are key in maintaining a healthy friendship.", "NTA- your legally adult friend needs to grow up and stop preying on minors while pretending to still be one... it's..just weird, man.

If your friend wants you to tell a harmless lie, then she needs to tell you about it so you can be her hype girl. Sometimes we have to meet people where they are, even if we don\u2019t agree.", "NTA but also its creepy for her to lie about her age in order to get attention from not yet adults.", "NTA\n\nYour friend didnt miss out on this age. Your entire school year did. Unfortunately a lot of people missed 2 years of their life. Most arent pretending it didnt happen though. This is very strange behaviour from your friend honestly.\n\nIts hard to keep up a lie and you failed. Doesnt make you an AH makes you a good person IMO.", "NTA \n\nPretending to be 2 years younger isn\u2019t actually going to make her 2 years younger. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to lie.", "NTA\n\nRead your post in relationship advice, too.  \n\nYou're fine.  She's the one lying.  She can't just expect you to keep up her lies.  \n\nShe's clearly going through something, but what she's doing is not helping her situation.  If she's lying to people, she's going to get found out eventually.  \n\nShe's not going to see it that way because she's too wrapped up in her delusions.  She's only causing more harm though because she's lying to these people and when found out, they're not going to keep her around.  If you can convince her that this isn't going to fix the way she feels, go for it.  She needs therapy to get through it, not pretending to be 2 years younger.", "NTA. She can lie about herself all she wants, but she shouldn't be expecting you to lie for her too.", "NAH. I think most people at the party would be cool with knowing that an older teen wants to hang with them. But you don't need to lie for her, and she needs to accept her real age.", "NTA\n\nYes, covid did a number on peoples social lives. It also did much, much worse to entirely too many people.\n\nShe's bummed out that she missed out on some parts of \"growing up.\" I can empathise with that.\n\nLying about her age in order to hang out with younger people; specifically younger guys whose attention she seems to covet, is another thing entirely.\n\nHer behaviour is creepy, and I  would not want to be around a person who chooses to behave in such a manner.", "nah dude switch genders - a dude pretending to be 17 to date young girls is super predatory and creepy and bad. just like it is here. OP is NTA", "Fair enough. I definitely see the point youre making!\n\nBUT It's definitely an odd situation to be in and the first time I had to cover for her. Especially being put on the spot like that didn't feel good.", "Preying on minors is a bit harsh. \n\nBeing 19 hanging out with 17 year olds is honestly pretty normal. Growing up my friends that graduated before me still had me around for parties and hanging out and stuff. \n\nHer friend needs to get over the regret of hating who she was though", "Haha fair enough! Id definitely intervene if she stepped into the illegal territory but the whole situation is so bizarre to me I don't know what to make of it.", "Yeah she goes mostly for guys 17-18 which *is* legal over here at least but odd nonetheless .", ">Unfortunately a lot of people missed 2 years of their life\n\nRight it is really unfortunate. I wish she'd realise everyone went through the same thing so there's not much that was 'missed out' on really :/", "That's exactly what I told her!", "In which sentence did she mention that she \"pretended to be younger to date younger guys\". It's OP's observation that she was craving younger guys attention and while that might sound creepy, even if so its only a 2 years age gap, being 19 and flirting with 17-18 years old, even being a guy, isn't that creepy imo since most girls in that age want older guys anyways.", "You\u2019re right, it is! Hopefully it\u2019s something you can both look back and laugh at one day. My friends and I are always laughing about the funny, weird and/ stupid things we did at uni or after uni or now\u2026 haha.", ">younger guys' attention seems to be what she's craving."]}
