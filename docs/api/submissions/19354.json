It seems like you intentionally exposed your friend's real age in front of others, knowing that she was trying to present herself as younger. While it may have been awkward for you in the moment, publicly contradicting her age without discussing it with her beforehand was not a considerate action. It's important to respect your friend's wishes and support her in her desire to relive certain experiences. If you had concerns or felt uncomfortable, a private conversation with her would have been more appropriate. Communication and understanding are key in maintaining a healthy friendship.", "NTA- your legally adult friend needs to grow up and stop preying on minors while pretending to still be one... it's..just weird, man.

If your friend wants you to tell a harmless lie, then she needs to tell you about it so you can be her hype girl. Sometimes we have to meet people where they are, even if we don\u2019t agree.", "NTA but also its creepy for her to lie about her age in order to get attention from not yet adults.", "NTA\n\nYour friend didnt miss out on this age. Your entire school year did. Unfortunately a lot of people missed 2 years of their life. Most arent pretending it didnt happen though. This is very strange behaviour from your friend honestly.\n\nIts hard to keep up a lie and you failed. Doesnt make you an AH makes you a good person IMO.", "NTA \n\nPretending to be 2 years younger isn\u2019t actually going to make her 2 years younger. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to lie.", "NTA\n\nRead your post in relationship advice, too.  \n\nYou're fine.  She's the one lying.  She can't just expect you to keep up her lies.  \n\nShe's clearly going through something, but what she's doing is not helping her situation.  If she's lying to people, she's going to get found out eventually.  \n\nShe's not going to see it that way because she's too wrapped up in her delusions.  She's only causing more harm though because she's lying to these people and when found out, they're not going to keep her around.  If you can convince her that this isn't going to fix the way she feels, go for it.  She needs therapy to get through it, not pretending to be 2 years younger.", "NTA. She can lie about herself all she wants, but she shouldn't be expecting you to lie for her too.", "NAH. I think most people at the party would be cool with knowing that an older teen wants to hang with them. But you don't need to lie for her, and she needs to accept her real age.", "NTA\n\nYes, covid did a number on peoples social lives. It also did much, much worse to entirely too many people.\n\nShe's bummed out that she missed out on some parts of \"growing up.\" I can empathise with that.\n\nLying about her age in order to hang out with younger people; specifically younger guys whose attention she seems to covet, is another thing entirely.\n\nHer behaviour is creepy, and I  would not want to be around a person who chooses to behave in such a manner.", "nah dude switch genders - a dude pretending to be 17 to date young girls is super predatory and creepy and bad. just like it is here. OP is NTA", "Fair enough. I definitely see the point youre making!\n\nBUT It's definitely an odd situation to be in and the first time I had to cover for her. Especially being put on the spot like that didn't feel good.", "Preying on minors is a bit harsh. \n\nBeing 19 hanging out with 17 year olds is honestly pretty normal. Growing up my friends that graduated before me still had me around for parties and hanging out and stuff. \n\nHer friend needs to get over the regret of hating who she was though", "Haha fair enough! Id definitely intervene if she stepped into the illegal territory but the whole situation is so bizarre to me I don't know what to make of it.", "Yeah she goes mostly for guys 17-18 which *is* legal over here at least but odd nonetheless .", ">Unfortunately a lot of people missed 2 years of their life\n\nRight it is really unfortunate. I wish she'd realise everyone went through the same thing so there's not much that was 'missed out' on really :/", "That's exactly what I told her!", "In which sentence did she mention that she \"pretended to be younger to date younger guys\". It's OP's observation that she was craving younger guys attention and while that might sound creepy, even if so its only a 2 years age gap, being 19 and flirting with 17-18 years old, even being a guy, isn't that creepy imo since most girls in that age want older guys anyways.", "You\u2019re right, it is! Hopefully it\u2019s something you can both look back and laugh at one day.

Your friend is a predator. Flip it: \u2018my male friend who\u2019s 19 likes to pretend to be 17, and goes to parties to talk to 17yr old girls\u2019? How does that sound? Ur friend is gross, and you should not be forced to partake in her predatory (and disgusting) behavior", "NTA: if she spends her 19th and 20th year making up for the last two years she\u2019ll always be behind. She\u2019ll miss being 19 and 20. And then so on and so forth. She needs to move in from the past. Everyone missed out on two years but you don\u2019t see them praying on high schoolers.", "NTA that's creepy of her", "NTA. Is she going to get these 2 years back by lying? Nope. Does she need therapy or something? Yeap.", "No NTA. So you didn't lie for her.", "NTA. They\u2019re dragging into a situation that could end badly. This sound more like a mental health issue than anything to do with lock-down or COVID. Everyone had to deal with that. But imagine if everyone decided they wanted to \u2018make up for the time lost by pushing back their chronological age\u2019? She was already in therapy but clearly should continue on until she gets closer to understanding why she needs to lie about something like her age.", "NTA \n\nshe decided to act like she was younger then she actually is. She didnt tell anyone she met about it. She probably didn't think of the consequences that would come if they found out. \n\nI dont feel like you should feel bad because you just told them what was real. \nShe can act like she's 17 while still telling people her real age", "NTA. You should not have to lie for her \n\nShe is lying about her age and craving the attention of younger guys? Sounds like a creep.", "Also stupid. If she\u2019s worried she \u2018missed out\u2019 on being 17 and spends her 19th year making up for it, she\u2019s just missed out on being 19.

It reads like she is a creep", "I should add: Its normal to be friends with 17-18 yr olds when your 19, but to lie that your 17 when you are an adult and party with 17 year olds because u \u2018crave the attention of younger men\u2019 is predatory, and weird!", "If they would, she should tell them. She doesn't, because she knows they'd be weirded out. \n\nOP is NTA but the friend has issues.", "It's creepy and weird and wrong. I hope your friend gets help. Otherwise I fear a BORU post 10 years from now where she's either still pulling her 17 y/o trick but it's beyond wearing thin, or she gets brought up on assault charges. \n\nGiven the relative maturation speeds of male vs. female brains, her dating younger has such an ickiness to it, regardless of theoretical legality. \n\nDoes she have any other bananapants tendencies?", ">Preying on minors is a bit harsh. \n\nI disagree. That is what she is doing. \n\nIf a 17yo boy was lying to a 19 yo woman to attract her I'd consider that \"preying\" on someone, also. It doesn't matter what gender or what age they are, they are lying about their age in order to attract people. I see that as predatory. Hopefully, she isn't into preying on much *younger* minors, too...but she is preying on minors, nonetheless.", "If the genders were reversed, everyone would be calling her a creep. Rightfully so. A 19 year old guy trying to get with 17 years old girls is gross. This isn't any different.\n\nEdited to point out, that hanging out with the friends you made in high school is way different than trying to score with teenagers. In your case it was probably more innocent, and no one had to lie about their ages because everyone already knew.", "darkyoda, I'm super lacking understanding    \n How long would you last in a Zombie apocalypse?", "I doubt the kids would be weirded out. 19 means older friends (chance to meet new college girls), driving, no curfew, and 3 years closer to buying beer. I AM NOT condoning it. Just thinking that a kid would enjoy it. \n\nI think it's all in the friend's head.", "Lying about her age is pretty small in the grand scheme of things but not ideal - and you really think it\u2019s weird she\u2019s going for people in that same sort of age range? Seems very puritanical and very judgemental. Most people I know would date within that range back when I was that age. It\u2019s not like 15 and 30.\n\nEdit: She\u2019s 19 and goes for 17-18 year olds. Stop trying to make out that this age range is weird. It isn\u2019t.", ">If the genders were reversed, everyone would be calling her a creep. Rightfully so.

And that's what's happening. It's not some cool older person bringing neat things to the group vibe, it's someone who thinks they have to lie to get in. Regardless of whether they'd be open if she came openly from the start, she's made creepy choices that indicate her thinking is creepy. \n\nThe friend has issues, and chose lying to fix them. Oddly it's not working.", "It's absolutely weird and creepy because if genders were reversed people would be throwing a fit.", "I wouldn't have a problem (well, not a huge one) if she  was  doing this openly. She's explicitly lying to them because she wants something specific, and doesn't think she can get it honestly. \n\nI'm against lying to people to  get what you want, unless we're lying to abusers for our  own safety or something like that. \n\nLying to get people to behave the way you want is creepy. Lying to get folks who are younger than you  to behave how you want is fucked.", "Yes. I think it\u2019s weird when the people within that age range meet while they\u2019re in different stages of life (university vs. high school/secondary school) and the older person is intentionally concealing their real age. Particularly because, as in this case, the older person will likely have to lie about a lot more to maintain the lie about their age, like where they go to school, where they live, etc. \n\nIf the friend was honest about her age and had a preexisting relationship with these younger people that stemmed from school, it\u2019d be a lot less creepy but a university student really should have other priorities than seeking out high school kids to hang out with.", "as someone who was 19 literally a day ago, yes it is. Especially when you lie about being 17", "It's completely normal for 17 year olds to date 19 year olds. That's not a creepy age gap", "I don't think a 19 yo and a 17 yo are weird regardless of the genders, but it's not okay for a 19 of any gender to pretend to be 17 to pick up 17 yos.", "would people really freak out about a 19yo boy dating a 17yo girl?

It\u2019s just a couple of years. And, as OP said it\u2019s perfectly legal where they are - and also where I\u2019m from too. I just think it\u2019s a bit of a stretch to say there\u2019s anything wrong with dating someone in this age range.", "It\u2019s a couple of years and they\u2019re teens. When I was 16 I\u2019d lie to older girls in order to chat them up. I think a lot of people here are forgetting what it\u2019s like to be young and immature. Not everything is abuse.", "She\u2019s 19 and goes for guys aged 17-18. Jesus wept. You people are mad.", "It's not normal to lie about your age to get attention from younger people.", "It's the fraud in order to date that's the issue.", "Because she's lying to do it. If he knew her age already, it wouldn't be bad.", "Aging yourself up to join older folks is very different than a legal adult lying to minors so they can hang out. \n\nYour apples do not compare to these oranges, but thanks for playing.", "Oh that's always wrong. But if she was going in admitting her age then i don't think her dating a guy 2 years younger would be an issue. Tbh it sounds less like she wants to date them and more that she wants that attention", "Please don\u2019t patronise me. I\u2019m just pointing out how close in ages they are and it\u2019s not a problem. Lying isn\u2019t great but they\u2019re that close in age I honestly don\u2019t see what\u2019s so creepy about it. It\u2019d be similar to lying about what car you have or how much money you have in order to curry favour. It\u2019s not right but hardly the end of the world.", "She's lying to  minors to get what she wants from them. I'd have far fewer qualms if she  wasn't doing so. It would still be a choice  I would side eye  a bit, but it wouldn't necessarily be red flag central. It is here, for me. Regardless of whether or not she  wants to date them. \n\nThis is a violation of the consent of the lied-to, to get them to act in ways  she wants without their ability to consent in a fully-informed way. Lack of consent matters, regardless of sexual context or the lack  thereof. \n\nIf you lie to people to get them to  do  what  you  want, you're a creep. Even if it would actually not be necessary, if she talked to them, she THINKS it's necessary and she's fine with doing it."]}
