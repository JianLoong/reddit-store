Real but understated.", "No, most people I know IRL would be very focused on the 'lying about her age to attract younger people' part as predatory. I find that predatory regardless of the target.", "The Oprhan is about a woman in her 30s pretending to be a minor. It's trippy and creepy.", "Oh no, absolutely agree with you there. It's a scummy thing to do, but as long as they are both within the age of consent I don't think it could be considered predatory", "Age of CONSENT. if they aren't CONSENTING to be with a legal ADULT, then it cam potentially be statutory rape.", "Nope. 16 is the age of consent - but with other 16/17 year olds. Under 18 and you're still a minor, so an 18+ year old with an under-18 is legally an adult having sex with a minor. This can get pretty sticky legally for the adult if the relationship goes wrong or the minor's parents aren't impressed.", "It's still an adult having sex with a minor,  even though the age of consent is technically 16.", "Bot stole this from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1451s4j/comment/jnjko1a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).", "Age of consent doesn't mean shit when you get into deceitful or predatory behavior. And age of consent is irrelevant in power dynamics which is what applies to statutory rape.", "yeah but lying to them and telling them you are 17 seems a bit sus ngl", "Do you think I just magically poofed into existence as an adult? I was a teenager too. Your responses here are just demonstrating your lack of maturity and life experience, and it\u2019s just confirming that you\u2019re still at the exact same level as a 17/18/19 year-old.", "We have some degree of Romeo and Juliet laws. Technically the relationship started when he was 17...\n\nLegally its all clear. \n\nAlso the odds of CPS pursuing an 18 year old for having consensual sex with a 16 year old isn't a great look when they're completely failing to prosecute actual nonces and rapists", "Oh good lord. You may as well say \u201cif it was illegal to have sex with a 16 year old, this would be illegal.\u201d Some of you lot really are hard of thinking.", "you think i lack maturity because i think i\u2019m too mature to date a high schooler? i\u2019m not sure what to say to that honestly \n\ni think you\u2019re purposely being obtuse. obviously you didn\u2019t just come into existence as an adult, but depending your age maybe it was probably more socially acceptable. you even say \u201cteenagers these days\u201d meaning you acknowledge that teenagers are different from when you were.", "I\u2019m English too. There are no Romeo and Juliet laws here at all. There are rules regarding underage sexting/pornography however. So it\u2019s perfectly legal for anyone over the age of 16 to have sex with anyone else over the age of 16. What you can\u2019t do is send pictures/videos/sexual communications to each other until both are over 18.", "Romeo and Juliet can protect you but I think it could still be statutory rape under certain estates laws (im not from the US, i'm just spouting what I remember from. that hilarious Xray fact in the Romeo and Juliet scene of transformers 4)", "Doesn't need to be illegal to be creepy or immoral."]}
