Would your husband have handed over a work iPad full of confidential materials? One would hope not. Car rides existed long before mobile electronics. Everyone would have survived just fine without the introduction of the iPad. The fact that he has continued to give your son the iPad against your explicit instructions shows that he is disrespectful and dismissive of your feelings and concerns. That means he can no longer be trusted with your nudes. Personally? I would delete them from every device and refuse to give him any more until he gave me a sincere apology and showed prolonged, consistent improvement in his behavior toward me.

Kids who are exposed to technology young can navigate it incredibly intuitively, and kids are naturally curious. He definitely would have found the photos eventually. Better to remove them now.", "And the 4 year old from potentially developing some really weird shit later in life. That age is so impressionable and should never have access to material like that, let alone of their MOTHER.", "Legally where?\n\nI'm sure that is true in some jurisdictions in some countries, but one can't just say \"legally, this\" when not knowing what country, state, jurisdiction they're in.", "lol EAH is not a judgement and OP actually DID speak to the husband before deleting\n\nalso\n\nwhy does she have to ask her husband? they were pictures of her, not of him.", "It doesn\u2019t really matter what he says to be completely honest, she is the ONLY one to gets to decide whether or not NUDE pictures of HER are stored on a device, no one else gets to have a decision in that, husband and wife or not. No one ever has a decision of what to do with someone elses nudes no matter who you are to that person", "sorry, i meant crime and it is in my country (ireland).", "Actually, in most if not all US states, clothing is considered \"marital property,\" i.e. legally owned by both parties.
