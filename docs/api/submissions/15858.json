This weekend is a very big festival and a few of the big acts are staying here. \n\nI'm apart of the group services dept and we typically handle all issues for the VIPs before they come through the door. We knew going into this that this one particular person and his wife were a bit of a pain, since we get their files from all the other hotels. But I feel like they took it a step too far. \n\nThis person is well known by millions of people. Their music can almost be quoted by everybody BUT they, themselves, are not someone you'd run across the street if you saw them. They blend in very easily.\n\nThey asked for private security. We gave it to them. They asked to be brought in through a private sector of the hotel to avoid \"people looking for photos or autographs\". Even his MANAGER who has been with him since the beginning even laughed saying that was a stretch. But we did it anyway. \n\nWe had maintenance comb over their room (which we upgraded to a 2 bedroom for free) to make sure that everything was working perfectly so no one would bother them during their stay. \n\nWhen they arrived, they immediately gave everyone a hard time. Coming late. Playing on their phones while our security made everyone clear the hallway to give them room and took their time slowly walking through a major hallway for the workers. \n\nWhen they got to their room, we were there waiting to greet them with treats and champagne and other goodies along with all of their luggage being separated and everything put exactly as they wanted. I was smiling from ear to ear because I knew I'd get praise for this and did a damn good job orchestrating it all. Especially because this was my first time doing it alone.\n\nTo make an already long winded story shorter. The wife complained about the treats that we provided. Everything was \"cheap\". And they hinted at wanting a better bottle of champagne/liqour. I said in the most professional way possible, that we've already gone above and beyond to make sure their room was already massively above budget for what we'd give to anybody but went above just because of who they were and wanted to give a nice welcome present. \n\nStill not good enough.\n\nThey almost demanded we bring them the best bottle we had. And I'm almost positive the words \"do you know who we are\" almost slipped from the wife's mouth but I can't say that as it didn't get any further than \"Do you kn....\" before she stopped and shook her head and looked down. The husband basically waved me away and my boss gave me the \"I'm disappointed\" face and won't directly answer if he's upset with me. \n\nBut I feel like we are already a 5 star hotel and treat every guest as such plus already went over and above for this guest. But now I feel like because of their status I should have gone even further to ensure they had the greatest time and would come back which brings more money.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1682621278, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1311zjc/aita_for_not_going_overboard_for_a_celebrity/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You've done nothing morally wrong but it's possible your manager might have qualms and some retraining. \n\nWorking for VIPS like that you kinda just have to get over whether their requests make sense.

You are on the wrong msg board. You are on here looking for someone to tell you \u201cgood job!\u201d No one can say YTA. You did your job. You said it yourself.

I don't think it's too much to ask that someone make sure nobody broke into their space, avoid others that might be pretending to just want a selfie with the artist and so on.   \n\nDid you hear what happened to Sandra Bullock?

Now your mocking and criticizing them, for their tastes.     \n\nHad they known that you were going to feel really put out, they would have just gone somewhere where the staff would have been happy to have the business.

There are some jobs where, even if it's a bummer, well that's the job. So I guess, what would your manager have done?", "You're absolutely right. I did mention, in so many words, they could pay for the new bottle but I probably could have been much more elegant about it.", "I forgot I wasn\u2019t reading a celebrity gossip group and wondered why no one was trying to solve this blind.\n\nI wonder if OP\u2019s employer had a rider, and what was outlined in it.", "Everyone knows their music, but nobody would recognize them: Max Martin?", "This weekend is Stagecoach. My guess is Bryan Adams. No idea if he's cool or not but he does have recognizable songs", "I can't speak for everywhere but here they end up spending ALOT of money. So we typically give them things for free because the better time they have the more likely they are to return and bring/tell friends. The best example of that is 4 years ago we had someone stay with us and we did something similar for them. They just booked their wedding with us and with the guests that have already confirmed, we will have well over 5 billion dollars in this hotel alone for a week. \n\nNot justifying, because sometimes it is outrageous, but just giving you our mindset.", "We have had situations where people have gotten fired for running up to their favorite actor/artist when they came and sneaking pictures. And we have had a few instances of word getting out so everyone waited outside for them. And we handle alot of sports teams so when they arrive we typically have alot of people waiting outside for the bus so I understand the added security to certain big names. But I can promise you had I not gotten their full file and was told what they did and then seeing them, I'd have never recognized this person.", "That is my plan when I return Monday. I can humbly say I'm very good at my job. But this did throw me as I'm not used to people being so unapologetically spoiled and kind of froze in the moment then started babbling to the best of my abilities. I still think I handled it far better than anybody else in my department would have, but this showed me I still have much to learn.", "Absolutely. I've had some wild ones. This one just threw me off", "That is why at least at my hotel, I try to go above an beyond for all guests. I can't do this exact same thing for everyone but if we meet even briefly in the hallway, I'm sending something to your room with a hand written note. I try to treat everyone the same.", "Funny enough. Had it been outlined in their pre arrival notes we probably would have gotten it.", "I left for the day. I'll find out more Monday. I'm never close to snapping at work because I always assume someone's having a bad day or stuff like that. But this was blatant and to feel like no one had my back kinda put a bad taste in my mouth.", "I also worked at a night club in the city and we had alot of them come through all the time. It was there I learned they typically prefer being treated like normal people. But there are the outliers.", "It is not lol", "I wanted some outside looking in on the subject. Like I said my boss seemed disappointed in me. I'm feeling alot better now and have calmed down from when I originally posted this. The guests were definitely TA but I definitely could have handled it differently. I was just so caught off guard by their demeanor and complete ungratefulness. However, this is the job I chose and I'm good at it. My mind just needs to be sharper to better handle these situations in the future.", "It absolutely goes with the territory. And that's why I love my job. I love being the person that has a hand in making sure your stay with us is as magical as it can be. The only issue I had is that they didn't necessarily expect this. Most VIPs give a \"rider\" that specifies what they'd like in their room before they arrive. And we always make sure that they're accommodated. This particular time, this was NOT expected or asked for. I just gave them a gift and they did not think the gift was good enough. That's where my annoyance came in.", "I do understand your side. I don't believe I mocked or criticized anyone, or at least that wasn't my intention.  I also didn't mind the security detail as we've given it to people of far less caliber. My only real complaint was that these were a gift. It wasn't outlined in their arrival notes otherwise we would have given them what they wanted. I went out of my way to give them something as a welcome gift and they basically said it wasn't good enough. However, I will take this in because you are outside looking in. I just want to be clear on my side.", "\"Omg babe, that weird fan who got my name tattooed to her forehead is back!\" \n\n\"Aww, I'm sorry sweetie. Hey, you know what'll make you feel better?\" \n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Bossing some servants around!\" \n\n\"Babe, you're a genius! Let's get free stuff and complain!!!!!!\"", "And I've heard horror stories but no one of the dozens I've met over the years are ever bad. Usually their complaints are justified and most times they don't even mention anything until they're leaving. This one definitely jolted me to reality.", "Yeah, it sounds like you were so taken aback by their reaction that your customer service mask slipped for a second. The curse of actually being a human being under that mask...", "So their rider was surprisingly vague. Most of the treats put in the room was what I picked from the amenities that most people really liked. I also didn't mention this bottle of champagne wasn't \"cheap\". It wasn't our most expensive but it is a favorite.", "Can confirm it is not lol", "5 billion in a week? That's $700,000,000 a day?", "That makes sense. Thanks for taking the time to explain. Cheers!\ud83d\ude01", "you just explained why YTA and should have given them even more.\n\nIf it drives profit to the hotel, you should have done it.", "Question:  what do you think your manager's reaction will be if he discovers you've posted this on social media?  There is an expectation of privacy as a hotel guest, celebrity or not.", "Hats off to you, really. I couldn't do what you do.", "I've heard that most of the time its usually the managers or assistants who cause the problems rather then the actual celeb.  (I live in Sin City, have coworkers who worked the big hotels and had to deal with these people).", "I can\u2019t remember if I voted, but based on this, definitely N TA. They should have specified exactly what they wanted if it was so important.", "Veuve?", "Lol just to confirm. The people that will be in here will have a combined net worth of over 5 billion staying with us for a week lol", "Most guests give us a list of things they \"like\" so we can have it ready for them when they arrive. I gave them a \"gift\" and that was not good enough  lots of other people got the same bottle, celebrities included, and they've all been grateful or didn't touch it. Had I known I would have. But I literally just gave them a gift and they thought I should do better. Just to be clear.", "Correct! Which is why I made sure not to mention the company, city, or state. My name or the celebs name. I've kept to just the story to protect the privacy of everyone.", "Can confirm I've had actual A listers put their HAND ON THE ASSISTANTS SHOULDER and told him to relax. He didn't ACTUALLY need all of that fancy water for a one night stay.", "Even here it seems it was the wife complaining, not the actual celeb.", "That's the usual. But Monday we got a huge shipment of Ace so I snagged one for the room. Like I said, above and beyond lol", "Oh, I misunderstood. I thought you meant that that the hotel would be making over 5 billion in the week. My mistake and my apology.", "He was the one who hinted at us bringing something better. Rolled his eyes alot. He definitely wasn't happy with me.", "Lol they didn't like the Ace? Dang. Bougie to the max.\n\nEdit: Ten bucks they would have thought Veuve was better because it's seems fancier.", "Oh okay I thought you were being funny and can see now I wasn't clear lol sorry, yes some tip top executives and ceos and owners will be joining us for this wedding and there will be alot of deep pockets walking around.", "Ugh. I'm sorry. Having to deal with people like that must suck. Don't let them ruin your weekend!", "Yeah, I can believe it. What you said was perfectly reasonable...what I *misunderstood* you to mean sounded somewhat far-fetched."]}
