You have to sit down with her now and again closer to important days like bdays and say \u201cthis is what i expect from you on these days for me to feel loved.\u201d Even if you didnt mean to, you hurt her feelings out of a reaction to your feeling being hurt in the past. You went out of your way to ignore her, as a reaction to what you previously felt on your own birthday. You gotta have the hard conversations or you will fester in unmet expectations.", "YTA.
