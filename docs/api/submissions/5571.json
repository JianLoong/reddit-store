Like you said, the problem has always been about the son and not the parents.

They are responsible for their own actions. You are not responsible for them. There are consequences to what they did and regardless of what is happening you should pursue legal action.  It is really unfortunate that it will happen this way, but the other thing is you are entitled to this money after years of torment. The fact that you were able to get a PRO says this.

I wouldn't want to go for fees either in this situation, but they forced you to spend this money unnecessarily. If they had just accepted the restraining, which it sounds like they should have, none of this would be happening. \n\nThe other thing you have to consider is that their son has been harassing people for years, and presumably the parents have tried thwart any serious attempt to stop him. Maybe this is the wake up call they need. Hard to say. You could also talk to your lawyer about not going after the full attorney's fees. If you have some room in your budget and not a lot of room in your conscience, you could could cover some portion of the attorney's fees.

Getting a order for costs is significantly easier than collecting on the order if the other party is determined not to pay. Frequently the only winner is the lawyer.

At this point I wouldn't care if court meeting happened on his dad's grave, all empathy for him and parents was thrown through the window", "NTA. Go get your money back. The dad made his choices and now he has to experience the consequences.", "They could have found solutions when they were in better health but chose not to.
