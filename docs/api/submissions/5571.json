That his dad is dying is terrible, but he's the one doing this to his dad, not you.", "NTA OP. Even dying people have consequences for their actions. You didn't give him cancer...but he did cause you to lose 8 grand with his lies.", "NTA. Go after the son. Yes it's sad about the dad but that is immaterial to the situation. Could also be a ploy to get you to run out the clock.\n\nThe advice I got from a good friend, if someone does something stupid, go after them for the consequences. I was rear ended twice by a 21 year old in a work truck. His only retort to it was \"I was exhausted\" when he drove off with a hit and run. I pressed charges as he could have killed someone instead of just injuring me.\n\nThis yahoo has been a terror in the area and needs a hard lesson taught to him as his parents didn't do it. Good luck.", "NTA. It's sad the father is so sick but that doesn't mean all the harassment and trouble you've had to suffer ( you had to bring in the law!) should just be forgiven. The son will presumably become even more of an ass after his father passes. I'm guessing he treats his parents like crap and his poor mother is likely in for more abuse without her husband to take some of their shitty kid's ire. 60 year old acting like a bratty teen, he can pay your legal fees from the money he makes on his paper rout.", "NTA. Like you said, the problem has always been about the son and not the parents. Just because the son is a loser and will need his parents to bail him out doesn't make it your responsibility to pay for all the damages done to your household's finances by the son's antics and frivolous cases. They had the chance to make it easy for themselves and they chose to fight tooth and nail to try to use the legal system as their own personal battering ram and the legal system doesn't take kindly to that and neither should you.", "NTA get your money. You earned it", "Sounds like they tried to run out the clock, which makes the consequences of that action their shit to deal with, not yours. If they'd taken it on the chin this would have been done and dusted yonks ago. So yeah this is on them, not you.", "Info: Is it possible to sit with the guy and work out a deal without taking the legal route? Would that alleviate stress on both sides?", "INFO ----> Are you trying to recoup the legal fees from the son or the parents?\n\nIf you are trying to recoup the legal fees from the parents, YTA\n\nIf you are trying to recoup the legal fees from the son, NTA.  I would say wait until the last possible few days you can to file the paperwork so it's less stressful for the parents.", "Thank you!", "I wish. I\u2019ve tried talking to the parents several times since they\u2019re the owners and their son is impossible to talk to. He goes from zero to 100 over every little thing. He blames us for every problem in his life through screaming, threats, calling the city, etc. He is now also blaming us for his dads cancer and has threatened suing us for it. The last altercation with him he came out in his underwear, grabbed his junk and told us to come lick it. All because we were mowing our lawn and he didn\u2019t like it. He\u2019s very unstable. \n\nNow that the parents have decided us getting a restraining order against him was somehow us attacking them we are no longer on any speaking terms. I also regularly overhear them telling people we were the ones harassing them.", "Only from the son. This only between us and him but the parents are acting like we\u2019re coming after them. It\u2019s like the son suddenly doesn\u2019t exist and they are somehow the victims. It\u2019s super weird. Extreme narcism maybe? We recently found out that In order to help him avoid legal fees they transferred his truck into their name, told a neighbor they are going to move all their money to Canadian accounts and told the court he\u2019s unemployed rather than retired. All to help him hide any money and get out of paying fees.", "Holy shit is is he 60 or 16?? Yikes you have my deepest sympathies. NTA. Get your fees back. With some luck they will be forced to sell and move away", "Then you should probably take the legal route to recoup your fees because you have exhausted all other avenues to be civil.  Some ppl can't be reasoned with.", "This is going to sound really crass, but it might be simpler getting the money from them now, while he is alive rather than see what the future holds. Ianal, but it could add complications.", "When elderly people have an overwhelming amount of stress (cancer/death/legal fees), they can behave irrationally, especially if they have underling neurological diseases such as dementia.  Their son's craziness may be rubbing off on them.  Have faith that it will all work out in the end.", "YABTA if you don\u2019t follow through and complain about this treatment later. It\u2019s not going to get better. Do something about it now.", "NTA, it's likely only going to get worse once the Dad passes and you will wish you had not waited.", "NTA. Dying or becoming terminal doesn't absolve past sins. He should make amends (aka pay your fees).", "F... Them, they are massive buttholes, NTA.", "NTA. Control your kid or they will control you. They\u2019re learning that the hard way.", "NTA and I strongly advise you to file. If you drop it, I'd bet just about anything that the son's behavior will only escalate because now he sees it as he got away with it, and knows you were the ones going after him.", "NTA", "NTA.  They are responsible for their own actions. You are not responsible for them. There are consequences to what they did and regardless of what is happening you should pursue legal action.  It is really unfortunate that it will happen this way, but the other thing is you are entitled to this money after years of torment. The fact that you were able to get a PRO says this.  Plus, if you don't get a judgment before he dies, you may not be able to get paid easily after he dies if his assets are tied up in probate.  I would try to get the judgment before then to ensure that you are legally able to claim it against the estate.", "NTA, first off, you don't know if it's real and that he is dying, second off, him dying has nothing to do with them accusing you of crimes and dragging you into court. Do you want to near the financial costs for people who openly have been tormenting you?", "There won't be any drama UNLESS the asshole son causes it. You're entitled to the money, he owes it. Either he pays up and lets his dad have a drama-free end of life, or he doesn't. NTA.", "NTA. You've been harassed by this man for years, now. They never got any sympathy for you since the beginning (they were faking it), so, nope. Take this chance. Make things right for your family.", "NTA. This is such a tough one. I wouldn't want to go for fees either in this situation, but they forced you to spend this money unnecessarily. If they had just accepted the restraining, which it sounds like they should have, none of this would be happening. \n\nThe other thing you have to consider is that their son has been harassing people for years, and presumably the parents have tried thwart any serious attempt to stop him. Maybe this is the wake up call they need. Hard to say. You could also talk to your lawyer about not going after the full attorney's fees. If you have some room in your budget and not a lot of room in your conscience, you could could cover some portion of the attorney's fees. Maybe verify that the husband is actually dying and isn't making this up to get out of legal fees. You never know.", "Right?! Dying doesn't excuse horrible actions. \n\nNTA, OP. Keep pursuing your court case.", "You called it! He\u2019s horrible to his parents. It\u2019s unbearable to listen to. Last year we called social services to try and get them help and found out they lied to protect him. Even though he can\u2019t come at us anymore it\u2019s still nerve wracking listening to them get yelled at and threatened and insulted.", "I hadn\u2019t thought of it like that. The parents pretending to side with us as a ploy. We\u2019ve heard plenty of stories around the neighborhood about their abuses too but for us being new here they are just old and vulnerable and it makes us soft towards them.", "NTA, don't let them manipulate you into dropping the charges. He picked a bad time to die.  \n\n\n(Seriously, though, their tragedy has not absolved their behavior, and they've made it clear they're willing to ruin your lives for their son. They don't deserve your kindness.)", "NTA. Karma's a bitch.", "NTA\n\nPursue legal fees.  It's really up to them if they decide to stress about the money or not.  You are owed that money.", "NTA. Get your money back. Congrats btw.", "NTA.  Press on full steam ahead.\n\nThough I'm curious about these elder abuse charges...like were they saying you were abusing them because you had a disagreement with your elderly neighbor?\n\nIf thats the case i ccompletely understand a judge asking if he was mentally ill...my understanding of elder abuse is neglect of an elder under one's care.", "NTA.  Pursue your legal claim. Every member of that family has bean appalling toward you, including perjuring themselves to undermine your legitimate claim.  Don't let them get away with it.  Don't drop your claim and pursue it in a timely fashion. If the son requests an extension of a few months to postpone the hearing date, ask you lawyer if this hurts you, and if it doesn't, you would be gracious to allow a postponement.  But you're under no obligation.", "NTA - pursue it as far as you can because guess whose gonna inherit that house? Life's too short to deal with shitty neighbors. You need that money to fix your house, and these people have let their deadbeat psycho son terrorize the neighborhood for god knows how long. Thats on them, dying or not.", "Nta\n\nMy father in law has cancer and for 7 years he pulled the \"I've been told I only have months to live\" to manipulate us before we finally cut ties.\n\nHow are you going to feel if you drop this and 3 years later he's still kicking?\n\nYeah it sucks. Life isn't fair. His own damn fault for playing a stupid game.", "NTA: Actions have consequences nothing says an illness terminal or not negates those consequences.", "Don't most restraining orders have a \"can't be within so many feet clause\"?\n\nNext door neighbors and all that I doubt he's allowed to be in the house at this point if that's the case.", "This right here\u2026 hard to hear but what I need to come to terms with. It\u2019s all manipulation. They don\u2019t care about us at all and have proved it but want us to care about them to the point of hurting ourselves.", "A week after we filed the TRO they filed one in retaliation. He checked the box saying \u201celderly abuse\u201d but in the actual complaint it was just him ranting about us hiring Spanish speaking landscapers, blaming us for their grass dying/saying we need to pay them for it and false accusations of damaging his truck by working on our yard. \n\nEvent though it was denied from start to finish it was still published online and could\u2019ve had serious effects on our careers. Once they figured out the TRO wasn\u2019t going to work they then threatened to sue us for a number of things including the dad\u2019s cancer. Yup\u2026 the son is claiming we caused the dad\u2019s cancer.", "Whoa\u2026 7 years of being manipulated like that?I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that. Very fair point too.", "Can you also post about what the neighbour did? Redditors love reading about neighbours from hell", "Depends on the order, might just be restricting them from contacting you or some other behavior.", "Unfortunately.. they keep choosing not to help themselves. NTA. And also\u2026 you\u2019d never had a problem with them\u2026 until you did. They were part of those false allegations, which if they had not done so you wouldn\u2019t have been out the 8k. The father\u2019s illness doesn\u2019t change the fact he acted poorly, or that it had real world damage to you. They should pay for that.", "So just a whole bunch of crazy.  Like I said full steam ahead.  They made their bed, it's now time to lay in it.  You're at the stage of recompense for the damages they have wrought to your life, and there are many.  Justice I'd due no matter the circumstances. \n\nI'm curious does your RO have a \"He can't be within such and such distance\" in it?", "Haha! Is there another place I can post to and share the link? The list is so long I\u2019m worried it\u2019d be too much to add on here.", "Fair point.\n\nFalse charges though?  To me that is a bump up from just \"don't try to communicate with them\"", "Yes, it\u2019s a 1000\u2019 reduced to 15\u2019 when we are getting in and out of our cars. Sucks the restraining couldn\u2019t make him move out.", "Sounds like r/ entitledpeople might be appropriate.", "If they're not actively being a danger or harassing them it's a really big step to have distance restrictions and make them move. \n\nFor false charges they can just keep it on the record and have more scrutiny on anything they bring up in the future."]}
