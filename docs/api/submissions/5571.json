They then helped him file false charges against us for elderly abuse and property damage and hid him/lied to the police for months to help him evade service. This made us have to hire an attorney. \n\n$8k later we finally won a permanent restraining order and everything against us was completely dropped. The judge told him he was ridiculous and asked him if he had a mental disorder\u2026 in court!\n\nNow we need another court date to have a judge award us legal fees. But during this whole ordeal the dad was diagnosed with terminal cancer and given 4 months to live and I\u2019m struggling with pursing more legal stuff knowing he\u2019s dying. I thought about waiting until after he passed but we\u2019re on time limit to file or lose our chance. \nEvery neighbor we know on our street 100% supports us. They\u2019ve been dealing with this abuse for decades. \n\nPS. They tried to use the dad\u2019s illness to get us to drop the restraining order against their son and then to try to get sympathy from the judge. He had no other defense in court other than, \u201c my dad is dying\u201d. We\u2019d never had an issue with the parents. This was all between us and the son but the parents have been acting like we\u2019re coming after them.\n\nPPS. We could only afford a fixer upper to live here. We spent years saving for this chance and are now also expecting our first baby. That was our dream and we\u2019re tying to live it. That $8k was a lot of money for us and a huge hit.

I am sorry for your neighbor's illness and all that he and his wife are going through.

They filed false charges against you! Fucked around, found out.", "NTA.  The son chose his behavior and thus the consequences.  You need the money as well (but you would be ok pursuing regardless).\n\nThis isn\u2019t about his parents unless they chose it to be.  And, ultimately, they did.  The hid the son.  Drive up legal costs.  They made allegations against you.  Driving up legal costs.\n\nAll very regrettable.  And my bet is that you would have loved to not have the whole nightmare never happened.  That was something only the son could have chosen; and they didn\u2019t.", "NTA.   Don't let him off the hook. It's too bad the dad is dying, but the parents helped their asshole son sue you.", "NTA.

It is unfortunate the father has a new health diagnosis but it is not related to your filing. You need to protect yourself from the son's harassment.  He alone caused this situation.

That his dad is dying is terrible, but he's the one doing this to his dad, not you.", "NTA OP. Even dying people have consequences for their actions. You didn't give him cancer...but he did cause you to lose 8 grand with his lies.", "NTA. Go after the son. Yes it's sad about the dad but that is immaterial to the situation. Could also be a ploy to get you to run out the clock.\n\nThe advice I got from a good friend, if someone does something stupid, go after them for the consequences. I was rear ended twice by a 21 year old in a work truck. His only retort to it was \"I was exhausted\" when he drove off with a hit and run. I pressed charges as he could have killed someone instead of just injuring me.\n\nThis yahoo has been a terror in the area and needs a hard lesson taught to him as his parents didn't do it. Good luck.", "NTA. It's sad the father is so sick but that doesn't mean all the harassment and trouble you've had to suffer ( you had to bring in the law!) should just be forgiven. The son will presumably become even more of an ass after his father passes. I'm guessing he treats his parents like crap and his poor mother is likely in for more abuse without her husband to take some of their shitty kid's ire. 60 year old acting like a bratty teen, he can pay your legal fees from the money he makes on his paper rout.", "NTA. Like you said, the problem has always been about the son and not the parents. Just because the son is a loser and will need his parents to bail him out doesn't make it your responsibility to pay for all the damages done to your household's finances by the son's antics and frivolous cases. They had the chance to make it easy for themselves and they chose to fight tooth and nail to try to use the legal system as their own personal battering ram and the legal system doesn't take kindly to that and neither should you.", "NTA get your money. You earned it", "Sounds like they tried to run out the clock, which makes the consequences of that action their shit to deal with, not yours. If they'd taken it on the chin this would have been done and dusted yonks ago. So yeah this is on them, not you.", "Info: Is it possible to sit with the guy and work out a deal without taking the legal route? Would that alleviate stress on both sides?", "INFO ----> Are you trying to recoup the legal fees from the son or the parents?\n\nIf you are trying to recoup the legal fees from the parents, YTA\n\nIf you are trying to recoup the legal fees from the son, NTA.  I would say wait until the last possible few days you can to file the paperwork so it's less stressful for the parents.", "Thank you!", "I wish. I\u2019ve tried talking to the parents several times since they\u2019re the owners and their son is impossible to talk to. He goes from zero to 100 over every little thing. He blames us for every problem in his life through screaming, threats, calling the city, etc. He is now also blaming us for his dads cancer and has threatened suing us for it. The last altercation with him he came out in his underwear, grabbed his junk and told us to come lick it. All because we were mowing our lawn and he didn\u2019t like it. He\u2019s very unstable. \n\nNow that the parents have decided us getting a restraining order against him was somehow us attacking them we are no longer on any speaking terms. I also regularly overhear them telling people we were the ones harassing them.", "Only from the son. This only between us and him but the parents are acting like we\u2019re coming after them. It\u2019s like the son suddenly doesn\u2019t exist and they are somehow the victims. It\u2019s super weird. Extreme narcism maybe? We recently found out that In order to help him avoid legal fees they transferred his truck into their name, told a neighbor they are going to move all their money to Canadian accounts and told the court he\u2019s unemployed rather than retired. All to help him hide any money and get out of paying fees.", "Holy shit is is he 60 or 16?? Yikes you have my deepest sympathies. NTA. Get your fees back. With some luck they will be forced to sell and move away", "Then you should probably take the legal route to recoup your fees because you have exhausted all other avenues to be civil.  Some ppl can't be reasoned with.", "This is going to sound really crass, but it might be simpler getting the money from them now, while he is alive rather than see what the future holds. Ianal, but it could add complications.", "When elderly people have an overwhelming amount of stress (cancer/death/legal fees), they can behave irrationally, especially if they have underling neurological diseases such as dementia.  Their son's craziness may be rubbing off on them.  Have faith that it will all work out in the end."]}
