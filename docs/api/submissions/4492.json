I have visited her twice already, my mom (59f) has not. \nMy plans for next year were to go to Korea for 2 weeks in April to celebrate a friend\u2019s birthday, I\u2019ve already saved up for that and I already started planning. \nNow my mom comes in: she wants to go to NYC in April, during the same 2 weeks I wanted to go to Korea. My sister said she\u2019s cool with that, she\u2019d just have to work for 3 days during those 10 days my mom would visit, meaning she\u2019d still have enough time to show my mom around. My mom said though, she\u2019d only go, if i come too. Which i kind of understand because she barely ever flies (never has on her own) and her english isn\u2019t the greatest. I told her that I already have other plans. 2 days later, my sister called me and said i\u2019m a horrible daughter and sister for ruining their plans, since my mom won\u2019t fly alone. So I go talk to my mom and say that I will come with her, if she pays for my flight which, trust me, she could easily afford. She said that I already saved money for traveling next year so I should just use that. I see where she\u2019s coming from but I don\u2019t want to spend that saved up money on a trip I don\u2019t want to go on, if that makes sense. And I also don\u2019t want to let them guilt trip me into spending it on that? It\u2019s my last year of uni so I won\u2019t have a whole lot of opportunities to travel freely like that anymore. I told them we could go in summer, since I\u2019d still have my whole summer break and I know my mom already took almost all of July off, but she said she doesn\u2019t wanna do a city trip when it\u2019s too hot. So WIBTA if I just did my own thing?

OP would be going out of their way which is why they should consider if it fits into their schedule and if sis/mom will cover the additional costs.

But maybe the answer is mom inconveniences herself and goes in the summer despite the potential for it being hot."]}
