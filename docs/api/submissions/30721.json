He said he could then last minute said he could only watch the two older ones. I assumed if he couldn\u2019t have interruptions then he wouldn\u2019t have agreed to watch an 8 and 4 year old. My mom normally refuses to watch the babies. She will watch the kids when they are older but not babies. I used to work as a lead accountant but when we had kids with my husbands travel I quit work because I didn\u2019t want my kids to spend all day in daycare since I am essentially a single mom when he travels and now with 3 I would use up all my sick days in a heartbeat because he would never agree to take off since he is the one earning more. We are on a budget so paying for a babysitter is  not an option.\nAs to him being a workaholic he works well over 10 hours a day on the days he\u2019s traveling and will not even call the kids everyday as he\u2019s too busy at work or at client dinners. Also even if he were in an office if a kid was sick and I worked one of us would have to pick up the kid from school or daycare . Emergencies happen.\nAnd yes my mom in the end did agree to take care of the baby , I took her car got to the appt about 15 min late  , but it was 90 in Texas and the 500 carseat would be trashed sitting in the sun so he did end up taking it out. \n\n\nMy husband is a workaholic. He works from 8-6 everyday with no lunch and travels 50-75% of the time. I am a stay at home mom with 3 kiddos: ages 8, 4 and 18 months. I do all the chores at home and also partially homeschool the 8 year old. \nMy husband never takes off work to help with the kids as I am a stay at home mom. Well I tweaked my shoulder and it\u2019s been hurting for 4 months. I recently got a mri and had my follow up appt. Scheduled. I didn\u2019t even bother asking him to take off to watch the kids because he never will because he always has something going on at work \ud83d\ude44but I did book the appt on the family schedule and told him about it in case a kid was sick. So I left the two older ones home with him as he was working from home. Well my youngest vomited in the car after I\u2019d been driving about 10 min. I texted him asking if he would take off work so I could still make my appt but he wouldn\u2019t respond. I was able to have my mom come over and she was willing to watch the sick kiddo so I could make the appt  but we couldn\u2019t figure out how to remove the car seat so we could wash it off. It was a new carseat and I didn\u2019t have the time to YouTube how to get it out and still make my appt because at this time I would have been over 20 minutes late. Well at this point I went into his office at home and asked him to get off his call and he completely blew up at me.  At this point I had  already tried calling and texting him.\nI get that I shouldn\u2019t interrupt his work call but parenting is an equal responsibility and had she been in daycare one of us would have to pick her up. Plus he\u2019s on calls 75% of the day. Am I the asshole for making him get off his work call to help with his daughter ?", "created_utc": 1699639192, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17s9r6n/aita_for_interrupting_my_husbands_work_call_to/", "score": 2392, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mom came over, so the sick child is being taken care of, why did you need him to get off his work call?", "I\u2019m pretty sure your husband\u2019s workaholic tendencies is precisely how you are able to be a stay at home mom fulltime. If you want him to step up and do more childcare and work less, that\u2019s a conversation worth having. However, that would mean you would likely need to step up in certain ways yourself. If childcare should be fully equal in your eyes, shouldn\u2019t bills and financing be also?\n\nYTA about the car seat thing. You could have either figured it out (you had no time to google or YT but plenty to rush home and interrupt the call? Bullshit) or go to your appointment and deal with the seat later. This was not even remotely urgent and not worth interrupting.", "INFO:  If he was working at the office and not at home, would you have put as much emphasis on him?\n\nJust because he's at home, doesn't mean his responsibility at work is any less.  I really don't understand people who think that just because their firends/so's/spouses work from home, they are available as if they weren't in the office.  Work is work.  If his work is affording you the ability to stay home and take care of the family then there's your answer.  No you don't get to come at him for not helping you during working hours.  That's your job.  Communication is key here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA Verdict:  YTA", "ESH because no one is communicating or dealing with the actual problem.\n\nThe actual problem is you don\u2019t have support care. You think you do because your husband is home but he is not a reliable option, especially for a last minute thing that isn\u2019t technically an emergency.\n\nNow, whether he *should* be a reliable option is a different conversation, one that would involve talking about a drastic change is his schedule, potentially even a change in occupation, and rearranging how work and parenting is divided in your relationship. But for now, the way you\u2019ve both agreed to divide things, he can\u2019t (shouldn\u2019t?) be considered available just because he\u2019s working from home.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for a parent who works at home to not be an option for these situations. It\u2019s why sometimes people ask family and friends to help out with childcare. It\u2019s why those who can afford it often have a babysitter/nanny even when someone is a SAHP. People aren\u2019t meant to do everything alone and there no way to do it 100% of the time.\n\nYou two need to sit down and admit to each other your current arrangement isn\u2019t working. You either need to find support outside of your elderly mother - potentially by hiring it - or you need to decide together to adjust how things are divided.\n\nI will also add that \u201cMommy Burnout\u201d is real.

I would not have bothered him for that.", "You didn't interrupt him to watch his daughter, you called him to uninstall a car seat\n\nI also don't get why when you knew you were already minimum of 20 minutes late why you even tried still going (every where I know would have refused to see you by then)\n\nTo be honest your mother was free and willing to have the sick kiddo I would have asked her to have all three in the first place - if his work is such that he can't be interrupted I wouldn't have had him with the older two either", "8-6 is a workaholic???

That should have been made clear as soon as your first kid as born, but if after 8 years even though you say \"parenting is an equal responsibility\" it seems like you've never actually talk to him about it and just decided it would be easier to just let it slide and don't even ask him for \"help\". But after 8 years, why would he actually even bother considering it by know it's clear he knows you rather ask someone else for help if he just ignores you enough? NTA, but you should have put your foot down when your first kid was born.\n\nAlso, apparently he doesn't even care about you being injured? Wow.", "YTA just because he works from home doesn't mean he should be interrupted to do non work things.

I\u2019m 80% in meetings, but if my husband needed me in that situ, I\u2019d drop off for two mins and dial back in.

Both of you seem to have resentment. ESH", "NTA\nYou\u2019re injured. You made the appointment in advance and put it on the family schedule. Husband was aware and it was a day he was WFH and not traveling. Seeing as he\u2019s been skipping his lunch breaks (breaks are legally required BTW), he likely could have scheduled his meetings around the appointment time to be available to keep an eye on the kids. Or he could have taken the day or afternoon off. If he\u2019s not taking any time off otherwise he likely has a good amount banked. Him working a full time job and her working full time as SAHM doesn\u2019t absolve him from all parenting duties from 8am-6pm. Emergencies happen, illness and injuries happen. You have to work together to get stuff done. \n\nHate to break it to all the SAHMs whose husbands convinced them they can\u2019t do anything during the workday but nobody\u2019s job even the CEO is that important and your husband is probably using it as an excuse to not have to parent or do anything around the house. They want to be a paycheck, not a partner.

It sounds like OP needed help getting a vom-smelling carseat out of the car. She also states that the husband travels A LOT (75% of the time? Wow). I wonder if how OP is feeling is a symptom of a bigger issue. Yes, husband is working to provide but she\u2019s hurt and a hurt person can\u2019t carry on looking after 3 kids forever without some sort of care. If husband is gone that often then I imagine she isn\u2019t getting much downtime. 8-6, while not workaholic hours, makes me wonder what kind of parent he is after hours. More info needed but leaning toward NAH.", "I'm gonna go with ESH. For the people saying Y T A, imagine for a second that there was a full blown emergency and her husband was completely unreachable because he simply ignored all attempts to contact him. From what happened here, that's exactly how it would go. I know he's at work and work is important but so is his family. This sounds like a one-time thing because she was injured and needed some support. That being said, interrupting the call just to get the carseat out of the car was completely unnecessary and could have waited until after the appointment. In the near future, I suggest you and your husband sit down and talk through a plan for last minute situations like this and emergencies so that you can navigate them better.", "NTA.

Child care costs are extremely expensive so we don\u2019t know that she\u2019s staying home because she wants to, but it may make more financial sense for their family. Also if she was working, then the husband wouldn\u2019t be able to get away with not doing anything around the house.\n\nAlso, of course you can take time off last minute if you have a family emergency.

You think he is a workaholic because he works from 8-6.\n\nYou really don't understand or appreciate that your husband is working. Just because he is working from home does not mean he is at your beck and call to help with the kids. You need to respect his time and his job - which you don't do. Until you start working full time - then the work hours the kids are your responsibility as you are the SAHM.", "INFO: was this an important call? *Could* he have gotten off it? \n\nMy opinion changes a lot depending on whether this was a team meeting where they were all just sort of chatting and blowing off steam or a meeting that would've essentially had to end without him.", "Its sad to see so many people comment that just because he is the breadwinner that he does not have any other responsibilities to his spouse and kids.  She also said 8-6 everyday.  I am going to assume every day means 7 days a week not 5 days like most people.  Additionally, being a stay at home mom is still work and she still needs time to take care of herself including her health.  The level of misogyny here is just staggering.", "YTA. \n\nYou interrupted your husband while he was working, making the only income to pay all the bills allowing you to stay home with your kids. \n\nLike... nothing more needs to be said. All the nonsense about the car seat is just that, nonsense that's irrelevant and you're just trying to use it as a justification.", "I've been in similar situations as a SAHM. You need to be handling this differently. You are completely reasonable to want childcare cover for your medical needs. It's not reasonable to expect you to not be able to schedule medical appointments or look after your medical needs. So you do need to fix this and your husband needs to participate in fixing it. However you interrupting his work calls is not ok. It makes him look unprofessional, and he could lose his job. \n\nWhat you need to do is find a support network. Your mom is part of your support network but you need more. I have tried multiple ways and I would say you need to hire support. Other SAHM moms with workaholic husbands are not a good source of support because they are just as desperate as you for help. Like drowning people, they'll only drag you down as they try to save themselves.  If you help them, they will not help you back. I found this out the hard way. They will use you for babysitting mercilessly, but will never be there when you need babysitting. You need to find paid babysitters with whom you can schedule appointments for them to watch the kids. \n\nFor most of the times when things seem tough with 3 kids, you can power through it. I've spent many a night in the urgent care with all my kids because my husband was out of town and I didn't have anyone to watch the other kids so I could take the sick kid to the emergency room. But for some appointments, you really do need to be there alone, especially anything complex or with testing.\n\nAnother thing you can do is you can make it an issue with your husband. Even though he may claim it's impossible for him to get time off work, that's probably not true. Especially for people who travel a lot for work, there is usually some slack given to them to compensate for the fact that they are away from their families on nights and weekends. The employer will suck every drop of lifeblood out of him if he allows it, but that doesn't mean it's required for him to stay employed. If you need him to take care of his own children for a couple hours so you can go to the doctor, It just needs to be scheduled in advance and blocked out on his calendar. The way you do this is you have him on the cellphone and your doctor's scheduling desk on your landline and he checks his calendar for availability to watch the kids while you are working with the doctor's office on scheduling your appointment. He might have to use his vacation days for it but that's just how it has to be, you're his wife, not his slave. Your health matters too.", "NTA.  I really don't get how people are saying YTA.  You planned ahead.  You are injured and needed medical attention.  Your mom usually will not look after the baby.  He didn't clear HIS calendar to accommodate a family need.  You tried to cope, but baby got sick.  I work a corporate job and if my family needs me, I can take time off.  I can ask to have even my most critical meetings rescheduled (and yes, this is in the US - not a bastion of employee rights) because I need to be elsewhere just then.  I can even cancel a meeting  here or there, or go on leave for weeks.  If you end up needing surgery, is he going to just keep working?   Will people still say, you're the at home parent so fuck your needs?\n\nWhat makes your husband a workaholic is not his hours, but his inflexibility and attachment to the idea that he HAS to be there for ALL of it.  You look after the kids, and that's work too.  But when you have needs, he's still got to be your backup.   That's how it works in every house I know with a SAHP - and we run to SAHDs in my family more than moms.  Sure, most of the time, the at home spouse takes care of family and home, but when the chips are down, the working parent takes time if they need to to help out.  That's not grandma's responsibility, though it's great if she's willing to help.  It's the responsibility of a spouse to be help out when needed.", "Quoting one of the tv hosts:  \"you don't have a husband and your kids do not have a father - all of you have a room-mate\".

I am wondering, if the house got on fire, would he also be enraged that you dared to interrupt his \"very important job\" in order to save his life?  He is practically run away from all of you to be married to his job and you are not even a mistress in this relationship.
