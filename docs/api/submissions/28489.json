Here\u2019s some context: my late brother used to pay 440$ monthly to Mia which she used to settle her utilities, food bills, clothing and things. Her actual salary supposedly went to her rent. She\u2019s a waitress, so she doesn\u2019t get paid much, but she also got kicked out of school, so her fault. \n\nAs I said, she phoned me yesterday, expecting me to tell her the date I would start paying child support to my niece. But the thing is, I never agreed to anything. She called me out of the blue with her entitled narcissistic voice and demanded to know when I would start paying. So I asked what on earth gave her the idea I would give a cent to a child that isn\u2019t mine, nevertheless hers. I should add that I have no relationship with my niece and have only seen her a few times unexpectedly. Nor did my brother have a relationship with his daughter. Mainly because of her toxic annoying mother who thinks the world evolves around her, and I like to keep my family small. \n\nShe rudely replied why wouldn\u2019t  I want to provide financial help to my niece, as we are family. Then she went rattling on about it\u2019s my job as her uncle to look after her and all that family nonsense. The conversation carried on for a while, so I'll just trim it down. I told her to shut up and to ask her family, who don\u2019t even like her, for money and stop bothering the man of the brother she treated horribly. After I mentioned her family, I hit a trigger that set her off. \n\nShe began to insult my brother's funeral, my family's private mausoleum, and called me disgusting for hoarding so much of \u201cmy\u201d money and refusing to give her anything. She even went as far as to hate my children and call them horrible names. But I just hung up as I was tired of hearing her voice. \n\nShe\u2019s still angry from reading my brother's will and found out I Inherited everything. And that I was giving my brother $100,000 annually and he only gave her $440 monthly.\nBut none of this is my problem, it\u2019s not my child.
