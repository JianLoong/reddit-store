Jack definitely has an attitude problem and up until recently I've avoided it. Yesterday Jack was over at my house and I found out that Evan left his lights, fan, etc all on on his room before going to school. My electric bill is outrageous and I've discussed this with him.\n\nI told Evan that I'll simply take his phone away the next time he doesn't turn off things in his room. So I took away his phone when he came home with Jack. Evan was upset and Jack actually told me I just can't take his phone away like that. I told him to mind his business and his mouth before I take his phone away too.\n\nHe said I wasn't allowed to take his phone away. So I did. I said go complain to Daddy (my brother). Both boys were livid at me and Jack asked to go home so I dropped him off. Of course my brother called me and demanded that I give the phone back. I asked him if his child learned his lesson and he said I was over the line.\n\nI said once Jack apologizes and agrees to mind his own business then I'll give it back. This morning at school he and my brother came up to me and apologized and I gave it back. \n\nAfter the boys left to go to school my brother said don't you ever take my kid's phone away. I told him he wasn't lost in the woods and this wouldn't have happened if you didn't spoil him and raise a brat. Shame on you and your ex.\n\nHe and his ex believe taking a phone away from your kid is borderline abuse.\n\nEdit: We live down the street from their middle school and my brother lives 5 miles away. That's why I couldn't kick my nephew out. I promise you my nephew won't run his mouth at me again.\n\nAnd I didn't give the phone back on purpose. I wanted to piss off my brother so he'd have to deal with a crying 13yo brat all night.", "created_utc": 1692798689, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15z4jm7/aita_for_taking_my_nephews_phone_away/", "score": 983, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You tell them what is acceptable and unacceptable behavior as a guest. But you do not punish or discipline anyone in your home that is a guest.

You took your nephews phone away just for questioning you. Not only that, when your brother asked for it back you felt like you didn't have to?

Please share this with your family!  Abuse is physically beating your child with it without some sort of belt extension cord wooden spoon shoe ext.  I have gone through all of them and so many others.  Abuse is not feeding your kid or even worse making them sit and watch others as they do.  Either regular or intermittent.  Abuse is verbal or emotional telling them how much they ruined your life or marriage or whatever!  \n\nI am so sick of people saying that discipline is abuse.  Taking a phone away for bad behavior after a warning was given is not; LOUDER FOR THOSE OF YOU IN THE BACK NOT ABUSE!  A phone is a luxury not a necessity and for a 12 or 13 year old is probably the best form of punishment there is.  Taking gaming consoles and other non essential electronics also another good way to get a message through.  Now to be clear these kids are not working age so there is no reason for them to need a phone and homework can be done with a computer or phone as needed with it being returned upon completion. \n\nAs for your brother I would let them know that their son\u2019s bad behavior and attitude is rubbing off on your son when visiting if disrespectful behavior occurs then the phone will be taken away and returned when they go home.  Or just send them home when they start acting out if they can\u2019t behave.  If they are visiting with their parents then let them discipline their own child.  But when they drop off or their little crotch gobblin then they are subject to your rules of conduct and discipline would be up to you.  Short of corporal punishment I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad compromise.  If they can\u2019t deal with that then don\u2019t have the kid over without the parents.  If they can\u2019t control their kids they can stay home and not visit.  I know it sounds harsh however would you rather take immediate action and nip things in the bud or let it become a lifestyle.

That is manipulation, not good parenting.", "YTA and also lucky your brother didn\u2019t just report the phone as stolen.  You have zero right to to keep his phone.", "So just an FYI....leaving a light on all day costs less then 5 cents.  Maybe taking a look at yourself and the relationship you have with your child is more important then 5 cents.  Just saying....", "nta, someone obviously has to parent that kid, since his aren't doing it.", "Nah you are a special type of crazy Lmao lucky brother didn\u2019t come take it by force or call the cops", "Gonna go against the grain and say ESH. Maybe it\u2019s a generational thing, and I don\u2019t know the ages of you and your brother. I am nearing 30, and when I was a kid, any adult had the authority to punish me, especially aunts and uncles. It\u2019s not like the neighbor down the street was allowed to beat me, but it was a cultural norm at the time that to take things away, lecture, correct behavior, etc. My parents would have 100% backed up my aunt/uncle if they took my phone for talking back to them like that. Little kid thinks he\u2019s grown telling you what you have the right to do. Even now with my niece, I know my SIL would 100% back up something like this, and we come from different states and cultural backgrounds. We are of the same generation, and we were raised with the same expectations of kids vs adults. \n\nHowever, the phone should have been returned to your brother when you dropped your nephew off at home. Keeping it in your possession was over the top, especially when your brother demanded it back. While I agree with you that taking a phone away is an appropriate punishment, you are stepping over the line by keeping it overnight when he\u2019s not your kid. A punishment you DO have the authority to enact is telling him if he speaks to you like that in your own home, he is no longer invited over. You have control over who is and who isn\u2019t allowed in your home. Then follow up the next times he\u2019s disrespectful, take him home and tell him he can come back another day after he apologizes. Your brother can\u2019t force you to take his kid if he\u2019s not invited into your home.", "Im gonna get downvoted\u2026 but NTA.

The phone may be used by the nephew but he sure as hell isn't paying for it. And having a phone isn't a right, it is a privilege and privileges can be revoked based on behavior, grades, etc. Children have and are entitled to a certain level of autonomy, but they do not get complete autonomy until adulthood.

A teacher can't punish a student for not eating their lunch, that's not in the code of conduct. A school can't spank child for acting up. A  teacher can't \"take away dessert\" from a student for misbehavior. \n\nIf i am babysitting, i will have gone over basic rules with the parent about what i am and am not allowed to do, how to handle inappropriate behavior, etc. if the parent says that the punishment for cursing at me and being disrespectful is to ban them from playing on their games, then i will follow instruction. if a situation arises where the child does something inappropriate but i havent really been given instruction on how to handle that, unless its a crime, or causing harm, I'll just let it be for the moment and have a conversation with her mom that night about the behavior and how they would want me to handle it in the future.

To me, that would just be dealt with reminding, talking about why it\u2019s important for the planet and electricity bill (even tell him to contribute a small part of allowance to it) to remember to turn them on, and maybe some visual aids like post it notes, arrows, things that are attention grabbing and kids can see, to start forming a HABIT. once the habit is there, there will be no issue, but it\u2019s not there yet.", "I\u2019d argue this person is a lose your phone for everything type because she doesn\u2019t mention other interventions she has tried outside of explaining cost.", "since we're in the legal realm.. this is getting dangerously close to extortion....", "An apology for how Jack \u201cactually told me I can\u2019t just take his phone away like that\u201d.

Some kids dont do well with loose reminder and convos. Some kids respond better to consequences. I dont see taking a phone away as a harmful or abusive consequence, it seems appropriate. If the kid doesn\u2019t want to be grounded or lose phone access, they have to take on the responsibility of reminding themselves and teaching themselves to follow the rules (turn lights off). Kids are super careless so its easy to brush off these verbal lessons. Teaching them accountability and responsibility will help them in life. sometimes there are consequences when you \u201cforget\u201d things in life. Maybe the kid will be motivated to create their own post it note system to remember. \n\nas long as she isnt being harsh and malicious, I dont see how having or not having a phone for a short period of time is of any real consequentialness", "I guess we just differ in opinion because I dont see removing a phone from a child as a monumental or bad thing, and I dont think a child should expect/be totally attached to a phone. It should be treated as a privilege for good behavior and following rules, not a guarantee that feels \u201charsh\u201d when removed. If rules aren\u2019t followed, certain privileges are paused until its corrected. Taking a phone away for one evening from a child is probably healthier for their mental well being (completely unrelated to it being for punishment, mostly because the internet and social media are negatively addicting and can be very toxic to kids, and is connected to the steep rise in depression and suicidal tendencies in youth). \n\nJust a difference of opinion I guess.
