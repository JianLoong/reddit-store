So yeah that would be enough for me to go \"oh that little piece of sh*t, let me teach you a lesson\".", "Yeah what an unhinged response \ud83d\ude02 just drive over and ask for the phone?", "This is a phone for crying out loud.  It is not a car, a Rolex watch, it\u2019s a Phone! No wonder kids are so rotten these days.  He disrespected and got a consequence. I like that they did what they said they would.  Amazing.", "...are you really that dense you think the cops wouldn't help with a stolen phone(a felony in many places) or is this one of those really bad bait posts where you just argue with the comments making yourself sound unintelligent for amusement?", "being a relative does not give you automatic rights to enact discipline. It seems like OPs sibling does not want OP to discipline his kids. YOU can give another relative authority to discipline your kids, thats fine. But thats not an assumption you should make.", "Your boundary being \"if you say I'm not entitled to your property I will forcibly take it and keep it until you apologise for saying that I am not entitled to your property\" you are an Adult, behave like one and maybe you'll get the respect you think you can intimidate out of children.", "*You* sound like a brat. If he\u2019s that much of a problem stop having him in your house. Plain and simple.", "God you sound like such an idiot it\u2019s actually hilarious, I knew friends with mothers like you when I was a teen, your actions will come back to bite you, it\u2019s just a matter of time lol. Good luck to your son, he\u2019s gonna need it", "Does it hurt?", "You\u2019re acting like a way bigger brat than your nephew did. Sounds like your brother asserted his boundaries over it too, hope it was worth straining your relationship with him over. YTA.", "If you leave your child at your sibling's house, then the sibling absolutely has the right to discipline the child within the home. This is obviously not accounting abusive discipline such as verbal degradation or physical punishments, but if you don't agree with the boundaries, don't let your kid stay at that house? It's fairly simple to grasp.", "You left a kid under another adult's authority. They will enforce their rules. Of course they will. If you don't like those rules you can discuss them with them. And you either come to an understanding or you stop leaving your kid with them. But while there's an adult taking care of your kid, that adult is the authority.", "Since always? Especially with kids when they're being punished.\n\nThey're 13-year-olds, not stock brokers waiting for the market to open and OP lost them millions. That phone is for texting, playing games, and Googling \"what are boobs.\"\n\nIt's no different than restricting computer or phone access until a kid is done with their homework. Or taking a toy away when a kid can't play nice with it or share. Babysitters, parents, and caregivers have been doing this since the concept of modern parenthood was conceived.\n\nHave you never heard of items being confiscated at schools? Like, really bruh?", "If I was a child and not following the adult's house rules, yes.  And I have friends whose house rule is no cell phones at dinner so my phone goes in the basket along with theirs.", "I guess. I got told off/punished by family members I was staying with, so I took the two roles as being one in the same. But I see your point.", "I was also going to mention this about electricity lolol. Turn your AC down and unplug these running appliances you never use..", "Statistically, speaking, it's extremely unlikely that OP is a boomer", "I'd just start inviting anyone I knew with a Rolex over lol. \n\n\"Welp you're in my house, that watch is mine now. Thems the rules\"", "Yeah. I wasn't particularly a little shit or anything, but when I was over at any of my cousins houses, my auntie/uncle was the one in charge. If I'd given them cheek my mum would have been fine with them telling me off/turning off the PlayStation or whatever it was we were playing with.", "I dont see it like the kid crossed the line. I see it like a fragile ego adult that had his decision questioned and didnt react properly. He or she couldve explained that its not his place to interfere and thats that. But op instead went on a pathetic power trip, took the phone, and told him to go cry to daddy. I mean really? Cry to daddy. Op is the child in this scenario", "Unintentional actions still have very real consequences. important life lesson. phone on the other hand is not actually that important.", "I 100% see taking a phone away for a short period of time as a very small punishment. You\u2019re welcome to disagree. \n\nIf a kid is so emotionally enraged by that already, they likely are building an addiction to their phone and probably wont be a bad thing to remind them the phone is a privilege, not a guarantee.", "So its likely shes /been/ trying to teach him and has /been/ reminding him of this rule before resorting to removing the phone \u2026 for a short period of time\u2026.. its not going to harm the child, it will teach them about consequences of forgetting certain rules.\n\nwhat would be more appropriate of a punishment for them? I dont see no cell phone as a bad thing. He can go outside or play games or do some art. Its not a cruel punishment. kids dont need that level of dependency on a phone at such a young age.", "I agree with the last part but I don\u2019t agree with calling the cops on my sibling. I\u2019d literally show up to their house.", "calling the cops out of spite is also insane behavior", "Nobody is going to jail over a stolen phone LMAO what fantasy land do you live in", "I'm terrified. And my kids will go into foster care while I do life in prison with weed smokers and people who lied on their resumes?", "right? I so agree. I find it really odd that ppl seem to think a nephew can disrespect his aunts rules however they want and not face a very simple and minimal consequence such as -gasp- not being able to touch their phone for a short period of time. \n\nphone should have been returned to the dad upon drop off.", "The aunt only has the authority to discipline their niblings if the parent gives them authorization to do it. it doesnt matter if you are related to them, YOU DO NOT GET TO DECIDE if YOU get to punish someone elses kid.", "enforcing rules is not the same as enacting discipline. unless you are explicitly given authority from another that childs parent to enact disciplinary actions to their kids, you do not have the authority to enact punishments to someone elses child. thats insane.", "This isn\u2019t school", "When you hand a kid over to the school, you are giving them authority to enforce and discipline kids within their rules. thats NOT the same thing as letting your kid go over to someone's house. unless the parent gives you the authority to do that, no, you dont get to punish someone elses kids. \n\nIf you sent your kids to their friends house and found out that those parents decided to punish your kid for \"not following their rules\" by taking things away from them that were NOT THEIRS. that would be a problem, unless you gave those parents authority to discipline your kid. The same goes for family too. just because you are an aunt/uncle, you dont get to punish those kids without the parents consent.", "Do they keep it when you leave?", "What has being a child got to do with it?  You can't just steal stuff from children.\n\nSo you are in my house and I steal your phone and demand you apologise to me before I give it back the next day?\n\nBueno or no bueno?", "If your parents gave your relatives that authority, then thats between you and your parents. but you do not automatically get rights to punish someone elses kids just because you are related to them.", "Yeah ok but it\u2019s still boomer mentality", "Ya I get that but they were refusing to give it back, I\u2019m not from America so personally if I rang the guards in my country to say my brother won\u2019t give back my kids phone, they\u2019d just show up and take the phone back themselves, nothing more would happen unless you specifically wanted it to. From the post sounds like OP doesn\u2019t respect their siblings parenting anyways and showed even if they did show up they weren\u2019t going to return the phone without an apology. They believe they\u2019re above their sibling and god help them trying to deal with a person like that", "Going to jail? No. Having a record and a fine? Yes", "Going online and asking if you're an Asshole only to argue with the verdict when they do call you out on being an Asshole.", "You could've just said it's the latter lol", "I'm sure the police with love your attitude and you'll have a very pleasant time together.", "If it was not his aunt, but say a family friend or a baby sitter or someone NOT related to you, it would be totally different. But if the two kids are so close, then the aunt is probably like a \"second mom\", and it isn't crossing a boundary to remove the phone to get the point across of \"please do not show this disrespect in my household.\"", "It's an adult being responsible for a kid. The adult has the authority.", "I'm not arguing with you. I said I could see your point.", "I agree with your reasoning but I am from the US unfortunately and I wouldn\u2019t call the cops bc it can actually turn deadly", "yeah. it\u2019s actually wild how many of these comments are treating no-phone-time like genuine world ending abuse. Actually baffling. kids dont need that level of dependency on a cell phone anyways. just my opinion.", "authority to care for the child to a limited capacity, not punish and discipline a kid that isnt yours.", "Which is why I specifically mentioned I\u2019m not from America, I know you\u2019re police force, well I\u2019ll just say aren\u2019t the best lol. Ours aren\u2019t either but it\u2019s on a completely different scale"]}
