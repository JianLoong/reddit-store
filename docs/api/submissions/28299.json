It wasn't his place to do any of that, step father or not.\n\nMom played a game of chance and lost. If Jimmy is happy where he is, that's all that matters. Him being somewhere he feels safe, loved, protected and nurtured is all that matters. If the courts deemed Jimmy can't even be in the house with Tim, mom should be looking at him as a huge red lag. She chose to stay with the man her son can't be in the same location with. Evidently that's what mattered most to her. \n\nYou're NTA at all.
