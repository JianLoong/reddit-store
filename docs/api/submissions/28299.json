Him being somewhere he feels safe, loved, protected and nurtured is all that matters. If the courts deemed Jimmy can't even be in the house with Tim, mom should be looking at him as a huge red lag. She chose to stay with the man her son can't be in the same location with. Evidently that's what mattered most to her. \n\nYou're NTA at all.

He was the worst kid I had ever met but he just had a lot of problems originating from other problems and eventually the root cause of everything could be traced back to bad parenting. I took it upon myself to fix him and I did just that. He has been grounded only twice in the last 13 months. Great kid now. From the idiot of his whole school to one of the smartest kid in his new school. From an emotional fighter who used to cry, scream, threaten and everything else you can think of whenever he didn't get his way to a nice boy who listens all the time. He's now a much better kid than even I was. He doesn't complain when it's time to go to bed or anything else. Of course, he now also sees that good behavior gets rewarded.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour story reminds me of my step kids and I'm sad for them. Their lives will be a mess for a minimum of 2 years because of their mom. Mine should be fine within a month. I can see that he hasn't even been able to log into his xbox from here. Last connected 2 weeks ago which was my last week with them. It's been nearly 4 days since they should've been back and yet he hasn't played. Something's up.

Then moved to he had to talk to his ex, but doesn't specify exactly how everything came out. If he hadn't heard about CPS's final report yet, just that they were called (which would be a reasonable course of action due to the police being called regarding a child custody arrangement) then I can totally see how if her first reaction was to yell at him, that he would laugh. And it never says that he called the ex. I read it as the ex calling him. Either way, I wouldn't go so far as to say he's the A for his initial reaction in petty karma which I think many people would fall into.", "Yes but then it reads as though OP is more amused at point scoring over the ex instead of being concerned about his son's welfare. I realise this may not be the case but that's how the OP sounds.", "If that\u2019s the case why mention the touching at all?

Or maybe it\u2019s just this sub.", "I think he's emphasizing the point scoring because that's what he's asking for judgment on. He's not going to write in asking \"AITA for caring about my son's welfare?\" because the answer to that is obviously no. \n\nLook, sometimes when you're divorced and your ex hurts and neglects your kid, you can feel about 500 things all at once. Devastation, frustration, sorrow, anger, and, yeah, triumph when they finally face a consequence. \n\nI don't blame OP for not wanting to get into the dark stuff when that's not the point of the post.", "This sub is particularly bad."]}
