It's a very strange conversation for your brother and his wife to be having, and then to bring it up to your wife, your children's mother, is so disrespectful.\n\nYou did the right thing.

Good for you you sound like a wonderful father it was right of you to shut that down as soon as you heard it was going on and to protect your youngest from those kind of words.

Don't let anyone guilt you guys into changing your mind I am super proud of you as a dad!", "NTA.\n\nBut the brother sure is for making up hurtful stories and so is the new villain on the scene, his wife, who evidently likes to stir up drama.\n\nBetter off without them at the holidays.", "NTA\n\nAs someone who is adopted (at birth) -- I think ppl are often stuck in the mentality that adoption is an act of charity. Or a lesser-than option. Even more so for ppl who adopt older children.\n\nGuess what? Parents got something they wanted. They aren't just sacrificing themselves for greater good. I mean, yes, some are to a degree, but the majority prob couldn't have children otherwise.

I can see a world where the two of us would discuss why a couple would adopt another child, but it wouldn't be a judgement, just curiosity. If your brother had just fully apologized, acknowledged his own stigma/confusion around the issue, and assured you that he would never say something like that around your son- or ever in general- then maybe you could forgive. Maybe. But he did the opposite in doubling down that you can't possibly WANT your son.", "NTA it's weird how brother is married after already being wed before.

Sorry I'm petty when it comes to off handed attacks on me and my children", "NTA\n\n\nIt's none of their business why you adopted your kid, and honestly to imply you were guilted into it, is so hurtful and completely inappropriate.  Sounds like his wife is jealous that you guys have 5 kids and she is a step mom of his teens.", "NTA but I feel like the kids might look forward to seeing each other and this just sounds like adults drama that you could talk through rather than make big gestures like this", "NTA. This was a conversation that shouldn't have even happened behind closed doors. The fact that your SIL was comfortable enough to bring it to your wife shows a clear lack of good judgement. Completely and entirely innapropriate for her. \n\nI don't fault you for not allowing someone this insensitive around your children.", "Your brother would be happy to leave his wife out at Xmas?\n\nSorry, that was just my very first thought. On to the question; NTA. You can invite, or not invite, anyone to your home as you see fit.", "INFO: This seems like an overreaction to a single comment.  They've know your youngest kid for 6 years, have they in some way mistreated him or gave any indication he was 'less than' your bio kids? And is your plan never to see them again, or just not for Christmas?", "INFO: Do you have reason to think that your brother or his wife would bring it up again, esp around the kids? \n\nI understand that it was an inappropriate question for her to ask and a hurtful thing for them even to think, but IMO there's a big difference in terms of irresponsibility between asking you in conversation and saying something in front of the kids. If you think it's a real danger, you absolutely can't let them be around him. If you don't, and you're basically just punishing them, then I think it's a bit harsh.", "I think it\u2019s an overreaction. If it were me and I was confident about my decision I would have just answered no and moved on. I think there is something deeper here happening. Either way NAH", "NTA\n\nYou would think that an adult would have enough sense not to say such a thing to a kid, but at the same time you would think SIL would also have enough sense not to say that to your wife so maybe not... I'd also be worried that your nephews would say something. At 13 and 15 they should have more of a filter than a younger kid would, but who's to say they wouldn't say something similar if this kind of conversation was had with them around and think it's fine to say things like that?", ">He said that my son probably already knows\n\nNope, keep this snake out of your home.

Wtf?!?!\n\nNTA", "NTA in general, but also a slight YTA when you take into consideration that you're excluding and punishing your nephews over something that they had absolutely no control or influence in. If your SIL has gross opinions about your adoption, absolutely feel free to keep her out of celebrations and eventually have a frank discussion with her about that, but I can understand why you feel the way that you do right now. You should reconsider the option of just inviting your brother and your nephews because it's really not fair to take it out on the kids when they did nothing wrong.", "YTA kind of. They were having a conversation and she asked a question and when you told your brother the question bothered you he apologized. Accept the apology and move on. You're dragging it out and turning it into melodrama for no reason at all.", "ESH.  Adopting after having biological children is fairly unusual.  Sounds like brother and sil speculated privately why you did.  And sil asked.  Maybe in a somewhat less polite manner but your reaction to exclude them at Christmas is over the top imo.  Your brother hasnt said anything to your son in the 6 years he\u2019s been part of your family so why would you think he would now?", "NTA This was a lousy thing for your SIL to say. I think you are a good father for standing by your child. I wonder how they could have these thoughts for 6 years.", "YTA Adopting when you already have 4 is not something most people would do.  I'm not saying it's wrong, it's just something different.  People talk and wonder when something is different.  In a one on one conversation, your SIL asked about it and simply voiced the theory, as people tend to do.\n\n{edit removed unnecessary snarky comment\\]", "ESH. They for what they said and you for over-reacting about it. Sure it was thoughtless, nosey, rude, but they asked a question that they didn\u2019t know the answer to: they didn\u2019t ask other people behind your back, gossip or make insinuations, they asked you direct, and then your brother apologised for thinking it. Surely it\u2019s enough to be firm and straight with them and say nothing could be further from the truth and you never want to hear them say that again, and let that be the end of it. Yes SIL is talking about you now, but she is right, Christmas is ruined for them if you plan on splitting their family up on the day, and after you have had so many xmases together you just toss them to the curb for one stupid comment, so I\u2019m inclined to think her reaction is not an over-reaction like yours was, but a fair assessment of the situation they are now in.", "NTA... BUT maybe you should allow him to come or at least the kids... They still cousin and they were caught by strage bullets.\n\nMaybw it's because I got no brother or Sister, ruining the kids relation with their cousin seems too fuckdd up for me.", "NTA opinions like these should be kept to herself that child is your baby no matter where they came from christmas doesn't need that kind of negativity", "Having the direct talk is good. Not sure how long you can avoid them for though. They're still family.", "Where did he get the idea you were \u201c guilted\u201d into it? By who? It seems like a strange notion.", "Wtf? Why is it any of their business anyways? What a horrible thought to think.. what ever happened to unconditional love despite being blood? NTA at all. They are the AH's. Screw em.", "NAH. I understand why this might offend you. However it\u2019s a very valid question to wonder why you adopted. No matter the circumstances of an adoption, family members should always be able to understand the reason", "Honestly the comment/question was a bit below the belt, but not that much. Its a legitimate question. She is right, most people don\u2019t adopt when they already have 4 kids. And you reacted over the top to this. All you had to do was say that no you weren\u2019t guilted into it and that you would appreciate it if they didn\u2019t say anything like that in front of the kids. And you can\u2019t say your brother did anything wrong. He just mused about things with his partner. He didn\u2019t gossip or spread lies about you. \n\nI am going to say YTA because the way you reacted is honestly too much and makes it seem like there *is* in fact something you are sore about", "NTA \n\nBut how did you ruin Christmas for them? Because she will not have to get up that morning to cook / clean & do things at her house? Oh no.. The horror.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe is the AH for saying/asking that & then telling others you are AH's for saying you don't feel comfortable having that in your own home.\n\nI would stay away from her.

I wouldn't let them around the kids again.", "Wow. Not even a STRANGER wouldmtbe allowed to say anything like that to me.", "Apparently the social worker. I didn\u2019t really understand the reasoning behind it.", "No my wife is friends with the social worker through her job. We were emergency foster carers for a while before our son came to us. My brother used to joke that she took advantage of us but we didn\u2019t see it that way. We had to keep our son for longer than normal due to circumstances and fell in love with him. Neither of us wanted him to leave and we definitely weren\u2019t guilted into it.", "I was thinking about this too, OP, OP's wife and OP's brother all bunch of teenagers having kids", "I had three of my own and a bonus kid by the year I turned 25. And two of my kids are Irish twins, barely a year between them.\n\nNTA OP", "NTA. But honestly, it sounds like OP is punishing them for bad ideas without regard to how it affects your children and his. The better response would be for all four of you to meet, for you to address their hurtful, mean-spirited view of things head on, and if they still don\u2019t get it because they are shallow or unempathetic, to say they can believe what they want but if they ever say it in front of either of you or the kids again or even if they say it to a third party who repeats it to you or your kids, you are done with them.", "My brother hasn\u2019t.

Was just a one on one conversation between his wife and SIL.", "It was the sil who said it and not in front of the kids.", "My ex SIL is still bringing the boys to mine. This was already arranged. My wife and ex SIL are good friends so she is coming here on Christmas Eve, leaving the boys here and my brother was supposed to be coming on Christmas Day. I also know that my SIL wouldn\u2019t of thought that without my brothers involvement so that\u2019s why I\u2019m angry with him", "He only apologized because there were consequences. OP doesn't owe it to his brother to let him come over for the holiday.", "He didn\u2019t apologize straight away. He defended her and said she was right to ask if she wanted too. He only apologized after I said that getting together at Christmas didn\u2019t seem the best idea", "Sure curiosity is fine if they had stopped before asking if they were guilted into it. But that was out of line.", "But Ops brother only apologized after OP uninvited him and SIL from christmas. Before he doubled down on it and even implied that the kid was probably thinking the same. I would not believe his apology to be genuine. \n\nAnd ops brother knew the kid for 6 years most likely. If he had this question, why not ask earlier? Like during the adoption process where these questions can actually be helpful. Something is fishy and I would not trust my brother/SIL not to say something infront of the kids.", "Why? Unless there's a concern about the treatment of the child, why is it anybodys business? \n\nWould you expect a couple to justify why they chose to have a biological child?", "\u201cWe wanted to adopt.\u201d  Period.  That\u2019s all the explanation family members need.  (Unless they\u2019ve got reason to believe the kid is being mistreated, but then there are more immediate concerns to deal with than anyone\u2019s motivations.)  What matters is that the kid is here and part of the family, and should be embraced as such.  Or do you think it\u2019s appropriate to go around interrogating people on their biological reproductive choices, too?", "Let\u2019s see if I have gathered the facts: \n\n1) you are hosting Christmas\n\n2) your nephews are staying the night at your house regardless of your brother as his ex, your wife\u2019s friend, is bringing the kids and they are spending the night. The kid custody exchange was to take place at your house. \n\n3) your wife\u2019s friend, different friend, is a social worker. Y\u2019all fostered your youngest, grew to love him, legally included him in your family. \n\n4) six months ago your brother, with his new wife of two years, moves back to the area. \n\n5) prior to going to lunch SIL drops a bombshell thought process asking if you were guilted into adopting. \n\n6) brother doubles down defending his wife\u2019s insensitive inquiry And claiming that the child has already heard this speculation. \n\n7) upset and concerned that your child will be exposed, by them, to this viral infection of questioning one\u2019s self worth and place in the family you disinvite the brother and his wife from Christmas. The nephews are still coming as planned. \n\n8) your brother apologizes at this point to no avail, even tries to come alone so he can spend time with his sons.\n\nOP, the concern is valid regarding your youngest, but might the nephews be the spreaders of this noxious speculation? This seems to be a topic of discussion in your bother\u2019s world. Is it even possible to expect they were discreet? \n\nA family meeting might be in order to solidify the situation and put the speculation to rest. Unfortunately an explanation is needed for these insensitive beings. Your nephews may need to be included if they could be infected and spreading the vile rumors. I am wondering how else would your child have already been exposed? For those considering the speculation to be idle and harmless\u2026 questions like this can destroy a child\u2019s world, denying them the safety and security of their family unit by making them feel less than, Other-than, and unloved and unlovable. \n\nIn regards to your brother, his children, and Christmas\u2026 maybe other arrangements need to be made so he is able to have his children for the holiday.\n\nOP, Best wishes for the best life for you and your entire family.
