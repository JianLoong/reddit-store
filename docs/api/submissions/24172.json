{"id": 24172, "submission_id": "15lcnfg", "title": "AITA for expecting my parents to pay me back for paying for my sisters drinks and food over a weekend?", "selftext": "For context I (24) live in Ireland. My sister (22) is studying in Dublin. My gf (25) lives in Dublin and I live about an hour drive away from there. One weekend I was planning on visiting her and as it happened my sister had to go to Dublin on the same day to collect something from her apartment as she was starting work placement in the hospital where we live. Most people in Ireland work a part time job while they are doing work placement for college but my sister has decided she doesn\u2019t want to do this. As a result she has no money and instead our parents just give her money when she needs it. Since my sister needed to go to Dublin and I was going anyway I was asked to give her a lift which was fair enough. My girlfriend wanted to be nice to her and invited her over for a cup of tea. What was supposed to be a simple lift up to Dublin turned into my sister tagging along with me and my girlfriend and us buying her drinks and food all weekend. Eventually myself and my gf were getting a bit fed up with the whole thing and agreed that we weren\u2019t going to spend any more money on her. My sister then asked me when was I driving back home as she was starting her college placement tomorrow. I told her I was staying another night with my girlfriend as I did not have work until later in the week. Her response was well that\u2019s not very convenient for me to which I told her that was her problem. There are plenty of busses and trains she could have gotten home. When I arrived home I told my parents about the situation and they didn\u2019t want to hear any of it. They said I should just be happy to be able to be nice to my sister even if she is rude to me and that I shouldn\u2019t expect anything in return. My argument is that I was taken advantage of as I thought all I would be doing was giving my sister a lift to Dublin, not paying for her entire weekend.

Good life lesson: don\u2019t spend money on people who have no income to speak of unless you\u2019re ok with never seeing that money again.", "NTA per se, but did it occur to you to just \"not\" pay for her stuff? This is a weird post. No one had a conversation about how long she'd be staying or where and you paid for her all weekend, knowing she has no money (so not addressing it with the people who give her money beforehand)?", "For the exact question I would say, yes YTA\n\nThe whole deal was to give your sister a lift and that's it. You shouldn't pay for your sister and just assume, that your parents pay you back.\n\nYour sister should pay you back, not your parents.", "YTA. You started buying her shit knowing that she didn't have money and then got mad when you had to keep buying her shit? You opened the door and then got mad the door was open.", "ESH.  YTA because you didn't have to pay for her stuff and it's wild that you are expecting your parents to pay you back.  You chose to allow her to tag along.  Your sister is the AH for expecting everyone else to pay for her.  And you ALL are assholes for not communicating.  If your parents usually pay, they should have sent $$ with your sister if that is how things work in your family.  You also could have freaking talked to your sister and asked about her money situation or told your gf that you didn't want your sister along because you would spend the weekend paying for crap.  This is a completely self made problem.", "ESH \n\nYour sister should be old enough to pay for her own shit. \n\nBut if I understand correctly you could\u2019ve just given her a lift and said no when your sister wanted to tag along to other stuff after your gf first invited her. \n\nIt was your decision to let her tag along not your parents\u2019", "YTA you paid for a bunch of stuff for your sister then decided your parents owe you money without ever consulting them? Lol take a look in the mirror", "YTA for the specific question you\u2019ve asked.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t be the AH for asking your sister to pay you back (or better yet, having had that discussion the first time she tagged along before you even paid for her).

But I\u2019d also say just get over it and never do it again.", "NTA - you were nice enough to even pay for her food/drinks and all you did was set a healthy boundary.

She seems quite entitled and your parents are just encouraging it at this point.", "I won't say you are, but there is a tough lesson here. Don't expect anyone to pay you back unless you have that conversation up front. Not everyone thinks they have to pay you back when you start shelling out money. Some will even go overboard because they aren't paying for it. \n\nI understand your parents usually pay the bill, but that should have been a conversation beforehand. Also, the ride back should have been discussed before she even went.  There should always be a conversation about when you are leaving and expecting to come back. \n\nI think you were happy about it until a certain point and it sounds like your GF decided it was enough and then it became a problem. You got caught up in the weekend and now you are out some money. Write it up to lessons learned.", "NTA she totally played upon your good nature and she sounds like she does it a lot with everyone and this is your family dynamic.

So next time it\u2019ll be your fault if you don\u2019t learn from this and set a boundary. This time you\u2019re the nice guy.", "NTA for expecting to be paid back, but now you know you aren't, it's time to give up.\n\nLesson learned: ask first when it comes to your parents and money, and never do your sister a favour.", "NTA - your parents need to quit babying your sister.  She needs to grow up and take responsibility for herself.", "NTA. Sis needs a crash course in responsibility.", "NTA\n\nYou offered a ride, not being her personal bank account", "NAH if you never clarified \"hey, I'm just giving you a ride into Dublin; we aren't hosting you for the weekend or anything.\" She was acting entitled, but you need to speak up for yourself. And ask HER to pay you back, not your parents! She gets money from them when she needs it - well, she needs it to pay for her \"holiday\" in Dublin.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re the asshole for expecting your parents to pay you back when it was entirely your idea to invite her to stay for the weekend and pay for her. She probably thought you were being a nice sibling and were paying for her due to being in a better financial position. If you didn\u2019t tell her \u201cyou have to pay me back\u201d, why would she think she had to? You\u2019re family. And you seems a bit dismissive when saying \u201cmost people work a part time job while they are doing work placement for college but my sister has decided she doesn\u2019t want to do this\u201d- nursing work placements are notoriously long and tiring and from what I understand she has to continue studying  while doing this. \n\nAlso was the original agreement that you\u2019d take her to Dublin and back? I get that you\u2019re annoyed that she expected that but maybe there was a miscommunication somewhere and she thought you were taking her both ways.", "Feel like we need more information. \nDid you originally plan to come back on the same day she planned to and then out of the blue change your plan? \n\nWhy did you pay for her to begin with?\n\nWhat was discussed before you agreed to all this? \n\nWhy did you let her tag along after the lift? You could have said no unless she has money? \n\nShe\u2019s in higher education doing what I can only guess is a medical degree? That costs a lot of money and I\u2019m guessing she wants to do well and having a part time job can cause un-needed stress. \n\nWhat your parents pay out for her is not really your concern at the end of the day\n\nHowever it is not your job to pay for her either. \n\nMaybe set up boundaries and limits next time so your sister knows what to expect and plan accordingly.\n\nYou were happy to pay for her at the beginning without an agreement with your parents that they would be paying you back. \n\nThis feels more like you became spiteful throughout the time spent with your sister and now you wished you never paid for her to begin with. \n\nYou will be the A if you expect your parents to pay you back.\n\nYou won\u2019t be the A if you accept the loss this time but let everyone know your expectations next time something like this happens.", "ESH. Yes, she was taking advantage of you. No, you cannot just decide to un-gift food and drinks that you bought for her.", "I don't understand. Why you can't afford to feed your sister for one weekend? Are you poor?", "you sound like a cheap asshole imo", "Do you not like your sister? Because my sister always fights me to pay the bill when we go out to eat.\nIt sounds like maybe you resent her because your parents are supporting her. \nI do think that YTA because no one asked you to buy her anything.", "YTA.

You can't just give someone stuff and expect it to be paid for later.\nJeez, I would never dream of asking my parents to pay for anything, and ive probably spent 100k+ on them since I moved out a long time ago, on top of the odd day taken off of work and often sat or Sunday helping them out with things that they are no longer able to do. And I don't earn much over minimum wage.\nIt's called humanity. Your parents looked after your sorry arse for 16+ years...", "NTA, this was just communication issues. You made a few perfectly reasonable assumptions, but they didn't pan out like you expected. Your sister didn't seem to have a plan for herself for a place to stay or food, but it also doesn't seem like you said anything about her needing to bring money. That being said, being asked for a ride and paying a weekend's worth of room and board is not what you agreed to.\n\nHonestly I don't know what you could have done that wouldn't have upset someone though.
