My sister (22) is studying in Dublin. My gf (25) lives in Dublin and I live about an hour drive away from there. One weekend I was planning on visiting her and as it happened my sister had to go to Dublin on the same day to collect something from her apartment as she was starting work placement in the hospital where we live. Most people in Ireland work a part time job while they are doing work placement for college but my sister has decided she doesn\u2019t want to do this. As a result she has no money and instead our parents just give her money when she needs it. Since my sister needed to go to Dublin and I was going anyway I was asked to give her a lift which was fair enough. My girlfriend wanted to be nice to her and invited her over for a cup of tea. What was supposed to be a simple lift up to Dublin turned into my sister tagging along with me and my girlfriend and us buying her drinks and food all weekend. Eventually myself and my gf were getting a bit fed up with the whole thing and agreed that we weren\u2019t going to spend any more money on her. My sister then asked me when was I driving back home as she was starting her college placement tomorrow. I told her I was staying another night with my girlfriend as I did not have work until later in the week. Her response was well that\u2019s not very convenient for me to which I told her that was her problem. There are plenty of busses and trains she could have gotten home. When I arrived home I told my parents about the situation and they didn\u2019t want to hear any of it. They said I should just be happy to be able to be nice to my sister even if she is rude to me and that I shouldn\u2019t expect anything in return. My argument is that I was taken advantage of as I thought all I would be doing was giving my sister a lift to Dublin, not paying for her entire weekend.

Or her plans other than picking up something from the apartment? Because you sure could have picked up the whatever for her. It's crazy she wanted one thing but had no plans for the rest of the trip. Btw, lesson learned, never open your wallet without knowing if you will be paid back. Family rarely expects to return payment unless you discuss that in advance.", "Here's why YTA.  You left her stranded.  How the hell did you think she was going to get back?  You knew you were her ride.  Was there a discussion about her return?  I'm sure she assumed she was getting a ride back with you.  Did you tell her before hand that you wouldn't be back in time for her to start work?", "I agree with this,  op should be treating this as sisters' debt to be collected.

How do you live life assuming", " One weekend I was planning on visiting her and as it happened my sister had to go to Dublin on the same day to collect something from her apartment as she was starting work placement in the hospital where we live.\n\nHow is collecting something from her apartment there for work placement where you are come down to assuming she was going to stay.\n\nFFS", "Yes my girlfriend wanted to be nice to her not me. I thought I was being nice enough by driving her up in the first place to her own apartment. As for her staying in Dublin, I drove her up on the Sunday and her placement started the following Tuesday so she had plenty of time to organise a bus or a train home. She never asked me for a lift home so how was I to know? She more or less just assumed I would drive her back home at the expense of spending time with my gf.", "I never assumed she was going to stay, I assumed she would organise her own transport home as she had never asked me for a lift back home.", "So in the while drive you couldn't think to ask a reasonable question? Can yoy think for yourself that she might not have the cash to arrange a lift back? Is communication that complicated that it easier to assume?", "Dude she\u2019s 22 I\u2019m not her babysitter. Whenever she needs money my parents just give it to her anyway. Why was I to assume this would be different when she never asked me for a lift back until the point that she wanted to go home?", "Because it is basic logic to ask, but that seems lacking here because you assume your parents owe you for YOUR choices. \n\nIs there any logic to ASKING, she is just as wrong for assuming but fuck me the total lack of communication is baffling", "Yeah, I get that this is really frustrating but your parents don't owe you anything; you were the person who allowed your sister to batten on you all weekend. But take heart! It's a relatively inexpensive lesson in polite assertiveness which you can deploy next time she asks for a lift to Dublin! :)", "NTA. Setting boundaries means nothing if you aren't consistent.  SHe's your sister not your minor child therefore you have no responsibility to provide for her. One meal, thats you being nice. Them EXPECTING you to support her is not nice or even morally right. So STOP DOING IT!!", "NTA, because you are not responsible for her. She\u2019s a grown adult and should be taking care of herself. I had my first job at the age of 14 and so on, I even worked full time during college. Never once expected my family to help me what so ever.

Do they manage your spending?", "When I say manage her spending, I just mean she doesn\u2019t work or have any money of her own so they just give her money when she needs it.", "No, they helped me out through college and stuff but I always had a part time job throughout. I\u2019m working full time now.", "YTA. If you expected to only drop her off at her apartment then why didn\u2019t you do that?\n\n\u201cOk, later sis.\u201d You watch to make sure she gets in safely, then drive off. \n\nYour girlfriend chose to invite her over for tea. Then you guys chose to let her come out with you. Then you chose to pay for everything. How is that anyone\u2019s fault but yours?", "I'm going to go with ESH. OP you needed to communicate cleary about expectations next time. Your sister \"guilt tripping\" you is your fault. Unless you are broke chalk it up as a learning experience. If you are broke stand up for yourself (and plan better) next time. I personally would have been very clear upfront because I'm guessing the girlfriend was upset about the 3rd wheel and not as much the money", "If there's a next time, you set a limit on what you pay or give her cash and let her know that's it.  Any more past that she has to pay you back.", "It was not the original plan. But he and his girlfriend allowed it. They didn\u2019t have to let her tag along."]}
