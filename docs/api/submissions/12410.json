Abusive people are typically very charming at first and then they GRADUALLY increase the abuse, typically that happens after the wedding, during pregnancy or when the abuser feels secure enough that you aren't going to run away or tell on them.\n\nFrom what this looks like to me is like gradually increasing abuse where he is now getting you accustomed to him being in control and establishing that you are in the servant role. \n\nWhat he did was a PURE POWER PLAY to demonstrate to you that he is in control and that there is nothing you can do about it.

To your husband you don't deserve equal respect and consideration to him. \n\nBELIEVE HIM. This behavior is only going to get worse and worse.
