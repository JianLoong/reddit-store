Were best friends and stayed that way till junior year of college. I was Claire\u2019s fat friend and she was the popular one. I was fed up with Claire after she picked the same college as me. The friend dynamic was getting old and so were her \u201cproblems\u201d. Her problems were boy issues or drama with other popular girls. I got sick of acting like a therapist and having to deal with all of that. \n\nMy junior year of college I lost weight and wanted to rebrand myself. I befriended a woman who told me other women were intimidated by my friendship with Claire. I told Claire I wanted to do my own thing and she handled it horribly. First she refused, would blast my phone all the time, then posted stuff on social media, then blocked me and told the parents. I was having more success with women and didn\u2019t really want to go back. Then she wouldn\u2019t leave my friends alone. These were my friends and she always hung around them, show up to bars we were at or invite them places without me. I stopped hanging out with that friend group because of the awkwardness.

I told her to not put any more drinks on the tab as it wasn\u2019t for her. She apologized and then as I turned to leave she said \u201cwhatever douche\u201d under her breath. I didn\u2019t speak to her the rest of the night till 20 minutes before I left and our parents were gone. Her friend comes up to me saying Claire is hammered and wants me to take her home. I laughed and said not a shot. Claire comes over and ask if I would give her a ride home since I was staying at my parents that night and her parents live next door. I said no, I\u2019m not putting a drunk girl in my car, especially you since you called me a douche earlier. told her to call an Uber. She said she would pay me to do it. I said \u201csounds like you can pay for an Uber then\u201d. She said something about me changing for the worse. It ticked me off and I said \u201cyou are a hot girl I\u2019m sure you will be able to find a ride home.\u201d I drove home.

The answer is NTA.", "NTA, the lady Claire does sound like one nasty piece of work and after all that she has done to you, its not your problem with whatever she is upto.

That was the best decision you made that day.  Sounds like she has a thing for you and was trying everything to get you alone for whatever reasons.   Be prepared for her wrath - it\u2019s coming.", "NTA, that was the smart, responsible choice.", "YTA. It seems like you had an issue with her from the beginning for being skinny and popular. You seem to be trying to make it seem like she treated you badly like the movies where the popular best friend doesn\u2019t treat the \u201cfat\u201d or \u201cugly\u201d friend badly but she didn\u2019t seem to do that. \n\nBesides all that, you live right next door.

She seems like the type that would claim anything just for the drama and attention.  Of course, that's only based off of what you claim she has done in the past.  So if she's as bad as you claim...you made the right call not to put her in your car.\n\nHOWEVER, you aren't in the right either because you had multiple options to make sure she didn't drunk-drive and you didn't take them.  You could have taken her keys and called the Uber for her.  You could have called her parents to come back and get her themselves.  You could have called any mutual friends.  Literally taking her keys and telling them they'd be waiting for her in her mailbox would have been a bare minimum even if you did nothing else to help her get home.\n\nNo matter how you feel about her now, this is a someone you grew up with and your parents are still best friends with her parents.  Protect yourself, but still be a decent human.", "YTA.  Frankly, you don\u2019t point to a single thing Claire did wrong before you ditched her as a friend, other than the undertone of resentment that she didn\u2019t want to fuck you.  But then when you lost weight and figured you could get other girls to fuck you, you decided to become a total dick to her. \n\nNone of that is impressive.", "**This is what I am reading here:  You are being vindictive just to be vindictive.**\n\nYou can make a choice, we get to say no, but I do think you're an AH in the sense that you could have cared more about your friend, despite it.    Sometimes it's just right to be a human first.  You can make better choices.\n\nBoth of you are behaving badly and no one is being honest about it.  You point the finger at her, she points the finger at you, everyone gets passive aggressive.\n\nYou were not obligated and that's on you, but it doesn't mean you can't help someone out.\n\nLook, Claire's behavior was not appropriate, but if we get down to the nitty gritty, it was a drunk person needing a ride home.\n\nI think that is just called human decency.\n\nObviously there are issues between the two of you that have not been communicated at all.\n\nI am going to go on a limb here and say Claire felt closer to you as a friend and then you just up and left.  She may be behaving erratically because of her own emotions.  She's probably angry in some capacity because whatever reason, usually it's because one person feels one way about the relationship that the other doesn't.\n\nI think what it boils down too is human decency.  Despite her baggage, it's the human thing to do to give a drunk person a ride home.\n\nI think you could have treated her better, even if you don't care.\n\nPut that aside and help a human get home, and if you didn't want to take her yourself, at least call her an uber or her parents.  She's drunk, I don't think she can function.  It's just the right thing to do and you could have put your own feelings aside, just once.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We don't know if it is.\n\nI guess I am just trying to say, despite all that, despite it all, sometimes we can just choose to do something human for the sake of it.\n\nHe didn't have too.  His call.\n\nI think what I am saying is that in lieu of that, she is someone he has known a very long time and even though her behavior was not appropriate, he could have also chosen to help her.\n\nHer behavior was not OK, in that situation.  I get that.\n\nWhat is the reason for her behavior?\n\nHe could have just done it for the sake of it.  If it was someone he didn't know would that change the decision?\n\nBe human first, that is all I am saying.\n\nIf you see someone struggling you can always make your choice and that's totally legit, but you can also choose to care.\n\nYou don't have to be vindictive to be vindictive.", "Yup, he could have taken her home in his car, and then get accused of rape or sexual assault.

We don't really know that.  He may have just not wanted to take her because he was annoyed and yeah that's a choice.  Do whatever man, he can do that.\n\nThis person isn't a stranger to him so I didn't actually think that at first, I didn't think she would do that.\n\nSo my decision is made on the idea that they know each other enough that I can't assume that is an issue they have.\n\nHe didn't have too, but he could have, and that's all that is.", "We can't really assume that can we?  Do we know enough about their relationships and dynamic to conclude that she WILL do something like that or IS IT implied?\n\nI think it is implied because you have already decided that she will behave that way, regardless, when I don't think we can predict someone else's behavior at all.\n\nIs that really really a risk?  Has she done that before?  Can we assume that honestly, they have been family friends.\n\nIs it an option, sure, but does OP really feel like that is going to happen?  How can we assume something we don't know?\n\nHe didn't have to do anything, he didn't.\n\nAll I am saying is, he could have been a person first and just did it regardless because that is what a human would do.\n\nIf you don't care you don't care and that just is.  He doesn't have too.\n\nI just think he could have handled it better.  There is more than one way to solve a problem.", "Sure, that's a valid thought.  This is all speculation, but  I think her behavior is indicative of the fact that she does care about him, I do believe that is true.  She's behaving erratically and impulsively, potentially due to the fact that he did blow her off.  I can imagine that has a lot of hurt in it for her.\n\nIt is on HER to manage and cope with her emotions without hurting others. That is her responsibility.\n\nI think both of them are really pointing the finger at each other and being passive aggressive about it, but in that sense, she needed help, and in this case, we have no idea who helped her get home.  Hopefully she didn't drive.", "Family friends until they had a falling out, where she showed how horrible she could get, and from what we've been told I wouldn't put it behind her, given the fact that she already made false accusations about him before.\n\nAnd yes, he could have, but she could have not insulted him either. She created her own problem, not him.\n\nTo be fair though, he sound like a huge jerk, but in this case taking her home would have been a huge risk on him, and he was right to refuse, not to mention the fact that she insulted him.", "I don't think drunk people actually have the capacity to reason honestly.  I think this is just about the benefit of the doubt.\n\nIf that was a risk for OP than he knew that, and him saying no takes that into consideration.\n\nHe did say no.  So no question about that.\n\nWas he a jerk as you said.\n\nI think so.\n\nThat's just what I think.  What is done is done, he didn't do it, he didn't have too, no problem, everything is already over.\n\nIs he an asshole for this?  I mean, it depends on how you look at it.\n\nIf he was being a jerk to be a jerk he could have done better.\n\nIf he was protecting himself based on information only he knows and we assume, than he was right to make that decision.\n\nIn that sense he could have called an Uber for her, or called her parents for her considering she didn't have the capacity to do that as a drunk person.  He didn't even ask other people to help her either and that's kind of odd. He could have at least asked the friends or done anything at all.  That can also be a human thing to do.", "Their friends were also here to call an uber, and while a drunk person of course is less capable, well, no one forced her to drink, being responsible is on her, that's not everyone else role.\n\nYou don't need to get wasted to have fun, OP sounds like he had a great time and yet he was able to take his car by the end of the night.\n\nBeing human is good, but there is a difference between being human and obeying someone who insulted you just because they were unresponsible on top of being disrespectful.\n\nAlso remember that he is the one paying for her alcohol since she put it on his tab, so I'd say he already did plenty for her this night.", "I am not sure where the obey comes in?\n\nI don't think she told him he had obey her?\n\nThere are a million other ways this could have been handled, yes.  \n\nI think it is OK to give people the benefit of the doubt, which it sounds like you do not want to do for this and that's cool if that is what you think.  Life happens, it's fluid, we make mistakes, we make bad decisions, we learn, we grow.  That's just life.\n\nI  just think differently and that is OK.

It seems he was a closer friend to her than she was to him, and that rejection made her react in a way that makes her weird as hell.
