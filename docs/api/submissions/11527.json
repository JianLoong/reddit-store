So many people get no paid leave, and risk losing their jobs if they take unpaid leave.", "This is a work issue, not a home and family issue.  Does your spouse have input on how you conduct your work day?  You're making an assumption that the wife will pick up the slack. It's more likely that daycare will pick up the slack.  \n\nAny new parent who thinks they can wfh and take care of a baby at the same time is not planning well.  The wife should not be counting on it either unless her job is very very flexible.  It's very fair to take people's work abilities into account here.", "Mother has maternity leave. She won't be working at home for quite a period. Unless she wants to give him paternity leave, which I doubt.", "In UK, shared parental leave is when the mother transfers some of her maternity leave allowance to the father. He says he's availing of that, so I'd guess that she will be taking off three to six months and then he will be taking off six months. It's the initial, newborn stage when he is wanting to work in the office. The time when baby does nothing but eat, sleep, poop, cry. Pretty distracting if I'm honest. And he says he isn't expecting her to work from home while he's on leave."]}
