That\u2019s his choice.\n\nHowever, if he wasn\u2019t getting what he needed out of his work environment I\u2019d be 100% behind him going back to the office. \n\nYou need to do what\u2019s best for your work, when you\u2019re paid to be at work, and it sounds like wfh is not the best thing for your mental health either.", "NTA - I WFH and my adult children bug the shit out of me. You need to have space and lack of interruption.", "NTA. And people notice the person who is \"WFH\" whilst also looking after a child. They're performance lacks.", "NAH. But put child plans on hold until you figure this out together.", "NTA - but if a parcel arrives during a work call and this stresses you out - I strongly think you should reconsider having a child.  Nothing is more disruptive and chaotic than a wee one.  If this isn't in your realm of coping - you really should rethink having a baby.  Have you spent time with young children?  Is there someone's children you can babysit and take care of so you know you have the capacity to cope? Good luck.", "I would work on your anxiety before having a child. Having a screaming baby at any hour of the day is extremely anxiety inducing. Also, commuting might mean you are more tired overall and I doubt you would be contributing more.", "I am actually gonna say NAH based on your edit. Sounds like you have a rough plan that ensures someone is at home able to focus on caring for the child for the first full year, which is the biggest potential issue.\n\nI think your wife was just expecting more support when she was on leave, likely because that is what she was planning to do during your leave, but I do not think that obligates you to risk your job performance when she has no other responsibilities besides caring for the child.\n\nThat being said, I think you also need to realize the tradeoff that will happen here. You not being able to switch from task to task is fine, but in lieu of doing those tasks during the workday you should expect to do them after. I think sitting down with your wife and getting a rough idea of what each day would look like would be a good plan, and whoever is caring for the kid during the day needs at least an hour or two off from being responsible for them.", "NTA but as a parent who has worked from home for years, if you have a traditional job with set hours, you cannot wfh and care for children at the same time. Wfh does not negate the need to line up adequate childcare (either in home with the other parent or a nanny) or daycare. This needs to be taken into account in these discussions with your wife.", "NTA I can\u2019t work from home either. It\u2019s way too full of distractions. Child care was invented for a reason. If she likes it that\u2019s fine but no one should be obligated. Good that you\u2019re talking this out now.", "Stop trying for a baby until you have this all sorted out.", "NTA. I think your plan is a good one. My kids are grown and out of the house now, but I remember what it\u2019s like caring for babies. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to work and care for them at the same time. They require too much attention as babies. You\u2019d have to sacrifice one of your roles: you\u2019d be a great parent but a mediocre employee, or vice versa.", "We do not allow parents with young children to work from home without having alternate childcare arrangements.", "Please consider if you really need a child in your life. You don\u2019t seem to be ready. YTA", "YWBTAH bringing a child into the world without having everything worked out. I highly doubt you and your wife have everything worked out. You and your wife need to sit down and talk about everything before even thinking of having a kid.", "NTA.  With your attention and reading issues, you need a specific structure to excel.  That is just reality.  Your wife is really this upset just discussing how to handle being parents?  This, unfortunately, is a huge red flag.  You need to start sorting this out, maybe with a therapist, before you get pregnant.  Bringing a baby into the mix before you are in agreement on how to handle things will not make it better.  Work on yourselves first, please.", "Corporate shill", "ES\n\n\"dyslexia and dyspraxia which causes me to really struggle with context switching. If I'm in the middle of a work call and there is a knock on the door with a parcel I get more stressed out than most people would\" - \n\nI'm not sure the plan for you to be a parent is going to work out.  Certainly the whole 'minding a small child on your own' should be tried before you are 100% committed to this project.  The reason minding small children is so exhausting is because its nothing but switching from A to B to X to Y\n\nI suspect that when you are doing your time at home, you will discover you dont have the capacity to do the parenting you are committed to.", "NTA however these are questions that need to be resolved *before* you have a child", "Maybe stop trying to have a baby . And get divorced instead .", "NTA, you both can\u2019t work from home full-time and take care of your baby that\u2019s cheating your boss and stealing time. I\u2019d look for either a daycare situation and choose that one of you quit your job or go part time. There\u2019s no way to work full-time and work from home taking care of a baby. My husband worked from home the first year with our baby, but I was a stay at home mom. He only watch the baby when she was taking a nap and I was getting a shower. Otherwise I have responsibility for the baby.", "Something I didn\u2019t realise before having kids is that they go to bed really early. Bed time is around 7pm. Meaning that if you work 9-6 in the office you won\u2019t be home until 6.30 if you\u2019re lucky to get off at 6pm. That gives you roughly 30 minutes with a tired baby per day. Point is, you might feel different when you have a baby. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone is TA here, fact is you\u2019re trying to sort it out before she\u2019s even pregnant. Well done you. As some ppl suggested, therapy might be a good investment now and save you some headaches in the future.", "NTA. Some people can work from home successfully, and some can\u2019t. A lot of people can\u2019t really work from home with small children in the mix; it\u2019s just that some aren\u2019t willing to admit it. Your wife can\u2019t have lived her whole life assuming she\u2019d have a WFH coparent, because no one ever thought that was realistic before 2020. Furthermore, she knows who she married. She signed up for this. She\u2019s going to have to adjust her expectations. And meanwhile, you two should stop trying to conceive. I realize neither of you is young at this point and you may be anxious to get started, but you\u2019re not on the same page and that\u2019s going to make the postpartum period, which is already unimaginably difficult, even worse.", "NTA.  Certain circumstances are just not conducive to working from home, whether they have to do with the nature of the work, the hours, not having a good space dedicated to working, or other reasons.  But all of this assumes that you are, in fact, working while at home. It is why the pandemic was disastrous for so many parents - they had to work at home while also managing childcare (because their usual childcare options were not available).  I do not understand your wife\u2019s views, unless she thinks that you will also be looking after the child while working at home.  Which is a big no-no even in the best of circumstances, but especially so in yours.\n\nYou both need to walk through the details of this so you can be on the same page, including why she feels you would be rejecting her and the family.  Literally billions of people worked outside of the home pre-pandemic and I don\u2019t think anybody would say that that in and of itself was a rejection of their partners or families.  The other issue is why your mental health shouldn\u2019t be your priority - as your partner, she should be concerned about how all this will affect you. That she is not (absolutely or relatively) is a pretty major flag.  But either way, these types of issues all need to be discussed at length before you even start the process of having a child.", "But they don't have the child yet, they aren't even pregnant, and they are literally trying to figure these things out now.", "Especially not with a newborn. After the 1st or 2nd year, its much more doable, but under 1 there is no chance of you being able to focus on both effectively.\n\nIf your job lets you dick around, then maybe its doable, but if you actually need to work more than 2-3 hours a day then its not really possible to do both.", "It could also be that he\u2019s adding an extra hour a day to his absence. I wfh and the extra time in the morning and night with my kids is something I cherish. She might be wondering why he\u2019s adding extra time to his absence when she personally believes she\u2019d do the opposite in his position. \n\nThey need to talk about where they are both coming from. Does he expect constant interruptions when she\u2019s planning to leave him alone during the day unless the house is on fire? Is she thinking that he should want to cuddle the baby (and give her a pee break) during lunch while he\u2019s concerned more with not being distracted for the rest of his day? Who\u2019s taking nights, the person on leave so they\u2019re on call most of the time with only a few hours in the evening to have shared duties? Or are they going to share? If OP is taking the second six months it\u2019s possible that the baby will be sleeping through the night by then so his wife may be looking at doing her leave while sleep deprived and therefore feels it\u2019s not fair he\u2019s trying to stay away even more instead of wanting to prioritise home time when he can. \n\nThey need to talk.", "My company had parents with young children who were willing to wear N95 masks for 9+ hours per day rather than stay home with their kids once offices here were allowed to reopen with some mask requirements.", "This made me laugh. \ud83d\ude02 So so accurate.", "Depends what his job is I guess. I stopped seeing my therapist because she had a baby in early lockdown and decided she preferred WFH after restrictions lifted. Had another kid and shared childcare/leave/WFH with spouse like OP here.\n\nShe went from reliable and professional to constant rescheduling, being late, disruptions and utterly detrimental to what I paid her for. She lost nearly 90% of her clients because mixing certain jobs WFH with an infant cared for by someone else in a mid sized London flat doesn\u2019t work well.\n\nHeadphones did not help because her mind was on the kids and spouse and it was noticeable. But she had wanted to save commute. She lost her business. And frankly considering how much it impacted her ability to do her job safely I don\u2019t have massive sympathy because it had devastating consequences for my mental health.\n\nSo it might be that OP simply doesn\u2019t have a job that makes this feasible. Also not sure people are realising how small a mid sized London flat is. There isn\u2019t necessarily a lot of buffer to have separate WFH areas that do not get interruption and be in breach of contract.\n\nWanting to keep your job and do it well is not avoiding your child. Children need attention when you are with them but you can\u2019t give them attention 24/7 and not drop the ball on the adult stuff that keeps you clothed, fed and housed.", "Neither parent should be looking after the child is they are working from home.", "Yeah this stuck out to me. I honestly think everyone should have some form of therapy before even beginning to try to have a child. Like, you're raising another person and everything about you will affect how that person grows up. OP absolutely should look into it. Getting stressed out when you get interrupted is something incompatible with being a decent parent. It does not sound like they thought about it much at all", "This!", "In Canada we get 18 months that can be shared maternity/paternity leave with 12 of those being supported with maternity insurance/partial wages. Small business owners and independent contractors do get this but employees do. I cannot imagine having to leave an infant at home and am grateful.", "Exactly. Feels like they are doing exactly what they are being recommended to do.", "A good licensed marriage and family therapist is a great way to guide those conversations without them turning into a huge overreaction. \n\neg. You don\u2019t want to work from home with an infant in the house? Well then you must hate me & our future family! \n\nHaving an impartial party to facilitate those conversations, help them get on the same page about parenting, and get them to discuss issues they haven\u2019t even considered yet is a great idea for people who are planning to bring life into the world.", "I've really tried working from home while bf takes care of the babe, but damn. It's hard. Every screech, every cry, and I'm distracted from my work. As a result I'm constantly having to work overtime to catch up, so while OP might be lighting time on fire by commuting, the same may be said when it comes to wfh. Just a thought I want to throw into the mix here from us scramble-brains.", "So for that long, neither of them have any need to work without childcare... the other one is the childcare.", "This is ridiculous, they have already nailed down the childcare arrangements. They don\u2019t need to \u201cfigure this out\u201d, he will be working, it\u2019s not about whether he needs to be there just which workspace he uses.", "It sounds as if you've also got other reasons why it would be (and is already) especially difficult.", "For real. I don\u2019t understand the folks who are so adverse to therapy", "It makes a huge difference.", "I wouldn't say no one. I went back to my office and took my baby with me and didn't have problems.", "You don't want to find out partway through that 9 months that you aren't prepared to compromise.", "But they\u2019re currently trying. We don\u2019t know how long they\u2019ve been trying and 6 months is an average. It could happen at any time. Then they\u2019ve got the stress of working this out.", "Well, I assumed that the issue from his wife was that he would be leaving when she will be at home with the kid in mat leave, so pretty pointless what they'll be doing later. Also it should be a rule that kid at home while WFH only if you have a dedicated carer (a parent that comes and interrupts often wouldn't be acceptable in my opinion)", "Tbh, I just assumed no one would make this big a deal over a, what, 6 month arrangement? But I forget the amount of dramatic people out there."]}
