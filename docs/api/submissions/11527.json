Whether this be with childcare or day to day chores....", "Which would be sensible,  but doesn't sound like the plan considering he thinks the kid being at home will stop him working.", "So why would the baby be distracting him from working at home if the baby is in childcare? Seems pretty obvious who's going to be looking after the kid", "I don\u2019t see it as selfish.\n\nHe\u2019d be a bad worker if he got severely distracted by household things at work, and a bad family member if he got severely distracted by work while at home.  Separation is the best way for him to do both things since he\u2019s not neurotypical.  Or he risks losing his job or losing his family.  And even typical folks often need that separation.\n\nHe said he\u2019ll use six months of paternity leave and explicitly said he\u2019d expect his wife to work then and Not be working from home either.  Not selfish.  Just equitable.\n\nI\u2019m so jealous, my country doesn\u2019t mandate Any maternity or paternity leave.  So many people get no paid leave, and risk losing their jobs if they take unpaid leave.", "This is a work issue, not a home and family issue.  Does your spouse have input on how you conduct your work day?  You're making an assumption that the wife will pick up the slack. It's more likely that daycare will pick up the slack.  \n\nAny new parent who thinks they can wfh and take care of a baby at the same time is not planning well.  The wife should not be counting on it either unless her job is very very flexible.  It's very fair to take people's work abilities into account here.", "Mother has maternity leave. She won't be working at home for quite a period. Unless she wants to give him paternity leave, which I doubt.", "In UK, shared parental leave is when the mother transfers some of her maternity leave allowance to the father. He says he's availing of that, so I'd guess that she will be taking off three to six months and then he will be taking off six months. It's the initial, newborn stage when he is wanting to work in the office. The time when baby does nothing but eat, sleep, poop, cry. Pretty distracting if I'm honest. And he says he isn't expecting her to work from home while he's on leave.", "Two people working from home in a medium sized London flat, while caring for a young child is exactly the reason why birth rates of urbanites are so low. We need free childcare.\n\nEdit: in fact that's exactly what happened to us (replace major city) during COVID. In retrospect I would rather stick a pencil into my eye socket than having to go through that again.", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t make the baby yet. You two have to sort this out.", "YTA, you can't just throw your hands up and announce you don't want to deal with this. \n\nAlso I gotta say, if you can't handle someone knocking on your door to deliver a parcel, you **definitely** cannot handle a child.", "NTA.\n\nShe's probably misreading the situation, thinking you want to go back to the office so you can avoid being around her and the baby as much as possible.  She might be envisioning you getting up in the morning and leaving extra early to grab breakfast on the way, working all day then grabbing a quick beer (or three) with coworkers then finally getting home and collapsing in bed, too tired to help out.  \n\nNot everyone can do WFH, especially if there's an infant in the house.  You need to reassure her that this isn't a hint of things to come (you constantly finding reasons to not be home) and she needs to understand that having a baby will force changes in many areas, including work patterns.", "NAH, this is your choice to make. But I can see why your wife feels upset that you're actively changing your work patterns to be around them less. \n\nI also think you're making a mistake. Being able to wfh will allow you to see your newborn child so much more. I think once the kid is born you'll find you want to be there. But for now, if you really think it'll be impossible to wfh then better you share that with your wife now so she is prepared.", "What makes YTA is right now you are happy WFH 3 days a week, but once a baby arrives, you only want to WFH 1 day a week. That\u2019s a very clear message you don\u2019t want to be around your child. \n\nAlso, what is the commute? If that\u2019s an hour or two a day you\u2019re not home anymore to help out, I\u2019d be pretty upset if I was your wife.", "NTA  but please figure things out before having a child. Working from home can't be combined with caring for a baby. I'm a childminder and parents still bring their kids to me when the work from home.\n\nAlso keep in mind that dyspraxia has a genetic component and this can make your task of raising your baby harder (I have two kids with dyspraxia and I do consider it a disability. These kids need parental guidance longer than normal developing kids).", "NTA. Caring for a child is a full time job. You can't both work from home and take care of your baby unless you have extremely flexible work. You will be doing one of those things poorly. \n\nMy partner and I both work from home. We each took 6 months off so she was with one of us for her first year and then started to go to a dayhome at one.", "NTA working from home with a child around can be really distracting. I've been working from home for years, and when my child is home I have to take care of their needs as well as my own if my partner is at work and I lose any work flow I've gotten into at times, you can somewhat prepare stuff in advance but when it comes to babies and young children there is a lot of unexpected things that can happen. You also would not be able to give either of them your full attention.\nYou and your wife need to have a proper discussion about the arrangements you will be making for baby when the time finally comes. Not wanting to wfh with a baby is not a rejection of your family, it just won't work for you, and that's ok, she needs to know it's nothing personal against her or your future child.", "NTA.\n\nBut hold on the trying for a baby until you agree about how your work future will look like (both of yours). I also assume that you will have some kind of child care when both of you have been home for 1-2 years. \n\nI know a lot of parents with small children preferring to go to work as much as possible just to be able to focus (I also live in Europe with good parental leave conditions and good child care after that) . And they don't even have your problems with dyslexia and so on. And it sounds like you don't think that your wife will let you have much work peace while working from home. So it's good to setup some boundary's. Then of course there will be exception when your child and wife really needs to be a priority.", "We'll of course you don't want to work and take care of the kid at the same time. Work time is work time. For both of you of course. I'm a bit concerned that your plan is to have your wife do what you know is perfectly unreasonable for you once her maternity leave ends, because she'll still be working from home then with you not there. YWBTA if that's where you're going with this, so I guess I need more INFO on that issue to make a decision.", "NAH. I\u2019m not going to call your wife an asshole either because you should have had this conversation before you started trying to grow your family.\n\nMy spouse has WFH for years, before the pandemic, which has allowed our family to have a lot of flexibility and to share household responsibilities in an equitable way.\n\nWhen I think about taking on a new challenge or obligation, I\u2019m thinking about what it will be like with our current dynamic. If I took on an additional challenge or obligation and then my spouse was like \u201cYeah I\u2019ll be heading back to the office now\u2026\u201d I would be at a minimum annoyed and on the more extreme end I suppose it\u2019s possible to feel like he had manipulated the situation to his benefit. \n\nNot everyone\u2019s jobs are the same, so this isn\u2019t intended to be a case where what works for me will work for everyone, but if your wife is accustomed to things being a certain way when she imagines bringing a child into the mix and then only after the \u201ctrying\u201d begins you tell her \u201cIt\u2019s actually going to look like this\u2026\u201d I can easily imagine her feelings.\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve stopped to consider it from her perspective and I think it needs to be a more in depth conversation where you both discuss your expectations instead of making assumptions.\n\nGood luck.", "Going to tell you... you cannot effectively work and care for a baby at the very same time.  People should NEVER assume WFH means they don't need childcare.   Unless you can commit fully to working when you need to and watching a child when you need to, this isn't going to go well.  It's one thing if you and your partner can switch schedules or if you have  VERY flexible schedule without deadlines or set hours... then maybe.  Otherwise, don't kid yourself that you can do both at the same time.  Kids grow, jobs can change.  New jobs may not allow WFH.\n\nNTA, but your wife is for assuming she doesn't owe full responsibility to her employer while working, and her family when not.", "Nta", "Ehhhh working from home with a child is hard. But your approach to the conversation is selfish.  It should have been \u201chey when we have the baby and our parental leave is over what do you think we should do?\u201d And then you work through the options together. Don\u2019t have the baby before this is figured out.  I\u2019m going slight YTA for the selfishness", "ESH.\n\nWhen you have a child you need childcare - even when working from home. Your employer is paying you to work, not care for your child.\n\nGet childcare once your maternity/parental leave is completed and then you can both WFH as much as you want.", "NTA.

Kids bring out all the communication challenges in a relationship.", "Indeed, ywbta if you don't realize that having kids will mean giving up some of your own comfort to make time to raise the child.

Then OP can take 18 weeks parental leave, presumably after his wife is done Mat leave (that's presuming their companies don't offer more, these are just the minimums). That takes the kid to almost a year and a half which is plenty old enough for daycare.", "I didn\u2019t see this before making my comment, but it\u2019s exactly what I was trying to explain.

It's not feasible and except for in emergencies like the shutdown period of the pandemic when all the day cares were closed, most business will not allow it. If she's planning on cheating her company by pretending to them that she has child care when she doesn't, she shouldn't be. \n\nIn this case, both of them have fairly extensive parental leave which, if they split the time the way they're planning to do, will give them nearly a year without both having to work at the same time. So for that long, neither of them have any need to work without childcare... the other one *is* the childcare. \n\nAfter that, they will need to put the child in some kind of day care or get a nanny, like any two-job family normally has to do.
