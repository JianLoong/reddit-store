{"id": 17398, "submission_id": "13j6vjn", "title": "AITA for telling my step-dad that what my mom's giving him is more than he deserves?", "selftext": "My mom's been with my step-dad off and on for about 15 years (I'm 24). They have a 14yo daughter together.\n\nIn 2021 my step-dad bought a house, but put it in my mom's name because his credit is shit. So, his money, her house. They aren't married, and have never filed taxes as common-law partners in my country. This is all relevant.\n\nLate last year my step-dad got back on drugs and my mom left with my sister. They're currently NC because he's off his rocker. I've been texting my step-dad since the new year because I want text evidence for my mom that he's still not mentally fit to go for any sort of custody of my sister. He's living in the house, my mom moved out.\n\nNeither of them want the house. My step-dad says he wants to move back to his home city, and my mom doesn't want to \"take his house.\" When it sells, she intends to take only the money he owes her (about 25k), and give him the rest. Legally she doesn't have to do this, because there's literally nothing proving he has any right to the house beyond *maybe* squatters rights.\n\nMy step-dad is being stubborn and delusional, because he's on fucking drugs. He's saying he \"won't sell for less\" and wants to sell this worthless trash house for double what he paid for it. My mom is \"waiting for his decision,\" which I already told her he won't make, because he's gone insane from all of the aforementioned fucking drugs.\n\nI wound up snapping and texted my step-dad: \"Don't be greedy you idiot. Mom is already planning on giving you every dollar you don't owe her, which is more than I think you deserve after everything you've done.\"\n\nNow he's going around telling people that my mom wants to take all the money from the house, which I never said, and my mom is upset because what I said set him off and now he's harassing her and my sister. I honestly feel really bad about that but also don't think it's my fault he's being a manipulative fuck and twisting my words around.\n\nEDIT: I accept I'm TA, but a lot of you aren't understanding the dynamic with my mom, saying it's her business and to leave her out of it. First of all, would you be saying that if he was my dad and not my step-dad? Because he's been a father to me for more than half my life, I have a right to talk to him. Secondly, my mom knows I talk to him and approves. Yes it's her business and I'm not involved beyond letting him vent in my DMs every time but this one.\n\nEither way, I've blocked him. I just think it's weird how you're all saying that it's exclusively my mom's business when I have a relationship with him too. In what rational world was I supposed to know that he would take the exact opposite of what I said until it happened?

That's between your mother and your stepdad, not any children in the family, whether adults or minors.  \n\n\n>What kind of trouble could it cause?\n\nWell, for example, \"I have it in writing (text message) that (mother) is going to give me $x from the sale of the house (everything but what he owes her).\" You shouldn't be making any statements on behalf of your mother, especially not related to money."]}
