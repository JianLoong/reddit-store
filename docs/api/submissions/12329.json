She worked for his father (not anymore) and he introduced them, idk the whole story. He\u2019s a sweet guy and gets along with our friend group very well. Him and my bf are also best friends and this made my issue 10x harder. \n\nAva and I aren\u2019t the best of friends but being roommates were close. It\u2019s just us two so sometimes on drunk nights we\u2019ll sit there and laugh all night about the dumbest shit. One night Ava  came home drunk out of her mind. She started going on ab having the best sex of her life and saying she doesn\u2019t know why she hasn\u2019t \u201ctried older men\u201d yet. I laughed it off and tried to send her to bed bc I thought she was joking. She ended up getting into my bed and showing me her phone. \nShe starts showing me PICTURES OF THIS MANS DAD. I almost threw up. She then goes on about him being her bfs dad and to not tell him. The next morning she still remembers the night and starts crying telling me to not tell anyone and she\u2019ll figure it out. I asked how long, and she said it\u2019s been two months. A few nights later I come home from work to this man and her in our apt. Our apts tiny so she heard the door open and ran out of the room. I asked if her bf was here and she looked at me laughing saying it was the dad. I told her she was disgusting and I wanted him out and left. He ends up leaving and she texts me to come back to talk.\n\nShe told me not to tell her bf or mine or she\u2019d be pissed and it\u2019s not my place. She said she needed time to get the right words to say and that she\u2019ll tell him when she\u2019s ready. We usually hang out often with her bf so it\u2019s been so difficult not saying anything. Most recently I come home to Ava and a couple of her friends drinking and talking ab the dad. They\u2019re all talking like what she\u2019s doing should be idolized. I didn\u2019t engage but I was in the kitchen when I hear her say he\u2019s coming over again tonight. I yelled not in this house. That turned into an argument and her calling me a bitch saying it\u2019s her place too. She said it\u2019s her relationship and to not get involved. I told her I\u2019d give her a day to tell her bf or I\u2019d do it myself. The next day she thought I was joking and I see her leave with a bag packed getting into the dads car. I was fed by this point and go to my bfs house drowning in tears telling him ab what she\u2019s been doing. He was beyond pissed and told me he\u2019ll tell him. I get a text saying her bf  came over and he told him everything and he was broken into tears. She came back the next morning screaming at me saying I was a bitch who had nothing better to do to then involve myself in other peoples shit. She said I\u2019m just bitter bc \u201cshe can satisfy two men while I can barely handle one\u201d. I left and I\u2019m staying with my bf for now and I\u2019m getting messages from all her friends saying I\u2019m an AH  and that she\u2019s going through sm rn and I shouldn\u2019t have added to her stress.

NTA\n\nJust say you're a cheater lol.", "What the father and the girl did messed up the relationship.

It's unfortunately not how it works, and how \"unfair\" it is doesn't enter into it.\n\nIt's extremely unfair and the girlfriend and dad are AHs, but that's not relevant. The question is are you TA for being the one to blow it all up when it's not your relationship ... and yes, you are."]}
