Him and my bf are also best friends and this made my issue 10x harder. \n\nAva and I aren\u2019t the best of friends but being roommates were close. It\u2019s just us two so sometimes on drunk nights we\u2019ll sit there and laugh all night about the dumbest shit. One night Ava  came home drunk out of her mind. She started going on ab having the best sex of her life and saying she doesn\u2019t know why she hasn\u2019t \u201ctried older men\u201d yet. I laughed it off and tried to send her to bed bc I thought she was joking. She ended up getting into my bed and showing me her phone. \nShe starts showing me PICTURES OF THIS MANS DAD. I almost threw up. She then goes on about him being her bfs dad and to not tell him. The next morning she still remembers the night and starts crying telling me to not tell anyone and she\u2019ll figure it out. I asked how long, and she said it\u2019s been two months. A few nights later I come home from work to this man and her in our apt. Our apts tiny so she heard the door open and ran out of the room. I asked if her bf was here and she looked at me laughing saying it was the dad. I told her she was disgusting and I wanted him out and left. He ends up leaving and she texts me to come back to talk.\n\nShe told me not to tell her bf or mine or she\u2019d be pissed and it\u2019s not my place. She said she needed time to get the right words to say and that she\u2019ll tell him when she\u2019s ready. We usually hang out often with her bf so it\u2019s been so difficult not saying anything. Most recently I come home to Ava and a couple of her friends drinking and talking ab the dad. They\u2019re all talking like what she\u2019s doing should be idolized. I didn\u2019t engage but I was in the kitchen when I hear her say he\u2019s coming over again tonight. I yelled not in this house. That turned into an argument and her calling me a bitch saying it\u2019s her place too. She said it\u2019s her relationship and to not get involved. I told her I\u2019d give her a day to tell her bf or I\u2019d do it myself. The next day she thought I was joking and I see her leave with a bag packed getting into the dads car. I was fed by this point and go to my bfs house drowning in tears telling him ab what she\u2019s been doing. He was beyond pissed and told me he\u2019ll tell him. I get a text saying her bf  came over and he told him everything and he was broken into tears. She came back the next morning screaming at me saying I was a bitch who had nothing better to do to then involve myself in other peoples shit. She said I\u2019m just bitter bc \u201cshe can satisfy two men while I can barely handle one\u201d.

You aren't getting an award for solving a problem no one asked you to.", "Thank you!", "NTA she made it your business when she started bringing the dad to your shared house the dad is disgusting also who does that to their own son?!", "Nta", "NTA. The light is not to blame for the roaches in the pantry.", "Yeah she is going through something right now. A breakup. As she deserves.\n\nThe only thing I'll say is you should have told him after the first time. You don't fall on someone's dick by accident.\n\nNTA because you did do the right thing.", "Oh hell no,  the only way you would be the AH here is for not telling him sooner!\n\nI would message all of those friends and tell them that your roomate was also sleeping with their dads!\n\nNTA", "NTA but go back to your place and bring your boyfriend. She might mess with your stuff.", "NTA -  If she had been discreet about it then it wouldn't have been your problem.   As it was, she put you in a compromising position and she was essentially asking you to lie to cover her bad behaviour.", "Nta. In any way. No one should have to put up with that the not your place people are wrong.", "Having morals does not make you an AH. NTA!", "NTA. She f'd around... Literally... And found out", "Nta lmaooo the audacity", "NTA. She put you in a horrible position and then had the audacity to say that back to you. \n\nI feel for you  having to get a new room-mate and all that jazz.", "Nta. Relationships matter here. You were likely losing at least one relationship when she told you about the affair.", "NTA\n\nfor someone who claimed it wasn\u2019t your business to know about the fact that she was cheating, she sure did go around loud mouthing it in your vicinity. she also doesn\u2019t seem to think there\u2019s anything morally wrong with cheating, considering how she flaunted being able \u201cto handle two men.\u201d you did the right thing.", "NTA\nAfter she \"let her secret slip\" she escalated by bringing the dad into your home. She dragged you into the ugly situation, probably believing you had to tolerate watching her switch of between father and unknowing son since her secret was out, to you. You are under no obligation to silently watch her psychosexual drama play out in your home.", "NTA, primarily because her stupid ass involved you, HAD HIM OVER, was openly bragging about the situation with her friends where you could hear, and not being discreet around you at all.  What the hell were you supposed to do?\n\nYou should move and dump this toxic \u2018friendship\u2019 as soon as you\u2019re able. I couldn\u2019t continue to live with someone like that.  It\u2019s not the age gap (though I\u2019d be uncomfortable to an extent), it\u2019s the disgusting cheating. I feel so sorry for the boyfriend.  What a terrible father.", "Okay, she told you to stay out of it and that was hard as Hell. Not only because her boyfriend is your partner's best friend, but also because she goes around glorifying her actions to her other friends. Meaning *so* many people know now.\n\nNTA. She's embarassingly stupid to think that none of those she confided in would ever rat her out. It just happened a whole lot earlier than expected.\n\nBesides, she's still got the Dad, right?", "NTA. What she did was disgusting.", "Nta. You have morals. End of discussion. She\u2019s gross.", "Yikes NTA. Block them all, but keep us updated.", "There is no universe where you could possibly be in the wrong here. NTA", "Definitely NTA, but aren't you worried she'll trash your stuff?", "NTA. This entire situation is beyond fucked up. This guy deserved to know that his gf was leading him on, and that his father is so fucking scummy. His father deserves whatever fallout he gets out of this. This is some Jerry Springer shit right here", "NTA\n\nShe was involving you by bringing him to your home and banging him there. Then expecting you to not tell YOUR bf or hers. If she wanted you out of it she should have never brought him over.\n\nAlso, if she\u2019s \u201cgoing through so much\u201d, how is banging her BFs dad going to help her? That\u2019s a lame excuse. \n\nMove out when you can. That relationship is done and you\u2019ll never be civil to each other again.", "NTA. Ava is though", "NTA This is not confidential infornation. You can tell whoever you want when you know someone is lying about their current sexual practices to their sexual partner. Cheating puts innocent people in danger of illness, and it's fraudulent (doubt nothing monetary happened between her and the bf for months). You did the right thing. If she wants to do something, she can own it.", "NTA. This whole situation must have been so hard for you!! I think you did the right thing, but honestly you had to expect her blowing up on you for it. Someone who can cheat on their bf with his dad isn\u2019t going to understand morally why you did what you did.", "NTA. You did the right thing in a very hard situation.", "NTA more like NTR", "As someone who has been cheated on and lied to, when I finally confronted the \u201cfriend\u201d who fucked my ex I asked why she didn\u2019t tell me- she said it wasn\u2019t her place, like it was somehow HER place on my boyfriend\u2019s dick. \n\nNTA. She\u2019s not satisfying two men, she\u2019s destroying a family beyond repair for a dick that will need Viagra in a few years.", ">She said I\u2019m just bitter bc \u201cshe can satisfy two men while I can barely handle one\u201d.\n\n\nI'm sorry, when did this become a flex?? \ud83e\udd22", "NTA\n\nDad and the gf both needed to be ex\nexposed for who they really are.\n\nYou helped an innocent man avoid catastrophe.\n\nThis lady is chaos and drags bystanders into her chaos by lying. \n\nWhat if this girl got pregnant by her bf's dad and claimed the bf was the child's father?", "That poor boy needed to know what kind of guy his own dad was.  Man.  That poor kid.\n\nNTA", "NTA and can we get updates on the situation. \n\nIs the dad married? Because if so\u2026. Oof. \nI seriously feel for the bf because the relationship with his dad is forever ruined.", "NTA, but kinda dumb. You didn\u2019t just blow up her relationship; you blew up your living situation. I hope you\u2019re the only one on the lease, but if not, this situation is going to suck for a while. I would have found a way out of that living situation before telling anyone.", "NTA.  I'm of the opinion that when you know a thing like that about a cheater and you know both parties the best policy is to neither volunteer information nor lie if you're asked.  That being said, people generally tell their SO everything and she was naive to think you wouldn't tell yours.  It's not on you that he said something.\n\nUltimately you can't be upset if you're confronted with the consequences of your own behaviors.  If she didn't want to deal with the fallout she shouldn't have fucked someone else.  Also she deserves whatever she gets for doing that to her boyfriend with his own father.  Fuck her.", "NTA. To everyone who says it\u2019s not her place, cheating is a very easy way to spread STI\u2019s. Imagine finding out health news about a person and not sharing that news with them.", "NTA but a hero definitely", "The living situation will never be the same again. There's no moving past that.", "NTA.", "Agreed OP is NTA \n\nop gave her time to get it right\n\nAnd i guarantee  the real reason she is upset because the father dropped her as soon as the son found out and now she has no one and i wonder if the father is married\n\nOp move out she will actively try to get revenge", "The hottest places in hell are reserved for those who remain neutral in times of crisis -Dante\n\nNTA, definitely.", "You should space e s h out cause I think the bot will count that as your judgement", "  I agree with you. In this case though what annoys me most, apart Op having to lie, is that room mate has already been cheating for two months, and going on, without regrets, seemingly thinking it is an accomplishment and fun.", "> Normally I would say it wasn\u2019t your place\n\nSounds like you would normally be an AH then.", "What kind of person screws their son's girlfriend tho?  I'm amazed I don't see anyone talking about the dad.  His is the larger betrayal.", "Agreed, associating with scandalous people becomes a reflection of you. Best to cut the cord.", "In HS, I once overheard three girls who I believe were sophomores talking about how they all slept with the same guy. Not their boyfriends; a friend of all of their boyfriends. It was wild, I truly sat in the stall listening because I couldn\u2019t believe it. \n\nI remember one believing she was pregnant but she was positive if she was it was the one she cheated on her bf with. All three girls acted like it was amazing they all screwed the same guy whilst also cheating on their bf? I didn\u2019t ever find out if she was pregnant, it was near the end of the year and that summer I moved anyway", "The truly nuclear option would be to tell her own parents", "With Ashton Kutcher \ud83d\ude42", "Agree, but seeing how this evolved, I see it as a good riddance. Better not have people who support such actions as friends", "So basically OP shouldn\u2019t have interfered because other people could do even more stupid things/ fear that they could do so?\nSounds kinda shady\nAlso, I can\u2019t really see how this wasn\u2019t her problem, it obviously bothered her AND her group of friends was involved", ">she is being groomed.\n\nThat's a weird way of saying she is betraying her bf.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> dad is a predator.\n\nThat's a weird thing to call someone who's sleeping with an adult.", "She's in her mid 20s", "Finding out that your roomate is sleeping with her bf's dad is a situation most people would need some time to wrap their head around before telling the roomates bf.", "Omg. I didn\u2019t even think if he is married.", "I\u2019m so sorry to hear this. One of my childhood friends transitioned from male to female and got a lot of negative back lash from friends and family. I tried to be a support system for them and advocate for them because they had no one else in their corner. Just know hateful people are just bored and like to see others down. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re a beautiful person and my heart goes out to you and I hope life brings people who truly love and care for you. \ud83e\udd0d", "Gotta work that into every conversation, huh.", "And the friends think it's fun -- time to find better friends.", "Oh by far but I didn't mention him because he's not really OP's problem in the scheme of things. Frankly the idea of having sex with someone that is screwing or has screwed a relative is extremely repulsive to me. \n\nAlthough why the dad is coming over to their (OP and roommate) shared apartment to bang his son's gf is even weirder. I wonder if he's married. I feel like the dad wanted his son to find out, pulling that crap.", "Right?   What kind of relationship does the dad have with the son to introduce the two, see that they are dating, then say, I\u2019d like to hit that too.   Brings a whole new level to father son bonding.", "yeah thats all good and well.  the road to hell is paved with good intentions.  \n\nThis is kind of one of those situations you have to live through to understand.  While yes, you are being a good citizen/person, you are opening yourself up to liability you didn't create.  You open  yourself up to enough peoples liability, and you will pay for it eventually.   It's risk management basically.   \n\nThe risk isn't worth the reward in these cases.   All it takes is one situation to go horribly bad and you will come out of it with the same thinking other adults did 'I should have just minded my own fucking business and let them fuck their own lives up.'\n\nThere is a reason children stop taking on childish risks as they get older, eventually they ended up having to pay for the risk and now know the payment wasn't worth it.  Same deal when interjecting yourself into things that can break people mentally.  You are never getting gold out of these situations, you will only get nothing or pain.  It's a lose, lose situation.", "I think you misspelled your username and accidentally put zy4 instead of t", "Narcissism.  A constant need to redirect attention to themselves even from internet strangers. Sympathy farming. Very close to main character syndrome.  They get uncomfortable when the plot doesn't revolve around their own heroic arc.", "The roommate made it to do with OP when she made her a witness and put her in the position to mind what she said/lie by omission to both her boyfriend and his best friend.", "So OP is supposed to be stressed out knowing this is happening and stare this dude in the face every time they hang out, acting like everything is ok when it isn\u2019t?  Did you miss the part where OP went to her boyfriend CRYING?  Her mental health was being effected by this BS. She\u2019s in no way responsible for shouldering this burden.  Her roommate should have done a better job keeping it on the DL.  A line was crossed when she BROUGHT THE FATHER OVER TO THEIR SHARED LIVING SPACE. Are you serious?", "That's a funny way of saying you have no ethics nor integrity. You should reflect on that and how you can become a better person.", "Wouldn\u2019t say they are racist, but at least enabling it\nOtherwise this comparison would also mean, that OP would also be cheating, if she didn\u2019t say anything", "Affairs never stay secret forever, it would have come out eventually. And if op hadn't said anything their relationship with their boyfriend would have also ended because how would they be able to trust someone who, by keeping the secret, appeared to side with a cheater?  NTA.", "The roommate and father were the ones driving the trolley. There is no split on the track. It's just the boyfriend, blindfolded.  \n\nOP and her bf took their friend's blindfold off.", "They're not the same at all, and this isn't a theoretical exercise on ethical principles. The trolley problem is designed to make people think. And btw, a friend said she'd run and jump in front of the trolley so creative solutions are possible.\n\nThe situation is more akin to terrorists taking people hostage and yelling that unless you give them this and that, innocent blood is on your hands. It's not. They chose to do something vile. They chose to continue. Just like terrorists counting on other people to care, they counted on her fear of hurting the bf, but it was them hurting the bf all along.\n\nThe two made it her problem when they dragged her into it -- bragging about the relationship and betraying a common friend in front of her. She gave them time to change things, try to come clean in a less destructive way. They didn't. She and her own bf also risked their relationship -- the betrayed party could think them liars, go NC with everyone out of hurt, etc.\n\nI do see your point, and it's probably coming from a place of caring, but it's wrong."]}
