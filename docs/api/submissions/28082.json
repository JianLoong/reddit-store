Habitually Tardy Friend Showed Up To The Casino 2.5 Hours Late And Was Pissed.", "selftext": "Me and my mates planned a Casino outing this past Saturday evening. Three of us drove together, the fourth said he\u2019d meet us there. The plan was to meet at 7pm.\n\nThe three of us arrive to the Ino a little after 7. Fourth friend is not there, so we get some dinner and start gambling. At around 9:30pm we decide to call it a night (craps table kicked our ass) and go home. Fourth friend still hadn\u2019t arrived when we left.\n\nAs we\u2019re driving home, I get a call from Mr. Tardy and he\u2019s yelling his ass off about how he\u2019s at the Casino and we left without him etc. I laugh and tell him tough luck, you were over 2.5 hours late. He is still pissed at me and reading me the riot act all day, calling me a shite friend. Some of our friends have taken his side.\n\nImportant to note, this dude is always late. He has zero respect for other\u2019s time. The only reason I might even consider myself being the asshole in this situation is that he did message us before we left asking if we were still there. I did not reply to him. With how late he was, I didn\u2019t think I owed him a response.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1696272951, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16y4z79/aita_habitually_tardy_friend_showed_up_to_the/", "score": 3783, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
