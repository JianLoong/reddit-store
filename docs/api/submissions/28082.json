Habitually Tardy Friend Showed Up To The Casino 2.5 Hours Late And Was Pissed.", "selftext": "Me and my mates planned a Casino outing this past Saturday evening. Three of us drove together, the fourth said he\u2019d meet us there. The plan was to meet at 7pm.\n\nThe three of us arrive to the Ino a little after 7. Fourth friend is not there, so we get some dinner and start gambling. At around 9:30pm we decide to call it a night (craps table kicked our ass) and go home. Fourth friend still hadn\u2019t arrived when we left.\n\nAs we\u2019re driving home, I get a call from Mr. Tardy and he\u2019s yelling his ass off about how he\u2019s at the Casino and we left without him etc. I laugh and tell him tough luck, you were over 2.5 hours late. He is still pissed at me and reading me the riot act all day, calling me a shite friend. Some of our friends have taken his side.\n\nImportant to note, this dude is always late. He has zero respect for other\u2019s time. The only reason I might even consider myself being the asshole in this situation is that he did message us before we left asking if we were still there. I did not reply to him. With how late he was, I didn\u2019t think I owed him a response.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1696272951, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16y4z79/aita_habitually_tardy_friend_showed_up_to_the/", "score": 1130, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But for things like picnics, pool days, and poker, where typically people stay for hours, I\u2019ve never seen anyone get mad at someone being late. You can always pop in at any time, who cares if he\u2019s late? \n\nThey\u2019re under no obligation to wait for him, but like, I don\u2019t understand why they were bothered that he was late. It\u2019s not like they were carpooling or pooling money.\n\nSince they\u2019re friends, I think it would have been polite to respond to the text, but it doesn\u2019t seem like OP cares about maintaining this friendship, so it is what it is.", "Why? There were three of them already there together and he didn\u2019t hold them up from doing anything. It\u2019s a casino night, not an appointment or a date. Why did his presence even matter?", "Lol what a weird takeaway. I'm not a \"sad little person.\" I'm a normal functioning adult who doesn't give unearned respect to someone who repeatedly disrespects. If he was 30 minutes, maybe. 2.5 hours is just blatant disrespect and doesn't warrant a response.", "Why? Because he was 2.5 fucking hours late. Do you really expect the friends to just sit around, thumb in their asses for God knows how long waiting for some assistance who was told 7 o'clock? No, they fucking did their shit. Got over it and went home.", ">Why did his presence even matter?\n\nIf his presence is of no importance, then him knowing whether or not his friends are there is of no importance, therefore OP not responding to the text is of no importance.", "A text always warrants a response if you actually consider them your friend or family.   If you consider being petty and vindictive to the people you are supposed to care about as \"normal\" then that is pretty sad imo.", "This little guy talking about disrespect. Lol.", "[removed]", "Lmao uh no. You come up with that conclusion and then backed into it. The point it the three guys who were there didn\u2019t need the fourth to proceed with their plans, but the fourth needed at least one of the three to proceed with his. If I\u2019m hosting a party that starts at 7 it\u2019s of no consequence to me if one of my friends isn\u2019t there at 7, but if he\u2019s coming at 10 it\u2019s of great consequence whether the party is still going on. Do you happen to not have friends?", "Found the person that is constantly late and doesn't give a sh*T about anyone's time but their own!", "Yeah, does appear you're trying to.", "If I was undeserving of a headsup of lateness with an ETA. He becomes undeserving of my whereabouts.", "lMAO UH, YES.", "When I make plans to go to events with my friends, I respect everyone's time and show up at the agreed upon time. When I believe I will be late, I communicate that and provide an ETA. My friends do the same.\n\nThat's what happens when you and your friends all respect each other's time.", "Can you explain to me how retaliatory pettiness doesn\u2019t make one an AH?", "Good point", "It\u2019s not an event, though. That\u2019s the whole point. There is no designated time slot. He didn\u2019t disrespect anyone\u2019s time. They didn\u2019t miss out on anything. They went through with their exact plans at the exact time they wanted to. He just wasn\u2019t there for it and OP got pissy about it.", "retaliate is an action, he did an inaction. Just being petty doesn't make you an AH, especially if it is wholly justified after being heavily disrespected.", "Being petty makes you an asshole."]}
