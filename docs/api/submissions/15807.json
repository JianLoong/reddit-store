My younger brother (let's call him Ed) in question is 6.\n\nMy father (49) has been in and out of our lives for the past 6 years. He was working abroad and providing for us during that time, but us kids have slowly started to forget his presence around the house. In 2021, he had a huge fight with my mother (48) and decided to leave us under the guise of \"visiting his relative's funeral\". We haven't seen him since. \n\nIt's been very tough for my mother who's tried her utmost best to make the best of such an awful situation for us kids without much help..so my siblings and I (mostly a bunch of teens) have tried our best to make things generally easier for her, including assisting in the raising up of Ed.\n\nEd always used to call me by my name, but recently (like a few months ago) he's picked up the habit of calling me dad. I felt very awkward at first, but after some thought I figured it was an honest mistake and  didn't pay much attention to it.\n\nIt didn't stop there. Ed started calling me dad more, whether it was in private or whether it was in front of the family. I was extremely confused.\n\nEarlier this afternoon, I picked him up from his school. When we reached home, I went to my mother and jokingly said \"This random child has been following me the entire time, I think he's lost.\" (We have a way of joking that I think is pretty wholesome, I'm sure he enjoys it too).\n\nEd playfully tugged me on the arm and said \"How dare you say that! I'm your son\". \n\nNow here's where I might be TA. I didn't want him to grow up believing that I was something I'm not, so I gently responded \"Ed, I'm not your dad. I'm your older brother, OK? We share the same mother.\"\n\nEd replied \"You're my dad now, because my real dad is never coming back.\" Hearing that tore my heart and I didn't know how to respond. I hugged him but he didn't seem too happy and left.\n\nMy mother pulled me aside later and told me that I shouldn't have said what I said and that I have hurt his feelings. I tried to explain that as much as I understand his feelings, I wanted him to know who we truly are to each other and didn't want to devastate him later in life. I also mentioned how awkward it made me feel. She said that maybe Ed is calling me dad not because I'm his actual father, but maybe because I'm one of the safest masculine examples he's got.\n\nUpon reflection, I'm starting to feel very guilty about what I did. I think my mother is right; perhaps I *was* a little too harsh. I need some people to talk sense into me.

Social-wise, calling a 19 yr old \"dad\" and a 48-yr old \"mom\" could also be VERY  awkward. \n\nYour mother should look into family counseling, or even individual for your brother.  It's a heavy load for you all.", "NTA - I think what you did was the right thing. It's difficult for kids that age to see their friends with their fathers and not understand why they don't have a dad. And they don't understand where babies come from and why you being their \"dad\" is not correct. He just sees you as a role model that he can look up to, and it kind of feels like he has a dad in you. Correcting him makes it so that this doesn't become a permanent thing and reminds him that you are not his father. Keep emphasizing that you're his big brother and that's even better that his father (trying to put a positive spin on your relationship to him).\n\nYour mother on the other hand is using you as a quasi-replacement and doesn't want to deal with the bigger issues here. She definitely needs to face the reality of the situation and what it's doing to you and your siblings.", "NTA\n\nYou can be big bro!  \n\nJust like Dad but better! \n\nI think you did the right thing in a loving and caring way.  \n\nHe's a young child, but you're right very impressionable and waiting longer to tell the truth can cause deeper issues down the road.  \n\nI think just reiterating to him that you are not Dad but you can be just as good as Dad as Big Bro's!\n\nI think finding age appropriate ways and positive reinforcement could be helpful here.", "NTA. The issues your brother will face due to him  having a father that has chosen to abandon him will not be solved by him calling you \u2018dad.\u2019 \n\nYou felt uncomfortable with it and you expressed that gently to a young child still learning about relationships and the world around him. He won\u2019t be irreparably damaged because you corrected him.", "NTA. It's a heartbreaking situation, but I think it's important to stay grounded in the reality of what the actual relationships are. Seems like this would have too many future implications to let continue. Does sound like Ed might need the assistance of a counselor. You also didn't snap or yell, so you weren't an AH in your presentation either.", "NTA. \n\nI can see where this might make you feel awkward. If he\u2019s calling you \u201cdad\u201d and your mom \u201cmom\u201d to other people then people will assume you are/once were a couple and then you have to explain the whole thing to them and then they feel awkward for assuming\u2026 yeah.. I can see where this might feel weird to you. And it may only create more problems when/if you move out to be on your own - he might feel abandoned by two fathers.\n\nIt may hurt his feelings at first, but I think you just have to explain to him in the simplest way that you can that you\u2019re still his family and you\u2019ll always be there for him, even if his dad isn\u2019t. And that you can do things for him like your dad did. He just needs to feel love and security and you do that without the title of \u201cdad\u201d.", "NTA. Factual statements good.", "NTA You're WAY too young to be his father, and when you move out and live your own life, he'll only suffer if he's still seeing you as his father at the time. It's sad his dad abandoned him (and the rest if you), but letting him call a 19 yr old Dad is NOT a good solution for that. You loving him does not require encouraging that, and it's better for him if you keep encouraging the right perspective (you're his big brother).", "NTA. For saying you're not dad. But you stepped into the position. And must be doing a good job. Or your little brother would never call you that. Take it as a compliment and roll with it.", "NTA. If mom is out there listening, she needs to pull up her big girl britches and attend to the needs of her youngest without passing off responsibility to OP.", "NTA\n\nIt's weird for you to be called like that, and to me, it's totally understandable. If you really just said \"I'm not your dad. I'm your older brother, OK?\" word for word, then it's a NTA in my book. It's not harsh, degrading or passive aggressive. \n\nIt's a uncomfortable situation for everyone involved, and I hope it's just a short phase for you brother. Keep it up, you seem like an awesome big brother to me!", "NTA - you are not his dad and it's completely justifiable that you don't want to be, and don't want him to see you that way. Being a good older brother is a completely appropriate here.\n\nHowever, your brother sees his friends and kids at school who have dads and wants to be like the others, he doesn't want to think he has a broken home. Calling you dad is his way of saying \"look nothing is wrong with me or my life, I have everything everyone else has\".\n\nHe may not be emotionally mature enough to understand, but you can't have your mom enable it. You can be a father figure without being called dad. Take some time to let him know he's loved and that as his older brother you are going to look out for him. Not having a dad is okay, because he still has a loving family. As he gets older he'll be able to understand and still appreciate you.", "NTA. \n\n You weren't mean, you didn't snap.  You reiterated a basic truth and when he told you his (that you are a parental figure to him as well as brother), you accepted it with affection.  He wasn't happy because you may not have intuited dad=beloved parental figure but that's something you needed to discuss.  You are your own person too and have a say in your relationships.  It may seem harsh but he doesn't get to take away your brotherly relationship to make you his new parent.  He may feel he needs to have a \"Dad\" but he has a fantastic brother doing the job. You seem happy to play the role (what really matters!!) but don't want the title and that's fine.  You're not the first and you won't be the last.\n\nWhy not offer another name or title for him to recognize?   You are not a ***replacement*** but an ***addition***, something new.  Let him know it's not because you don't value your relationship but want it to reflect what it is, two brothers with a great bond and a role model for a younger person.  Look up some terms or make your own, one just for you!  Maybe you can be his Bonus, Big Guy, Grunkle, Senpai, etc .   Good luck!", "NTA. You're a good brother and Ed looks up to you, but you both have a (disappointing) dad out there somewhere. Just be a healthy and attentive person for him.", "NTA, you are not his dad. And your mother should not let him believe that you are his dad (even as an acting figure)\n\nIt will only hurt him more later on. And it seems like your mothers pushes the responsibilities onto you by allowing this", "I would talk to him and tell him you aren't his dad--but you're EVEN BETTER because you're his big bro which means you guys get to do nothing but have fun together. \n\nMaybe you can suggest making up new (non-\"dad\") Nicknames for each other which will be just for you guys and nobody else will use your special brother nicknames.\n\nThere are definitely ways to make it clear for the little guy who you are and to stop him from calling you dad which youre uncomfortable with without hurting his feelings, and generally at that age it's to get them more excited about something cool and special. NTA", "NTA\n\nIt's bad to support a child's delusions. If your mother cares so much, she can go and find him a new dad, you aren't it. It's not healthy for the entire family for you to pretend to be such.", "Nope, NTA and personally, I think your did the right thing and you did it gently and lovingly!! He\u2019s 6, he\u2019s old enough to understand the difference between father and brother! And there\u2019s nothing wrong with him looking up to you like he does and being so involved in his life, but your point is absolutely valid that you\u2019re not his dad and he shouldn\u2019t be calling you that. It really may confuse and complicate things down the road for him. Maybe have a little chat with him again and explain that you\u2019re happy that he sees you that way, but you\u2019re his brother and always will be. And it doesn\u2019t mean you love or care for him any less! You being that role model for him is awesome also!", "NAH. You handled it well.  It might be a good idea to let him pick an appropriate nickname for an older who stands in the place of a father to him. There's no end to articles about what to call step parents and how to choose. I scanned a couple of lists. I kind of liked daddyo, but y'all can decide something that suits you.", "NAH. this is heartbreaking, but it's completely reasonable for you to feel the anxiety of \"if i let this slide, will he grow up with an unhealthy idea of who i am to him and then i'll have to put him through that trauma later,\" etc. since you made it clear to him now, you have the guilt of hurting his feelings. if you waited, you'd feel guilty for not telling him sooner. that's just because you care about him so much, and honestly that's exactly what he needs in his life.\n\nthe most important thing is that he knows you love him and that you're not leaving, which he clearly does. he might need to call you dad for a while to cope, and you might need to remind him sometimes that you're his brother. you shouldn't have been put in this position at all, but you're doing a great job. please don't beat yourself up about this.", "NAH, it sounds like you handled it the best you could. And your mom is right maybe you did hurt his feelings a little, but it wasn't out of malice. I feel sometimes we want to shelter kids and not hurt their feelings for fear of trauma. But disappointment is still a natural part of growing up. That is probably what he is feeling more than anything.\n\nWhat your mom and brother will understand is just because you don't want to be called dad doesn't mean you won't be there for him any less than you are! Positive male role models come in many shapes and forms. Not just \"dad's\".", "NAH. \n\n> My mother pulled me aside later ......said and that I have hurt his feelings\n\nI don't think so. \n\n> We have a way of joking that I think is pretty wholesome, I'm sure he enjoys it too\n\nYall are just Bro/Dad&Son being Bro/Dad&Son. \n\nEd knows. But you rightfully are the \"dad\" figure to Ed. You addressed it perfectly, Ed is aware. Yall are probably all (You, mom & Ed) coping with your fathers neglect in your own ways.\n\nYall are good. Hope y'all have a happy mothers day.\n\nGet yaself a nice tie on Fathers day. You earned it.\n\nEdit: Hey Op, just thinking I have a 5 year old and last fall there was a big thing where all the kids in class called everyone Mom, dad son daughter. Like he came home and told me how his best friend was no his husband, his other friend was his son, his wife was this one girl and he was son to someone. Could be a Blippi thing just saying.", "Nta.", ">She said that maybe Ed is calling me dad not because I'm his actual father, but maybe because I'm one of the safest masculine examples he's got.\n\nShe's exactly right: Ed knows that you aren't his biological father. But that doesn't matter, because you are fulfilling the role in his heart.\n\nIt's perfectly reasonable of you to want to make sure that he is clear on the actual relationships (not every kid in his situation would understand, and it would be a shock to \"discover\" the truth for the first time when he's older). But the good news is that--painful as it is--he *does* understand that he has been abandoned by his biological father and that you have emotionally stepped into the role.\n\nNAH You have earned the title of \"dad\" so it makes sense he wants to use it for you. But it also makes sense that you don't want to accept it. \n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would have a talk with Ed. You could reassure him that you love him unconditionally, you understand why he wants to call you that term, but you are just uncomfortable accepting it. Maybe you even can agree on a nickname that both of you find meaningful and comfortable.", "Nta", "NAH\n\nYou're in a tough position here because you had to tell a young kid a hurtful truth. I think having a one-on-one with him where you explain that even though you aren't his father, you love him as much as any dad has ever loved a child and you feel so lucky to have a little brother like him, because a lot of people don't get to have brothers (let alone brothers that they love). But basically this is a really tough situation, and any path forward is a good one as long as you choose your words with love and kindness (which you seem to be doing already).", "NAH.  I get why he's saying that, but he's old enough to face the truth of what's going on, and better to deal with it now rather than let it build up and blow up later.  You, him, and mom should have a big sit-down talk about all of this.", "NAH. First of all, I am sorry for what you are going through. This is a difficult situation, and I feel like everybody is going to have to handle it in their own way. I haven\u2019t been in this exact situation, but I have been through something similar with siblings much younger than myself and becoming their father figure.\n\nEd is doing exactly what your mom is saying. In his mind, you are the male figure that is present in his life and raising him, which makes him see you as a father figure. \n\nHowever, you are 19 and your mother is present in your life. If being called \u201cdad\u201d makes you uncomfortable, then you have every right to talk to your brother about that. It\u2019s okay to be the positive influence you are for Ed AND to be his brother. Your mother shouldn\u2019t have reprimanded you for what you said, but honestly I am sure that she loves seeing the way your little brother looks up to you and is grateful that he has a positive male figure in his life.\n\nYou sound like a great kid, and the fact that this bothers you the way it does speaks volumes. You care about your little brother, and you don\u2019t want him to convince himself of something that may hurt him in the future. I\u2019m not sure how you will handle this going forward, but I\u2019m glad Ed has a such an excellent older brother.", "NTA. What will happen if and when you have your own kids? Your brother may feel upset and jealous. It isn't fair for your mother to pressure you to be a father to your brother. You're still very young and this isn't your responsibility. You can be there for him without taking on a role that isn't yours. Don't let your mother guilt you; she's parentifying you, and that isn't fair to you.", "NAH . Ed clearly is hurting but you didn\u2019t know why he was calling you dad and it\u2019s important that he knows that you aren\u2019t in fact his dad. Maybe you guys could talk and you can tell him that although you aren\u2019t his dad, he can look up to you and do things with you that are typically reserved for dads. Also sounds like you both could benefit  from therapy if this is a possibility", "NAH.\nEd needs a father figure and a mentor. He's hurting, I'm sure you're hurting too. Please be a big brother and help Ed.", "NAH: While I agree with your mom that your brother doesn\u2019t really think you are his dad. At 19 years old I can understand why wouldn\u2019t be comfortable taking on that role for someone. You aren\u2019t his father and as the two of you get older and the age difference becomes less notable your brother likely won\u2019t want you in the dad role either. You sound like a great big brother, and in a few years your brother will appreciate that you kept your role of sibling and didn\u2019t become his dad. When he hits 15 he isn\u2019t going to be welcoming to a 22 year old father figure.", "NTA, best of luck to you and your family!", "NTA. It\u2019s not going to be healthy for him to see you as his dad. Instead focus on what an amazing relationship brothers can have. When he calls you dad you say: \u2018I\u2019m not your dad, I\u2019m something better, YOUR BIG BROTHER.\u2019 And you can add in fun things like: \u2018Because I\u2019m your big brother I can \u2018insert thing here.\u2019\u2019 Things like: stay up late with him, spoil him with treats, teach him how to do crazy tricks on a skateboard. All the things that a sibling would do. \nAcknowledge that it sucks his dad isn\u2019t there, but you\u2019re so happy that he\u2019s your little brother and you\u2019ll be there for him because that\u2019s what big brothers do.\n\nGood luck to both you.", "NTA. And also, you\u2019re 19. The expectation that you should have known the right thing to say is truly sad to me. Your mom needs some therapy.", "NAH\n\nMaybe you and Ed can come up with a special term he can use for you, like \"Bro-Dad\" or something similar. He clearly looks up to you, and you are doing an awesome job helping out your family in a rough situation. But he's six, and presumably starting to thing about big picture concepts and ideas, he sees his friends that have dads who do things for and with them that you guys do together, so he attached the notion of what a dad is to the role you serve in his life. It's really sweet. But I understand why you are uncomfortable, and you raise good points. The nickname might go a long way toward making sure your brother feels loved and secure in the family, without inadvertently making it look like he's being raised by Oedipus and Jocasta.", "YTA speaking as someone from a similar situation. Your brother knows you aren\u2019t his dad but he doesn\u2019t have the words to describe an older brother with the responsibility of a dad. You do everything a dad does minus the creation of the child. Accept the honor that comes with the title of dad and continue to take care of your brother.", "NAH. No, your not Ed's dad and I can understand how it makes you feel uncmofrtable but at the same time I kinda think your mother might be onto something with the you being the closest/safest male role model for him.  \n\nMaybe sit down with Ed and explain that no, your not his dad but that you'll always love him and be there for him when you can as an awseome big brother?", "NAH It's understandable why you don't want him to see you as his dad and don't want him to get confused.  But I think your mom is into something.  I'm guessing your brother knows he's your brother, but he also knows his dad isn't coming back and wants a father figure to fill that empty place.  He might also be getting bullied at school about not having a dad anymore (worth asking him about it).\n\nI think the best thing you can do would be to sit down and talk to him about why he wants to call you dad. Maybe you two can come up with a nickname he can use.  That way he can still call you something meaningful, but you don't have to feel uncomfortable being called dad.  And if he slips up, he's probably not doing it to anger you.  Just keep doing what you're doing. It's clear you mean a lot to him, and that's the most important thing.", "This is a hard scenario. Obviously you've been doing such a great job being a positive role model and supporter of your brother. So great that he's looking at you like a father figure. Once he gets older, he may stop calling you Dad, but for now keep doing what you're doing with him.", "NAH\n\nLook, I don't think you meant to hurt him. At all. I don't think you even thought that what you said would hurt him. Plus, you're going through a shit time (I wish you the very best of luck, and I genuinely hope your situation improves over time.) Because of that, I don't want to say you're an AH, but your brother and mother arent AHs either.\n\nLook, you did hurt hum. He's young, he's just lost one of the biggest male presences in his life. You should apologize to him, and tell him that you love him. \n\nGood luck mate.", "I wonder if subconsciously he is doing this bc you\u2019re getting to an age where you might leave home? Or - more likely - it doesn\u2019t have to do much with your age, but just giving you the title of Dad because he knows a real dad, a good and loving father, would never leave him. Maybe have a gentle talk with him about how you\u2019ll be his big brother forever, no matter where you are, and that there will never be a time when you two don\u2019t know each other. NTA, it\u2019s better he understands now that the role of older sibling is very important, and he\u2019s lucky to have you.", "NAH it's okay if you don't want to be called Dad. You're not his dad. I don't think he literally means that you are now his father, he means that you are the masculine influence in his life that makes him feel safe and loved. Good on you for being there for your lil bro.", "Neither you or your brother are a-holes.\n\nBut I'd have a serious conversation with your mother about whether she's pushing this narrative. \n\nWhen I was your brothers age i went though a similar predicament and started calling my [close male family member] dad at the insistence of my [female caregiver] he got very upset and kept explaining to me that we didn't have that relationship but the [female caregiver] was insisting in private it was the right thing to do / say and he'd come wround. which caused little me a lot of confusion \n\nNAH", "NAH.  It's not inappropriate for you to set this boundary, and little kids will often take things like this as a rejection. \n\nIt's important to make it clear that while you want his behaviour to change, you're not rejecting him or even changing your role with him. \n\nHere's a suggested script you can riff off if you like: \"Hey bud, I love you very much. Nothing you do or say will ever change that. I'm your big brother and I'll always love you for you. I'm really happy you think of me as a dad. It means a lot to me that you look up to me that much.\n\n\"At the same time, I'm not old enough to be a dad, so it feels weird when I am called that. Can we think of something else you could call me that's special, just for us?\"", "NAH I have a friend who lost there father as she was a young adult. Her younger brother asked her if he could please call her dad for some time, because he needed someone to use this title for. (She said yes).\nYour situations seems different, because it seems like he actively decided to call you dad without asking. But I would like to tell you that you're not alone. But if you feel uncomfortable with it, he has to find other options for his grief, maybe with a therapist.", "NAH. It\u2019s good that you are addressing your discomfort with being called dad by your little brother. Ed needs reassurance that you will be there for him. Maybe work with him to come up with a special nickname that he can call you (instead of dad) to make him feel secure.", "NAH. I would think correcting him somehow (turning it into a positive, ie but I\u2019m your big bro and I\u2019ll be there for you always) would be better. But maybe it\u2019s the other way around and what he needs most is for you to represent a dad in his eyes. I\u2019m afraid only a therapist or some psychiatrist would know.\n\nAnd of course your needs matter too, although I assumed that being older you would be able to deal with whatever option. But you may not, of course and there would be nothing wrong with that, you\u2019re a victim of the situation too.\n\nMaybe a \u00ab\u00a0technical YTA\u00a0\u00bb if you were harsher than needed but hindsight is always 20/20. You seem to genuinely have his interests at heart. Best of luck", "NAH. I feel for you and your Mom and Ed, there's no easy answers here. Ed should definitely be seeing a child therapist to help him deal with any potential abandonment issues that could haunt him later on.", "NAH in opinion, things are tough all around. I think you did the right thing, and I think you should talk to him about it. \n\nExplain that you're not dad, and you miss him too, but you're his big brother and you'll always be there for him no matter what. And if he wants to hang out or if he has questions, or whatever, to talk to you because you'll be there, you'll do your best to help him.", "This is to complex for either of you being the AH or not. you are both just trying to figure out how to proceed now the real AH is out of the picture. Sit and have a talk with him in a way he understands. He just want a dad and seems hurt because the real one walked out on his family.", "NAH but the bigger problem is that your mom is so desperate for Ed to have the father he wants that she is not seeing clearly. This is way beyond a 19 year old to help your mom fully, but you should approach it from that angle when discussing with your mom, gently.\n\nFurthermore, Ed is old enough that he needs to respect other people\u2019s wishes, as long as they are reasonable. And your wish not to be called Dad is reasonable, and your wish should matter to everyone involved.", "NtAH - yes younger siblings can refer to older ones as parents when they look up to them and don't have any other adult role model in that position.  But you did nothing wrong.", "NAH, except your sperm donor. If you're ok with him calling you but making sure he understands you're not his biological dad, then let him. It's nice he looks up to you that much, but if you're truly uncomfy maybe have him pick a new nickname that makes you both feel good. \n\nHonestly me & my two older siblings stepped in for my baby brother, even when his dad was around & especially after.

Which was later revealed.\n\nMay sound weird but..... Why not get your brother to call you \"brother dad\"? When he's older, it will be easier to explain. And easy to explain to others if the question arise.", "Soft YTA but idk I don\u2019t feel like that\u2019s soft enough either lol. you didn\u2019t do anything maliciously but he\u2019s at an age where this is really going to be tough to process. The thing is I can\u2019t guarantee the healthy or not healthy roots for length of this and what point you should be concerned BUT being someone who also had a parent bail, we try and cope however we can and he\u2019s lucky to have you in his life and clearly adores and values you. So I understand why you were worried and why you said what you said, but might be worth leaving a little wiggle room for this as he grows and heals he will understand the truth and right now you are his hero.

My younger brother (let's call him X) in question is 6.\n\nMy father (49) has been in and out of our lives for the past 6 years. He was working abroad and providing for us during that time, but us kids have slowly started to forget his presence around the house. In 2021, he had a huge fight with my mother and decided to leave us under the guise of \"visiting his relative's funeral\". We haven't seen him since. My siblings and I have had to help my mother (48) raise X.\n\nX always used to call me by my name, but recently he's picked up the habit of calling me dad. I felt very awkward at first, but after some thought I figured it was an honest mistake and  didn't pay much attention to it.\n\nIt didn't stop there. X started calling me dad more, whether it was in private or whether it was in front of the family. I was extremely confused.\n\nEarlier this afternoon, I picked him up from his school. When we reached home, I went to my mother and jokingly said \"This random child has been following me the entire time, I think he's lost.\" (We have a way of joking that I think is pretty wholesome, I'm sure he enjoys it too).\n\nX playfully tugged me on the arm and said \"How dare you say that! I'm your son\". \n\nNow here's where I might be TA. I didn't want him to grow up believing that I was something I'm not, so I gently responded \"X, I'm not your dad. I'm your older brother, OK? We share the same mother.\"\n\nX replied \"You're my dad now, because my real dad is never coming back.\" Hearing that tore my heart and I didn't know how to respond. I hugged him but he didn't seem too happy and left.\n\nMy mother pulled me aside later and told me that I shouldn't have said what I said. I tried to explain that as much as I understand his feelings, I wanted him to know who we truly are to each other and didn't want to devastate him later in life. I also mentioned how awkward it made me feel. She said that maybe X is calling me dad not because I'm his actual father, but maybe because I'm the safest masculine example he's got.\n\nUpon reflection, I'm starting to feel very guilty about what I did and I need some people to talk sense into me.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA. I think you handled it really well. Keeping in mind he is 6 he will also probably gradually grow out of it and into a better realization. But I thunk your response was perfectly loving and informing and tender even with hugging. \n\nI am on the side of your whole family here. No one is TA. I DO wonder what your mom is thinking though. \n\nMy mom avoided conflict to the point of damage in my family. It was much more vile than this (dad was a predator, mom was afraid to leave but eventually did)  but i do wonder how single moms feel. Back against the wall. Wanting to keep the peace. \n\nI think you are stellar.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is right when she told you are his safest male examples, but you need to draw a line respectfully like you did. Because he may expects things from you that you are not capable of giving since you are only 19. \n\nYour mother's heart is in the right place, but she doesn't see how not correcting  your brother could lead to more confusion and resentment for him.", "NTA you seemed fairly kind about how ya went about it. \nSounds like a decent time to talk about father figures, male role models, and so on.\nMake sure he steers clear from those role models that promote misogyny or any groomers. Ain\u2019t gonna name any names but y\u2019all know what\u2019s up.", "NTA\n\nYour mum now needs to step in and take more of a parental role. What will happen when you move out, and have your own family? Your poor brother will feel abandoned again. \n\nYour dad is a massive wanker, but your mum is also a bit wrong for parentifying you", "Nta it\u2019s very unfair of her to push you into this role. You did absolutely nothing wrong.", "NTA. Man you\u2019re a good dude. Get you all some therapy please.", "NTA", "NTA. It's good that you told him, you needed to know that he knew you aren't his real dad. He apparently knows that, but likes calling you dad anyway. Now you have to decide whether you're ok with that or not. I would be fine with it, as long as he knows you're not his real dad, but I can also imagine it's uncomfortable, so you need to make your own decision in that.", "omg poor Ed :(\n\nnta though", "NTA, the kid deserves to be told the truth. otherwise very hard and awkward situations could happen later in life. And he reacted nicely didn't he? Your mom has no right to hide the fact you are his brother", "NTA\n\nOlder brothers can also be a safe masculine role model too! It would be good to clear up that you are not his father. But his older brother.\n\nAnd of course, it doesn't mean you love him any less. At the end of the day, you're all family.", "NTA. Important to reinforce your history big brother. I have a nephew that used to call me dad. I explained to him that I'm his uncle and it eventually sunk in and he got over it.", "NTA. I've been candid with my kids since they could talk. I've had to have unpleasant conversations with my son at 6 too. You did the right thing. Mom's right too, in that your the next closest thing he has as a masculine rule model. He'll adjust. Complete the conversation with him, though. Let him know that just like him, you lost dad, too. But unlike dad, you'll always be there for him. Maybe let him open up to you about his feelings to help him process things,  as I can imagine Mom isn't in a place to put him in therapy. But that's what they would do anyway... get him to talk and process while they listen. You can do that for free as big bro. \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA \n\nYou did nothing wrong. Your mom should be the one to actually talk to him. Not you. You are her child. She should be talking to Ed and explaining everything. She should also be putting him in therapy, because this obviously effecting him a lot. \n\nI worry that if she lets this continue that it will get worse. We see a lot of stories on here where a older sibling is helping raise their younger sibling. When they have a family of their own. The younger sibling gets mad or upset. They feel replaced. I think it would be healthier to really make sure that he knows you are his sibling and not his parent.", "NTA", "NTA.  It's important that this does not continue.", "NTA.\n\nWhat about asking him to call you BroDad?", "NTA, but, please, if you believe it to be true, tell him that you, as his older brother, will be there for him. You are not his father, but you are the man he looks to when figuring out his own life and feelings as he grows. The only responsibilities you really have are just to be there as a role model, someone to lean on and someone who can listen to him as he figures his own life out. It sounds as if you are already filling that spot in his heart.", "NTA.... you've been put in a tough situation. The only thing that would make you an AH is the tone in which you said it. The way you wrote the incident sounds like you gently corrected him in a way to say hey I'm your big brother not your dad....there is absolutely nothing wrong with what you did. If you were in the middle of an argument and said it to upset him intentionally, although you are correct that would not have been appropriate as he is still trying to sort things out at his young age. Maybe find ways to encourage him to look at you as his brother. Have sibling outings with a focus on brotherhood.", " NTA, but this is something that needs to be addressed. Obviously your little brother sees you as the main male figure in his life, and I applaud you for stepping up for him. He wants to show that you are more than a big brother to him. Your role in his life is more impactful than that. Maybe you two can put your heads together and come up with a nickname that you\u2019re comfortable with, but leaves him with the sense that you\u2019re more than just his brother. This could lay a foundation for a lifetime of love and closeness that few others have achieved. It\u2019s an honor. Use the moment for both of you to grow.", "NTA. It\u2019s an understandably very awkward situation. You didn\u2019t yell or get mad. You just told him the truth, kindly.", "NTA.\n\nYou are allowed to have boundaries. You are not his father, and having your brother call you dad is making you uncomfortable.\n\nAnd also think your mother isn't thinking about how awkward it would be to explain to people why your little brother is calling you dad.\n\nYou are not a replacement for your father, and your mother also needs to comes to terms with that.", "My heart breaks for this kid who wants a dad. The real dad is the AH, you are NTA. Just a kid trying to be a good brother.", "Definitely NTA, the abscent Dad is the real asshole", "NTA. Your brother is struggling with some deep and painful emotions. His young mind does not have the tools to understand it. Why has his dad gone? Why do all the other kids have dads and he doesn't? Why can't you just be his dad? Whats wrong with him that made dad go? \n\nCalling you dad solves all those problems and makes answering those questions unnecessary. For now. And one day it will unravel, and it will cause deep psychological harm. \n\nBecause his dad is gone. You aren't his dad. \n\nYour mom is doing the same. But its vital to understand this lie won't resolve the problem. \n\nI'd suggest therapy but im guessing your dad disappearing hasn't left you rich, so you're gonna have to sit down with him, and try and explain it. \n\nFirst your dad leaving has nothing to do with him. It has everything to do with your dad. \n\nSecond, he has a big brother, which is frankly better than a dad in many ways. Look at the ways humans describe the closest relationships - its always brother and sister. \n\nThird to make up for Dad being a prick, you all have to love each other extra. \n\nThen you all probably need to cry together. Your dad disappearing is absolutely fucked.", "NTA. While your brother\u2019s feelings are understandable, it\u2019s important that he knows you are his sibling not his parent. If he\u2019s allowed to keep calling you \u201cdad\u201d and views you as his father, he\u2019s going to be crushed all over again when you eventually move out and start living life as an independent adult. Time to have talks with both your brother and your mom, and make it clear that you will always be his brother and will always be there for him, but you are not his parent and it\u2019s not healthy for him to see you as such.", "NTA. I can see why you wouldn\u2019t want him to get confused about family roles but it seems from the way he explained it that he does understand you aren\u2019t actually his dad, but he\u2019s looking for a father figure because his father isn\u2019t there for him anymore. However, your mother should be helping him to process this and not blaming you for not knowing what to say in that situation. Just emphasise you\u2019ll always be there for him.", "NTA\n\nthat\u2019s heartbreaking, but he can also open up the idea of what a \u201cfather figure\u201d is. You don\u2019t have to be a dad to be that role for him, you can be the best big bro ever.\n\nMaybe for him, \u201cdad\u201d will be be someone that doesn\u2019t carry as much meaning. There\u2019s a lot of kids that grow up with a similar situation (a parent not in the picture).", "It's okay that you don't want to be parentified. Family dynamics are complex but in general it's not great if that's what going on in your family.", "Sorry but by law people are required to call you dad if you say dad jokes.\n\nSeriously though NTA.\n\nBetter to nip this in the bud early, than deal with a bigger problem later.", "NTA 6 is old enough to understand that you aren\u2019t his biological father, but if you want you can be a sort of father figure to him if you want to.", "NTA and your mother has issues.", "NTA. \n\nThere's something called parentification where older siblings start taking on the attributes of a missing parent. Your mother seems to be unknowingly encouraging this because she may not understand that it can be harmful. \n\nFollow your gut: this is making you uncomfortable for a good reason.", "NTA, I understand where you mother is coming from. She was still wrong tho (or should it be N-A-H ?). You were also right cuz you are not his father. People could judge you cuz of that and you wouldn\u2019t want that. For the brother, he doesn\u2019t know any better. But he needs to learn.", "NTA. Your reasoning for the correction was 100% compassionate. Whether you corrected him or not was irrelevant, the intention and love is what mattered.", "NTA your mother is wrong your brother shouldn\u2019t be calling you dad ..you need to talk to him alone about this and reiterate to him that you are not his dad you are his brother and you will always be there for him to help and guide him as best as you can as his big brother not his dad.. every time he does it after that talk make sure you correct him, gently.", "NTA. \n\nIt would be best to get the labels is corrected now so you can avoid very awkward situations  where would he call you \"dad\", your mom \"mom\" and you call your mom \"mom. Imagine trying to explain to people to correct it.\n\nSince he is 6 and can't understand the depth of it all, I'd suggest watching Lilo and Stitch together. Explain that sometimes brothers and sisters help raise younger siblings and that you love him. I'd explain that even though Dad isn't the greatest and that he decide to not be around anymore, that you will always be there for him, as his brother.\n\n \u201cOhana means family. Family means nobody gets left behind or forgotten\u201d", "YTA - Although obviously you weren't trying to be. But I don't think it was necessary.

Maybe name your brother \u201cmy wanna be son\u201d or something humorous.", "NTA.  You are right to remind Ed that you are his brother, not his father.  Mom is wrong, she should reinforce this, too.  You can still be a fine example to your brother as his brother.  Ed is probably heartbroken and confused about your dad leaving.  It is ok to explain things to your little bro.", "NTA. Facing reality is a good skill to have, and as much as it pains all of us normal people when little kids need to face really harsh realities, this is what happens and it's psychologically healthy to learn to deal with it. Additionally, this is a situation where the kid can learn that others can't be made to twist themselves into a role inappropriate for them (or just one that they don't want) just to spare the kid and wrap him in a protective cocoon. It will be good for Ed to learn to never expect this from others.\n\nAll good coming-of-age and learning of boundaries. A bit early, but it does happen to some of us.", "NTA - and this prevents confusion later on in life. More importantly - I think it needs to be explored where Ed is coming from.", "Nta.  The one thing I would add to that conversation with Ed is that you are his big bro and you will always be there for him. He's been abandoned by his real dad and wants to replace him.  Let him know that you will be there no matter what but that you are his big bro and that will never change", "NTA, \n\nI feel greatly for you, but want to first give you so much love and respect for how you have helped raise your brother - to the point that he sees you as a father figure. As awkward as that title may feel, and how hard this must be, you are making your brother feel safe, secure, loved and supported. \n\nYou are right not to confuse your brother and clarify that you are not his dad - but you may want to take this opportunity to talk to your brother about how loved and supported he is. That there is a difference between a dad and a father, you have to earn the respect for that title and while you may not be his 'dad', you can be a father figure, you will teach him the things that fathers do and that you will always be there for him. \n\nHe is likely assuming that dad means something more and it hurt when you didn't take that title - your brother needs reassurance that you love him as much as possible, you are not leaving and you will always support him - like many father's do, you just have the title of awesome brother. Just because you are not his dad, does not mean that he means any less to you - maybe you want a nickname, maybe he wants a title more than brother to show how much he loves *you*.", "Maybe use a special nickname like Baddy - my brother who is like a dad? Brady?", "NTA - but you should probably reassure him that as the primary male role figure in his life that you\u2019ll not abandon him. It broke my heart the line of \u201cmy real dad is never coming back\u201d. He\u2019s trying to find safety, and you probably need to gently explain that doesn\u2019t change on whether he\u2019s calling you dad or not.", "NTA but I think the kid might need some counseling. He\u2019s obviously not coping great with the situation. \n\nThere are ways to help him work through this without forcing you, his 19 year old brother, to be called his dad when you aren\u2019t comfortable.", "NTA. You AREN\u2019T his Dad.", "NTA", "NTA. Your Ed's big bro, NOT his dad. You told him that in a very gentle but firm way, and need to keep telling him that. Be there for him, but don't become his parent. Your mom needs to stop trying to parentify you and get your brother counseling to help him properly deal with his father's abandonment. Not to mention, what's gonna happen when you move out later? Will Ed see that as being abandoned by another dad? Without being able to properly process the life changes, your mom risks Ed not being well-adjusted as he grows up.", "NAH\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for what you\u2019re going through. Maybe a nickname you and Ed are comfortable with would do? Something he can call you as a term of endearment, and is unique to you two. Off the top of my head, not knowing your name, maybe Bru (play off Minions Gru and Bro) lol", "NTA. I think it's natural for a child of his age to make this assumption based on his understanding of parental roles. You should make sure to draw the distinction between yourselves in a delicate matter that helps him understand who you are in his life - just do your best to approach it softly :-).\n\nAlso I can kind of relate as my older brother is 12 years older than me (I'm currently 30 and he's 42) so growing up, I had a similar dynamic with my brother who often times provided a comparable level of support to me as a father would (our dad was in our lives, but just wasn't the best dad). \n\nI can't say I recall calling my brother \"dad\" though other folks thought he was my dad at times because he was always there. I am so thankful for my older brother, he was and continues to be my biggest supporter and I love him to death. As you both grow older, I'm sure your brother will show you just how much you mean to him. Kudos to you OP for being an awesome big brother!", "Nope nope nope nope nope. Nope. \n\nNTA.\n\nEd is a kid. His dad left, and he\u2019s confused, and probably a little scared. Ed is fine. \n\nYour mother, however, is not. This was her parenting moment. Actually no, her parenting moment came the first time she heard Ed call you dad. She should have shut that down IMMEDIATELY. \n\nI suspect that your mother is letting you play \u2018dad\u2019 because it\u2019s easier than explaining where your dad actually is. I also suspect that Ed\u2019s reasoning is not entirely his own - it just sounds a little too adult. \n\nI get that your mum is hurting. I get that you\u2019re all stressed. I get that your dad is the AH here. But allowing Ed to call you dad isn\u2019t good for either you or Ed. It\u2019s heartbreaking, and you shouldn\u2019t have to do it, but keep correcting him. It\u2019s in both of your best interests.", "NTA- If you don\u2019t want the title of Dad that is totally okay. Your younger brother is trying to find a masculine figure to fill in the gap and have that father bond with. It seems like you are doing a great job being there for him, and you can fill the \u201cfather\u201d role without being his actual father. Maybe see if y\u2019all can come up with something else he can call you that makes y\u2019alls relationship special because that\u2019s all he\u2019s wanting. His friends likely have Dads and thats a special relationship so he wants one too.", "NTA\n\nYour actual \u201cDad\u201d put you all in a terrible situation. You seem to have assumed a lot of his roles as a father figure to your brother. However, wanting to clearly establish a boundary and delineating your role in his life will be important for him to understand your family\u2019s dynamics as he grows up. It will lessen confusion for other people as well who may not know your family, like teachers or classmates parents. \n\nKeep being the best you can to your little bro and help him understand that you will always be there for him but you are not his father. Your mom is right about the reason he is calling you Dad but that doesn\u2019t mean you need to use the title. He is a young confused kid and making sure he knows your not his Dad now will eliminate any confusion when he\u2019s older.", "This left me tearful\n\nNAH Can't call anybody here an asshole.", "NTA. You had to make a tough decision, but you made the right one and did so the best way you could.", "NTA. Have a talk with Ed and tell him how much you live him and that you will also be there for him.

Maybe you guys can come up with a nick name together that he could use.?", "Parentification ususally happens when older daughters are expected to parent younger siblings in large families.  It's not healthy it that situation and it's not healthy here.\n\nThere's a clear line that needs to be drawn.  It's very kind of OP to be a \"masculine role model\" for Ed, but HE IS NOT ED'S DAD.  \n\nThis is not Ed's fault and this is not OP's fault --mom is the AH in this story.  Kudos to OP for being a kind and generous older brother, but OP has a life and needs to move on (he can still be a big influence in Ed's life and an even better role model as an independent adult). Mom needs to find another solution for help with Ed.", "OP, you should watch the last episodes of The Rehearsal.", "Honey, no. You\u2019re not the asshole. You\u2019re a teenager. I\u2019m not sure why upvotes are seemingly locked, but you did nothing wrong. Ed isn\u2019t upset with you. He\u2019s upset about the situation, and he\u2019s so little that this is the only way he knows how to cope. The asshole here is your dad, and to a small degree, your mom. Don\u2019t get me wrong here, I can see how hard your mother tries and how much she loves you guys. It\u2019s obvious she\u2019s just doing the best she can in a difficult situation, and no parent is perfect. I\u2019m really not trying to crap talk your mother, I promise. But.. the #1 thing I noticed in this post is that through all the trauma ALL of you guys had to endure from your father (including your mom), I haven\u2019t seen one mention of counseling. Not individual counseling for any of you, or family counseling for ALL of you. I completely understand that maybe you guys don\u2019t have a ton of resources, but your mom needs to get on the internet and do some research to find a child and family counselor or therapist who either\nA: works with your insurance (if you guys have it), or \nB: is INCOME BASED and will work with your mother to find an affordable price! \nAnd if she can\u2019t find a program in your area that is specific to family counseling that will work with you guys, she needs to find individual child counseling for Ed that is willing to, from there, work with you and your mother for a few group sessions with him. \nI\u2019m not gonna be too hard on your mom here, especially considering that many people don\u2019t realize that income based counseling exists. You have to look kinda hard to find it. But they work on a sliding pay scale based on your proof of income, and they can be a lifesaver. No, they aren\u2019t free. But they CAN be implemented into the budget. \nMy point here is, you and your siblings are absolute angels for stepping up to help your family in the way you have. But your mother can not expect you to fully take on the role of a parent to Ed. That is by definition, parentafication and will only do a world of damage to your mental health long term. While I understand her wanting to help her youngest child through this hard time in the best way she can, parentifying you is not the way to do it. First of all, that is sacrificing YOUR mental health for the sake of Ed\u2019s which on its own is never okay. You can\u2019t sacrifice the mental health of your oldest child for the sake of your youngest. But second of all, it\u2019s not dealing with the root of Ed\u2019s problem or helping him to heal at all! Ed is struggling, and he needs professional counseling along with the love and support he\u2019s getting. And it\u2019s your mothers responsibility to get that for him, not yours. ALL you can do is be there for your brother. He\u2019s so young and obviously, can\u2019t grasp the situation in the same way the rest of you can. While it obviously hurts about the same for everyone, it\u2019s probably a lot more confusing for him on some level. All he understands is that dad left. He doesn\u2019t understand how to even exit with that knowledge the way you and your siblings do, let alone cope! Which is why his mindset is \u201cif I can\u2019t have my real daddy, I have to replace him,\u201d because Ed doesn\u2019t know how to function with the knowledge that he doesn\u2019t have a dad! \nIn summary, no, OP. You\u2019re NTA. Far from it. But talk to your mom about family counseling.", "never mind when the 19 yr old also calls her 'Mom'", "Exactly. Obviously Ed is unaware of the connotations, but there are people out there who would absolutely take that at face value and make assumptions. If Ed says this at school, I could see an over-zealous teacher making assumptions about abuse and calling CPS.", "Ed knows their father abandoned them, their mother is taking the easy way out. What happens when OP decides to move out, get a partner, have kids if they want.\n\nBy not addressing this now and doing so in a healthy manner the mother is basically pawning off emotional work that will see huge damage done when OP moves out, because in Ed's head two fathers will have bailed on him.", "Agreed. You\u2019re right that a not healthy attachment is forming - and this could get OP\u2019s mom into some trouble at points. OP is let the brother go through a phase, but now it\u2019s at a point where it should be looked at more closely and the brother should get help. The mom is wrong for letting this happen (though I\u2019m struggling to call her the AH, as it sounds like she has a lot on her plate and would need more info to pass judgement)", "Another concern is that at age 19, OP needs to be doing things that will enable him to be independent one day, whether college, starting a career, etc.\n\nIt's fine to be helpful with little bro, but much less so if Mom has an expectation that OP will always be present. \n\nImposing a Dad role on OP is clearly something that would tie him down, and that is not ok.", "Especially when he calls her mom too...", "This. The NAH votes are missing the fact that the mom is completely in the wrong here for encouraging OP to allow it to continue.", "Agreed. Important to hold the boundary that he is not the father. \n\nHowever, is there a way to honour and accommodate Ed\u2019s emotional needs for this type of connection and the appreciation he is trying to express toward OP? As one example, talking to Ed about choosing a different special \u201cname\u201d or term of endearment that they both feel comfortable with.", "Don\u2019t you think a single parent has it hard enough? They can only do so much and if OP loves his family enough to step up he absolutely should. This is exactly what family is about.

You might tell your little brother that Dad might be a confusing title, but that you two can make up a special nickname for him to call you. Maybe he can have one, too. You\u2019ll have a special title, and the both of you will have a special bond that no one else has. Examples might be: \u201cSkipper/Private; BB or D2/LB; Grunk/Dunk; Don/Michael; Bubba/Lubba. You see where I\u2019m going. I would also make it clear that to say you don\u2019t want to be his Dad is completely untrue.

It's not fair to impose even more weight on your shoulders. You're his older brother - and a very good one, from what you describe - and it's not your place to take on another role, especially given your age...you're still a teenager! \n\nWhat your brother needs is therapy to deal with the loss of his father...it must be difficult for him to process the whole divorce and understand that his father isn't around, so it's good to have external help so that he can understand his new family dynamic, and that he has a mother who loves him unconditionally and an excellent older brother who will always be there for him.", "NTA you did the right thing.", "Yeah I want to add on that maybe making up a special name that isn't dad for him to call OP might be nice. I see it remmended for step parents sometimes. Like \"captain\". It shows the special bond without being an existing title since most English speaking siblings don't call each other \"brother\"", "> It's difficult for kids that age to see their friends with their fathers and not understand why they don't have a dad\n\nI rationalized this so strangely as a child. My \"father\" left while my mother was still pregnant with me. He was and is a guinea worm of a human being. Not worthy of anything except what he brings upon himself. My mother's best friend at the time got divorced right after she had her son, too. So in my childish mind, it made sense that a man and woman get married - which they must do if they want children - and the man stays with the woman while she's having children. Once they're done having children, he leaves to make a new family with a new woman and the cycle repeats. I thought the reason that my uncle was still in my cousins' lives was because my aunt was simply not done having children (Quiverfull...), and same for every other relatives.\n\nWhen we moved to the States (this was in the Ukrainian SSR), I saw that my uncle was still with my aunt and their youngest kid was my age. I was so confused. Why hadn't he moved on? My aunt was done, after all. So I approached my mom and asked her and she looked just devastated that this was my reality the entire time. She explained that my \"father\" leaving like he did wasn't what good fathers do (but also that not every father who stays is necessarily a \"good\" father, either just for staying) and it's not something that should have happened. It completely upended everything I thought to be true, because I was already envisioning that I'd get older, get married, have kids, and then be a single mother.\n\nGeez, what a ride. All thanks to my \"father\".\n\nBut, u/HamstringHunter - NTA. At all. I had a bit of a different experience where people thought my grandfather was my father (he did actually raise us alongside our mother and was in actuality my father-figure), but I felt weird when people misinterpreted the Russian \"ded\" (for \"grandfather\") as \"dad\" and so they thought that my grandfather was my mother's husband and not father. It was awkward. And then when I was 12, my mother had my half-brother and I took care of him a lot and when I went out to parks with him I did get mistaken for his mother and I didn't like that. It was awkward and uncomfortable and just... wrong. I didn't want my brother to get the wrong idea, either so I always shut it down.\n\nLetting your brother believe you're his father is much more harmful than gently telling him the truth, in my opinion. You didn't do anything wrong and I think you handled it gently and in a loving manner. I'd say go over to him and have a long and serious talk about how much he means to you, but you are not a father - not to him or anyone else. But you will always have his back as his older brother.", "Agree, NTA.

You are also coping with your dad abandoning you and your family. It seems like you took on quite a role of responsibility, while you were still a kid. Be kind to yourself, don\u2019t burn out.

This revelation is new and they\u2019re trying to wrap their heads around it. \n\nI say this because there may be an aspect of what he\u2019s hearing at school coming into play. Other kids may talk about their Dads doing things with them and such. This may be his way of \u201cfitting in\u201d by calling you dad.  To him, you have been the person to kind of fill same role in his life.  So this might be a more complex issue than it appears. \n\nWith that said. You are still a kid yourself. It\u2019s not really your responsibility to understand how to field this kind of thing. I think it\u2019s incredible sweet that you and your brother have a close relationship, but I completely understand where you\u2019re coming from with the dad thing. Good for you to set some boundaries for yourself too. I think you put more thought into the implications of him calling you dad, more than a lot of kids your age would. You\u2019re a good kid. \n\nI don\u2019t think your mom was totally right by telling you, you were to hard on him. She should probably step in and have a conversation with him about how he feels about all of this. It might not be a bad idea for you to have a sit down with him as well.  Although kids don\u2019t understand it all, especially the nuances to situations, they pick up more than we give them credit for. \n\nLet him know how you feel and why. And let him open up to why he calls you dad and why it\u2019s important to him. You undoubtedly are an important person to him. And although he won\u2019t understand everything you explain, it\u2019s a good start to keeping open communication. Especially as you get older and do things with your life. You may go to college. Or move out on your own. I wish you all the best. This is a loaded situation for everyone involved. And most definitely above Reddit\u2019s pay grade. But hopefully it gives you a different perspective.", "NTA\n\nHe wants to be like everyone - he wants someone to call dad. And of course he would pick you. But it is better that he doesn't. Others here have described why that is. You can be a father figure to him, though. Be the best one you can. \n\nIt might be good to get some counseling.", "NAH (except for your dad) You are probably the closest thing that your brother has to a dad. It's OK if you don't want the title. The conversation had to have happen at some point and the sooner the better.", "NTA. I just came here to say that you deserve a standing ovation for being such an awesome big brother. Ed is blessed to have you, you absolutely rock.", "NAH. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy for him to call you Dad. Maybe the two of you could choose a special nickname for him to call you. Maybe one for you to call him, too. I don\u2019t blame your Mom for having that reaction. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s totally overwhelmed. Good on you for being there for your family.", "NTA\n\n\"We don't need to confuse Ed. I'm sure he wants a father figure, but I am not that. I am his older brother, and I don't mind being someone he looks up to as a older-male figure, but that doesn't make me his dad. It makes me his older brother. Period. I am not going to keep up the delusion of playing his father when I am very simply put, not that. That's not healthy for either of us, and I don't appreciate you trying to guilt me into it. It's not my fault dad walked away, just as much as it isn't Ed's fault, but I am not going to be put into a position where I am raising my own brother like a son. That's weird and not a healthy dynamic.\"", "NTA\n\nBut here's the thing kids don't understand what mom and dad really mean at that age. Those are just roles to be filled. I am a recovering addict and I had a relapse when my son was 8 and he was taken away from me (his dad was absent from birth so it was just me). And he was gone a year and lived with my sister and BIL. While I was in rehab he started calling them mom and dad. He still called me mom when he saw me, but it just made sense in his mind to call the man and woman he was living with mom and dad. I didn't correct him because I wanted him to just get through the difficult situation that I had caused. \n\nYour situation is much different though. You're doing the right thing by correcting him and I think as long as you can be loving and supportive in the way you continue to correct him then it will be a positive thing. Try to help him understand that families come in all shapes and sizes. Some families have only one parent and a grandparent at home. Some families have an uncle and aunt at home. And so on and so on. Mom, Dad, and kids aren't the only template for a family. \n\nAnd I think another important thing you could do is to validate his feelings of not having a dad in the way that you both are missing a dad. Obviously do it in an age appropriate way as he gets older. But it's important for him to know that not only are you his big brother who he can look up to for his understanding of what a man should be, but that also you can share in his pain, loss, and confusion about you dad not being a part of your life. And your mom really needs to get on board with this to avoid hurting him in any way. The best way forward is to approach this situation with truth and love in a way a 6 year old can understand.", "NAH.\nI hope everything works out for you all.", "NTA.  You are being a great big brother... but it's fine if you are uncomfortable being called dad, and it feels like your mom is putting a lot on you by asking you to accept it.  I think it's fine to tell your brother how you love him and you will always be there for him, those are all things a big brother can do.  I worry, even if you were okay with it, that recasting you as \"dad\" is setting him up for more loss when you inevitably move out, go away to school, get married, or otherwise do things that it's normal and healthy for a young man to want to do.", "NTA I don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy that he call you dad. He clearly is having a hard time with your father leaving you guys. your mom needs to get him into therapy if you guys can. He might not being dealing with it at all if he is transferring all his feelings onto you", "NTA but a little more compassion is needed on your part. This little kid witnesses everyone else having a male figure to call dad. You are your brothers male figure. You need to start having more conversations with him about it. I know it makes you uncomfortable but you need to have (probably) multiple convos with him and let him know it's okay if he needs to call you dad. Kids just want to be like other kids. Also, he may decide in a month or so he doesn't want to call you that. Lol.", "NTA at all. I think it was handled as well as it could be with a 6 year old. You said your piece, he said he knows but he sees you as a dad, you hugged, and I think he's alright. If you really want to sit down with him and say something like \"Hey bud, I don't know if I hurt your feelings when I said I wasn't your dad, but I didn't mean to at all. I just didn't want for you to be confused and wanted to make sure you knew before you got too old. I love that you see me as a dad figure. I'll always be here for you no matter what. You and me til forever.\"\n\nHe knows you're his stable dude. 10/10, bro.\n\nI saw someone else suggested coming up with a different name between the two of you instead of dad but isn't just your name. I love that idea.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you are standing in for Dad to him, but it also makes sense you aren't comfortable being called Dad.  Gently telling him, \"I'm your brother, and it makes me uncomfortable being called Dad\" does not make you an AH.", "NTA. It\u2019s okay to set a boundary, especially because you did it gently. Your mom should have backed you up and added clarity to it for him. Don\u2019t feel guilty - you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I think that feeling may stem from sympathy rather than responsibility.", "NTA. Heartbreaking that that happened but YOU are NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour brother needs to understand that you are his brother. You will do your best to help your mother with him. You love him but, you are his brother.", "Have you considered changing it up and making it fun and less awkward for your little brother. For example, maybe tell him you're honoured that he looks up to you like a Dad, but that it would be way cooler if he called you something else that's special like \"Mega bro\" (or something to the effect that isn't \"Dad\" but makes him happy that he is giving you a special status in his life) beyond a regular older brother.\n\nAlso you're definitely NTA here.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. Allowing him to continue referring to you as Dad just adds to his confusion. I would check with the school to see if there is counseling available.", "This is the first step to OP being guilted into taking fatherly duties full on. \n\nIt\u2019s great that he\u2019s helping his and his brother\u2019s actual parent, by going above and beyond as a brother.   But nobody, especially his mom, should feel this is something to be expected from OP, and not the generous gift that it is. \n\nNTA. OP\u2019s feelings matter as much as his brother\u2019s.", "I agree with your comment about 'safest masculine' role model.  Personally I'd let it slide but remember, a lot of responsibility can come with the title of 'dad'.  NTAH.", "Yta I understand this is a touchy subject, but you being the older male figure should\u2019ve had more understanding and poise to deal with the situation", "NTA - you are barely out of \u201cchildhood\u201d yourself and have also experienced the same trauma as your little brother. \nI would not expect someone your age to be able to explain to a six year old the family dynamics and nuances you\u2019re experiencing. \nI think you can talk to your little brother and tell him that even though you\u2019re not is Dad you\u2019re his brother and that\u2019s even more important! Brothers have a very special bond. Tell him how much you love him and will protect him. Maybe you can come up with an alternative nickname other than \u201cdad\u201d that you two can use. \n\nYour mother needs to step in here too; she is parentifying you and passing off her responsibility of explaining adult things to a young child to you. You\u2019re an adult on paper, but you are not \u201cthe adult\u201d in your family. \n\nKudos to you for being such an amazing brother; you\u2019re a good kid!", "NAH.  It might have been a little harsh, but I understand where you were coming from, and the kid clearly isn't an asshole.\n\nAnecdote time: My great-grandmother raised two of her grandchildren (their mother had walked out after their father was in a car accident that left him permanently disabled) from the time they were just babies until they both got married and moved out on their own. She was very clear with them that despite the fact that she took care of them like their mother would have done, she was \"Grammie\", *never* \"Mum.\"", "NTA. What your mother is doing is wrong. Whatever her reasons are, whether she feels guilty about the poor choice she made in man she had a baby with, or feels guilty about your brother not having a father, nothing justifies the confusion she's imposing on the two of you by trying to make you take up the father role in the family.", "NTA, it makes you uncomfortable and you VERY nicely told him to stop, of course he isn't going to be happy about it, but you should not have to deal with that. Your mom should not tell you to suck it up and disregard YOUR feelings, and perhaps should consider putting him into counseling? What she said puts way too much responsibility on you", "I\u2019m sorry but your mom is the ass here. She needs to get therapy and get therapy for all y\u2019all.", "NTA I can completely see your point, but also why your brother is hurt and confused that he doesn\u2019t have what he sees other kids having. \n\nThe best way I can think is to explain it to him positively, that some people have parents and some don\u2019t, but he has a big brother that loves him, and big brothers stay best friends forever. As a child, having an adult tell others that they\u2019re their best friend can make them feel special. Or have a nickname just for you two (where you give him a nickname too).", "In much of the US the name Bubba has become a  derogatory term associated with an uneducated and stupid person. It doesn't mean that for everyone.", "Maybe in addition to the special name, let him know that even though you are not actually his dad that you love him and you are willing to act like a dad for him when he needs you to.  Definitely NTA.", "NTA. I was 18 when my little brothers were 5, and I would never have allowed them to call me mom, or, think that I was their mom. My mom was in the picture, but, if she had not been, I definitely would not have allowed it.", "Do I actually have to explain this?\n\nA 6 year old child calls his 19 year old brother \"dad\" and they call the same woman \"mom.\" You don't think some overzealous teacher would assume the 19 year old brother had been sexually abused?\n\nI've seen it happen.\n\nI called my grandfather \"Dad\" when I was a kid because we lived with my grandparents and that's what my mother called him, so it was just easier. There was an old busybody at our church who went around telling people he was my father instead and starting rumors."]}
