E looked over at my test and said \u201cAww my uncle is so smart\u201d and she ruffled up my hair. I have a few friends in that class and they laughed along with a few other kids. She didn't say it super loud but loud enough for others to hear.

She left and I always take her to and from school and she didn't say anything in the car. \n\nWell, my mom got a call from my SIL saying how E was crying about what I said to her.
