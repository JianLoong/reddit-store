E looked over at my test and said \u201cAww my uncle is so smart\u201d and she ruffled up my hair. I have a few friends in that class and they laughed along with a few other kids.

She left and I always take her to and from school and she didn't say anything in the car. \n\nWell, my mom got a call from my SIL saying how E was crying about what I said to her.

My nephew who is less than a year younger than me never calls me by name.  Since we were kids he always called me \"Unc\" or \"Uncle\".

But he didn't.", "I don\u2019t actually think it is weird, I really don\u2019t care how anyone builds their family but I can understand it feeling like a weird dynamic to be seated next to your niece in HS where everybody is judging everybody all the time because they don\u2019t share the same maturity as adults and want to be seen as young and hot. If you like the term little aunt and she does too, more power to ya. The problem here is one person is uncomfortable.\n\nBut youre not weird and neither is your little aunt.", "E was being patronizing and teasing OP, then doubled down when OP tried to address it. I wouldn\u2019t want to be around/be associated with someone who crossed my boundaries and blamed me, either. It was harsh, but maybe E will see that just because they\u2019re tied by family doesn\u2019t mean she can treat him poorly and expect him to put up with it.", "The communication wasn\u2019t great but it\u2019s totally reasonable to not want to be the uncle of your peer in HS and have it called out to everyone. It\u2019s not the same as not loving someone, just an awkward dynamic in HS where everything is dramatic to begin with. And it does sound like she was giving him a bit of a hard time.", "Look at the original, unedited post where OP stated to be f17 (a typo he cleared but after I made the comment)", "[removed]", "If the teasing hurts someone, then it\u2019s not good natured. If E had good intentions, she\u2019d apologize and promise not to do that again. E didn\u2019t \u201cdo nothing wrong,\u201d she was teasing OP in a way OP didn\u2019t like, then when OP addressed the behaviors E didn\u2019t back down or apologize and said she was \u201cjust\u201d teasing OP. Lots of bullies \u201cjust tease\u201d by their own estimation. \n\nE\u2019s response is very telling as to her actual intentions; if she wanted to be affectionate then E should have followed OP\u2019s boundaries and apologized instead of playing the victim. Even outside of that, the act of ruffling OP\u2019s hair IS patronizing and just because some people may be okay with that or see it as a form of affection doesn\u2019t mean OP has to.", "No, unless you\u2019re talking to a group a female is called a woman not a women", ">If the teasing hurts someone, then it\u2019s not good natured.\n\nIf you do not expect the person to be hurt then it absolutely can still be good natured. What happens after that person tells you how they feel is when you get into whether or not it's good natured.\n\nYou don't seem to think E is sincere in any part of what went down -- but there's nothing in the post to indicate that's the case, even though the story is being told by the person who it happed to. Like even the \"just teasing\" statement is part of her asking why he's bothered. There's no reason to think she's not sincere in that question. She is just as likely to be hurt by being called annoying and him telling her he wishes he wasn't her uncle as he was by having his hair ruffled. There is no reason to think she's \"playing the victim.\" In fact, we KNOW he wasn't being good natured about it. He WAS trying to hurt her.", "How E responds with trying to excuse her behavior by saying she\u2019s \u201cjust teasing\u201d shows she\u2019s not being good natured. If she was then she\u2019d recognize it wasn\u2019t well received and apologized and make behavior changes. THAT is how good natured people handle when their \u201cteasing\u201d hurts someone. \n\nOP only says the mean comment after E refuses to back down or acknowledge that OP is upset by her actions and E makes it clear E doesn\u2019t care and would make the same choice to tease OP. It was hurtful, and E should learn from that or she will likely hear more comments like that in the future.", "\"Why? I'm just teasing\" does not show she isn't being good natured. She's asking why it bothers him. \n\nIt's also not \"refusing to back down\" -- it's asking a question. \n\nand the answer to that question was to go off on her. Which is definitely not good natured. \n\nOP also wasn't so much hurt as he was embarrassed -- because other kids laughed. He doesn't give us any other context for in, including whether or not they tease each like that regularly -- which might explain why she's surprised when he tells her not to call him uncle. \n\nI think you're projecting some stuff onto E that's rooted entirely in OP's reaction and not taking into consideration that his reaction might not have been proportional to what happened. From the details OP provides, there's no reason to think E was trying to upset him OR \"playing the victim\" to her parents.", "It doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out that other kids laughing will upset a high schooler. A mature and kind person would\u2019ve noticed the reaction and apologized without prompting, but as E is young I\u2019ll give her a pass on that. But then she was confronted and instead of acknowledging it, she questions OP and says she\u2019s just teasing him. That is when she should\u2019ve taken stock of the situation and apologized. \n\nAlso, this is all *if* E and OP had a close enough relationship already that E felt OP would be okay with her ruffling his hair in class. If they didn\u2019t then E is TA full stop, and it\u2019s also super patronizing which is not nice. \n\nE started off this whole interaction by being patronizing, even if she only meant it as lighthearted teasing. She ended up making OP uncomfortable/embarrassed/hurt. She should not have done that and should learn from this experience. \n\nIf they do tease each other like this regularly, then it\u2019s understandable how E behaved, but we don\u2019t have anything to suggest that. In fact, this is the first time E has called him uncle in school so it leans more towards this is a new development. If E was trying something new and it wasn\u2019t received well, then that\u2019s a mistake, but she becomes TA when she doesn\u2019t apologize.", "Look, all I'm saying is that you have chosen to look at E through a prism that is darker than the one the OP painted. You say there's nothing to suggest this is normal for them -- but it's as fair to note as a possibility as the dozen things you've put on the post that also aren't suggested. If you argument is that she was clearly patronizing and mean because of his reaction, then it's just as fair to say he overreacted because of  HER reaction. You don't know what her intention was. You are assuming it. And you are doing it unequally to the two parties. OP gets much more of the benefit of your doubt -- probably because you relate to this story from his POV. But you are putting motives and thoughts on E that OP doesn't and that aren't definite by any stretch of the imagination."]}
