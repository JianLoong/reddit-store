So of course having the same exact last name E and I sit next to each other. \n\nYesterday we got back a test and I got a B+ on it which was great for me. E looked over at my test and said \u201cAww my uncle is so smart\u201d and she ruffled up my hair. I have a few friends in that class and they laughed along with a few other kids. She didn't say it super loud but loud enough for others to hear.

She left and I always take her to and from school and she didn't say anything in the car. \n\nWell, my mom got a call from my SIL saying how E was crying about what I said to her.

Like even the \"just teasing\" statement is part of her asking why he's bothered. There's no reason to think she's not sincere in that question. She is just as likely to be hurt by being called annoying and him telling her he wishes he wasn't her uncle as he was by having his hair ruffled. There is no reason to think she's \"playing the victim.\" In fact, we KNOW he wasn't being good natured about it. He WAS trying to hurt her.", "How E responds with trying to excuse her behavior by saying she\u2019s \u201cjust teasing\u201d shows she\u2019s not being good natured.

Which is definitely not good natured. \n\nOP also wasn't so much hurt as he was embarrassed -- because other kids laughed. He doesn't give us any other context for in, including whether or not they tease each like that regularly -- which might explain why she's surprised when he tells her not to call him uncle. \n\nI think you're projecting some stuff onto E that's rooted entirely in OP's reaction and not taking into consideration that his reaction might not have been proportional to what happened.

But then she was confronted and instead of acknowledging it, she questions OP and says she\u2019s just teasing him.

In fact, this is the first time E has called him uncle in school so it leans more towards this is a new development.

You say there's nothing to suggest this is normal for them -- but it's as fair to note as a possibility as the dozen things you've put on the post that also aren't suggested. If you argument is that she was clearly patronizing and mean because of his reaction, then it's just as fair to say he overreacted because of  HER reaction. You don't know what her intention was. You are assuming it. And you are doing it unequally to the two parties. OP gets much more of the benefit of your doubt -- probably because you relate to this story from his POV.

OP was harsh saying he wished he wasn\u2019t her uncle, I agree with that. E was hurt by that and it\u2019s fair, but I still think E should have not started this or should\u2019ve been willing to apologize.

E clearly was not. E tried to tease OP but then couldn\u2019t acknowledge when OP was upset. It does not matter to me what E\u2019s initial intent/motives were (other than to tease, which she said to OP), it\u2019s the fact that when OP reacted badly, E didn\u2019t apologize and take responsibility. \n\nIf my baby brother reacted like OP did I\u2019d feel really bad *about the fact that I hurt or embarrassed him* because it would be out of character for him to respond that way and I\u2019d want to make it up to him. If my little sister responded that way (which she\u2019d be more likely to do than baby brother) I\u2019d probably have doubled down and teased her more or told her to get over it, which would have been an AH thing to do."]}
