However, there comes a point in the grieving process when they don't get to veto marriage/moving in just on general principle.

OP doesn't mention whether Mia's mother died, her parents divorced, or some other problem separated Mia's parents.", "Michael should jump ship. She might hold a grudge against Mia if she does something to piss her off.", "I think Viv's shell shock damaged her ability to connect emotionally and so she jumped into another marriage only a year later to keep from dealing with her pain, and therefore lacked the capacity to deal with anyone else's, including her own daughter. Only she has found herself in a non-marriage, perhaps by her own doing, maybe not (don't know too much about Michael other than OP's statement that he's equally unavailable to everyone). But part of me suspects his lack of involvement might be tied to Viv's venom. In assuming his perspective:  Sera doesn't accept him since Viv never cared enough to help her settle up with the idea,  so connecting is awkward at best; Viv's emotionally unavailable, and his little girl is quite taken by a woman doting on her. \n\n Viv lost the ability to connect to her daughter, perhaps because she still can't process her loss, and her daughter basically, for Viv, serves as a conduit to that pain. So the only thing Viv can do is focus on the one piece of distraction she has left,  Mia, which isn't fair to Mia, who since the age of 8, has had to basically be Viv's emotional support pet, which should never be a child's role or responsibility. Mia represents the new beginning Viv thought Michael would be for her and isn't tied to any grievance, so Viv is happy in this little world while blaming everyone else around her for those failing relationships.  And it's that perceived closeness that alienates Sera even more. Sounds like one bad hastily and emotionally made decision has caused nothing but 7 years of dysfunction, pain, and fractures. OP is doing all she can from the outside to bring Viv some much needed perspective and be supportive of her niece. That's no way an AH lol.  But this can't come from OP. Viv desperately needs the guidance of a very skilled therapist to bring her to these self revelations. Viv's upset (threatened?) by OP and Sera's closeness, but Sera's getting older and will continue to make her own choices.

And we didn't even lose our mom to death, she just left our lives. Viv was especially angry that our stepmom had two kids of her own and didn't want anything to do with them. She said she was a selfish little bitch back then too and realizes now they were the best thing to happen to us.\n\nI'm very curious to know what the relationship is between you, Viv, and your stepmom and her kids. Are you guys close now?", "NTA. Sera is old enough to consider emancipation. If it\u2019s that bad, & it sounds like it is, she could emancipate herself & move in with you. it is a process but she\u2019s being emotionally abused & likely wasn\u2019t fully able to process her grief about her dad dying. she needs to be away from her mother ASAP. Your sister could come around & heal this relationship, but it\u2019s not going to happen if they live together", "Definitely NTA. You have fair warned her of what the future could hold. Seems Viv wants to stay on this path so get ready for her to complain and moan when Sera goes low/no contact as soon as she graduates. Also be prepared to help Sera out because she's going to need family support for that transition to independence. You may have to go low contact as well if it's a choice between Viv or Sera.", "You are absolutely NTA. Viv sounds like she needs professional help for the trauma she seems to be carrying and the hole she is trying to fill. She will lose her daughter if she doesn\u2019t realise this in time.", "NTA and please please please don't listen to your sister and leave your niece alone\n\nShe needs someone in her corner", "NTA Viv seems like a really controlling piece of work and yes she is going to lose her daughter if she doesn\u2019t make changes. Unfortunately I\u2019m afraid she will learn the hard way.", "NTA but what you said is wrong on one account I'm pretty sure she's already lost that girl", "NTA.", "Hopefully Sera has you OP on speed dial,  sometimes we all need someone we trust to talk to.", "It seems to me that as the sister and aunt in this situation that you have some insight but are also on the outside making a lot of assumptions. Your input may not be accepted here so if you give it in a non perfect way you may look like the AH. Sera coming to you as an aunt with all this info is not helpful and maybe family therapy with her mom would be more productive.\n\nNAH", "Nta. Thx for being there for sera", "NTA\n\nAdults don't understand how much hurt their words can to do children. It's not the children being selfish it's the parents. When I was younger my mother started dating my future step father and I still remember her saying to us that we better not mess this up for her. It hurt so much to think that this guy she was dating was more important then us. Even after they got married we resented him.", "NTA, but I feel sorry for Viv too. She knows that Michael is not that invested in this marriage or in fatherhood, and this causes her to feel overprotective of Mia, and/or makes her think she needs to work hard for this marriage. With Sera she probably feels that \"I'm her mother, she has to love me anyway\". Be there for Sera when she needs you, I don't think you can change Viv.", "I mean, yeah, you sound reasonable but the reality is this is their immediate family and their issues to work through.  Stating an opinion can be fine but, imo, that's as far as your involvement can go.  You aren't an AH here though.", "Your NTA.  Your sister on the other hand sounds unbearable.", "Oh that girl is for sure gonna go no contact when she's 18. Ik that sounds like it's far but I have only called my mom once since I moved out for information on medical stuff. I'll be 19 soon", "Nta", "[removed]", "I hope Sera has a professional to talk to about this at some point. NTA", "My father was my hero, a stay at home dad, and my whole world until he walked out on us at 8", "You can't force kids into a \"new family.\" I see people do this all the time trying force relationships and famlial relationships. They have to build their own.", "I'm so sorry you went through this. I really don't understand this \"deprive another girl of a mother\" bit, as if they(step-moms) were chosen for some holy role instead of... You know, marrying the girl's dad. Life already deprived her of a mother, and it's nice for someone to step up and play that role, but not at the expense of their own child. You wouldn't have been depriving Gina of anything; you didn't kill her mom! This is just such a weird angle your mom and Viv took, especially since they can apparently only mother one daughter at a time.", "That's just not a thing you can force on other people -- and children are people. So if the parent wants a healthy blended family, they will respect that no child gets over their grief in a measly one year, and slow their roll.", "Exactly how hard is it to just stay single for the rest of your life. That\u2019s what old sister should have done", "NTA your sister ruined her family and I feel has already lost her daughter,", "There no good reason to ever remarry after a divorce it\u2019s just not worth the risk. They should consider passing laws banning it", "Viv did not necessarily need to live un-partnered.\n\nBut that partner did not necessarily need to be moved in to cohabitate, along with his daughter.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with Viv dating, while keeping a separate household from her partner, in order to provide stability for both Sera and Mia. \n\nRomantic partnerships can take many different forms, and change form over time.  Sera's \"not now\" was not the same as \"never.\"  Viv rushing into the new relationship in the form of cohabitating families primarily served to change Sera's \"not now for sharing a home\" into a \"never.\"\n\nIt's a case where asking too much means that you'll be given nothing.  Ask a coworker to borrow a dollar so you can get a coffee?  You  might get a yes, or a no.   Ask the coworker for $100 to cover a nice dinner out?  You're getting a firm  \"no,\" which will almost certainly remain \"no\" even if you reduce the request to a dollar for coffee.", "I think she should be more compassionate toward her daughter and work on their relationship. I think she should make her daughter feel loved, and tell her she loves her even if she never loves Mia.", "Thank you for that. You might not realize but your presence makes a life difference to her. Even if she move away for college or work, please invite her home for thanksgiving and Xmas each year. It will make her so happy", "Botty, botty, bot, bot. Comment stolen from Anonymouschick819.", "You really want to oversimplify and misinterpret everybody who says parents should consider their children's feelings, huh? \n\nYou are Viv in this situation. You are failing to realize that Sera was dragged into this against her will, and it damaged their relationship. It's just a natural consequence of not listening to your children.", "I don\u2019t think this is the solution lol. But she should\u2019ve validated her daughter\u2019s feelings and eased her up in expanding the family. Maybe not marry right away but acclimate her to the new change", "What is wrong with you??", "The 9 year old did NOT decide it. The 9 year old expressed discomfort with changing the home dynamic again after a major loss and suffering grief. She put her feelings forward and it was on her mother to put those feelings into consideration, which she failed to do and caused damage to her relationship with her daughter. Consideration for her daughters feelings should have been made and further discussions had because the daughter was forced to follow any decision the mother made. \n\n\"I'm the adult. I make the decisions and you have to deal with them\" is not a very good way to go when trying to create a loving and healthy relationship with your children.", "Literally NO ONE ever says that a child gets to decide whether their parent moves on after their spouses death / divorce ffs. Ohhhhh noooo a child doesn\u2019t like their (often shitty) new step-family, what a monster they are!!! /s\n\nOP\u2019s sister moved on and remarried quickly. 2 years is really not a long time, and she handled the situation poorly to say the least. She essentially told her child \u201csucks to suck your dad died but this is your new family accept it or fuck off\u201d. No one has said or suggested a parent can\u2019t move on after a divorce / death, but doing so quickly and not giving a shit about how your child feels about it isn\u2019t respectable. She\u2019s proven to be a bad parent that emotionally neglected her daughter in favor of her new husband and step-daughter and does not give a fuck how her actions have affected her daughter. She\u2019s allowed to remarry, again *literally no one* ever says otherwise, but acting like her daughter being upset about it only a year after she lost her father is ridiculous. Her entire life has been unstable and lonely since her father died thanks to the way her mother chose to behave all these years.", "I agree that a child doesn't get to decide a parent's relationships. But likewise the parent doesn't get to dictate a child's relationships. That's just not a thing you can force on other people -- and children are people. So if the parent wants a healthy blended family, they will respect that no child gets over their grief in a measly **one year**, and slow their roll. What's the damn hurry? The parent can still have a relationship without moving everybody in together and compounding their child's trauma. \n\nGood grief, I lost my mom at 45 and I'm 50+ now and still not over it. My mom lost her mom at 9 and it changed (in many ways ruined) her whole life. She **never** got over it, in part because the adults around her were absolutely cruel and impatient with her grief during a formative time in her personality. Kids are not small adults; their feelings are bigger and they don't know how to process them yet. The things that cause us short-term pain can be mortal wounds to them. A good parent will care about that, and take the time necessary to help the child through it before forcing them into a new traumatic situation.", "No, a nine year old doesn't get to decide.  But a parent does not have the right to demand the nine year old be happy when the parent chooses something that the nine year old clearly expressed that they didn't want.\n\nSera was, clearly, a bright and articulate nine-year-old.  Who could and did express what she was feeling in plain words anyone could understand.\n\nThen there is this:\n\n>She told me she can see now that Mia is more important to her and that unless she loves Mia and adopts her as a real sister she'll never have her mom back. She also told me she wishes she had never said anything to Viv and how much it makes her wish her dad was still around. \n\nViv has taught Sera that the only chance she has for a peaceful home is to lie and suppress her feelings. \n\nShe has taught Sera that the one surviving person in the world most responsible for Sera's welfare and mental health is untrustworthy, and must be placated with lies telling her what she wants to hear.\n\nViv has not only destroyed her relationship with Sera, she's also taught Sera that she cannot expect respect from the people in her life.", "The kids need time to mourn their lost parent.  Often more time than the surviving parent.\n\nHow many posts do we get here, where the divorced/surviving parent remarried, and the child is punished or pressured when they don't accept the stepparent as a parent or the stepsiblings as siblings?\n\nThe parent does have a legal right to remarry. But the fact that something is legal does not mean that it isn't still being an AH to someone. \n\nParents who remarry when their child clearly expresses that they are not done mourning, and do not feel ready for a step-family, do not get to claim they are acting in the best interests of their child(ren). \n\nThe parent does not have the right to dictate their child's feelings about their lost parent.  The parent does not have the right to demand that their child stop mourning their lost parent.  The parent does not have the right to insist that the child want and need and accept the step-family as their new family.\n\nSo, what you're left with is expecting basic decency and good manners to one or more unwanted housemates.  Politeness and good manners, with gentle instruction on acceptable ***behavior***, with no expectation of a particular set of ***feelings***. \n\nViv needs to stop pretending that the remarriage and blended family were for Sera's good and happiness.  Remarrying was in Viv's interest, not Sera's.  The price of Viv's happiness was Sera's unhappiness. \n\nViv needs to recognize that she sacrificed Sera's need to mourn at the alter of her own desire to remarry. Sera does not have to feel happy or grateful that Viv chose a situation that she ***knew*** would make Sera unhappy.\n\nAnd Sera has the right to tell Viv \"don't pretend that you did this for my sake, you did what you wanted, and I have no choice but to survive the situation until I can move out of it.\"\n\nViv also needs to recognize that the price she pays for the happiness of remarrying is living with an angry, sad teenager who is still mourning her father, and that Sera's reaction is appropriate for the situation, and not something Sera should be punished for.  Choose your happiness over your child's needs, if you must, but don't pretend it is anything but being selfish towards your child.", "If Viv doesn\u2019t do any of those things already, then that is a fair ask. If she does do those things, and her daughter doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s enough, then therapy is necessary for them both. In fact, therapy is probably necessary either way.", "She told her mom how she felt and her mom didn't listen, and now she's paying for it by her daughter pushing her away.", "Based on your account she doesn\u2019t have a speck of emotional intelligence and empathy.", "10/10", "NTA  That's where a blended family needs to start. And it's the most that a parent can expect from their child. Anything beyond that is a lucky bonus.", "Exactly! Staying single forever isn\u2019t the solution but to not consider your child\u2019s feelings, especially in the eye of a fresh trauma, then to spend the next decade using their vulnerability against them is toxic, disgusting and narcissistic", "Found the sister", "Exactly sorry you got one shot at marriage you don\u2019t deserve another one", "Sure you can, you just have to pour gasoline on it and it seems like mommy dearest is doing exactly that.", "Not only did she not listen, she called her 9 YEAR OLD selfish???? For not wanting to lose her mom after she\u2019s already lost her dad????? And it turns out that it was a completely valid fear because it\u2019s exactly what happened. Poor Sera. I\u2019m glad she at least has OP and her husband and MIL, someone who actually gives a shit about her.", "Bot", "Downvote and report. /u/Embarra5ss seems to be a rewording bot and stole this comment from /u/No_Tiger75", "Uhhh no lol. They're absolutely right. Saying someone never deserves to have a partner again is legitimately crazy. Obviously don't rush into things, but you are seriously delusional for saying the rest of their lives.", "That's not what I said.", "NTA. Due to her lack of interpersonal skills she is unable to see the situation clearly and fix it.", "Nah it\u2019s the same we both agree with each other", "Nope. Mine is saying that children have the right to make requests of their parents regarding their own needs, and parents should take those into consideration. Parents are free not to take those things into consideration, but they should be prepared to face social consequences with their children as a result. Unfortunately, Viv decided not to take Seras feelings into account and as a result, Sera feels largely abandoned and disregarded by her mother. This is a natural social consequence as a result of the complexities of human interaction.\n\nYours is.... not. What are you even trying to argue?"]}
