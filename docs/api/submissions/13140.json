However, there comes a point in the grieving process when they don't get to veto marriage/moving in just on general principle.

OP doesn't mention whether Mia's mother died, her parents divorced, or some other problem separated Mia's parents.", "Michael should jump ship. She might hold a grudge against Mia if she does something to piss her off.", "I think Viv's shell shock damaged her ability to connect emotionally and so she jumped into another marriage only a year later to keep from dealing with her pain, and therefore lacked the capacity to deal with anyone else's, including her own daughter. Only she has found herself in a non-marriage, perhaps by her own doing, maybe not (don't know too much about Michael other than OP's statement that he's equally unavailable to everyone). But part of me suspects his lack of involvement might be tied to Viv's venom. In assuming his perspective:  Sera doesn't accept him since Viv never cared enough to help her settle up with the idea,  so connecting is awkward at best; Viv's emotionally unavailable, and his little girl is quite taken by a woman doting on her. \n\n Viv lost the ability to connect to her daughter, perhaps because she still can't process her loss, and her daughter basically, for Viv, serves as a conduit to that pain. So the only thing Viv can do is focus on the one piece of distraction she has left,  Mia, which isn't fair to Mia, who since the age of 8, has had to basically be Viv's emotional support pet, which should never be a child's role or responsibility. Mia represents the new beginning Viv thought Michael would be for her and isn't tied to any grievance, so Viv is happy in this little world while blaming everyone else around her for those failing relationships.  And it's that perceived closeness that alienates Sera even more. Sounds like one bad hastily and emotionally made decision has caused nothing but 7 years of dysfunction, pain, and fractures. OP is doing all she can from the outside to bring Viv some much needed perspective and be supportive of her niece. That's no way an AH lol.  But this can't come from OP. Viv desperately needs the guidance of a very skilled therapist to bring her to these self revelations. Viv's upset (threatened?) by OP and Sera's closeness, but Sera's getting older and will continue to make her own choices.
