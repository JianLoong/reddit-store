I'll call her Sera for the post. So when Sera was 7 her dad passed away. Her dad walked out the door to work that morning and got into an accident which cost him and two others their lives. Viv was shell shocked. She and Sera's dad were high school sweethearts who had Sera the year after they finished college. Sera and her dad were as close as could be and his loss rocked her. About a year later Viv met her current husband Michael. A year after they started dating they introduced Sera and Michael's daughter Mia to each other. Sera was 9 at the time and asked her mom not to keep dating Michael and not to be Mia's stepmom. She told Viv she wanted her to herself and didn't want to be second choice to her. Viv, instead of showing concern that Sera would feel that way, or even ask some questions about where that was coming from, called her selfish and told her she was a child who had no idea how the world worked and would not get to be selfish by denying another kid a mom. She also told her Michael was looking forward to being her stepdad and that she'd be better off having another dad and a sister for the first time.\n\nI remember at the time telling Viv that she had felt the very same way when our dad married our stepmom. And we didn't even lose our mom to death, she just left our lives. Viv was especially angry that our stepmom had two kids of her own and didn't want anything to do with them. She said she was a selfish little bitch back then too and realizes now they were the best thing to happen to us.\n\nSera is 16 now and she's in high school. Mia is 15 and also in high school. The girls are not close. I think both still see themselves as only children and they're not claiming each other from what I know. Viv has held onto what Sera said as a 9 year old girl who lost her dad and was scared to lose her mom, and because she and Mia aren't close, she brings it up to her constantly and accuses her of trying to get her way by not embracing Mia. Michael, I have come to realize, just wanted someone to raise his daughter, and is not really involved all that deeply in anything related to his marriage to Viv or being a parent to either girl, even Mia.\n\nSera told me, my husband and my MIL (who acts as another grandma to her) that she feels like her mom hates her and that she wishes she could move out. She told me she can see now that Mia is more important to her and that unless she loves Mia and adopts her as a real sister she'll never have her mom back. She also told me she wishes she had never said anything to Viv and how much it makes her wish her dad was still around. Viv didn't like how much time Sera was spending with us, confronted me and I told her she would lose her daughter if she doesn't get over this grudge and accept that her child just wanted to experience less change after such a big loss. Viv said I was ruining her family. She also called me a bitch.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679740625, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/121hxdw/aita_for_telling_my_sister_shes_going_to_lose_her/", "score": 789, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I begged my mother not to marry George as I was already terrified of being abandoned, and was met with being told what a brat I was for wanting to keep my mom to myself, and wanting to \u201cdeprive\u201d Gina of a mother. I spent my entire childhood having this one conversation of a terrified newly abandoned child rubbed in my face and facing the constant backlash and hostility that came with it.

At 16 Sera has every right to be taken seriously as the almost adult she is, and that includes taking her feelings seriously. Clearly your sister is not doing this. Thankfully you are.

Stick to your guns, your niece deserves it!", "NTA sounds like everyone needed counseling but did not get any. Viv is a hateful person, and her daughter knows it.", "Unless they all agree to some serious family therapy, this sadly sounds like no healing will take place.

Anything beyond that is a lucky bonus.\n\nFor all the talk that parents have when divorcing or remarrying after a divorce or death of a spouse about \"the best interests of the child,\" the decisions that are made are always the parents deciding what they think is best for themselves, and the kids have to go along with it.  \n\nSera spoke clearly that she did not want her living situation to change, did not want a second adult in the household, did not want a step-sibling.  All of this was ignored.  \n\nSera's mother got what she wanted.  A new spouse.  Sera got exactly what she said she didn't want, a step-parent and step-sibling.\n\nWhere is Mia's mother in all this?  OP doesn't mention whether Mia's mother died, her parents divorced, or some other problem separated Mia's parents.\n\nAnd how does Mia feel about having a stepsister and stepmother?

I believe kids should have veto rights, while they're minors and powerless to get away, if their parent's prospective partner is a specific person they really can't live with.  However, there comes a point in the grieving process when they don't get to veto marriage/moving in just on general principle.  If they were young when their parent was widowed, it's too much to ask for alot of people to remain unpartnered for possibly over a decade.\n\nWhat makes you NTA is that your sister couldn't have handled this worse, in more ways than I can list.  She didn't approach it with \"I know you miss Daddy, I do too.  I love you, but it's in a different way than with an adult partner, and I need that too.

Sera is now 16 and she can petition the courts to either be emancipated or ask the court to make you her guardian. I know this isn't a decision to rush into. Something for you, your husband and even your mother in law think about. But Sera is at an age where her home life can have such a negative impact on her future. School, future plans (more schooling), careers, depression, friendships, bonding with other adults...all this can be affected with how she feels now and obviously the past several years. Your sister is not going to take her head out of her a$$ for this child, someone needs to help Sera and now!", "NTA. Looks like we\u2019ve got a missing reasons parent. So glad your niece has you and others as a support system.", "NTA. Please don't feel like YTA. You're being such a loving aunt to Sera and I'm sure your attention means more to her than you know.", "Where is Mia's mother in all this? OP doesn't mention whether Mia's mother died, her parents divorced, or some other problem separated Mia's parents.", "Michael should jump ship. She might hold a grudge against Mia if she does something to piss her off.", "I think Viv's shell shock damaged her ability to connect emotionally and so she jumped into another marriage only a year later to keep from dealing with her pain, and therefore lacked the capacity to deal with anyone else's, including her own daughter. Only she has found herself in a non-marriage, perhaps by her own doing, maybe not (don't know too much about Michael other than OP's statement that he's equally unavailable to everyone). But part of me suspects his lack of involvement might be tied to Viv's venom. In assuming his perspective:  Sera doesn't accept him since Viv never cared enough to help her settle up with the idea,  so connecting is awkward at best; Viv's emotionally unavailable, and his little girl is quite taken by a woman doting on her. \n\n Viv lost the ability to connect to her daughter, perhaps because she still can't process her loss, and her daughter basically, for Viv, serves as a conduit to that pain. So the only thing Viv can do is focus on the one piece of distraction she has left,  Mia, which isn't fair to Mia, who since the age of 8, has had to basically be Viv's emotional support pet, which should never be a child's role or responsibility. Mia represents the new beginning Viv thought Michael would be for her and isn't tied to any grievance, so Viv is happy in this little world while blaming everyone else around her for those failing relationships.  And it's that perceived closeness that alienates Sera even more. Sounds like one bad hastily and emotionally made decision has caused nothing but 7 years of dysfunction, pain, and fractures. OP is doing all she can from the outside to bring Viv some much needed perspective and be supportive of her niece. That's no way an AH lol.  But this can't come from OP. Viv desperately needs the guidance of a very skilled therapist to bring her to these self revelations. Viv's upset (threatened?) by OP and Sera's closeness, but Sera's getting older and will continue to make her own choices.  I hope OP ignores her sister's displaced projected anger and continues to be a place of safety, love, and acceptance for Serenity.", "She is horrible for the way she talk to and about her daughter.", "Listen, Viv had a *horrible* reaction to Sera but this: \n\n>Sera spoke clearly that she did not want her living situation to change, did not want a second adult in the household, did not want a step-sibling.  All of this was ignored.\n\nA nine year old doesn't get to decide this. Viv should have discussed Sera's feelings with her, comforted her, gave her assurance she wasn't losing her, etc, but Viv should not have decided not to remarry just because Sera expressed she didn't want a stepdad or a step-sibling. She should have gotten Sera therapy and the entire family should have gone to family therapy after Viv got remarried. They obviously needed it.", "I don't get this attitude that widowed parents aren't allowed to move on and have a new partner, just because the kids want to keep things as a single parent family.\n\nthere's some serious fucked up thinking in that.\n\nchildren don't have the right to insist their parent remain single.", "She is not Mia's aunt. She don't need two beds and I, as an aunt, in such a situation would never take away the peace that my niece feels in my house by demonstrating that I can receive her step sister in my house and destroying the only safe place she has.  OP is not Mia's aunt and does not need to include her. The only thing this action would do is push Serenity away from her aunt by giving Mia her space.", "Exactly. Everybody involved needed therapy. The result of them not getting therapy is this dysfunctional family.", "What the hell has Sera done wrong?", "NTA and please don't leave this girl alone, not after her own mother abandoned her when she was a child who needed support. \nIs she on therapy?

It will be hard for you to ruin it.", "Good! Nta. Your sister sucks", "I'm glad you're gonna take her in.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm going through what Sera is. I lost my mother in 2020, and my dad remarried a year ago. I didn't get to grieve, and my dad tried to force the relationship between me and his wife. It's not working out as he hoped, and he has damaged the relationship between him and I, as well as the relationship between him and my older sister. \n\nPlease get her to therapy when she's 18. It definitely seem like she needs it. And you are an amazing person for stepping up.", "Sounds like Michael doesn't much care either way. 'So long as someone is raising/has raised her, all's fine' is what it seems to be.", "Kids also need time to grieve before being forced into even more huge changes.  Viv could have kept seeing Michael and gotten Sera into grief counseling.  Instead she called her daughter terrible names for having normal feelings and married the first person to cross her path.", "Children absolutely have the right to request a stable living situation. Children absolutely have the right to express when they're unhappy with their parents' decisions. Parents ultimately get to make their decisions but must face the consequences of those decisions and need to keep the needs of their children at the forefront. Children are not subordinates but people who are already growing into their own needs.\n\n\nThe mother tried to force her daughter into an unstable and unwanted living situation and forced her into a dynamic she was not ready for yet. Then, she had the audacity to blame her daughter for having negative feelings related to that decision and is leveraging those negative feelings as shame and punishment.

Precisely. You can\u2019t ruin a flaming trash heap. \n\nIt\u2019s just so mean.
