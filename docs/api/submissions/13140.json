I'll call her Sera for the post. So when Sera was 7 her dad passed away. Her dad walked out the door to work that morning and got into an accident which cost him and two others their lives. Viv was shell shocked. She and Sera's dad were high school sweethearts who had Sera the year after they finished college. Sera and her dad were as close as could be and his loss rocked her. About a year later Viv met her current husband Michael. A year after they started dating they introduced Sera and Michael's daughter Mia to each other. Sera was 9 at the time and asked her mom not to keep dating Michael and not to be Mia's stepmom. She told Viv she wanted her to herself and didn't want to be second choice to her. Viv, instead of showing concern that Sera would feel that way, or even ask some questions about where that was coming from, called her selfish and told her she was a child who had no idea how the world worked and would not get to be selfish by denying another kid a mom. She also told her Michael was looking forward to being her stepdad and that she'd be better off having another dad and a sister for the first time.\n\nI remember at the time telling Viv that she had felt the very same way when our dad married our stepmom. And we didn't even lose our mom to death, she just left our lives. Viv was especially angry that our stepmom had two kids of her own and didn't want anything to do with them. She said she was a selfish little bitch back then too and realizes now they were the best thing to happen to us.\n\nSera is 16 now and she's in high school. Mia is 15 and also in high school. The girls are not close. I think both still see themselves as only children and they're not claiming each other from what I know. Viv has held onto what Sera said as a 9 year old girl who lost her dad and was scared to lose her mom, and because she and Mia aren't close, she brings it up to her constantly and accuses her of trying to get her way by not embracing Mia. Michael, I have come to realize, just wanted someone to raise his daughter, and is not really involved all that deeply in anything related to his marriage to Viv or being a parent to either girl, even Mia.\n\nSera told me, my husband and my MIL (who acts as another grandma to her) that she feels like her mom hates her and that she wishes she could move out. She told me she can see now that Mia is more important to her and that unless she loves Mia and adopts her as a real sister she'll never have her mom back. She also told me she wishes she had never said anything to Viv and how much it makes her wish her dad was still around. Viv didn't like how much time Sera was spending with us, confronted me and I told her she would lose her daughter if she doesn't get over this grudge and accept that her child just wanted to experience less change after such a big loss. Viv said I was ruining her family. She also called me a bitch.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679740625, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/121hxdw/aita_for_telling_my_sister_shes_going_to_lose_her/", "score": 156, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The reason I am questioning my role here is I don't know what it's like to lose a spouse and try to move on, and have your child not want that. Maybe I'm not being compassionate enough to both sides here. Maybe I am letting my sister's initial reaction color how I feel about things at present.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

In two years can your niece come live with you if she's not going away for college?", "NTA by a million miles!\n\nMy father was my hero, a stay at home dad, and my whole world until he walked out on us at 8, less than a year later my mom remarried a widower George, who had a daughter Gina. I begged my mother not to marry George as I was already terrified of being abandoned, and was met with being told what a brat I was for wanting to keep my mom to myself, and wanting to \u201cdeprive\u201d Gina of a mother. I spent my entire childhood having this one conversation of a terrified newly abandoned child rubbed in my face and facing the constant backlash and hostility that came with it. My only solace was my moms brother/my uncle and his girlfriend/wife who showed me what it meant to be loved unconditionally and honestly is probably the only reason I\u2019m still alive. 25 years later, the only relationship I have is with my uncle and aunt, I haven\u2019t seen my mother since two weeks before my wedding when I was 22 - and Gina, well she cleaned out their bank account and ran off with a boyfriend 6 years ago and then and only then did my mother finally decide she needed a relationship with me\n\nYour sister is a manipulative hateful person and your niece needs all the love she can get, keep being her advocate, her confidante and listening ear. Because she will be become an adult and will no longer want anything to do with her mother, and your relationship will mean the world to her.", "NTA, your niece feels loved and safe with you, something she doesn't get at home. She told her mom how she felt and her mom didn't listen, and now she's paying for it by her daughter pushing her away. You've embraced her,  cared for her, and showed her love something her mom should have done after they lost such a huge piece of their lives and beyond instead of forcing all of these changes on her.", "NTA.  I am glad you are standing up for your niece.  What your sister is doing is exactly what you said, she is slowly pushing her daughter away.  The fact that she is 16 means that within 2 years she might want nothing to do with her mom unless your sister does something to fix their relationship.   It\u2019s sad to lose your dad and your mom as well", "NTA. Viv is the selfish one. Based on your account she doesn\u2019t have a speck of emotional intelligence and empathy. Truly embarrassing for a grown woman to be so emotionally stunted. \n\nUnfortunately, due to her lack of interpersonal skills she is unable to see the situation clearly and fix it (even if she wanted to).", "NTA. It sounds like Viv is the selfish one!", "NTA. Be there when she turns 18, because it\u2019s almost a given that she will be ditching her mom the first chance she can do so legally.", "NTA, you're looking out for your niece who seems like she desperately just needs someone to hear her. What your sister chooses to do or not do is entirely her call, but if her kid ends up moving out as a result, she can't say she wasn't warned.", "NTA in my book. You told her upfront she\u2019s ruining her relationship with her daughter and honestly? I think deep down she knows it too. She knows shes in the wrong and is lashing out to live in the comforting lie that shes correct because confronting the reality is too painful. I\u2019m at least glad Sera has you in her life, but I\u2019m sad in this process she\u2019s lost her mother in a way as well. I hope for nothing but the best for her.\n\nMay her father\u2019s memory be a blessing \u2764\ufe0f.", "NTA.\n\nViv, it seems, wants to blame everyone for her unhappiness except herself. She's lashing out because she knows you're right.", "Sounds like Viv needs to accept the fact that the 2 girls are not ever going to be close. I think something would have happened by now. Honestly, NTA. This will not go well for her when Sera gets older and she keeps pushing this - it will driver her away, and the shocked pikachu face will come out, not having seen this coming, even though you told her about it.", "NTA and oh my heart aches for your niece.", "NTA.   \nBecause an aunt is a safe place to vent your family problems, and retreat to when you need to.  \nYWBTA if you keep raising this with your sister though. You\u2019ve shared what is going on, and now you have to step back and leave it be.   \nPersonally I\u2019d set up a spare room with two beds in it if I had space\u2026 one for each girl, and say \u201cAlways happy to have moody teens at my place when everyone needs a break from each other!\u201d And then just let Sera quietly spend more time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

At 16 Sera has every right to be taken seriously as the almost adult she is, and that includes taking her feelings seriously. Clearly your sister is not doing this. Thankfully you are. It's very important for people her age to have a close adult in there corner and acknowledging that they have a right to think and feel as an independent human being. Stick to your guns, your niece deserves it!", "NTA sounds like everyone needed counseling but did not get any. Viv is a hateful person, and her daughter knows it.", "Unless they all agree to some serious family therapy, this sadly sounds like no healing will take place. I hope Sera has a professional to talk to about this at some point.

All you can really do is be there for your niece and support her", "NTA. You told it like it is.\nViv ruined her family from the beginning by not considering Sera\u2019s feelings.", "NTA\n\nPolite housemates.  That's where a blended family needs to start.  And it's the most that a parent can expect from their child.  Anything beyond that is a lucky bonus.\n\nFor all the talk that parents have when divorcing or remarrying after a divorce or death of a spouse about \"the best interests of the child,\" the decisions that are made are always the parents deciding what they think is best for themselves, and the kids have to go along with it.  \n\nSera spoke clearly that she did not want her living situation to change, did not want a second adult in the household, did not want a step-sibling.  All of this was ignored.  \n\nSera's mother got what she wanted.  A new spouse.  Sera got exactly what she said she didn't want, a step-parent and step-sibling.\n\nWhere is Mia's mother in all this?  OP doesn't mention whether Mia's mother died, her parents divorced, or some other problem separated Mia's parents.\n\nAnd how does Mia feel about having a stepsister and stepmother?  Two children had to adapt to a situation not of their choosing, not just Sera.  Even if Sera decided to try to accept Mia as a sister, it's not going to work unless Mia feels the same.", "Yes, there will always be a place for her with us.
