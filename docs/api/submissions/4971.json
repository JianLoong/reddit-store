She probably also wanted to piss the new girlfriend off. What are the odds that he really thought she had lost it?", "But it's pretty!\n\nYTA.", "Ngl - she had me in the first half and the second the words \u201c family diamonds\u201d registered in my brain I went *WTF did I just read?!* and had to do a double take. Then when I got to the selling it back part I was dumbfounded by what I had read \n\nThe whole deterrent thing is hit or miss in my experience. If OP actually believes it works then it\u2019s out of needing to believe there\u2019s a legitimate reason to have kept it and stopping before the solution of buying another cheap one to wear. \n\nImo this whole situation was intended and planned when she found out he would be there with his SO and family.", "Same. If it's something that was just bought for you then yeah, you have every right to keep it, it was a gift.\n\nBut if it's a family heirloom then, even though you technically don't have to give it back, it's a really shitty thing to do, as it probably means a lot to the family.\n\nHowever, based on OP's responses, she wasn't asked to give it back until now, so idk.", "I agree, it\u2019s sort of like a hiring bonus. You don\u2019t get to keep it if you quit right after it hits your bank account.", "Haha I just commented that above \ud83d\ude05 if it wasn't for Judge Judy I wouldn't know the limited legal stuff I do now.", "I suspect that it really WAS the ex's engagement party, and OP wants to soften her behavior. Why else would the ex's whole family be there?", "Also, why is she trying to repel suitors at an engagement party? How many people are afraid of getting hit on by strangers at an engagement party? Using her reasoning for why she wears the ring, there's no reason for her to be wearing it at this party except to cause drama.", "I mean\u2026 mutual friend? My wife and I went to high school together, along with most of her youth group and a few of her cousins. I\u2019d expect to run into some of her family members at an engagement party for any of those people.\n\nOf course, the fact that OP should easily have foreseen running into her ex\u2019s family does show that she was probably wearing the ring on purpose.", "The answer, legally, is... it depends on where you live. \n\nHere in the US, the laws vary by State. In some States, engagement rings are considered absolute gifts, meaning that once you give it, that's it. In some (most actually) States it's considered a conditional gift, with the condition, obviously, being marriage. Once the marriage happens, then the condition is fulfilled. \n\nIn the \"Conditional Gift\" States, it can also matter who ends the engagement. There are States that take a no-fault approach, meaning it doesn't matter who ends the engagement, and a few that still have a fault-based approach, where it does matter who called things off.", "Not sure why so many people are posting this incorrect statement", "Because she's awful", "It\u2019s because of Reed vs St Romain in Louisiana where a ring given as a Christmas present was determined to not be an engagement ring. It\u2019s pretty fact specific though. He didn\u2019t propose but she did wear it on her ring finger.", "Those guidelines generally go out the window when the ring is a family heirloom, or in this case, made with family heirloom diamonds.\n\nEven if the man was an AH and they broke up because of his infidelity or abuse or whatever, the nice thing to do would be to give the ring back, even if you do it by returning it to the ex's parents or sibling (like in this case where it's clear OP knows his parents and sister, she could have returned it to them, or just posted it to their address, if she didn't want to have to physically hand it back to her ex for whatever reason).\n\nKeeping a family heirloom from someone else's family, when you no longer have any connection to that family, because you think it's \"pretty\" is generally an AH move.", "> I believe the etiquette is based on who left who\n\nI think the etiquette is actually just to give back the ring no matter what the circumstances of the breakup are.", "I\u2019m pretty sure, but happy to be corrected that legally the ring is to be returned as it symbolises a promise that was no fulfilled or the legal speak for that, not to mention the fact that it was made with his family stones. So etiquette aside, I don\u2019t think she has as much choice in the matter as she believes. \n\nIt also feels like a bit of a power play, especially wearing it to an event that she knew him and his family and current girlfriend were attending.", "I often wonder when I see these kind of aita just what these people were expecting.  Like did she expect everyone to be cool with her waring THIS ring when everyone knew which one it was?", "I have a distinct feeling that she *hasn't* moved on considering the circumstances. She's acting like a textbook crazy ex.\n\nYTA, OP. Engagement rings are conditional gifts, and you failed that condition. Give the man his ring back.\n\nPoor guy clearly dodged a bullet. I wonder who called the engagement off.", "I was looking for an NTA so I could disagree but you made some very good points", "There aren't many other interpretations. \n\nMad at: Ex\n\nFU to new girlfirend\n\nTruly batshit crazy\n\nTakeaway: Don't go to any parties with them anymore because she's outed herself as an AH.", "Yeah this is my thought process. If she knew that the family thought it was lost and wore it anyway it seems obvious that she was trying to make a statement, and a petty one at that.", "This. Before I even read about her going to the engagement party, as soon as I read that she uses it to not get picked up on I thought \"why wouldn't you just get another cheap one...?\" It's not like that's the *only* pretty ring out there. You literally can even get a plastic one that will be convincing in places like clubs or bars. OP did this on purpose", "Right?? Odds are strong no one who knows her ex would be hitting on her!!\n\nAbout 20 years ago, I bought a fake solitaire. set in real gold, that I wore when I was out with girlfriends and didn\u2019t want to be approached. In later years, I was so happy to have it because I would wear it when my husband and I were traveling and I didn\u2019t want to risk losing my real ring. I think it\u2019s never a bad idea but keeping someone\u2019s family diamonds is just mean. Even if my fianc\u00e9 had cheated on me, I would give back the ring if it included family stones.", "In some countries, it is legally considered a \"gift\" if the other person called off the wedding. If she called it off, then he is entitled to it back.", "This!!!\n\nClearly OP isn\u2019t over her ex and secretly but not-so-subtly hopes that ex would take her back. LoL.  She also wants to rub it in the new gf out of spite. \n\nOP.....YTA!  be a decent human being and just give the dang ring back. It\u2019s a family heirloom and you are a huge A for holding that ring hostage!\n\nGrow up, move on and grow a heart!", "Yeah, and she could just be polite and turn down someone asking her out if she\u2019s not interested. She doesn\u2019t have to play pretend at a private party where I bet it caused some confusion.", "Legally speaking it\u2019s a conditional gift, a gift in contemplation of marriage. Another example of a conditional gift would be giving a younger family member X sum of money if they satisfy a condition like graduating from college. The donee\u2019s interest in the property does not vest unless the condition is satisfied. If the condition is not satisfied\u2014like the marriage not occurring\u2014the conditional gift remains the property of the donor. It\u2019s not just gone forever.\n\nThe holiday argument is also not true. You would have to establish that he got down on one knee, said \u201cwill you marry me,\u201d and gave the ring as purely a holiday gift unrelated to marriage. Just because your proposal falls on a holiday does NOT mean the ring is legally swept away. The holiday argument is extremely weak because we all know what proposals and rings are for.", "I think he's only asking for it back, because his family and girlfriend are angry.", "Yea I mean really they could come to a compromise and go to a jeweler to remove the family diamonds and set the ring with whatever she wants since the issue seems to be the diamonds are the family heirloom.", "The weight will come off eventually don\u2019t worry about it for now", "I was hit-on by the DJ I was going to hire for my reception.  Besides having a noticeable engagement ring, telling him it was for my WEDDING reception, AND NOT flirting... he fucking called me a week later and asked me to meet him at a bar!   I think rings act as catnip to some guys.  When I lived in Italy a wedding ring was simply viewed as a Challenge!    \n\n\nNote:  the DJ was about 10 years younger than my dad... ew."]}
