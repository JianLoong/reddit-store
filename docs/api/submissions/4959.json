Four years old is old enough to understand this and since your wife doesn't seem to get it, you need to educate your daughter.

I have a 4 year old who knows full well not to touch medicines that haven't been given to her. She understands that taking medicines that aren't for her could make her very sick.\n\nPersonally I think OP should have made every effort to make sure they're on the same page on this before passive aggressively putting the meds in the bathroom, because unless his wife is the one who puts them away, she'll just take them out again this evening and it'll become a pissing match between the two of them.", "I've said this in response to another comment, but I'll repeat it again here.

I now just agree with her that she is a bad mother because she's centering herself in an issue I'm having and refuses to discuss real problems. \n\nIt's a manipulation tactic. Just as you've stated, it prevents you from talking about the issue, and it centers their feelings. Now, it's no longer about the problem, you're instead having to coddle them. So, stop coddling. You don't have to immediately jump to \"yeah, you're right, you do suck\", that's just how far it's progressed with my mother. First, try to let then cry and calmly say \"I will wait for you to calm down then we will resume this conversation.\" People *do* get emotional during confrontation, the difference is how they handle it. Someone who is not manipulative will later address with issue; something OP's wife is refusing to do\n\nEditing to add: teach daughter pill safety. You can buy \"Mr. Yuck\" stickers online; put them on the pill bottles and teach her that when something has that on it, it's medicine and not candy and not to eat it. She's likely had to take medicine before, right? Compare it to that as it's something she knows. \"Remember when you were sick and we gave you cough medicine? Well mommy takes medicine that looks like this *show her*. If you have this when you're not sick, it'll make you sick. This sticker means it's medicine, so don't eat it because we don't want you to get sick. If you find candy on the floor, bring it to me before you or *cat's name* eats it, so I can check to make sure it's really candy, and I'll give you *actual candy she likes* instead.\" It explains it in a child friendly way and it's something that you should do even if there's an issue with pills not being properly kept. Kids get into everything, teaching them what's dangerous is a good harm reduction strategy\n\nEdit 2: OP has said in a comment that their wife screams at them and name calls when they disagree. That's emotional abuse. It is *never* okay to degrade, name call, yell at, berate, or huniliate your partner. Becoming passive in disagreements and day to day life is the goal of this abuse. If every time you bring up an issue, it's like you have to disassembled a bomb, you stop bringing up arguments. OP, go to LoveIsRespect.org. they have resources you can find helpful and a live chat you can use to discuss your situation and a possible exit plan with someone whose trained in these things.

Maybe that would be pretty enough for your wife to feel using it is worth the effort. Use an attractive wooden gun safe. Anything. There are even lockboxes that open by fingerprint so opening them is really simple and quick even if you're depressed and making an effort to do things is beyond you. \n\nIdeally, you could try to find a lockbox small enough to fit wherever the medications are currently, so your wife doesn't have to get up and go anywhere she didn't have to go before.\n\nI hope you get this fixed because your child is in danger.", "Honestly with mine, agreeing with her is even less helpful. Because she fully spirals into self-pity and pouting and the conversation constantly twists back to how everyone just hates her anyway blahblahblah. Staying calm and calling out that she\u2019s making it about judgment, not me, and that no one said she was bad, but that we have to address an issue, ALSO doesn\u2019t work because she just keeps spinning and shifting the topic away or, like OP\u2019s wife, insisting she\u2019ll take care of it. And then never does.\n\nIf someone is dysfunctional enough, there\u2019s honestly NOTHING you can do to get them to snap out of it.

This might be a \"we didn't wear seatbelts and turned out just fine-- what do you mean loads of people didn't?\" situation, but at four, I would say your daughter is almost old enough that this shouldn't be an issue if she's taught correctly?

All it would take is a moment of inattention for your daughter to decide she wants some \"candy\", and then... no more daughter.  \n\nBut, as someone who takes a lot of pills herself, I wonder if the problem is that if they're out of sight, she'll forget to take them. I have a real problem with this. I recommend checking with your local pharmacies to see if any of them offer a sachet service. It's been literally life-changing for me. Like, I tell them which pills I take every morning and they put them all in a little plastic sachet for me, so I just pop open the sachet and it's all done. No messing with a thousand different boxes and jars, no risk of kids or pets getting into them.  \n\nAlternately, you may want to consider getting her a pill organiser that has an alarm/chime, see if that helps. Those are handy because you just fill them once a week and then when it's time for your pill... BING!  A nice little reminder, so you don't forget even if it's out of sight.  \n\nOf course, the other solution that comes to mind is a simple lockbox.  You know, one of the light-weight cash boxes you take to markets or something?  They're like ten bucks and have a little key she could wear around her neck, so she can keep the pills with her without risking the kiddo getting into them.
