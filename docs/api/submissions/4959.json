Compounded with the fact that every morning and night she takes all of these pills in front of our daughter, and the little one is really into imitating us and doing the same things we do, and I\u2019m really uncomfortable with all these drugs being stored the way they are.  Childproof bottles or not.  \n\nI\u2019ve asked her before to move them to the upper shelf in the bathroom linen closet and she said she would, but hasn\u2019t done it.  It had been several weeks, and last night I calmly told her that either she needed to move her meds that night or that I would do it for her.  Didn\u2019t yell or call her names, didn\u2019t swear or anything confrontational.\n\nHer response was a bunch of gibberish about how I shouldn\u2019t be calling her a bad mom and that the pills are fine where they are because our daughter has never tried to play with them before.  I repeated my offer to move them for her if she didn\u2019t want to do it and she said she would do it, then didn\u2019t talk to me the rest of the night.\n\nWell this morning I go upstairs to get my daughter dressed and see the goddamn pills still in the bedroom.

By switching their place, her whole routine may be disrupted, which can be very destabilizing and upsetting for some people.

Your girlfriend seems to have her head in the sand on this one and needs a wake up call, so maybe move to shock tactics.\n\nI had a safety problem with my partner not tightening the straps properly when putting our little girl into the car seat or putting her in wearing a bulky coat. I spoke to him multiple times and he agreed it was a risk even for short journeys and said he would change but never did, and it got to the point where I was in tears begging him to do some research on car seat safety- it didn\u2019t work.\n\nIn the end I found links to new stories where the outcome wasn\u2019t great to highlight why I was so concerned - it worked!\n\nMaybe a similar tactic would work for you OP?", "Soft YTA. Like someone said earlier, just moving the tray of pills isn't going to solve the problem, most especially if you are finding them all over the house anyway. I would suggest that you have a talk with your daughter, in age appropriate terms, about the medications Mommy takes, why she takes them, how they help Mommy, but would hurt her if she swallowed them. Liken it to the last time she got hurt, and tell her you don't want her to get hurt. You aren't protecting your daughter by not talking to her about the elephant in the room. Four years old is old enough to understand this and since your wife doesn't seem to get it, you need to educate your daughter. Also, talk to your wife's doctor, if you can, or go with your wife to her next doctor's appointment, and let him/her know how your wife is handling the meds around your 4 year old. Maybe the doctor can get through to your wife.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

So one thing you need to totally understand is that BOTH OF YOU have been keeping deadly drugs where your 4-year-old can easily reach them, for WEEKS. Not your wife, BOTH OF YOU.  Why have you let this continue for more than a day???

She is being an awful mother who is risking your child's life. A child can overdose on even Aleve, aspirin, and mild pain relievers. This would be a hill I die on. No sugar-coating or anything. You need to show your wife this post and let her read the comments so she can maybe get some perceptive on how she is being a crap parent. I would secretly start documenting the negligence and risk she is taking with your daughter so you have evidence should you need it. But I am also going to say this to you specifically OP. You are BAD father yourself and you want to know why? YOU are not taking this issue serious enough and are allowing your wife to put your baby at risk every time this happens and with every pill fallen to the ground. I hope you don't ever have to experience your baby needing their stomach pumped, getting brain damage forever, or dying because that is what is at stake here. Man up and deal with the problem head on. Even if that means leaving your negligent wife and taking her to court for being irresponsible with your daughter. Step it up.

You know children have overdosed and died on aspirin or gotten brain damaged from overdosing. The OP's wife sucks.

I\u2019m guessing it\u2019ll be you\u2014after all, you\u2019ve been going out of your way to compensate by cleaning up loose pills for her. When your kid finds one it\u2019ll be because you missed it! Etc.\n\nDocument this shit before you clean the stray pills and open bottles, on a regular basis.
