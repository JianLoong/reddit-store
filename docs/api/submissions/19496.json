I appreciate the nice comments that were left on the last post very much and hope this one will be easier to follow and that the details will not be too triggering to anyone.\n\nAbout 1 week ago I (female23) was at a bachelorette party for my close friend. We met while in high school and have been friends for about 7 years. For her bachelorette party we travelled to a big city and surprised her with the trip. While we were there we went out partying several nights. On the third night I had three drinks and then blacked out and could not remember what had happened. When I was in better shape I was able to seek medical help, and they sadly confirmed my suspicions. My close friend and her other friends that were on the trip did not believe what happened to me and told me I had probably had too much to drink and that I was making a big deal out of nothing. \n\nThey continued partying the next night and tried to force me to come with them, but I refused and stayed in my hotel room. At this point I was very upset and also in physical pain. They continued the activities they had planned and had a good time partying until the next day when we were set to go home. Afterwards they told me I was selfish, and that I had ruined her bachelorette party for no reason. They called me slurs and told me they knew a lot of people who had similar experiences and handled it way better than me. I did not call them any slurs or say anything back other than telling them to leave me alone and get out of my room. Since returning from the trip I have not been in contact with any of them and they have not reached out to me. I am still struggling a lot with what happened and I am seeing a psychologist. \n\nI still have a lot of anger for the way they treated me and for leaving me alone at the club. Am I the a-hole for telling the bride I no longer want to attend her wedding despite having RSVPd yes? I am not in the bridal party, but the wedding is only a few weeks away so it\u2019s short notice, and me not attending might lead to questions on why. From her point of view she obviously does not understand the severity of the situation and feels that I treated them unfairly by rejecting their efforts to include me, and she also feels that I put blame on them when talking to my family about my experience.", "created_utc": 1686450257, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146i2cp/aita_for_not_going_to_my_friends_wedding_after/", "score": 36, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Never speak to these people again. Like the old adage goes, with friends like these, who needs enemies. \n\nIm so sorry and wish the you best in your recovery.", "NTA. I'm so sorry this happened to you. Not only should you not go to the wedding, you should cut contact. Anyone who blamea you or doesn't support you, or even abandoned you in the first place is not a friend", "NTA and these people are not your friends. If what I think happened did happen, they would have supported you instead of berating you. I\u2019m so sorry . Everything is temporary, you will find better friends.", "Clearly NTA.\n\nIf they don't care that you were assaulted, they aren't your friends.\n\nAnd people don't go to the weddings of people who they aren't friends with.\n\nYou deserve better. What happened to you was horrible.\n\nOf course it depends on how much you want to tell people but I'm sure if people heard the truth, they'd both understand why you're not in the wedding any more, and why you're no longer friends with the bride.", "NTA, and withdrawing your RSVP is the least of the things you should be worried about right now.\n\nThese people are not your friends. They do not deserve your attendance at the wedding, especially if you are required to behave as though nothing is wrong.\n\nI hope you are getting the support you need, and I wish you well.\n\nEDITED TO ADD: The more I read OP's post, the angrier I get at how her so-called \"friends\" behaved.\n\nThe bride will be damn lucky if OP even bothers to contact them to say she's withdrawing her RSVP. I'd be sorely tempted to just not show up.", "Thank you for all the supportive comments <3 I was unsure what I could include as the last post was taken down, but the doctors did find evidence of assault.

You were not unfair. They were and they abandoned you. You need better friends! \nTell her you are no longer attending, nothing further is necessary. No is a complete sentence. Blocking is a very efficient tool to keep out people from your life who have no compassion for you when you are in a situation that leaves you in physical pain and in a state of distress.", "NTA at all. They didn't give two craps about your trauma and went on partying. Which, by itself, let's say is fine, but they even had the nerve to dismiss it and call you out for nor joining them the following nights. I also suspect their conversations without you revolved a lot around victim blaming. So why should you care about her wedding at this point? You need new friends.", "Your drink was spiked and I assume some further awful things happened. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you went through that.\n\nSurely the facts are glaring for anyone outside: 1) they left you alone drunk and spiked 2) didn\u2019t care the next day 3) never accepted the situation and continued to badmouth you and gas light you. \n\nThey aren\u2019t your friends - the bride isn\u2019t your friend - what others ask why you weren\u2019t there - you can answer - if they want to continue to defame you - then the truth will come out how they abandoned you when your drink was spiked. \n\nNTA op do not go.", "NTA and your \"friends\" sound horrible. Why bother saying you're not gonna go? Ghost them. Give them a blackout from your life like the one you had that night. They don't deserve your words. Also, don't be afraid to share your story.

You needed support and they didn't want to give it because they left you alone in a club and didn't have your back. They are not your friends. I'm glad you're getting helped and simply tell her the quick and dirty version of what happened. I'm guess you were drugged and sexually assaulted. Being drugged is serious and scary enough and psychologically traumatic and should have deserved support and comfort  from them. It's terrifying.", "nta.... did they not understand you were raped? did you goto the police to file report?\n\nso sorry to hear this. just do wjat younneed to to start the healing process, the wedding does jot matter.", "NTA. They are dispicable humans. Never talk to any of them again.", "NTA\n\nMy sympathies.  Your so-called friends let you down badly.  To hell with them.  You deserve better.\n\nPlease look into therapy for dealing with the situation.  There will be questions about why you're no longer friends with them and the therapist can give you the words to express your feelings and and a safe space to vent.", "NTA. They put their \"good time\" above your assault, trauma, and need for support. These do not sound like good friends, and you have every right to distance yourself from them.

It\u2019s important to drink responsibly which entails MAKING SURE YOUR FRIENDS ARE OK regardless if the night is \u201cabout you\u201d or not. Shit happens and no one deserves to have something happen to them because they had a few too many during a celebration. The fact that they left you there, didn\u2019t give a shit about what happened, and then berated you for needing space to process AND called you a liar despite having medical proof, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not going to the wedding.

I would send one group text.  \u201cI was drugged and assaulted and my supposed friends did not have my back and blamed me for not being happy about it\u201d.  Friends don\u2019t act that way so since you are definitely NOT my friends you\u2019ll be happy to hear that I will not be attending the wedding.

They left you in a major city at the hands of the person or persons that spiked your drink.  Then they call you cruel names.  They are not friends, by leaving you in that condition they are accessories.  As they are more or less making a joke of it, please let the cops know what is going down.

Either way, nothing at all suggests someone OP was with spiked her drink.  Why the fuck would someone in the bachelorette party spike her drink?

I deleted my original comment when presented with the information.", "You need to reread the post. There is a sentence in which OP says she sought medical help.

I'm going to go ahead and quote from her post.\n\n\"On the third night I had three drinks and then blacked out and could not remember what had happened. **When I was in better shape I was able to seek medical help, and they sadly confirmed my suspicions**.

At this point I was very upset and also in physical pain.\"\n\nSo her suspicions were confirmed. What suspicions you say? I dunno dude, this is where your context clues should pretty much come into play. \n\nFurther confirming that is the fact that she was in physical pain from whatever happened that night.\n\nHuh.

I knew some context was missing there. I just had no idea what she was suspicious of.", "No, I deleted it because I saw OPs comment about what happened, after someone mentioned the information was in the comments. I didn't even  know OP was a victim of a crime. I assumed she blacked out due to overconsumption of alcohol. I assumed the medical treatment that was mentioned was referring to treatment for alcohol poisoning.\n\nI was only condescending to the people who were rude to me for the judgement I made based on an incomplete story.\n\nWhy do you have such a hard time accepting my judgement is different depending on why OP blacked out? Of it was drugs she consumed that were completely under her control it's a completely different situation than drugs that were consumed not under her control.", "[deleted]", "Automatically assuming whatever happened to her was her fault, rather than read the post where it CLEARLY was not her fault and CLEARLY spelled out, even before the added information was given, is not a good look dude, no matter how much you bluster."]}
