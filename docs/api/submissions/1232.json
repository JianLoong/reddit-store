She literally can\u2019t do the thing you\u2019re expecting of her. And what she is doing is actually helping her to get there, as rough as it is for the older humans around her. That\u2019s what toddlerhood is like.", "NTA. Your mom needs to control your sister better, and not get mad at you for sensory issues. I know how it feels to be overstimulated, probably not in the way you do, but I am familiar with the problem. Your sister is acting like a brat and needs to be disciplined. I suggest whenever this situation happens, just leave the house and go on a walk. Get away from the noisy environment to calm yourself, and your sister will not get the reaction out of you that she wants.", "NTA however, I know you may be autistic but she is 3 and while you may be interpreting her behavior as intentionally malicious, she is too young to truly understand your needs. \n\nYour parents should be parenting her better, have you asked for a lock on your door? As much as you really should understand she is a toddler, your parents shouldn't burden you with dealing with excessive bad behavior. \n\nBut again, she is 3. You can't hold too much against her. Good luck", "NTA. \n\nI understabd about the noise, I am also noise sensitive especially when I m tired.

She has \u00e0 high energy level. She is z child. You are also someone who is growing up.\n\nWHO IS RESPONSIBLE?\n\nYour parents. They are responsible to do something here. Help you with your struggle and educate your sister, hopefully through positive reinforcement. \n\nAlso, the truth is better than a lie. And also she is 3. She cant comprehend things the way you do yet.\n\nShe does sound like she is \"getting away\" with things.

You specifically say she\u2019s trying to trigger you and talk like she\u2019s doing things maliciously, but that simply is not the case.  Kids are loud, energetic, and most of all, they are hard to control sometimes.  And they don\u2019t respond well to yelling.  I don\u2019t want to say you are an asshole because it clearly is affecting you, but you need to be more patient with your sibling.  As an older brother myself, it can take patience, but your younger sister is going to look up to you and want to find a source of support and knowledge, and it\u2019s important that you can be that for her.  I\u2019m sure she really loves you and she isn\u2019t considering your triggers when she acts like that, it sounds like she just enjoys being around you.  So try to be more patient and understanding, but also talk to your parents about helping you through some of this, especially with everything going on.

I am going to say even with a diagnosis of autism, nothing is going to change very much and you need to start learning coping mechanisms.  I would ask your mom if you can put a key lock on your door to keep your sister out to protect your stuff and give you a safe space with less stimulus.  I would buy some of those noise canceling headphones.  They are $15 and can make a world of difference if you need to be out in noise to dull it enough.  You aren\u2019t sick.  You have a different way of processing the world.  And while being aware of neurodivergent issues is useful, using it as an excuse is not.", "NAH.  Yes, your sensory issues are debilitating.  Your sister is THREE.  She does not yet understand what you are going through.", "SHE'S 3!...she may barely know to stop what she's doing to go the the bathroom. Her attention span is non-existant. I'm sorry you have sensory issues but it is not an excuse to be short with her.", "NAH\n\nYou\u2019re an early teenager, you probably has some things you\u2019re worrying about. Friends, relationships, school. maybe puberty\u2019s also coming idk. And now there\u2019s this little human running around the house and I can understand why you\u2019re stressed. You have a 10-year age gap and sometimes it\u2019s hard to bridge that gap. I have cousins with that gap and most of the time I can\u2019t connect with them. + with your being sensitive to noise and babies with their screaming tantrums (which is normal) just tops it off.\n\nBut the reality here is your sister\u2019s 3. She doesn\u2019t have the level of self-awareness that you think she has. She\u2019s not being an evil little mastermind.\n\nI think right now you just need to cope with the fact that you have a baby sister who\u2019s at the age of being highly energetic. If you have things you\u2019d really not want to be messed with, move it somewhere she can\u2019t reach. Maybe lock the room if you can.\n\nI can\u2019t really say YTA because frankly you\u2019re also a kid and you also need your needs met. You\u2019re noise-sensitive so even if the entire house can\u2019t keep the volume low at all times, they need to be aware of how much it stresses you out and try to control how much noise they\u2019re making. Maybe try to have a serious talk with them.", "Look she is 3 and 3 year olds suck. \n\nESH \n\nMy kid has sensory issues, but has been in OT since she was 3 and at 6 we know what her triggers are and exercises to assist in avoiding them the best we can.  So i get it.  But your sister is 3 and doesn't get what sensory issues are but understands your reaction. You have younger siblings, little kids equal loud.  You can't expect the whole house to be quiet because of your sensory issues. \n\n\nYOU:  Look your sister is the product of her environment in which your parents have raised her. Not providing any discipline..\n\n You don't want her to take your things, you put them in the many tall and out of reach places she can't reach.  How does she get your homework, remote or phone? Cause you leave them in so many places. She looks at you, grins and runs off isn't bad, it's a 3 year old.  SHE DOESNT KNOW WHAT YOUR FAVORITE BOOK IS, SO PUT YOUR FAVORITE THINGS SOMEWHERE SHE CANT GET.\n\n\nGet headphones for yourself to reduce noise.  \n\n\nYour sister is doing this for ATTENTION.  If she takes the books out, why not just let her or try redirecting her by distracting her by offering to do something else.  OR When she is tired of the books she will leave them.  She wants your reaction and you give it to her.  You don't want her to scream?  Stop putting them back and act like you want to do it with her.\n\n\nYOUR PARENTS: They should be ensuring that some form of discipline for the 3 year old so that they don't grow up to be an adult version of a 3 year old.", "She's... 3. She's behaving like a 3 yr old. She's not trying to trigger you. YOU are getting triggered by her being a a child.\n\nMess might drive you nuts, you may have sensory issues, but talk to your parents and get a hold on it. Get help. \n\nLots of adults use the same excuse as you and say \"Do you think I WANT to yell??? I can't control the automatic reaction!\". They use this to justify abusive behavior. Yes it's common sense that you want to NOT do that, but you ARE. So doesn't matter. \"Can't control it\", is an explanation of the response but not an excuse.\n\nYou're young and have time to learn better ways to handle this. But while learning to do that, you cannot take it out on others, especially 3 yr olds. You're only teaching her that if she doesn't \"behave\" she'll be yelled at.\n\nOther people are not responsible for managing your triggers and it's better you learn that as early as possible. And people may unintentionally trigger you occasionally. You still have zero right to take it out on them. It's for YOU to learn to handle.

YTA for screaming at a little girl.", "I'm not going to give any judgments here, but your post implies that because your sister \"has been informed\" of your difficulties, she should have the self control, awareness, and empathy not to scream and take your things. But like...your sister is *3.* She is simply not capable of that level of foresight and understanding. She does not understand that she is hurting you. She did not \"decide\" to trigger you. She doesn't know what a trigger is or how it feels for you. \n\n>She is aware of how much screaming and how many tantrums she had that day.\r  \n\r\n\nHow can you possibly claim this? She's just barely learned to count! You can be upset and frustrated at how much and how often she triggers you - you *do not need to ascribe malicious intent* in order for those feelings to be valid. \n\nI think you should ask your parents to help you with ways to cope with your sensory issues to *prevent* getting to the point where you're overloaded. For example, could they get you noise cancelling earphones or earbuds, or some high quality earplugs? Can they get you a locked trunk or something to keep your important things (backpack, etc) in to prevent her from taking them? Can you figure out a quiet space you can walk to and calm down when you notice things are getting too loud?", "Soft YTA. A toddler is not plotting against you.

I know younger siblings can be exhausting, but she's little, not evil", "NAH. \n\nBut please keep in mind that your sister similarly struggles to regulate her reactions due her age. If you want people to understand the struggles you face as a result of your autism, you need to equally understand the struggles that toddlers face not being understood.

Your parents need to start getting on to her. I'd she does steal something don't chase unless it's dangerous. Take something of hers to trade back.

Pretty darn problematic, actually. You're not sick, and that's a really lazy way of contextualizing things for your little siblings.\n\n>She then goes into the room where she begins dragging out loads of books and making lines with them, so I put the books back, and she went off on one, screaming and yelling and shouting\n\nJesus, is anyone parenting this kid? \n\n>I snapped again and wanted it to stop, I didn't think because when noise gets to me, all logic goes flying out the window.\n\nThat's fairly common with ASD, as I understand it. I'm hardly an expert on the subject, mind you, but I've had friends with ASD describe their sensory experiences to me as something much more physically intense than what a neurotypical person would feel. \n\nWhich is to say, I know I don't *get it*, because I don't experience the world that way, and so it's on me to listen and to change my worldview accordingly.\n\n>my mum comes in and starts screaming at me for yelling, when my sister seems to always be yelling and there is never anything sorted with her.\n\nAnd this suggests to me that your mom doesn't even realize yet that she doesn't *get it.* If she's getting you tested for autism, she must at least suspect something, and you'd think she'd have started reading up.\n\nBut that aside, again, where is the parenting here when it comes to your little sister? When is she going to be told to leave your belongings alone?\n\n>My mum then talks to my dad and explains what happened, not mentioning where my sister decided to trigger me and continue to laugh and have fun trying to trigger my difficulties with noise.\n\nOkay, gently, I'm going to suggest that you're directing your anger to the wrong place. \n\nYour sister is 3. She literally isn't capable of understanding the effect that she's having on you right now, because her brain hasn't grown enough to have that level of awareness. She's at the stage where she understands actions and consequences, and that's all. She knows that when she screams, you react, and she is not old enough yet to understand why that isn't okay.\n\nWhat she needs is the consistent, recurring lesson that it isn't okay. The problem here is with your folks. Your mom should be paying attention to the way your sister is behaving around you, and recognizing that her behaviour may be intentional, and correcting it on *that* level. Your sister *needs that*, and so do you.\n\n**NTA.**", "If you are autistic, you have some things going on. \n\nYour hearing is more sensitive than typical people.  Basically you hear everything.

She is a toddler, she has no idea what\u2019s going on or what the issue is.

I'm waiting for appointments and stuff. \n\nI need to work on it yes, but when every damn noise in the house comes into your head at once and you start to get hot because you're becoming overwhelmed and a sort of energy that needs to just get tf away, I didn't even feel myself doing it, and I know it's not a justification just felt like explaining that part. \n\nI'm not trying to teach her anything, it was an overload of noise.\n\nI never said other people need to change or adapt in any way. I know that, I'm not entitled to anyone's adaptations. I don't even try and do it, it's like an itch that you have to scratch except I'm not aware of the itch but it's still there. Again, NOT TRYING TO JUSTIFY. \n\nThanks for the response", "Hi I have just updated my post because I forgot to add this part because I tried to upload a few minutes ago but it exceeded characters. \n\nI didn't mean to actually shout at her. It's sort of an automatic reaction, like something that happens before I know it really. \n\nFigured I'd add context. I will definetly work on it.", "I didn't mean to yell and I've said this in a billion other comments and in my edit, I didn't want to or even really mean to shout, it's a weird automatic response which happens before I've even realized it's happened.", "Hi, figured I'd clear jo the part about the claiming bit. \n\nI meant my mum, I should have made that clearer. I had this copied out to rant on a notepad but decided to see what others thought. \n\nI meant my mum, I know my sister doesent know how many tantrums she has. \n\nI have ear defenders, they just don't seem to block it out enough because it still triggers me.", "I realize that, accept the judgment. \n\nI had headphones on at the time, ear defenders but they're the same. It's a trigger and I never mean to even say anything I'll be honest. \n\nThanks for the response", "Hi, yeah, I have noise cancelling headphones but they don't really work, so either the ear defenders I have aren't great or I have annoyingly sensitive hearing. Or both.", "I never said I wanted or needed accomodations, I need to edit my post again. I've been around her most the time for the past 2 weeks constantly, with shouting and yelling. \n\nYou don't need to insult, just give your judgement, you know you'd find that spending 2 weeks straight listening to shouting and yelling with everyone at home becomes frustrating. \n\nEven more so because I've been home for 2 months because of a fit because of a sensory overload which I'm trying to sort, but no luck.", "I'll start doing that from now on if she does. Thank you!", "Hi I have just updated my post because I forgot to add this part because I tried to upload a few minutes ago but it exceeded characters. \n\nI didn't mean to actually shout at her.

She doesn't really put them in lines. More throws them everywhere all around the room and then leaves and does it again. \n\nNever thought about vocal stim, but that definitely is interesting.", "Hi, I have ear defenders but they don't really block the sound out. They more muffle slightly so it's not exactly ideal but it works for now. \n\nYou can hear screaming anywhere in the house and even outside the house you can hear it. \n\nThanks for the comment", "> My parents won't let me get a lock\n\nCan you at least block access to your room while you are in it? Maybe put something heavy against the door?\n\nCan you add soundproofing panels to your walls? I knew a music teacher who unzipped and hung up those thick sleeping bags on her walls to try to contain the noise.\n\nIs there something creepy that scares her that you can put on a high shelf so she doesn\u2019t want to come in to your room? You can always interact nicely in the common areas but then retreat to your room before you overload.\n\nI know it feels like she is intentionally setting you off. Maybe she understands more then we realize. It is more likely that she has discovered that loud noises get powerful responses and she enjoys that without truly understanding she is hurting you. Maybe you can retrain her such as every time she yells, say nothing. Ignore her as if she wasn\u2019t there and immediately leave the room. When she is calm, play with her nicely and repeat that loud noises hurt you and you can only play with her when she is not screaming. If she makes loud noises you have to go play by yourself until she finishes.", "I think your frustration and displeasure is completely justified.  I just think being an older sibling sometimes means needing to be patient through that.  But with your triggers there\u2019s more to it so it would be best to have your parents help.  I don\u2019t think you should beat yourself up over this.  Just stuff to consider moving forward.  Your sister is 3, so she won\u2019t remember this at all and it won\u2019t affect her relationship with you unless it persists.  You sound like you care and I\u2019m confident you\u2019ll do great moving forward.", "You need to put the work in here, you can't expect the whole world to change to avoid your triggers.  My daughter has sensory processing disorder and I have researched and brought her to OT.  I get it as a 14 year old you can't do it all yourself.  Ask your parents to get you to OT and you should Google things.  \n\nMy daughter has it with clothes and noise.  Imagine feelings like clothes you were wearing were like wearing razor blades.  You can get noise reducing headphones and research OT exercises that can help reduce behavior caused by triggers.\n\n\n You have the ability to do sensory integration at OT so you can introduce more and more noise so that it becomes less triggering because you may not be able to wear headphones all day every day your whole life.  My daughter has exercises and I have to brush her skin to get her to wear her triggering clothes because she wants to do things like the other kids do that require clothes that trigger but im able to find non triggering clothes for her to wear at all other times.", "I do hope it all works out for you cos it\u2019s very evident that the whole situation is overwhelming you. But hey, if the family can\u2019t find a solution that\u2019ll satisfy everyone, there\u2019s noise-cancelling headphones? If it becomes too much, maybe go outside for awhile and take some breather. because the toddler situation\u2019s gonna take some time.", "With my daughter who had sensory and triggers the best way to avoid the impulse is to distract.  So when that impulse comes to put them back try to remember the screaming that will happen and then distract yourself by asking her a million questions or asking her to show you something in her room or show her something you don't care about in a different room so you both are distracted from it.  The best way to numb impulses and triggers is to integrate into your disorders.  The more you leave the books where she is playing and walking away, the more you distract her and yourself, the easier it will be going forward.  By spending time with your sister and having fun with her, will lessen her bad behavior towards you because it seems like she wants your attention and this is the only way to get it.", ">Does it matter, I'm triggered by most noises if they're loud, high pitched or annoyingly low pitched. \n\n>I have selective mutism so anytime anyone asks me a question my brain tells me no and nothing comes out, so it doesn't really help I'll admit. \n\nI understand that and I'm sorry that's how it is for you. I have a couple of triggers that are constantly being \"attacked\" so I do get it.\n\nI used to take it out on people unintentionally too until I got a lot of therapy & life experiences. But burned a lot of bridges with my \"unintentional\" reactions.\n\n>Do you not think I'm trying to get help? I'm waiting for appointments and stuff. \n\nThat's great then. I do hope it helps. I also hope your parents take it very seriously as well. Good luck", "You couldn't control yourself so you should understand that your 3yo sister doesn't know how to control herself yet. She's still learning and developing as a human being so just be a bit more understanding.", "I see what you mean. I'd say that your mom should be a little more active in keeping your sister directed away from you and calming you down, but I don't know the exact situation - you can't keep a 3 year old behaved 24/7 in her own home!\n\nMaybe another type of ear defenders could help, or listening to music/white noise? To some extent it's still going to bother you and it's a shitty situation, but the goal would be to reduce it enough to give you time to realize what's happening and step away.", "I have many siblings, and I grew up as the oldest. I was outside when they were loud inside. I remember being your age and it was a tough time; try not to take it out on your sister. I hope things get better", "Your parents should get you some noise cancelling headphones.  I'd wear mine 24/7 if I were forced to live within screaming distance of a toddler", "That sounds like a you problem. If it\u2019s a mess but it\u2019s keeping the piece then who cares? The world dosent revolve around you nor your sister so you will need to learn how to deal with your own issues instead of use them as excuses to justify your actions of taking it out on a toddler. It dosent matter if you meant to or not you still did it and part of being the bigger person is self control.", "My daughter uses Vibe ear plugs. She really likes them.", "I will try these suggestions. Thanks, these are some really good suggestions", "I actually got ear defenders, but they either don't work well or I have annoyingly sensitive hearing.", "I think my parents would have to do the opposite with me when it comes to questions, it seems I have some sort of selective mutism, I can't talk if it's a question, especially if I'm overloaded. \n\nThanks for your suggestions", "Thank you for your help.", "Will do. And I get you, it's just difficult. I'm at home full time at the moment because of a situation similar to this in a sense there was a lot of shouting, which then caused a fit. \n\nI'm gonna work on it.", "Thanks for your comment! I", "I have them, they just aren't... Great.
