Our daughter turns 15 later this month, and we had a birthday party planned for her but in light of recent events, we decided to cancel. \n\nOur daughter is friends with some popular mean girls. We are working on things like therapy and consequences. Unfortunately, her latest behavior was the worst yet. Our son is very sweet and hasn\u2019t run into any issues with him being mean yet. \n\nOur son met a girl on a cruise we went on in April of last year, the girl lives about 40 minutes away, so they don\u2019t go to the same school. My son and the girl hung out together the whole cruise and started dating soon after.\n\nHis girlfriend is an absolute sweetheart, very bright and loves sports like my son. The girl is also Indian-American, she was born here and so were her parents but both sides of her family have relatives in India. The girl and her family went to India last month and my son was invited many months ago, we signed all the paperwork needed and he was able to go with them. They came back a few days ago, my son really enjoyed it and brought back souvenirs (some sports stuff) for himself and family members. One of those family members was our 5 year old niece, who is my sister and her husband\u2019s daughter. \n\nHe had brought handmade dolls for my niece, my sister lives about 5 minutes away, my son sometimes babysits for my sister. They also have a son, which he also got gifts for. The issue is, the day he came back, my sister and husband came over with their son and daughter to get the gifts. My daughter had her friends over, while he was presenting the gifts, our daughter and her friends were in the living room with us, we could hear laughing when he presented the dolls and a few of the girls had their phones out. At the time, my husband and I thought nothing of it, we thought they were on TikTok. My sister, her husband and my husband and I eventually left the house to get food we ordered. We came back, they ate and left.\n\nThe next day, I got a phone call from my sister saying that her daughter was asking her if the dolls were ugly, and she said my daughter said something about it. We immediately went to her room, asked her what happened, she giggled and refused to answer, when we asked for her phone, she refused, so we shut the Wi-Fi off until she gave in. She and her friends had posted an Instagram story making fun of the dolls. My husband and I decided that with her increasing mean streak, this was the final straw and told her that her friends were toxic and that she wouldn\u2019t have a 15th birthday party bc of her actions. When I called my parents to tell them the party was canceled, they got mad at me and told me I over reacted, my sister and other siblings are saying I\u2019m doing the right thing and our son told us he\u2019s giving his sister the silent treatment and is very mad at her.

She\u2019s five years old.", "NTA. You mentioned your daughter is in therapy, but how effective can therapy be if she's still hanging out with mean girls? You didn't put in your post why you think your daughter is so attracted to horrible people, but depending on the reason, a different therapist or even school may be called for. Your daughter's behavior was not only cruel but xenophobic, and what she posts today could haunt her the rest of her life.\n\nI don't know why people are acting like this is an escalation.

Do they at least keep these discussions between them and you, or do they tell your daughter? Posting private family stuff on Instagram is a major breach of trust.", "YTA: cancelling her birthday over this is an excessive punishment. That being said, I do think it is important for you to control your daughter before her mean streak escalates beyond snarky remarks. Your daughter is also old enough that you dont need to resort to these types of punishments- first try sitting her down and explaining that she is being an asshole and then try to limit her time with those friends. Make her apologize to her little cousin and brother and if she refuses then you should escalate punishments. Idk if this overreaction is due to other issues, but if this is the worst thing she has done then i would be more understanding/ work with her to stop it- often when teenagers act out like this they are going through something themselves.", "NTA.

It is disappointing to read her gparent's opinion. \n\nYour daughter is gaining something from this group.  She may not be strong enough (lacks forethought or social skills) to navigate the mean group mentality. \n\nSince you mentioned therapy, consider asking the counselor if you and your husband can join a session with the goal of a guided discussion on what is her personal opinion about her action re: the dolls, what does she gain from these friendships...essentially remaining curious to know how she views things and what factors support the decisions she is making. This may generate insight for all involved. The counselor can help you all re: discussion skills which include valuing everyone's opinion equally, etc. Parenting is hard sometimes but you only have her for 3 yrs before 18.

Every bit of OP's child's behavior was unwarranted and bratty. \n\nThis isn't a first instance but an ongoing problem and hopefully it will sink in that OP is damn serious, and not playing.", "People lose jobs over stuff like that, get kicked out of schools, etc. So yeah, daughter needs to learn right now this won't be tolerated. Not to mention she's being a bully and it's not a good look.", "Is your daughter also being racist as you mention your son's girlfriend being Indian American? \nBut nonetheless NTA you are being good parents,  I hope your daughter changes.", "I'm wondering if the grandparents favour their granddaughter over their grandson. They are the only ones fighting OP about the cancelled party, make you wonder how they'd react if the son had behaved this way.", "Dating is one thing. Letting your child travel internationally with people you've known less than a year is a problem", "I mean, you say the party is unrelated but seeing as it's going to be a gathering of all her \"mean girl\" friends, it definitely fits the crime to a degree. I'd actually argue that the best thing to help her get better would be to cut her off from the toxic AHs she calls her friends. That's where she's learning and getting this behaviour from.", "There is a difference between discouraging bad behavior and encouraging good behavior. Teenage years are hard to navigate and it\u2019s important to present some kind of role model, examples, or come to some kind of understanding of how things should go. Just punishment without setting new positive expectations sounds like a recipe for resentment instead of improvement. I\u2019d agree ESH.", "I\u2019m saying that if the target of the mockery is unaware of it, the daughter should not be punished the same as if the child were aware of it.  Let the consequences be commensurate with the offense.", "i really hope you aren't serious.\n\nThe child was aware of what was going on, just not the level of it, or that this kid is a 'mean girl'. She is young enough that she doesn't really know what being a 'mean girl' is. That doesn't make it acceptable.\n\n Telling a child that a cultural gift they had received is 'ugly' is not only mean, but racist. I had a cultural doll made in Bangladesh, as well as India, Pakistan, Germany, other places. \n\nOP's Daughter knew clearly that the doll was from India, probably one of those cute craftsy kind of dolls and immediately targeted it as 'ugly'. I hope OP definitely deals with that portion of this as well.", "Oh, ok! I did read that wrong! Sorry! Thanks!", "Oh, so I'm not the only one! Thanks! This site is so mean sometimes. I got downvoted just for asking an innocent question.", "I disagree with your first point, but I understand where you\u2019re coming from. I just feel like \u201cMy family doesn\u2019t care about my iPhone 14, so why should I care about them?\u201d doesn\u2019t have the same emotional impact.\n\nI do, however, agree that she deserves consequences. I just don\u2019t agree with this consequence. While it may solve things short-term, I think it will do more harm than good in the long run. I\u2019m good with agreeing to disagree on this though, parenting is weird!", "I love when you ask for info on these posts and you get downvoted. Why?!", "Totally! I wish I had an answer for that! Maybe a good question for the Ask Reddit sub! lol", "That doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s upset. Again, you\u2019re adding something that isn\u2019t there.", "Talk about \u201creading comprehension.\u201c Show me the line where it says the daughter was upset.  Just because she mention it doesn\u2019t mean she was upset. She may have found it strange bewildering. But you\u2019re assuming something that\u2019s not written into the OP.", "What are you reading that would indicate anything other than the niece was upset.", "So she was being laughed at, assumed something was wrong with the dolls, and asked because she was just curious? Even if she wasnt upset and didn't know better, she was still being bullied and the daughters a AH.", "That\u2019s not how that works.  it\u2019s not my responsibility to prove that something is not there.", "She absolutely could\u2019ve been curious. Like I said, if she were actually upset she would\u2019ve cried. That\u2019s how five-year-olds express their emotions. Some posters on Reddit also act like five year olds.  The next time you want to leave a conversation, just stop replying.", "Well seemingly everyone else here read it that way but you soooo\u2026."]}
