Our daughter turns 15 later this month, and we had a birthday party planned for her but in light of recent events, we decided to cancel. \n\nOur daughter is friends with some popular mean girls. We are working on things like therapy and consequences. Unfortunately, her latest behavior was the worst yet. Our son is very sweet and hasn\u2019t run into any issues with him being mean yet. \n\nOur son met a girl on a cruise we went on in April of last year, the girl lives about 40 minutes away, so they don\u2019t go to the same school. My son and the girl hung out together the whole cruise and started dating soon after.\n\nHis girlfriend is an absolute sweetheart, very bright and loves sports like my son. The girl is also Indian-American, she was born here and so were her parents but both sides of her family have relatives in India. The girl and her family went to India last month and my son was invited many months ago, we signed all the paperwork needed and he was able to go with them. They came back a few days ago, my son really enjoyed it and brought back souvenirs (some sports stuff) for himself and family members. One of those family members was our 5 year old niece, who is my sister and her husband\u2019s daughter. \n\nHe had brought handmade dolls for my niece, my sister lives about 5 minutes away, my son sometimes babysits for my sister. They also have a son, which he also got gifts for. The issue is, the day he came back, my sister and husband came over with their son and daughter to get the gifts. My daughter had her friends over, while he was presenting the gifts, our daughter and her friends were in the living room with us, we could hear laughing when he presented the dolls and a few of the girls had their phones out. At the time, my husband and I thought nothing of it, we thought they were on TikTok. My sister, her husband and my husband and I eventually left the house to get food we ordered. We came back, they ate and left.\n\nThe next day, I got a phone call from my sister saying that her daughter was asking her if the dolls were ugly, and she said my daughter said something about it. We immediately went to her room, asked her what happened, she giggled and refused to answer, when we asked for her phone, she refused, so we shut the Wi-Fi off until she gave in. She and her friends had posted an Instagram story making fun of the dolls. My husband and I decided that with her increasing mean streak, this was the final straw and told her that her friends were toxic and that she wouldn\u2019t have a 15th birthday party bc of her actions. When I called my parents to tell them the party was canceled, they got mad at me and told me I over reacted, my sister and other siblings are saying I\u2019m doing the right thing and our son told us he\u2019s giving his sister the silent treatment and is very mad at her.

And yeah- she\u2019s losing her birthday party because of it. Also- talk to a counselor- teenage girls require a masters degree to decipher when it comes to this crap.", "Seems like a massive overreaction. Did the child even see the story? She\u2019s five years old.", "NTA. You mentioned your daughter is in therapy, but how effective can therapy be if she's still hanging out with mean girls? You didn't put in your post why you think your daughter is so attracted to horrible people, but depending on the reason, a different therapist or even school may be called for. Your daughter's behavior was not only cruel but xenophobic, and what she posts today could haunt her the rest of her life.\n\nI don't know why people are acting like this is an escalation. The vibe here is xenophobic at the least, racist at worst, and that needs to be nipped in the bud post-haste.", "NTA. Actions have consequences, and these seem proportional to the offense.", "You\u2019re NTA, but you\u2019re also clearly going to drive your daughter away from you.  Punishment should fit the crime, not escalate the situation.  \n\nA better approach might be sitting her down and explaining why that\u2019s a crappy thing to do, and instilling some lesser punishment.  It\u2019s certainly not good behavior, but it doesn\u2019t seem like \u201ccancel your birthday\u201d level\u2026 it\u2019s apologize, remove the post, and do something nice for the offended party level", "NYA - I\u2019m thinking your daughter needs to get away from these friends and into therapy ASAP. Narcissism isn\u2019t pretty.", "ESH. Your daughter for the mean behaviour obviously, but I also agree with the comments saying that this will push your daughter away. \n\nA birthday party is a once a year event, and not something she can ever earn back through consistent good behaviour. Through this punishment, you\u2019re not providing her with any reason/encouragement to try and be better.\n\nEDIT: If she already knew in advance that she could potentially lose her birthday party, my judgement may be different.", "NTA\nSeems like your parents are unnecessarily escalating. Do they at least keep these discussions between them and you, or do they tell your daughter? Posting private family stuff on Instagram is a major breach of trust.", "YTA: cancelling her birthday over this is an excessive punishment. That being said, I do think it is important for you to control your daughter before her mean streak escalates beyond snarky remarks. Your daughter is also old enough that you dont need to resort to these types of punishments- first try sitting her down and explaining that she is being an asshole and then try to limit her time with those friends. Make her apologize to her little cousin and brother and if she refuses then you should escalate punishments. Idk if this overreaction is due to other issues, but if this is the worst thing she has done then i would be more understanding/ work with her to stop it- often when teenagers act out like this they are going through something themselves.", "NTA. And much appreciation to you for trying to set her behavior on a better path. Unchecked bullies tend to remain bullies into adulthood, and the world doesn't need more AHs.", "NTA", "NTA She learnt the consequence of bullying a family member for her own amusement and hopefully it is a lesson well learnt.", "NTA...but you did give birth/raise one. This is not OK behavior and I am glad you are not letting it slide. Your son was very thoughtful and she was disrespectful and mean.", "NTA, but I recommend doing something low-key that\u2019s family only for your DD\u2019s birthday.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not rewarding bad behavior is the way to go. Taking her phone away and restricting her temporarily is good, too. She is seriously in need of a wake-up call and counseling could benefit her and the whole family, as well. This could make her friends even more desirable than ever but I don't see anything good coming from that. Maybe if she spends some time with those less fortunate and stops being mean to others, she'll begin to appreciate things more. You can also change schools.", "NTA - actions have consequences. Your daughter was very much behaving inappropriately.", "Nta sadly", "NTA- if your daughter presses you just respond \u201cyou fucked around, you found out. Hopefully what you found out was to stop fucking around and bullying a five year old.", "NTA Few reasons\n\n1) Kids need to learn at an early age, stuff posted online for everyone to see that is mean can and will bite you in the ass later on down the road, sometimes immediately, sometimes years later\n\n2) Being mean for no reason is just an awful thing to do, especially when you post it online.", "You're NTA. I get why some people think this was an overreaction, but if it weren't for the character limit, I am pretty sure you would have elaborated on the increasingly mean behavior you mentioned. It sounds like this was the last straw after a string of many other incidents and attempts to correct the behavior.", "NTA - She is old enough to have behavior consequences.  It is disappointing to read her gparent's opinion. \n\nYour daughter is gaining something from this group.  She may not be strong enough (lacks forethought or social skills) to navigate the mean group mentality. \n\nSince you mentioned therapy, consider asking the counselor if you and your husband can join a session with the goal of a guided discussion on what is her personal opinion about her action re: the dolls, what does she gain from these friendships...essentially remaining curious to know how she views things and what factors support the decisions she is making. This may generate insight for all involved. The counselor can help you all re: discussion skills which include valuing everyone's opinion equally, etc. Parenting is hard sometimes but you only have her for 3 yrs before 18. Do the hardwork OP (and dad). - BTW, It is cool that you are supporting your son's friendship which may last a lifetime.", "NTA. You're doing the right thing. Don't cave to family pressure and don't let them take her for the next 6 months or they will give her a \"make-up\" party. She needs to learn that actions have consequences.", "not the asshole even the slightist. my god parenting in this day and age is hard enough but because of phones and tiktok etc everything makes it that much harder. kids are constantly picking things up and think its ok to make fun and post on instagram something as sweet as a child getting a doll. behaviour like that needs massive consequences otherwise she will do sooo much more worse stuff because she will think its ok to da so. good on you for trying to make her realise what she did was wrong and not \"treating\" her for it with a party", "NTA Actions have consequences and if your daughter is behaving poorly she will lose out on opportunities.", "NTA, she needs to learn actions like bullying and being mean have consequences. Otherwise she'll just keep getting worse. Maybe you can tell her that once she apologizes and makes it right with all those involved, that she can have a small celebration with the family. She has to understand that being cruel isn't funny.", "NTA.  Actions have consequences.", "NTA she sounds insufferable.", "NTA - your daughter has to learn that she can act how she wants, but she will be judged for it. \n\nIt is telling though how the other parents seem to accept this behavior, so that may be why their kids do it.", "NTA. The world needs more parents like you.", "NTA at all.", "NTA. Honestly, you need to keep her away from her friends outside of school. They\u2019re clearly encouraging her behavior. It\u2019s easy to handwave this as teenager behavior, but this kind of behavior doesn\u2019t just go away. By middle school, most people knew who the mean girl types were, and many of them stayed that way all the way through high school.", "I would say NTA but something else struck me. Your 13 year old son is \u201cdating\u201d a girl and went to India with the family?  I have no objection to your decision about your daughter\u2019s birthday but the 13 year old dating is another story.", "NTA", "NTA. Good for you for trying to do something about your daughter's behavior before it gets even worse", "NTA   I would have punched her a lot harder than you are if I were you", "NTA, actions have consequences.", "NTA, at ALL, you need to punish that behavior and a grounding + no birthday party seems fair, maybe even the cell phone for a few days \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the bright side it sounds like you have a great well functioning son who has a great future ahead of him, congratulations on raising him well and to care about his family.\n\nYou gotta figure out how to nip that attitude out, but ive never been a parent, I dont have advice on that.\n\nBest of luck OP", "NTA and your daughter is experiencing consequences severe enough to get her attention.

My bro always preferred to have his birthday party one month or so later so it would be into summer instead of exams time. The daughter can win a night out/ home party if she learns to behave better. At this age, I think it was an appropriate punishment", "I'm wondering if the grandparents encourage the xenophobia the daughter is expressing.", "This. You need a punishment that fits the crime. Delete Instagram and TikTok on her phone, for example. Cancelling her party for something unrelated can feel so cruel and unfair. Find a punishment that would actually help her get better.", "Are you saying it's OP's fault that the daughter is the way she is? Or am I reading that wrong?", "yea i had to edit it down a lot from the first draft lol", "It\u2019s a normal age for a relationship and he\u2019s able to get wonderful experiences out of it which is a bonus", "i know a lot of people who dated at this age, it's just an innocent middle school relationship", "That\u2019s normal and they\u2019re clearly doing it with parental supervision.", "You aadded a lot of stuff that isn\u2019t in the OP.", "\u201cMy family doesn\u2019t even care about my birthday, why should I care about them/what they think of me?\u201d.

However, this post didn\u2019t mention this as a possibility, only that it was cancelled, so my judgement was based on what was provided. \n\nIn addition, if she didn\u2019t communicate this to her daughter, she\u2019s not going to know, and react accordingly.", "No i pointed out the AH in the scenario is the daughter.

The OP says they could \u201chear laughing.\u201c  that suggests that the girls were somewhere in the distance or background.\n\nIf her daughter and friends were obviously making fun of the knees, then the OP would\u2019ve recognized that. Doubtful that a five-year-old would know if the adults don\u2019t know. Also, OP never said that the niece was upset, just asking if the doll was ugly.
