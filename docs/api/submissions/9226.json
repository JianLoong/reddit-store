That being said, I do think it is important for you to control your daughter before her mean streak escalates beyond snarky remarks. Your daughter is also old enough that you dont need to resort to these types of punishments- first try sitting her down and explaining that she is being an asshole and then try to limit her time with those friends. Make her apologize to her little cousin and brother and if she refuses then you should escalate punishments. Idk if this overreaction is due to other issues, but if this is the worst thing she has done then i would be more understanding/ work with her to stop it- often when teenagers act out like this they are going through something themselves.", "NTA.
