On top of that, you have three young kids. You obviously can't care for your sister, and that is understandable. Chances are, she'd have a better quality of life in a home where she's given the professional care she clearly needs.\n\nHOWEVER, you absolutely would be the asshole if you did not start making payments to pay off that downpayment money you accepted immediately.\n\nETA: Yes, to be clear, you also need to be completely upfront with your parents and nip this in the bud right now. They need to know that you will not be taking in your sister so they can figure out how to best move forward. And they seem completely oblivious as to how these things work, so I HIGHLY recommend you help get them in touch with legal help to navigate their plans for her future care. Leaving her an inheritance, for example, could really be problematic when it comes to her assistance. \n\nA decent care home will have a long waiting list. They seem to think they can just wait until their health declines then deal with it then, but by then it could be too late. You mentioned reaching out to someone at a local nonprofit who helped, try getting some assistance in figuring out the best plan for your sister's long-term care, someone who is familiar with how things work in your state and what her best options are for homes is the best thing you could do for your sister.", "NTA but start a repayment schedule for that money they gave you. And encourage them to get going on their planning for Paula's future. She should be getting home services asap to relieve them of some of the burden.", "\"You promised that there would be supports in place if I took her, and you have not done your part. Without those supports, it's not possible for me to take her in. There's no point in discussing it, because it is simply not possible. But I do care about Paula, so I'm willing to have the conversation *after* you do your part. I'm going to give you a list of things you *must* do and once you have done everything on the list, we can revisit the conversation.\" And then give them a list with everything you've mentioned here, plus anything else you think would be necessary... I'd include something about increasing her opportunities for regular social interactions\n\nNTA. Planning for Paula's future is difficult and scary. I totally get why your parents are reluctant to do so, especially if they've already discounted some of the viable options. They have a nearly overwhelming amount of work in front of them, and they are likely to feel extremely anxious because there aren't \"good\" options, only \"potentially workable\" ones.\n\nIt's much, much easier if they tell themselves that \"OP will take care of it\" and let themselves off the hook. After all, even if they know it isn't realistic, they can pretend that you will magically figure everything out.\n\nBut that is not fair of them. They're breaking their promise to you, and they are failing Paula. And not only failing her in the future, they're failing her in the present too: the stuff you described with her regressing? That is a clear sign of something being very wrong. (My first instinct is to guess depression, possibly related to isolation. Obviously, I don't know Paula, but my organization works with developmentally disabled adults and our stats show that there has been a marked increase in anxiety and depression due to COVID-related disruptions)", "I have a child that may never be able to live on his own. If he can't I'm going to find an assisted living facility or something so he'll be safe when I can't care for him anymore.  The only thing I plan on asking my other kids to do is step in if, God forbid,  something happens and hrs getting abused or something like that. However you did accept the money so you need to pay it back.", "No NTA. If you can\u2019t do it, you can\u2019t do it. You should, however, return the down payment money as soon as you are able because that money was intended for her care.", "I can speak from a position of knowledge as I have an adult disabled son (not Down syndrome, but profoundly disabled).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour parents have fallen into the trap of failing to plan for the care of Paula by assuming that she would always be cared for by family.  This is unfair to family members and also unfair to Paula.  Exhibit 1: What happens if/when all siblings predecease Paula?  Not likely since people with Down syndrome often have heart problems and die fairly young, but it could happen.  \n\n\nI'll tell you what we did with our son.  We went to court and got named as his guardians (in some states they are called conservators) when he turned 18 so that we would still be able to speak for him even though he was an adult.  Then, as soon as he aged out of school at 22, we placed him in a group home.  This was paid for by the county (or maybe the state, I don't recall).  He also started receiving SSI benefits.  Additionally, we made sure that he attended a day program so he wasn't just sitting around all day.  We stayed involved in his life by having him come home to stay with us every other weekend.  I became his \"representative payee\" and manage his SSI benefits.  We have since added our son's elder brother as a third guardian, and he will take over management in a few years as we are getting old.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou could do the same for Paula.  Once you have taken her in and get named as her guardian/conservator, then YOU are in control and your parents no longer have a say.  To suggest that if she is placed in a home she will \"die\" is ludicrous.  (I will say, though, that she will have a harder time adjusting than if she had been placed at 22 instead of at 40.  But it's still better than placing her at 65, which would be a disaster.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are NTA.  Your parents are also NTA, but many people in their position are just in denial about their disabled children and cannot bring themselves to see institutional placement as anything other than \"abandonment.\"", "Start a repayment plan that pays it \"back\" to Paula's trust.", "NTA. I understand your parents strong desire to keep Paula with family when they're unable to care for her... I have a T21 kid so I REALLY understand. Their terms were wonderful but if they aren't following through that's an issue. \n\nYou (and every other human) have the right to change your mind. Paula has a higher risk of developing dementia or Alzheimer's so I truly hope she's being evaluated appropriately. Good luck!", "Info has Paula been assessed for dementia which sadly can start to develop in people with Downs Syndrome when they are quite young. Depression should also be ruled out.", "YWBTA to not start paying back the down payment money now. But you are NTA to realize your sister needs more care than you are able to provide.", "One -you should have not taken the money. \nTwo- best option is a group home through an agency. They will take care of her and supply her with all her needs. They will take 70% of her monthly income from SSI or SSD. Obviously this is not enough to cover 24 hour care which is why many of these agencies are state funded. The rest of her money will go towards co-pays, clothing, spending money, and outings. Obviously say she doesn\u2019t have enough for new clothes the agency will pick up the cost. They are taken care of, granted it will never be as good as their own parents.  Unfortunately, this is the path for most DDD individuals. No one can offer 24 hour care like their parents and as they age their medical needs become me extensive.", "NTA, but pay the money back as soon as you can. \n\nCaring for someone with problems like this is difficult. I imagine you feel badly about not being able to help your sister, which I understand, but you have a family and that family comes first.\n\nWe had a similar situation when my MIL proposed living with each of her four kids (one of whom is my husband) for 3 mos each out of the year. I told my husband we could not do that; we had two kids in school at the time, and I was not prepared to take care of someone else. This was not a matter of not caring about my MIL; her proposal was simply not feasible for various reasons, mostly the state of her health.\n\nYour parents are hurting both themselves and Paula by their refusal to make any changes or plans. I hope you can convince them to start making plans, maybe tell them what the non-profit told you -- although I fully expect they'd find a way to deny or deflect.\n\nGood luck.", "As a parent of a disabled child who will never live independently - NTA. Absolutely NTA. Your parents are for trying to make you responsible for the care of your sibling. I understand so well their terror and why they want this so badly, but Paula is NOT your responsibility. Pay them back as quickly as possible and find alternative appropriate care for her.", "NTA\n\nYou were mislead because your parents wanted you to say yes no matter what. This was an unfair deal and they know it.\n\nIf I were you, that down payment should just go back towards your sister's care when your parents pass. That way no one can say you took the money and ran. It will be used as intended for Paula.", "NTA. Your parents put you on the spot. You were promised resources to assist you with caring for your sister, resources needed to care for her. They are not fulfilling their end of the bargain, but expect you to fulfill yours. I\u2019d tell them that they have two years to figure out all of the resources promised, or you\u2019ll be paying back the money and you\u2019ll make sure Paula is in safe home where she\u2019s cared for.", "The situation changed, but you gotta start re-paying that money so they can figure out something. at this point NTA but... it's close. You should have done your research initially!!!! I don't think your parents are free of blame either, and one could argue they misled you, but it's also possible at the time they weren't lying so... But you gotta get out of this and make things right on the money.", "NTA, the situation changed and parents majorly dropped the ball on both maintaining their part of the bargain and taking steps to secure Paula's future. \n\nThat said, be prepared to work out a repayment plan for money received, ideally in the form of a care fund for Paula.  She needs help the parents don't seem to be providing and assisting with organizing that sounds like something OP can do.", "NTA. It sounds like your home wouldn't be best for Paula or for you. The situation you and your] aren't imagined isn't what!s going to happen, Paula's needs have increased, and you have to be able to provide for your family and stay sane. You can't help Paula or your family if you aren't healthy, both mentally and physically. Make plans to pay back the down payment and let your parents know that you won't be able to take her in.", "NTA but you need to get a loan to pay them back when you tell them. They are going to need that money and not a payment plan.", "NTA your parents are.  If they are so concerned for her they need to plan the hard things out for their child and not just put it on another child.", "NTA\nYou meant well but didn't anticipate her decline. You also likely didn't know enough at the time you agreed to research what help/resources were available in your state and instead relied on her parents/caregiver assurances that help was available. They were incorrect and are not accepting that you can not give her the care she needs. In fact, she would likely be neglected if her needs outweigh your skills/abilities, not intentionally, of course. I'm sure you'd do the best you could. My point is that she needs more.\n\nYou'd also be wring not to consider how this will impact your kids. They and your spouse HAVE to come first.\n\nI'm sorry your parents are blind to her high level of needs and so afraid of facilities. There are good ones out there, and with visits from family, it can often be the best plan for good care.", "NTA", "This situation needs the intervention of a social worker and benefits advocate. Everyone needs to sit down and go over assets and benefits. If what they promised does not add up, you need to inform them now that you can't be your sisters long term care taker. \n\nHaving an adult dependent with downs is an extraordinarily difficult task. It takes serious care, patience and money. \n\nPersonally I don't think you should have agreed to it. I think the temptation of being able to buy a home clouded your judgement. It's better you unravel this mess now.", "You agreed to take your sister on on the understanding that they would provide financial assistance that would make it possible for you to take care of your sister.  life insurance, SDDI (whatever that is!) and so on.\n\nBUt.... the reality is that they haven't really done anything beyond providing money for the down payment for your house.  The rest of the money will either be insuffficent or will come too late to matter. You will be in a nightmarish situation, and sending your sister to a group home would actually be the best thing for her.  She would have people there actually trained and capable of taking care of her.\n\nReturn the money they provided for the house down payment, and tell your parents that you are simply not able to take car of your sister when they're gone.  This is true.  You can try to keep your word... but you know this won't work.  You are NTA for admitting that you are unable to do this.  Your parents did rather mislead you into thinking this would be doable by promising financial assistance from them and the government... which they can't deliver on, either in time or at all.", "ESH\n\nYou're the closest to be doing what the priority should be: figuring out, planning for, and executing what would be best for PAULA. \n\nIt sounds like the best thing would be to get her some proper care, in this case I would say a group home. I know that's not what your \\*parents\\* want, but where would PAULA be happiest and healthiest? I believe she would be best off in a place where she is being cared for in a structured setting designed for and staffed by people who are trained to handle her disabilities. You had the best intentions when you agreed to the plan with your parents, but you are in over your head, and the person who will see the brunt of that is Paula. \n\nWork out a repayment plan with your parents, and all of you start looking into what needs to be done to transition Paula into better care. Your parents can visit all they like, and possibly still have her for visits or day trips or even short stays at home. It is better for this transition to happen now than when your parents get less physically able to work with her, and DEFINITELY better than when your parents are gone, when Paula will already have a challenge to adjust to them not being there. \n\nI have personal experience in this area. My sister does not have Downs, but she has many physical and mental health challenges, and has lived in group homes for decades. We are very involved in her life, this was not a \"shovel her off and dust our hands\" situation. It was best FOR HER. It was very difficult for my parents, but best for my sister. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA. The terms have changed. I do think you should try to repay the money loaned from your parents or put it in trust for your sister. \n\nYou and your sister need to have a sit down with your parents about Paula's care. It's going to be a difficult conversation, but it's so necessary. Financial planning and their will need to be set up for this. You and your sister need to understand what services she currently has and what financial assistance will be available.\n\nWe're starting to have some of these conversations concerning my sibling with autism who needs additional support. There are some independent living facilities for those with disabilities. My sibling does live in one with a lot of supports, but sibling is happy and enjoys living there. They have some meals provided and do a weekly shopping trip to the grocery store by bus for the residents.\n\nIndependent living (for seniors) might also be an option once she starts to age. Don't wait until your parents are in decline to start this process.\n\nThere's a Facebook group called sibnet that is for adults who have siblings with disabilities. There's a wealth of knowledge in the group and other's stories can be really helpful to try to navigate these issues with your own family.", "As long as you repay the money before Paula needs it, you are NTA. Your parents lied to you. There is no money, no funding, and she probably would be better in a group facility where she could have friends and activities suited to her development.", "ESH you need to repay the money you took as a down payment, figure out a payment plan and start repaying it now. Your parents are panicking and honestly I've seen this so many times in my career\n People seem to think the resources will be there or some hero will come out of the woodwork. I would suggest you get a 3rd party such as a counselor or social worker to help you talk to your parents or Paula will end up wherever there's room. I knew one case where a special needs young adult  ended up stranded in the hospital for months because her caregiver had died and there were no openings in the facilities. They need to start looking now and your sister had the right idea to find somewhere close so she can visit and oversee her care.", "NTA.  This is certainly a problem. Personally I think the responsibility for Paula rests strictly on your parent\u2018s shoulders.  Begin making regular payments on that loan, with interest, immediately. Do not feel guilty about being unwilling or unable to take Paula into your home.  Even though Paula is your sister, it is not fair for your parents to expect you to take her in especially if she is disruptive or needs more care than you can provide for her.  It\u2019s unfortunate you accepted than loan because they will continue to guilt trip you until the end of their lives probably even long after it is repaid.  Make it clear to them what your plan is and follow through with it.  My heart goes out to you and Paula.", "Unfortunately, YWBTA if you decline without a full repayment of the down payment. \n\nA deal was struck, and you accepted.

But once you accepted the down payment, you obligated yourself to the agreement.", "YWNBTA So from the little I know, people with Downs were regularly institutionalized from birth, until relatively recently and probably within your parents\u2019 memory. Unsurprisingly, they started living decades longer, with fulfilled lives, once children with Downs weren\u2019t routinely institutionalized. \n\nThat may explain your parents\u2019 fears about arranging for you sister to live in a group home, but it doesn\u2019t recuse them of making a realistic plan for her care.
