On top of that, you have three young kids. You obviously can't care for your sister, and that is understandable. Chances are, she'd have a better quality of life in a home where she's given the professional care she clearly needs.\n\nHOWEVER, you absolutely would be the asshole if you did not start making payments to pay off that downpayment money you accepted immediately.\n\nETA: Yes, to be clear, you also need to be completely upfront with your parents and nip this in the bud right now. They need to know that you will not be taking in your sister so they can figure out how to best move forward. And they seem completely oblivious as to how these things work, so I HIGHLY recommend you help get them in touch with legal help to navigate their plans for her future care. Leaving her an inheritance, for example, could really be problematic when it comes to her assistance. \n\nA decent care home will have a long waiting list. They seem to think they can just wait until their health declines then deal with it then, but by then it could be too late. You mentioned reaching out to someone at a local nonprofit who helped, try getting some assistance in figuring out the best plan for your sister's long-term care, someone who is familiar with how things work in your state and what her best options are for homes is the best thing you could do for your sister.", "NTA but start a repayment schedule for that money they gave you. And encourage them to get going on their planning for Paula's future. She should be getting home services asap to relieve them of some of the burden.", "\"You promised that there would be supports in place if I took her, and you have not done your part. Without those supports, it's not possible for me to take her in. There's no point in discussing it, because it is simply not possible. But I do care about Paula, so I'm willing to have the conversation *after* you do your part. I'm going to give you a list of things you *must* do and once you have done everything on the list, we can revisit the conversation.\" And then give them a list with everything you've mentioned here, plus anything else you think would be necessary... I'd include something about increasing her opportunities for regular social interactions\n\nNTA. Planning for Paula's future is difficult and scary. I totally get why your parents are reluctant to do so, especially if they've already discounted some of the viable options. They have a nearly overwhelming amount of work in front of them, and they are likely to feel extremely anxious because there aren't \"good\" options, only \"potentially workable\" ones.\n\nIt's much, much easier if they tell themselves that \"OP will take care of it\" and let themselves off the hook. After all, even if they know it isn't realistic, they can pretend that you will magically figure everything out.\n\nBut that is not fair of them. They're breaking their promise to you, and they are failing Paula. And not only failing her in the future, they're failing her in the present too: the stuff you described with her regressing? That is a clear sign of something being very wrong. (My first instinct is to guess depression, possibly related to isolation. Obviously, I don't know Paula, but my organization works with developmentally disabled adults and our stats show that there has been a marked increase in anxiety and depression due to COVID-related disruptions)", "I have a child that may never be able to live on his own. If he can't I'm going to find an assisted living facility or something so he'll be safe when I can't care for him anymore.  The only thing I plan on asking my other kids to do is step in if, God forbid,  something happens and hrs getting abused or something like that. However you did accept the money so you need to pay it back.", "No NTA. If you can\u2019t do it, you can\u2019t do it. You should, however, return the down payment money as soon as you are able because that money was intended for her care.", "I can speak from a position of knowledge as I have an adult disabled son (not Down syndrome, but profoundly disabled).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour parents have fallen into the trap of failing to plan for the care of Paula by assuming that she would always be cared for by family.  This is unfair to family members and also unfair to Paula.  Exhibit 1: What happens if/when all siblings predecease Paula?  Not likely since people with Down syndrome often have heart problems and die fairly young, but it could happen.  \n\n\nI'll tell you what we did with our son.  We went to court and got named as his guardians (in some states they are called conservators) when he turned 18 so that we would still be able to speak for him even though he was an adult.  Then, as soon as he aged out of school at 22, we placed him in a group home.  This was paid for by the county (or maybe the state, I don't recall).  He also started receiving SSI benefits.  Additionally, we made sure that he attended a day program so he wasn't just sitting around all day.  We stayed involved in his life by having him come home to stay with us every other weekend.  I became his \"representative payee\" and manage his SSI benefits.  We have since added our son's elder brother as a third guardian, and he will take over management in a few years as we are getting old.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou could do the same for Paula.  Once you have taken her in and get named as her guardian/conservator, then YOU are in control and your parents no longer have a say.  To suggest that if she is placed in a home she will \"die\" is ludicrous.  (I will say, though, that she will have a harder time adjusting than if she had been placed at 22 instead of at 40.  But it's still better than placing her at 65, which would be a disaster.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are NTA.  Your parents are also NTA, but many people in their position are just in denial about their disabled children and cannot bring themselves to see institutional placement as anything other than \"abandonment.\"", "Start a repayment plan that pays it \"back\" to Paula's trust.", "NTA. I understand your parents strong desire to keep Paula with family when they're unable to care for her... I have a T21 kid so I REALLY understand. Their terms were wonderful but if they aren't following through that's an issue. \n\nYou (and every other human) have the right to change your mind. Paula has a higher risk of developing dementia or Alzheimer's so I truly hope she's being evaluated appropriately. Good luck!", "Info has Paula been assessed for dementia which sadly can start to develop in people with Downs Syndrome when they are quite young. Depression should also be ruled out.", "YWBTA to not start paying back the down payment money now. But you are NTA to realize your sister needs more care than you are able to provide.", "One -you should have not taken the money. \nTwo- best option is a group home through an agency. They will take care of her and supply her with all her needs. They will take 70% of her monthly income from SSI or SSD. Obviously this is not enough to cover 24 hour care which is why many of these agencies are state funded. The rest of her money will go towards co-pays, clothing, spending money, and outings. Obviously say she doesn\u2019t have enough for new clothes the agency will pick up the cost. They are taken care of, granted it will never be as good as their own parents.  Unfortunately, this is the path for most DDD individuals. No one can offer 24 hour care like their parents and as they age their medical needs become me extensive.", "NTA, but pay the money back as soon as you can. \n\nCaring for someone with problems like this is difficult. I imagine you feel badly about not being able to help your sister, which I understand, but you have a family and that family comes first.\n\nWe had a similar situation when my MIL proposed living with each of her four kids (one of whom is my husband) for 3 mos each out of the year. I told my husband we could not do that; we had two kids in school at the time, and I was not prepared to take care of someone else. This was not a matter of not caring about my MIL; her proposal was simply not feasible for various reasons, mostly the state of her health.\n\nYour parents are hurting both themselves and Paula by their refusal to make any changes or plans. I hope you can convince them to start making plans, maybe tell them what the non-profit told you -- although I fully expect they'd find a way to deny or deflect.\n\nGood luck.", "As a parent of a disabled child who will never live independently - NTA. Absolutely NTA. Your parents are for trying to make you responsible for the care of your sibling. I understand so well their terror and why they want this so badly, but Paula is NOT your responsibility. Pay them back as quickly as possible and find alternative appropriate care for her.", "NTA\n\nYou were mislead because your parents wanted you to say yes no matter what. This was an unfair deal and they know it.\n\nIf I were you, that down payment should just go back towards your sister's care when your parents pass. That way no one can say you took the money and ran. It will be used as intended for Paula.", "NTA. Your parents put you on the spot. You were promised resources to assist you with caring for your sister, resources needed to care for her. They are not fulfilling their end of the bargain, but expect you to fulfill yours. I\u2019d tell them that they have two years to figure out all of the resources promised, or you\u2019ll be paying back the money and you\u2019ll make sure Paula is in safe home where she\u2019s cared for.", "The situation changed, but you gotta start re-paying that money so they can figure out something. at this point NTA but... it's close. You should have done your research initially!!!! I don't think your parents are free of blame either, and one could argue they misled you, but it's also possible at the time they weren't lying so... But you gotta get out of this and make things right on the money.", "NTA, the situation changed and parents majorly dropped the ball on both maintaining their part of the bargain and taking steps to secure Paula's future. \n\nThat said, be prepared to work out a repayment plan for money received, ideally in the form of a care fund for Paula.  She needs help the parents don't seem to be providing and assisting with organizing that sounds like something OP can do.", "NTA. It sounds like your home wouldn't be best for Paula or for you. The situation you and your] aren't imagined isn't what!s going to happen, Paula's needs have increased, and you have to be able to provide for your family and stay sane. You can't help Paula or your family if you aren't healthy, both mentally and physically. Make plans to pay back the down payment and let your parents know that you won't be able to take her in.", "NTA but you need to get a loan to pay them back when you tell them. They are going to need that money and not a payment plan.", "NTA your parents are.  If they are so concerned for her they need to plan the hard things out for their child and not just put it on another child.", "NTA\nYou meant well but didn't anticipate her decline. You also likely didn't know enough at the time you agreed to research what help/resources were available in your state and instead relied on her parents/caregiver assurances that help was available. They were incorrect and are not accepting that you can not give her the care she needs. In fact, she would likely be neglected if her needs outweigh your skills/abilities, not intentionally, of course. I'm sure you'd do the best you could. My point is that she needs more.\n\nYou'd also be wring not to consider how this will impact your kids. They and your spouse HAVE to come first.\n\nI'm sorry your parents are blind to her high level of needs and so afraid of facilities. There are good ones out there, and with visits from family, it can often be the best plan for good care.", "NTA", "This situation needs the intervention of a social worker and benefits advocate. Everyone needs to sit down and go over assets and benefits. If what they promised does not add up, you need to inform them now that you can't be your sisters long term care taker. \n\nHaving an adult dependent with downs is an extraordinarily difficult task. It takes serious care, patience and money. \n\nPersonally I don't think you should have agreed to it. I think the temptation of being able to buy a home clouded your judgement. It's better you unravel this mess now.", "You agreed to take your sister on on the understanding that they would provide financial assistance that would make it possible for you to take care of your sister.  life insurance, SDDI (whatever that is!) and so on.\n\nBUt.... the reality is that they haven't really done anything beyond providing money for the down payment for your house.  The rest of the money will either be insuffficent or will come too late to matter. You will be in a nightmarish situation, and sending your sister to a group home would actually be the best thing for her.  She would have people there actually trained and capable of taking care of her.\n\nReturn the money they provided for the house down payment, and tell your parents that you are simply not able to take car of your sister when they're gone.  This is true.  You can try to keep your word... but you know this won't work.  You are NTA for admitting that you are unable to do this.  Your parents did rather mislead you into thinking this would be doable by promising financial assistance from them and the government... which they can't deliver on, either in time or at all.", "ESH\n\nYou're the closest to be doing what the priority should be: figuring out, planning for, and executing what would be best for PAULA. \n\nIt sounds like the best thing would be to get her some proper care, in this case I would say a group home. I know that's not what your \\*parents\\* want, but where would PAULA be happiest and healthiest? I believe she would be best off in a place where she is being cared for in a structured setting designed for and staffed by people who are trained to handle her disabilities. You had the best intentions when you agreed to the plan with your parents, but you are in over your head, and the person who will see the brunt of that is Paula. \n\nWork out a repayment plan with your parents, and all of you start looking into what needs to be done to transition Paula into better care. Your parents can visit all they like, and possibly still have her for visits or day trips or even short stays at home. It is better for this transition to happen now than when your parents get less physically able to work with her, and DEFINITELY better than when your parents are gone, when Paula will already have a challenge to adjust to them not being there. \n\nI have personal experience in this area. My sister does not have Downs, but she has many physical and mental health challenges, and has lived in group homes for decades. We are very involved in her life, this was not a \"shovel her off and dust our hands\" situation. It was best FOR HER. It was very difficult for my parents, but best for my sister. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA. The terms have changed. I do think you should try to repay the money loaned from your parents or put it in trust for your sister. \n\nYou and your sister need to have a sit down with your parents about Paula's care. It's going to be a difficult conversation, but it's so necessary. Financial planning and their will need to be set up for this. You and your sister need to understand what services she currently has and what financial assistance will be available.\n\nWe're starting to have some of these conversations concerning my sibling with autism who needs additional support. There are some independent living facilities for those with disabilities. My sibling does live in one with a lot of supports, but sibling is happy and enjoys living there. They have some meals provided and do a weekly shopping trip to the grocery store by bus for the residents.\n\nIndependent living (for seniors) might also be an option once she starts to age. Don't wait until your parents are in decline to start this process.\n\nThere's a Facebook group called sibnet that is for adults who have siblings with disabilities. There's a wealth of knowledge in the group and other's stories can be really helpful to try to navigate these issues with your own family.", "As long as you repay the money before Paula needs it, you are NTA. Your parents lied to you. There is no money, no funding, and she probably would be better in a group facility where she could have friends and activities suited to her development.", "ESH you need to repay the money you took as a down payment, figure out a payment plan and start repaying it now. Your parents are panicking and honestly I've seen this so many times in my career\n People seem to think the resources will be there or some hero will come out of the woodwork. I would suggest you get a 3rd party such as a counselor or social worker to help you talk to your parents or Paula will end up wherever there's room. I knew one case where a special needs young adult  ended up stranded in the hospital for months because her caregiver had died and there were no openings in the facilities. They need to start looking now and your sister had the right idea to find somewhere close so she can visit and oversee her care.", "NTA.  This is certainly a problem. Personally I think the responsibility for Paula rests strictly on your parent\u2018s shoulders.  Begin making regular payments on that loan, with interest, immediately. Do not feel guilty about being unwilling or unable to take Paula into your home.  Even though Paula is your sister, it is not fair for your parents to expect you to take her in especially if she is disruptive or needs more care than you can provide for her.  It\u2019s unfortunate you accepted than loan because they will continue to guilt trip you until the end of their lives probably even long after it is repaid.  Make it clear to them what your plan is and follow through with it.  My heart goes out to you and Paula.", "Unfortunately, YWBTA if you decline without a full repayment of the down payment. \n\nA deal was struck, and you accepted.

But once you accepted the down payment, you obligated yourself to the agreement.", "YWNBTA So from the little I know, people with Downs were regularly institutionalized from birth, until relatively recently and probably within your parents\u2019 memory. Unsurprisingly, they started living decades longer, with fulfilled lives, once children with Downs weren\u2019t routinely institutionalized. \n\nThat may explain your parents\u2019 fears about arranging for you sister to live in a group home, but it doesn\u2019t recuse them of making a realistic plan for her care.

If she's constantly with her parents, I have to wonder if they are adequately providing socialization outside the home, as well. She may have Down syndrome, but she's also capable of understanding her situation, and I'd be worried if they are letting her be independent where she is capable of it or not. Dementia would be the worst case scenario, but unfortunately possible", "From my experience don't wait for a crisis to start changing living/care arrangements. I worked with special needs who have family involvement to various degrees. One of the blokes goes home every weekend which works well. His mum gets a break during the week and he is settled into a second home and gets the social stimulation of housemates and staff. Now his mum is getting older the visits are shorter and he is happy enough if she is too poorly to see him that he stays put and she phones him. Much kinder than having a shock of say a death or hospital admission and having to deal with a new living situation on top of it. This is in the UK but the care is flexible with parents/siblings taking them home for a few weeks here and there and away on holidays. Just because they are not living at home does not mean every effort will be made to help involve them in family life, doesn't have to be one or the other.", "OP took thousands of dollars from those parents in exchange for agreeing to provide housing for that child.

My brothers and I all had an agreement with our mother that when she couldn\u2019t care for her anymore we would put our sister in a home. While my mother was saddened she understood that we were not her parents and we had our own lives to live. \n\nYour parents are major AH for trying to force you to do this, THEY are her parents and not you, them trying to force her onto your family is cruel.

Even temporarily, because that can too easily become long term as your parents age - and then Medicaid will see you as the caregivers and won\u2019t make a place for Paula in their underfunded overcrowded system. I made that mistake with my sister.\n\nOne day your parents will die suddenly or be physically unable to care for her, with no proven viable alternative (ie you, legitimately claiming no time since you work snd no funds because kids!), and Paula will then get put as an emergency placement into the Medicaid housing system. It is sad that this did not get set up starting 20 years ago so Paula could  get accustomed to a group home, make friends, have activities and a routine.", "NTA. You took and accepted offer. That benefitted both parties. Your parents didn't follow thru on their end. Everything has changed. All bets are off. Give them back the money when you can. Feel bad yes but not your fault.", "NTA. Sounds like your parents are intending to force you to take Paula, by making sure there is nowhere else for her to go.

If you stop and look back you will find this was true most of your life. The base situation has changed and you can no longer do it. \n\nLet them tantrum. It is their responsibility and she needs to be put in a facility that can care for her better. They are trying to manipulate you because they are getting older.

I spent many years working with individuals (children and adults) who are developmentally disabled. I am also in a bit of a similar situation with my own SIL who is developmentally disabled and whose parents (my ILs) have made zero plans for.   \n\n\nIt is completely unrealistic for your parents to expect that you or your other sibling will be able to take care of Paula. Paula has extensive needs. In addition, individuals with Down's syndrome have a high incidence of early-onset dementia (it's possible that the behavior changes occurring are the result of that). It is not possible for you and your immediate family to provide the level of care that Paula needs and will need in the future. \n\nIn addition, you were misled as to what the situation would be going forward and what level of assistance you would have to help with Paula. \n\nFirst thing you need to do is sit down with your parents and explain all this. Be firm, be clear. You cannot provide the level of care Paula needs. It is not physically possible for you to do assuming you and your spouse have kids, jobs, etc. \n\nSecond, don't panic. Learn about what services are available and, mostly importantly, learn about how your state handles \"crisis situations.\" In my home state, while waiting lists for group homes and services are long under normal circumstances, instances where parents are no longer able to care for a disabled adult child move someone up quite rapidly on the waiting list. You need to look into this for the state in which Paula resides (not where you live). Most likely, she's is already getting some sort of services, even basic case management, and that means she's known by the DD agency in the state. When a \"crisis\" happens (parents die, they aren't able to physically care for her), there are generally other services that kick in. \n\nWhat we did with my ILs was sit down and have a very direct conversation about this. SO and I were clear that we could NOT, under any circumstances, have my disabled SIL live with us. Therefore, they had two options - they could either make plans now and find a group home that worked for her needs OR they could wait until a crisis occurred and SIL would become a ward of the state and the state would handle her care and placement. \n\nIn my case, my ILs have still made no plans. They are in poor health and my SIL still lives in their house. My SO and are prepared to tell the state we are unable to take her when the time comes because we don't have the ability to care for her. We remind my ILs of this every so often and are still hoping that they will at least live long enough to see her transition into a group home, but we also know it will very likely be the case that we have to tell the state to place her somewhere, which may not be the nicest placement. \n\nIt's an unfortunate situation and I wish our country had a better system set up for these cases, but aging parents also need to recognize that they can't pawn off care on other siblings in these instances. It's just not realistic.", "NTA with a few conditions.\n\nHave convo with your parents ASAP. They will freak out but don't back down. It sounds like they aren't preparing you or your sister with the support either of you need. That's really sad and scary. The sooner they have notice the better prepared they can be to make changes.

It's super important though.", "NTA\n\nYour family and mine sound the same ... Your parents want everything to work out and refuse to except reality they make up a best case scenario and run with it as the truth and the definate because they feel they need that dream BUT that doesn't help with reality. \n\nYou need to have a real talk with them be honest about what you have found out, and explain that it changes everything. That you will not be able to afford her care and that it would be far worse with you then in a home.\nThat you will be paying back the downpayment ASAP\n( You may need to refinance your home early if they demand the money now... Which sucks BUT they did give you the money conditionally and yes they lied/ were wrong, but you could have looked into it before accepting as well)\n\nIf you don't feel you can have this discussion without them talking over you then write an email / FB message or text.\n\nThe truth hurts but they can't plan for reality until they know", "NTA, you (already know) need to give the money back though", "NTA my son has multiple disabilities. He will never be capable of living alone. He will have to go into a group home or medical facility at some point. It's not what I want but it is best for him long term. I can't be selfish. I have to do what is best for him. He's been on the waiting list for the DD Waiver since he was 8, nine years. There were over ten thousand people ahead of him. The only reason he's been offered a waiver now is because of Covid, they're clearing the list. Even with the waiver it will be years before they'll have an opening in a safe facility or home. I hope to be able to transition him before I'm unable to care for him. \n\nIt is your parents' responsibility to ensure your sister is provided for. They should have signed her up for waivers and support years ago. They can, and should, put her on the waiting lists now. If your sister has Medicaid they already have access to home health aides, maybe nursing, to assist in her care. They just have to ask for an evaluation. There are adult day programs that can provide your sister with activities and help her make new friends.

Knowing that, you should probably begin your groundwork right away. Set up an appointment with an estate planning attorney that has experience in adults with disabilities.  Check into and visit some group homes and facilities, find out financial terms and waiting list times. Find out how much is in the life insurance. See about obtaining guardianship. It's good of you to plan to repay the $, but you may yet incur expenses in this process.  Also, your parents may have health issues of their own requiring them to spend down before being eligible for help.

She turns 65 this year.", "Definitely good advice. On the flip side, a friend of mine \"Dee\" is one of six children. The oldest, John, had severe mental disabilities and was never able to live on his own. For YEARS, the other five kids BEGGED their parents to transition John to a group home so the transition could be done gradually and easily while her parents were still alive and in good health. They refused, continually coming up with one excuse or another, with the hope that one of the other five kids would take him in eventually.\n\nThe reality was Dee had a spouse who was ill and required a lot of her time and attention and among the other four siblings there were health, family and addiction issues which would make them all unsuitable caregivers for John. But, her parents continued to ignore the elephant in the room until when, both in their 80's, they died within six months of each other, leaving John no where to go.\n\nIt was UGLY. Basically Dee had to find John emergency housing and take him from the only home he'd ever known his ENTIRE LIFE. It was awful. John was so miserable, agitated and depressed, that dealing with all his issues was another full time job for Dee beyond her own job and caring for her husband. I wouldn't wish what Dee went through on my worst enemy. The saddest part is ALL of it could have been avoided with prior planning on her parents' part and coming to terms with the fact that John was likely to outlive them.\n\nSadly, John passed about 2 years later. We all feel that the decline in his health was accelerated by all the upheaval in the wake of his parents' passing.\n\nOP ABSOLUTELY has to address all this NOW so Paula doesn't end up in a similar situation because there are no winners when things aren't planned out in advance and for all contingencies.", "I want to upvote this 100 times.

The older you get the harder it gets to adjust to change. Often old people move to a home because it becomes impossible to live independently (often after a long hospital stay). At that stage they have a very hard time getting used to the routines at their new home, making contacts/friends there and their health and mental capacity decline rapidly. If they move in there while still mostly independent they can slowly adjust while still doing a lot of care (bathing, clothing, etc) themselves and by the time they need extra help it's less jarring. They are still active enough (mentally and physically) to form new relationships and will feel more comfortable. Also it will be their decision and they can actively navigate the new situation in contrast to it being the only choice. A mental disability usually makes it even harder to adjust in the first place so adjusting to the changes at an age that makes it hard for everyone is going to be a challenge.", "My special needs kid is 9.
