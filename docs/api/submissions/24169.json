The whole weekend i was helping her and lived only for her sporting event. Helped with transporting her, fixing her bike, applying oil to the chain etc. Was on the move 14 hours on saturday, being supportive etc. She acts like it did not happen. I get what you are saying but to me it seems odd that everything is thrown out the window as soon as i say \"no\" just once. Specially after a weekend like this where i did everything to her, didn't go to my yearly family reunion for this sports event she had trained for a year. Did it gladly, never mentioned my contribution to her until she said i never do anything for her and only others.\n\nThanks for your reply.", "That is unreasonable.

I.e, safewords to end the argument NOW, for example \"pause\", \"redo\" etc. If those are said we can hug and kiss etc as if nothing happened so we don't forget we love eachother. We can finish the argument later. She has never used any of those safewords. I always beg of her to just argue 1 day and not waste our lives with arguments over tiny little things that don't matter in years to come.

Get 2 apologies.  No fewer.", "NTA - you are right that it is unreasonable for her to expect YOU to pause your work.  This is your JOB.   Her retaliation of leaving you at work without a ride certainly caused you a lot more time than she would have lost by using another computer (though I like how you choose to look on the good side of renting a car).

Forcing you off your computer to save herself 5-10 minutes is incredibly disrespectful to you, your time, and your own work.\n\nIt's also a massive red flag that she blocked you on everything (is she 34 or 16?), then hate bombed you, silent treatmented you, and abandoned you to find your own way home without warning.\n\nY'all might need to consider having clearer boundaries when you're working, and also work on her anger management/communication skills - spouting insults and hate at your partner over any disagreement is toxic.\n\nEdit: After reading some of your comments OP, I've gotta say - GF has some real issues with controlling herself and being mindful of hurting you. If every argument is blown out of proportion to the point she is throwing these tantrums, insulting you, leaving you without transport, demanding any money she's spent on you be paid back, and threatening to end the relationship, well... those are some major issues and not healthy for either of you - abuse isn't always physical or constant. I'd highly recommend talking through these behaviours with her when you're both in a good space and consider therapy and/or couples therapy to work on the way she reacts to and handles disagreements. Best of luck!", "NTA she is overreacting", "And what would happen if your manager walks by and you are sitting there staring off into space with your gf on your computer?

Maybe working together is not good for this relationship. Maybe she is seeing you go above and beyond for other people and is feeling sad or jealous.

My husband told me my arguing wasn't constructive at all, and he had several rules we had to follow. Pause was one of them. We would get back to it when I wasn't so angry.", "good job trivializing a person's attempt at moving on from a traumatic history. Jesus christ think outside yourself for just a moment.", "Well, pause actually always end the argument anyway. \nOtherwise the rules and all this other things are mostly from the videos/articles she sends me about differences in a relationships and arguments etc.", "Bruh. She's 34 and acting like this? She's THURTY FOUR this behavior would be embarrassing for a 14 year old. Does she regularly react to disagreements like this bc if so seriously rethink your situation. NTA shes acting ridiculous and disrespecting your job.", "Dude. Get out of this relationship immediately. Every time you add to the story in a comment it gets worse.", "Buddy, I think you know you need to leave her. This doesn't sound like a healthy relationship.", "Run for the hills my friend, and don't look back.", "I don't get why you tolerate this, good sex only? What do you get from her", "Reading this comment chain, it's called emotional and financial abuse. Get out, and don't agree to any kind of debt.", "Ok i take back my previous reply to one of your comments. She's definitely emotionally abusive and this isn't good for you. This is not a healthy relationship at all and isn't the sort of thing that couples therapy can fix. She's openly taking advantage of you. why are you still together?", "Run", " But that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying lol working with a SO makes things more complicated. Yes if she was just a coworker it might tick her off but there wouldn\u2019t be repercussions at home. You cannot fully separate your home and work lives when you are this entertwined. On paper, yes it shouldn\u2019t be an issue, but it clearly is.", "You two are not compatible in the slightest from the little one reads here", "Sounds like there might be resentment if you just say pause and don\u2019t actually resolve the conflict. Pausing is good if it allows both of you to calm down but never resolving it is a bad idea", "I understand what you are saying, but my question is: why does OP suck? Because he didn't pick up on something that's bothering gf? Why are you making that assumption? Why do you rule ESH based on an assumption?", "Because it would have been a nice thing to do for his GF and it wouldn\u2019t have ruined his day! So as I said \u2018he KINDA sucks\u2019 for this."]}
