We can finish the argument later. She has never used any of those safewords.

Forcing you off your computer to save herself 5-10 minutes is incredibly disrespectful to you, your time, and your own work.\n\nIt's also a massive red flag that she blocked you on everything (is she 34 or 16?), then hate bombed you, silent treatmented you, and abandoned you to find your own way home without warning.\n\nY'all might need to consider having clearer boundaries when you're working, and also work on her anger management/communication skills - spouting insults and hate at your partner over any disagreement is toxic.\n\nEdit: After reading some of your comments OP, I've gotta say - GF has some real issues with controlling herself and being mindful of hurting you. If every argument is blown out of proportion to the point she is throwing these tantrums, insulting you, leaving you without transport, demanding any money she's spent on you be paid back, and threatening to end the relationship, well... those are some major issues and not healthy for either of you - abuse isn't always physical or constant.

If I get roasted for anything it\u2019s this: apologizing when you don\u2019t feel like you did anything wrong can go a long way, choose your words and apologize in that something you did really hurt her even if you didn\u2019t intend to do as such, but not necessarily for what you did itself (\u201cI\u2019m sorry if the way I handled the situation hurt you but I was trying to get through a stressful period at work, I thought using the other computer was a reasonable compromise\u201d).

Admitting he was wrong when he wasn't), AND she expects him to fix her having an issue with it in the first place so it doesn't happen again. Like in her mind, it's not her issue. She has an issue with it, and therefore that makes it his issue to fix. I'd run the fuck away if I were OP cause that would be exhausting to marry.

We can ride home in silence.", "Thanks for the reply, hard to swallow but i think i need to hea all perspectives.", "I did, she got way more mad. Said this post is the worst betreyal ever and nobody has ever done anything as bad to her.", "DO NOT get in a relationship. I beg for your future partner's mental health", "I love how this sub gets when a man isn't a complete doormat for his partner", "I wasn't dating for 2.5 years before that.", "Right? I did that shit in high school. NTA.", "[removed]", "A lot of people meet their partner at work. Most people are mature enough to act professional on the job anyway", "Thou shall have no others before me.", "NTA I read that she wants attention/validation. A common human need that we have to learn how and when to ask it if others and how and when to give it to ourselves. It sounds like she may be waaaaay over-asking for it from you. \n\nOnly you can change this situation, unfortunately. Arguing every day is NOT HEALTHY NOR NORMAL", "That\u2019s a pretty big red flag, OP. Disagreements happen in a relationship. Being able to handle them maturely is very, very important. I think in your position, I would be saying \u201cTherapy or we are done.\u201d", "Hmm. So the weekend that was so tailored to her needs ends abruptly, and in front of other people, when you use logic? Does she behave possessive of you in other ways at work?  Although, I\u2019m starting to agree she is a little immature and has Main Character Syndrome. \n\nHere\u2019s the question. If you had been alone in the department, with no one around to hear her get told, \u201cno\u201d , would she still be this upset?", "That sounds like you doing a lot for her, I don't see any examples of her reciprocating and doing things for you. Aka not exactly an equal relationship, you might have accidentally proven why she wigged out at work the one time you *didn't* do something for her (and very reasonably didn't, I might add).", "Yeah OP, read all that you typed again. Out loud if need be. It sounds like your relationship has gone lopsided. Its all great when you are showering HER with attention and fulfilling HER needs and goals. The second you put you own boundary/priorities down, waterworks, the cold shoulder, jealousy when you are merely kind to other co-workers. That's not healthy behavior on her part. NTA.", "No, no, no, no. Stop helping her with work matters with things she does not have access to.\n\nI am not sure what type of work you both do, but I am in charge of access requests for my department in my company (then the level above me approves and applies). I still had to do extra training on who can have what access and how the access and data must be handled. I have to retake PII and PHI courses annually, and I have to know the difference and who is eligible for what data even though there's someone higher than me actually granting the access. \n\nIf your company wanted or thinks she needed access to anything you have access to, they would have given it to her. If she has projects that she feels she can not complete without that information, she needs to follow your company's policy for requesting that information.\n\nMy fiance and I work for the same company but in different departments. I am at a higher level than him as I am in management. I could be fired for sharing the information I have access to, even with him, even if it is for work. \n\nCompanies all over have access structures, generally based on job descriptions or pay levels within the company.\n\nAnd NTA, if yalls work computers are like mine, yes, it is annoying as hell to sync, but you never interrupt a coworker for their desk computer when there's an available unassigned PC. Also, once she synced to it once she synced. It's better to do it sooner than later.", "You are reaching a bit far here. Supporting this just cause it \"sounds like\" something.", "So you wait 5 min so she doesn't have to wait 5 min? How does that make sense?", ">If you can't communicate with your s/o and going on Reddit to validate youself\n\nI don't see you giving all the wives who post here about their AH husbands a hard time? Why is it only a crime if a man posts about his GF to reddit?", "No, she would have found something else to blow out of proportion instead.", "Uhhhh, it IS a reach. Everything you\u2019ve said is just what you *think* is going on, despite being told was is *actually* going on. There was no \u201cfight\u201d here, just OPs gf being overly upset over something minor. OP takes full ownership of not letting his gf use the computer he was using, which is the only thing that started this and he\u2019s done nothing else. The only thing OP is \u201cblissfully ignorant\u201d to is their gf being crazy.", "How else can they demonise the man?", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", ">We met at work\n\nOof. Guess you\u2019ve never heard the expression \u201cdon\u2019t shit where you sync\u201d.", "> i'm alone in the cinemas parking lot with 2 tickets to Oppenheimer. She ran away again when blaming me for liking our new IT chick\n\nLmao come on dude, are you kidding? She's just jerking you around at this point.. that's not even remotely close to a reasonable reaction to telling her she couldn't use your computer.\n\nYou're at a place now where you need a friend or someone to knock a little sense into you and tell you to have some self-respect, grow a spine and start thinking straight. Is this the kind of person you want to be with? This is very emotionally abusive and by the way you talk and your other comments I don't think you deserve that, do you?", "You are being used as a doormat and abused apparently. Have some self respect and get away", "It's a work computer; OP would be stupid to have personal accounts or unprofessional communications on it.\n\nUnprofessional in the sense of like, emailing friends about silly stuff, not regular office chatter/banter", "See also: Don't get your honey where you get your money.", "what about dipping one's penis?", "You're being manipulated. She's trying to make you feel guilty for thinking what you're doing is more important than what she wanted to do.\n\nLook up emotional blackmail and see if your gf fits the description.", "You're probably NTA, but could this be the tip of a larger iceberg?\n\nYou said she makes lunch for you, and apparently takes you to and from work? (I couldn't really understand completely the timeline and where you were)\n\nMaybe she feels that she does more for you than you do for her? Again, it doesn't excuse the behavior. If she's just doing this on purpose to cause you trouble or manipulate you, then eventually you need to leave. \n\nHonestly seems strange that she'd ask you to interrupt vital work for no reason, then get so upset that she doesn't get over it for a whole day.", "There are certain regulatory compliance situations that can make any kind of shared account prohibitive.", "She has warned him this entire time", "See, this is a euphemism.", "What he's describing is literally her freezing him out, being passive aggressive and incredibly petty because she truly does not seem to know how to argue. Instead of actually discussing the issue she has and letting him put his side across, she's bringing him food so that she can purposefully ignore him while eating, leaving him stranded at work, refusing to eat food he made her and generally giving him the silent treatment. \n\nShe sucks.", "why are you assuming so much? Maybe other people can solve their probs rationally, a pause might be in order if the argument drags on forever and both parties need some time to cool off and talk about it more calmly at a later point instead of needlessly hurt each other because people are seeing red - 100% makes sense.", "I\u2019ve read a lot of the comments and more specifically your replies on this thread and I can say without doubt your girlfriend is manipulative and abusive. She is taking advantage of your kindness and her asking to use your computer was just a way to control you and since you didn\u2019t give in you are being punished to the point she expects you to cower down, it\u2019s a cycle so she can keep chipping away at you to manipulate you further. I guarantee if you try to end the relationship it will scare her and she will beg and she may even turn a new leaf, but it will only be temporary. This is the type of person that therapy can\u2019t fix, they know how to mask their true selves and can paint themselves as the victims. It really is a never ending cycle. I really suggest walking away, I hate telling someone online to leave their relationship, but I have been in your shoes and am currently in therapy for similar situations such as yours that I am trying to heal from. \n\nEmotional abuse, manipulation, financial abuse, hot and cold, ignoring you, blocking you, fighting for days, controlling you, accusations about coworkers\u2026 there\u2019s so many red flags I can\u2019t even keep count.", "It isn't a stretch. I have been straight up told by my ex after it was over that she would intentionally instigate fights, run away and ignore me and expect me to run after her because she wanted validation. She went to therapy and described her own behavior as abusive.\n\nOP's partner is abusive.", "Not only abuse, but violent abuse! As if being ignored or not driven home is anywhere the same as being physically attacked.", "About the pause, and her never bring the one to pause an argument. \nAnother way to see this is she feels her opinion or feelings are belittled when you want a pause, and she doesn't use the pause, herself, as she doesn't want to belittle you. In other words, when there is no argument going on, discuss he true feelings about pausing and softly ask her feelings when you decide to use it.", "I'd like to add in here that people,  including OP, are saying she doesn't know how to argue. I see it as she doesn't know how to communicate, period. She also doesn't know how to discuss anything where she must defend her opinion or listen to another person's opinion when it doesn't support hers. There are many ways to discuss disagreement instead of arguing even if either of you are upset. Discussion and open communication are key. Arguing doesn't truly solve anything. As for the ladies complementing his work... I'd say the gf is jealous. Perhaps, she doesn't get coworker compliments? Jealousy can be over many different things, not just the obvious.", "Yeah, she is absolutely the problem overall, I've not said otherwise, just this point about the arguing I don't really get", "I'm not assuming anything, I'm questioning what they said. Cooling off and taking about it later is *not* arguing though, that's discussing it rationally, which I would agree with, and substituently assume that's what they meant to say", "Add the tantrum by not eating a perfectly good meal and grabbing random stuff from the fridge, I did that when I was 9 at most, who is that childish", "I agree it's not healthy, but doesn't equating ignoring/manipulating someone to a physically violent relationship minimize the life threatening situation the latter has?", "He's listed all of the ways that she's bad at arguing right there in the post. She just doesn't do it. She punishes him because she doesn't know how to handle not being the main character, and it doesn't get resolved that way at all.", "Well we all know that this sub would cry abuse and accuse the man of communicating like a child if he didn't communicate and instead ran off to give silent treatment.", "Ah I knew this would happen. As soon as the post doesn't have an obvious path to vote the man an AH just accuse the man of leaving info out.", ">You didn't want to do something for her because it would be inconvenient to you.\n\nHorrible, unhealthy outlook. People do not exist to \"make their partner happy\" and OP does not have to cave to every unreasonable, self-serving whim she has. He is a human being with needs too, you know?\n\nUnlike how you might devalue yourself and define your life successes purely through how you can cater to your partner, he has personal aspirations at work and had something other than serving her on his mind. Why couldn't SHE be the good partner, sense his stress, and bring him a hot cocoa or something to cheer him up? Does everything in life have to revolve around the partner more prone to dramatics?", "Still NTA. You didn't share your real names nor the company where you work, so this is totally anonymous.\n\nThe only betrayal here is that she wanted to impede your work for a very slight convenience for her.", "I'm not trying to absolve anything. I'm trying to rationalize it. It's very rare for otherwise reasonable people to suddenly become unhinged.", ">He has not actually provided her side at all\n\nHurr Durr maybe if she actually communicated her side he would know. What's he meant to do? Invent his own reason as to why the GF is upset? No that's your job.", "It sounds like you need to stop trying to diagnose strangers off of a single 3rd party account of their behavior on the internet", "That is WILD because Ive dated many girls and the thought of any of them breaking my shit or trashing my home is like ZERO. Wtf? Lmao.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDawg you've had some shitty relationships and I think you need to hold yourself to a higher standard in your future ones.", "So why is it that this \"rationalization\" only seems to appear when the Gf/ wife/ woman is clearly the AH In the story? Very rarely is there ever a \"there's more going on here\" when the BF/ husband is at fault.", "Lmao so why can't GF communicate like an adult? Or is communication something that only BFs should do?", "No, I am not reaching. A lot of people are jumping to conclusions about her based on what it sounds like from what he says. Same thing. I just think there is more to the story than OP sees and even he says he could be missing something. He should be asking her why she feels it is a big deal or what it means to her instead of dismissing it as no big deal.", "It seems to me that she has been trying to communicate to him what her issues are but he dismisses them as nothing to be upset about because it doesn't fit his idea if what is a big deal.That is why she brings stuff up to him repeatedly as he isn't getting it and she is trying to get him to. He is meant to ask her if he doesn't know with an open mind and without minimizing or dismissing her.", "Yeah when its an AH bf/husband its usually \"abusive narcissistic AH!\" People assume the men are AHs because they want to be AHs. \n\nBut when wives/gfs are AHs, everybody breaks out the background stories and mental illnesses to create a situation where it isn't her fault.", "I agree, sometimes the real problem is buried and nothing can be solved until the true problem is dug up and dealt with. I it's like the teacher writing a note home that Jimmy didn't push attention in class, distracts everyone and refuses to read any assignment, and that's all the teacher will address even when the parents come in to discuss what to do. But, Jimmy's problem is he can't read at grade level. Until the root problem is thoroughly understood nothing will be solved", "Doesn't it ever... same to you! Moving out what the best thing that ever happened to me.", "What\u2019s wrong with watery eyes, huh? No I\u2019d never cry over that but some people are just criers. Doesn\u2019t make them bad ppl. Least, that\u2019s what Rosie Greer said.", "It can work dating a co worker, but you can't be with each other 24/7 like they are.  My husband and I were originally coworkers.  He was in another department and a few months after we started dating he got transferred to a different shift.  Which was fine.  After that we still worked at the same vegas casino, but in different departments and at different times.  Sometimes our shifts crossed over and even then it was promised we'd see each other.  It worked out fine because it wasn't like we were ALWAYS seeing each other.\nThese two are seemingly never apart.", "Also. I think it helps that y'all sound more mature than the gf. We all get butt hurt at some point even for something stupid, but she's way too old to be doing all she's doing to punish him. It sounds like it's about more than the computer and I feel they need to sit and talk if they want to stay together.", "Yeah that's the key.  You can live/work with someone but you still need space to be your own person. I've seen one exception and they have been together since 16, and they are together all the time. Work, home, etc. And they love it. I can't imagine having someone up my butt virtually 24/7 no matter how much I love them.", "This is true.  Which is funny bc hubs and I were 25 & 26 when we got together.  I realize age doesn't equal to maturity but looking back at the gfs age, I'm a little disappointed that she's 34.", "Generally no. Especially if you're still in your 20s. I feel that's still akin to a learning teenager. But mid 30s? Time to grow up ma'am. Smh", "Certainly. I can guarantee it's not the computer she's upset about, it's only the issue she chose to act out about. She's not communicating with OP and probably expects him to know and or pickup on whatever the real issue is. This isn't happening and it's causing her emotions to ramp up. \n\nTherapy is going to be the best bet for resolving this and salvaging the relationship. I agree that OP should end things if she refuses to engage in therapy. Otherwise, she will just continue to act out in negative ways until something triggers a crisis. Cheating is likely going to happen if it hasn't already."]}
