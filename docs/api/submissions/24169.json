She found a document and requested me to use my computer to check something ( i would have to pause my job, log out, she would log in, check the thing etc, about 5 minutes).\nI told her there is a computer next to mine which nobody is using and she can use that one. She then told me she never used it and it takes too long to sync( about 5-10 minutes).\nI told her i'm busy and she could be with me while waiting and that would be fun, we could talk and i could still finish my critical tasks while she is waiting for it to sync. Her eyes got watery and she walks away.\n\nI explained to her via chat how it came out \nbad but the idea still stands, why should i pause when there is a perfectly good computer next to me? AITA?\nShe blocked me on everything except my number and says vile things to me. I ask her to focus on moving on because it's such a small thing and she makes it out to be a life changing experience. \n\nOn lunch she asked me what i wanted and she brought it to me. I think all is well until she completely ignores me while we eat and when i'm finished and thank her/make small talk to get back to being gf and bf she tells me to go away. \nSidenote: 2 women from IT and HR come to me while im away from the table to thank me for my contribution in some ad clip for the company etc. They tell me good job and ask me to come see the clips after lunch.\n\nShe then blames me on being too good to others and not at all good to her ever etc.\n\nShe then left me at work when we had come together in the morning and made a plan she would drop me off at home and she would continue to go to her massage appointment.

She asks somethin from you at work and you deny all the time or something?", "NTA she's too old to be sulking. It isn't a good luck on a 34 year old.", "NTA\n\nShe left you at work, that's enough that I would end the relationship right there.", "YTA. It would have taken you five minutes. That's not much. But more than the time, you would have shown your girlfriend that you care and are glad to help her out. Pointing her to the unused computer that takes forever to load might be practical but it's also cold and dismissive. \n\nWhat to do? Admit it to her. Communicate.", "NTA, you\u2019re at work completing a job and that you are paid to do. She is able to ask you to wait 5 minutes (minimum) if everything goes smoothly for your work to be on pause yet she is not able to wait 5-10 minutes for her work? I understand her wanting to have you allow her to use your items however work is work and personal is personal and they must remain separated. I used to work with my boyfriend and it was hard to keep things separated and I would get upset but I was also in my late teens/early 20 (like 19-20).", "NTA ... Would she have expected the same from any other colleague and then proceeded to treat them the same way if refused? She is acting like an entitled spoiled brat and taking it way too far.", "So.. you were at work?\n\nFYI, it takes just as long to sync a new user account on your computer as an unused computer.\n\nI don\u2019t understand what she wants. It sounds very suspicious and just plain weird to expect you to pause your work and log out of your computer, which may disrupt things which are loading if you do any form of macro or processing - just for her to check something that she can do on any other computer.\n\nNTA from me if that\u2019s the whole story.", "NTA. Are you sure there isn\u2019t something else at play here? Seems a bit much for just the fact you asked her to log onto a different computer", "NTA but your gf is being one!

Your girlfriend needs to be able to better compartmentalise your working and your personal relationship. Your response re the computer was a very reasonable one. The silent treatment sucks and I wouldn't want to live with someone like that.", "Sounds like she is a psyco...NTA", "NTA\n\nYou were AT WORK.\n\nDang it.", "NTA, at least going by what you're telling. I don't want to assume anything, still I get the feeling that this is NOT entirely about the use of a different computer. \n\nWhy could she not go back to her own computer to look up the information?", "No, not at all, we just finished working together on a project we both got a lot of credit for and we help eachother a lot. She can't help me as much as i can help her( i have more access to things because of my role in the company being more versatile), but she's always happy to, same with me, always happy to be important and needed.", "I am glad to help her every day, with work or personal life. The whole weekend i was helping her and lived only for her sporting event. Helped with transporting her, fixing her bike, applying oil to the chain etc. Was on the move 14 hours on saturday, being supportive etc. She acts like it did not happen. I get what you are saying but to me it seems odd that everything is thrown out the window as soon as i say \"no\" just once. Specially after a weekend like this where i did everything to her, didn't go to my yearly family reunion for this sports event she had trained for a year. Did it gladly, never mentioned my contribution to her until she said i never do anything for her and only others.\n\nThanks for your reply.", "That is unreasonable. How does this show that he doesn't care about his gf? Did he make her go to the computer on different flowers? There was a computer right beside him that she could use. That's being unreasonable.", "I think she may have used OPs computer in the past, so it would be quicker? Still NTA though.", "As i am a man i'm sure i myself am missing something here, but does not seem like i am. She now has asked to stop this, after i agreed when she said we should end the relationship( she always goes there). We do have a lot of fun and she lifts me up and makes me feel so important etc, but then these little things happen and she fucks me up with words and tires me out with these arguments over little things that don't matter.", "In our defence we work on totally different projects and far from eachother mostly ever see on lunch. Big building and big company. I am always happy if we run together and we always seems to have fun times when we do. Different projects, different customers etc.", "Then NTA its a weird reaction for a small thing", "Correct, she has used in the past so it would have been quicker.", "Fair Enough. It still doesn't prevent workplace disagreements (or whatever you want to call what you had) from transferring into your home life.", "Probably not that much faster, considering how long mine takes to sync after I was on a one week vacation. \n\nRereading the post, her was extremely over the top. It actually creeps me out.", "Same with me as i have been a part in a violent relationship in the past where i got kicked and bitten etc i have made up some rules with this relationship. I.e, safewords to end the argument NOW, for example \"pause\", \"redo\" etc. If those are said we can hug and kiss etc as if nothing happened so we don't forget we love eachother. We can finish the argument later. She has never used any of those safewords. I always beg of her to just argue 1 day and not waste our lives with arguments over tiny little things that don't matter in years to come. She accept she does not know how to argue and needs help but when i ask her to stop her flame gets more fuel it seems."]}
