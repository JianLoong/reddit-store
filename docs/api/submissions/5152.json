Respect is a two-way street. Your GF has been body shaming you for a while and it\u2019s only natural that you reached your breaking point. See if she is up for an adult conversation about how her comments make you feel and how you didn\u2019t mean what you said but just reacted to her bullying.

Sorry, but you lost the moral high ground when you said that; it\u2019s what 12 year olds do. If she just kept being mean to you and calling you too skinny then you needed to stand up for yourself.

She shouldn\u2019t be making comments like that about your body in the first place, it\u2019s generally just not an okay thing to do to your partner.\n\nHowever, she\u2019s not wrong about the beauty standards thing. There\u2019s a lot of pressure on women in particular to be thin. It\u2019s likely that the comments she was making about you were a means of projecting her insecurities about her own body. It\u2019s easier for her to convince herself that you\u2019re too thin than it is for her to think that the reason you look \u201csmall\u201d is because she\u2019s \u201cbig\u201d. Now that\u2019s not an excuse, it\u2019s still not okay, and in reality you\u2019re both probably heathy, and beautiful, and have no reason to change. But that\u2019s just my guess as to why she\u2019s been projecting onto you, and why she reacted the way she did. \n\nApproaching it the way you did was hurtful and not great either, but like I said I can absolutely sympathize with where you were coming from and how you got pushed to that point. Sounds like going out of your way to support her in rebuilding that confidence is the way to go at this point. And hopefully she\u2019ll stop commenting about your body too!", "NTA.

She's an asshole for this and if doesn't seem like it's coming from a place of concern. She sounds judgmental and not accepting of who you are.

I had a \u201cfriend\u201d in college who would make comments about my body daily (i.e., call me \u201cbirdbones\u201d, ask me if I secretly throw up after meals, grab my wrist and say \u201cyou\u2019re so thin I could snap you in half\u201d etc.). I asked her to stop numerous times and did my best to ignore her comments but she\u2019d always respond by saying that telling someone they\u2019re skinny is a compliment. Eventually I snapped. She had two cookies in her hand as she was talking about how it\u2019s not fair that I\u2019m so skinny. I looked at the cookies in her hand and said \u201cmaybe if you didn\u2019t eat so many cookies, you\u2019d be skinny too.\u201d She started bawling and called me a bitch. I did feel bad for my comment but honestly not super bad when I thought about the countless comments she made about my body and how frequently she made me feel uncomfortable/almost guilty for existing in my thin body. We stopped hanging out after that and it was probably best for both of us. It\u2019s exhausting to be around someone who always comments on how thin you are and justifies it as being a compliment.

If she can't have a civil, respectful conversation with you about this, and recognize that what she was doing was wrong and apologize for it, you need to rethink your dedication to this relationship. \n\nI don't understand all these E S H.

A good partner doesn't always have to be perfect, but they also wouldn't deliberately do things to lower your self-esteem and make you more self-conscious. It's psychological abuse and if I was you I would strongly reflect on whether the good things in your relationship outweigh things like that because things like that WILL eat on you over time. It's impossible for hurtful and degrading comments made my a loved one not to affect you when they're made this often.", "NTA and I suggest you show her this thread and comments.

It doesn\u2019t matter if someone is skinny or fat, it\u2019s never ok to put someone down, make unprompted remarks about a persons body or appearance and constantly make fun of someone else. I think you need to take a step back and realize if this relationship is healthy and if it\u2019s for you any more. You should be with someone who builds you up and makes you feel good, not tears you down and intentionally hurts your feelings.", "NTA Stop apologizing. If she wants to accept an apology, she can accept the one she's already gotten. Tell her that what she did is just as hurtful, and that you won't tolerate abusive language any more than she does.

Don't dish it if you can't take it. \n\nShort guide in how to gain muscle and weight from a previously very scrawny guy.\n\n1. Learn to count your calories. You need to understand that most likely you think you eat enough but in reality you are undereating. 3000-3500kcal a day should be your norm.\n\n2. Eat 6 times a day. 3 regular meals and 3 snack times between. Even of it's a handful of nuts, or a banana, or a PB/J sandwitch.\n\n3. It's much easier to drink your calories. An example: a glass or 2 of orange juice, a spoon of PB, a banana, a scoop of protein powder, a spoon of oats, blended together makes a calory bomb drink, which is easy to drink and will replace a full meal.\nOr even a half a carton of juice will still give you enough kcal to count as a proper snack.\n\n4. Don't listen to your stomach, in the first 2-3 weeks you will feel constantly full. Doesn't matter, you have to eat your 3500kcal every day. It's not that hard when you eat 3 meals and snack 3 times a day. After those first weeks most likely you will start to feel hungry whenever one of your 6 meals is coming up as your body will get used to it. \n\n5. Start going to gym when doing this meal plan. You want your newly acquired calories to turn into muscle and strenght, not fat. Also learn about compound exercises.\n\nWith this kind of eating you should be gaining at least 1kg or 2,2 pounds a month as a minimum. Most likely up to 3 pounds. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA. Granted it wasn\u2019t the best way to defend yourself, you\u2019re not wrong. Nobody\u2019s feeling on their appearance should be downplayed. Being super skinny and unable to gain weight especially in a male is just as awful as a female unable to shed weight. We are trying to live up to western beauty standards and most of us fail on some level. She should be lifting you up if she really loves you, as much as you lift her up.", "She got what she deserved.....she. an dish it out but can't take it \ud83d\ude05", "NTA, everyone has a breaking point. \n\nI say this as a fat person- no one should be body shamed.

How could she not understand that what she was saying was not ok? \n\nBut anyway, yeah, that isn't a cool thing to say to a partner, but she sure didn't seem to get it otherwise. I worry that she still won't.\n\nI mean, she sure didn't seem to listen or respect your boundaries before.  \n\n\nAs an aside:  \n\n\nI wish people would take note that you eat more than she does, and are a lot thinner.

If men want to be looked at as the strong head of the household and a protective person to their gf and later wife her teasing him should not be that big of a deal. Besides men tease each other way worse than she did. It also is crazy how no one is willing to admit OP is wrong and should not have made the comment. I feel like I\u2019m the only person who can see reason here and is willing to say he has crappy behavior. I know my dad would have never said anything like that to my mother because he loves and respects her. I guess that\u2019s my thing this man did not show love and respect to his gf and everyone on Reddit is fine with it. No wonder we live in the world we do. What about her emotions? What about her self-worth? What about the fact these are the kinds of comments that send women into battles with eating disorders. Does none of that seriously matter to you because he can\u2019t handle his gf joking on him but I bet her doesn\u2019t complain when his buddies tease him. Should she have joked with him when she knew he was sensitive and going to be mad about it? I guess not. Did he elevate the situation way past where she ever had? Yes! Did he cross a line yes. Overall the problem is he doesn\u2019t respect her if he talked to her like that. He could have handled the situation better. So I\u2019m not arguing with anyone anymore but he was wrong. I stand by she should break up with him.
