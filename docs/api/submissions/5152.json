Respect is a two-way street. Your GF has been body shaming you for a while and it\u2019s only natural that you reached your breaking point.

Sorry, but you lost the moral high ground when you said that; it\u2019s what 12 year olds do. If she just kept being mean to you and calling you too skinny then you needed to stand up for yourself.

There\u2019s a lot of pressure on women in particular to be thin. It\u2019s likely that the comments she was making about you were a means of projecting her insecurities about her own body. It\u2019s easier for her to convince herself that you\u2019re too thin than it is for her to think that the reason you look \u201csmall\u201d is because she\u2019s \u201cbig\u201d. Now that\u2019s not an excuse, it\u2019s still not okay, and in reality you\u2019re both probably heathy, and beautiful, and have no reason to change. But that\u2019s just my guess as to why she\u2019s been projecting onto you, and why she reacted the way she did. \n\nApproaching it the way you did was hurtful and not great either, but like I said I can absolutely sympathize with where you were coming from and how you got pushed to that point.

She had two cookies in her hand as she was talking about how it\u2019s not fair that I\u2019m so skinny. I looked at the cookies in her hand and said \u201cmaybe if you didn\u2019t eat so many cookies, you\u2019d be skinny too.\u201d She started bawling and called me a bitch. I did feel bad for my comment but honestly not super bad when I thought about the countless comments she made about my body and how frequently she made me feel uncomfortable/almost guilty for existing in my thin body. We stopped hanging out after that and it was probably best for both of us. It\u2019s exhausting to be around someone who always comments on how thin you are and justifies it as being a compliment. NTA", "NTA. Negative and unwanted body comments are negative and unwanted no matter what they are. Especially since you\u2019ve asked her to stop.", "nta and find a new gf who isn't a misandrist", "No, I\u2019m going with NTA. Unwanted comments are unwarranted comments. It\u2019s rude to comment on someone\u2019s weight, people can be just as self conscious about being underweight as they can being overweight. Continuing to comment when someone has asked you to stop is beyond wrong! Jokes are only jokes when all parties find them funny, and if she was genuinely concerned about you being underweight, she\u2019d be suggesting seeing a doctor, or asking to sit down and look at what you both eat and if there\u2019s something that could be done to support you.\nShe had been making you feel bad and nothing you said made her stop, so you showed her how it felt. Tell her that in future, she needs to listen when you ask her to stop upsetting you.", "NTA", "She's insecure and want you to be fatter so she could feel better. \n\nMajor red flag.\n\nNTA", "NTA she knew she was hurting you but she kept doing it anyway. Just because she may struggle with her body image or has been bullied doesn\u2019t mean she can do the same.", "NTA. Y\u2019all need to sit down and have a conversation so you can effectively communicate without throwing barbs. Just remember that your feelings matter just as much as hers.", "NTA you made a mistake and lashed out but you seem genuinely remorseful. The comment you made was rude and I can see why she would be hurt but she has been doing the same thing to you. (And if you eat about the same thing then she knows you're not anorexic so she's def more in the wrong here)", "NTA\n\nHopefully she learns to not do that again.", "NTA your response wasn\u2019t appropriate, thats honest to god going to be the truth no matter what. It did nothing but hurt you both. But your girlfriend has done this to you nonstop without considering how you feel, and despite your communication refused to listen. This should honestly be the time she gets it now or you\u2019re going to make a bigger deal out of it, because she shouldnt be tearing down your confidence daily", "NTA You asked her to stop multiple times and she kept making comments about your weight. I don\u2019t know how skinny being a beauty standard somehow makes your comment more hurtful because it sounds like she\u2019s imposing a beauty standard, of being more muscular, onto you.", "NTA. This is why bullies bully.. they don\u2019t think you\u2019ll do it back. I guarantee those comments were her projecting. Im a much worse person when i feel like trash about myself.", "NTA. You didn't even call her fat of that's what she said.", "NTA it sounds like she's just using you as a punching bag instead of working on her own insecurities. I know it hurts to be called fat, but she was constantly digging at you and nothing else was working to stop her.", "DEFINITELY NTA. HOLY CRAP I'M LMAO RIGHT NOW YOU'RE A GENIUS \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "NTA. She can't see the parallel? She's a moron.", "NTA!!!!!", "NTA", "NTA. She FAFO.", "NTA!\n\nIf she can\u2019t stand criticism she doesn\u2019t have a right to criticise.", "NTA\n\nYou tried to establish a clear and easy to respect boundary with her multiple times and she refused to understand until you gave her a taste of her own medicine and even then insists on doubling down with her refusal to understand. I'm sure she has a functioning brain inside of her skull, she is fully capable of understanding she crossed a line with you here - she simply chooses not to acknowledge it. \n\nAt this point if she refuses to accept your boundary, acknowledge any wrongdoing on her part, and expects this situation to be treated like she did absolutely nothing to instigate the behavior you demonstrated then she's being a toxic partner. \n\nI don't know what to suggest for you because I don't think it's wise to tell you to break up over this because I don't know more about your situation, but at the same time I can say that if I were in your shoes I would break up with the person who keeps insisting on making digs at my appearance no matter how many times I tell them to stop. That's not a partner, that's a bully that splits groceries with you. \n\nAlso if being skinny is the beauty standard and she insists on that being the reality, then why exactly does she want you to gain weight? Have her explain that one.", "NTA Your GF was not joking when she was criticizing your body. Joking is intended to make someone laugh. People say it is a joke to excuse their bullying. Some people put others down in order to make themselves feel better. Other times it is because they have low self esteem and they want to lower your self esteem to be equal to theirs.\n\nThis is abusive and I would not advise staying with someone who would belittle you constantly. I hope you can make her understand what she is doing to you and convince her to stop.", "NTA\nBut this relationship sounds bad, break up for the better.", "NTA", "NTA. It seems like you reached a breaking point with her (after a year of her comments eesh) and snapped back at her. If she's calm down and realizes she's sorry for her comments, maybe you guys could look into eating healthy and/or working out together?", "NTA, but . . . why are you dating someone who insults you and makes you feel bad about your body? Who clearly does not care about your feelings? Who you have to insult to try and teach her basic empathy to get that insulting you (gasp!) hurts your feelings, and she still dosen't care.\n\nAt the end of the day, you don't respect yourself. That's what dating this women tells us.", "Important lesson learned: NEVER ever ever ever call a woman fat. This fucks our self confidence even when we think we look better with some gain on... Anyway, apologize and prepare yourself because she'll probably never forget.", "ESH. Your girlfriend should respect that you don't like those kinds of comments, but the way to address it is something along the lines of \"don't comment on my body,\" not fat shaming her. \n\nThere is in fact a huge difference between calling someone skinny, which is general harassing behavior, and calling someone fat, which carries the massive weight of society's reinforcements. Being fat means facing real discrimination in romance, careers, and medical treatment. We're bombarded literally every day with messages that being fat is bad and wrong and a moral failing. \n\nIt's like she hit you with a sock, and you retaliated with a sock full of quarters. They don't have the same impact at all", "ESH. But only lightly for you. It was wrong of her to constantly bodyshame you and ignore your feelings. Nevertheless instead of calling her fat, it would have been better to ask \"how would you feel if I would tell you that you have too much weight?\" Or even less strong \"what you do is exaxtly the same as calling someone fat\". Maybe she would have understood from that in the same way.", "ESH listen you called her fat, which wasn\u2019t cool, but I also think it was warranted, at least a little. Neither of you guys should be speaking to each other this way\u2026 that said gf is definitely the bigger AH", "ESH-It never works out well to insult someone else, especially someone you care about. She shouldn\u2019t be commenting on your body when you\u2019ve asked her repeatedly not to. But, that doesn\u2019t make you justify in insulting her weight. You\u2019re going to have to accept you might have said something that will haunt her for the rest of her life.", "ESH. hurt8ng someone to proof a point never works. Her excusing her bad behavior sucks. You're both jerks.", "I don't know if you're an AH, but I will tell you that it is NEVER, and I mean NEVER, EVER wise to call your girlfriend or wife or any other woman fat. Period.", "INFO  is your girlfriend fat?", "ESH. Honestly I'd have done the same tho, but I recognize I'm a petty bitch and have no issue with that. If someone was constantly body shaming me after I told them repeatedly to cut the shit, yeah I'd body shame them back, but yes it is an asshole move, but again, I don't buy into the whole \"you should take the high road\" bullshit. \n\nLike others have noted as well, this isn't a healthy relationship and you need to either have an adult conversation or gtfo and find someone else.\n\nEdit: spelling", "Smh - Y T A. She's going to dump you. This will be why.", "Because they're doing it as a defense mechanism to cover for their own insecurities.", "Man just said he doesn't like comments about his weight and you go and call him a twig that might snap smh /s", "I haven\u2019t seen my aunt in a couple of months and finally saw her today, and she kept going on about \u201chow skinny you are now\u201d and all I could hear was \u201chow fat you used to be.\u201d I hate those comments about my weight and if she was genuinely concerned she would had a serious conversation with him, not called him names after he asked her to stop.", "Misery loves company", "fr like if she\u2019s crying from being given the exact same treatment she\u2019s giving him, shouldn\u2019t she take the time to actually realize why she shouldn\u2019t be doing it?? she never should\u2019ve done this whole thing in the first place but look where lack of basic respect can take you \ud83d\ude44", "This the definition of their relationship recently", "Really?? I feel like he\u2019d do very well in a relationship with someone who isn\u2019t constantly calling him scrawny or at least listens when he asks them not to. Everyone has a breaking point, even the best", "AND WHEN A GIRL DOES IT, IT'S OKAY? Stop with the double standards kid...", "> playful from her side\n\nNot after being told to stop.", "You've obviously never been a scrawny guy", "But it's okay if the woman bullies the man for being skinny or something like that...", "It\u2019s a metaphor. They aren\u2019t calling anyone a twig", "For what is worth don\u2019t listen to her. Idiots will always be idiots", "May be a stretch", "If it's been happening hundreds of times since you've been together, and you've told her to stop multiple times, then this isn't just a case of her being purposely obtuse anymore - this actually does enter emotional abuse territory. She is emotionally abusing you by leading you to believe that you're the true villain here for making one bad comment about her body in the exact semantics she uses with you just flipped around RIGHT AFTER she said those very words towards you. Suddenly she's climbing the walls in utter hysterics after one comment? I don't buy it. I wouldn't buy it at a 75% discount. \n\nShe wants to manifest a \"rules for thee not for me\" dynamic in your partnership. I can't speak to her underlying motivations and intentions for doing this, but that much is clear from her behavior. She wants to be able to make as many digs towards you as she wants without you making any sort of ruckus over it but is absolutely unwilling to allow any of that energy to be directed towards herself. Even without the hypocrisy on her end of not being able to take what she dishes out, it's still emotional abuse what she's doing to you. \n\nA good partner loves you and your body as they are. I'm not getting that impression from her. \n\nWhat do you think is going to happen should you react exactly as she has here the next time she insults you? If you were to get up, storm away from her, and launch yourself into utter hysterics over one comment would she be tripping over herself trying to fix it? Would she realize that she hurt you and actually try to apologize? Because something about this whole situation tells me that you could be breaking down sobbing from the hurtful insults she makes and she wouldn't care. What do you think would happen?", "Never said it's okay, just said that calling woman fat is always trouble, not that ops girlfriend didn't deserve it.", "You've obviously never rubbed two braincells together to think about systemic problems that don't directly involve you personally. Amazingly, there can be things worse than \"someone hurt my wittle feelings.\"", "Woosh", "LOL. The entire post is about hurt feelings, my friend."]}
