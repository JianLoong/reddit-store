Respect is a two-way street. Your GF has been body shaming you for a while and it\u2019s only natural that you reached your breaking point. See if she is up for an adult conversation about how her comments make you feel and how you didn\u2019t mean what you said but just reacted to her bullying.

If she commenting on your weight then fairs fairs. Non this she's a woman lark as if she is dishing it out.", "ESH. You told her multiple times how the comments make you feel, and yet she persisted. You made a comment wanting her to know how it felt, but that doesn't make you any less the AH", "ESH. She shouldn\u2019t be saying that to you, but you lashed out in a harsh way. Sorry, but you lost the moral high ground when you said that; it\u2019s what 12 year olds do. If she just kept being mean to you and calling you too skinny then you needed to stand up for yourself. If she kept doing it even then, you needed to break up. A relationship where one partner is mean to the other is toxic", "NTA, but obviously not productive.", "ESH. She absolutely shouldn\u2019t be dismissing you or brushing it off when you tell her that her comments hurt you, that\u2019s really not okay and you have very good reason to be frustrated! She shouldn\u2019t be making comments like that about your body in the first place, it\u2019s generally just not an okay thing to do to your partner.\n\nHowever, she\u2019s not wrong about the beauty standards thing. There\u2019s a lot of pressure on women in particular to be thin. It\u2019s likely that the comments she was making about you were a means of projecting her insecurities about her own body. It\u2019s easier for her to convince herself that you\u2019re too thin than it is for her to think that the reason you look \u201csmall\u201d is because she\u2019s \u201cbig\u201d. Now that\u2019s not an excuse, it\u2019s still not okay, and in reality you\u2019re both probably heathy, and beautiful, and have no reason to change. But that\u2019s just my guess as to why she\u2019s been projecting onto you, and why she reacted the way she did. \n\nApproaching it the way you did was hurtful and not great either, but like I said I can absolutely sympathize with where you were coming from and how you got pushed to that point. Sounds like going out of your way to support her in rebuilding that confidence is the way to go at this point. And hopefully she\u2019ll stop commenting about your body too!", "NTA.

It seems like she's pushing her insecurities on you which isn't fair.", "NTA.

You may try phrasing it as yeah thin may be what some want but I know how it feels to stand in front of the mirror and not like or be ok with what\u2019s reflected back. Have you talked to your dr?

She absolutely deserves to feel how she MAKES you feel on the regular.", "ESH\n\nit's not right to her to have been making those comments especially after you told her to stop, and similarly it doesn't really do any good to reply with the same type of comments. \n\nppl who make those comments are usually projecting and if you're in a relationship with someone like that, yeah saying the same type of stuff is not going to help them understand. \n\nthis is the type of thing you might fire back with if it was, like, a friend or sibling being mean. but if this is happening within a relationship i personally would've broken up instead of bothering with that kind of response. if your intention was to stay together then no it was not the right thing to say", "NTA she doesn't get to make snide remarks about your body then cry when you do the same to her. It would be the same if you were a woman. Her being big(I'm assuming) doesn't give her a pass to body shame you for no reason.\n\nEdit: shocked by all the ESH and AH comments.

You didn\u2019t even go very far, just responded to her in the same way she was talking to you.", "ESH. her for saying that stuff, you for giving it back when you were so upset by it. she\u2019s right about being called fat and being so thin being two different things, and the fact you called her fat instead of calling her scrawny (which is what she did to you) suggests to me that you knew the difference and used it to upset her. i understand you being sick of it, i would be too, but this seems unhealthy from both sides.", "You both need to give your heads wobble over the way you are with each other", "Nta but you both need to stop now and talk this out or just call it quits.", "ESH, gently. It's shitty of her to comment on your body in that manner if it isn't coming from a place of concern. It seems malicious coming from her end. I understand being frustrated and wanting to counter that and similarly, showing her how she makes you feel. However, I don't think this was the right way to communicate from both of your perspectives. \n\nI think unless it's coming from a place of sympathetic concern, and very gently worded, it's hard to comment on ones physique. \n\nShe's been making these comments the last year, multiple times a day? She's an asshole for this and if doesn't seem like it's coming from a place of concern. She sounds judgmental and not accepting of who you are. I understand being so frustrated, wanting to give her a piece of her own medicine, but it's not healthy communication. \n\nPerhaps if she is not receptive to your concerns and disregarding your feelings, she is a major asshols. \n\nIt is possible you guys aren't compatible. She doesn't seem good at communication and she just seems malicious from your description in the first few paragraphs. However, two wrongs do not make a right. \n\nFind someone who accepts you as you are and approaches concerns gently, with your best interest in mind.
