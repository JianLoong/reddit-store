If my partner hassled me about it, I\u2019d tell them to stop.  Do people break into cars in locked garages?  Yes, but not often.  It\u2019s not something that happens so frequently you need to worry about it and take active precautions against it.  I mean, if I had something out there I absolutely couldn\u2019t afford to lose or was irreplaceable, (like gold bars or something, lol) I\u2019d take it in.  But $20 or my Ray-Bans?  Eh.\n\nI just share that because I don\u2019t think your husband is some kind of bizarre individual.  This is just the attitude that a lot of people who haven\u2019t had to worry about crime and/or aren\u2019t beset by anxiety have.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean your husband should have lied to you about locking the door (if you are sure he did lie and it wasn\u2019t a matter of forgetting.)\n\nBut the larger issue seems to be that you both have a fundamentally different view of appropriate security precautions.  I don\u2019t think either of you are \u201cwrong\u201d, but it sounds like you are shoving your view of high security off on your husband by buying the security system, having all these plans, etc, and your husband doesn\u2019t agree so is \u201cpassively resisting\u201d the stuff you\u2019re doing.\n\nIt sounds like you guys need to have a talk to clear the air and decide what\u2019s appropriate for your relationship.  Maybe there\u2019s a compromise where you could both do something.  Maybe it\u2019s just an understanding that security means much more to you than him, so anything security related is going to fall on you.  I dunno.\n\nOne thing I want to gently point out though: home invasion, where strangers are breaking in and *specifically* coming for you and/or your children, is vanishingly rare.  This is not something you need to have a plan for, any more than you need to have a plan for winning the Powerball.  It happens, sure, but the chances are infinitesimally small.  \n\nWhen strangers break into your house, they are doing it to steal your things, not to perpetrate violence on you. People who break in to steal usually want to do it when you are not at home.  If you are at home, they absolutely do not want to have a run-in with you (which is why they\u2019ll do it when you\u2019re asleep).  Best thing to do is to stay put and quietly call police. The cases where a robbery, at your home, ends in violence, are usually all ones where the robber was surprised/confronted.\n\nYour worry about something that is vanishingly rare (home invasion for the purpose of inflicting violence and/or kidnapping) leads me to believe that there is a measure of slightly irrational anxiety that you might want to take a closer look at, either through introspection or a therapist.", "NTA These are all perfectly normal things. Instead of asking yourself if you're being paranoid you should be asking HIM why he cares so little for the safety of his wife and baby.", "NTA for being uneasy with the doors unlocked, that is kind of normal to feel that way, but I feel like this \"paranoia\" that is creating tension in your relationship, could possibly an undiagnosed anxiety disorder. One way we find out these things is that our \"unexplainable feelings\" begin to cause problems in our relationships with others, and it appears that seems to be happening to you. \n\nSince you being scared IS CAUSING ISSUES, it is more than likely anxiety that you do not have the tools to control and THAT IS OKAY. Mood disorders are NOT A CHOICE we make, they happen. Our brain goes wonky and we are unable to feel better by ignoring it. Unfortunately, some mood disorders like anxiety can be progressive, which means it can get worse the longer you go without treating or managing it. \n\nThere is an EXCELLENT book by two doctors that gives you TOOLS that you can learn and utilize to help you deal with your anxiety productively. It's called \"Needing To Know For Sure\". I was able to get a gently used copy online for around 8 dollars, US.  I believe there may even be a free pdf download available somewhere as well.\n\nIt REALLY HELPED four people I know to get a handle on their anxious feelings. It has this way of looking at our anxious thoughts that just BLEW my mind; it's like, \"okay I live close to an airport,  yet I'm not always anxious about the planes that fly over the house thinking they may crash onto the house, but I freak out when the window is unlocked...they are BOTH things to be scared of, but why does my brain OBSSESS on one and not the other?\"  Then it teaches you that the only difference in those situations is how UNCOMFORTABLE you feel about each of them and how to train yourself to be okay with that feeling of discomfort....it's not easy to explain, but it's REALLY HELPFUL and it's amazing how much it changed things just by using the really simple mental tools it gives you.\n\nI hope you can get the book and good luck.  I'm not pushing the book for any agenda, I just think it is the best book for helping people with anxiety.", "NTA\nBut your husband is. I lived in a really safe area but because I lived on my own I always locked my doors, the one time I didn't somebody walked right in! Now they were looking for somebody who lived a few doors down (we had similar cars) and it was an older woman so not much of a threat to me in that moment but it frightened the hell out of me! It's desperately unfair for your husband to fail in his duty to protect his child and wife (especially as you have tried to protect him too!). You aren't asking for much, just basic (Very basic) things like closing a door amd locking it. It honestly sounds like your husband has no respect for you and this is an issue that needs to be addressed. Maybe you should have a read of the women's subs here and see how often woman are attacked or threatened because it sounds like your husband thinks these issues are imagined but they are very real things that happen to women regularly and you could share these with your husband so he understands why you are fearful. Adding to that, this hoise has been broken into before so who knows who might decide to come back. Your husband is being irresponsible and putting you and your child in danger.", "NTA. I think you are overthinking some risks, but, as your husband, he needs to understand what you need. \nYou could have a normal conversation as adults about what you both want and agree on it, but je has to respect your feelings if you\u2019re feeling insecure.", "NTA everything you described is perfectly normal and rational and things everyone should be doing anyway.", "NAH\n\nWhile most of these sound like yes, they're basic safeguards against your home being stolen from, the comment \"whenever I bring up this plan\" seems to imply that you're talking about it slightly more often that most would consider reasonable.\n\nI'd sit down and have a proper conversation with him about it, but also listen to his take on things, as it appears that it's less about the precautions you're asking of him, and more about how often you're asking.", "NTA\n\nI feel like not locking the door is just a difference in growing up, but lying about it is too much of an AH move, since it will make you a bit nervous and that lying is just generally stupid and AH-like\n\nDid you go on tirades or yell at him whenever he forget something? If not, then you should be careful of him being a consistent liar.", "lady you need therapy. like 95% of the time he makes sure it's locked. like if you wanted to make sure it was locked so bad yu go check. you're paranoid and it's not going to get any better when it comes to the kid when he gets older. don't be one of them moms. just don't. you can't expect your husband to be on he same wave length when it comes to this stuff. its not healthy.", "NTA. It shouldn't be an issue making sure your wife and children feel safe in their home. It makes sense to ensure all doors are locked to prevent opportunistic thieves from entering.", "NTA. Let me preface this by saying I'm more like your boyfriend. Safety conscious but I'm more loose. My boyfriend is like you, just not quite as paranoid. We had a few talks about we handle each others apartments security when we stay at one of our places, I just adhere to his rules and he adheres to mine. I expect when we move in together we will use his security measures, since he wants his stuff to be safe to his standards and I understand that. Further, I did the math even though it's super unnecessary, but if the 5% are true and he goes in and out of the house twice a day that means the door stays unlocked once a week. I understand that you don't like that and insist he checks, and especially that he DOESN'T LIE ABOUT IT. I recommend to change your apartment door to one that can't be opened from the outside by not having a handle/only having a knob that can't be twisted or anything, then locking that door isn't explicitly necessary", "NTA. Your precautions are certainly not unreasonable. Your husband is being unfair by diminishing your concerns. It\u2019s basic safety! It only takes one chance happening for something to go horribly wrong.", "NTA. all of these things are pretty normal daily precautions. i've accidentally locked people out of their own house when i visit them, because my instinct from being a girl living alone is to immediately lock every outside door behind me. \n\nthat said, changing a person's mindset and habits is hard to do, and you can ask him to be as diligent about safety as you are, but you can't really get mad at him for not feeling it's as big of a priority as you do. \n\ninstead, maybe make it easier for you to take these precautions yourself. if you installed your security system yourself, i'm guessing it has an app? you can add things like security cameras and window sensors where you can set it and see the status from the app and there are other things you can install yourself, like a door lock you can check/lock from your phone so if it happens again, nobody has to get out of bed.", "NTA. These are, as you said in your title, *basic* safety precautions. You are not wrong to want doors locked, valuables out of sight, and a safety plan in place. That's not paranoid, that's smart.\n\n\"Safe\" neighborhoods get hit by crime as well as \"unsafe\". I suspect they are robbed more often because people there have better stuff, and they do tend to be laxer in their safety precautions (because they're \"safe\").", "NTA, i would be livid if my partner didnt care about my concerns to this point. Especially since my area has had a lot of car break ins lately. You arent asking too much, you're asking for the bare minimum imo.", "I\u2019ll probably get downvoted to oblivion, but I say YTA.\n\nYou are paranoid, not him. If you want to lock the doors, then you do it. If he does it 95% of the time, then let it go and simply ensure that it\u2019s locked yourself. \n\nAs long as he doesn\u2019t leave your valuables in plain sight, only his, then it\u2019s not your issue.\n\nMy husband and I are somewhat similar. He\u2019s paranoid, I\u2019m not. I\u2019ll placate him by locking the doors, but I gotta tell you, it\u2019s just not the first thing on my mind and I forget, a lot. If he locks it, that\u2019s fine, but if he continuously nagged me to do it, I would become very frustrated over it. \nL", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's ok to do that if the car is in a locked garage; out on street parking though? Completely different story and a very quick and easy way to get your stuff stolen.\n\nHe is an AH for lying about locking the door though. That's not good enough behaviour from him.

Leaving valuables in an otherwise locked garage doesn't seem particularly risky.  Pepper spray and safe room strategies in an otherwise quiet neighborhood seems a bit unnecessary too - unless there is a rash of home invasions I haven't heard about.

These are valid concerns, especially if you live in the United States.

Chores, hobbies, even little things like leaving light-switches on or flipping them off.

I wasn't raised to care how the tupperware was stacked, but okay, I'll try to pay attention in the future. I know you're trying to turn every light off, so okay, I'll just do a last sweep of the house before we leave and turn off any you forget without comment. \n\nIt sounds like you haven't gotten there with security practices. Rather than saying, \"I don't remember if I locked the door, but I'll go check,\" he lies. Instead of just saying, \"My bad, I'll try to remember in the future,\" he complains. Instead of trying to comply with a basic safety measure like not keeping goods out in the open in a car, he is incredulous that someone can break into a garage. \n\nIt's also not like you're insisting on unreasonable or extreme safety measures. Locked doors are basic. Having a discussion of what to do in an emergency is common sense. If you're already closing the house most of the time, and he can't even afford to check one door when you specifically ask, he's obviously the AH.

First is are you sure that he intentionally lied about locking the door or did he just thought he did?  Like you said 95% of the time he locks the door so it is possible he just thought he did and was too tired to get out of bed to check.  You seem to be just assuming he intentionally left the door unlocked.\n\nSecond you mention he gets annoyed anytime you mention your break in plan.  How often are you going over this plan?  If you have brought it up a couple times in the last few months that is reasonable but if you insist to go over it every few days that can be very annoying.\n\nThird what is this DIY security system you installed?  Is it something you bought online or did you pull a Home Alone on your house and set up make shift traps?\n\nOverall I do think you are being a little overly paranoid about your safety.  I mean you were too scared of your own home at night to simply check if the door was locked, even if it was for your own peace of mind.  Unless there are people banging against your windows all the time there really shouldn't be a rational reason for you to be afraid to walk around your own home in the dark to make sure the doors are locked.  \n\nI myself am very mindful of my home's safety.  I still live at home with the majority of my family and my brother constantly leaves the doors unlocked to our house.  We have talked to him several times about it but he doesn't care.  So I go around the house before I got to bed and make sure all the doors are closed and locked tight.  If your own fears are preventing you from making sure your house is safe yourself and assume your husband is intentionally endangering you when it doesn't appear that way, you should really see a professional about them.  Right now I am leaning towards YTA.", "I offer a different perspective. By doing all these things, you're telling him you don't feel safe. You're telling him that you don't depend on him to protect you. That feels like disrespect to him, so he'll likely get upset.

In ancient times, the species flourished because of it, so it's probably something he's not even aware of. Perhaps you could appreciate it when he does do something? Instead of taking it personally and getting upset at mistakes, why not appreciate the many times he does something right? How would you feel if someone you cared about got all upset at something missed, that you did at their insistence, that felt unloving? \n\nJust an idea, I'm not attacking or discounting anyone, it's an idea for OP's consideration, to see if she wants to try something new that might reduce the fights.", "ESH but he sucks me\n\nYou are being overly safe.\n\nHe is not being safe enough (leaving valuables in car in garage is not great, leaving doors unlocked 5% of the time is not great)\n\nHe is also downplaying your concerns when really, it would be easy to just listen and be safer to make you feel better.

When I was a kid, my parents would often leave valuables in the car as well and saw nothing wrong with it. Until the one time someone broke in and stole the navigation system mounted to the windshield. Only then did my parents, siblings and I learn to take or at least hide valuables out of plain sight.", "Oh I love this man to death but I think he is fully aware if something happened he wouldn\u2019t be very proactive and I would be the one to take the lead while he\u2019d be taking orders lol.", "I mean OP couldn't be bothered to check either.  Their own fears and paranoia are making it so the responsibility of the baby's safety is their husband's responsibility solely.", "My husband and I agree I would be an excellent mob wife.", "If you look up the Ring security system it is something like that. Essentially just a security system that you set up yourself but is still professionally monitored.", "Thank you, I like that last part a lot. I will work on that!", "Fair take! As for the DIY system, check out the Ring or SimpliSafe security systems. You customize the exact components you need for your home and set it up yourself, but it\u2019s all still connected and working in tandem via the app and is professionally monitored if you\u2019d like it to be.", "OP just said he was lying, not that he admitted he knowingly didn't lock the door and told them he did.

So awful. I\u2019m pretty sure he knows about that too because we listened to the same podcast. \n\nBut my husband is just one of those people who thinks since the probability is so low that it would ever happen to us, that means it will never happen to us.

Why blame the woman for the man\u2019s lack of common sense?", "The point is the busband won't be responsible like he should be", "That's not the point. He's still an AH for getting visibly annoyed and dismissive when she even brings it up.", "Thank you, I personally agree with all of this. If he had said either of those things instead of promising I wouldn\u2019t have been upset this morning at all.", "Sure! I\u2019ve mentioned a lot of this in comments but I\u2019ll condense it all here.\n\n1. I don\u2019t think he maliciously lied but I think he was clearly not 100% sure if he did or did not lock the door and promising something when you\u2019re not sure is a weird thing to do. \n\nSo to me, he lied that he was 100% sure when he clearly wasn\u2019t if the door was unlocked. If he had admitted he wasn\u2019t sure either way it would be a different story for me. \n\nHe also hasn\u2019t even apologized which if I were in his shoes and was completely confident I did something which I actually didn\u2019t do, I would have apologized and been confused myself.\n\n2.

Lol, it is just a regular security system but instead of being one where you pay people to set it up - you order specific components suited to your house and set it up yourself. It\u2019s not a traditional system but it\u2019s still professionally monitored and all connected via app.", "Insurance companies will often have clauses about leaving something unlocked will void coverage, and might have a clause about leaving valuables in view in a car. The reason thiefs target residential neighborhoods is exactly the reason your husband is doing these things; people tend to feel more secure in their home and their home neighborhood, and therefore are less likely to take precautions and are more likely to make mistakes because they let their guard down. \n\nRecently, there was a story about how Jenna Marbles' house was broken into by a stalker/fan, the only reason the situation *didn't* escalate is because her partner immediately pepper sprayed the intruder when she got into the house and apprehended her while police arrived. Having a safety plan is needed, especially as you have a baby. You should make a fire plan too, if you haven't already, and have a plan for updating it as your kiddo grows and is able to help themselves get out during a fire.\n\nI'll also add, never leave electronics in the car, even in a garage. Garage doors are easy for a thief to open (relatively speaking), and many garages don't have insulation and heating/cooling like the rest of the house, and the temperature changes will damage them.", "I know plenty people who have been robbed whilst they were home, somebody came in and took my friends mum\u2019s handbag on one occasion due to an unlocked back door \n\nAnother was friends at uni who shared a flat 3 of them literally were all in their rooms, front door unlocked, somebody walked in took their tv and left, everybody was so confused where the tv had gone but the guy was caught and confessed (tv was already sold on though and not recovered)\n\nI do think you sound very cautious but 100% NTA you have a BABY!! My heart stopped when you said you that, omg how could he be so careless with the door!!

Having your unoccupied car broken into isn't an issue of personal safety. It's annoying, and costs money, but you aren't personally at risk. Most home invasions happen when homes are unoccupied, because they're people looking for things to steal, not looking to hurt people. That's not to say you shouldn't take basic security precautions, like locking doors and even having cameras, but having him repeatedly go over a safe room plan is a bit much. Get smart locks. Make sure all your exterior doors have deadbolts. And then take a deep breath and try to keep things in perspective.", ">So the fact that either straight up lied or he promised when he clearly wasn\u2019t sure to placate me really bothered me. \n\nOr he genuinely thought he did and was mistaken.\n\nI highly doubt there's a single person in this thread that hasn't, at least once in their life, thought they did something like locking the door or turning off the oven or the faucet, or something, and it turned out they were wrong.\n\nIf this were a repeated pattern, of him being sure he locked the door and it turned out he didn't, that would be different.

It seems that the baby is very young so have you mentioned it a few times in the past month or past year?  He knows the plan, to keep going \"if something bad happens remember to go to the baby's room\" over and over can be annoying and frankly paranoid.  Like you expect a break in is going to happen not as a possibility but an eventuality that definitely will happen any minute.", "I get where you're coming from, I really do, but sharing means compromise. Leaving something in a vehicle, inside a locked garage isn't the same level of risk as leaving it in a car on a street. And even when you do everything correctly, sometimes, bad things happen. \n\nI'm actually a lot like you, in terms of wanting to control risk, but I understand that sometimes my anxieties can overwhelm people. I've invested in things like \"smart\" locks and security cameras so that I can easily tell if something is unlocked and lock it remotely. This has helped a lot, and taken a lot of pressure off of my spouse.", "First him thinking he locked the door but turns out he forgot isn't lying.  That is a mistake anyone can make.  \n\nSecond even a handful of times is excessive to remind someone of the plans in case of an emergency.  Realistically these plans are something you discuss once a year when doing house maintenance or when a change in lifestyle happens.  To repeatedly go over emergency plans even just a handful of times in a month is excessive.\n\nYou really need to seek therapy for your paranoia as it seems your parents' paranoia has rubbed off on you more than you think.

There's so many of them that the exterior of the door where the fire was in completely charred, but the inside is only mildly burnt. It buys you precious time.\n\nLook at the possible exits in your house, and be creative! A window is also an exit, and a broken ankle from going out of a second floor window is better than burns and smoke inhalation. Tying bedsheets together into a rope with a sling at the end and using it to slowly lower your baby to the ground is a good option so you don't have to drop your child out of the window to someone else. Talk about if a fire were to happen at night, who is going to find an escape route and who is going to get the child. The person finding the escape route can yell where the fire is located and if you can use a door or window to get out. You'll also need to have the rough discussion of putting your child first even if it means leaving your partner in the home. It's heartbreaking to think about, but necessary to discuss.\n\nWhen your child is older, teach them about fire hazards (leaving hair curlers/straighteners on, leaving the oven on, putting things on radiators) and to immediately alert an adult if they see it. Teach them to stay close to the ground if there's a fire, how to block the door, and to make sure they get out of the house above all else. Say you'll be fine, you can find a way out on your own, you just want them to be safe first is important.

In either case, he has not owned up to his responsibility and he has continued a pattern of not taking reasonable safety precautions seriously. \n\nNo, OP is not paranoid for having a justified belief that OP was either mistaken or lying about the door being locked, when in fact that belief was borne out.
