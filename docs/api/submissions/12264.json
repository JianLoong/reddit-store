If my partner hassled me about it, I\u2019d tell them to stop.  Do people break into cars in locked garages?  Yes, but not often.  It\u2019s not something that happens so frequently you need to worry about it and take active precautions against it.  I mean, if I had something out there I absolutely couldn\u2019t afford to lose or was irreplaceable, (like gold bars or something, lol) I\u2019d take it in.  But $20 or my Ray-Bans?  Eh.\n\nI just share that because I don\u2019t think your husband is some kind of bizarre individual.  This is just the attitude that a lot of people who haven\u2019t had to worry about crime and/or aren\u2019t beset by anxiety have.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean your husband should have lied to you about locking the door (if you are sure he did lie and it wasn\u2019t a matter of forgetting.)\n\nBut the larger issue seems to be that you both have a fundamentally different view of appropriate security precautions.  I don\u2019t think either of you are \u201cwrong\u201d, but it sounds like you are shoving your view of high security off on your husband by buying the security system, having all these plans, etc, and your husband doesn\u2019t agree so is \u201cpassively resisting\u201d the stuff you\u2019re doing.\n\nIt sounds like you guys need to have a talk to clear the air and decide what\u2019s appropriate for your relationship.  Maybe there\u2019s a compromise where you could both do something.  Maybe it\u2019s just an understanding that security means much more to you than him, so anything security related is going to fall on you.  I dunno.\n\nOne thing I want to gently point out though: home invasion, where strangers are breaking in and *specifically* coming for you and/or your children, is vanishingly rare.  This is not something you need to have a plan for, any more than you need to have a plan for winning the Powerball.  It happens, sure, but the chances are infinitesimally small.  \n\nWhen strangers break into your house, they are doing it to steal your things, not to perpetrate violence on you. People who break in to steal usually want to do it when you are not at home.  If you are at home, they absolutely do not want to have a run-in with you (which is why they\u2019ll do it when you\u2019re asleep).  Best thing to do is to stay put and quietly call police. The cases where a robbery, at your home, ends in violence, are usually all ones where the robber was surprised/confronted.\n\nYour worry about something that is vanishingly rare (home invasion for the purpose of inflicting violence and/or kidnapping) leads me to believe that there is a measure of slightly irrational anxiety that you might want to take a closer look at, either through introspection or a therapist.", "NTA These are all perfectly normal things. Instead of asking yourself if you're being paranoid you should be asking HIM why he cares so little for the safety of his wife and baby.", "NTA for being uneasy with the doors unlocked, that is kind of normal to feel that way, but I feel like this \"paranoia\" that is creating tension in your relationship, could possibly an undiagnosed anxiety disorder. One way we find out these things is that our \"unexplainable feelings\" begin to cause problems in our relationships with others, and it appears that seems to be happening to you. \n\nSince you being scared IS CAUSING ISSUES, it is more than likely anxiety that you do not have the tools to control and THAT IS OKAY. Mood disorders are NOT A CHOICE we make, they happen. Our brain goes wonky and we are unable to feel better by ignoring it. Unfortunately, some mood disorders like anxiety can be progressive, which means it can get worse the longer you go without treating or managing it. \n\nThere is an EXCELLENT book by two doctors that gives you TOOLS that you can learn and utilize to help you deal with your anxiety productively. It's called \"Needing To Know For Sure\". I was able to get a gently used copy online for around 8 dollars, US.  I believe there may even be a free pdf download available somewhere as well.\n\nIt REALLY HELPED four people I know to get a handle on their anxious feelings. It has this way of looking at our anxious thoughts that just BLEW my mind; it's like, \"okay I live close to an airport,  yet I'm not always anxious about the planes that fly over the house thinking they may crash onto the house, but I freak out when the window is unlocked...they are BOTH things to be scared of, but why does my brain OBSSESS on one and not the other?\"  Then it teaches you that the only difference in those situations is how UNCOMFORTABLE you feel about each of them and how to train yourself to be okay with that feeling of discomfort....it's not easy to explain, but it's REALLY HELPFUL and it's amazing how much it changed things just by using the really simple mental tools it gives you.\n\nI hope you can get the book and good luck.  I'm not pushing the book for any agenda, I just think it is the best book for helping people with anxiety.", "NTA\nBut your husband is. I lived in a really safe area but because I lived on my own I always locked my doors, the one time I didn't somebody walked right in! Now they were looking for somebody who lived a few doors down (we had similar cars) and it was an older woman so not much of a threat to me in that moment but it frightened the hell out of me! It's desperately unfair for your husband to fail in his duty to protect his child and wife (especially as you have tried to protect him too!). You aren't asking for much, just basic (Very basic) things like closing a door amd locking it. It honestly sounds like your husband has no respect for you and this is an issue that needs to be addressed. Maybe you should have a read of the women's subs here and see how often woman are attacked or threatened because it sounds like your husband thinks these issues are imagined but they are very real things that happen to women regularly and you could share these with your husband so he understands why you are fearful. Adding to that, this hoise has been broken into before so who knows who might decide to come back. Your husband is being irresponsible and putting you and your child in danger.", "NTA. I think you are overthinking some risks, but, as your husband, he needs to understand what you need. \nYou could have a normal conversation as adults about what you both want and agree on it, but je has to respect your feelings if you\u2019re feeling insecure.", "NTA everything you described is perfectly normal and rational and things everyone should be doing anyway.", "NAH\n\nWhile most of these sound like yes, they're basic safeguards against your home being stolen from, the comment \"whenever I bring up this plan\" seems to imply that you're talking about it slightly more often that most would consider reasonable.\n\nI'd sit down and have a proper conversation with him about it, but also listen to his take on things, as it appears that it's less about the precautions you're asking of him, and more about how often you're asking.", "NTA\n\nI feel like not locking the door is just a difference in growing up, but lying about it is too much of an AH move, since it will make you a bit nervous and that lying is just generally stupid and AH-like\n\nDid you go on tirades or yell at him whenever he forget something? If not, then you should be careful of him being a consistent liar.", "lady you need therapy. like 95% of the time he makes sure it's locked. like if you wanted to make sure it was locked so bad yu go check. you're paranoid and it's not going to get any better when it comes to the kid when he gets older. don't be one of them moms. just don't. you can't expect your husband to be on he same wave length when it comes to this stuff. its not healthy.", "NTA. It shouldn't be an issue making sure your wife and children feel safe in their home. It makes sense to ensure all doors are locked to prevent opportunistic thieves from entering.", "NTA. Let me preface this by saying I'm more like your boyfriend. Safety conscious but I'm more loose. My boyfriend is like you, just not quite as paranoid. We had a few talks about we handle each others apartments security when we stay at one of our places, I just adhere to his rules and he adheres to mine. I expect when we move in together we will use his security measures, since he wants his stuff to be safe to his standards and I understand that. Further, I did the math even though it's super unnecessary, but if the 5% are true and he goes in and out of the house twice a day that means the door stays unlocked once a week. I understand that you don't like that and insist he checks, and especially that he DOESN'T LIE ABOUT IT. I recommend to change your apartment door to one that can't be opened from the outside by not having a handle/only having a knob that can't be twisted or anything, then locking that door isn't explicitly necessary", "NTA. Your precautions are certainly not unreasonable. Your husband is being unfair by diminishing your concerns. It\u2019s basic safety! It only takes one chance happening for something to go horribly wrong.", "NTA. all of these things are pretty normal daily precautions. i've accidentally locked people out of their own house when i visit them, because my instinct from being a girl living alone is to immediately lock every outside door behind me. \n\nthat said, changing a person's mindset and habits is hard to do, and you can ask him to be as diligent about safety as you are, but you can't really get mad at him for not feeling it's as big of a priority as you do. \n\ninstead, maybe make it easier for you to take these precautions yourself. if you installed your security system yourself, i'm guessing it has an app? you can add things like security cameras and window sensors where you can set it and see the status from the app and there are other things you can install yourself, like a door lock you can check/lock from your phone so if it happens again, nobody has to get out of bed.", "NTA. These are, as you said in your title, *basic* safety precautions. You are not wrong to want doors locked, valuables out of sight, and a safety plan in place. That's not paranoid, that's smart.\n\n\"Safe\" neighborhoods get hit by crime as well as \"unsafe\". I suspect they are robbed more often because people there have better stuff, and they do tend to be laxer in their safety precautions (because they're \"safe\").", "NTA, i would be livid if my partner didnt care about my concerns to this point. Especially since my area has had a lot of car break ins lately. You arent asking too much, you're asking for the bare minimum imo.", "I\u2019ll probably get downvoted to oblivion, but I say YTA.\n\nYou are paranoid, not him. If you want to lock the doors, then you do it. If he does it 95% of the time, then let it go and simply ensure that it\u2019s locked yourself. \n\nAs long as he doesn\u2019t leave your valuables in plain sight, only his, then it\u2019s not your issue.\n\nMy husband and I are somewhat similar. He\u2019s paranoid, I\u2019m not. I\u2019ll placate him by locking the doors, but I gotta tell you, it\u2019s just not the first thing on my mind and I forget, a lot. If he locks it, that\u2019s fine, but if he continuously nagged me to do it, I would become very frustrated over it. \nL", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's ok to do that if the car is in a locked garage; out on street parking though? Completely different story and a very quick and easy way to get your stuff stolen.\n\nHe is an AH for lying about locking the door though. That's not good enough behaviour from him.

Leaving valuables in an otherwise locked garage doesn't seem particularly risky.  Pepper spray and safe room strategies in an otherwise quiet neighborhood seems a bit unnecessary too - unless there is a rash of home invasions I haven't heard about.

I'm the same way and now that I have kids, I'm even more paranoid. FYI- it doesn't matter who you are and where you are, these precautions are to help prevent stuff. A close friend was robbed while the family was sleeping upstairs- the burglars used a crow bar to get in through the garage window (which didn't have a alarm) and came in through garage door into house... so now my door to the garage also has deadbolts...", "Work on that being the problem, that you are afraid for your safety, and it is irrelevant if he personally feels that it's a non-issue. It is a fear, he needs to respect that it causes you anxiety. It's a small thing he refuses to do, but creates incredibly large amounts of untrust in the relationship.", "My advice would be to 1) talk to him about your feelings. Tell him that even if he thinks you are unreasonable and paranoid, it's about you and your peace of mind, even if there's little objective danger. And then 2) get a smart lock installed, something that can be set up to lock automatically at a set time or 5-10 minutes after the door is closed. That should take this stress factor out of your marriage.", "I just like to inform folks of the interesting things that go bump in the night. I just feel this woman's fears are valid, and I say this as someone who lives in a house whose doors haven't been locked in 27 years.", "We have an old door in our garage so it\u2019s a possibility someone could very easily pick it, but mostly I think it\u2019s just a good habit to practice and I worry if he doesn\u2019t make it a habit he\u2019ll leave valuables in the car in other instances like his parking garage at work."]}
