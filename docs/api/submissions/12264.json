If my partner hassled me about it, I\u2019d tell them to stop.  Do people break into cars in locked garages?  Yes, but not often.  It\u2019s not something that happens so frequently you need to worry about it and take active precautions against it.  I mean, if I had something out there I absolutely couldn\u2019t afford to lose or was irreplaceable, (like gold bars or something, lol) I\u2019d take it in.  But $20 or my Ray-Bans?  Eh.\n\nI just share that because I don\u2019t think your husband is some kind of bizarre individual.  This is just the attitude that a lot of people who haven\u2019t had to worry about crime and/or aren\u2019t beset by anxiety have.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean your husband should have lied to you about locking the door (if you are sure he did lie and it wasn\u2019t a matter of forgetting.)\n\nBut the larger issue seems to be that you both have a fundamentally different view of appropriate security precautions.  I don\u2019t think either of you are \u201cwrong\u201d, but it sounds like you are shoving your view of high security off on your husband by buying the security system, having all these plans, etc, and your husband doesn\u2019t agree so is \u201cpassively resisting\u201d the stuff you\u2019re doing.\n\nIt sounds like you guys need to have a talk to clear the air and decide what\u2019s appropriate for your relationship.  Maybe there\u2019s a compromise where you could both do something.  Maybe it\u2019s just an understanding that security means much more to you than him, so anything security related is going to fall on you.  I dunno.\n\nOne thing I want to gently point out though: home invasion, where strangers are breaking in and *specifically* coming for you and/or your children, is vanishingly rare.  This is not something you need to have a plan for, any more than you need to have a plan for winning the Powerball.  It happens, sure, but the chances are infinitesimally small.  \n\nWhen strangers break into your house, they are doing it to steal your things, not to perpetrate violence on you. People who break in to steal usually want to do it when you are not at home.  If you are at home, they absolutely do not want to have a run-in with you (which is why they\u2019ll do it when you\u2019re asleep).  Best thing to do is to stay put and quietly call police. The cases where a robbery, at your home, ends in violence, are usually all ones where the robber was surprised/confronted.\n\nYour worry about something that is vanishingly rare (home invasion for the purpose of inflicting violence and/or kidnapping) leads me to believe that there is a measure of slightly irrational anxiety that you might want to take a closer look at, either through introspection or a therapist.", "NTA These are all perfectly normal things. Instead of asking yourself if you're being paranoid you should be asking HIM why he cares so little for the safety of his wife and baby.", "NTA for being uneasy with the doors unlocked, that is kind of normal to feel that way, but I feel like this \"paranoia\" that is creating tension in your relationship, could possibly an undiagnosed anxiety disorder. One way we find out these things is that our \"unexplainable feelings\" begin to cause problems in our relationships with others, and it appears that seems to be happening to you. \n\nSince you being scared IS CAUSING ISSUES, it is more than likely anxiety that you do not have the tools to control and THAT IS OKAY. Mood disorders are NOT A CHOICE we make, they happen. Our brain goes wonky and we are unable to feel better by ignoring it. Unfortunately, some mood disorders like anxiety can be progressive, which means it can get worse the longer you go without treating or managing it. \n\nThere is an EXCELLENT book by two doctors that gives you TOOLS that you can learn and utilize to help you deal with your anxiety productively. It's called \"Needing To Know For Sure\". I was able to get a gently used copy online for around 8 dollars, US.  I believe there may even be a free pdf download available somewhere as well.\n\nIt REALLY HELPED four people I know to get a handle on their anxious feelings. It has this way of looking at our anxious thoughts that just BLEW my mind; it's like, \"okay I live close to an airport,  yet I'm not always anxious about the planes that fly over the house thinking they may crash onto the house, but I freak out when the window is unlocked...they are BOTH things to be scared of, but why does my brain OBSSESS on one and not the other?\"  Then it teaches you that the only difference in those situations is how UNCOMFORTABLE you feel about each of them and how to train yourself to be okay with that feeling of discomfort....it's not easy to explain, but it's REALLY HELPFUL and it's amazing how much it changed things just by using the really simple mental tools it gives you.\n\nI hope you can get the book and good luck.  I'm not pushing the book for any agenda, I just think it is the best book for helping people with anxiety.", "NTA\nBut your husband is. I lived in a really safe area but because I lived on my own I always locked my doors, the one time I didn't somebody walked right in! Now they were looking for somebody who lived a few doors down (we had similar cars) and it was an older woman so not much of a threat to me in that moment but it frightened the hell out of me! It's desperately unfair for your husband to fail in his duty to protect his child and wife (especially as you have tried to protect him too!). You aren't asking for much, just basic (Very basic) things like closing a door amd locking it. It honestly sounds like your husband has no respect for you and this is an issue that needs to be addressed. Maybe you should have a read of the women's subs here and see how often woman are attacked or threatened because it sounds like your husband thinks these issues are imagined but they are very real things that happen to women regularly and you could share these with your husband so he understands why you are fearful. Adding to that, this hoise has been broken into before so who knows who might decide to come back. Your husband is being irresponsible and putting you and your child in danger.", "NTA. I think you are overthinking some risks, but, as your husband, he needs to understand what you need. \nYou could have a normal conversation as adults about what you both want and agree on it, but je has to respect your feelings if you\u2019re feeling insecure.", "NTA everything you described is perfectly normal and rational and things everyone should be doing anyway.", "NAH\n\nWhile most of these sound like yes, they're basic safeguards against your home being stolen from, the comment \"whenever I bring up this plan\" seems to imply that you're talking about it slightly more often that most would consider reasonable.\n\nI'd sit down and have a proper conversation with him about it, but also listen to his take on things, as it appears that it's less about the precautions you're asking of him, and more about how often you're asking.", "NTA\n\nI feel like not locking the door is just a difference in growing up, but lying about it is too much of an AH move, since it will make you a bit nervous and that lying is just generally stupid and AH-like\n\nDid you go on tirades or yell at him whenever he forget something? If not, then you should be careful of him being a consistent liar.", "lady you need therapy. like 95% of the time he makes sure it's locked. like if you wanted to make sure it was locked so bad yu go check. you're paranoid and it's not going to get any better when it comes to the kid when he gets older. don't be one of them moms. just don't. you can't expect your husband to be on he same wave length when it comes to this stuff. its not healthy.", "NTA. It shouldn't be an issue making sure your wife and children feel safe in their home. It makes sense to ensure all doors are locked to prevent opportunistic thieves from entering.", "NTA. Let me preface this by saying I'm more like your boyfriend. Safety conscious but I'm more loose. My boyfriend is like you, just not quite as paranoid. We had a few talks about we handle each others apartments security when we stay at one of our places, I just adhere to his rules and he adheres to mine. I expect when we move in together we will use his security measures, since he wants his stuff to be safe to his standards and I understand that. Further, I did the math even though it's super unnecessary, but if the 5% are true and he goes in and out of the house twice a day that means the door stays unlocked once a week. I understand that you don't like that and insist he checks, and especially that he DOESN'T LIE ABOUT IT. I recommend to change your apartment door to one that can't be opened from the outside by not having a handle/only having a knob that can't be twisted or anything, then locking that door isn't explicitly necessary", "NTA. Your precautions are certainly not unreasonable. Your husband is being unfair by diminishing your concerns. It\u2019s basic safety! It only takes one chance happening for something to go horribly wrong.", "NTA. all of these things are pretty normal daily precautions. i've accidentally locked people out of their own house when i visit them, because my instinct from being a girl living alone is to immediately lock every outside door behind me. \n\nthat said, changing a person's mindset and habits is hard to do, and you can ask him to be as diligent about safety as you are, but you can't really get mad at him for not feeling it's as big of a priority as you do. \n\ninstead, maybe make it easier for you to take these precautions yourself. if you installed your security system yourself, i'm guessing it has an app? you can add things like security cameras and window sensors where you can set it and see the status from the app and there are other things you can install yourself, like a door lock you can check/lock from your phone so if it happens again, nobody has to get out of bed.", "NTA. These are, as you said in your title, *basic* safety precautions. You are not wrong to want doors locked, valuables out of sight, and a safety plan in place. That's not paranoid, that's smart.\n\n\"Safe\" neighborhoods get hit by crime as well as \"unsafe\". I suspect they are robbed more often because people there have better stuff, and they do tend to be laxer in their safety precautions (because they're \"safe\").", "NTA, i would be livid if my partner didnt care about my concerns to this point. Especially since my area has had a lot of car break ins lately. You arent asking too much, you're asking for the bare minimum imo.", "I\u2019ll probably get downvoted to oblivion, but I say YTA.\n\nYou are paranoid, not him. If you want to lock the doors, then you do it. If he does it 95% of the time, then let it go and simply ensure that it\u2019s locked yourself. \n\nAs long as he doesn\u2019t leave your valuables in plain sight, only his, then it\u2019s not your issue.\n\nMy husband and I are somewhat similar. He\u2019s paranoid, I\u2019m not. I\u2019ll placate him by locking the doors, but I gotta tell you, it\u2019s just not the first thing on my mind and I forget, a lot. If he locks it, that\u2019s fine, but if he continuously nagged me to do it, I would become very frustrated over it. \nL", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's ok to do that if the car is in a locked garage; out on street parking though? Completely different story and a very quick and easy way to get your stuff stolen.\n\nHe is an AH for lying about locking the door though. That's not good enough behaviour from him.

Leaving valuables in an otherwise locked garage doesn't seem particularly risky.  Pepper spray and safe room strategies in an otherwise quiet neighborhood seems a bit unnecessary too - unless there is a rash of home invasions I haven't heard about.

These are valid concerns, especially if you live in the United States.

Chores, hobbies, even little things like leaving light-switches on or flipping them off.

I wasn't raised to care how the tupperware was stacked, but okay, I'll try to pay attention in the future. I know you're trying to turn every light off, so okay, I'll just do a last sweep of the house before we leave and turn off any you forget without comment. \n\nIt sounds like you haven't gotten there with security practices. Rather than saying, \"I don't remember if I locked the door, but I'll go check,\" he lies. Instead of just saying, \"My bad, I'll try to remember in the future,\" he complains. Instead of trying to comply with a basic safety measure like not keeping goods out in the open in a car, he is incredulous that someone can break into a garage. \n\nIt's also not like you're insisting on unreasonable or extreme safety measures. Locked doors are basic. Having a discussion of what to do in an emergency is common sense. If you're already closing the house most of the time, and he can't even afford to check one door when you specifically ask, he's obviously the AH.

First is are you sure that he intentionally lied about locking the door or did he just thought he did?  Like you said 95% of the time he locks the door so it is possible he just thought he did and was too tired to get out of bed to check.  You seem to be just assuming he intentionally left the door unlocked.\n\nSecond you mention he gets annoyed anytime you mention your break in plan.  How often are you going over this plan?  If you have brought it up a couple times in the last few months that is reasonable but if you insist to go over it every few days that can be very annoying.\n\nThird what is this DIY security system you installed?  Is it something you bought online or did you pull a Home Alone on your house and set up make shift traps?\n\nOverall I do think you are being a little overly paranoid about your safety.  I mean you were too scared of your own home at night to simply check if the door was locked, even if it was for your own peace of mind.  Unless there are people banging against your windows all the time there really shouldn't be a rational reason for you to be afraid to walk around your own home in the dark to make sure the doors are locked.  \n\nI myself am very mindful of my home's safety.  I still live at home with the majority of my family and my brother constantly leaves the doors unlocked to our house.  We have talked to him several times about it but he doesn't care.  So I go around the house before I got to bed and make sure all the doors are closed and locked tight.  If your own fears are preventing you from making sure your house is safe yourself and assume your husband is intentionally endangering you when it doesn't appear that way, you should really see a professional about them.  Right now I am leaning towards YTA.", "I offer a different perspective. By doing all these things, you're telling him you don't feel safe. You're telling him that you don't depend on him to protect you. That feels like disrespect to him, so he'll likely get upset.

In ancient times, the species flourished because of it, so it's probably something he's not even aware of. Perhaps you could appreciate it when he does do something? Instead of taking it personally and getting upset at mistakes, why not appreciate the many times he does something right? How would you feel if someone you cared about got all upset at something missed, that you did at their insistence, that felt unloving? \n\nJust an idea, I'm not attacking or discounting anyone, it's an idea for OP's consideration, to see if she wants to try something new that might reduce the fights.", "ESH but he sucks me\n\nYou are being overly safe.\n\nHe is not being safe enough (leaving valuables in car in garage is not great, leaving doors unlocked 5% of the time is not great)\n\nHe is also downplaying your concerns when really, it would be easy to just listen and be safer to make you feel better.

When I was a kid, my parents would often leave valuables in the car as well and saw nothing wrong with it.

Having your unoccupied car broken into isn't an issue of personal safety. It's annoying, and costs money, but you aren't personally at risk. Most home invasions happen when homes are unoccupied, because they're people looking for things to steal, not looking to hurt people. That's not to say you shouldn't take basic security precautions, like locking doors and even having cameras, but having him repeatedly go over a safe room plan is a bit much. Get smart locks.

A window is also an exit, and a broken ankle from going out of a second floor window is better than burns and smoke inhalation. Tying bedsheets together into a rope with a sling at the end and using it to slowly lower your baby to the ground is a good option so you don't have to drop your child out of the window to someone else. Talk about if a fire were to happen at night, who is going to find an escape route and who is going to get the child. The person finding the escape route can yell where the fire is located and if you can use a door or window to get out. You'll also need to have the rough discussion of putting your child first even if it means leaving your partner in the home. It's heartbreaking to think about, but necessary to discuss.\n\nWhen your child is older, teach them about fire hazards (leaving hair curlers/straighteners on, leaving the oven on, putting things on radiators) and to immediately alert an adult if they see it.

I was always told that most crimes are crimes of opportunity, so why are you giving them the opportunity?? I feel zero sympathy for the people who go on my city's Facebook crying that someone stole their laptop from their unlocked Porsche. OP, you're not being paranoid at all, you're being *a smart adult*. Plus, lying to you is especially messed up for him to have done, even if he does (incorrectly) think you're being dramatic.

No break ins or burglaries). We still always locked up when we left and when we went to bed, because there\u2019s no sense in not being safe. In my current neighborhood I had someone break into my car in my own garage just last week and I didn\u2019t even have anything valuable in there, just an empty work bag. A laptop or wallet is just asking for trouble.", "NTA\n\nIt's common sense to do the things you mentioned. The most valuable thing that is left in my car is when I forgot to grab up my to go cup.

We have motion lights as well as video doorbells. I also never broke my dogs of barking when someone comes to the porch. \n\nYour husband needs to look at the crime statistics for your area. You should be able to get that from your local PD.

I have a lot of similar plans. Also ppl break into cars all the time; you shouldn't leave valuables in there. We recently had someone in our neighborhood walk around and check all the car doors.

So not locking the door is always weird to me. House and Car. I'ma say NTA. I also have fire escape plans. Lmao. GL. Sorry your husband is a being a butthead about it.", "NTA I agree with him that if the car is in your garage and the garage is locked it doesn't much matter what's left in the car.

It's ok to worry about normal things, but you also can't turn your fears into EVERYONE's fears. That can get right out of hand in a hurry. Locking doors is pretty basic, though, and as people have said, insurance claims are made vastly more difficult to impossible when the doors were left unlocked. The security system helps there, though, but nonetheless, thieves will often prioritize easy targets for obvious reasons.\n\nSo I think you're being rational about some of those concerns, though I do suspect you have a bunch of anxiety that you possibly brush off as \"I'm just cautious!\". Nonetheless, the lying about it is a no go, no matter the situation, because it prevents you from making decisions for yourself.

He wants to come home and relax and not worry about locking every last door. You are disturbing his peace for no reason. \n\nEven your security system is an annoyance. Maybe your husband wants to go to the kitchen in the middle of the night. Why should he have to disable several layers of security just to walk around in his own house?

If nineteen people had their garages broken into and all their gear stolen, well, your husband is going to feel pretty silly!  In my old neighborhood cops would come out and give you a safety evaluation, which is really nice.\n\nI'd also consider some therapy.  It's not that you are out of whack.

I think we all know too that OP's husband is going to be SO SURPRISED and lose his shit if something gets stolen too.\n\nSome things you can't do much about, like leaving valuables in a car.  But you do want to have the discussion where you very clearly state that he will be SOL if his shit gets stolen - he gets to replace them with his own funds or go without, and will need to be responsible for damages if/when that happens.  I wouldn't let him use any of your things because he clearly DGAF.  He should also consider that say, he leaves something valuable in his car & it gets stolen.  In many cases, insurance will not reimburse (or will do so at a reduced rate) when he leaves the doors unlocked.  \n\nSo.  Door locking.  You can buy electronic locks and set them to lock at certain intervals.  These are great because you can track who locks/unlocks the door and you don't have keys to find.  We set ours to lock at 30 seconds, and it's been great with a toddler especially.  Switching a door lock is surprisingly easy too, and there are lots of great tutorials online.  Having a video doorbell is great for not only seeing who comes to your door, but it acts as a deterrent too. There are things like door chimes as well, so you hear who is coming in & out of the house, regardless of whether it's locked up (also great with a toddler, ours is an escape artist).\n\nAs far as planning for a B&E, it's prudent to have a plan, but be mindful that you're on the side of being prudent, and not in a constant state of fear.  I know that once I had a child, I worried so much more, and not always in the most rational of ways.  \n\nThe best action you can have is to not be an easy target, but you should be doing this at an appropriate level for the risk involved.

I left a note on the dash saying the car was unlocked but there was nothing inside. (after repairing a broken window and a broken door lock) \n\nNone of your requests are unreasonable ESPECIALLY with a child in the house.  I like to take my car keys to bed so I can hit the panic alarm if needed, along with house alarm. (one alarm might be a misfire, two will get attention)", "You should let your husband know that having a garage doesn't mean his stuff is safe. My friend was bringing in groceries and had the garage door open. In the five minutes between leaving the car and putting away the groceries, someone came into the garage and stole his gun out of the glove box. This was in a nice neighborhood during broad daylight. The guy was caught, but the gun hasn't been recovered. Criminals are getting slick when it comes to robberies.", "You sound like me. I feel like I am overly paranoid about things, and I grew up with an overly paranoid poverty raised mother who was scared of her own shadow. Too scared to learn to drive, scared to go out, scared to let us go out, and some of her rubbed off on me.\n\nI am always double and triple checking things, sometimes as I approach my car when finished shopping, I will not unlock it and will walk up to it and pull on the door to make sure I did in fact lock it to test myself to make sure these things are always second nature. \n\nI highly suggest getting a smart door lock, a good one. It's helped me a lot, when I get worried or am rushing out the door, it will auto lock in 2-3 minutes. I never have to bring keys, I also have a doorbell camera, a 364 camera by the garage door, a indoor camera that we use aimed at the front door hallway when we go on trips. \n\nI am always the one pointing out safety or logical flaws that could pose danger. For example I had a kitty, who passed on Sunday tragically. My in laws used to let her in the backyard unattended and she's an indoor girl, so I'd always be hyper paranoid she'd get out and I would constantly remind my partner, hey she can jump the height of our fence, if she sees a squirrel she will chase it, so go watch her or bring her back in. I always thought I was the crazy one, but in reality safety is just not the forefront of others mind", "I agree with what you're saying, but one thing i do want to point out is why some people leave their doors unlocked. Especially if they dont have a garage some people may leave the doors unlocked so they dont come out in the morning to find their windows smashed, however that does require not leaving valuables in the car.", "Garages can be broken into, and the temperature can still be an issue, especially for electronics.

Especially depending on the area and weather", ">Everything you\u2019ve numbered in your post are things I do without thinking about them\n\nI was thinking the same, those are all things I do as well as a safety precaution. OP is far from paranoid.\n\nLook, I have a friend who even checks all the windows in the attic every time she goes out twice(!!)  before she leaves the house. Even though knowing that they are never opened in the first place and in fact have been locked since they were placed a couple of years ago. That's problematic behaviour! (She is in therapy for her severe anxiety and what I also assume her OCD).\n\nBut all the things OP mentioned in their post, is just basic safety measures.", "Life in general is scary, you don't want to put yourself in danger. OPs husband needs to get a clue here, he's acting like the most precious things in his life aren't in danger with his behavior!", "NTA - I grew up in a relatively safe suburban area. This has nothing to do with your family's history and him using that to make you doubt yourself is disturbing. What you are asking is entirely reasonable and normal. I keep my doors locked, don't leave valuables in the car, and have an alarm without having a difficult background. Your home/car insurance can and likely will deny coverage if you leave valuables out and don't lock doors. Especially with a young kid, locking the door is important - there are so many instances of toddlers just walking out of their house and into the road while parents are sleeping or on the toilet.", "Very good point! It's especially important to get in the habit of locking doors before the baby is mobile.", "I'd guess that DIY security system is something like Simplisafe.

I live in a highly urban area and car break-ins are crimes of opportunity.  If the criminal doesn't see the opportunity then they're not just going to break into random garage.", "Then he's **not** an amazing partner and person. Empathy is a bare minimum.

I do want to say, if you can, do yourself a favor and get a lock near the top of the door that's really out of reach. 3ish year old me figured out how to grab a chair and unlock a deadbolt and still managed to get out lol.", "Can't imagine why you're single", "I'm a little more sympathetic, but still agree with others that you need therapy to overcome any fears that actively hinder your life.

You're a grown adult. The previous owner's ghost stories should not stop you from locking your doors at night.", "Sure, the chances are small. But they still happen.

I can see how some may not care about it much, i just know for myself personally it would bother me a fair bit, and the way i see it, if he really cares about her, he should be willing to do small things like this to make her feel safe and happy.
