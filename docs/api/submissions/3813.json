It's rude to interrupt someone who is actively spending time with their partner to ask for a minor request that you could fulfill yourself. \n\n2. It's irrelevant that BIL actually went. OP still went out of her way to ask because she deemed his time with his partner was less important than her desire for freaking cake.\n\n3.

She also could have gone with him so they were still spending time together.

No matter how much you crave it, you could have lived without chocolate cake. A craving is not an essential. And if you or your partner can\u2019t get it, that doesn\u2019t give you the right to expect others to. His gf is right, he\u2019s not your errand boy.

Oh, you can't, as I didn't. ;)\nShe's fine to ask. As he's fine to say no. As long as she doesn't start throwing fits or forcing him into it like you incorrectly imply she did, it's not an issue.

He\u2019s a grown adult who could\u2019ve said no. Asking him the question wasn\u2019t entitled.
