You don't have to suck it up and do everything yourself as if you weren't pregnant. You are allowed to be pampered and be taken care of. You have the right to decide where you keep trying to stay independent and where you decide to ask for help.

I get that pregnancy cravings aren't an emergency but BIL could have said no if he didn't want to do it. She's not an AH for asking a favour.

He was not \"actively spending time with his partner,\" they were just existing in the same space. He spends most of his time at his brother's and will occasionally bring his girlfriend with him, where they just lounge about for hours doing nothing. And OP is rude for asking a single question, in her own home? Are you kidding? And even if it was a date, so what? It's OP's house! If my brother showed up at my apartment with his girlfriend and told me they were having an hours-long date in my living room and it would be the height of rudeness to talk to them even once, I'd laugh him all the way out of the city.\n\n2. OP only asked if BIL would mind going *once he was free.* He decided to leave right away, which means HE is the one who decided that her desire for cake was more important than hanging out in front of the television. His choice. And since he's had no problem refusing requests in the past, there's no reason to believe that this choice wasn't made freely. So of course it's relevant that he went. He didn't consider it an imposition.\n\n3. OP couldn't do it herself, as she can't travel for medical reasons.

If that's even true bc the post just says that they were busy and spouses being together at the same place doesn't equal date night or just watching a movie/doing something together doesn't mean it's a date, it's just normal life. I ask my friends, relatives etc all the time something and I can't know beforehand if they have something else going on or not. It's on them to tell me that no I can't bc I'm spending time with my gf or I'm busy.  Only way op would be TA if she would have insisted BIL to get her the cake even after he said no. And at least what I read, the post doesn't say anything other than that she asked BIL and he agreed.\n\nPlus if op didn't insist I think the hate should be pointed at BIL for not saying no. It's his job to think about his gf and his job to think how to prioritize things in his life. If I ask my friend to meet and he happens to be on a date with his gf but he still leaves and meets me, why would I be the asshole if I'm asking my friend something not knowing he has something else to do and he decides that yes meeting with my friend is nicer the date can wait?\n\nIdk if there was some additional info on the comments from op that made her TA but based on the post alone I think she's NTA.", "NTA. \n\nBIL could have said no or waited till his gf was gone or brought her along.\n\nAnd IDC what other commenters are saying, the gf was in YOUR house watching YOUR tv. HER bf made the choice to leave. If she wanted to pick a fight, she should've picked it with her bf. Not the hormonal pregnant woman whose house she apparently stays at frequently.\n\nHonestly it's funny to me how many people are defending gf. I sure as shit wouldn't let someone talk like that to me in my own home. You think I'm an asshole? Great! Quit coming to my house.", " NTA - there\u2019s nothing wrong in asking.

He might have asked his gf to go with him and call it an adventure and while there were at it get a snack or too. Or the gf could have offered to go as well.

I just thought it was hilarious that people who have probably never experienced a pregnancy cravings have so many opinions about it \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I mean if it's consensual whatever, but that is an oddly specific comment.", "Pregnant 3 times and I would never ask someone to do this.\n\nYTA", "I bet she thinks everyone finds her pregnancy entitlement to be adorable. \n\nWho is going to tell her?  lol", "Some women act like they are the only people who have ever been pregnant \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Let me guess. You were this entitled when you were pregnant", "Exactly. I'm a people pleaser too but that's no one else's problem but mine.", "Yeah lol.  Unless it's meant that the \"time together\" that OP interrupted was all of them collectively hanging out.  Not some intimate BIL/GF alone time.  It's the only way I can reconcile those two things haha.\n\nEdit - Yeah nah.  Going back and re-reading it, she was \"annoyed at me for interrupting ***them***\"  So I don't know what the fuck either lol.  Why the hell they go to OP's house for alone time?", "If OP's husband was in a conference call then it sounds like they were hanging out and moved into the next room to politely wait on the phone call to be over which is what I do when my boyfriend has to take a conference call when we are together. It also makes sense as to why BIL left as if he was already waiting then he figured he might as well do it now. GF was upset because she was enjoying spending time with him and likely felt upset that they were already moved over and now she's stuck here by herself with who she perceives as a rude host which makes her more mad. The real question is if this craving is so bad why have they not stocked up on mixes?", "She didnt know bils gf was annoyed until after he left. Why didnt she say something beforehand? Thats not ops problem she didnt speak up till after the fact. Bil was cool with it gf didnt say anything till he left.", "But it's not OP's responsibility to make her BIL prioritize his girlfriend over her.\n\nIn a comment, she said she asked him to go *at his convenience*, and HE chose to get up right away and get the cake.\n\nAsking somebody to do you a favor isn't an asshole move. It's what friends and family and loved ones do for one another. Everyone is treating OP like she *demanded* this of her BIL, but nothing she posted Implies that.", "But if BIL was happy to do it\u2014 OP isn\u2019t the problem. It\u2019s a communication and expectation problem between BIL and his gf at that point.", "Yo the level of honesty in this reply is A+ hahaha.", "Idk my doctor told me I should eat what I craved during pregnancy as long as it wasn\u2019t dangerous. I really did struggle the whole way through but thankfully gave birth to a healthy baby. But regardless, she could have waited for her significant other to be done with the phone call. I don\u2019t think there is any world where I would feel comfortable bothering in-laws or relatives for cake. I did have to call my husband a few times to help me get the dogs back to the house while I was walking them though because I started vomiting again and couldn\u2019t stop. Good times \ud83e\udd2e", "I think people would have more sympathy if she said she couldn\u2019t drive vs. her husband telling her not to. \n\nMost pregnant people can drive and she didn\u2019t specify any medical reason why she cannot.", "Yeah but it doesn't say that. It says her husband just doesn't want her driving at night.  So sounds like she should either drive herself or inconvenience her husband who made the stupid rule then anyone else", "That is so shitty. I was so sick through most of my pregnancy that whenever something did sound good. My husband was so excited to get or make that food. But it was never a \u201cI need you to do this for me\u201d. He would literally ask me everyday what I thought I could eat. It was hard too because the store just simply didn\u2019t have what I wanted for months. They still had trouble getting inventory. But I never asked for him to drop what he was doing and get something for me. It got to the point where I could at least do French fries and lemonade so that was safe.", "Hell is other people.", "It's too people-y out there ... shudder...", "I would be more sympathetic in that circumstance. I know people who've barely fit in their car and felt uncomfortable or unsafe reaching the pedals and steering wheel once they fit their pregnant belly in. I know people who've felt unsafe driving because they're so close to the steering wheel it could be unsafe for the baby if they were in an accident and the airbag deployed.\n\nI'm sympathetic to both those reasons, or medical reasons, but not \"my husband says no\" like she has no say in what she can and can't do.", "Not if they're in your house though??? I mean he\u2019s sitting there using the cable OP pays for, the electricity OP pays for, and most likely the water OP pays for. Jfc sounds like OP is doing BIL a favor and in return he does favors when it\u2019s in his means. It\u2019s not like she called him up in the middle of the night to run errands. They\u2019re family asking family for favors doesn\u2019t make you the AH same thing as saying no doesn\u2019t make you the AH it\u2019s the response to either that can. If he doesn't  want to be bothered when spending time with his SO why was he not in a private area? Ultimately it\u2019s up to BIL to decide if OP was an AH and clearly nothing by him shows he didn\u2019t think NTA.", "This has to be my favorite response", "Did she know she was interrupting something? She asked a question, he could have said no and she would have chosen another option. It isn't entitled to ask for help.", "If OP's husband doesn't think it's safe for her to drive right now, she's pretty much got to rely on others to get things for her. This feels like an ESH situation to me. I've been pregnant, sometimes you don't get to satisfy that craving and you gotta move on.", "That errand boy comment feels a certain way yeah.", "I've asked someone to make a quick run similar to this when I was just tired or not feeling well. I've also done it for other people. And I'm not even talking about being pregnant/can't drive. I don't understand what the big deal is.\n\nAlso, has anyone thought about the fact that BIL has his own place but chooses to stay at OP's? I'm not saying he should be the on call errand boy, but a small favor like this occasionally should be NBD.\n\nNTA.", "I was considering going out today. But based on this research, I'm staying in.", "I don't know what's up with this comments but CLEARLY NTA. Like come on guys, she asked her BIL and he said yes. She didn't throw a tantrum, didn't expect her BIL to do it, she just asked. Since when is that A H behavior? And I feel like the girlfriend should be mad at BIL if she wanna be mad at someone.", "Yeah YTA and weird too... who asks a brother in law for cravings..the attitude of wanting to be served. Get the stupid cakes in bulk girrrrrl", "YTA. Pregnancy is not a disease. You can get your own cake or not have cake, nothing is going to happen to neither you nor your baby either way.", "YTA. Your husband is TA. You\u2019re pregnant not an invalid.", "YTA.\n\nI\u2019ve birthed two kids and can confidently say that pregnancy does NOT give you a pass for being entitled, demanding or rude - nor should it.\n\nIf there\u2019s one person on earth who you can ask extra favours from while pregnant, it\u2019s the one who shot his spermatozoa into you. NOT HIS BROTHER.\n\nWtf.", "You\u2019re pregnant, not made of glass. Buy your own food. YTA and so is your husband.", "Geezuz, when did helping a family member become another snowflake  inconvenience.  Unbelievable!\n\nYes, this is the day in age where people have shown little to no interest in helping others. Lol, get the app and walk it off... \n\nAssuming this is a date, it's odd she didn't go with him considering spending time and keeping him company matters.", "Do we know if OP knew he was on a date?? If I call someone I don\u2019t know what they are doing and I assume that if they are unavailable they won\u2019t answer. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s an AH for asking. BIL could have said \u201cI can\u2019t right now\u201d", "Making requests isn't an AH move. BIL could have said no and said he was busy, but he didn't.\n\nUnless OP yelled at him after he said no, I don't see how OP was rude to make a request", "I live with my wife. One could say I\u2019m \u201cconstantly on a date\u201d. Does this give me grounds to always refuse to help people out?", "Yeah. People act like pregnancy cravings are a life threatening emergency that everyone needs to drop whatever they\u2019re doing to accommodate.  \n\n                 \nA.: Get it yourself. Your husband shouldn\u2019t decide whether or not you\u2019re able to drive.                 \nB.: Or, as someone said, there are plenty of delivery options.                         \nC.: You could make sure you\u2019re stocked up on the stuff you crave.                       \nD.: Or hey, just wait. Jeez.\n\n\nYTA.", "Seriously  like chill on a couch and wait ?", "Legit though \ud83e\udd74", "Doesn\u2019t matter if he was \u201cjust watching tv\u201d. He was spending time with his partner. What was op doing? Nothing probably so she could\u2019ve gone to get it herself. If her BIL was already out shopping and she asked him to pick her something up that would be different.", "Don't know why\"just watching TV\" like his down time is less important than anyone else's", "Netflix and chill is a date mate.", "A wilderness EMT??", "Hell I\u2019m CF and I hate when people act like pregnancy/having kids earns them special treatment, but all she did was ask. He could have said no or later or whatever. We don\u2019t know the whole story and if it\u2019s a pattern or someone\u2019s making him feel obligated then maybe but for asking, NTA.", "Agreed. OP is NTA. It sounds like BIL was happy to oblige. He could have said, \"No\". It seems like it was only the gf who had a problem with it. She could've gone with him.", "\u201cOh death please...no, cake! Cake! Cake! Sorry...\u201d.         \n\n\u201cAaaah! Aaah, you said death first, aaaah, death first!\u201d     \n\n\u201cI meant cake!\u201d    \n\n\u201cOh, _alright._ You\u2019re lucky I\u2019m Church of England.\u201d", "OP needs a few mug cake recipes up her sleeve. I Am A Food Blog has a chocolate mug cake recipe that's really easy, delicious, and uses stuff most people have in their pantry. I'm pregnant, love cake, and my SO is not big on sweets, so this is how I handle my cake cravings! Is it too early for cake?", "That\u2019s understandable but the reason given by OP was \u201cmy husband thinks I shouldn\u2019t be driving\u201d. I gave birth at 34 weeks with my first and I was put on bed rest at 35 weeks with my second so I totally get late term pregnancy dangers but again, OP did not indicate anything other than her husbands wishes.", "It isn't entitled to ask someone to do you a favor though. It sounds like the BIL had no problem helping her, it's just his gf who was mad.", "I\u2019m 8.5 months pregnant and if I was regularly getting dizzy and lightheaded I\u2019d think it would be moronic to drive around at night", "YES!", "Perfect way to put it.", "What kind of car? I had a twin pregnancy and had no issues (Honda accord) and I drove myself to the hospital when my water broke\u2026.at 4am on a Monday.", "r/subsithoughtifellfor", "\"Other people\" are overrated. I'll pass.", "I\u2019ve had my husband express that he doesn\u2019t feel safe with me driving when I had dizzy spells when pregnant. The spells weren\u2019t super frequent but it was enough to worry him. It\u2019s an understandable concern. \nWe don\u2019t know the context behind why he doesn\u2019t feel safe about it. Could be a legitimate reason.", "Yeah and she think\u2019s because she\u2019s pregnant that means her craving must be satisfied ASAP BECAUSE a pregnant woman can\u2019t crave something for more then a few seconds without some action /s. I\u2019m currently pregnant and sometimes I crave things and life happens and I don\u2019t get said craving- I\u2019m alive and well and so is the baby. No one is going to die for her just waiting the 15-30 mins it would take for hubby to get off the phone. The saddest part to me is her \u201cI don\u2019t drive because hubby thinks I shouldn\u2019t \u201c what?! You\u2019re a grown ass adult about to bring life into the world and you can\u2019t even get your own damn cake?  lol this is crazy to me!! Op is TA.", "He is a grown man though, he can\u2019t just tell her no? If he had said no and she pushed I would be full on OP being TA but simply *asking* a favor isn\u2019t horrible. With the information we have it doesn\u2019t sound like the BIL cared it sounds like his gf cared. Now this is what we *know* by what she told us and not everything so maybe more to this story but with that simple explanation NTA", "Am out now. People suck.", "Yeah, I braved a cheap store for some Xmas crap and won't be doing that again until next year!"]}
