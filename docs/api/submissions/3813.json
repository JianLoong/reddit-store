It's rude to interrupt someone who is actively spending time with their partner to ask for a minor request that you could fulfill yourself. \n\n2. It's irrelevant that BIL actually went.

Like I really feel like it was more than \u201chey can you get me cake?\u201d  \u201c yeah sure\u201d BIL leaves gf and gets cake. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if op used her pregnancy to guilt her BIL into getting her cake", "Question was if she is AH for asking. Do you have issue with understanding the question???", "the girlfriend was upset. That's the issue here, not whether or not BIL was ok with it. \n\nWe don't even know whether or not he was because we're not given the info on how the conversation went down. \n\nWhy is the girlfriend's time not important? Maybe she's a really busy woman and doesn't get to spend much time with her boyfriend. Interrupting that time is then a huge dick move.", "Because the AITA question was about her asking him, not whether or not he fulfilled the request. I\u2019m 7 months pregnant and cravings are not life or death. She could have easily waited until her husband was off the phone call and had him go get the cake. If I were the BILs gf I would be mad too if some other woman interrupted our alone time over cake. Being pregnant doesn\u2019t make you entitled to other peoples time. And I cannot stress this enough *she could have waited for the husband to get off the phone call* OP is YTA.", "in the title, OP asks if the is TA for interrupting them to ask BIL. his decision to do it follows the question, sure, but it's out of the scope. and yes. OP. YTA", "Not this women clearly! She\u2019s not even allowed to use a car by herself! \nAnd once again you ignore OPs question! She didn\u2019t ask if he was also the AH, she asked if she was and AH for purposely interrupting BIL date for something completely unnecessary. There was also clearly a time preassure set because she coudnt wait for her husband to be done! \nHe\u2019s responsible for going and she\u2019s responsible for making a dumb request!", "In the comments she mentions he spends so much time staying at their place so he basically lives with him. His gf was there and they were watching TV, sounds like a as per usual situation, so a non-event.", "I feel the exact same! Running little errands like this are often more fun than watching tv. If it\u2019s a serious show they\u2019re binging then they\u2019re taking a break to get some fresh air and maybe some snacks. The gf is TA.", "I have a cake guy.", "Yes!", "The original post didn\u2019t say anything about dizzy spells, that comment was posted after I wrote this. And even then, it still sounds like the main reason she doesn\u2019t drive is because HE says no. So yeah, I stand by my original sentiment.", "Right? I have been pregnant before. Twice. But I find the entitlement of the pregnant people I often read about here on AITA absolutely inexcusable and astounding. And also a bit like an insult to other pregnant people who don't use their pregnancy to get away with horrible behavior.", "How else would one eat Nutella? As a kid that was the only chocolate in the house. I literally never ate it any other way and preferred my toast with just butter or maybe peanut butter.", "Or he is just a good soul and wanted to help OP out. It's just the girlfriend being annoyed as far as we know. If they are not visibly busy with a romantic date or something OP is allowed to ask and the BIL is old enough to tell her that they are busy right now if that's the case, so why should OP assume he wasn't okay with it?", "Yip! YTA. I\u2019m currently 38 weeks pregnant and craved chocolate cake like there\u2019s no tomorrow. So I either got off my ass and got it, or went without. You\u2019re pregnant, not physically disabled and unable to drive.", "I mean, the pregnancy itself can be pretty fragile - but not for getting chocolate cake.", "I agree with you but pregnancies are like people: every one is different.\n\nI have a friend who always describes herself as a sturdy peasant. Works outdoors 8, 10, sometimes 12 hour days. Always the first to a physical challenge, climbs rocks, surfs, skates, skis. She ended up on bed rest and had to have a C section because her pelvis was not big enough for a (normal sized) baby.\n\nI am often perceived as ladylike, though I think it's social anxiety. I am small boned, annoyed by athletics, and I like to wear dresses. I was rudely healthy both pregnancies and gave birth to a 10 pound baby after four hours of labor.\n\nYou don't get to choose how pregnancy will take you.\n\nThat being said, you can eat cake but you have to get it for yourself.", "That sounds like such a great and pleasant camping trip! That's awesome", "Fully agree.", "I don't get this entitlement some women have during pregnancy that others need to cater to all their whims. \n\nDrive yourself.   Make a cake.   Order from a delivery service.   Wait.   Don't have cake.   All adult alternatives to interrupting someone's day.\n\nETA and yes,  I've been pregnant, 4 times", "Seriously lol, I've never heard of more weird, often entitled behavior, from pregnant women than on this sub. It's wild! YTA.", "Sometimes Doctors tell you not to drive, maybe the pregnancy is high risk or other things are going on. Not saying that's the case here, but there are some times where driving restrictions happen due to pregnancy.", "I'm a huge people pleaser too. It's really hard to say no. Doesn't make OP the AH to ask, though.", "Is hanging out at your brother in laws house a romantic evening?", "Isn\u2019t it weird that BIL and his gf were visiting but hanging out in a different room and considering it \u201ctime together\u201d? I can\u2019t get my head round that", "Exactly! All op did was ask. He's an adult who can make his own decisions. Gf should have brought up any feelings she had about HIS choice with him", "Why is that disdain for pregnant women?\n\nIs chocolate cake craving a life-or-death situation? If it isn't, she has a couple of choices she could go with, and if she couldn't, then she could ask BIL.\n\n1. She could order takeaway from takeaway app.\n2. She could wait for her husband to finish his call and ask him to get it. \n\nShe is human, not an animal who cannot control their cravings and will go on a rampage if she doesn't get what she wants.", "She can't do it herself. And chilling watching TV isn't \"actively doing something else.\"", "I mean, instead of waiting for her husband to finish his call, she had BIL go out to get her cake. Pregnancy cravings are a thing, but I didn\u2019t know that every single one of them had to be satisfied.", "So my choice is \"...or death\"?", "Either way a couple was spending time together an both weren\u2019t okay with it.", "This. Like if you actually look at the science, there is also no evidence whatsoever that cravings are actually pointing to you needing something. Current research suggests it's literally just your brain's pleasure centre wanting stimulation, so it tries to make you eat something that will trigger it. Hence why people tend to crave foods that aren't good for them, but will absolutely trigger the pleasure centre - like chocolate cake. \n\nYou're not supposed to *give in* to those cravings. And like even in the rare cases where there *is* a physical cause for the craving - for example, iron deficiency - there is no universe where OP actually needs to eat chocolate cake.", "If there was a real medical reason, OP would tell us instead of just \"my husband doesn't want me to drive.\" Like, he's not her father. And she's the pregnant one. If there was a real risk, she would also want to avoid driving, and she wouldn't explain it to other people as \"my husband doesn't want me to.\"\n\nAs for being too big or there being snow on the roads- those things would be true during the day and she clearly makes the point that she can't drive \\*at night.\\*\n\nThe way OP talks about it is weird. Either she's lying and using it as an excuse to not go out and get it herself, or hubby is in a gray area in terms of making decisions on her behalf. It just feels off to me the way she talks about it. But that's just me.\n\nI've just never heard this \"pregnant women can't drive at night\" medical condition before.", "Exactly! She asked, and he agreed. He could have said no, or said in a little after they finished their TV show. Girlfriend could have gone with him and got cake for them to share while they watched TV after! \n\nThe gf just felt slighted and instead of doing something about that, like talking w/ her bf or going with him, she's lashing out at the easier target. A relationship she won't care about preserving as much. \n\nNTA", "This exactly a craving doesn't mean everyone has to rush out the second you have said craving", "It's interesting that you edited her post to make her sound more like an asshole. She didn't write \"I called his brother,\" she wrote \"I asked his brother.\" Because her BIL was at her house already. And she can't go out because she has dizzy spells and can't drive or travel alone. So in a world where BIL is hanging out at her house and she can't leave, she is not an asshole and/or ridiculous.", "Dizziness spells\n\n7 months pregnant\n\n10pm", "Because she was in OPs living room, watching OPs TV,  imho gf feelings are irrelevant", "Because she didn't say anything until BIL had already left the house.", "They definitely do not. No one, pregnant or not, needs cake of all things at 10 pm. She could have just went to bed, the baby will be fine without cake.", "I love you all lol, I need to watch that again", "I agree. My husband and I very rarely go out anymore because it's too peopley. We went out to lunch day before yesterday for the first time in about a month.\n\n OP YTA and very inconsiderate. You could have ordered some cake and had door dash deliver it.", "Same here. Our kids are a little older now and when they spend time at their grandparents house we usually stay home and play a scary video game or watch the movies we can't watch with the kids home. We often talk about going out but it's very expensive and we always have things I can cook.", "Op could have also just waited for her husband to finish up his call just because she has a craving doesn't mean everyone has to cater to it", "You can still be an AH just for asking, though. Just because someone *can* say no to some unreasonable request doesn't make the request itself unreasonable. Or even when the other person agrees to the request. In this case, the request was plainly rude, nothing complex or overtly unreasonable, but still rude, as OP was interrupting other people's personal time at night.\n\nAnd yeah, theres social pressure to help pregnant people, and given it could have turned into an unessisary argument with a relative, he could decide its just easier to go along with the request, even though he finds it rude.\n\nLiterally trying to say \"he didnt say no so that makes it ok\" is just a bad, circular argument.", "She was spending time with her S/O. Maybe she doesn't get to do that a lot. Why doesn't that matter just because she was watching someone else's tv?\n\nThat is such a weird explanation, btw. If she was watching her own TV would her feelings suddenly matter?", "There's not enough context to know if that's true or not. What we do know is that gf was upset about it.", "It\u2019s seed cake though!", "She would have, if BIL had said \"I'm doing something with gf, sorry!\". OP's ask wasn't entitled or unreasonable, it's a non-issue. Gf is being mad at op when she's really mad that bf agreed to it. Bf is a grown adult and could have said no if he didn't want to, and OP would have then gone to her husband after the call.", "At her home it would matter, but not her home, not her bf home, her felings doesn't matter", "Umm yes, if someone were to call up to another household all together where you have no idea what a person is doing to ask can you get me something is a different scenario than someone in the next room just watching TV.", "She's not \"just watching TV\" either, though. She's spending time with her S/O.", "Yep and I can\u2019t stand your presence", "Took me a second to realize the commenter above you is called insomniacakess and legit thought it was the name of a business.
