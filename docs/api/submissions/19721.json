{"id": 19721, "submission_id": "149tgt2", "title": "AITA For not giving back a leather jacket that was given to me over 10 years ago?", "selftext": "So, 10 years ago a friend of mine (lets call her Jackie) offered me a leather biker jacket that her grandfather had given her. The jacket was too big for Jackie and she doesn't wear stuff like that anyway. I was watching SOA at the time and Terminator 2 was one of my favorite movies growing up so I was ecstatic about the offer and immediately said yes. She said she was happy that someone was going to be wearing it instead of just sitting in the closet. On several occasions she said she was happy to see me wearing it.\n\nFor 10 years I wore this jacket. I would get excited to wear it when the weather got cold out. I became known to wear this jacket. I spent all of my 20s in it and into my 30s. I have made countless memories in it. Went through a 9 year relationship with it. Dozens of pictures of me in this jacket etc. I have owned more than twice as long as Jackie has and maybe even longer than her grandfather had at this point. For all intents and purposes it is my jacket now.\n\nJust recently Jackie's grandfather has been having health issues and he may not be with us for much longer. She asked for it back, stating that when she gave it to me she didn't understand the importance of him giving it to her and that it the only she has of his. It's not that I am unsympathetic to this but, I fail to see how having a jacket that she wont wear and will sit in her closet will make her grandfather passing easier. Also her grandfather hasn't passed yet and there's plenty of opportunity for her to ask for something else to remember him by. Maybe even something that she could actually use or keep on display.I told them that I feel bad about the situation but I don't want to give the jacket back because of my own sentimental attachment to the jacket both the memories I have made in it and the fact that she gave it to me.\n\nWhen I told her this her and her friend have told me that I am picking an aesthetic over her connection to her grandfather. I don't feel this way. I may have said yes to her offer of the jacket for aesthetic reasons but I want to keep it because of its sentimental value to me. I feel bad about wanting to keep it but, I also am angry that they seem to dismiss my feelings and memories I have made with this jacket minimizing it to just an aesthetic choice. So AITA I kind of feel that way but I also equally feel justified in keeping it.\n\nUPDATE: Me and this friend are not that close. She dated my brother and then later one of my friends. We became friends because of our mutual friends. But some of those friendships have become estranged and we have drifted apart. This message from her asking for the jacket back was the first contact from her in quite some time.

In any other situation, I would agree the jacket is yours and she should kick rocks.

It has become a symbol of your personal journey, with sentimental value that cannot be easily replaced. Returning the jacket would mean severing the emotional connection you have built with it over the years.\n\nMoreover, Jackie originally offered you the jacket because it didn't fit her and she had no use for it. By accepting the jacket, you were led to believe it was yours to keep and enjoy. It is unfair to suddenly demand its return after such a significant period of time.\n\nWhile I understand the sentimental value it holds for Jackie due to her grandfather's connection, it's important to consider the practicality of her request. If the jacket remains in her possession, it may simply end up sitting in a closet, unused and unappreciated. Does it even fit her? \n\nOn the other hand, you have actively worn and cherished the jacket, allowing it to continue its purpose and be a part of your life.\n\nUltimately, the decision should take into account the history and attachment you have developed with the jacket.

The fact that they accused you of valuing aesthetics over emotional attachment when you actually gave an emotionally attached reason also gives me pause. If there really was a significant meaning to the jacket this would have been the perfect time for her to tell you in detail. The fact she didn\u2019t leads me to believe that other commenters are correct in their assumption that she recently found out it\u2019s worth some serious cash. Or Grandpa asked about if.

It was a gift. What if she hadn\u2019t given it to OP? What if she had donated it or sold it online or something?? Then how would she get it back? Obviously I don\u2019t think she\u2019s wrong for wanting to hold on to it now that her grandpa is at risk of dying, but maybe she should hold on to something else of her grandpa?

It has been in your possession for a long time. \n\nI am wondering if her grandfather asked about it, and she is now panicking, trying to get it back for his sake because she doesn't want to admit she no longer has it.

She gave it away, thus it wasn't important. She can't wait a literal decade before feeling giver's remorse, especially if you've spent a good chunk of that decade actually in the jacket making memories. \n\nYou're not choosing an aesthetic over her grandpa.

It\u2019s a complete cheek for her to ask for it back.\n\nAs you said, her grandfather can easily pass on something else to her, something that\u2019s better suited to her.", "NAH you both are attached to this jacket for different reasons. She has come to recognize the significance of the jacket as her Grandfather's health deteriorates. It could also be her being older now and realizing things she didn't before. \n\n\nOn the other hand you have made your own memories with this jacket. It has become significant to you.\n\n\nThere is no easy solution. One means keeping the jacket but possibly losing the friendship that brought you the jacket. The other means returning it  but causing you to resent your friend for taking back the gift that was given to you.

What's to stop her asking for something else, like something he's worn sometime in the last 10 years?\n\nAnd OP has sentimental attachment. That can't be replaced with a new jacket any more than grandpa's one can be.\n\nThink about it - the friend's sentimentality is based on a single moment, that of her grandad giving it to her. OPs sentimentality is based on ten years of events wearing it.", "How is this tough? She has no actual attachment to it. He does and has had it for over a decade.

It was a lovely gesture and clearly my mom's friend was happy to give me another little piece of someone I don't get to physically have a connection to anymore. \n\nI think OP is a soft YTA because while the jacket has been in their possession for a long time, it's still the \\*nice\\* thing to do to help support a friend! Moreover, OP's comments about expecting Jackie to BUY a replacement jacket - when the original was a gift to OP - literally makes zero sense.

Unless her grandfather is asking for it and might not give her something else if she doesn't have the jacket. Jackie should replace it, not OP. I get not wanting to put out money for a jacket.

You cannot compare sentiment,  and OP is already being kind by saying if Jackie buys OP a duplicate Jackie can have the original back. Then both people can move forward happy.

She's only asking for it back because she will soon not have her grandfather, and so sentiment becomes a lot more important. I get that you love the jacket but you love it as a fashion item!

She won't notice, and probably won't wear it. That jacket is yours and you'll wear it, you should keep it.", "You can get a small detail changed on yours and then just tell her the jacket and the replacement you bought (for yourself) since you love that coat are on the hook by the door and she can just go grab hers and leave since the jacket is more important than your friendship to her. \n\n\nThen you aren't the one giving her the replacement, she might just be taking the wrong one or the right one. Leave it up to the universe. She might not notice the small detail is different, and if she does take the OG one and her grandfather notices the difference say you had to get them replaced due to damage. Feel free at that point to offer her the replacement with the correct buttons in exchange for the OG back. \n\n\nMake her the asshole. Tell other friends that you will consider forgiving her later if you can get past the fact she thinks a gifted jacket with 10 years of memories is more important than your friendship.

But that doesn't mean you don't get to be hurt by her choosing a jacket over your friendship and need a break to reevaluate things, and no one who is actually your friend can argue with that. \n\n\nAlso taking it back because it belongs to her grandfather isn't a good reason. When he dies I am sure she can get other keepsakes, or she can ask for other keepsakes now. When my grandparents died we were swimming in stuff to keep or donate. She might have actually asked for something and he might have asked what happened to the coat since he doesn't want stuff that holds memories for him that were expensive to be just given away or discarded because she decided she didn't want it a month later. A lot of people just don't want to think their stuff will all be donated or trashed or sold and nothing sentimental kept, so he could be thinking of this jacket as a test.

Asking out of the blue for the jacket may well have been quite hard for her, and your defensive response is making it harder. It doesn't matter if it'll stay in a closet. Carefully kept items of my deceased parents are in the closet - and I get to feel that connection to them when I want to.\n\nFrom OP's original post I was veering to e s h, but from your additional comments it's YTA.

But like I said I also feel justified in keeping it because I've had it more than twice as long as she did. I feel like trying to come up with a compromise is better than just saying no.", "Right lol. It's not sentimental value of this specific jacket for OP. This has become a borderline ransom situation now.\n\nIt's not a priceless sentimental piece if you can put a price tag of a few hundred bucks on it. For the friend, it's priceless. She would not be made whole having an identical jacket. That's such an obvious difference that OP has admitted to with their actions.", "I never said I would be just as happy with another one. I would absolutely miss this one. If I just gave it back I would also have some resentment. So i feel like this is a compromise where she gets exactly what she wants and I get some sort of gesture that she understands it meant something to me.", "You could ask the same thing of Little Miss Takesie-Backsies.", "Apparently not. Neither the friendship nor the hurt it will cause to someone who is grieving. \n\nOp is YTA because, while they're right that the jacket is theirs, they care more about the jacket than the grief of a friend.", "Your making a lot of assumptions. We don't know if her grandpa asked her about it. We don't know if its his last will which I highly doubt because apparently he had a bunch of leather jackets this is just the one this granddaughter got. Also Don't know if hes dying he could be here for many more years.", "I feel like I could make the same argument for her not having any sentimental attachment to it for giving it away. I would not give this jacket away to anyone I love it. I would not sell it to anyone either. The only reason I would except exchanging it for another exact copy of it is because of the situation.", "If the friend felt that strongly about the jacket she never would have given it away in the first place. I can maybe see changing her mind after a month or so, but 10 years? That's ridiculous. OP is NTA.", "This is true, but the fact is that OP is now just as attacked to the jacket as the friend's grandfather was when he gave it to his granddaughter. \n\nRecognizing the value of something a decade after it was gifted to you really sucks and it would definitely be a kindness to have it returned. That said, being unwilling to do so after so many years and memories doesn't make OP an asshole.", "I used to go to the Alternative Bring & Buy in Tufnell Park... so many second hand decent jackets! Near big cities you might be able to find subculture specific flea markets etc", "I've gotten lucky and only had good experiences, but tbh my main motivation is getting rid of my excessive wardrobe.", "Is it sentimental though if it\u2019s not the original jacket? If another copy from eBay will suffice, then it\u2019s safe to say this really is about the aesthetic.", "Oh sorry, I assumed you understood how sayings work. My bad", "No, it is still a gift. But human emotions are difficult, especially when the loss of a loved one is involved.  If you don't want to give it back, that's fine. But you got to understand that it will affect your friendship,  if you af least don't talk it out with empathy and understanding and see why they want this back so much. \n\nIf you can't at least see it from their perspective, then you were clearly not as close as you assumed, it doesn't matter if you were legally right or wrong", "I wasn\u2019t the person who made the comment you reacted to originally, but I\u2019d suggest some deep breaths", "That quote is generally applied towards things that have greater social consequence than clothing. But go off for a jacket, I guess.", "A world where people give a shit when their friends grandparents are dying, if I had to hazard a guess.", "But she gave it to him coz of FEELINGZ.. in your case your aunt sold it to new owners. While still shirty the new owners are at fault.\n\nThis dude though\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "The point is she's not out any money because if she needed a leather jacket she would have had to pay for it herself in the first place. Instead this friend did her a good deed and now she's asking for a good deed in return. To monetise it is so gross. It's the friend's grandfather's jacket and he's dying. OP is even talking about making the friend pay for a new one further up in the comments. Like??? She doesn't owe you money, you never spent yours in the first place???? If anything she's owed a thank you and the decent thing to do is return it.", "It's not just cause the jacket looks cool! They have a lot of fond memories associated with it. Mainly memories of how cool they looked in the jacket.", "Okay. I think you're being a greedy, selfish person but go ahead and ask them to pay for something you got for free because, \"You feel justified.\" Go off then, sis. You better make that granddaugher work for her elderly grandfather's items!! Wooo! /s.", "I think you are absolutely the AH for asking her to buy you a new jacket. You got a free jacket for ten years that she gave you as a favour and now she has to pay to replace it after she requested to get it back because of the sentimental value she now realises it holds for her grandfather.", "you're straight up TA if you keep this jacket regardless. yes you've made memories, but personally, those memories you made are not more important than that jacket being a physical part of her grandfather that she's about to no longer have in her life.\n\nI'd do the exact same thing in her situation. if I gave a friend something of my grandfathers on a whim thinking I wouldn't need it only for it to be the ONE thing I'd have left of him, I'd beg for that thing back just to have something in my hands to remember him by.\n\nand honestly? giving her the ultimatum of either not getting it back or buying you a replacemt jacket for the one that you never even paid a single cent for is 100% AH behavior. you didn't have to spend a dime on this, you got it for free. yes you've made memories with it since then, but are those truly more valuable and worthy than her grandfather? because that's what it boils down to. your memories vs her direct family member.\n\nthat's a clear choice to me, but maybe I'm more empathetic to others than some people are. ultimately, the choice is yours. if you decide to keep the jacket or force her to buy you one in order to give it back, be prepared to live with and lie in whatever consequences may come with that territory.", "If her grandfather had it twice as long as you\u2019ve had it does that mean he gets it back? I don\u2019t know that length of ownership means much here.", "You\u2019re trying to win morality on a technicality.", "You\u2019re not a jerk wanting to keep it - it is your coat now.\n\nIdk, if it were me I\u2019d tell her a rather graphic story about how girls in bars loooove that jacket and how many wanted you to wear it while rawdogging and calling you daddy or something. She\u2019d never want it back after that if you made it good enough \ud83d\ude05", "How long did her Grandpa have it if that's the standard for who the rightful owner is?", "But you do understand that the type of gesture that would satisfy you is a monetary one, right? Whereas hers is an emotional one?", "You can keep the jacket and be remembered by her family/friends as \"that guy who kept something grandpa gave his granddaughter\" or you can just eat the cost, get a new one and give the old one back as a \"I'm sorry your grandpa is dying\"-gesture. Why is it important for you to compromise in this situation?", "Seriously dude step away and think about this situation. You do realise if you continue this route you will not only lose her friendship but all your friends. \n\nIf I was in your friend group, I'd buy you the new jacket so my friend can say goodbye to her grandad wearing the jacket. But I'd drop you as a friend.\n\nWhat's the jacket worth when the people who once cared about you don't want to be seen with you. Hope the jackets worth it.", "It comes from her family member. You don\u2019t get to have a say in whether or not she has sentimental attachment just because she gave it to you 10 years ago back when she was probably much younger and didn\u2019t realize the emotional value it might have. Your friend was gracious enough to give you the jacket for FREE at the time. Think about your behavior here. You are not reciprocating this friendship in the same gracious and understanding manner. Stop being an entitled brat and creating imaginary attachment to a piece of clothing that otherwise means nothing to you and start valuing the actual good humans in your life that care about you enough to offer you things for free when they don\u2019t need them.", "Well thank you. I appreciate and accept your apology.", "OP mentioned in an edit that they haven't even had contact with this friend in a long time until she messaged for the jacket back. Clearly the friendship doesn't mean as much to OP as the jacket does.", "But the friend should have accepted the no. It's not grandpa's jacket anymore and hasn't been.", "Be real shame if OP didn't have the jacket. What then, she can go after someone else? Is that ok too?", "Also yay, there's an update: they're not close friends. Woot! No need to worry. Nobody's morals sullied!", "I agree. You should take some. You're implying that I'm being emotional and getting worked up. It's a jacket, not a cat. If it were a cat I'd need those deep breaths.", "I didn't go off. I'm tired of being told how to speak, what to type, how to type, how to emphasize. My morals say it starts with people controlling how others express themselves and then the morals police go after you. And yes, I'm comparing all of you \"greater social consequence\" warriors to the morals police in Iran. There's some \"greater social consequences\" for you. Have you given a fig about any of the many, Many, MANY women fighting just to show their faces who've gone missing? No, you'd rather question mine, here, for telling someone they're not an asshole for keeping a more than decade old gift.", "She gave it to him, yes. And for a whole decade, did not stay in touch or reconsider. She did not consider OP a friend if she had not reached out to OP in a long time prior to this, so she gave the jacket away to someone she is not particularly close to. Not out of feelings. OP offered a reasonable compromise. If Jackie wants it back, she will act accordingly.  You can't just go through life throwing tantrums to get what you want sweetie, that's not a good look.", "Most my friends are on my side on this. Because they know how much I love the jacket from how often they see me in it. She never cared about it until now.", "If she did have attachment, she wouldn't have given it away. Sometimes you screw up but you have to live with it. \n\nOp on the other hand loves the jacket and it's unfair to ask of them to part with it cause friend regretted it 10 years later.", "Which is fair, if a little tiny bit callous", "I know it's been a decade, but I want my grandpa's cat back now that grandpa is dieing. U understand, right?", "Not sure I'd want friends like that. I'm assuming she was a teenager when she gave you the jacket and now your all in your 20's. Yes she didn't realise what she was giving away. That's no reason to punish her.\n\nI'm also assuming you've never lost a close family member and neither have 'your friends'. Its a horrible pain.", "Also if you are going to give it to her on the condition that she buys you a new one \ud83d\ude44. Offer it now via the mutual friend because she's on a clock. Take the money don't expect her to order it for you shes not in the headrace to deal with all of that.\n\n Her grandad can go any minute and she obviously wants to wear it to say goodbye to him.", "Me me me me. What an amazing person you are! Great friend to have in your life!/s \n\nYTA and a selfish one at that.", "Your friends should be on your side. Because it\u2019s your jacket. She doesn\u2019t deserve something she gave away 9 years ago just because her grandpa is dying now. It\u2019s crazy that some people think you are TA.", "She might have not realized it at the time? Do you know that people mature and come to important realizations later in life? She thought she could rely on her friend to understand her emotions and feelings in a hard time of her grandfather being sick. But I guess being a friend is only good when someone gives you things for free\u2026 when you have good people as your friends you don\u2019t actually \u201chave to live with it\u201d most of the times. \n\nOP\u2019s selfishness is clearly the winner in what\u2019s most important in the situation for people who don\u2019t know how to behave towards your friends lol", "So if a friend you *barely* even spoke to anymore told you they wanted to take back a gift, you'd be cool with giving away something you were *actively using*? Sure, sure.", "But the family and the cat that have been together now for more than a decade, they have built a life together. Cat's aren't jackets. Cats are cats. Dogs are not cats but I'd stand by a dog too. Nope. This is a case of, you gave a jacket away and now you regret it.\n\nOr maybe, just MAYBE, grandpa isn't giving her something more important because he wanted to see how she'd treat the jacket, since we're speculating here, and she didn't appreciate it, so now she realizes she's not maybe gonna get the thing she really wants if she can prove she took care of the jacket now that her inheritance, I mean grandpa, is dying. (See I can do it too!) \n\nBut, good news!!! Grandpa is N O T  U N A L I V E yet! Time to ask grandpa for a memory and/or keepsake. And a hug. Maybe even a video or voice recording. Those would be way more precious to me than some old jacket.", "People mature but the things they do are irreversible. Decent people including myself would have been disappointed at themselves and lived with it rather than ask for it back from a friend who is also attached or atleast offer to replace it for them and the fact that they aren't makes me feel that it's not about attachments but rather about money... \n\nOp is not selfish for being attached to it. people do get attached to pieces of clothing after they have had it for 10 years. Being a friend doesn't mean sacrificing your attachment for theirs.", "Deep breaths \ud83d\ude09"]}
