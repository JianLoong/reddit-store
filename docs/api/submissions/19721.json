The jacket was too big for Jackie and she doesn't wear stuff like that anyway. I was watching SOA at the time and Terminator 2 was one of my favorite movies growing up so I was ecstatic about the offer and immediately said yes. She said she was happy that someone was going to be wearing it instead of just sitting in the closet. On several occasions she said she was happy to see me wearing it.\n\nFor 10 years I wore this jacket. I would get excited to wear it when the weather got cold out. I became known to wear this jacket. I spent all of my 20s in it and into my 30s. I have made countless memories in it. Went through a 9 year relationship with it. Dozens of pictures of me in this jacket etc. I have owned more than twice as long as Jackie has and maybe even longer than her grandfather had at this point. For all intents and purposes it is my jacket now.\n\nJust recently Jackie's grandfather has been having health issues and he may not be with us for much longer. She asked for it back, stating that when she gave it to me she didn't understand the importance of him giving it to her and that it the only she has of his. It's not that I am unsympathetic to this but, I fail to see how having a jacket that she wont wear and will sit in her closet will make her grandfather passing easier. Also her grandfather hasn't passed yet and there's plenty of opportunity for her to ask for something else to remember him by. Maybe even something that she could actually use or keep on display.I told them that I feel bad about the situation but I don't want to give the jacket back because of my own sentimental attachment to the jacket both the memories I have made in it and the fact that she gave it to me.\n\nWhen I told her this her and her friend have told me that I am picking an aesthetic over her connection to her grandfather. I don't feel this way. I may have said yes to her offer of the jacket for aesthetic reasons but I want to keep it because of its sentimental value to me. I feel bad about wanting to keep it but, I also am angry that they seem to dismiss my feelings and memories I have made with this jacket minimizing it to just an aesthetic choice.

In any other situation, I would agree the jacket is yours and she should kick rocks. But it\u2019s not like she\u2019s asking for it back because she suddenly likes leather jackets, my take is that she probably associates it with him more than other items, and it\u2019s a little tone deaf to suggest that she can just have him give her something else. I also think it sounded like she gave you the jacket in good faith as a friend, not expecting that she\u2019d want it back, but now she is coming to you as a friend going through a hard time to request it back and you\u2019re saying no.", "NTA - but you have to understand that she won\u2019t be your friend if you don\u2019t. It\u2019s a matter of if the jacket is more important than your friendship.", "NTA \nIf I heard you correctly, over the past 10 years, the jacket has become an integral part of your life, representing countless memories and experiences. It has become a symbol of your personal journey, with sentimental value that cannot be easily replaced. Returning the jacket would mean severing the emotional connection you have built with it over the years.\n\nMoreover, Jackie originally offered you the jacket because it didn't fit her and she had no use for it. By accepting the jacket, you were led to believe it was yours to keep and enjoy. It is unfair to suddenly demand its return after such a significant period of time.\n\nWhile I understand the sentimental value it holds for Jackie due to her grandfather's connection, it's important to consider the practicality of her request. If the jacket remains in her possession, it may simply end up sitting in a closet, unused and unappreciated. Does it even fit her? \n\nOn the other hand, you have actively worn and cherished the jacket, allowing it to continue its purpose and be a part of your life.\n\nUltimately, the decision should take into account the history and attachment you have developed with the jacket. Good luck!", "YTA\n\nher grandad is dying and she's grieving his loss. The jacket wasn't a big thing because she had him in her life.\n\nShe didn't have to give you the jacket but she was kind to you and did. In her hour of need your being selfish. You don't know what that jacket meant to her grandad and she obviously didn't at the time either.\n\nDon't be a jackass go buy a new jacket and make memories and let her have a piece of her grandad back. She might give it back to you one day but I hope you realise you've tarnished this friendship.", "ESH. It's just a thing. Memories are in your head. And you shouldn't ask for gifts back. But if you want to save your friendship, you know what to do", "YTA. That's super screwed up to do something that's painful to her because of your fond memories of her generosity towards you.", "YTA\n\nTo you it\u2019s a jacket. Maybe you\u2019ve had it a long time and have grown attached to it, but it\u2019s a jacket. \nTo your friend Jackie, this is one of the few things she will have to remember a dead family member. Have some empathy", "NTA she gave a gift that she didn't think through that's her problem you don't gift something then demand it back 10 years later", "NTA", "NTA it's your jacket, but you will lose your friend if you keep it. You need to decide whether it's worth it. Like someone else mentioned, the other side is that you might resent your friend if you give it back, so the friendship might be done either way.", "Nta. It was a gift. She was an adult when she gave it away and should face the consequences of her actions. My guess is a family member  berated her when they found out she gave it away. STBH = Sucks To Be Her.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like Jackie had it in a cupboard for maybe 5 years. Her Grandpa had it sitting around for anything up to 10 years. (tell us the brand OP and we can do some digging)\n\nSo I'm not sure how she can be sentimentally attached to a jacket that clearly gramps didn't want or wear, that she then didn't wear.\n\nI'm sure there are much more personal items she'll be able to choose from to remember him with when he eventually dies. \n\nSeems like a weird hill for her to want to die on.", "Nta it was a gift.

Up to you though.", "NTA - That jacket was a gift, and over a decade ago - either way, you're losing a friend here.\n\nOption for you to consider - buy a second hand 1 from a thrift shop or online, that looks similar, hand her that she's not likely to be any the wiser to any small blemishes that the jacket has, she hasn't worn them into the jacket herself.\n\nPeople who are saying just hand it back maybe don't realise the investment of time and sentimental emotion that goes into a well worn in leather jacket, you'll not feel the same in a different 1 and she won't have the connection with it she thinks she does.", "I can't imagine being more attached to an article of clothing more than my best friend and their family I received it from. I've been best friends with my bestie since we were freshman in high school, almost fifteen years ago. If they gave me something they didn't realize would have an emotional impact on them, I would return it no questions asked. It's a piece of clothing to you. It's a piece of her grandfather for her. I really think YTA. Go buy a damn vintage jacket that looks just like it.", "10 years? Yeah, it's yours now NTA maybe she shouldn't have given it away.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
