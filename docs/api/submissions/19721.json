{"id": 19721, "submission_id": "149tgt2", "title": "AITA For not giving back a leather jacket that was given to me over 10 years ago?", "selftext": "So, 10 years ago a friend of mine (lets call her Jackie) offered me a leather biker jacket that her grandfather had given her. The jacket was too big for Jackie and she doesn't wear stuff like that anyway. I was watching SOA at the time and Terminator 2 was one of my favorite movies growing up so I was ecstatic about the offer and immediately said yes. She said she was happy that someone was going to be wearing it instead of just sitting in the closet. On several occasions she said she was happy to see me wearing it.\n\nFor 10 years I wore this jacket. I would get excited to wear it when the weather got cold out. I became known to wear this jacket. I spent all of my 20s in it and into my 30s. I have made countless memories in it. Went through a 9 year relationship with it. Dozens of pictures of me in this jacket etc. I have owned more than twice as long as Jackie has and maybe even longer than her grandfather had at this point. For all intents and purposes it is my jacket now.\n\nJust recently Jackie's grandfather has been having health issues and he may not be with us for much longer. She asked for it back, stating that when she gave it to me she didn't understand the importance of him giving it to her and that it the only she has of his. It's not that I am unsympathetic to this but, I fail to see how having a jacket that she wont wear and will sit in her closet will make her grandfather passing easier. Also her grandfather hasn't passed yet and there's plenty of opportunity for her to ask for something else to remember him by. Maybe even something that she could actually use or keep on display.I told them that I feel bad about the situation but I don't want to give the jacket back because of my own sentimental attachment to the jacket both the memories I have made in it and the fact that she gave it to me.\n\nWhen I told her this her and her friend have told me that I am picking an aesthetic over her connection to her grandfather. I don't feel this way. I may have said yes to her offer of the jacket for aesthetic reasons but I want to keep it because of its sentimental value to me. I feel bad about wanting to keep it but, I also am angry that they seem to dismiss my feelings and memories I have made with this jacket minimizing it to just an aesthetic choice. So AITA I kind of feel that way but I also equally feel justified in keeping it.\n\nUPDATE: Me and this friend are not that close. She dated my brother and then later one of my friends. We became friends because of our mutual friends. But some of those friendships have become estranged and we have drifted apart. This message from her asking for the jacket back was the first contact from her in quite some time.

In any other situation, I would agree the jacket is yours and she should kick rocks.

It has become a symbol of your personal journey, with sentimental value that cannot be easily replaced. Returning the jacket would mean severing the emotional connection you have built with it over the years.\n\nMoreover, Jackie originally offered you the jacket because it didn't fit her and she had no use for it. By accepting the jacket, you were led to believe it was yours to keep and enjoy. It is unfair to suddenly demand its return after such a significant period of time.\n\nWhile I understand the sentimental value it holds for Jackie due to her grandfather's connection, it's important to consider the practicality of her request. If the jacket remains in her possession, it may simply end up sitting in a closet, unused and unappreciated. Does it even fit her? \n\nOn the other hand, you have actively worn and cherished the jacket, allowing it to continue its purpose and be a part of your life.\n\nUltimately, the decision should take into account the history and attachment you have developed with the jacket.

The fact that they accused you of valuing aesthetics over emotional attachment when you actually gave an emotionally attached reason also gives me pause. If there really was a significant meaning to the jacket this would have been the perfect time for her to tell you in detail. The fact she didn\u2019t leads me to believe that other commenters are correct in their assumption that she recently found out it\u2019s worth some serious cash. Or Grandpa asked about if.

It was a gift. What if she hadn\u2019t given it to OP? What if she had donated it or sold it online or something?? Then how would she get it back? Obviously I don\u2019t think she\u2019s wrong for wanting to hold on to it now that her grandpa is at risk of dying, but maybe she should hold on to something else of her grandpa?

It has been in your possession for a long time. \n\nI am wondering if her grandfather asked about it, and she is now panicking, trying to get it back for his sake because she doesn't want to admit she no longer has it.

She gave it away, thus it wasn't important. She can't wait a literal decade before feeling giver's remorse, especially if you've spent a good chunk of that decade actually in the jacket making memories. \n\nYou're not choosing an aesthetic over her grandpa.

It\u2019s a complete cheek for her to ask for it back.\n\nAs you said, her grandfather can easily pass on something else to her, something that\u2019s better suited to her.", "NAH you both are attached to this jacket for different reasons. She has come to recognize the significance of the jacket as her Grandfather's health deteriorates. It could also be her being older now and realizing things she didn't before. \n\n\nOn the other hand you have made your own memories with this jacket. It has become significant to you.\n\n\nThere is no easy solution. One means keeping the jacket but possibly losing the friendship that brought you the jacket. The other means returning it  but causing you to resent your friend for taking back the gift that was given to you.

What's to stop her asking for something else, like something he's worn sometime in the last 10 years?\n\nAnd OP has sentimental attachment. That can't be replaced with a new jacket any more than grandpa's one can be.\n\nThink about it - the friend's sentimentality is based on a single moment, that of her grandad giving it to her.

You cannot compare sentiment,  and OP is already being kind by saying if Jackie buys OP a duplicate Jackie can have the original back. Then both people can move forward happy.

She's only asking for it back because she will soon not have her grandfather, and so sentiment becomes a lot more important. I get that you love the jacket but you love it as a fashion item!

Leave it up to the universe. She might not notice the small detail is different, and if she does take the OG one and her grandfather notices the difference say you had to get them replaced due to damage. Feel free at that point to offer her the replacement with the correct buttons in exchange for the OG back. \n\n\nMake her the asshole. Tell other friends that you will consider forgiving her later if you can get past the fact she thinks a gifted jacket with 10 years of memories is more important than your friendship.

But that doesn't mean you don't get to be hurt by her choosing a jacket over your friendship and need a break to reevaluate things, and no one who is actually your friend can argue with that. \n\n\nAlso taking it back because it belongs to her grandfather isn't a good reason. When he dies I am sure she can get other keepsakes, or she can ask for other keepsakes now. When my grandparents died we were swimming in stuff to keep or donate. She might have actually asked for something and he might have asked what happened to the coat since he doesn't want stuff that holds memories for him that were expensive to be just given away or discarded because she decided she didn't want it a month later. A lot of people just don't want to think their stuff will all be donated or trashed or sold and nothing sentimental kept, so he could be thinking of this jacket as a test.

Asking out of the blue for the jacket may well have been quite hard for her, and your defensive response is making it harder. It doesn't matter if it'll stay in a closet. Carefully kept items of my deceased parents are in the closet - and I get to feel that connection to them when I want to.\n\nFrom OP's original post I was veering to e s h, but from your additional comments it's YTA.

It also helps that shes not a close friend, because it will affect the relationship from now on, but she can only really blame herself for not caring about it in the first place.

If she want its back, she better damn give OP another jacket like it or she can kick rocks and deal with her consequences. You never ask for a gift back especially if the receiver already made use of the gift, no less than a decade.", "but that\u2019s exactly OPs point, he also has 10 years of memories with jacket, and it has sentimental value to him as well. I admit it\u2019s a fucked up situation, but they are not even close, and this was the first time they reconnect in a while, only for her to ask for her jacket. For me it\u2019s not ok in any case to ask for something back 10 years later, which you obviously didn\u2019t want, I know I couldn\u2019t do it.", "You can't re-gift items you already gave away. You no longer own that item. Nowhere in the world is that normal.", "Most people I know my friends and family are my side. Its been 10 years 1/3 of my life. She didn't care about it before. I do care about it I appreciate it. I have lost many people in my life and never have I thought getting some material possession back would make it easier. especially not one that I willingly gave away.", "Because her memories of her grandpa aren't attached to the jacket. She can still have memories of him without the jacket. She can find something else of his to keep to remember him by. My memories on the other hand are tied to the jacket. Its not about making a deal it was about trying to find a compromise.", "No not content I would still be sad to see it go. Especially since it would probably end up back in the closet collecting dust. I just think this is a compromise.", "Damn, beat me to it", "Yeah, I died a little when I read \u201coutlet hole\u201d", "Agreed. And it's not low class behaviour. But NTA.", "Nothing like a good death in the family to bring out the vultures. Look up one that happened in Sydney Australia. Woman laid dead for YEARS before being found in her now valuable property in Eastern suburb of Sydney. Funnily enough the family were fighting over the property but didn\u2019t notice the old lady missing for nearly a decade I think it was.", "I work hospice  now but used to be a social worker in a hospital. Man come in with his daughter, she's caregiver. . His son lives half way across the country is poa. Man is sick sick and at this point likely to never leave the hospital and daughter wants hospice so she can have help since she knows his disease is just gonna progress.  \nPoa son refuses. Comes down from wherever. Won't  sign hospice, dni, dnr. Any of it. Literally tells the doctor to \"do compressions till his brain is mush\". Hospital tried to get the ethics committee involved but there was nothing they could do. Man died in the ICU.", "LITERALLY. When she gave it away in her young 20s she likely just didn\u2019t value sentimental items at the time\u2026 like most young 20s\u2026", "And her grandfather's house has already been emptied by all the other relatives?", "I have 4 leather jackets. I bought one new in 2006 for \u00a3100 but the other 3 are charity shop buys and I didn't spend more than a tenner on any of them", "Tons of \"Top Gun\" cool leather jackets from the time that movie came out in 1986.", "I'm still mad about the early 90s leather jacket I lost while travelling two decades ago. For some reason they can be very emotionally laden, I think because they last so long.", "Yep. I would be pretty flabbergasted if I had a friend who did this. I would honestly even give my enemy back their jacket in this scenario. It is just petty to not do so.", "Lol what? How would OP be \u201churt\u201d by someone politely asking back for a jacket.", "I disagree. The friend's emotional attachment to the jacket trumps OP's \"well, I've worn it for 10 years and I really like it now\". Not sure why OP would be hurt, under the circumstances.", "Yeah there are obviously a lot of people here that haven\u2019t lost someone close to them. I understand what you did completely.", "Ironic how you\u2019re calling it a material possession to downplay its significance yet when it comes to justifying your (wrong, imo) opinion/decision then of course it\u2019s so sentimental and a big part of your life!", "Not friends and family, (lol, \u201cwell my mommy think\u2019s I\u2019m in the right\u201d)they\u2019d be biased.  I\u2019m talking about just people you\u2019d see on the street.  It\u2019s easy to say that if you didn\u2019t make a dumb regrettable decision as a teen (I\u2019ve noticed you\u2019ve gone quite a ways to avoid telling us the friend\u2019s age when they gave it to you) but she has.  Like, just admit you care about it\u2019s aesthetic more than you care about her feelings, the honesty would make a bit more respectable.", "My dude, if the memories you have of that relationship are intrinsically tied to a piece of clothing, you\u2019ve got bigger problems than this jacket. \nYou too can find something else to remember that relationship (or anything else for that matter) by. Same arguments you use for Jackie apply to you. Except that her Grandad bought it, wore it, made memories in it, it meant something to him and that is why he gave it to his young grandkid that didn\u2019t know how to appreciate it at the time. That\u2019s why she wants it now. \nYou trying to turn the tables to keep it or at the very least get another one for free speaks volumes of the type of person you are. \nYou\u2019re a grown up. Buy yourself your very own jacket and start making new memories with it instead of taking advantage of a kid\u2019s mistake.", "I am face palming so hard. You are being so cruel and for what? I would give back an enemy their jacket in this scenario. YTA.", "Just say yes then. Jesus.", "that's not a compromise, that's an asshole move.", "Jesus, YTA coming up with every excuse not to give this jacket back. \u2018He had lots of leather jackets and this is apparently just the one that this granddaughter got\u2019? And you \u2018fail to see how having the jacket just sitting in her closet is going to help her process her grief\u2019? Seriously, you are being unbelievably selfish. It sounds like has matured over the past 10 years and you have not. If this was just some jacket she bought and didn\u2019t like at the time she gave it to you I\u2019d say NTA, but ffs have some empathy.", "\"Hey, you know that jacket I gave you 10 years ago that you really love and have worn ever winter since I gave it to you and you have countless pictures in it besides tons of memories tied up in it - well I want it back.\"\n\nI guess I just don't know what low class is ; )", "That's so bloody sad I loath Vultures, and think of them more as a twisted form of grave robbers except things of monetary value.\ud83d\ude20", "That\u2019s bananas", "Based off the vague age descriptions and OP\u2019s efforts to skirt around saying how old the friend was, I think the friend might have actually been a teenager when this happened.", "For the same reason the friend is hurt by OP politely declining.", "It really doesn\u2019t matter. OP was given the jacket as a gift. You don\u2019t ask for a gift back. Doesn\u2019t matter what reason the friend has. And this emotionally attachment only began after a decade. She is being ridiculous.", "It's not I've worn it for 10 years. It's I've owned it for 10 years. Once you give a gift it's not yours anymore. If you're gifted something it's not temporary ownership that can be revoked. OP is hurt because for 10 years it has been something they have cherished.   \n\n\nThe entitlement of the friend is off the charts.", "The friend does not have an emotional attachment to the jacket. Imagine if the friend told her grandpa that she had given away the jacket 10 years ago. Do you think that'd go over well?\n\nAsking for gifts back after such time is such a rude thing to do, regardless of circumstances. They're gifts, not loans.", "\u201cChoose your battles wisely!\u201d\nNarrator: They did not choose their battles wisely.", "Wait\u2026 I get what you\u2019re saying but turning the tables goes both ways. \n\nIn other words, by your logic it would be fair for OP to say, \u201cJackie, if the memories you have of your relationship to your grandpa are intrinsically tied to a piece of clothing, you\u2019ve got bigger problems than this jacket.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think either is true, btw,   I actually am very sentimental abt objects, but I\u2019m saying you can\u2019t criticize OP for doing what Jackie is doing. I don\u2019t know what the answer is here but I don\u2019t think either of them are A H for WANTING the jacket.", "She is 2 years younger than me so its not like taking advantage of someone younger and naive. I get we can all find something else to make attachments to but she gave it to me. If it was only a year ago I would hesitate to give it back but its been a decade.", "What would be a compromise to you then? I willing to take suggestions.", "You clearly don\u2019t? It\u2019s not tacky or low-class to ask a question. She asked for a jacket back. Her dying grandfather\u2019s jacket. \n\nOP obviously has some sort of strong connection to it so they don\u2019t have to give it back if they don\u2019t want to but no one is behaving outrageously here. It\u2019s just one of those situations that\u2019s a little bit sticky for everyone.", "It is her dying grandpas old jacket.", "> Once you give a gift it's not yours anymore.\n\nYup, I am always amazed at how some people can take gifts back. You have to be a special kind of AH\n\nEdit: OP NTA", "They were close at the time, it sounds like they were both kids when this happened. Teenagers don't make the most sensible decisions. His said himself that they had met over the past 10 years because shes complimented him over the years.\n\nWe only have his side of the story but even taking in his viewpoint. He still comes across as an Ass.", "Here\u2019s why I think there\u2019s a different: it\u2019s an expensive item that JACKIE\u2019s Grandad bought and wore and he later gave to JACKIE. It has her grandad\u2019s memories, that\u2019s why it is important for her. The memories of a family member are, in my book, way more important that those of an ex partner. \nIf OP doesn\u2019t give the jacket back, here\u2019s what Jackie\u2019s memories will be: \u201cmy Grandpa gave me something that had emotional and monetary value for him and because I was a kid and never thought the day when he\u2019d no longer be here would come, I care freely gave it away to someone who\u2019s only attached to it as a fashion item whose personality was so questionable he seem to have built it exclusively around of a piece of clothing\u201d. \nSee why, to me, Jackie\u2019s memories are more important? See why it belongs to her? It has HER GRADAD\u2019S MEMORIES in it. Way more important that the memories of an ex. \nPlus, I\u2019m quite positive OP has photos of him wearing it. In Grandad\u2019s days, photos weren\u2019t as easy to take and save as nowadays.", "It is different because it was her sickly grandpa\u2019s jacket.", "How old was she when she gave it to you?  You say you spent your 20\u2019s in the jacket and now into your 30\u2019s\n\nSo was she in her teens when she gave it to you?\n\nThen YTA. You took a jacket from someone who didn\u2019t understand the deep attachment she would have with the object. She probably never thought about her grandfather passing before. \n\nNow she understands.  You can keep the jacket but you would be an AH to probably several people.", "I wouldn't feel the need to compromise anything with a grieving friend over a jacket, lol. \nHer grandfather gave it to her, and you only want a jacket to look good in. Get it yourself.", "Maybe see it this way: you have the oppurtunity to help a grieiving friend, and you benefited from her gift for 10 years. Giver her her grandfathers jacket, buy a new one and start making new memories in a jacket that is not tainted by this fight between you two.", "It's not been her grandpa's anything for 10 years.", "My thoughts exactly. They were both kids and she was even younger than him. Two years when you\u2019re a teen make a big difference, OP. \nAnd given the fact that that was Jackie\u2019s Grandpa\u2019s jacket, it\u2019s up to you to find something new to create new memories. Stop making excuses for yourself. \nGive that jacket back. Be grateful that you got to enjoy for free for ten years. Express that gratitude to Jackie, tell her you\u2019re sorry that her Grandad isn\u2019t doing well, take your adult money and get your very own jacket.", "OP is in their 30s now!"]}
