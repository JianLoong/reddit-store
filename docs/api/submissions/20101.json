This means the employer can get a much cheaper deal because they are leasing lots of cars (for their employees) versus OP leasing a car as an individual. This makes it cheaper for the employee.\n\n2) You pay for the lease directly from your salary *before* any tax/deductions are made, which effectively 'lowers' your salary (there's the sacrifice), so you pay less tax overall. This is especially beneficial if you are a higher rate tax payer. Say your salary is \u00a330k per year and your lease is  \u00a33k per year, you 'sacrifice' the \u00a33k from your salary so that you effectively get paid \u00a327k plus have a car. So you only pay tax etc on \u00a327k instead of \u00a330k, effectively saving you money.\n\n3) There are even better deals on electric cars because it is a government-endorsed scheme and they have emissions targets to meet and this helps incentivise people to switch to EV.\n\nTldr; It is completely legit and works exactly the same as any other lease hire agreement, but it is much more cost efficient. If OP was looking at lease hire for a new car anyway, this is the best way to do it.", "If they can't explain the program correctly, then yup, OP's SO has reason to be concerned. \n\nGet on that first because you can't have a discussion without correct information.", "I think most of us in the U.S. are used to the word \"scheme\" having a slightly different meaning to us.  Here, it implies impropriety and criminality.  I kind of figured it out as I read, but my initial reaction to the wording was that this thing sounded very sketchy.", "You are correct. I\u2019m sorry that I haven\u2019t been very clear in the op, I had what the scheme was about originally but couldn\u2019t publish as it was over the word limit. I did speak to my partner about the benefits and basic lease agreement however the conversation got derailed by talking about the electricity bill etc and devolved from there. I\u2019ve sent my partner the full details of what it entails for him to read over.", "I believe it's legit. But I'm specifically looking for OP to be able to explain it because OP is the one entering this financial agreement and should be able to lay out the terms to her SO and here. You explaining what it might be isn't any reason for her SO to be reassured.", "It sounds like they can and it\u2019s a well known UK government program.", "You don't detail how you two handle finances other than the fact your fiance pays the electricity bill but he may have legitimate concerns. Unless you're on a specific EV tariff, I don't think you can isolate the EV costs from the rest of the electricity bill (i might be wrong about that), so he might be worried about footing the bill for your car 'fuel'. Can you not just have a communal pool that you both contribute to proportionate to your income, and all the bills are paid from that, rather than 'his' bills and 'your' bills. It also helps with credit scores etc to have both your names on the utility bills.\n\nThe free home charging point installation is a great bonus, but whose property is it? If its his, did you ask if you could install it? If you're planning on moving soon, did you factor in that you'll have to pay for another one at the new place?\n\nIf he wants an EV too, have you thought about how that will work? How will you charge them both? How will you split the electricity bill? \n\nHe needs to clearly articulate the reason for his objection, and you need to properly listen. I must admit, I would have had all these discussions *before* actually doing anything, but better to have them now than not at all.", "Exactly. \n\nOP: I cannot explain this financial thing entirely but we should do it!\n\nSO: What? How? Why? Don't yet. \n\nHard to have a discussion when you don't know what to discuss. That is the fiance's POV.", "Judging by the sheer number of people who blindly walk into a car lease agreement, OP isn't the first and won't be the last who doesn't completely understand!\n\nYou may be right, and that is the fianc\u00e9's problem. If OP was going to get a new car via leasehold anyway though, this is the best way to do it. Maybe they hadn't spoken specifically about how OP was going to get the new car they need, and the two of them are not on the same page about finances", "If their electric bill increases immediately after OP starts charging an EV at home, the difference will be the amount due to charging the car.\n\nAlternatively, I don't know how electric bills in the UK look, but mine (Midwestern US) tell me how much energy I've used and how much I'm being charged for it. OP and her fianc\u00e9 could compare previous bills to new ones (it would likely be most accurate to compare, say, August 2023 against August 2022) and see how much more energy they are using.\n\nEither way, isolating the cost of charging the EV should not be remotely difficult.", "> You may be right, and that is the fianc\u00e9's problem.\n\nOP's post is literally about not understanding the fianc\u00e9's problem. Look at the title again.", "OK, firstly; I was agreeing with you, so no need to get shirty.\n\nSecondly; you made a good point about what *potentially* the fiance could be upset about, but unless you're actually the fiance you don't actually know. So no need to get shirty.\n\nFinally; the OP doesn't seem to get using the term 'I don't understand my fianc\u00e9's problem' in the same literal way that you have interpreted it. So no need to get shirty.", "Oooh he's jealous. NTA", "NTA. I don't understand what he's not understanding.\n\nMake sure you have all the info, including whether you would be buying or leasing the car, the insurance info, interest rate, maintenance on an electric car, what happens if you leave your job, etc. Get documentation about the benefit, not second-hand conjecture. It may also help for you to try and figure out an estimate of the increase in electricity so you have a more complete view of the monthly cost of the car.\n\nIf you do go forward with getting an electric car, I suggest - if your fiance is not getting an electric car any time soon and he is concerned about himself paying the electric bill - that you swap one or more bills so that you are paying the electric bill. That seems easier to me than trying to repay your fiance every month for the \"excess\" electricity.", "NTA and what do your parents have to do with it?", "I\u2019m concerned that there\u2019s a very controlling dimension to his behavior, OP. He seems really concerned that you\u2019re going to get personal access to a wholly owned-by-you vehicle with no more input or dependence on him.", "ESH, well considering that historically he's been carrying at least most of the financial load I wouldn't be surprised if he thinks you aren't seeing the potential ramifications and only using rose colored glasses in this situation. Unless you have a very in demand job that this is a perk of I would also be very skeptical that your company is basically going to pony up all this money for you to buy an unnecessarily expensive brand new electric car rather than a more practical used car.", "NTA, figure out the electric bill concern and get the car. Personally if both myself and fianc\u00e9 (or wife) were considering getting EVs, would go second on that. Would want to see first hand how well that works out. Who knows, might ended up being jealous and and then get one too.", "Ok fair do, but the way the initial issue is framed is a little eyebrow raising.", "It's a thing. My friend got a tesla through his work through a salary sacrifice scheme, and it ends up being cheaper than buying it retail and it's taken out pre-tax, so his taxable income is lower. He gets free charging at work too, so his travel expenses are way down.", "Sometimes people are just mean/selfish/jealous/condescending/whatever", "Wait so after you told him you are planing to get a car he accused you of not talking to him before you got a car? \ud83e\uddd0", "They explained it fine. I understood perfectly well.", "True.  I once had a group of lawyers tell me to stop referring to my plan as a sceme, lol.  Makes it sound criminal.", "Yeah... that wouldn't be *that* easy in the UK, although not impossible if looking at the actual kilowatt hours used rather than the monetary cost of the bill.\n\nFor many reasons, the bills are so variable; seasonal changes, all the wholesale costs have increased massively over the past year, we had a series of cost of living payments/reductions on energy bills last winter-spring which have now stopped. It won't be a simple case of, the electricity bill was \u00a330 last July and its \u00a3100 this July so the \u00a370 difference must be OP's car. \n\nIf car costs are not included in the household budget then it will be very imprecise. It will be even more difficult to separate them out once the fiance gets an EV I imagine. Although I don't know, maybe it's possible - I don't have direct experience of home charging an EV.", "NTA, but be very careful with Novated Leases!  Heard some horror stories.\n\nBest thing to find out is what happens if you leave that job or are fired before the term of the lease/payment plan is up.", "When I\u2019m stressed or anxious, especially about money problems, it\u2019s almost like I\u2019ve reached my tolerance to process anything immediate. When my husband would approach me in this state, I would get easily frustrated and sometimes took it out on him. Maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s going on here. \n\nOR he\u2019s so used to taking care of you so long that he doesn\u2019t see you as an adult woman who can make her own decisions and needs someone else to agree with him so he can talk down to you and talk you out of it. \n\nI *hope* it\u2019s more of the first one because that can be improved upon with lots of self work and self awareness. The second, probably not as much. NTA but you need to have a good long talk with your fianc\u00e9 when he stops having this hissy fit.", "Is he sexist in other ways? Does he like making the decisions eg about where you live? This would give me pause, I have to say. Won't say it's a red flag, but it's looking pinkish.\n\nYou are obviously NTA - the scheme is a great option and you are right to take it.", "and sometimes it's both", "I think there\u2019s some cultural differences here that gave the commenters pause. Scheme in the USA is basically an assumed negative connotation.", "Could you just switch up some of the bill paying so you pay electric and he covers something you're currently paying?"]}
