Then you were family.  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your brother thinks he's entitled to your house, income and life in general.\n\nHelping doesn't mean turning over the reigns of your life to your brother for his benefit.  He needs to own up to his responsibilities and, he can declare bankruptcy if he needs to. \n\nBTW, you will not go to hell for refusing to aid your fiscally irresponsible brother. In fact, the bible has some very specific teachings on being responsible with money. Your brother's failings are not your failings. You do not have to partake in his downfall.\n\nIf you want to give them some funds to keep them off the streets, then it's between you and your wife how much to give and where the cut off line is, but they are not entitled to anything.", "NTA \n\nYour brother has some nerve!!!\n\nIf he knows where you live, please get surveillance cameras around your house, if you don't have them already. Protect yourself and your wife. Block his number and the church member(s) from contacting you, whether in person or on the phone. \n\nYou don't owe your brother a dime. He is irresponsible for the choices he made and that's not your responsibility.", "NTA. Honestly, most of this is irrelevant. You don't have to help him, you don't want to help him, and it's not really feasible for you to help him. It doesn't sound like you two have much of a relationship so just tell him no, stick with your answer, and refuse to discuss it with anyone else.", "NTA\n\nThe church can help your brother.", "NTA\n\nThe cult is trying to get your money and house. This is how cults work. They drain their members of any and all resources they have (which is why your brother has no money of his own). Then they get their members to try to get whatever they can out of family, friends, work associates, anyone. If you give your brother money, that will go directly to the cult. If you let them move in with you they'll try to convert you to the cult, try to find ways to get money out of you, etc. Do not give them anything.\n\nI would say, if you want to help your brother that's admirable. Probably even the right thing to do. But you don't have to do that by giving him money or a place to stay. Make it clear he's never getting those things out of you under any circumstances, but if he wants to talk you're there for him. Cults work by isolating members from the rest of society. The way to get someone out of a cult is by breaking that isolation and showing them they can exist apart from the cult. That starts by having a relationship. You're under no obligation to do so, but if you want to help your brother, the best thing you can do is just talk with him and let him know that there is a life outside of the cult.", "NTA. The irony of smack talking women in the workplace, and then expecting that money be used to house his kids.", "Lmaoooo I'm gonna start saying that. \"I wish I was as good a brother as Cain\" effing mic drop", "NTA. Your brother is an adult and responsible for his choices.", "NTA \n\nNot your circus, not your monkeys. \n\nLet his cult take care of him and his spawn.", "You are obviously NTA, and you already know that. Your brother chose his life and made his own bed. You are not obligated to give him any money or housing if you don't want to. Just because they are family does not give them the right to demand or guilt trip money or housing from you.", "If you are no family to him now, then at least he won't call again needing money, or to move in, or for you to rescue him from his choices?\n\nOne can hope.\n\nNTA. Who can dig him out of the hole he finds himself in without going bankrupt themselves? In many ways I am my brother's keeper. But, I don't think that can actually rescue your brother without ruining your own life?", "YNTA on this one in my opinion.\n\n>A church member reached out on his family behalf and threatened me with hell for abandoning my brother \n\nI don't quite see why the church ir church member is threatening you instead of helping out one of their own ~~cult~~ community members.\n\nWhat a cult. Won't even help one of their own...", "NTA\n\nIf you let them move in, you will be living in hell.  No need to get there any sooner than necessary.", "NTA! Also the Cain comment was great.", "NTA.  Sounds like these people are looney as hell.   It's not your problem that they put themselves in a situation where they had to commit tax fraud in order to get by.   Probably best to go LC for a while.", "While your brother is still under the influence of the cult, you cant really do anything as you'd only be helping the cult.  As they have now milked your brother dry, you have been targeted, your brother is just the thin end of the wedge.  Protect your wife, and yourself.  NTA.", "NTA. Do not, I repeat, do not even offer a scintilla of help to him because if you do, Katy bar the door!! You'll have 22 empty hands reaching out for what you got. His life, his choices, his consequences.", "NTA. Your brother is responsible for his choices, not you.", "NTA.  Brother made his choices - you most certainly should NOT be the one to pay for them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You have every right to prioritize your wife's needs and the use of her office for work. It's not your responsibility to bail out your brother and his family, especially considering their involvement in a cult. Stay strong and stand your ground.", "NTA \ud83e\udd23nice comeback with the Cain comment. That said no you are not responsible for your nieces and nephews it is sad what they are going through however that is not your fault your brother and his cult should have remembered Jesus telling the priest render to ceaser what belongs to ceaser and render to God what belongs to God. Not precise but you get the gist.  Paying taxes suck but losing you home and land is worse.", "I understand that you don't want to help someone who has clouded views on life, and your brother had no need for you until his world came crashing down. I find it amazing that people that don't know you have a say in how you should help someone they consider one of them. I can't say that you're and AH, because I don't know you or your brother that well. It looks like the two of you are not close (probably because of his beliefs) so, apparently you aren't the only family member that feels he is not looking for help, but handouts. If he has not safeguarded this from happening to his family before, how is going to keep it from happening again?  Hope you won't have to continue to be harassed by the cult.", "NTA, as you said, it's your wife's money to use as she chooses. Your brother chose this lifestyle, he should figure out a way to dig himself out of the hole.", "NTA. \n\nHe judges the hell out of you (haha) until he needs help, and then he's suggesting modifications to your house and upend your life and your wife's work, to accommodate him. \n\nWhen you express the inability to do so, then it's right BACK to \"you're no family to me\".  \n\nThat tells me that you never were, until he needed help. \n\n\nBesides - the only reason you'd want cult members in your house is the ability to instill in the kids that there's a normal world out there, for better or for worse, but that will certainly come at a very high cost to you. \n\n\nYou might want to remind him of Galatians 6:7: \n\n*Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he will also reap.*\n\nOr Job 4:8:\n\n*According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity\nand those who sow trouble harvest it.*\n\nOr Proverbs 11:18.\n\n\nIn short - you'll preserve your own peace of mind, and that of your wife, by not allowing them anywhere NEAR your house!\n\nI feel bad for the kids though.", "Here is the thing. Something might not be your responsibility or your trouble but sometimes doing the right thing is not about you but about them.\n\nI would not do ANYTHING that will benefit their cult. But there are 9 children now involved and at some point this issue is going to knock you squarely in the stomach. You've already lost your Mom and Dad to the cult... can you save any of your nieces or nephews? Maybe take a couple in and get them in school? Sports?\n\nMaybe make financial assistance based upon both he and his wife getting paid jobs? \n\nJust some thoughts...", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m afraid your brother sounds really entitled, I would cut all contact", "Consider haloing him with money to pay the back taxes to save his house. It will be an ongoing catastrophe otherwise.", "So the sanctimonious cult cheated with their taxes? \n\nWhere does the Bible stand on that? \n\nNTA - your brother no doubt considers you a sinner who'll go to hell, and yet he wants your dirty sinful money? Aren't hypocritical Christians just the best?", "NTA the amount of people who suddenly become family when money enters the equation is astonishing.  You aren\u2019t responsible for your brother\u2019s mistakes. \n\nAlso, *I wish I could be as good a brother as Cain* is just about the best comeback in this situation. Thanks for the laugh!", "NTA.  I guess those church members can help him out huh?", "Everyone wants to be a trad husband and wife until it comes time to put on your big boy pants and \"lead\" the family as a provider/protector/guiding light. \n\nI'd tell him to get a job you loser, God helps those who help themselves.  \n\nNTA", "NTA at all. No way do you want cultists moving into your home.  \n\nIf you wanted to do something, only to prove he's not reliable,  offer him a loan of $1000.  If he was honourable and was grateful, he would accept, and pay back the loan.  If not, then for a low price of $1000 you never have to worry about justifying your saying 'no' ever again.", "NTA. You are not responsible for your brother and his bad decisions. \"I told them I wish I could be as a good brother as Cain but I fear for the consequences.\" OMG you are awesome for saying this to the church member!!! I just laughed so hard I scared my cat.", "Lol if you brothers fellow cult member is powerful enough to send you to hell, surely they can come up with an out for his tax situation.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your brother is not devout enough. Where is his faith? Why doesn't he just pray so god can provide for him?", "*My brother got mad and said I was no family to him*\n\nMeh, so since you aren't family, no need to offer any type of charity. \n\n*A church member reached out on his family behalf and threatened me with hell for abandoning my brother*\n\nYawn. If that church member is so invested, let them help.\n\nNTA", "Some of my extended family started a cult so let me give you some advice. Stay strong and never ever ever EVER give them money and never let them into your home. Keep yourself and your wife safe and away from him.", "True and I did remind him that\u2019s my wife\u2019s money. She got from going to college and working long hours.", "This is an important point.\n\nBailing out somebody who is still living the same way is just pouring money into somebody else's pot.  Most likely the \"church\" will regroup and set up again someplace else, and your money will just be used as a down-payment.\n\nI was somewhat sympathetic until the church member called to threaten him with damnation.  Nope - walk away.", "You think I can just sign minor that I have no relationship with who are home schooled into sports or an education system. If if they lived with me it\u2019s not my job to save them. I can call CPS and the police for wellness checks. But if you are so inclined I can give my brother your information and you can take them in and save them.", "What a silly response", "It's always the way it goes", "You could forward him the info to apply for section 8 and welfare.  And please remind him he should be the one to provide as he is the head of the house."]}
