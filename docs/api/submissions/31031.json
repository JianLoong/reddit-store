Your brother thinks he's entitled to your house, income and life in general.\n\nHelping doesn't mean turning over the reigns of your life to your brother for his benefit.  He needs to own up to his responsibilities and, he can declare bankruptcy if he needs to. \n\nBTW, you will not go to hell for refusing to aid your fiscally irresponsible brother. In fact, the bible has some very specific teachings on being responsible with money. Your brother's failings are not your failings. You do not have to partake in his downfall.\n\nIf you want to give them some funds to keep them off the streets, then it's between you and your wife how much to give and where the cut off line is, but they are not entitled to anything.", "NTA \n\nYour brother has some nerve!!!\n\nIf he knows where you live, please get surveillance cameras around your house, if you don't have them already. Protect yourself and your wife. Block his number and the church member(s) from contacting you, whether in person or on the phone. \n\nYou don't owe your brother a dime. He is irresponsible for the choices he made and that's not your responsibility.", "NTA. Honestly, most of this is irrelevant. You don't have to help him, you don't want to help him, and it's not really feasible for you to help him. It doesn't sound like you two have much of a relationship so just tell him no, stick with your answer, and refuse to discuss it with anyone else.", "NTA\n\nThe church can help your brother.", "NTA\n\nThe cult is trying to get your money and house. This is how cults work. They drain their members of any and all resources they have (which is why your brother has no money of his own). Then they get their members to try to get whatever they can out of family, friends, work associates, anyone. If you give your brother money, that will go directly to the cult. If you let them move in with you they'll try to convert you to the cult, try to find ways to get money out of you, etc. Do not give them anything.\n\nI would say, if you want to help your brother that's admirable. Probably even the right thing to do. But you don't have to do that by giving him money or a place to stay. Make it clear he's never getting those things out of you under any circumstances, but if he wants to talk you're there for him. Cults work by isolating members from the rest of society. The way to get someone out of a cult is by breaking that isolation and showing them they can exist apart from the cult. That starts by having a relationship. You're under no obligation to do so, but if you want to help your brother, the best thing you can do is just talk with him and let him know that there is a life outside of the cult.", "NTA.

Stay strong and stand your ground.", "NTA \ud83e\udd23nice comeback with the Cain comment. That said no you are not responsible for your nieces and nephews it is sad what they are going through however that is not your fault your brother and his cult should have remembered Jesus telling the priest render to ceaser what belongs to ceaser and render to God what belongs to God. Not precise but you get the gist.  Paying taxes suck but losing you home and land is worse.", "I understand that you don't want to help someone who has clouded views on life, and your brother had no need for you until his world came crashing down. I find it amazing that people that don't know you have a say in how you should help someone they consider one of them. I can't say that you're and AH, because I don't know you or your brother that well. It looks like the two of you are not close (probably because of his beliefs) so, apparently you aren't the only family member that feels he is not looking for help, but handouts. If he has not safeguarded this from happening to his family before, how is going to keep it from happening again?  Hope you won't have to continue to be harassed by the cult.", "NTA, as you said, it's your wife's money to use as she chooses. Your brother chose this lifestyle, he should figure out a way to dig himself out of the hole.", "NTA. \n\nHe judges the hell out of you (haha) until he needs help, and then he's suggesting modifications to your house and upend your life and your wife's work, to accommodate him. \n\nWhen you express the inability to do so, then it's right BACK to \"you're no family to me\".  \n\nThat tells me that you never were, until he needed help. \n\n\nBesides - the only reason you'd want cult members in your house is the ability to instill in the kids that there's a normal world out there, for better or for worse, but that will certainly come at a very high cost to you. \n\n\nYou might want to remind him of Galatians 6:7: \n\n*Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he will also reap.*\n\nOr Job 4:8:\n\n*According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity\nand those who sow trouble harvest it.*\n\nOr Proverbs 11:18.\n\n\nIn short - you'll preserve your own peace of mind, and that of your wife, by not allowing them anywhere NEAR your house!\n\nI feel bad for the kids though.", "Here is the thing. Something might not be your responsibility or your trouble but sometimes doing the right thing is not about you but about them.\n\nI would not do ANYTHING that will benefit their cult.

You've already lost your Mom and Dad to the cult... can you save any of your nieces or nephews? Maybe take a couple in and get them in school? Sports?\n\nMaybe make financial assistance based upon both he and his wife getting paid jobs? \n\nJust some thoughts...", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m afraid your brother sounds really entitled, I would cut all contact", "Consider haloing him with money to pay the back taxes to save his house. It will be an ongoing catastrophe otherwise.", "So the sanctimonious cult cheated with their taxes? \n\nWhere does the Bible stand on that? \n\nNTA - your brother no doubt considers you a sinner who'll go to hell, and yet he wants your dirty sinful money? Aren't hypocritical Christians just the best?", "NTA the amount of people who suddenly become family when money enters the equation is astonishing.  You aren\u2019t responsible for your brother\u2019s mistakes. \n\nAlso, *I wish I could be as good a brother as Cain* is just about the best comeback in this situation. Thanks for the laugh!", "NTA.

No way do you want cultists moving into your home.  \n\nIf you wanted to do something, only to prove he's not reliable,  offer him a loan of $1000.

Nope - walk away.", "You think I can just sign minor that I have no relationship with who are home schooled into sports or an education system.

I'm assuming he doesn't have a job so you'd have to feed them all too. Besides, you'd have to listen to all his cult crap while he was there. He'd also be very upset that his kids would be getting corrupted.  Having TV, being in the same house as a non-subservient woman, eating store bought food, attending public school etc. You know, all that stuff that's responsible for the downfall of civilization.", "Definitely NTA. You and especially your working wife are seen as sinners by him and his family. Always love how the holier-than-thou people will call any and everyone sinners but sit take that sinners money. Also him moving in was never going to happen for 2 big reasons. #1) Once they get in you would have to use the eviction process to get them out while they try to take over your home. #2) They will be relentless once in your home trying to recruit you and your wife into their religion. Both sound like nightmares.", "NTA. This is honestly not that different from having a family member with addiction issues (which is a metaphor I use compassionately, as a person with family addiction issues). The need will never go away, because the cult is likely draining his money. It\u2019s so hard to tell family no, but as long as the black hole for money is in his life, the situation won\u2019t change. It won\u2019t be a one-time assist.", "NTA...\n\nBut after the Cain comment, it would be even more hilarious if the cult was \"sovereign citizens\" and they were getting tagged for taxes..........I would sit there with a bowl of popcorn and enjoy the show haha", "NTA  NO means no and his problems are his own!", "NTA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "NTA.
