My sister doesn't have a father in her life. It's a long story but to sum it up he's not in his right state of mind due to drug usage and has been in and out of our lives since my sister was born. We haven't seen him in years. Due to this issue i have stepped in to help my mom the best I can with raising my sister. Cooking, babysitting, putting her to bed, etc. My sister and I don't share the same dad but I am also not close with my father although I do talk to him and see him every few weeks. I don't live with him because I don't have my own space in his house.\n\nSecond. My mom is a recovering alcoholic. She also smokes large amounts of marijuana daily and even admitted to doing coke not that long ago. She has been sober for a few months and regularly goes to AA meetings (at least 5 days a week). \n\nThird. My mom recently lost her job which caused us to have to move in with my grandmother 67(f). My mom and grandma have never had a good relationship.\n\nFourth. I am a senior in high school. Due to my home situation I have struggled a lot in school and just recently got my stuff together and am planning to go to college. I wake up at 6 am everyday and get home around 3. Four days a week (including Saturday and Sunday) I go to work for about 2-4.5 hours and get home between 8-9 at night. I generally pay for my own lunches, and food except for when I'm working (we are given dinner there). I also buy most of my own hygiene products, clothing, and pay for all of my own outings. When I'm not working my mom will usually make some sort of simple pasta dish for dinner (literally just pasta with butter or Mac and cheese. Rarely is there anything else included).\n\nI am also my mother's biggest sobriety supporter. Since the beggining I have celebrated every milestone, listened to anything and everything she needs or wants to talk about, helped with my sister so that she can go to meetings, etc. But it's getting to be a lot. \n\nLastly. I don't have my license. Due to my mom's previous job she constantly had to be nearby or at home. She wouldn't even drive half an hour away to bring me to the closest driver's ed class. So I have to constantly rely on other people to get me to and from work.

She then told my mom about my issue. My mom then told me that we needed to talk in private.\nImmediately when I started explaining my feelings to my mom she tried to invalidate them by telling me all of the \"reasons\" why I should do it (bringing up things like how she drives me to work and once a week to the bank to cash my check). I mentioned to her that I have been extremely busy lately between school and work and those nights are precious to me because it's really the only time that I have to myself. She snapped at me and told me \"If you can't handle it maybe you're not ready for a job\" (something she has said to me multiple times before out of pure spite). After some back and fourth, I tried to say something and she started yelling at me. She yelled at me, saying that I've become a spoiled, selfish girl. She told me that if she only goes to meetings 4 days a week instead of 5 that she'll start drinking again. She then started mocking me (making fake baby cries like \"was\" \"waa\") Everytime I would point something out that she wasn't taking into consideration.\n\nHer final blow was when she grounded me from going to work for the next week. Not only does that cut off my income but it also screws up my boss and coworkers because we are understaffed. \n\nI know that this was long but I really appreciate anyone who read this. And please feel free to be completely honest with me. I genuinely want to know your opinions. So, am I the asshole?", "You need to loop your grandmother into all of this.  Your mother is NOT sober.  She is using marijuana and coke as her drug of choice.  You need a support system to help you finish HS, graduate, and move on to your own life.  Your sister needs a stable and positive environment and it\u2019s not your mother.  \n\nPlease talk to your grandmother. Talk to your school counselor or a teacher.  Let your boss know you are trying your best.  Please keep being strong and doing all that you are doing to improve your life.

And from what you're describing, even a first\".\n\nYou're only 17 and you're already handling way more than you should. Your mother is trying to manipulate you by guilt-tripping you. Her daughter is her responsibility, not yours. It's nice of you to help, but you're not the mom and you shouldn't sacrifice your life to take care of her. That's what she's supposed to do.", "Words cannot begin to describe how much I appreciate everyone's support. Your words and opinions truly mean a lot to me. Thank you all so much", "What a mess.  Nta, you are living with an addict and life is chaos.  None of this is fair and none of it is your fault.  Punishing you by not allowing you to work is insanity.   It may help to to talk to your school counselor.", "NTA but you are being abused.  You're being parentified, emotionally abused, and financially abused.  She can't ground you from going to work. Refuse to accept that. That's designed to keep you financially dependent so you can't leave.  Go to work or risk getting fired.  See if coworkers or friends can give you a lift.  If not check into public transportation or walk (i know it sucks but do what you have to to get out).  Also your dad's would probably be better even if it's crowded and you have to share a room.  For the record your mom isn't sober.  She just traded one drug for another.", "NTA, but unfortunately your sister needs you, as you\u2019re the only responsible person in her life right now from the sound of it. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t really need you to put her to bed though, as that\u2019s kind of a luxury extra, not an essential. She can brush her teeth and hop into bed when she sees fit. Neither of you really have parents or guardians, so why worry about things like this?", "NTA. Look up parentification.", "NTA. Parentification. Don't let your mom take advantage of you. Don't give her an inch. Addicts are very manipulative people because their priority is their addiction. Helping your mom just allows her to prioritize it more. Look out for your little sister. Take care of her how you can. But don't help your mom, if that makes sense.\n\n\nIf I were you, before leaving for college, I'd do my best to fill your sister in on the situation in an age appropriate way. Unfortunately, It sounds like she is going to be fending for herself a lot. As much as that sucks, she will be better off if you can prepare her for it the way that only an older sibling can.", "NTA, I don\u2019t have the words to articulate this, other than that your mom needs to grow tf up", "NTA, it's not like your mom is tired from work, does she do anything all day?  I would also be concerned about cocaine.  If she mentions it again (odd she would tell you about it in the first place) she may have a problem.\nI probably have an unpopular opinion on her cannabis use, but I used it to quit drinking and now have absolutely zero desire to drink .  I never went to meetings or anything, but I was an alcoholic for at least 15 years.  Somehow I never got arrested or lost my job, but it was a big factor in my first wife leaving.  I use it only after work and only if nothing is going on that requires me to drive, and it just totally relaxes me and makes me see life in a much more positive light.  Sounds like your mom is going overboard with it, but if she's honestly not drinking, it's definitely the lesser of two evils.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is making you do the mothering of your younger sibling. It's parentification and it is abuse. \n\nShe had two kids when it sounds like she shouldn't have had any. Her failings are not your fault or your responsibility. You can leave soon.
