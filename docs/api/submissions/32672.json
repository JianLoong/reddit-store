We have lived seperately while dating however for our next stage in our life we got a 2 bedroom condo that we stay at, I have owned two small domestic short hair cats one being 7 years old and the other being 4 years old. They are very much bonded to me and typically stay out of trouble. My partner knew that I owned these cats and would stay over while we were dating (she reduced staying over while in her 1st/2nd trimester due to her allergies) we are now moved in and this has caused her to not stay here and telling me to foster or re-home the cats, she has admitted that its her allergies but also she is not a \"pet person\" and hasn't lived with pets all her life and hates cat hair. She wants to me adopt out my cats who I love. I may be the asshole because I am not fully willing to re-home my cats for my pregnant girlfriend\n\n1. these are the actions I took that I should be judged on 1. I clean the litter always, 2.I bought anti-allergy food for the cats 3. The cats are not allowed in the bedroom 4. I vacuum often and brush the cats  5. I contacted her OBGYN about the issue in which her OBGYN advised against an over the counter allergy medication like Zyrtec or a Netti pot or nose spray 6. I have reached out to a family member to potentially foster my bigger cat with the possibility of adoption if he does well in the environment 7. Will buy an anti-allergy shampoo.\n\nEDIT  Sorry for typo what I meant was I reached out to her OBGYN who suggested that she takes an OTC medicine to help with allergies. she listed out ones she can take, my partner refused.  \n", "created_utc": 1702131682, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18eelgl/aita_for_not_rehoming_my_cats_for_my_pregnant/", "score": 285, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You and your cats are a package deal. She can live with you and your cats or she can leave.\n\nThis is a HER problem, not a you problem. Don\u2019t make it an issue for you.

As others have mentioned, this is something you both should have hashed out prior to moving in together, not just assumed, and LONG before bringing a child into this situation.

Good luck, you both will need it.", "You\u2019re going to get stuck paying child support and every other weekend visits with your daughter.", "ESH. You two don't seem compatible in the long term. \nThis conversation should have happened before you moved in together. While I would never re-home my cat for anyone,  it's really not advised to take any medication while pregnant due to the limit of data available and as others stated,  it is likely your child will also have allergies.\n Are you going to dose your infant with allergy medicine if that's the case? Do you expect your partner to do the same to exist comfortably in their own home? That's kind of unrealistic.", "Beyond me how someone can have pets and date someone who doesn\u2019t like pets.

Mom knew he had cats and even was fine with the cats, until she got pregnant.  She literally  was cool. Baby could very well have zero allergies, and this man will throw his cats away, for what???? A woman that doesn't  like pets now that she is pregnant.  She should have disclosed all of this before she decided to get pregnant.  Sorry, pets are for life. And if not. Never own any animal.

She knew you had cats, did she think they'd magically disappear?\n\nHow much of this is truly allergy, and how much is not liking cats?\n\nIf it's the former, you may not be compatible.\n\nNTA, animals are family and when you adopt an animal it's a commitment.", "Why are you living together and why is she pregnant?\nBaby's health and well  being Should be the most important thing to both of you right now.\n\nCat litter is a problem. Allergies are a problem. Her mental health and living a stress free life is important.\n\nSo again I ask. Why are you even together? And why is she pregnant?", "ESH. Who in their right mind gets pregnant without ever having lived together in the first place? That\u2019s completely irresponsible to start with. \n\nAnd in second place, the pet situation should have been sorted out BEFORE you moved in together. I get the feeling your partner isn\u2019t allergic, she just really doesn\u2019t like pets.\n\nSo now it\u2019s down to finding a solution. No matter how much you love your cats, (I have had cats all my life myself, we currently have 3), you should love your partner and unborn child more. If that isn\u2019t the case, that\u2019s quite telling, IMHO.\n\nAt the same time, your partner should be completely honest about whether she really is allergic or not. She should love you more than her aversion for cats, unless she really is allergic or has a phobia.\n\nA compromise could be that you live with the cats for a couple of months and try to get her to bond with them. If she really still hates them, you find them a wonderful home, together.\n\nEither way, you are both very irresponsible and immature, which doesn\u2019t bode well for parenting together.", "NTA.  Why won\u2019t she try allergy medicine? I was \u201callergic\u201d to cats until I lived with them.  I had to take allergy medicine at first, but my symptoms improved and now I\u2019m fine.  I\u2019m not saying the same would be true for your gf, but not even willing to take allergy medication (that her OBGYN approved) is odd to me.", "ESH for dating someone and having a baby with someone with an incompatible lifestyle.

This discussion needed to happen well before you two began having children. It sounds like your partner downplayed their feelings about the cats, and if so, that\u2019s absolutely not fair to you. But I\u2019m not sure what compromise looks like here. You honestly seem to be trying, and she\u2019s giving nothing. But she\u2019s also carrying your child. I do find it annoying that she refuses to take medication for her allergies, but that\u2019s also her choice to make. I\u2019m a big proponent of sticking with your pets, but I feel like your partner moving in without liking them has already done a great disservice to their care.", "Whether you're the AH is so far from the point in your situation.

But giving the cats to a friend or family member and visiting them is probably way cheaper than child support and lawyers.  \n\nWorry less about who is \"right\" and more about what consequences your choices will have, financially, legally, and socially. But in the end, it's your life. If you want to pick the cats over the pregnant gf, it's your choice.", "ESH\nI mean.. it\u2019s a health issue so, on top of being extremely uncomfortable due to pregnancy she has to deal with allergies on top of that - and say what you will about allergy medicine, I wouldn\u2019t take anything while I was pregnant. And then it will still be uncomfortable while breastfeeding the baby \nYou two shouldn\u2019t have moved in together if you weren\u2019t willing to rehome the cats. Ideally you should see if a friend or family member can take them that way you can still see them.", "NTA! Your girlfriend is the asshole! RUN!!!!!!!!! You will 100% regret rehoming your cats. They give you unconditional love.... you and your girlfriend might not stay together. She sounds controlling, so what's next? Also, I would not want her there alone because she will get rid of them when you aren't around. Watch out!!!!!!!", "If I were in this situation, I'd honestly feel sort of baby-trapped, and that the situation is being used as an easy way to get rid of your cats.  She stayed silent (enough) about it until she had a reason that would look blameless from the outside...  That doesn't seem like great life partner material to me.  That's someone who is willing to trick or trap you.  That behavior doesn't happen just once. But to my real point- even if you feel like you could rehome them in the perfect situations tomorrow, and everyone would be happy, my question... what's next on the list?  What situation will your partner quietly suffer through until she just decides 'it has to go' or... just does it herself? Cats are living things with preferences, personalities, likes and dislikes, and bonded friends.  But there are many people who think nothing of killing them or abandoning them to death or abuse because they simply don't care.  My concern firstly is that your partner will try to take care of the 'problem' (Which she created, by the way, by staying in a relationship where she was unhappy) herself, but then also, what will it be after that?\n\nWhat if that happens when your kid is born and parenting isn't as much fun as she thought it'd be? Or home, or family, or career, hobbies... it could be anything. I'm sure people will find this extreme, but this is not only about the cats (again, living breathing individuals who existed before this relationship) but this really indicates a whole other problem; *the fact that your partner is willing to stay quiet about things that bother her until she thinks she can act and force change against your will*.  That's not how healthy relationships work. To be a good partner, you have to communicate.  All the people in the relationship have to communicate.  And that goes 100x over for parents!\n\nIf she stayed silent on this and is now trying to force a major change out of the blue without working with you at all-what kind of parent is she going to be?  I'd be thinking I'd be better off having a seperate home so my kid can at least have some space away from that kind of behavior.\n\nFinally, regarding people commenting that OP doesn't care about partner/child over his cats... never in the post did he say he loved her.  This sounds like an accidental pregnancy-no judgement and no hate.  (I was an accident and am glad I got a chance. Not sure why people act like it's a sin or a horrible revelation.)  But what most people these days do instead of lovelessly marrying a partner they dislike out of some misguided honor system is break up and figure out how to coparent apart.\n\nYou're NTA...  But I think you would be if you stayed with her.  Maybe she'll make a better co-parent, but she definitely doesn't seem like someone I'd want to be partners with, or definitely not same-home parents with.  She's shown that she is not, at heart, honest about things, and that she doesn't want to work with you on solutions... indicating that compromise was not her goal.", "NTA It's their home. Pets are a lifetime commitment. Your girlfriend should have made all this known before agreeing to move in.", "Don\u2019t rehome your cats. They are your family.", "ESH - the cats hould have been discussed prior to co-habitating or even getting in a serious realtionship if the cats were a hard boundry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA -  now that you are in it getting rid of the cats is the only viable option. picking your cats over your GF/kid is insanely selfish. The cats will be fine, your relationship with your child and GF is a million times more important.", "NTA\n\nGet a Roomba, and if you having cats was a deal breaker, she needed to say so while you were dating.\nIt's not reasonable to wait until you're having a baby together and moving in to say she won't live with them.\n\nI'd have more understanding if her allergies were newly developed or something (that happens), but also, a daily allergy med goes a long way.", "YTA. Cannot believe there are people who thinks an animal is more important than their future kids and mother of their children.", "NTA. She refuses to take allergy medication?\n\nPets are family. It\u2019s kind of nuts to me that people will have major unresolved issues like this about basic values and how to live and be together, but be speed running to an irrevocable and permanent legal and financial yoke like having kids. \n\nHer being pregnant hardly has relevance here.
