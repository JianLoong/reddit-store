We have lived seperately while dating however for our next stage in our life we got a 2 bedroom condo that we stay at, I have owned two small domestic short hair cats one being 7 years old and the other being 4 years old. They are very much bonded to me and typically stay out of trouble. My partner knew that I owned these cats and would stay over while we were dating (she reduced staying over while in her 1st/2nd trimester due to her allergies) we are now moved in and this has caused her to not stay here and telling me to foster or re-home the cats, she has admitted that its her allergies but also she is not a \"pet person\" and hasn't lived with pets all her life and hates cat hair. She wants to me adopt out my cats who I love. I may be the asshole because I am not fully willing to re-home my cats for my pregnant girlfriend\n\n1. these are the actions I took that I should be judged on 1. I clean the litter always, 2.I bought anti-allergy food for the cats 3. The cats are not allowed in the bedroom 4. I vacuum often and brush the cats  5. I contacted her OBGYN about the issue in which her OBGYN advised against an over the counter allergy medication like Zyrtec or a Netti pot or nose spray 6. I have reached out to a family member to potentially foster my bigger cat with the possibility of adoption if he does well in the environment 7. Will buy an anti-allergy shampoo.\n\nEDIT  Sorry for typo what I meant was I reached out to her OBGYN who suggested that she takes an OTC medicine to help with allergies. she listed out ones she can take, my partner refused.  \n\n\nFurther edit she doesn't go into the room with the litter box and I clean the litter always before and during pregnancy I would never have her clean the litter box ", "created_utc": 1702131682, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18eelgl/aita_for_not_rehoming_my_cats_for_my_pregnant/", "score": 881, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My doctors say Zyrtec, Flonase and Benadryl are perfectly safe for me in 3rd trimester.", "NTA. She knew what she signed up for. SHE has a choice to make, not you. You and your cats are a package deal. She can live with you and your cats or she can leave.\n\nThis is a HER problem, not a you problem. Don\u2019t make it an issue for you.

As others have mentioned, this is something you both should have hashed out prior to moving in together, not just assumed, and LONG before bringing a child into this situation.

Good luck, you both will need it.", "You\u2019re going to get stuck paying child support and every other weekend visits with your daughter.", "ESH. You two don't seem compatible in the long term. \nThis conversation should have happened before you moved in together. While I would never re-home my cat for anyone,  it's really not advised to take any medication while pregnant due to the limit of data available and as others stated,  it is likely your child will also have allergies.\n Are you going to dose your infant with allergy medicine if that's the case? Do you expect your partner to do the same to exist comfortably in their own home? That's kind of unrealistic.", "Beyond me how someone can have pets and date someone who doesn\u2019t like pets.

Mom knew he had cats and even was fine with the cats, until she got pregnant.  She literally  was cool. Baby could very well have zero allergies, and this man will throw his cats away, for what???? A woman that doesn't  like pets now that she is pregnant.  She should have disclosed all of this before she decided to get pregnant.  Sorry, pets are for life. And if not. Never own any animal.

She knew you had cats, did she think they'd magically disappear?\n\nHow much of this is truly allergy, and how much is not liking cats?\n\nIf it's the former, you may not be compatible.\n\nNTA, animals are family and when you adopt an animal it's a commitment.", "Why are you living together and why is she pregnant?\nBaby's health and well  being Should be the most important thing to both of you right now.\n\nCat litter is a problem.

Who in their right mind gets pregnant without ever having lived together in the first place? That\u2019s completely irresponsible to start with. \n\nAnd in second place, the pet situation should have been sorted out BEFORE you moved in together. I get the feeling your partner isn\u2019t allergic, she just really doesn\u2019t like pets.\n\nSo now it\u2019s down to finding a solution. No matter how much you love your cats, (I have had cats all my life myself, we currently have 3), you should love your partner and unborn child more. If that isn\u2019t the case, that\u2019s quite telling, IMHO.\n\nAt the same time, your partner should be completely honest about whether she really is allergic or not. She should love you more than her aversion for cats, unless she really is allergic or has a phobia.\n\nA compromise could be that you live with the cats for a couple of months and try to get her to bond with them. If she really still hates them, you find them a wonderful home, together.\n\nEither way, you are both very irresponsible and immature, which doesn\u2019t bode well for parenting together.", "NTA.  Why won\u2019t she try allergy medicine? I was \u201callergic\u201d to cats until I lived with them.  I had to take allergy medicine at first, but my symptoms improved and now I\u2019m fine.  I\u2019m not saying the same would be true for your gf, but not even willing to take allergy medication (that her OBGYN approved) is odd to me.", "ESH for dating someone and having a baby with someone with an incompatible lifestyle.

This discussion needed to happen well before you two began having children. It sounds like your partner downplayed their feelings about the cats, and if so, that\u2019s absolutely not fair to you. But I\u2019m not sure what compromise looks like here. You honestly seem to be trying, and she\u2019s giving nothing. But she\u2019s also carrying your child. I do find it annoying that she refuses to take medication for her allergies, but that\u2019s also her choice to make. I\u2019m a big proponent of sticking with your pets, but I feel like your partner moving in without liking them has already done a great disservice to their care.", "Whether you're the AH is so far from the point in your situation.

But giving the cats to a friend or family member and visiting them is probably way cheaper than child support and lawyers.  \n\nWorry less about who is \"right\" and more about what consequences your choices will have, financially, legally, and socially. But in the end, it's your life. If you want to pick the cats over the pregnant gf, it's your choice.", "ESH\nI mean.. it\u2019s a health issue so, on top of being extremely uncomfortable due to pregnancy she has to deal with allergies on top of that - and say what you will about allergy medicine, I wouldn\u2019t take anything while I was pregnant. And then it will still be uncomfortable while breastfeeding the baby \nYou two shouldn\u2019t have moved in together if you weren\u2019t willing to rehome the cats. Ideally you should see if a friend or family member can take them that way you can still see them.", "NTA! Your girlfriend is the asshole! RUN!!!!!!!!! You will 100% regret rehoming your cats. They give you unconditional love.... you and your girlfriend might not stay together. She sounds controlling, so what's next? Also, I would not want her there alone because she will get rid of them when you aren't around. Watch out!!!!!!!", "If I were in this situation, I'd honestly feel sort of baby-trapped, and that the situation is being used as an easy way to get rid of your cats. She never said she was allergic, and has even been in contact with your cats without saying anything before.  For your knowledge, everything was fine. She stayed silent (enough) about it until she had a reason that would look blameless from the outside...  That doesn't seem like great life partner material to me.  That's someone who is willing to trick or trap you.  That behavior doesn't happen just once. But to my real point- even if you feel like you could rehome them in the perfect situations tomorrow, and everyone would be happy, my question... what's next on the list?  What situation will your partner quietly suffer through until she just decides 'it has to go' or... just does it herself? Cats are living things with preferences, personalities, likes and dislikes, and bonded friends.  But there are many people who think nothing of killing them or abandoning them to death or abuse because they simply don't care.  My concern firstly is that your partner will try to take care of the 'problem' (Which she created, by the way, by staying in a relationship where she was unhappy) herself, but then also, what will it be after that?\n\nWhat if that happens when your kid is born and parenting isn't as much fun as she thought it'd be? Or home, or family, or career, hobbies... it could be anything. I'm sure people will find this extreme, but this is not only about the cats (again, living breathing individuals who existed before this relationship) but this really indicates a whole other problem; *the fact that your partner is willing to stay quiet about things that bother her until she thinks she can act and force change against your will*.  That's not how healthy relationships work. To be a good partner, you have to communicate.  All the people in the relationship have to communicate.  And that goes 100x over for parents!\n\nIf she stayed silent on this and is now trying to force a major change out of the blue without working with you at all-what kind of parent is she going to be?  I'd be thinking I'd be better off having a seperate home so my kid can at least have some space away from that kind of behavior.\n\nFinally, regarding people commenting that OP doesn't care about partner/child over his cats... never in the post did he say he loved her.  This sounds like an accidental pregnancy-no judgement and no hate.  (I was an accident and am glad I got a chance. Not sure why people act like it's a sin or a horrible revelation.)  But what most people these days do instead of lovelessly marrying a partner they dislike out of some misguided honor system is break up and figure out how to coparent apart. \n\nYou're NTA...  But I think you would be if you stayed with her.  Maybe she'll make a better co-parent, but she definitely doesn't seem like someone I'd want to be partners with, or definitely not same-home parents with.  She's shown that she is not, at heart, honest about things, and that she doesn't want to work with you on solutions... indicating that compromise was not her goal.  If she cannot compromise or do any potential work toward a solution, just her way or the highway-what is living with her going to look like?", "NTA It's their home. Pets are a lifetime commitment. Your girlfriend should have made all this known before agreeing to move in.", "Don\u2019t rehome your cats. They are your family.", "ESH - the cats hould have been discussed prior to co-habitating or even getting in a serious realtionship if the cats were a hard boundry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA -  now that you are in it getting rid of the cats is the only viable option. picking your cats over your GF/kid is insanely selfish. The cats will be fine, your relationship with your child and GF is a million times more important.", "NTA\n\nGet a Roomba, and if you having cats was a deal breaker, she needed to say so while you were dating.\nIt's not reasonable to wait until you're having a baby together and moving in to say she won't live with them.\n\nI'd have more understanding if her allergies were newly developed or something (that happens), but also, a daily allergy med goes a long way.", "YTA.

This woman is dumb for having a kid with someone she's never lived with who has cats. OP is dumb for having a child with a woman who is allergic to his cats but that is a CHOICE HE MADE not just \"a problem the mother has\".

Parenthood changes things. If he can\u2019t adapt to change then parenthood is not for him. \n\nMaybe she thought she could handle it, maybe she could in the beginning, but the further along in a pregnancy everything in your body changes. Tastebuds, cravings, sensitivities, hormones, personality, even allergies. My mom isn\u2019t a pet person, luckily she doesn\u2019t have allergies, we have cats and dogs and we take care of them so it doesn\u2019t affect her. And they\u2019re mostly outside. Maybe GF thought she could handle like my mom has, but allergies change everything. Pregnancy changes everything. You don\u2019t want to put unnecessary drugs in your body while pregnant and breast feeding. Cat litter is dangerous for a pregnant person and the unborn child. When nesting kicks in she\u2019s gonna want a spotless home for her and the child. All of this is normal pregnancy behavior. \n\nGf offered fostering along with rehoming. Maybe things change down the road and the cats can come back. Maybe her friends and family are telling her to get away from a guy who is more committed to pets than his pregnant gf and unborn child. \n\nEvery decent parent makes sacrifices. She\u2019s sacrificing her body, he can rehome/foster out his cats for a while. This man is failing. I cannot imagine putting any pet ahead of my partner and child. I\u2019ve had family rehome to other family members, it\u2019s not the end of the world. \n\nBut choosing cats over a child is going to put that child in therapy for daddy issues for sure. And no judge will force a newborn away from its mother so joint custody will be years down the road, no judge will allow unnecessary meds like allergy pills for pets that could easily be removed from inside the home (maybe they become outside cats most of the day or only limited to certain sections of home) he will have little to zero say in the beginning of his child\u2019s life bc he\u2019s choosing cats over his kid.

He\u2019s bought a condo with her and is having a baby soon. That changes everything. He might not even get to make a decision bc if I was her or was her friend or family member, I\u2019d be helping her pack, sell her half of the condo, and getting a lawyer. This shouldn\u2019t be that hard of a decision for a grown man in his 30s \n\nIf you\u2019re the \u201cpets are better than people\u201d type, then stay single and do not have children. Especially if your children won\u2019t be your first priority. You\u2019re like those grandparents who choose the dog who bites or cat that scratches over their grandkids safety and then complain about not having a relationship with their kids or grandkids. The child always comes first and as of right now the child is growing inside his gf so her needs need to be a priority. So sick of ppl thinking pregnancy is easy or women have been doing it since the beginning of time so suck it up. No, pregnancy is hard and dangerous and god forbid the man who knocked you up have a little of compassion for you and your well being.", "So OP should force his child to live separately from his or her mother half the time because of cats?", "I was directly responding to the comment which told OP to \u201cRUN!!\u201d. I am entirely aware of how cats bond, again, I have many and have grown up with them. I would never EVER rehome a cat unless something happened to require it (and even then I probably wouldn\u2019t). However, a baby isn\u2019t comparable to a pet. If my home was on fire and I could only save a cat or a baby, I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m saving the baby. If my child truthfully couldn\u2019t live with my cat, as heartbroken as I would be, my baby would come first. \n\nMy vote is regarding both parties\u2019 thought processes. OP is culpable for his 50% participation in the creation of the baby and failure to anticipate this issue. His GF is culpable for her 50% participation in the creation of the baby, and her failure to communicate her issues ahead of time.

Mice can and will get in through the narrowest, smallest of holes, and they're always trying to get somewhere where it's warm. \n\nAnd if your cats are halfway decent mousers, you're never going to see more evidence than that, because they will eat those little fuckers up, skull and all.  \n\nEspecially in older houses there's almost always a way in. In mine it's somewhere near the oven, because around August, when it gets cold out, the cats sit in front of it like they're hypnotized. \n\n(My parents' indoor-only cat had to get an xray done and it showed a part of a rodent skeleton in his tummy.)", "Na it all takes is for your indoor cat to find a mouse in the house and eat it, I live in Australia, I have never had a mice or rat problem but one seems to find ways in in the heat every few years.", "Here's the thing, though, it may have been an excuse but it's also completely justified.

OP said she's been around them before and has pet them. That makes it seem like either she never told him the cats were an issue, or the issue was not severe enough to warrant her bringing it up. \n\nIf she's petting the cats, I don't think OP is wrong for not asking her if she's allergic. If you're allergic, you wouldn't literally touch the thing you are allergic too.\n\nI also think hating cats is a silly reason to make your partner rehome two cats. If they're well behaved and she isn't being asked to care for them, what's her issue? Why should they be given away just to suit her? Her hate seems foundationless, and it isn't a valid reason for OP to get rid of his cats. \n\nHonestly, he should consider telling the GF to move out entirely. If she cares so little about him that she isn't willing to try allergy medicine so he doesn't have to get rid of two pets he's had for years and loves dearly, she's not a good partner.", "OK - because you put your dna into someone who doesn\u2019t want to live with your cats. Same difference.", "Which is a major problem since you have pets. Look, you absolutely shouldn't get rid of your cats, and it does seem like your girlfriend might have downplayed the problem a bit until now (or changed her mind more recently).

Cat dander allergies are very hard to fake, it's generally not a sniffly, runny nose, or coughing.  It's more a tissue swelling (sinuses, throat, red eyes) issue.  I'll bet she is not allergic.  I'm sorry you are having a baby with this person because she is manipulative.  I'd be ending the relationship if not for the baby.  You got some hard considerations facing you.  FWIW, if you do break up and share custody, exposing your child to cats at a younger age will minimize the risk that they could be allergic.

If it were because of that, she wouldn't be giving this ultimatum without being willing to try other options. She won't even take a dr-approved OTC medicine! It's because she doesn't like them.\n\nAlso, OP is not off the hook here either. I agree that neither are ready to be parents. But peoples' pets are their family and he is allowed to treat them as such. Also, if her being pregnant while allergic is the issue, that's even MORE of a reason to not give them up, because when she's no longer pregnant it will be less of an issue by that logic. \n\nThis is coming from a cat owner that didn't know she was allergic (as in, diagnosed by an allergist and everything) prior to getting cats.
