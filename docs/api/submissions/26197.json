No. She had the free will to change for her kids or choose not to have kids if she knew she couldn\u2019t handle it, nobody forced her to take the path she did, even if she was more likely to struggle harder, she is still the person who woke up every day and chose to continue to abuse you.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for what you went through and I\u2019m glad you found a safe and supportive family.\n\nIf you feel obligated to respond to your father, just tell him why you called another person mom. It\u2019s not a revenge ploy you\u2019re using solely to hurt her feelings, it\u2019s not some twisted form of psychological game you\u2019re trying to play, but that she was not a good mother to you. She isn\u2019t entitled to your respect, or to you calling her mom. Where she should have been supportive, loving, kind, and patient, she was abusive. Dean\u2019s mother provided you with the love and support any parent is supposed to at a time when your biological mother cut you off and made your life even more difficult than she already had been up to that point. That you understand why she may have done what she did, but that it isn\u2019t an excuse and she still has to deal with the consequences for her actions. Including being cut off from her kid\u2019s life. It\u2019s unfortunate for her that she\u2019s feeling hurt by what you said, but you just told her the truth, you\u2019re done trying to baby her from the reality of how badly she hurt you, and it\u2019s not your responsibility to make sure her feelings aren\u2019t hurt by her having to confront what she did. She raised you, but she wasn\u2019t a real mother figure in the ways that counted. Basically anyone has the emotional and mental capacity to know they should give a child food, water, shelter, clothing, and access to education. Being a good parent is so much more than that. You aren\u2019t automatically a good parent for simply giving a kid the bare minimum legal standard just because there are worse parents in the world. Constantly comparing yourself to worse people to justify bad behaviour is a clear sign you\u2019re not in the right.\n\nYou aren\u2019t responsible for caring for the mental health of someone who has abused you. Regardless of if they gave birth to you or not.\n\nAlso, if y\u2019all are serious and potentially considering marriage in the future, it\u2019s not weird to call your partner\u2019s parents mom and/or dad. Not that you owe an explanation of your relationship status to anyone anyways.", "OP=NTA\n\nSibling once worked at a camp for summer and brought home two international student workers with her.  (they were travelling/backpacking once the camp was closed).\n\nThey stayed with us a couple weeks, decades later, one of those women still refer to my Mom as Mom.  \n\nYour Mom just needs to get over it.", "NTA, I think calling your MIL is pretty common. I can see why your mother is hurt by what you said but I can also see why you said it and the truth hurts", "well him who sows wind will harvest a friggin hurricane. NTA there are cultures were it is pretty common to call MIL mom too.", "NTA, it was just the truth.", "> My dad ended up sending me a very lengthy email on how disappointed he was in me because of that email and that I had really hurt my mom. I feel bad, but I don\u2019t know if I was wrong to call her out.\n\nyour dad don't know about all the hell the put you through? \n\nNTA.", "NTA. If you dad seriously takes her side, cut him off as well.", "NTA - And kuddos to you for standing up for yourself and expressing your own thoughts and feelings. This internet stranger is very proud of you. Keep setting those healthy boundaries and asserting your needs. You have every right to call whomever you want \"mom\".", "NTA. Write dead ol\u2019 dad back and tell him you are disappointed in him for not protecting you from your mom\u2019s abuse.", "I confirm that it is pretty common to call FIL and MIL \"mom\" and \"dad\". I have even seen people having slightly different names for their own parents and their partner's (like \"Mommy\" and \"Daddy\" vs. \"Mom\" and \"Dad\". Absolutely nothing wrong with that, both pairs of parents were loving people and it does not hurt to have an extra pair of persons who love you in your life.", "Mind that you don't fall into the trap of idolising/making excuses for one parent just because the other one also sucks. Unfortunately, I had to learn that my dad wasn't the super great person I always thought he was. It was just that my mother was so bad by comparison that his crap looked good.", "...mind blown. That sadly explains why my dad is *always* receptive to what I'm saying, and then turns around and stays with my mom all the same.", "Right? I'm sitting here floored right now."]}
