Those poor animals deserve better homes than where they are.", "If there is abuse/neglect then absolutely YWNBTA for calling animal control. I would have done it the minute they were over the allowed number of dogs...let alone the dog bite.", "NTA. What are you waiting for, for them to kill a toddler? They're aggressive, one has already bitten your father, they're not cared for and vaccinated so if they DO bite someone, hello rabies treatment....  Turn them in fast. They're already getting out and attacking people, so what are you waiting for? A kid to be hospitalized with half a face?

Sounds like a hoarding situation, get those puppies help.", "NTA. Definitely call animal control if their dogs are getting loose and being aggressive. I don't think animal control identifies who calls in, but if that concerns you, get a TracFone and use that, and give a fake name if they ask.", "NTA call animal control", "NTA\nThey are not properly caring for their dogs, and some of those dogs have attacked people.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your family should have called Animal Control long ago.", "This has nothing to do with anything, but I don't know why you're so judgemental about the dogs being inbred.  They're dogs.  They're doing what comes naturally.", "My dad doesn\u2019t want me to call AC bc he says \u201cwe don\u2019t need enemies in this neighborhood\u201d we live in a small town and it\u2019s very violent here and my dad is older and doesn\u2019t handle confrontation well, my bf and I are moving soon and I\u2019ve also been hesitant due to the fact it\u2019d be unfair for me to stir up something and leave my dad to deal with the fallout", "He didn\u2019t, he isn\u2019t good with confrontation and we live in a bad neighborhood and he\u2019s worried how they\u2019ll retaliate if we aren\u2019t home", "There is a pet supply chain near us that will take your dog/cat and board them and have them spayed or neutered for only 50$ but they have refused. We told them this because they have mentioned previously that vet bills for those services were incredibly expensive", "I just try to mind my business for the most part since it\u2019s a bad neighborhood and I\u2019m moving soon and I don\u2019t want them to retaliate against my dad", "1. I live in a bad neighborhood, like a man\u2019s body was literally found beheaded behind the woods behind my house.\n2. I\u2019m moving soon, I don\u2019t want them to retaliate against my elderly father because I decided to call AC right before moving and leaving him alone with the fallout of the mess I created \n3. I\u2019m trying to come up with a plan that will help the dogs and make sure my dad is safe", "I\u2019m scared they will figure out it was me and retaliate against my elderly father and younger brother after I\u2019ve moved, I\u2019m also afraid that the dogs will be put down and I will have called for seemingly nothing", "I\u2019ve been hesitant to call because I\u2019d feel super guilty about taking the dogs away from their son, who I\u2019ve spoken to a few times but he doesn\u2019t really spend time with them and I\u2019m scared that when my dad is in the backyard by himself tending to the garden their GSD will jump the fence and attack him, as she gets really wound up anytime she sees anyone of us out back and won\u2019t stop barking, jumping and pacing the fence until we leave", "Those are all excellent reasons. A friend reported her neighbors for animal neglect, and in retaliation, they then called the cops on her for everything they could (loud parties, etc.). \n\nStill, NTA for calling; sounds like a real problem.", "In my city, you used to be able to report without giving your name and address. If you can call anonymously, I'd do it. If not, get one of those fake numbers, call from a number away from your house, and call to report. If they ask your name, makeup one. Tell them you were passing by and saw a bunch of dogs, and one of them bit someone. No lies. You technically saw all of it.", "This seems very relevant to the post...", "Make sure the police know this is a concern when you file the report.", "Understood I guess, I just don't want to imaging the life those puppies are leading. Poor babies.", "A valid fear! I called about dogs that were out barking all night every night and the neighbors figured out it was me and threw poisoned kibble into my yard. Other neighbors warned me they'd poisoned other dogs in the neighborhood too. I moved immediately. \n\nCalling about roving dogs is safer, because there is a wider potential group of people who might have called about it. It could even have been someone walking their dog by who didn't live in the neighborhood.", "The dogs will be put down", "Why would you feel guilty if he is not spending time with them? That's part of owning a dog... they require time and attention. Failure to provide those things is negelct.\n\nNone of these people sound like responsible pet owners. Therefore they should not have pets.", "OP, do not feel guilty or bad calling animal control or SPCA on the neighbours. You are not a bad person so NTA. \n\nYou are not trying to ruin a family but you are calling out irresponsible behaviour involving dogs and you are trying to keep your nearby neighbours safe. Plus, this is likely an animal hoarding situation gone terribly wrong that needs to be curbed quickly", "This is what I\u2019m worried about especially since I plan to move soon I don\u2019t want my dad\u2019s remaining time here to be hell (he wants to move to but it will be much longer before he can) will they be able to tell on the report who called? Is it possible to do it anonymously?", "I will try this next time the dogs leave their gate in case they come by looking for them", "There is a word limit I tried to add it In a previous post but it was removed", "Is there not a way to do it anonymously? Because the dogs have gotten out and terrorized several people before. Idc if the neighbors even found out my new address and came after me I just don\u2019t want anything to happen to my elderly father", "Trust I feel bad for them too but I have to put my family first as they will be the ones that have to suffer whatever consequences that come with my actions", "Their inbred dogs leave their property every time they leave for work and their son is at school I was thinking of using that as an opportunity to call AC to report them as strays or something but I\u2019d still have a problem with the German shepherd terrorizing me and my service dog in our own backyard (even if we aren\u2019t anywhere near their fence she just hates seeing us out there)and I\u2019m not sure how to approach that situation because the GS is more territorial and stays to one place", "Which is another reason I can\u2019t just call, because then what was the point in calling? I\u2019d feel better if I knew they\u2019d go to a nice rescue or home where they\u2019d be loved and looked after", "Because he is still a child and he must care about them to some degree or have some attachment to them the responsibility to train and provide for the dogs is on the parents, if it was just the adults I would\u2019ve already called.", "Pardon my ignorance but what is SPCA? I live in a very small urban neighborhood so I\u2019ll have to see if we have that near us", "It should be possible to do it anonymously.", "You can absolutely ask that they not reveal who reported them. Not sure on the anonymous thing, I'd say it's fine. We have an online city page where we can go to report problems, too.", "So it's better to leave a bunch of dogs in a neglectful situation, than to make a child temporarily sad? I understand your motivations, and I feel for the kid, but the dogs' suffering in this situation is far greater than the child's potential suffering.", "SPCA is Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Not sure where you are based, if you are in US it would be ASPCA", "I will look into calling AC the next time the dog get out, it\u2019s mostly the inbred ankle biters that leave the fence when the neighbors leave but the GSD terrorizes my family and I when we\u2019re in our backyard with our other dogs playing with them, she\u2019s even digging holes through the fence and I\u2019m scared she\u2019ll attack my service dog I\u2019m not sure how to approach that situation anonymously", "I didn\u2019t say that, please don\u2019t put words in my mouth as that\u2019s a strawman argument. I have many reasons like the fact I\u2019m moving before the end of this year and this is a bad neighborhood and I\u2019m scared they\u2019ll retaliate against my elderly father. There are multiple reasons why but there is a character limit on the post and I didn\u2019t wanna get banned", "Ok I will look into this, Is their dogs being aggressive and getting loose and not having any veterinary attention enough to warrant a neglect case? Because where I live as long as the dogs are fed and watered and have shelter in extreme temperatures they are considered cared for", "That one you can't. All you can do is try to shore up the fence.", "Uh.... do you know what a strawman argument is? Because you've literally just said that you're hesitant to call animal control because you don't want to upset the son. I think what I said is a pretty fair assessment of that statement, as I do not believe that the feelings of the son are more important than the wellbeing of these dogs.\n\nNow, with regards to retaliation, I think that is a legitimate reason to be on the fence about calling animal control. Is there a way to report anonymously?", "If the dogs are aggressive AND on the loose that will likely warrant the owners to be in trouble with the law and their local city council (do look up your local Dog Control Act)\n\nIf the dogs are also found to have lack or zero vet attention, the SPCA will spring in action in no time", "I said I had many reasons \n1. I feel bad for their son (who is a child and an innocent party in all of this)\n2.I live in a bad neighborhood \n3.I\u2019m moving soon so I won\u2019t be the one that has to deal with their retaliation my elderly father and younger brother will (several elderly people\u2019s homes in my neighborhood were broken into their year resulting in their deaths)\nI\u2019m not gonna jump into making a decision I think will do more harm than good", "The dogs will also suffer if I call, they will likely be put down. Also I hate to say it but the well-being of a handful of animals (which isn\u2019t guaranteed) doesn\u2019t outweigh the safety of my family", "I would feel super guilty if I put them in a worse financial situation though, especially because they have a young son and are struggling to get by. Is there an outcome where they lose the dogs and are possibly given a warning or something? I don\u2019t Wanna be responsible for putting a family on the streets", "I am not entirely sure what the penalties will be on them should they be found to have neglected the dogs to the point they are a danger to others. Do check the laws in regards to this although I understand (sadly) their dogs are likely to be rehomed while the aggressive ones that attack people will be likely to be destroyed", "I have considered offering them money when we move to take their GSD and retrain her"]}
