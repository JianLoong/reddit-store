It's exhausting", "NTA\n\nListening to music loudly in public is bad behaviour. You did the right thing.", "NTA, that's so annoying. That said, you can't win telling a random teenager anything.

Honestly, public transport should have strict rules about this and expel riders who violate them.", "NTA.\n\nEarbuds are a couple of bucks. No excuses. If you can afford a phone, you can afford earbuds.
