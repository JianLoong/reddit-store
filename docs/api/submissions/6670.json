She had her first period over the summer. She was age appropriately prepared for it, but regardless came on much sooner than she anticipated. She\u2019s is a very sensitive kid, getting her period so early upset her. She was hoping it would happen later, not having to deal with it until then. However, several months later she\u2019s ok with it now. \n\nLast week our kids stayed with their grandparents as my wife traveled with me on business. It was supposed to be a short trip, our flight got delayed due to weather which set us back 48 hours. By the time we landed, my wife wasn\u2019t feeling well. I took her home and went to pickup our kids. It was before dinner time, being tired myself I had planned to grab takeout on the way home. My oldest though, said she needed to go straight home first. \n\nShe was walking in the house in front of me, I noticed she had spotted through her clothes. I asked her if she forgot to pack her products, to which she said she did but ran out. Only her and I left for the restaurant, I saw tampons in her bag. I asked where she got them, her grandmother\u2026my MIL gave them to her. She said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to use them and I was scared to try on my own.\u201d She told her grandmother this as well and asked for pads. Her grandmother\u2019s response was to \u2018go figure it out.\u2019 Although, she didn\u2019t even provide her with the box to at least read the instructions. When my daughter became physically upset, my MIL told her to grow up. \n\nMy wife felt pads were the most age appropriate product to give her, at least until she matures more or decides for herself to try another product. I told my wife later, she pretty much rolled her eyes and said we\u2019ll make sure she has enough pads next time. I\u2019m sorry, but that doesn\u2019t fix her mother\u2019s behavior. The next time I saw my MIL, I let her know what she did was wrong and she can\u2019t make decisions like that. She said she had gotten the tampons from my SIL\u2019s bathroom, that\u2019s all they had. I told her I didn\u2019t care, she could have went to the store and I would have given her money if she was worried about that. \n\nJust as I though the talk was done, my MIL threw around the fact that I\u2019m a man and have no business saying anything at all about menstruation products because it\u2019s, \u2018none of my business.\u2019 It\u2019s my child, it\u2019s absolutely my business. She accused me of making tampons out to be something more than they are, then insinuated me being apart of some cult that has strict restrictions over female\u2019s bodies and what they\u2019re allowed to do. Completely dumbfounded, I called her crazy and said I don\u2019t think she should be alone with my\nkids anymore. \n\nThat fueled things, she called my wife. She\u2019s upset that I ended up having words with her mother as she said I should have left it alone.

It wasn\u2019t easy for her at first, even though we tried doing everything to put her at ease. She just finally got accustomed to things when her grandmother tossed her tampons, she had no idea how to use them. She did it in a very rude manner. My wife felt we should let it slide, I did not however and confronted her mother which got pretty ugly. My wife is upset that I started a fight with her mom. There\u2018s usually no winning arguments with her, I know this. But I felt something needed to be said.

First of all, a 9 year old doesn\u2019t just figure out how to put a tampon in, she needs someone to show her. Second of all, if she\u2019s not comfortable wearing one, MIL should have made sure she had pads. Why force her to be embarrassed by spotting because she ran out of pads and couldn\u2019t use a tampon? I\u2019ll also add, I\u2019m 19 and I don\u2019t like tampons because they can hurt, I cant imagine putting one in at 9, especially having no idea what to do. MIL could have at least tried to help her more. \n\nAlso, in response to comments about you being a man and not understanding; yes you\u2019ll never understand what a period is like, but it genuinely makes me so happy to see a man trying to learn and advocate for his daughter!! A lot of guys will back away from things related to periods, but it was great to see how you helped your daughter, when a lot of men probably would just ignore it. Please don\u2019t let MILs comments change what you\u2019re doing at all! Keep backing your kid, she\u2019ll appreciate it", "NTA - it\u2019s not about tampons vs pads.  It wasn\u2019t appropriate at all to hand your child a box of tampons given she had never used them and refuse to help.  MIL should absolutely have gone to the store to purchase pads for her.\n\nMIL\u2019s lack of compassion (telling a 9-year-old to \u201cgrow up\u201d) and refusal to do a quick trip to the store would be enough for me to worry about leaving my child with her again.   What else will she be a jerk about?", "NTA, I was fully prepared to have a go about the \"no tampons\" bit, however I actually read the entire post.  MIL was being lazy and completely out of line. \"Figure it out\"??? Yet you being male precludes you from having any say over your child?  Say what?  Nah, that's not how this works.  First off, you don't hand a young girl a product and tell her to \"figure it out\". Especially one just starting with menstruation.  You provide her with the products SHE feels comfortable with, period.  Even if it means a 10 pm trip to the store, pajamas be damned. (Been there!)  As for you being male and whatnot, you sound like a more modern dad who doesn't get all squicky about women's bodies and the workings (bless you!)  MIL pretty much neglected your child's needs and comfort then tried to \"man shame\" (I guess...?) you for being involved at all.  Nope. That would be the last she saw of my kids.", "NTA the decision to use tampons is up to the person using them and 9 is young as heck. If she wasn't comfortable using them the appropriate response would be run to the store and get pads. \n\nBut you especially don't just give them tampons and tell them figure it out that could literally be a health issue. Were they even the right absorbency for her who knows.", "NTA you did a great job advocating for your daughter.", "NTA. your MILs behavior was unacceptable and your wife shrugging it off is not good either. Maybe she's used to being treated like this by her mother but your daughter shouldn't have to deal with this.", "NTA, 9 is young, oof. Even lite/light tampons might be uncomfortable for her. It\u2019s not really about your decision process with that, it\u2019s the MIL being a complete AH to your daughter about managing her period. Just chuck a loose tampon at a kid and say \u201cfigure it out\u201d??? Who does that?", "NTA. \n\nOh boy, based on your title, I really thought this post was going to go in a different direction. I don't think this is so much about whether or not your daughter uses tampons, but rather about the callous way your MIL treated your 9 year old daughter! Your kid was pretty clear with your MIL about her discomfort and ignorance with tampons and your MIL dismissed her like she was an adult woman who should know what's what. Tampons can be pretty intimidating the first time, even when your not NINE. Jesus.   \nFor the record, you sound like a great dad who's handling periods pretty well, especially when your daughter is so young. Keep it up.", "NTA at all.\n\nIf a child came to me because they ran out of period products, I would ask them what they use and provide that product. I would not give that child a product they don't know how to use and tell them to figure it out and grow up. How does she not realize how fucked up that is.\n\nYou did the right thing!", "Ohhhh boy I'm actually I read this, I gotta mentally start preparing myself for when my own daughters hit this age, which from the sound of it may be sooner than I think. \n\nI am.. admittedly not the most emotionally sensitive at times, but I can't even imagine telling a scared, upset little girl to 'go figure it out' and then \"grow up\"... \n\nEven as a man, sure I might be a little uncomfortable and feel out of my depth but.. I would at *least* freakin google it and do my best. Damn. \n\nYour MIL is a huge AH for that. \n\nI'm not sure that it was your best idea to go lookin for a fight with such a woman, but hey... I'd have done the same tbh. That wasn't okay and it's your child, so you're right.. it *is* your business. \n\nUgh, the whole \"you're a man, it's not your business\" attitude is so stupid, I guarantee there will be women who will agree with that sentiment and simultaneously complain that men are insensitive or clueless idiots when it comes to women's bodily cycles and not even recognize the irony. \n\nNTA op. \n\nYour wife is obviously used to her mother running things and has learned to just not pick a fight, but that doesn't mean you have to live that way.", "NTA \n\nYour MIL sure is. In multiple ways.\n\nShe was inappropriate, rude and dismissive to her young granddaughter, who needed, and ask for her help.\n\nYou're right. A quick run to the store was in order.\n\nThere is no such thing as \"Menstruation Club\". Her comments about you being a man are ridiculous. You are a PARENT. Every action and non action, of hers, in your post. Personally pisces me off. I'm upset for your daughter and for you. Grandmother was absolutely horrible.", "NTA and your wife should be ashamed letting her talk to her daughter like that", "NTA\n\npads are much more beginner friendly and can be more comfortable at a young age. it would be different if your daughter wanted to learn to use tampons properly and had help with that but being denied products she\u2019s comfortable with AND assistance with a new product is neglectful.", "NTA. Your daughter shouldnt use tampons if she doesnt feel comfortable. Pads shouldve been provided for her and your MIL shouldnt be telling a 9 yr old to grow up,this is all new to her and most girls dont get their period that early. I didnt even get the period talk till I was 10 and didnt get it for several yrs after.", "nta, tampons require skill to put in especially when you're so young and might not have good understanding of the specifics of the anatomy you're working with. pads are definitely a better choice because at such a young age your cycle is still not predictable, and tampons run a bigger risk of infection (how can she put the tampon in without instruction and know how long she needs to keep it in? like??).most people that use these products know this because your doctors inform you about it.  your daughter should be using products she feels comfortable with at the beginning until she is ready to move onto using tampons on her own if she ever makes that decision.", "!!!! Also just want to inform you that PERIOD UNDERWEAR exists!! Period underwear is much more sanitary than pads and can be worn for much longer. For a young kid I\u2019d probably recommend that even over pads.", "NTA - You was trying to do the best for your daughter. I would say the way your daughter was introduced to them was not the greatest way and I can see why. You wife may not of understood how your daughter felt.", "NTA\n\nI say this as the parent of a daughter whom started menstruating at age 10. Your MIL is as completely out of line. That said, this won\u2019t be the last time your daughter runs into this situation. Please, get her familiar with a multitude of products. You never know what she may or may not have access to. Over prepared is better than underprepared.", "NTA. You did the right thing confronting her. Your MILs way of dealing with your daughter was absolutely disgusting and I find your wife's nonchalance about it concerning. In my opinion tampons are not suitable for a 9 year old even with a in depth conversation about the possibility of toxic shock and other issues that can arise with this method of sanitary product.", "NTA you\u2019re standing up for a child who can\u2019t speak for herself on this matter. You\u2019re the only one with the power an authority to speak up for her and have an impact on the situation, because when she tried, she was shut down immediately. You\u2019re making sure that doesn\u2019t happen again. That\u2019s good parenting. \n\nMIL can complain all she wants about listening to a man about menstruation, but when that man is advocating on behalf of his daughter based on her own needs and feelings she\u2019s gonna have to suck it up.\n\nAs for your wife, she needs to accept that your child is equally yours and so your child\u2019s issues are equally your responsibility to help with.", "INFO: are you upset that tampons were offered at all? Are you upset about your MIL insensitive treatment of your daughter? This post and title are conflicting.", "NTA.\nYour daughter had never used a tampon before and MIL just threw one at her and told her to figure it out? That is so mean! \nThere isn\u2019t anything wrong with tampons - but I can see why pads may seem more age appropriate considering tampons are more problematic if left in and kids aren\u2019t usually very responsible. \nYour daughter also could have just rolled up some TP and made a temporary \u201cpad\u201d. Someone should let her know that\u2019s reasonable in an emergency when nothing else is available. \n\nIt\u2019s totally fair you were upset. \nIf your daughter was okay to try a tampon, and MIL taught her how - that would be a totally different situation.", "NTA, your daughter felt uncomfortable and Grandma was insensitive and your wife was dismissive. You would think out of all people they would understand your daughters discomfort.", "NTA because you provided context.  The issue isn't that you (the parent) don't want her using tampons, the issue is that your MIL was a real B about how she handled it.  \n\nHanding a 9 year old girl a tampon, and then telling her to figure it out, when she has never used one before and she ASKED for a maxi-pad?  That make the MIL the AH here.  \n\nIF your daughter doesn't wan to use a tampon, all well and good.  If your daughter WANTS to know more about using a tampon, and you/your wife block it?  That would make you both AHs.  \n\nI STRONGLY recommend that over the next year or two you/your wife discuss with your daughter that there is nothing wrong with using a tampon.  ALso, how to use one, some of the options with tampons, and when and what to watch for with them.  Sometimes, when it is an emergency, all you have is a tampon.  Sometimes you are out and about, and Aunt Flo shows, and you don't have a pad, and the gal in the stall next door offers a tampon.  At which point, you say \"thank you\" and you use it.  No matter what.  \n\nSo, NTA here, but YWBTA if you and your wife don't discuss how and when to use a tampon and why someone might choose to use one.  Also discuss when NOT to use one and what to watch for, etc.  It would also be a good time to discuss other options (like a cup). \n\nGood luck!", "NTA\n\nNot gonna lie, from the title I thought this was going to be a \u201ctampons will steal my child\u2019s virginity!\u201d post, so I\u2019m ridiculously relieved that it\u2019s actually a father advocating for the comfort of his \u2014 8- to 9-year-old! that\u2019s really rough \u2014 daughter\u2019s menstrual experience.\n\nOP, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an A, but your MIL certainly is, and your wife is for not backing you and your daughter up. Tampons can be an absolute bastard to use, especially if you\u2019ve never used them before or they\u2019re the wrong size or you\u2019re in tight quarters trying to put one in. I used pads exclusively for over a year, only transitioning to tampons when I was in high school. I use period underwear now; if I need to use a tampon, I get the ones with applicators.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long time since your MIL\u2019s first period, and probably even longer since she was nine years old, so I think it\u2019s possible she\u2019s forgotten what it\u2019s like to be a young girl struggling to deal with their period. Depending on your MIL\u2019s age and cultural/religious upbringing, she might still be in the mindset that periods are not to be spoken of\u2026I think my grandmother would have fainted if she\u2019d had to explain to me how to use a tampon. That doesn\u2019t excuse her dismissiveness of or lack of compassion for your daughter or you, but hopefully as a potential explanation it helps you.\n\nI *do* think that you and your wife should sit down with your daughter and talk about the different menstrual products. Pads, tampons, menstrual cups, period underwear\u2026all of these things have different pros and cons for different people and different body types, and your daughter deserves to have the best menstrual experience possible. If she\u2019s not already experiencing period pain or cramping, I\u2019d advise you all to talk to her doctor too about how to best manage that in the future. Your daughter might be lucky and not experience bad cramps at all, but if she does she will not want to be crying from the pain, or stuck in bed because the cramps are so severe. You need to know now if your doctor is dismissive of female pain, so you have time to find a doctor who will take your daughter seriously when she\u2019s in pain and distress.\n\nBest of luck, OP, to you and to your daughter!", "NTA. Tampons can be intimidating when you first get your menstrual cycle. She needs to be using what she is most comfortable with. Not to mention it's always possible that tampons won't even be comfortable, so having the option of a pad when she first tries them is super important! She needs to be comfortable physically and mentally with the idea of them and it was clear she wasn't. Your daughter should have been respected when she said she wanted to stick with pads.", "Absolutely NTA. I didn't figure out tampons until I was 17 (gor my period at 15) because my mom refused to teach me how to wear them, and I just never bothered because she only bought pads anyway. That was totally inappropriate for your mother in law to react that way to a literal child. Periods are traumatic enough, especially at 9 years old, I can't imagine why she wouldn't have tried to make it as easy as possible for your daughter. Sorry that happened to her, hopefully she knows she never has to wear tampons if she doesn't want to but that she can also talk to her parents about them if she decides too. You're a good dad, OP, good job!\n\nEta: I still hate using tampons, I find them to be uncomfortable and difficult, and I'm 27!", " NTA MIL has no right to tell a child to figure out a period product that\u2019s just callous and cruel.", "NTA using tampons improperly can be dangerous and early on it can be painful too. Your MIL should know that and needs to apologize for potentially causing your daughter harm and also embarrassing your daughter since she didn't have the products she needed.", "NTA, I was that young when I got my period, and was a swimmer.. so I needed to use tampons and actually couldn't. Trying to use tampons was painful. I could only use the ones without an applicator and the very small ones. Wouldn't be surprised if your daughter who is very much a child yet couldn't use them without pain or discomfort. As a woman your MIL should be aware of that... sex is painful the first time for a reason.. same goes with large tampons. \n\nEveryone has their own experience, but as someone that was 9 when they got their first period and thought they were dying because they had no education on it yet, using tampons so young can suck.", "NTA. A 9 year old should not be told to \"go figure out tampons\". I didn't use them til my 20s because I just didn't feel comfortable with it. Every woman has a preference, pads  pants  tampons, cups. Forcing even a grown woman to use a product she isn't comfortable with is inappropriate and your daughters preference is none of MILs business. The conversation needed to be had in case it happens again", "ESH\n\nYour MIL should have been more helpful, and everyone should calm down about tampons.  It could very well be that the kid feels uncomfortable using a tampon because it certainly feels like the adults around her are making a big deal out of it.\n\nWe can wax on about age-appropriate whatever but the fact is the start of her menstruation was decided for her.  By biology.  Now, it's up to you all to give her all the options available to her to make her life easier with it.  \n\n\nedit: I couldn't get tampons as a kid and had to full on sit out pool days at gym thanks to it.  I don't know why on earth people thought it was less uncomfortable for a kid to sit out for OBVIOUS reasons (after telling them a tiny waterproof pad would suffice and having them bleed all over) than to just let them have a tampon.  But thanks, yo.", "ESH\n\nTampons are age appropriate...she has her period, she can use tampons.\n\nYou all failed your daughter when you didn't instruct her in the different products and how to use them.\n\nTampons are great for active young women. There are some great products to use for menstruation, all of these can be used by your daughter. See what SHE wants, not determine what she should use.", "NTA\nMy Bf's sister had her period that young and her mom made her wear tampons cause I guess where they lived they're \"cheaper\" (doubt it, his mom lies alot). She didn't explain any dangers about them and his sister almost got toxic shock because she left one in overnight and it was the wrong size for her flow. \n\nI think tampons should be used when they're older and they have to swim in PE( so like freshman/sophomore year)", "NTA- you should be able to speak with your mother in law about the situation as it went down. You're completely correct that she was neglectful. No real excuse for that.\n\nYour wife may have preferred to address the situation with her mother (and if so what the heck was she waiting for?) But that doesn't mean your MIL shouldn't be able to have an adult conversation with you about why she made the poor decisions she did in the moment. At this point- let your wife deal with her mother from here out- she's not a reasonable person. \n\n Your reason for not wanting your daughter to use tampons is her comfort- which, as far as I'm concerned, is the only valid reason to protest them. I find tampons uncomfortable myself (let me plug period panties, here. They're not completely leak proof- but damn are they more comfortable by far than either tampons or pads. And it's worth looking into menstrual cups too, when she is ready for something insertable. TSS is avoidable...) \n\nAs your daughter is unfortunately on the young side (though my understanding is that many girls are starting their periods earlier than they used to a couple of generations ago) she has all of my sympathy. Please let her know - if she doesn't already - that lots of women feel exactly the same way. We all wish we didn't have to deal with it. And help her learn how to get blood out of fabrics.  Sadly that seems to be a skill all menstruating folk need to master. \n\nAs for your MIL- let your wife deal with her. And stick to your guns about her decision making in this situation being faulty. And her response to you about it was some serious crap.", "Get your daughter period panties.  No pads, no tampons.  Your MIL is an AH.", "NTA. Sorry but you don't give tampons to a 9 yr old telling them to figure it out. MIL didn't take your daughter's feelings into account and do the right thing which would have been to drive to the store and get pads. Your wife should not be taking her mother's side on this.", "Nta. Tampons are a learned practice and take getting the hang of. Size is also extremely important and just giving a 9yr old a full grown woman\u2019s tampon size may be very painful.", "OP soooo\n\nAre you asking if you are the a because you don't want your daughter using tampons or because you don't like how MIL  handled this?\n\n1. Maybe your mother-in-law didn't handle this the best way, but if she's taking care of your kids and that's all they had in the house. Frankly it's a bit unreasonable of you expect her to just run out and get pads when tampons are for the most part very widely accepted as a good hygiene product from menstruating women.  Not everybody wants to run to the store for an item and I'm sure it was not about the money.\n\n2. Yes your mother-in-law could have handled it better with teaching her how to use the tampons, she probably assumed she knew how and she was probably a bit uncomfortable having the conversation\n\n3. You spoke to your wife about your mother-in-law's behavior, your wife didn't think it was quite the big deal and her resolution was to have more pads available for your daughter, this did not satisfy you and you went at it with your mother-in-law. Let's be fair, you probably were not as diplomatic as you could be. Yes it's your daughter, yes mother-in-law could have handled things better, but tell the truth could you have handled things better yourself and that discussion?\n\n4. You haven't mentioned what your concern is regarding tampons. Quite frankly this is really between your daughter and her mother, you might have an opinion but frankly unless you've experienced having your period You have no idea as to what is easier or more difficult to work with. I know women who find tampons incredibly uncomfortable, I know women who find pads incredibly difficult to stay in place for their flow resulting in spotting. Part of it also has to do with their lifestyle, many athletic women prefer tampons to avoid bleed through. There are multiple attributes and considerations here that men cannot fully appreciate because you haven't physically experienced this.\n\n5. So it's okay for your mother-in-law to babysit when you guys go in an overnight trip, you didn't mention anything else that ever suggests a concern in her ability to care for the children, and you and the fight saying she's not to be alone with the kids anymore? That's quite the jump\n\nSo what is your question? What do you want to know you are the a about? How you mother-in-law handled this or that you don't want your daughter to use tampons but you haven't told us why not.\n\nWithout more information I'm going with a gentle YTA, mother-in-law could have handled things a little bit better but you seem to really be going at it disproportionately.", "NTA for being upset at the grandmother, gentle Y T A for not forming a united front with your wife. It's her mom so she should take the lead. Grandmother was absolutely an AH for how she treated your daughter. I completely disagree with other posters that it was ok for her to decline to buy pads or decline to help with the tampons. Both are reasonable parts of caring for children overnight. However, for the sake of your wife, you want to come to an agreement on how to handle her mom going forward. I would be concerned about how she treats your daughter but if this is an isolated incident I would just do as wife says and supply more pads next time. You might also consider period underwear, there are several brands that make children's sizes.", "NTA tampons can cause toxic shock syndrome and there wasn't any instructions for her to read.  Grandma was negligent", "You failed to send enough supplies mil gave what they had you should have spoken with your child and apologized for not sending what she needed.", "NTA- 9 is pretty young to try a tampon, especially without anyone to teach you how they work. Your MIL could have easily gone to the store for some pads, or had them delivered with instacart. And she should not dismiss your feelings just because you are a guy and have no first hand experience, especially as your wife agreed pads were best.\n\nSide note- what a great Dad to not shy away from this topic/pawn it off solely to your wife.", "You were advocating for her. I bet she was pretty upset about it all, I know I would've been at that age too- hell, even now!  NTA for being a good dad!", "NTA. Your daughter wants to use pads and that should be the end of it.

She is a little girl. NTA", "I have no idea what kind of puritanical, back-woods life you've lived but you ARE making tampons out to be something more than they are. \n\nYTA", "Wow. It's rare to see auch a complete case of ESH.\nBro, fix your attitude towards tampons, probably teach your kid to use different kinds of menstrual products AND that she has the right to choose which ones to use, and maybe leave her with some spending money next time.

She had her first period over the summer. She was age appropriately prepared for it, but regardless came on much sooner than she anticipated. She\u2019s is a very sensitive kid, getting her period so early upset her. She was hoping it would happen later, not having to deal with it until then. However, several months later she\u2019s ok with it now. \n\nLast week our kids stayed with their grandparents as my wife traveled with me on business. It was supposed to be a short trip, our flight got delayed due to weather which set us back 48 hours. By the time we landed, my wife wasn\u2019t feeling well. I took her home and went to pickup our kids. It was before dinner time, being tired myself I had planned to grab takeout on the way home. My oldest though, said she needed to go straight home first. \n\nShe was walking in the house in front of me, I noticed she had spotted through her clothes. I asked her if she forgot to pack her products, to which she said she did but ran out. Only her and I left for the restaurant, I saw tampons in her bag. I asked where she got them, her grandmother\u2026my MIL gave them to her. She said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to use them and I was scared to try on my own.\u201d She told her grandmother this as well and asked for pads. Her grandmother\u2019s response was to \u2018go figure it out.\u2019 Although, she didn\u2019t even provide her with the box to at least read the instructions. When my daughter became physically upset, my MIL told her to grow up. \n\nMy wife felt pads were the most age appropriate product to give her, at least until she matures more or decides for herself to try another product. I told my wife later, she pretty much rolled her eyes and said we\u2019ll make sure she has enough pads next time. I\u2019m sorry, but that doesn\u2019t fix her mother\u2019s behavior. The next time I saw my MIL, I let her know what she did was wrong and she can\u2019t make decisions like that. She said she had gotten the tampons from my SIL\u2019s bathroom, that\u2019s all they had. I told her I didn\u2019t care, she could have went to the store and I would have given her money if she was worried about that. \n\nJust as I though the talk was done, my MIL threw around the fact that I\u2019m a man and have no business saying anything at all about menstruation products because it\u2019s, \u2018none of my business.\u2019 It\u2019s my child, it\u2019s absolutely my business. She accused me of making tampons out to be something more than they are, then insinuated me being apart of some cult that has strict restrictions over female\u2019s bodies and what they\u2019re allowed to do. Completely dumbfounded, I called her crazy and said I don\u2019t think she should be alone with my\nkids anymore. \n\nThat fueled things, she called my wife. She\u2019s upset that I ended up having words with her mother as she said I should have left it alone. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Having said that your wife should talk to your daughter & explain different products available. I was never comfortable using tampons however more than once I did find myself in an uncomfortable position of the only available product being a tampon. Let your daughter decide what she is comfortable using.", "NTA. My daughter was 10 when she started her period and although we prepared her for it, she still  struggled, especially at school as she felt really self-conscious.  I showed her tampons and how they worked and she flat out said no.  I don't blame her as I was in my 20s when I started using them.  They can be intimidating. \nI bought her period underwear and I highly recommend them.", "Nta", "No, NTA! Tampons are a perfectly acceptable product if your daughter wants to use them, but inserting one for the first time at 9 years old with no instructions would be extremely daunting. Not to mention that they can have risks if they\u2019re inserted incorrectly or your hands aren\u2019t clean.\n\nHer grandmother treated her horrifically when she was vulnerable and upset, and that most definitely IS your business. And that\u2019s without even touching on the how outdated and harmful it is to believe a father should completely ignore his daughter\u2019s menstrual health. You were completely justified in confronting your MIL, and I applaud you for doing so when the topic can be uncomfortable for some people.\n\nFrom now on, I would advise that you do what you can to ensure your daughter is well stocked up with whatever her choice of product is, and also encourage her to try a few different products once she is comfortable enough to. She may find that there\u2019s another product out there that works better for her. It is also difficult to explain how reassuring it would be to a young girl to know she can go to her father for support for menstruation issues without feeling embarrassed. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing.", "NTA. Also you could invest in some period underwear, at least it won't run out and it's super kid friendly. Outside of that, you did great, MIL will get over herself.", "NTA you and your wife need to have a conversation about what is best for your daughter. While nearly every girl and woman may get their period not all periods are the same some are light as a breeze and some are excruciating where medication if not surgery is necessary. Your mil is out of line and your wife is no better by choosing her mom over her daughter plus. Your daughter should be the one who has a final say in what she wants to use product wise for her periods it\u2019s her body not your wife\u2019s and clearly not your MILs. I do agree with waiting until your daughter is a bit older to try tampons out to see if she likes them or not and whatever products she chooses to use moving forward that\u2019s her final decision to make.\n\nI\u2019m almost 30 and I don\u2019t like using tampons cause they are too much to handle and are sometimes painful both in putting them in and removing them. So yes pads are easier to start with during the beginner early years of getting your period. I will say from experience though the one thing when wearing a pad is that they can sometimes cause\u201ddiaper rashes\u201d so it would be a good idea to set your daughter up with a few portable period cases to keep at school in her locker and one in her purse when she\u2019s out and about.\n\nPeriod case essentials \n\u2022 extra pads\n\u20221-2 pairs of extra underwear \n\u20221 pairs of extra bottoms \n\u2022 a plastic bag to stick the bloody underwear in until you get home to wash it \n\u2022Baby wipes to clean up any mess That was made from being caught off guard if you started period when out or from pad overflowing.", "NTA Most men wouldn't risk the wrath of both their wife and MIL in this instance and I think you're a rock star for doing it! Those women are AHs, I can't believe your wife was so flippant about it! Who TF gives a 9 year a tampon and says \"figure it out\"? Placing them correctly can be difficult even after decades of experience! Plus, they can hurt, cause tears in the vaginal wall, cause an allergic reaction, etc. etc.! Your mil set up granddaughter for humiliation in so many ways (and risked her health) that I'd have to think twice about allowing her to stay with that woman anytime soon. And what she said to you about controlling women's bodies, that's exactly what she did to your daughter! \n\nI don't think I've ever been so emotionally affected by a reddit post, if anyone had treated my baby girl like that you'd have to hold me back.", "NTA but you MIL is. Your daughter might want to try period underwear too. Especially while she is learning, she can wear a pad with these and be more leakproof.", "NTA. I applaud you standing up for yourself and your child. Hopefully your wife will understand when you can sit her down and speak with her.\n\nHow your daughter deals with her period is and should be just between you, your wife and her.\n\nI had a son but if I had a daughter, at 9, tampons would be out the window.", "NTA. Your wife may be used to being mistreated by her mother, but there's no way you should allow your daughter to suffer the same way. It was your MIL who was controlling your daughter, not you, by forcing her to use a tampon without any instruction.

This is your child, her comfort and safety and you absolutely need to protect her, even if your wife will not.", "NTA.", "NTA and I never used a tampon till I was 25 and I had to look up a YouTube video because the box instructions sucked.

In what world is it okay to shove a tampon at a NINE YEAR OLD and tell her to figure it out, and then let her bleed on herself?!? Poor thing. I have nine year old twin girls and this story broke my heart for your daughter. You\u2019re 100% right to limit time with MIL and your wife should be supporting you. \n\nAnd in other news, thank you for being a dad not embarrassed to discuss menstruation and buy menstrual products, and for being an advocate for your kiddo.", "NTA\n\nTampons are not normally used by younger girls who get their period. It\u2019s not recommended because a 9 year old is smaller than an adult woman, including in the vaginal canal. Plus a 9 year old might forget to change it often, increasing the risk of TSS.  IT\u2019s recommended to start with pads, then when they feel more comfortable, they can use tampons and/or a menstrual cup. I got my period at 11, still pretty young. I started using tampons a couple months in because I was in summer camp and wanted to swim but it was very intimidating at first. But I sat out that first day of camp and got teased so I made the choice myself. I got help from a camp counselor(high school girl who was also my friend\u2019s sister so I knew her pretty well.) \n\nI have a friend who is 30 and has never used anything but pads because she felt the whole concept was weird. It\u2019s her preference, it\u2019s her body. No one should pressure a 9 year old to put something in her body that she\u2019s not comfortable with.", "21 CisF, and I use tampons religiously. Anyway. Bruh tampons are rlly fucking hard the first time, I had to ask my mom for help when I wanted to use them due to how heavy my shark week is. I feel so bad for your daughter, she was traumatized from something that can be really beneficial because MIL had no interest in teaching her them. \n\nAs for your and your wife's decision on age appropriate, understandable since your daughter is so young but if she wants to give them another shot and she feels comfortable, don't tell her she can only use pads afterwards is my only advice.\n\nAnyway NTA. However, maybe once y'all calmed down you can talk with MIL? This isn't a NC point, but definitely something that needs to be addressed. The primary concern is making sure your daughter is comfortable with her period and the products she will be using.", "NTA.", "NTA...damn that was wordy, all that about being delayed and dinnertime, really!", "NTA your MiL and wife are wrong. A 9 year old shouldn\u2019t have to figure out how to use a tampon. They need someone to show them. Your MIL should have gotten her pads. It\u2019s deeply embarrassing to be walking around with a blood spot because the adults can\u2019t be bothered to get you necessary supplies.", "NTA: ok so your wife planned on a 48h delay. No likely, what's she planning to buy her 30days worth of pads every time she goes to your mum's. It's not realistic, you and your wife feel that right now with your daughter's age and development that pads are the most suitable for her, and being female I can say if I had a 9y old who was having periods she would \nmost likely be offered pads, if they want to try pads then so be it but the way MIL went about it was horrible. \n\nI think your wife or your self need to go though a few tricks she can use incase she's ever without a pad.", "I was so prepared to call you the AH for a no-tampon stance but firmly NTA here. Your MIL wouldn\u2019t have been AH either except for the way she handled the situation. She half-assedly attempted to help your daughter who is very new to the menstruation process. It takes time to figure out and telling a little girl to \u201cfigure it out\u201d when it comes to tampons is not okay. Your MIL could have guided her or set her up with some instructions at the very least. Tampons are awkward to use the first few times and I personally think your daughter (and any young menstruater) should use them only when they\u2019re ready for that.", "NTA. You're doing a great job as an involved, educated father. It's sad that your wife is more concerned about keeping the peace than advocating for her daughter. I don't know how anyone could not get a nine year old pads after being asked to. I want to give your poor girl a hug.", "NTA. In the world today, it\u2019s just as important for dads to be involved in their daughters issues as it is their own mothers. It isn\u2019t cool that your young daughter was told, by her own kind aka a woman/her own grandmother nonetheless, to \u201cgrow up\u201d when it came to using tampons the very first time. \n\nMost young girls are scared and uncomfortable to try and need support. I think it\u2019s pretty mean that nobody in that house would go out and buy a pack of pads for the poor young girl.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that your MIL now went and called your wife and has now caused more chaos, but you said what you said because you were provoked. NTA!", "NTA. \n\nIf you took out the fact that it was your 9 year old daughter and your MIL, still NTA. \n\nAt 26, if another grown woman asked me for a pad, I would get her a pad. If all I had were tampons, I wouldn't hand her one and say \"figure it out.\" *I WOULD GO GET HER PADS.* These preferences are about comfort during something that is already uncomfortable. It's *NO ONE'S* place to judge that.  \n\nADDING that it's a literal child who is dealing with a lot of changes and body weirdness and a grandmother who gave zero empathy or understanding, very much NTA. Your wife got too used to not rocking the boat it seems. Reiterate to her that her daughter deserved better treatment than that.", "NTA your poor daughter at I struggled with the mini tampons and I was a teenager!\n\nA good idea for next time is maybe getting her some period underwear? They are reusable/washable and she won\u2019t have to worry about running out of pads.", "Absolutely positively NTA. It\u2019s most definitely your business!! Your daughter was clearly uncomfortable trying tampons which are scary especially at 9 years old! Your MIL attitude was atrocious and I\u2019m really surprised your wife isn\u2019t angrier than she is! I\u2019m angry for your daughter!! You were absolutely correct in saying something to her. When her granddaughter wants nothing to do with her because of that kind of shitty attitude she\u2019ll be asking why?!!!", "NTA. Got my period at 9 and was terrified at the idea of using tampons, so I didn\u2019t for many years. Much simpler for a kid to figure out a pad vs a tampon.", "NTA...But on an aside, 9 is very young. And I had family start that young and they said it ruined their childhood, having to worry about pads and blood and developing years before many peers. And the harassment that came with it. Do what you can for her to let her have as much childhood as she can.", "NTA. \n\nFinally it\u2019s nice to see a parent sticking up for their child against a family member.

It might worth looking into OP of getting your daughter some period panties that are for the heavier flow due to her age.", "NTA she's 9. I'm not sure I would want my 9 year old, if I had one, to use tampons. There's risk of toxic shock syndrome and obviously she wouldn't know how to avoid that as she wasn't even told how to use the tampon. I've also known of people getting tampons stuck and that could be traumatic for a 9 year old.

While folks who've never menstruated should stay in their lane when discussing periods, a father's lane absolutely includes advocating for his daughter in all things! My daughter is 9 and an early bloomer (physically) as well, and I am horrified by your MIL. How embarrassing and miserable for your daughter!\n\nI do get why your wife wanted you to leave it, sounds like her mom is a PITA, but I think it's important for your daughter to know it was a big deal and you have her back. Much better than a dad too embarrassed to acknowledge his daughter is going through puberty. \n\nAlso, Google \"period underwear for kids\" because while it can be pricy, it's awesome for that added peace of mind when they're so young.

Apparently, your MIL being a woman didn\u2019t provide her with special insight to know what your daughter needed. Most young girls need help learning how to use a tampon.

If things actually went down the way OP said they did, how can she be OK with how her mother handled this?", "This right here. This is the root of the issue you have with MILs behavior. And it's something to make very clear to your wife- so she can actually get through to her mother- or support you in the correct decision that her mother may not be a reliable adult with which to leave you daughter. \n\nIt's also probably time to have a sit down with you, your wife, and your daughter to make sure your daughter has not only all of the information she needs to now understand about how mestruation works-  it is also vital she understands her options around birth control and reproduction. As she's menstruating- all, full and complete information is now age appropriate. And it's time to look into what all of her options are for dealing with her period. \n\nRegardless of her youth- she's in adolescence now- and conversations about sex, consent, and how to choose good partners when she's ready to seek them out are so important. And so important to have *now*. And to know that she can talk to you, and rely on you is so vital. She needs to be ready for peer pressure and all the bs she's going to face, having this open and important conversation with her will help her, now and going forward. \n\nThe decision about what products to use to deal with her period are *her* decisions to make. Please make sure she has all the information she needs to make those decisions.", "I probably had the same thoughts about the story based on the title. After reading it though I completely agree and think that at age 9 tampons would be a lot to handle and it\u2019s up to her to decide when she wants to try them. \n\nI really want to add that they can also be dangerous if used improperly and I know that before I started using them my mum warned me about them, explained how to use them and made me read the instructions as well. Just handing them to a young girl and not Leistung her at all is negligent.

It\u2019s not just about the tampons, it\u2019s not just about my MIL\u2019s behavior toward my kid. It\u2019s the fact that my daughter specifically asked for pads and was given a rude response and basically forced into deciding to flow freely or use a device she had no knowledge of. I can\u2019t speak for all 9 year olds, maybe some are more advanced/mature on this topic than my kid. I just think my MIL should have shut up and got the kid pads, left them rest to us parents.", "That is spot on advice. Especially about finding a doctor who takes women's pain seriously. Cramps suck they're find that menstruation cramps can be on par with the physical pain level of a heart attack.", "Well, I was the opposite. Mom only used pads, I hated those \"diapers\". Got my period at 12 1/2, changed to tampons at my third. Bought myself tampons ever since and only use them. Except after having my kids. Will teach my girls about all options and let them choose...", "And I should clarify here that I'm NOTsaying you should make your kid use tampons -- I just think you should make both tampons and the knowledge to use them available to her so she can make her own choices.", "Overall yes. What sucks is MIL's approach to the daughter not knowing how to use tampons and not giving any sort of help whatsoever.   \n\n\nMIL should've bought pads and had a talk with OP and spouse about the issue instead of being an even bigger AH about it.

I will never go back.", "I just remember the very weird physical and emotional feelings I had when I work tampons for the first time around 13, and that was after a lot of research and studying the instructions. It felt sooo weird and I haven't experience anything like it since.", "Both. Let me word it like this, I don\u2019t want her using tampons just because her grandmother thinks she should. I don\u2019t want her using tampons because she was obviously scared to, she shouldn\u2019t be forced into trying anything she doesn\u2019t want to (regardless the situation).

We share a tight bond, although she didn\u2019t get her period this young I still had somewhat knowledge about the topic from her.

Not my MIL.", "Are you a woman?? Do you remember how traumatic were the first years having periods? How big everything looked?? I remember having my period at 11 and even teen pads looked SO huge, tampons scared me because I felt that it was going to hurt, actually the first time I had to use one I was like 20 and it was very uncomfortable because even having the instructions, I didn\u2019t put it inside enough because I was scared!!

For saying how you felt and explaining what you want in the future. \n\nYour wife saying that you'll just pack her pads in the future is great for a future for this one incident. \nBut talking to MIL about this is necessary to be sure similar things dont happen again. \nI feel MIL said you dont get an opinion bc she ran out of things to say and defend herself. That's generally when ppl resort to name calling. \nYour wife I assume was just mad bc she didnt want to deal with any attitude from MIL or such.

If she hadn't ever used a tampon I doubt she would have a preference.", "I can tell you that at 10 years old I hated pads with a passion. It felt like sitting in a wet diaper and made the whole situation that much worse. Switching over to tampons was such a relief and made me feel like a had more control over the situation. It has nothing to do with being \"advanced\" or \"maturity\". This feels like you're taking tampon use and making it sexual, which is 100% wrong if that's the case.

In fact, the best \"medical\" option is free flow. But little to no one does that.

The thing is it was a point OP used on MIL to demostrate exactly how callous she was about the whole thing.

Since GMa wasn't willing to explain how to use a tampon it was her responsibility to provide what the child could use without an explaination, which meant getting pads from a store since there were none in the house. You seem to be missing the that point that GMa tried to my way or the highway a little girl who doesn't yet have even 12, as in one years worth, experiences menstruating. Which means based on your first paragraph OP is an AH for expecting his MIL to not behave in a selfish manner and actually watch out for her granddaughter by being the adult. And the girls parents being en route doesn't stop clothing from being ruined due to spotting or a child being traumatized by not knowing what to do. That is a red herring arguement and has no bearing on if OP is an AH or not.\n\nAgreed OP is an AH for going to MIL after wife said to let it go.\n\nNo menstrual products are recommended for first timers for medical reasons, because no product preforms better than the others. I stated that pads are recommended for individuals starting to menstruate because they are less intimidating than shoving a piece of cotton or a rubber cup into your lower abdomen. This is not a medical recommendation, it's a psychological one. One that was given, by a therapist, to my sister when she started menstruating. Think about it. Someone is handed a pad and a tampon and has never used any menstrual products before, which one are they most likely to intuite the correct use of? However you are correct it's all preference, unfortunately OP and his wife are not teaching that from the start. Not sure if that's AH or not, but definitely near the line all things considered.\n\nI disagree that Mom is NTA. Mom is the one who dictated using pads is more age appropriate and that other options will be available if the girl chooses try them later as per the fourth paragraph of the post. That means Mom is an AH too.\n\nRisks are not why no product is recommended for periods. No period products are recommended because none are superior to any of the others in preformance.

Check out period panties!! I wish they had these when I was younger! They are wonderful! They are absorbent, not bulky and no leaks plus they are washable and much cleaner than using pads. They are also discreet and will probably make her much more comfortable. \n\nWay to go, Dad!! Your wife needs to back you up on this one in regards to MIL. Because it\u2019s her mother, she really should be the one telling her where to go. When you do it, you get the verbal abuse and are the villain.

I realized that you had to pull the end of the applicator until it clicked and then use it... I was just pushing the tampon out of it and then putting in place myself for years \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nCan't imagine telling a 9 year old to figure it out.", "I was in my late teens when I started using tampons. I remember thinking I knew what was right but it never felt comfortable. Then one day, lightbulb moment and a different manoeuvre. \n\nThere\u2019s no wayyyyyy a 9 year could \u201cfigure it out\u201d. Took me long enough, even with the instructions,  to \u201cfigure it out\u201d. \n\nMIL is dreadful.", "It's likely how she grew up. She's used to it, Numb to it and just brushes it off. Hard to see a problem if you're always ignoring the source", "What? Not sure I understand your point. Daughter said she was scared to use tampons. And dad went to the store to get her pads. If daughter somehow had figured out how to use tampons and were comfortable with them, I doubt dad would've cared one way or the other.", "Think is the absolute best brand!!", "I bought my daughter a 5 pack. She doesn't need them yet but we are ready", "Different brands carry different types that can have different absorbency levels. Not all period underwear are meant to be the only thing you use. Some are meant for catching leaks from pads and tampons etc. Some can absorb roughly the quivalent of 2 regular tampons etc. If you have a super heavy period, then period underwear will be better off as a backup instead of being the only thing you use. For others with lighter periods the underwear will suffice for the day.", "Yes! You can get different levels of absorbency but you\u2019ll most likely need to change them at least once during a normal 8hr day. The brand I use now makes a style that undos at the sides so you don\u2019t have to get fully undressed but I usually just wear a skirt to make it easy and you can get special wet-bags to put the used pair in.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve also once put a pad over the period underwear (so I could just take off a layer) when I knew I wouldn\u2019t have a chance to change them and it worked great!", "From my perspective it seems like a person who has had one too many futile battles with an overbearing parent and has given up. But\u2026 I could 100% be projecting that, as I have some experience with my own partner in that regard.", "Can I just say, maybe investigate some period underwear as a backup, so that spotting is less likely to occur. As someone who got their priory young, I would have loved if period underwear was available back then. They could go a long way to helping her feel more comfortable. \n\nAlso, when I saw the title, I was sure I was going to vote you the AH, so it was a pleasant surprise to discover I\u2019d assumed wrong. \n\nThe other thing is, SIL may well have had a size of tampons that were too big for your daughter. \n\nNTA. Well done for standing up for your daughter. Your wife and your MIL are both in the wrong here.", "My friend put one in her daughter for her the first couple of times to teach her.", "This is so genuinely kind. Good for him", "My cervix is tilted the wrong way and is low. I never knew that until my dr told me after an exam. It explained why tampons always hurt and why they would start working their way out on their own! I had always been told I must be inserting them wrong. I always thought that was ridiculous because there aren't many ways to insert a tampon...", "I knew a woman who was 21 who had left one in and, I guess, forgot about it? No TSS, but an embarrassing trip to the doctor.", "A tampon needs changing at least after 8 hours or there is a risk of TSS, not weeks.", "Yes...I'm aware (?)\n\nSounds like something a 9 year old might need to know", "Of course he is making it sexual, because the problem for him is tampons are INSIDE the vagina, that's his main problem, he is not going to admit it.", "Did she take note of what happens to Carrie\u2019s mom, who also failed to explain menstruation to her daughter?", "For me it was exactly the other way around. My mom was and still is kind of old fashioned; she likes things the way she used to know them and not any different. I highly doubt that she herself has ever used a tampon. I on the other hand hated using pads ever from my first period, because I found it disgusting to constantly be confronted with all of the blood (also the old pads when I was 12 or so - I\u2019m 40 now - where nowhere near as thin and comfortable as the one today; or at least not what my mom bought). So my mom point blank forbid me from using tampons and definitely would not have been able to show me; I bought my first from my own money and figured out how to use them myself from the instructions. After the first box my mom ended giving in to my protests against pads, and I have stuck to tampons ever since.", "I think I was around 13 from the tampax and I read about it online so I was fine. I think me reading about it beforehand was more important and not awkward", "I'm 30 and have only just been able to start using them, however they are still uncomfortable and work there way out for this exact reason too. My cervix is also tilted and slightly out of place according to my last exam. Never knew this either, no wonder the speculum and smear exams hurt so much.", "To add to this with a personal experience...\n\nHalf asleep, went to the bathroom. Pulled the string, wadded up in toilet paper, put a new one in, back to bed, don't think I opened my eyes all the way the entire time. \n\nCome morning, I thought to myself, lemme go ahead and empty the trashcan, and... there's only a string. No tampon. The string... came off. \n\nI don't want to go into detail. LOL\n\nBut during a rush, in a hurry, half asleep, I can easily see someone missing or forgetting, especially if their period wasn't stable or if life itself is just... hectic and stressful. Or if other things happen and throw the routine or focus off track. \n\nThe human brain is an amazing thing but it's the same thing that lets people walk around searching for their phone while either talking on it or using the phone flashlight to check the couch cushions.", "I was raised by my grandma. All she told me is that it happens and as a girl they had the pads on belts. Lol! My aunt gave me the \"sex talk\": don't do it until you're married. Mmmkay. Luckily, back in the 80s and early 90s Texas was sane and we learned about all of it at school. Including what the boys were going through with puberty. Now it's \"don't have sex until you're married\". So yeah. My kids and I have had long, private chats about everything.", "Ohhh good thought, thank you!", "OP said his daughter isn't as advanced or mature as a 9 year old use tampons\n\nWhat makes a 9 your old more mature or advanced for using a tampon than one that doesn't use tampon?  it's either an issue of preference and or having all information about feminine hygiene products, not an issue of being \"advanced\" or \"mature\". His wording 100% throws me off and like I said in my first comment I could be wrong.", "Yeah, I'm getting the feeling that OP is leaving out information. Why does his daughter feel so uncomfortable about getting her period? That sounds like sus parenting to me. Yeah, a period could get annoying. But the girl is \"upset\" according to OP because she's a \"sensitive kid\". \n\nThat comment AND his admitting he doesn't feel comfortable with her using tampons kinda sounds like he views periods as sexual rather than as a part of growing up.", "Her vagina is not her most precious body part, that should be her brain. Purity nonsense is ridiculous, tampons are fine for young girls, so are pads, so are cups, so are period panties; they should be allowed to make the decision  for themselves supported by information from their adult.", "Conversations about bodily functions were not a thing I went to my mom to growing up. I decided to try tampons in my 20s in college. Read the box instructions, then gave it a go. The first few times hurt like hell and I wound up going to the nurse to see if I injured something. She was sooo nice about it and helped explain different kinds of applicators, how to insert it, where it should be placed, etc, then sent me on my way without going through billing. Looking back, the pain was more about anxiety and panic than physical, and I'll always be grateful to her for setting me straight.", "Maybe she feels bad about the period because he scared her, is easy for parents specially fathers because they know less saying things that could scare a girl, like telling anecdotes about women who are tired of periods or saying that is going to be painful, maybe they do this in a non educational way, and he admit it that he does not care about scare her and told her a story of his sister, he is in fault for her being upset. Is good a father involves in his child but you need to do it right, not just do it.", "Exactly. My dad was worried about toxic shock syndrome, but never made me feel bad about having a period. In fact, he was MORE sympathetic than my mother in some ways because his sisters had bad periods.\n\nWhen people use their child being \"sensitive\" as a reason like OP does, to me that's code for \"I told them a lot of nasty stuff would happen in life and now they can't sleep\". That OR they're projecting their own discomforts and insecurities and the kid isn't really that scared.", "Yeah I mean is right to have Concerns but come on they are not medical(OP did not write anything) they are maybe because his beliefs.", "I\u2019m in Australia. I have never used a tampon with an applicator. By the time school got around to the period talk for girls, iAd had mine for years (I started early). They gave us ones with applicators, and I could not for the live of me figure out how to make it work, and went back to the ones without. So it is possible for people not used to applicators to find them difficult. Here there is maybe one brand with applicators (I say maybe because I\u2019m not sure if they are still around), whereas I\u2019ve had friends who travelled to the US say they struggled to find ones without an applicator. It\u2019s all about what you are used to.", "I am sorry about that and hope you feel better soon!"]}
