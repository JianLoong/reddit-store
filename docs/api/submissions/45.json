My niece (18) came to me this summer and asked if she could work for me while she's in college. My niece is an incredible young woman. She has years of experience, amazing references, and she basically ran a daycare disguised as a summer camp over the summer. I know her previous bosses and they all speak very highly of her. I told her I wanted her to go out and find a job working for someone that isn't family but if her job search doesn't go well, she can come to me. \n\nWithin 3 days she had a job at a daycare starting in the fall. The pay was good and the owners seemed lovely so I didn't think she'd have a problem there. She was supposed to work from 8-10 on Mondays and 8-1 Tuesdays-Fridays. \n\nOn her first day, my niece was told they lost students and they can only have her from 8-10 every day. My niece was frustrated but she said she was nervous about working 22 hours per week while in school anyways, plus she only needs enough to pay for gas and for her to go out every now and then so it's not a big deal. Then they started asking if she could skip class and cover for the other teachers. It wasn't ideal but it was only a couple times a month and my niece said those were unimportant classes so it wasn't a big deal. Over the past 3 weeks, they've texted her right before she was about to come in to tell her they don't need her that day 4 times. On top of that, she just found out that the car she just bought needed quite a few repairs costing close to 6 weeks pay so she needs more hours, not less. \n\nThey did this to her on Friday then again today so I told her I want her to quit and she can come work for me. She was hesitant so I offered her $20 per hour (she currently makes 17) and 20 hours a week. She accepted, I made an appointment for her to get fingerprinted tomorrow, and she stopped by today to pick up her paperwork. She should be set to start by Thanksgiving (hopefully sooner, just depends on how long it'll take to get the results of the background check). \n\nShe told her parents that she's quitting to come work for me and her dad texted me calling me an ass for \"stealing\" her and saying it'll look bad on her resume if she only works somewhere for 2 months. I told him future employers may be curious and ask about it but it shouldn't be a problem if she explains that her hours were cut, she was getting sent home on a regular basis, and she was being asked to skip class on a regular basis. \n\nHer parents still think I'm in the wrong for hiring her, especially because I wouldn't hire their other daughter (doesn't like kids and has no experience), so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.", "created_utc": 1667254323, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yiqk67/aita_for_getting_my_niece_to_quit_her_job_and/", "score": 140, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You didn\u2019t steal her, she wanted a better employer.  Also, there is zero reason for her to put that 2 month job on her resume.  A 2 month gap in a resume is nothing, that\u2019s easily short enough to be a slightly slow job hunt.  You aren\u2019t required to put every job you ever had on your resume, how silly.\n\nI think this is just her parents being pains in the butt because you wouldn\u2019t hire their other daughter.", "NTA. Why would they want their daughter working for people who very clearly have no respect for her time. You did her a favor.", "NTA. Her dad is wildly out of step with workplace norms - it's a job during college that she had for 2 months it's easier to leave over resume and no one cares. The fact is that she was hired under certain pretenses and they were no longer able to offer her those hours he should congratulate her for standing up for herself and finding something better", "NTA. You're helping her out of a bad situation and giving her a better paying and more reliable opportunity. \n\nTell her father there's no need to put a two month job on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9. And even if she does you're right that it's easily explained.", "NTA. You didn't steal her. You gave her an option which was better for both you (I'm assuming you needed an employee) and your niece which she took.", "NTA I really hate that toxic mentality of how people should stay at jobs where they're being treated poorly and taken advantage of no matter what. You did the right thing. She was being asked to skip class, and her education should be her priority right now. And then they'd wait until the last minute to cancel her shift? So basically, she is a student whose life is supposed to revolve around a job where she rarely ever even works?\n\nHer bosses and her parents are the only assholes in this situation. I am grateful she has you to watch out for her, and I'm confident you'll treat her a million times better.\n\nAnd there's a good chance they're only bitter about you refusing to hire the other child. Ignoring the fact she has no experience, which would be reason enough for it to be a bad fit, she doesn't like children? What is wrong with these people?!", "In all but the rarest of circumstances, employers are not assholes for poaching employees. And employees are not assholes for accepting better terms. This is how the market works.\n\nWe should normalize treating employees with dignity by acknowledging they are allowed to negotiate for better terms for themselves. The dad has a ridiculously employer-centric view of the world, and I say this as a fairly conservative individual.", "NTA\n\nYou are helping her. She is also an adult. So, this really isn't any of their business.", "Clearly NTA, competent employers know money talks; you paid more with better hours.", "NTA.  Sounds like sour grapes over not being willing to hire the other daughter.", "A) It\u2019s been 2 months\u2026she can leave the job off her resume entirely\n\nB) While it\u2019s none of Dad\u2019s business in the first place, he just seems annoyed that you wouldn\u2019t hire the other daughter\n\nNTA", "NTA.  She should skip putting that job on her resume.  If someone asks her about it, she should be honest and state she was hired for 22 hours a week, then they kept cutting her hours due to reductions in the number of students and constantly wanted her to change shifts so it financially made no sense.", "NTA. And seriously why would she need to put that job on her resume at all. She's 18 and nobody is going to question what she was doing for 2 months.", "NTA\n\nShe's 18, working someplace for 2 months isn't going to be any issue on her resume.   Her parents are just sour that you didn't hire their other child that's not qualified.", "NTA\n\nYour niece is an adult and she can make her own decisions. Better working conditions are always a good reason to switch jobs.\n\nHer parents are TA though for their interference. Ignore their whining. You owe them nothing.", "NTA you didn't \"steal\" her, she's a frickin' adult. You offered her a more stable, better-paying job opportunity.", "NTA.\n\nIf your daughter develops a history of only working two months somewhere, that's a red flag. If it happens once or twice, no one thinks twice - they might ask about it, but especially as it's further in the background no one cares.\n\nHer previous employer was displaying all the hallmarks of a toxic workplace, so good on you for getting her out of there.

She doesn't have to throw them under the bus she can be polite etc about it and be done with it.

Heck she\u2019s a student, I know adults who take longer periods in between jobs, but I guess they\u2019re a bit more privileged.  But, the point stands, she can leave it off the resume too.", "NTA How Will future employers even know she worked 2 months at this job unless she uses it for a reference?

She doesn\u2019t even need to put that 2 months in her resume. No one is going to question a 2 month gap and if they do, they\u2019re probably not someone you want to work for.

I was employed off and on in college and grad school 20 years ago, and nobody thought anything of it.", "I just want to point out that the niece is 18 years old. Many college students don't begin working immediately. If she wanted to, she could just omit the first employer and no one would question it.", "You are completely right, I\u2019ve only ever been asked why I left my last job, not the timeline of any other ones. \n\nI wish more people realized that you aren\u2019t indebted to your employer and don\u2019t have to work anywhere long term. I started working just under a year ago, am on my third job and have *more then tripled* my yearly income and gained a workplace culture I love and work that challenges and interests me. The best advice I can give anyone is to be literally always job searching unless you have absolutely no desire to go anywhere else. If you want more money, more recognition, more hours or a better workplace culture then just throw your resume everywhere. I\u2019m not classically educated in the area I\u2019m working in but the interviewer loved my energy, gave it to me on a trial basis and I just kept giving shit a go. Google and youtube are your bestfriends, accept every task thrown your way and challenge yourself to master it. Then you have even more skills to add to your resume and new jobs to apply for!", "It's kind of funny how \"poaching\" employees is shunned. If I, as a business, wish to offer a better deal to somebody to buy their time and services, why shouldn't I? It's up to all participants in the labor market to either match the offer or acknowledge they cannot purchase the premium labor (ie. good employees).\n\nIt's perfectly acceptable to poach customers, isn't it? If I offer a better service for a lower price, I will win business. The market will eventually come to an equilibrium.", "As it should be.", "I have no problem hiring someone that is working at another school or daycare if the pay is better but I don't like to contact the employee and offer them better pay and hours if they quit and come work for me.", "This is called headhunting or recruiting and it happens all the time. Good HR reps are constantly looking at linkedin, facebook or whatever is specific to their field to find people with the qualifications and right mentality for their business. I just lost my boss because another company reached out and made her a better offer. Really sucks for us because she was great, but good for her and the new company. Don\u2019t feel bad at all about this, not only are you offering her more money, you\u2019re giving her steady set hours so she can plan around them. This is a big win for her being able to plan school around work and making more money. On top of that you get a good trustworthy employee. Also sorry, NTA!!"]}
