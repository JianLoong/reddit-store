I\u2019ve slowly realized my brother has adopted our mother\u2019s bad habits.\n\nI can\u2019t list every little problem, but here\u2019s what having him live with us is like.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t financially contribute to the household. He can\u2019t hold a job so he never has money. He will start a new job, train, work for a week, quit, remain jobless for a month or so, rinse and repeat. He doesn\u2019t contribute to the bills or maintenance. He doesn\u2019t buy cleaning supplies or toiletries.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t physically contribute to the household. He doesn\u2019t clean and is a slob. My partner is away for work. I just cleaned the whole house. I work and attend college and take care of the house, like many. Anyway, I went downstairs to grab a drink and saw he made a mess. He made four packs of ramen, left the wrappers all over the kitchen as well as seasoning and crumbs everywhere. The noodles he didn\u2019t eat were in the sink. Here\u2019s the kicker. The sink has a garbage disposal\u2026 he could literally put the noodles into the drain and turn it on but he doesn\u2019t even do that. We have a dishwasher, but he doesn\u2019t even put his dishes in the dishwasher. They\u2019re on the counter.\n\nHe eats all our food. We purchase food that is communal because we aren\u2019t going to let him starve, but we also buy food that\u2019s just for us. I buy fresh-squeezed OJ because it makes my mornings better. One bottle will last me an entire week! Let\u2019s say there are ten servings. I will drink one on Monday, one on Tuesday, then Tuesday night he will drink the rest of the eight servings that are left. Not only that, but he\u2019ll leave the empty bottle in the fridge.\n\nHe\u2019s delusional. Whenever I ask him when he\u2019s going to pay us back, he gets aggressive. He says something like, \u201cwhen you\u2019re done with college and we\u2019re both working full-time, money won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d Mind you, I do work full-time\u2026 My partner and I aren\u2019t even tight on funds but that doesn\u2019t mean we should be supporting him so I don\u2019t understand what he means. He is also regularly aggressive about everything. I knock on his door and ask him to take out the trash, he gets aggressive. I ask him to clean, he gets aggressive. \n\nNot only that, but he is still friends with our high school friend group. I only talk to one person from that group. She told me that my brother told her boyfriend and our old friends in their group chat that he gives us way too much money for us to be asking him to clean up the living room. But he doesn\u2019t give us any money. He owes us a lot of money. He says he doesn\u2019t use the living room so he shouldn\u2019t clean it, but even rooms that aren\u2019t used need to be cleaned from time to time, it\u2019s not rocket science.\n\nWe\u2019ve done a lot for him. Helped him get his license, gave him $1K for his car, took him in, took him on vacation, etc. I feel like he\u2019s taking advantage.

Left a mess behind? Hostility toward reasonable requests? Evict him.", "NTA. My brother is currently living with us. He cleans, he buys groceries, he keeps the bathroom he shares with my kids clean, and he plays with them. He also has a full-time job.

Not to mention, let\u2019s be honest here. He doesn\u2019t want to keep a job long term because he keeps quitting any job he\u2019s hired at.\n\n3. **He doesn\u2019t physically contribute to the household.** He refuses to clean, and he\u2019s lazy and is unsanitary. You clean his messes up after him because he knows you\u2019ll do it so he leaves them there.\n\n4. **He eats all your food** that *you* pay for and doesn\u2019t bat an eye when you notice it\u2019s gone and have to buy more. That\u2019s money down the drain that you could have saved if it weren\u2019t for him mooching off your money.\n\n5. In a roundabout way, **he tells you that he\u2019s not planning to pay you back because he has no money and isn\u2019t working.** He also has an anger problem because he doesn\u2019t want to live a finger to do anything. He thinks you owe him something.\n\n6. **He\u2019s lying to all of your friends to make you out to be the bad guy.** He is smearing your name because you\u2019re telling him things he doesn\u2019t want to hear, so what does he try to do to spite you? He tries to damage your reputation.\n\n**Mark my words:** You owe him *nothing.* You are fed up now, and it has been a long time coming.\n\nIt\u2019s time to tell your brother, \u201c*You have 30 days to find a job and your own place to live because you are no longer welcome here. We are officially kicking you out.*\u201d\n\nNTA.", "Nta. Give him 30 days notice if required where you live. Look at the facts, he's lying about paying to live there to people (to make himself look better than he really is), he's not contributing, he's making your home environment untenable, and he's aggressive. He's mooching plain and simple. Time for him to get his big boy pants on.", "I wouldn't even be giving him the option to change. He would get a move out date and that's it. I don't even want to think about what I'd do if he was still around after the move-out date.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nKick him out, he's being extremely disrespectful and is taking advantage of your kindness.", "NTA, he has taken advantage of you long enough. He needs to move out and pay his own way. Maybe he can cough surf with those friends he's been complaining to.", "NTA - you\u2019re actually enabling him right now because there\u2019s no consequences for his actions. If I quit or lost my job I\u2019d be sweating bricks and about to find myself in a whole heap of trouble. This guy: nothing. Give notice and stick to your word. Good luck.", "NTA, he\u2019s living off of you guys.", "NTA,: Give him yhe boot, no aggressive behavior or lying,  lazy slobs in your home.", "NTA\n\nKick him out, he's taking advantage if you and lying to others about the situation. Since he claims that he has some much money, he can find a place for himself.", "NTA but also I would take caution when throwing your brother out. He sounds bitter, angry and entitled and might not take to being kicked out very well. Would not be surprised if he retaliated by stealing property or damaging it on his way out.", "NTA - what u want to do is called tough love - he needs a large dose - good luck", "The easiest NTA I've ever given.\n\nFamily is family, but not only would taking him in be above and beyond already, you've given him numerous chances and asked him multiple times to change his behavior.\n\nThe blatant lying, leaving an empty OJ container in the fridge, leaving messes around for others to clean up, all while paying no rent, and **on top of that** being aggressive when asked to change? He's trying to take advantage of you and live a life where he doesn't have to do anything.\n\nTo sidestep a little bit, a slobbish upbringing is really hard for most people to break out of. It's amazing that you have broken out of it, but the longer you're stuck in it, the harder it is to break out of it. So an aggressive reaction, while it's childish and ungreatful, is pretty textbook for this sort of situation.\n\nSo while I again would say that you would be NTA for kicking him out, I would recommend giving him an ultimatum first, *if* you want to be that generous. Say that, okay, to live here, at the **absolute bare minimum** he has to clean up after himself, help out with some of the chores around the house, respect what you say is yours and that he can't have, and otherwise not be a disturbance to the household. That would be **extremely generous** to let him live there while only providing that. From there, you take steps to getting him on stable ground with a decent job, and I would recommend that (if you can afford it) instead of asking him for rent money, just let him save up a bit and help him move out to live on his own.
