OP, you have the right mindset about your height.  And your parents genetics are why you are you, including your height.", "NTA. FYI 5\u201910 is a perfectly fine height and above average, and your mom needs to stop making these unfounded comments that chip away at your confidence.", "You definitely aren\u2019t, for one main reason. You didn\u2019t broach the subject. Your mom is the one who initiates the topic. Furthermore, she is deliberately pointing out what she perceives as a flaw in you, which you have no control over (not to mention you\u2019re actually a bit above average in height). Finally, what makes it additionally offensive is that it\u2019s also a major put-down of your dad and makes you wonder how she talks to him or makes him feel.\n\nI would simply ask her straight up why she feels the need to say this. Ask why she would point out something about you that you can\u2019t change and that isn\u2019t a flaw, since you aren\u2019t extremely short. You definitely have every right to be annoyed with this", "NTA. If your mom says it\u2019s sad you\u2019re not taller then she opened herself right up for that. \n\nAlso it\u2019s pretty sensitive of her. I got lost one day and called my mom to tell her that my terrible sense of direction was all her fault, and she just said \u201cokay, yeah, you got that from me\u201d.", "Obviously NTA. Wtf to your mom for criticizing your body, especially something you literally have zero control over. Also, you aren't short, and you are quite tall compared to your parents. And you are 100% right to say it is on her and your dad for your height, as that is factually correct. And you didn't just bring it up yourself, you were just responding to her criticism with facts. I would be tempted to respond by saying that unlike her or your dad, you're able to reach happiness.", "NTA mom shouldn\u2019t dish it out if she can\u2019t take it. What she said to you is awful. Glad you\u2019re the bigger person.", "NTA, your mom is failing you by trying to make you feel insecure about something you shouldn't be.", "NTA- Your mother pointing out how you aren\u2019t tall is rude. Being upset when you pointing out her genetics cause height is just a logical conclusion.", "NTA. You're perfect just the way you are. \n\nYou're right though, it's their fault.", "NTA. But I think your mom is just not realizing  how her comments actually sound and that they are making you feel bad. Probably her intention is to say how great you are, only \"just this one thing short of perfection\". Blaming anyone is weird. You are not responsible for it, but neither is she or your dad. Just nature.", "I thought you were the one being a baby about your height but your mum is ?! What. Thats so weird", "NTA you are the average height of an American man. Not to mention less than 10 percent of the population is actually over 6 feet tall. \n\nTell your mother to stop talking about your height or you will constantly remind her that it is HER GENETICS so any \"fault\" in appearance is 100 percent her fault. \n\nNot to mention your father, her husband, must feel like shit every time she says this.", "NAH. Its not about blame - just science. Height is determined by gene variants. But that isn't absolute. Environmental factors influence us as well. I remember hearing of this formula to calculate potential height from my school days.\n\nThe most common way to determine is by adding both parents' heights (inches), then either add 5in (males) or subtract 5in (females), and then divide in half.\n\nBut nutrition and access to healthy foods during childhood and adolescence play a part too. Congenital anomalies have to be considered as well.\n\nMy father was very tall. My mother is much shorter than average. And I am short just like she is.", "NAH. It has nothing to do with blame, this is how genetics works.  \n\n\nI don't understand what your mother's issues are with your height to be honest. It could be that she used to be teased/ bullied or that she has a certain view on beauty. That's OK but she's basically saying you are not perfect because you lack a couple of inches.  \nI'm 1.55m, My mother is 1.65m, dad is 1.74 and my dear brother is 1.86. So you see I got the short stick ( literally) on my height.\n\nDid my parents care? Yes, they saw I wasn't hitting milestones and were worried for my health. After a lot of tests they predicted I would end up around 1.53/ 1.55. After that, they didn't care about my heigt.", "I was going to say YTA for not practicing gratitude, til I read what your mother is saying, what an odd thing to say to your son.\n\nI'm guessing she's 5'3\"? Pretty funny she thinks you would be perfect if you were 6'+, when the man she chose as her perfect life partner is 3 inches shorter than you.\n\nWhat does your old man say? Does he make comments on what would make you the \"perfect man\"? If not, CUT YOUR MOTHER OFF COLD TURKEY AND NEVER SPEAK TO HER AGAIN!!!! \nJust playing, but I really wouldn't let it get to you, it sounds like some projection she's having about being short.\n\nFunny story, I dated this girl last year who made a similar comment about wanting me to be taller. She was 5' 1\". I'm 6' even... i know there's dudes way taller than I am, but I just don't give a hobo's hat about height, case and point I dated bilbo naggins last year.\n\nI think she was just a little out there, she also believed the earth was flat. About the beginning of the end, that was. Beautiful girl though, long black hair and big brown eyes.  Always walking barefoot around the shire with her big ass hairy feet, smoking longbottom leaf and being like a hundred and still cute...\n\nOh yeah your mom, don't worry about that. You should start wearing platform boots around the house, see if she thinks thats a good compromise.", "Start eating a lot of meat. Preferably beef. You are only 17, you have a chance to grow a bit still.
