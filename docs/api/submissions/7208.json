But a few days ago I was spending the day with my daughter and she kept complaining about issues with her car (which is a pos) and she asked me if she could borrow \u00a31000 to buy another one and I told her no and that instead she should just take my car since my new one is due to arrive in two weeks and in the meantime I'll just rent one. \n\nWhen I told my girlfriend about it afterwards I knew she'd be mad but I offered to just buy her a different car but she screamed at me and called me selfish and said that I should at least once choose her over my daughter. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673606637, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10arhs3/aita_for_giving_my_daughter_a_car_that_i/", "score": 387, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Are you going to have her make payments for whatever car you buy her instead? And is it a regular conflict between you and the girlfriend about you choosing your daughter over her?", "YTA- for going back on your word & not even discussing it with her first. You had an agreement for her to buy the car, so it wasn\u2019t really yours to now give away.", "ESH\n\nYou should have talked with your girlfriend at least before making the change.  It's amazing how much difference being consulted respectfully about a decision like this can make in a reaction. **You could still put your daughters need in the forefront while making your woman feel heard and letting her be part of the solution.** You did promise her the car and I don't understand why, if you are in a position to just buy the girlfriend a car, you didn't lend/ give your daughter the money to solve her car situation in the first place. \n\nHowever, while the girlfriends upset is understandable. The expectation that she will ever come before your daughter is a bit much. I am going to guess she was just upset, feeling slighted, and lost her temper, but that wasn't a great reaction.", "YTA. I agree with others here that you're daughter comes first, to an extent.\n\nYour daughter is an adult and should be working towards a new car or repairs, ect ect. However your actions as a parent is what any one of us would do for our kids.\n\nThe reason why I say YTA, you already made a promise to another for that vehicle. You should have at least had a conversation with your girlfriend first before changing your mind on the vehicle situation. She could have been in the same situation and made plans off your initial actions. This shows a decent level of disrespect and disregard for the other person involved irregardless of whom they are to you.\n\nI will say kudos though for being able to afford a new car, give away the old one, and offer the girlfriend a new one to lol", "YTA - you don't make a promise and then get to do as you want. The right thing would have been to talk about it with your gf FIRST and then respect her choice if she still wanted the car you promised her. You can buy a new one to your daughter.", "YTA For making a mess out of something that didn't need fo be a mess. \n\n1. The gf asked for your car, not money. You agreed. \n\n2. Your daughter asked for money, not your car. \n\nYour solution: You denied both the thing they wanted, switched it up and offered the thing they didn't want. \n\nNot to mention you went back on your word for no apparent reason. Nowhere does it say your daughter needed your car immediately or she wouldn't have asked for money. Buying a new car with the money she asked for or getting hers repaired would take time. \n\nWhat's the point in all this? You could've given your daughter the money she asked for and given your gf the car like you'd agreed. Everyone would've been happy.", "You made a promise and then you backed out on it. It seems like you didn't even relay the change very gracefully, by just telling her and then offering to buy her out when she got mad. You objectively botched this when there were more proactive options available. You knew your daughter's car was a pos, so if it's that serious she should have been your first stop, if this was really about \"family first\". Instead it seems like you're making quick decisions that make you feel good, not thinking about the real impact it has or anything more than what is right in front of you.\n\nSo, by the context given here, objectively yes... YTA.", "So does that mean your girlfriend will have to pay more for a new car after you told her she could pay for your old one?\n\nIf you're just offering her a car, then you're being extremely nice. If you just fucked her over after agreeing to a deal, yeah, you're an asshole.", "I'm going with YTA.\n\nYour daughter asked for money, just give her the money dude. Your girlfriend asked for the car because I'm guessing she either doesn't have one or hers is broke down and she wants a newer one. She would be paying you too. Your daughter just wanted the money and didn't ask for the car, who knows maybe she had her eye on a car that was that price she originally wanted anyway.\n\nYou promised your girlfriend the car and then gave it to your daughter. Does she have a job that she needs it RIGHT NOW? I would condone putting your kid first but if her car still runs why can't you just give it to your girlfriend? Somethings not adding up to your girlfriend being this upset about a car.", "1.  You promised your car to your girlfriend.\n2.  You broke your promise.\n\nYou dealt with the whole situation really badly.  Your daughter seems to be a responsible young woman who asked you for a loan - instead you leapt to solve the situation for her.  Without talking to your partner.  It may be that your partner is unreasonable and demands to be FIRST, FIRST, FIRST all the time, but it sounds as though she has genuine reason to be upset here.  Of course you prioritise your children when they are minors and in your care, but your daughter is grown up now.  Your partner also deserves to be on your priority list.\n\nYou could have scored so many points with both these important women in your life if you had treated them as important, thinking adults.  You failed to do so.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYou make a promise, you stick with it or at least your discuss it first. Your gf might have had a million practical or sentimental reasons for wanting that specific car.\n\nIf we were talking about inheritance issues or about helping your grown kids financially and your gf objected to that, I'd say there's a serious red flag there, but on more mundane stuff an adult child should not automatically take precedence over the person who shares your life and definitely not if there is already a prior agreement.\n\nIf your daughter was in a relationship with someone who already has kids, I'm sure you wouldn't want her to feel like she's always playing second fiddle. Don't do it to your gf either. I'm not saying children should be shoved to the side, but there's a balance to be found there.", "YTA, you had a deal with your girlfriend. The least you could have done is tell your daughter you have to talk to her first. How is she supposed to ever trust you if you throw your agreements away like this", "YTA for breaking promises to your girlfriend to appease your daughter AGAIN (it\u2019s clearly not the first time), even though the situation could be rectified WITHOUT having to break said promise - you just lack the critical thinking skills it takes and/or you\u2019re lazy. I\u2019ve met Dad\u2019s like you - bends at every will and whim of their child out of guilt to appease their children, using the \u201cBUT MY KIDS COME FIRST\u201d line to veto decisions you made with your spouse. Obviously every sane person knows that kids safety and health comes first. But if that isn\u2019t in jeopardy which you haven\u2019t indicated why break the promise? Was this a safety issue with your daughter\u2019s car? That\u2019s the only way I can see you being abdicated from the YTA judgment. Even if it was it doesn\u2019t seem like you communicated this with your gf. Idk why any self respecting woman would stay in a situation like this where she plays second fiddle to your (adult) daughter, like stay single then lol.", "Oh normally I'd go NTA for putting your daughter first, but I am going YTA because you had already told your girlfriend she could have car. You should never have changed your mind without asking your girlfriend if she would be ok with it. She still probably would have been pissed, but at least she would have been part of the conversation instead of completely disregarded and no concern given to how she would feel about it, even though you admit to knowing she would be mad", "YTA. You agreed to give the car to your partner and she\u2019s pay it off. I get things can change, but it doesn\u2019t sound like you even discussed this with her before telling your daughter she could have it", "YTA ... You made agreement with your gf and then you changed it without discussing it with her.", "YTA\n\nYou broke your promise. It means she can't trust you", "ESH except your daughter. You are an AH for making a promise and breaking your word. Your GF is an AH for keeping a scorecard to feed her resentment and compete with your daughter. What kind of woman competes with a child for affection?  Of course, if she can\u2019t count on your word then you feed her insecurities. You two need to seriously evaluate your relationship.", "YTA for \u201cshe said that I should at least once choose her over my daughter.\u201d I\u2019m guessing this isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve chosen to screw over your gf for your kid. Your daughter didn\u2019t even ask for your car (that you\u2019d said you\u2019d sell to your gf). She asked you for money. Why not just give her the money?? Doesn\u2019t it cost at least that much to rent a car for a couple weeks? Plus now you\u2019ve screwed over your gf and she\u2019s gonna have to go out and find herself a car instead of having it be easy on her. Also \u201cI knew she\u2019d be mad,\u201d and you\u2019re just\u2026okay with that? You\u2019re okay with doing crappy things knowing it\u2019s gonna make her mad? \n\nYou should break up with your adult gf. Let her find a man who loves her and stop wasting her time. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. \n\nBecause this is not about the car. \n\nIt\u2019s about disrespect for your girlfriend. \n\nINFO - Do you often agree something with her (what your plans are for the weekend, what you\u2019re eating for dinner, regular stuff) - and then your daughter mentions something & you just arbitrarily change your *plans that include your girlfriend, without first discussing them with your girlfriend*\u2026? \n\nIf so, this is incredibly rude & disrespectful. \n\nOf course a child should be a priority to a parent for the important stuff - but a 19 year old non-resident child is not so needy that every minor thing they mention in passing should result in you screwing over other people. Especially your long term girlfriend. \n\nI\u2019m getting the impression that you might be so desperate for love / approval from your daughter that you act in very irrational ways that are cruel to your girlfriend. Repeatedly. \n\nWould your girlfriend agree with this description of your behaviour?", "\"I offered to just buy her a different car\"\n\n\n... you could've done that for your daughter too. \n\n\n\nWith this in mind it is not even choosing one person over the other.\n\n\n\nYTA in my personal opinion. \n\n\n\nIf you meant the offer to buy another car, you just randomly created a line of problems. You needing to rent a car. Breaking the promise to your gf. \n\n\nIf you didn't mean the offer to buy a car, you just made another empty promise to shut her up.", "YTA only because you didn\u2019t talk to your gf about it first.

If you told your gf that your daughter needs a car and you want to give her this one, you\u2019ll figure out another solution for her car then it would be up front and clear.", "YTA because you already had promised the car to her, so it was shitty of you to take that back without even discussing it with her first, BUT what your girlfriend said is a bit out of place, your daugther is your child and she will allways comes first for you, or atleast that's how should be, and her saying that is telling me that she sees your daugther as a rival, that's not ok and it won't work long term.", "YTA. Your daughter should in fact come first and not your girlfriend, but you already made a deal with your girlfriend.", "YTA\n\nYou made a promise to your Girlfriend - not just some loose offer or vague statement. This even involved her offering you instalments to pay for it.\n\nYour Girlfriend does not have a car, your Daughter does. Yes it has issues, but it apparently works. If you can afford to rent and even buy your Girlfriend another car, why didn't you just _give your daughter the money?_.\n\nThis is a mess you could've easily avoided - you could've even offered to pay your daughter to rent a car for a while until she can either afford it herself or get it fixed etc.\n\nThere's literally a variety of options you could've chosen that meant you didn't renege on your agreement with your girlfriend. Where's her Mother in all this? Can you not go 50/50 on helping her out? Can her Mother not give her lifts or help?

Why is she trying to compete with your child?", "He's still offering her a car. It wasn't great that he went back on the original deal, but a car was still going to be provided.\n\nHer response was to demand that he pick her over his child.

But instead of asking that he buy his daughter a different car and honour their agreement, she issued an ultimatum.", "ESH but the kid\n\nUnpopular maybe but here's why. \n\nYou promised something to your girlfriend and then instantly the next day changed your mind on it.. If you have such little issue buying a different car for your girlfriend, you could've taken your daughter out to find a different car.. You didn't have to give your old one to your kid. \n\nHowever.. Your girlfriend saying that you need to think of her BEFORE your child is ridiculous??

The real issue here is that his GF feels like she should be put above his child. I don\u2019t care what the situation is, your child should always come first. Relationships come and go, but your family is forever. \n\nYes, he agreed to giving her the car beforehand, but it is his property and he can do with it what he wants and his kid who is most likely in college needed a reliable car to get from A to B. He offered up a solution for the GF and it still wasn\u2019t good enough for her.\n\nGF is an entitled asshole, that\u2019s why the solution wasn\u2019t good enough. And stop assuming that you know anything about the relationship between OP and his child.", "Most people aren't going to have an extra car on hand that they're willing to part with - especially right now - and in turn most wouldn't assume to ask about it. OP's daughter has clearly been having car issues for a while and the only obvious solution in mind would be to buy a different car, so thats what she asked for help with.\n\nSeeing as she lives with her mother, its very possible they never really discussed that he was getting a new car, as that's a detail a lot of people I know don't find important enough to share compared to other topics. Even if it was brought up, it could have just not crossed her mind to ask as she was already working towards a common and logical solution herself. \n\nEither way, if she has been having consistent car problems, it would be absolute best case scenario for her to be able to replace it immediately to avoid her getting into an unfortunate situation; that just wasn't expected to be a realistic outcome in these kinds of situations usually. Her father had the ability to help her more efficiently, doing his parental duty of protecting and providing for his child. Hes a good dad for that.", "Where does it say the car would be brand new?\n\nThe condition of a car you can buy for under 1k isn't worth having.", "That the GF is then responsible for paying for since OP has said the payment terms would stay the same. It\u2019s only \u201cbuying her a car\u201d if she doesn\u2019t have to actually pay for it.", "Not really, he made a promise and should have discussed the change in circumstances regarding the promise with her. Its not about the new car or the old car, its the fact that according to GF he always prioritises the daughter over her and the fact that she didn't even consult him about it.\n\nIf you are going to promise something then situation changes and you decide to not tell the involved party then YTA no matter what.\n\nOP should have discussed it with her and then moved from that talk. Ideally he should have bought the daughter a new car and gave the gf the old car which is a much better scenario and even favours the daughter more.", "> If I get her a new car it would be on the same terms as if she had gotten my old one.\n\nIt\u2019s not really buying her a new car if OP is effectively just acting as the intermediary in the situation - the GF is still the one ultimately _paying_ for it.", "Lmao how can anyone call OP an asshole? He's buying her a brand new car for FREE, she was going to BUY his old one NTA", "I don't know that the girlfriend expressed her upset appropriately, but putting the daughter first doesn't mean completely side lining your SO. If he's got the resources to offer to buy the girlfriend a new car, then he had the flexibility to do several solutions here. He could have discussed it with his girlfriend first, considering the promise he made her. She may have been a lot more on board if consulted, and he could have prioritized his daughters need while still respecting his girlfriend.", "I'm not sure it was first, the way OP posted it, it sounded as though he told his gf and then offered based on her reaction.", "Gf is not the AH, and being a stepmom to a 19 yr old that does not live with you is hardly being a stepmom. Also, this has nothing to do with choosing one over the other. They had an agreement. Why not buy the daughter a new car? Also, I\u2019m assuming since she was going to pay for the old one in installments, she may not be able to make the payments for the new car.", "Was he buying gf a new or used car?  She might have wanted  his because she knows  if it's had accidents and how well it's been maintained. \nHe could have talked to her first since he promised  her first", "I agree with this. Buying a partner a car can create a shift of the power dynamic in the relationship. Buying your kid a car would be almost standard", "No , she told him out of anger what her anger really was. Choosing his daughter over her.", "Maybe he's not comfortable expecting his daughter to fork up large sums for the insurance on a newer car either? It would cost a lot more for daughter to have a newer car, insurance wise, than it is for the gf to have a newer car.", "Prioritising your kid is not an excuse for being an unreliable partner. OP's GF should have formulated her response better, but the gist of it is that she feels like a second rank citizen in her relationship with OP. OP needs to keep his promises to her. And if he has a good reason to go back on that promise, he should discuss that with his GF **before** doing anything.", "They are in a 3 year commitment and live together. I didn't say she should get to make the decision, but given that they made an agreement for her to purchase this car, a conversation about it would have been respectful. If he hadn't already promised the car to his girlfriend, he'd have every right to make unilateral decisions without consulting her.\n\nYou are really intending to say that your significant other gets zero consideration until you marry them? That's...odd.", "People here are saying that it's a massive red flag for the girlfriend to say he should have at least once choose her. We don't know how often OP pulled actions like this. And the way he describes this and has to ask on Reddit if he is an asshole for breaking a promise as an adult... (I think every twelve year old knows you don't break promises, come on). \n\nI think it happens more than we know and I would be mad too. So I would maybe use the \"for once\" also in the heat of the moment in her position. \nIt says a lot more about him than it does about the girlfriend.", "**called me selfish and said that I should at least once choose her over my daughter.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo be fair she never said that ( atleast on the original post). It seems to me that the OP is constantly letting his gf down and breaking promises / plans on the back of later conversations with his daughter.", "I mean, yeah but it's still not... that convoluted?\n\nI'm sorry. Hands down the daughter is and should always be more important than someone he started dating 3 years ago. Especially considering she's a young adult barely and she would have been 15/16 when he started dating his new person (which is even more weird with the more important comment, why would you ever want to be more important than a dependent). It's not a competition here. The daughter actively was having car issues, versus the girlfriend who for whatever reason doesn't have her own car? (he weirdly doesn't specify with her unless he did in a comment then I'm sorry I didn't comment surf really) it's not exactly an asshole move to prioritize your child who still actually needs you. She's an adult now by law but she was a minor 1-2 years ago, she hasn't had her foot out long enough. \n\nEveryone should know it's wrong to take back a promise, but again it's not even that simple here. I could see if he was like \"well my daughter is more special than you, I don't care\" but he didn't, and even offered to get *another* car for her (whether it be new or used) and she still threw a fit. She wouldn't have even got that car until his new one arrived, so it makes less sense as to her reaction.\n\nFor all I'm getting from this post, we see a father who clearly thought his daughter was in more need than his girlfriend, who he thought would have benefitted from more of a choice. It's not to say taking back a promise is right  but it's not like he told her to go figure it out on her own.\n\nThis is one of those posts that I feel leaves out alot of detail and it feels weird like it's either manipulating the truth or just made up because of how simple the answer appears to be.", "You're completely right and this is something that came to mind like... 10 minutes after I wrote this, lol. I read some other comments and kind of did a 180 on a part of my opinion because the guy just sounds like he takes issues at surface level, which isn't always a bad thing but sometimes people want you to actually care.", "Her reaction still sucks. Being upset is understandable and OP is about to lose a relationship over being an idiot, but if she really screamed at him after he already offered to by her a new car that\u2019s a pretty asshole move.", "How is offering to buy her a new car sidelining?He wasn\u2019t like \u201clol oh well\u201d. Gf is an adult who threw a tantrum.", ">If he's got the resources to offer to buy the girlfriend a new car\n\nHe doesn't, she'll also be paying as well. She probably doesn't have the ability to pay it in a lump some so instalments on second hand car might have been the best choice for her.\n\nYes, OP should have consulted the GF. The anger probably isn't so much the care but the absolute disregard he has for the promises he makes to her. Offering to help her buy a new car is more of damage control.", "Because it stopped being about the car after the gf made it about picking sides, OP offered a more than reasonable offer to buy the gf a NEW car but she didnt want it because she was busy having a tantrum that he offered the car to his daughter who clearly needed it", "Bc 19 year Olds are notoriously bad drivers. Also, insurance. Yikes.", "why gf wants to be more important than daughter? why can't she accept that he couldn't fulfill the promise because something more important come? but he STILL make sure he would be just with her: he offered to BUY her car. She wouldn't have to pay anything AT ALL", "She is TA for telling OP to pick her over the daughter. That\u2019s disgusting behavior.", "Because in the UK a 19 year old would have to pay a HUGE amount of money for insurance on a newer car. The gf wouldn't. Therefore it makes sense to buy her a newer car and let the daughter have the older car. I mean how ungrateful can one person be, pitching a fit, even though he's buying her a new car?", "Hard disagree.  The minute anyone says they should be more important to you than your own child they immediately become the AH.  I don\u2019t care if said child is 9, 19, 29, 39 or older, your children come before anyone.", "Sometimes, shit happens that mean you can\u2019t stick to your agreements.

Her response makes no sense.", ">Why not buy the daughter a new car?\n\nInsurance", "But she was also going to be PAYING for the car.", "Definitely agree about taking to her first. She may even have agreed or been receptive but is just frustrated that he went back on that promise without even a discussion first.", "In the UK a lot of car companies won't allow a person under 21 drive a car they've financed and insurance would be significantly more expensive. But buying one for his gf wouldn't have the same issues attached and insurance would be more affordable.", "It's a shit comment to make. It's not lost on me that he changed his mind without even discussing it first. How often does that sort of thing happen? She's definitely right to feel slighted about this situation in particular. To analyze that comment I think more info is needed about the dynamic between the three.", "I don't disagree. Idk who puts the gf in competition with the daughter, but there shouldn't be one.", "I mean I might be controversial on this but I feel like daughter absolutely should be chosen first over a gf every time, the issue OP had with this was that daughter didn't need to be in competition for the car, she wanted money to help buy one and OP tore the rug out from under gf to offer his old one. I get that he felt like he had something to give and wanted to give it, I don't think that makes OP a bad person, but he should have put some thought into it not really being his after he promised it to somebody already", "Perhaps OP edited their post, but it's there now.", "My main contention is the fact that daughter asked for help buying herself a car and presumably already had money put away and needed a bump to get it from her dad,  completely reasonable. The issue is he knew he already told gf she's getting it, but just threw it out on a whim to give to his daughter when it wasn't even what she was asking for. He created an issue that shouldn't have been there to start with, give gf your car and daughter her 1k to buy her own, but he threw a wrench in that by double promising the car", "She didn't ask him to purchase her a car, and there are a multitude of reasons she may not be comfortable with that solution. She did make an agreement with him to purchase his car. Surely, a simple conversation before he gives away something he promised to sell her is just basic courtesy.", "Depends on what the availability of new cars is (currently not good in many places). OP had to wait a few months for his. So gf had been told she can have OP\u2019s old car in a couple of weeks, but instead has to start waiting again until a new car can arrive.", "She would still have to pay for the new car and presumably more in insurance. This wasn\u2019t an emergency situation that prevented him from discussing with his GF first. That\u2019s wrong and not how you manage a relationship. You discuss things first without making a unilateral decision.", "That\u2019s why you gave a conversation with your GF first and determine the best outcome.", "She would still have to pay for the car per his other comments. Why couldn\u2019t he talk to get before making that decision? This wasn\u2019t an emergency situation where he needed to make a quick decision. He had time to discuss it with his gf and make a determination. Yes your children are a priority, but if you always put your adult children ahead of your partner with no regard for their feelings, you shouldn\u2019t be dating.", "You don\u2019t make unilateral decisions like this when you are in a relationship. This wasn\u2019t an emergency situation where he had to make a snap judgement. The fact that he didn\u2019t even think to discuss with GF is very telling with regard to how he views her.

It\u2019s not about the car it\u2019s about the lack of regard for his GF.", "No, the appropriate thing would have been to have a discussion with GF first. Insurance on the new car is going to be higher, maybe GF can\u2019t afford that or presumably she would buy her own car.

And also, if it's on payments, some auto companies don't even allow under 21s to drive a car with a loan attached to it in the UK.\n\nEdit: Location so people know we're talking the UK here.", "I feel like it\u2019s one of those things where they both assume things a lot .\nHim assuming she\u2019d be okay with him just giving his daughter the older car to get his gf a new one- benefit of the doubt he\u2019s oblivious always trying to make one of the 2 happy. It doesn\u2019t seem like the daughter lives with op , probably why he maybe feels a little more obligated to help his daughter. \nHer assumption because they\u2019ve been in a long term relationship that she now has precedence over his daughter, especially now that she\u2019s an adult. Bottom line that\u2019s still his daughter and maybe he should make it more clear on where he stands on that dynamic before moving forward with his relationship. \nSeems like nobody can win here unless they communicate better with their feelings", "Oh no no I absolutely agree with you there. Again it's not fair to do that to people.\n\nActually I read another comment and I realized something else, and I'm kinda going back on a point I made previously. I don't understand that if he eventually was going to offer her a new car/take her car shopping, why he would string her along to begin with. He's got this, assuming, older car. He then has a new car about to be within his grasp. We can only assume he may also be the reason his daughter had the car she did have in the first place. He then, after getting into it with his girlfriend, offers yet assets. It doesn't sound like he's all that strapped for money and just in general doesn't see priority because he can afford it (does this make sense?). Because if his girlfriend could just get her own car in a faster manner I doubt she would be waiting to middle man it out with him, instead of trying to get something on credit. Which, is YTA because if you were just going to toss assets at people what was the issue to begin with.", "It\u2019s not sidelining. Sidelining would mean he left her high and dry. He did not.", "So it\u2019s okay to screw his GF over. He\u2019s gonna it her new car, and her insurance is gonna go up, along with her car payment. He made an agreement and he should\u2019ve stuck to it", "I actually just noticed that the OP clarified he's not actually offered to buy her a new car, just to help her get one on similar terms to what he offered her. So, she'd be making the payments. Yeah. She should have been involved in these decisions earlier."]}
