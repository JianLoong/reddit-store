Are you going to have her make payments for whatever car you buy her instead? And is it a regular conflict between you and the girlfriend about you choosing your daughter over her?", "YTA- for going back on your word & not even discussing it with her first. You had an agreement for her to buy the car, so it wasn\u2019t really yours to now give away.", "ESH\n\nYou should have talked with your girlfriend at least before making the change.  It's amazing how much difference being consulted respectfully about a decision like this can make in a reaction. **You could still put your daughters need in the forefront while making your girlfriend feel heard and letting her be part of the solution.** You did promise her the car and I don't understand why, if you are in a position to just buy the girlfriend a car, you didn't lend/ give your daughter the money to solve her car situation in the first place. \n\nHowever, while the girlfriends upset is understandable. The expectation that she will come before your daughter is a bit much. I am going to guess she was just upset, feeling slighted, and lost her temper, but that wasn't a great reaction.", "YTA. I agree with others here that you're daughter comes first, to an extent.\n\nYour daughter is an adult and should be working towards a new car or repairs, ect ect. However your actions as a parent is what any one of us would do for our kids.\n\nThe reason why I say YTA, you already made a promise to another for that vehicle. You should have at least had a conversation with your girlfriend first before changing your mind on the vehicle situation. She could have been in the same situation and made plans off your initial actions. This shows a decent level of disrespect and disregard for the other person involved irregardless of whom they are to you.\n\nI will say kudos though for being able to afford a new car, give away the old one, and offer the girlfriend a new one to lol", "YTA - you don't make a promise and then get to do as you want. The right thing would have been to talk about it with your gf FIRST and then respect her choice if she still wanted the car you promised her. You can buy a new one to your daughter.", "YTA For making a mess out of something that didn't need fo be a mess. \n\n1. The gf asked for your car, not money. You agreed. \n\n2. Your daughter asked for money, not your car. \n\nYour solution: You denied both the thing they wanted, switched it up and offered the thing they didn't want. \n\nNot to mention you went back on your word for no apparent reason. Nowhere does it say your daughter needed your car immediately or she wouldn't have asked for money. Buying a new car with the money she asked for or getting hers repaired would take time. \n\nWhat's the point in all this? You could've given your daughter the money she asked for and given your gf the car like you'd agreed. Everyone would've been happy.", "You made a promise and then you backed out on it. It seems like you didn't even relay the change very gracefully, by just telling her and then offering to buy her out when she got mad. You objectively botched this when there were more proactive options available. You knew your daughter's car was a pos, so if it's that serious she should have been your first stop, if this was really about \"family first\". Instead it seems like you're making quick decisions that make you feel good, not thinking about the real impact it has or anything more than what is right in front of you.\n\nSo, by the context given here, objectively yes... YTA.", "So does that mean your girlfriend will have to pay more for a new car after you told her she could pay for your old one?\n\nIf you're just offering her a car, then you're being extremely nice. If you just fucked her over after agreeing to a deal, yeah, you're an asshole.", "I'm going with YTA.\n\nYour daughter asked for money, just give her the money dude. Your girlfriend asked for the car because I'm guessing she either doesn't have one or hers is broke down and she wants a newer one. She would be paying you too. Your daughter just wanted the money and didn't ask for the car, who knows maybe she had her eye on a car that was that price she originally wanted anyway.\n\nYou promised your girlfriend the car and then gave it to your daughter. Does she have a job that she needs it RIGHT NOW? I would condone putting your kid first but if her car still runs why can't you just give it to your girlfriend? Somethings not adding up to your girlfriend being this upset about a car.", "1.  You promised your car to your girlfriend.\n2.  You broke your promise.\n\nYou dealt with the whole situation really badly.  Your daughter seems to be a responsible young woman who asked you for a loan - instead you leapt to solve the situation for her.  Without talking to your partner.  It may be that your partner is unreasonable and demands to be FIRST, FIRST, FIRST all the time, but it sounds as though she has genuine reason to be upset here.  Of course you prioritise your children when they are minors and in your care, but your daughter is grown up now.  Your partner also deserves to be on your priority list.\n\nYou could have scored so many points with both these important women in your life if you had treated them as important, thinking adults.  You failed to do so.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYou make a promise, you stick with it or at least your discuss it first. Your gf might have had a million practical or sentimental reasons for wanting that specific car.\n\nIf we were talking about inheritance issues or about helping your grown kids financially and your gf objected to that, I'd say there's a serious red flag there, but on more mundane stuff an adult child should not automatically take precedence over the person who shares your life and definitely not if there is already a prior agreement.\n\nIf your daughter was in a relationship with someone who already has kids, I'm sure you wouldn't want her to feel like she's always playing second fiddle. Don't do it to your gf either. I'm not saying children should be shoved to the side, but there's a balance to be found there.", "YTA, you had a deal with your girlfriend. The least you could have done is tell your daughter you have to talk to her first. How is she supposed to ever trust you if you throw your agreements away like this", "YTA for breaking promises to your girlfriend to appease your daughter AGAIN (it\u2019s clearly not the first time), even though the situation could be rectified WITHOUT having to break said promise - you just lack the critical thinking skills it takes and/or you\u2019re lazy. I\u2019ve met Dad\u2019s like you - bends at every will and whim of their child out of guilt to appease their children, using the \u201cBUT MY KIDS COME FIRST\u201d line to veto decisions you made with your spouse. Obviously every sane person knows that kids safety and health comes first. But if that isn\u2019t in jeopardy which you haven\u2019t indicated why break the promise? Was this a safety issue with your daughter\u2019s car? That\u2019s the only way I can see you being abdicated from the YTA judgment. Even if it was it doesn\u2019t seem like you communicated this with your gf. Idk why any self respecting woman would stay in a situation like this where she plays second fiddle to your (adult) daughter, like stay single then lol.", "Oh normally I'd go NTA for putting your daughter first, but I am going YTA because you had already told your girlfriend she could have car. You should never have changed your mind without asking your girlfriend if she would be ok with it. She still probably would have been pissed, but at least she would have been part of the conversation instead of completely disregarded and no concern given to how she would feel about it, even though you admit to knowing she would be mad", "YTA. You agreed to give the car to your partner and she\u2019s pay it off. I get things can change, but it doesn\u2019t sound like you even discussed this with her before telling your daughter she could have it", "YTA ... You made agreement with your gf and then you changed it without discussing it with her.", "YTA\n\nYou broke your promise. It means she can't trust you", "ESH except your daughter. You are an AH for making a promise and breaking your word. Your GF is an AH for keeping a scorecard to feed her resentment and compete with your daughter. What kind of woman competes with a child for affection?  Of course, if she can\u2019t count on your word then you feed her insecurities. You two need to seriously evaluate your relationship.", "YTA for \u201cshe said that I should at least once choose her over my daughter.\u201d I\u2019m guessing this isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve chosen to screw over your gf for your kid. Your daughter didn\u2019t even ask for your car (that you\u2019d said you\u2019d sell to your gf). She asked you for money. Why not just give her the money?? Doesn\u2019t it cost at least that much to rent a car for a couple weeks? Plus now you\u2019ve screwed over your gf and she\u2019s gonna have to go out and find herself a car instead of having it be easy on her. Also \u201cI knew she\u2019d be mad,\u201d and you\u2019re just\u2026okay with that? You\u2019re okay with doing crappy things knowing it\u2019s gonna make her mad? \n\nYou should break up with your adult gf. Let her find a man who loves her and stop wasting her time. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. \n\nBecause this is not about the car. \n\nIt\u2019s about disrespect for your girlfriend. \n\nINFO - Do you often agree something with her (what your plans are for the weekend, what you\u2019re eating for dinner, regular stuff) - and then your daughter mentions something & you just arbitrarily change your *plans that include your girlfriend, without first discussing them with your girlfriend*\u2026? \n\nIf so, this is incredibly rude & disrespectful. \n\nOf course a child should be a priority to a parent for the important stuff - but a 19 year old non-resident child is not so needy that every minor thing they mention in passing should result in you screwing over other people. Especially your long term girlfriend. \n\nI\u2019m getting the impression that you might be so desperate for love / approval from your daughter that you act in very irrational ways that are cruel to your girlfriend. Repeatedly. \n\nWould your girlfriend agree with this description of your behaviour?", "\"I offered to just buy her a different car\"\n\n\n... you could've done that for your daughter too. \n\n\n\nWith this in mind it is not even choosing one person over the other.\n\n\n\nYTA in my personal opinion. \n\n\n\nIf you meant the offer to buy another car, you just randomly created a line of problems. You needing to rent a car. Breaking the promise to your gf. \n\n\nIf you didn't mean the offer to buy a car, you just made another empty promise to shut her up.", "YTA only because you didn\u2019t talk to your gf about it first.

I'm sure if she could afford to get a brand new car in her name, she would've done so, but instead she asked if she could have his old car. There's no way he doesn't know her financial situation so if this is true as well, it makes him even more an ass.

Obviously sometimes that is unavoidable, but this isn't even close to one of those times.

At the very least people are completely correct that he could have talked with his girlfriend first.", "They're not getting a NEW new car for \u00a31k", "As a general rule, I believe that kids come first, but it always can have exceptions.. for example, kids that are AH to their parents, sociopaths lol or even those who don\u2019t treat their parents right, don\u2019t talk to them, etc. \n\nFor starters, I always make an exercise of switching genders, to try to have an impartial opinion. In this case, if it was a woman prioritizing her 3y bf over her daughter, how would that make her look? Most people would say that she\u2019s a bad mom and that the daughter should come first.\n\nAs for the age: ok, she\u2019s 19. But it isn\u2019t like \u201coh, she\u2019s an adult now, so I won\u2019t look out for her nor give money or care for her anymore cause she\u2019s her own person\u201d.. that\u2019s bullshit, she\u2019s 19, not 30. You\u2019re not supposed to stop caring about your kids when they reach majority. Things just change. And the daughter here is still very young and probably just started earning her own money, which is probably way less than OPs girlfriend.\n\n\nFor the car: buying a new car doesn\u2019t mean buying a new car of the same value, it can even be a used car. He could buy her an used car or an economic one, safer and more of the likes of a 19yo, easier to drive, with a fair price for insurance etc. his car is probably a very good one\u2026 \n\nThere\u2019s also that old rule: lovers come and go, family is forever. In this case, the daughter is family.. the gf can break up with this guy at any moment (specially if she\u2019s annoyed by him having kids) and when comes down to it and he\u2019s in his 80\u2019s, his daughter will most likely be the one who will look after him.. even if she lives her own life in the meantime.. \n\nIdeally, I believe that a lover and a child occupy different spaces at someone\u2019s heart and this shouldnt be a competition (obviously cause we\u2019re talking about very different types of love). But in real life people tend to compete for attention (and money) and, well, things are not ideal. \n\nSo, in the end, you simply try to put yourself in the other shoes: if you had a boyfriend and a kid, who would you think that need you more? Who would you feel safer to spend money with? Buy gifts for? Are you sure that your lover is for life? Or even that this person doesn\u2019t only wants you for money?

Newer and more expensive cars are more expensive to repair and replace, so higher rates.

Sucked at the time, but now I live in a zip code whewre it's cheaper to insure, and every time I drive back to that area it's pretty obvious why it's more expensive to insure a car there. And then there's totaling, which is really just an insurance term used to describe when a repair bill is around 75-80% of a car's replacement value so insurance won't pay to repair it and won't insure it again if it is repaired.

You are also a person, your partner is also a person, and realistically you are going to be sharing (ideally) most moments of the rest of your life with them.
