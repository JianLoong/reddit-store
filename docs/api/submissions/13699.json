My mom was late getting me that day because she walked that other teacher to the counselor\u2019s office and got the principal called in, too. Basically that teacher had been being abused by her husband for years but had been too ashamed to tell anyone and him kicking her out was because he was tired of hiding his mistress from her and had convinced her he was in the right and the cops would side with him.

It was at -2 when I asked.", "I\u2019ve alerted the authorities. Sammich police is on the way \ud83d\ude0e", "NTA.\n\nYour coworker is lucky they didn't take my food or there would have been hell to pay. For me, my meals are the highlight to my work day. In the morning I look forward to my lunch break and the afternoon is for anticipating dinner.\n\nMy lunch might be homemade lasagne, or thai green curry, or any number of delicious things that I would be upset about losing. I have, in the past, insisted a coworker replace my fettucini alla puttanesca that she ate a bite of \"just to try because it looked so good\" with puttanesca from the closest italian restaurant. She tried to offer me her mac and cheese instead, but that is not puttanesca.\n\nSHE avoided ME afterwards, and I say good riddance to the food thief.", "NTA. You have every right to not interact with a person who stole from you. Your coworkers are idiots.", "Only the coworkers who are bringing in lunch for the thief get to tell someone else to forgive and forget.\n\nThey just want someone else's lunch to be the target so their's is safe.", "How is it poisoning though? Someone is eating YOUR food, you can\u2019t make your food however spicy you want now? \n\nAnd I highly doubt someone is going to keep evidence of the food they ate to bring it up in court and they would have to admit to stealing the food in the first place.\n\nBy law if you put it in the food with the intent to poison someone, yes, it\u2019s illegal. But what leg do you have to stand on when you initially stole the food and have no proof of the poisoning to show in court? On top of that you can defend that you like your food spicy or that you have digestive issues and aren\u2019t good with eating pills so you put it in your food occasionally. \n\nLaw or not if someone is stealing my shit they are already crossing the line for breaking the law and disrespecting the person who\u2019s food they are eating, they deserve what\u2019s coming if they want to continue down that path.", "A+ sandwich stealth right here", "Well actual losse in most places, not pain and suffering which are intangible, but yeah.", "This might be an unpopular comment, but it's very hard times right now. Lots of people with full time jobs living in their cars. Is it possible he needs the food?", "I took someone\u2019s lunch a few times at the first school I taught at. I would put mine on a shelf in the fridge, and it got pushed back by other people then someone else put theirs in that spot. So I would take theirs by mistake. I was normally annoyed because I thought I had grabbed my girlfriend\u2019s lunch when I left the house and just tossed a lot of it (vegan issue). This other teacher eventually noticed the same bag but with weird hippie food and mentioned it in a meeting. She accepted my sheepish apology and we took to labeling the bags", "You trust your freedom on your limited understanding of the law well be my guest. You\u2019re wrong but I don\u2019t have to live with your decision.", "Yup, I sure do. \n\nThere is no right or wrong. You choose to live your life completely by the book, which is fine, but I choose to take matters into my own hands when things are objectively unfair and someone is taking advantage of me by stealing out of my pocket. Even if that decision means taking a small risk. \n\nIn Canada, where I live, if someone breaks into your house, you cannot do them any harm or you will be charged accordingly, EVEN if it\u2019s in self defence. Would you sit idly by as someone steals your belongings and threatens your family with a weapon? Would you watch as your wife or daughter is sexually assaulted because the law says if you do anything you\u2019ll be locked up? \n\nSo yea las61918, if someone\u2019s stealing the food I paid for time and time again & leaving me with an empty belly at lunch time, you\u2019re damn right I\u2019m going to spike it with the hottest peppers I can find or a couple of laxatives to make them think about their future choices.", "True!!!!! Send her a nice big fat bill"]}
