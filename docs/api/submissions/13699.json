I would know IMMEDIATELY of it wasn\u2019t my sandwich because I make it myself lmao very specific ingredients in different sandwiches a", "NTA for confronting the food thief, but maybe a bit of an AH for holding a grudge and behaving so that other co-workers are affected by the tension in the office.", "NTA for confronting them especially since this was an ongoing problem.  That said, I'd agree at this point to let it go.", "NTA and you should make them pay for what they ate. If they don't, go inform HR that they have a food thief in the company.", "NTA \n\nI would see if it happens again and if it does report it to HR.", "NTA.... but [he ate YOUR sandwich??!!](https://youtu.be/wbwvnFW4Pn4)", "NTA. Honestly, this is so selfish and obnoxious of them. What do they think is going to happen when they steal food?! OF COURSE they know that the victim will go hungry that day, and it's costing the victim money. But they clearly don't care about any of that, as long as they thought they could get away with it. \n\nThen they tried to insult your intelligence, by claiming it was a 'mistake' - even though you knew your food had been regularly going missing. So they broke trust lying to you, as well. The only way I'd have any more sympathy, is if they are experiencing genuine financial hardship. But even then - there are foodbanks, rather than screwing their colleague over. \n\nThey are lucky to get off with a warning from you, and some lingering anger. Many people would have reported them to HR already. However, DO be aware you're in a tricky position now. If you continue being obviously angry with them, they might be immoral enough to try to turn the tables on you - and claim to HR, that you're making their workplace unnecessarily hostile over an honest 'mistake'. And then it's your word against theirs'.\n\nSo do just be aware of that, especially since other colleagues have noticed your ongoing anger. With a bit of luck, your colleague won't consider complaining to HR, because they won't want HR to hear your claims about the food stealing.", "Your co worker is a thief. Thieves are best avoided. NTA.", "NTA - But you are the AH if you don't take it higher up the chain. Thieves are a nightmare in a workplace.", "NTA for confronting the food thief. If it hasn\u2019t happened since, why hold on to the anger. It only hurts you at this point. Label your lunch well and keep it moving.", "I\u2019d make a separate lunch and put some Mira lax or something like that in it. When he eats it he\u2019ll poop his pants. Karma!", "My breakfast went missing from the staff fridge one day when I was like 6 months pregnant. I made a loud generic stink (not at any particular person) about someone stealing food from my unborn child and when I went back into the break room fridge a few minutes later, my (unopened) breakfast was front and center on the top shelf.", "my sandwich?  \n  \n  \u2026MY SANDWICH?!  \n  \n*(birds scatter)*", "NTA. Your coworker insulted your intelligence by saying them eating your lunch REGULARLY was an \u201caccident\u201d. It would\u2019ve escalated a lot had I caught them in the act. Report them to HR.", "NTA tell your co-workers you prefer not to associate with people like that. They have been stealing your food for weeks and you know what they say show me who your friends are and that tells me who you are\u2026. Don\u2019t like people who do things like that. It\u2019s no different than me taking taking money from your wallet.", "Nta. Tell HR about the petty theft. Continue not speaking to your coworker", "Time to put some laxative in your food", "Easy for the coworkers to say that you should forgive and forget when they aren\u2019t having their food stolen every day\u2026 NTA.", "NTA\n\nI had this same situation happen to me. I left a note on my sandwich in the fridge so it was clearly mine. What\u2019s worse is it was during the holidays so it was this epic turkey sandwich with cranberries and an extra layer of bread with gravy on it. Anyway, when I found out that the person couldn\u2019t even finish it and threw a large potion away I lost my shit!!! Unfortunately my work made me take some time off after the incident. I\u2019m still salty about my sandwich.", "I think stealing lunches at work is the lowest of the low. If it was a mistake, you\u2019d realize it wasn\u2019t yours and notify the offended party that you owe them lunch. I worked in office building that was not walkable to any place that had food.  That mofo would be ordering Grubhub for me because I\u2019m a bitch if I don\u2019t eat. NTA. He deserved to be called out. He was probably eating other people\u2019s food as well.", "NTA, it was a mistake every day for weeks?  Also, the open the sandwich, and don't look at it and think \"I made peanut butter, this appears to be turkey, I'm going to eat it anyway.  I genuinely don't understand how eating someone else's food is anything other than intentional.", "NTA It isn't just food. Food is expensive and takes time to prepare. He is taking away the cost of the ingredients and your labour. It must add up to quite a bit of money.  a thief is a thief. Forgiveness comes after consequences and apologies.", "Most definitely NTA. Anyone saying otherwise is fucking delusional. Since when is it okay to just eat other people's food? Like, wtf? And all the assholes at work telling you to let it slide probably wouldn't if it were them in your position. What if you had low blood sugar or some other medical condition where you had dietary restrictions, only to get to the fridge and find it gone?? Absolutely unacceptable behavior from a grown adult, and as you've stated, it's causing you to spend more money on meals. Inform HR and get that paper trail going. If it keeps happening and nothing gets done, I'd say it's on sight in the parking lot.", "\"thought it was theirs\"....so where was their food? Naw, they were being rude and lazy and making a conscious Chioce to take your food. If it happened Once I MIGHT buy their story but WEEKS? Nope. They can buy you lunch to make up for it if they want to smooth things over but you don't have to do shit\n\nNTA btw. Your coworker was taking advantage of your niceness", "NTA.  It's not an honest mistake, if it was they would have given you the lunch(es) they brought.  Take it to HR.", "*Ross : You ate my sandwich?\nDr. Ledbetter: It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.\nRoss : Oh-oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your *own* turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?*\n\nNTA once could be a mistake (it wasn\u2019t) but multiple times? And it was always your food\u2026? Nope.", "NTA but I'm petty enough to put something unpleasant or spicy  in the next lunch you take to work to catch them out. Some wasabi would work well.", "NTA, I work in a warehouse and one year working nights someone had eaten my Christmas dinner when I obviously couldn't replace it or go anywhere because of the holiday.\n\nEveryone knew who did it but laughed it off and nothing happened, but God forbid you steal the smallest thing from the warehouse, that is instant termination.\n\nIf your stuff was clearly marked, I say they should get fired. In my eyes, stealing from coworkers should carry the punishment as stealing from the company.", "NTA.\n\nA coworker once drank my Coke that was in the fridge, because he thought it was his. When I asked, \"Did someone drink my Coke?\" he immediately fessed up, said he thought it was his, and bought me a new one to replace it. \n\nThat's what people do when they make an honest mistake.", "So when you said, \u201cwhere\u2019s your sandwich then.

He may have as well offered OP to buy lunch too (in addition to giving his sandwich), if he was a decent person.\n\n.... and no, OP, it's not just about the food. You just learned that your coworker is a lying freeloader.\n\nNTA, obviously.", "Oh it\u2019s BS. Ditto on the HR thing for a trail.", "I like how the food stealer played it off as a mistake but OP says it\u2019s happened more than once. Even if someone else makes your lunch you know what is and isn\u2019t yours. Most people would ask if they weren\u2019t sure instead of taking the food and assuming. I think it was the first time the lunch thief was caught and confronted.", "Yeah.  I considered the sympathetic reasons as well.  And it would make sense why they wouldn't want to admit to that.  But there's no real way to know either for us or OP.", "Lol.  That reminds me of a story of my life.  Picked up a case of beer from the deli.  Got into the car, put the beer in the passenger seat.  Key wouldn't turn on.  Thats when i noticed the young lady staring at me from outside.  That's when i suddenly saw my car parked next to it.\n\nSeriously, same make, model and color (and not even a common color).  We even had the same air freshener hanging from the mirror.  She was a good sport and we both had a good laugh.  Turned out she was even buying the same beer.", "Truly incredible how he and OP happen to make the exact same sandwich all the time too lmao", "Food tampering, even if it's your own to set a \"trap\" is illegal.  If one had fallen sideways and they swallowed it, and got it caught in his throat or something, he'd be out a heck of a lot more money than a sandwich. You'll note that when restaurants pin sandwiches with with an extra long toothpick with brightly colored flags or cellophane on the end to call attention to it. If this were an AITA story, it's definitely YTA.", "It's not a trap. The toothpicks are meant to hold the sandwich together and they had to be broken, so it'd fit properly in the container/not tear the bag. That's my story and I'm sticking with it.", "Good grief you guys need to lighten up.\n\nThis happened decades ago, I'm not actively doing this. Also I'm in Canada... the whole suing over everything for anything factor doesn't even come into my mind.\n\nOur motto is more 'do stupid things win stupid prizes'", "Be open to the idea that they are not the only one doing it.", "Still going to end badly for you.\n\nYou have no way of proving it was them the other times- or that the other times even happened.\n\n\nMeanwhile all they have to do is say they mistook it for their sandwich. If they had to seek medical care because of it or took photos after the fact they can even prove it happened \n\nSo now the judge has you, who is accusing someone of repetitive thefts and admits to booby trapping something and someone who says someone must have stolen their lunch and that they thought this was theirs but it hurt them.\n\nHow do you think that will end for you?", "I'm a lawyer and I'm with you!", "Well I'm in Canada... and we can't sue in the same way the US does... it's like a sickness in thr US... thr suing over everything. \nYou can take someone to small claims court for big stuff... but otherwise it's pretty near impossible", "Well I'm in Canada... sooo all suing and medical expense is nonsense because we dont/can't sue over stupid stuff like that. :)", "They really ought to have fired him.
