Even though they claimed that it was an honest mistake, I didn't believe them and accused them of stealing my food. I might have come across as aggressive and accusatory, which could have hurt their feelings and damaged our working relationship. In retrospect, I could have handled the situation differently by calmly explaining the issue and asking them to be more careful in the future, rather than jumping to conclusions and assuming the worst.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If he was doing it for weeks, he would do it forever if he was never confronted. \n\nYour coworkers are telling you to forgive and forget, but are they telling the sandwich thief to make up for what he did?

Thieves who try to make you feel bad for being upset at their THEFT are not to be trusted under any circumstances. NTA at all, go to HR if you have one in case of possible retaliation. Always document all thefts in the workplace, if they'll steal from you, they'll steal from your employer.", "NTA- this is theft. You should have also gone to HR after confronting them. If you have not done this- I would just to get it on record so that if this somehow gets twisted, you reported it. \n\nBe open to the idea that they are not the only one doing it.

I seriously don\u2019t understand how there are people in this world that eat other coworkers lunches. And like not just once!!! No way one does not know exactly what food is theirs and what isn\u2019t. Ugggh this is so irritating. \n\nBut screw confronting them and making it awkward on your end. I woulda spiked that food w ghost peppers, laxatives whatever and taught em a good lesson. Then they could sit in the awkwardness knowing you know and did something about it too. Perk- the innocent coworkers are none the wiser.", "Thought it was theirs... So your coworker could have given you theirs as compensation, if it was a mistake.

You are smart to avoid them.", "Edited NTA (I n f o supplied below) - How often has this happened before? You say it's been weeks but do you have a more specific number of times?", "yeah they definitely knew it wasn't theirs.\nif you want to be nice about it, bring something in one day that you can share with everyone and make the distinguishment between what is personal and what is shared. maybe label your stuff, too.", "NTA Everyone knows what they pack for their lunch.

They KNOW they didnt buy that meal/make that sandwich/pick up that bag of chips, so I'm calling bullshit.  I may also be reliving getting home to my first flat and seeing that my flatmates had eaten my snacks. Again.", "NTA, you have the right to suspect he was taking your food all these weeks (I sorta doubt that multiple people were taking your food, so), but be open to the possibility that others were taking it too.\n\nAlso, did you mention someone's been taking your food for weeks and confront him about that too? Or does he/everyone think you're mad about a one-off? Either way NTA but if he thinks this is over a one-time thing then might be a bit much to stop talking to him completely but if you made it clear that this wasn't the first time, I'd say your response is more understandable, but I'd still try to move on if he does stop taking your food.", "NTA. They\u2019re an asshole and we\u2019re doing it on purpose. Also, nobody there knows your financial situation. What if you couldn\u2019t afford to replace lunch on a day they decided to steal? \n\nBut I understand why your co workers want you to move on.

Set up a dummy meal with laxatives.", "NTA. If the co worker honestly made a mistake and grabbed the wrong one thinking it was their sandwich that meant it would have had to have been the same type they brought in for themselves. Did they have one to give to you?", "I remember a post where an Indian spiked his food with ghost peppers to poison the office food thief. \n\nYou can make a sandwich and put ex lax with Mayo. Leave it out for them to find.", "NTA", "INFO: Has your colleague been showing signs of forgetfulness in other aspects in the workplace?\n\nI've had a colleague take my yogurt from a shared fridge before, because they'd thought it was one of theirs - a genuine mistake which was easily understandable because yogurts have a longer life, can as result be sat in the fridge for more than a day or two, and it was one of the flavours of a brand they liked to buy themselves. Their solution: apologise profusely, buy a replacement for me, and start labelling the lids their own yogurts so they didn't accidentally take anyone else's in future. (I didn't mind, btw.)\n\nBut a sandwich is different. It doesn't sit in the fridge for more than a week before being eaten, normally it would be eaten same day or at most the next. And if you bring it from home, unless you buy it from your local store the night before or that morning just because it is cheaper than stores near your workplace, it is in your own packaging (box or wrap) and are essentially customised by the bread and fillings. Which means it is so much harder to genuinely make a mistake like this. Even if you box or wrap your sandwiches the same, accidentally grab someone else's from the fridge, you'd know that is not your bread/that is not the sandwich you prepared...and stop.\n\nI don't think you are TA for confronting your colleague, in itself, since you caught them in the act this one time, but if there was already element of forgetfulness (suggestive of anything from absentmindedness or early dementia) then you may have gone about wrongly.", "NTA for being upset at them for taking your lunch but be careful about your level of response. There was a similar situation where I work and the person taking the food was ostracized by staff members. They complained to HR and people got written up for it. Feel free to hold a grudge but make sure you remain civil.", "Info: is your food labeled with your name?", "ESH\n\nIts over.
