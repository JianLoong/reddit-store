Kid needs to be taught a lesson and it has to be soon so this can be nipped in the bud.

She is disrespecting you and enabling her son to do so as well with a ridiculous justification. You need to sort this out or get out before it gets worse.\n\n*What would her reaction be is you had a child or nibbling and encouraged them to treat her this way?*", "NTA. Dude, lose the girlfriend. She clearly is not interested in teaching her kids manners, 9 years old is old enough to learn, \"he can't help it\" is no excuse, the only thing this phrase scream is bad parenting because the parents are too lazy. \n\nAlso, she said it was OK for him to be rude to you if you weren't listening??? Have some self love and self respect. The first step telling him you won't allowed it, you nailed it, now you need the second step: tell your girlfriend that is not ok.", "NTA DUMP her and her rotten kid.  It's only gonna get worse.  She is not teaching her kid any kind of respect or manners.  It's only gonna get worse with each passing year.  Just imagine him when he is a teenager.  She clearly does not care about you and has no respect.  Find someone who will be a partner and not a hag", "LOL this is a girlfriend issue.", "Is Mom going to prison for him when he gets older gets angry and decides to off some guy who he thinks disrespected him. But my Mommy said I could. OP please break it off with Mom. She will probably let any bio kids do the same.", "What I got from this post is that son got picked up, then they basically ignored him to talk about THEIR day. Doesn't work like that. It's the time to ask all of the questions of this kid. School/friends/life. Captive audience. Yes he was rude, but he should be able to talk to his Mom. Both of you were rude.  His Mom should have been talking to her son.", "If he usually doesn't let the child interrupt a discussion then op is the Ah here.", "He already wrote that the kid can talk after the CONVERSATION BETWEEN ADULTS IS OVER . He s the Ah, that's why his gf told her child he can interrupt op whenever he considers it necessary.", "Or she has different expectation re: conversation and who is by default involved.\n\nThey were in a car and driving. OP took it for granted that he and his GF, the adults, were having a one on one conversation and that the stepson, being a kid, was not involved, and therefore needed to wait until they were done to butt in.\n\nThe GF seems to think that if there are 3 people in the car, there are 3 people in the conversation and OP is failing at basic turn taking when he's not letting his stepson get a word in.", "You are ridiculous. He was teaching the child that when ANYONE is talking, it\u2019s rude to interrupt. Now I know why we have so many unhinged adults in society today smfh", "I wouldn't consider this him parenting, as much as it is him setting a boundary of how he won't accept being spoken to with disrespect. \n\nIf the son wouldn't speak to a teacher or other family member this way, why does OP deserve this kind of treatment?", "The problem here seems to be that you viewed the car ride as you and your GF having a conversation that your stepson tried to interrupt.\n\n  \nBut your GF and your stepson viewed is as the three of you having a conversation and you not letting your stepson join in.\n\n  \nIn what other context does this usually happen and if your stepson was an adult, would you expect him to be part of the convo? Because yeah, I can see this go both way.", "How do you know if it's important if you don't let him Talk?! \n\nYTA for this attitude alone", "How? Interrupting is rude af? For teaching him MANNERS?", "To some people the CONVERSATION means finishing their sentences.  Or it could mean that he wants to finish his 30 minute narration about his day.", "Yeah, now I understand why only certain peoples kids are allowed to play with mine, apparently it\u2019s abusive to have manners. Who knew?", "It's also rude to monopolize the conversation and not let one person get a word in. Depending on how long it went on, OP would be considered rude AF if he kept having a one-on-one convo with his gf while ignoring the third person in the car.", "You know the answer is unflattering when they avoid the important questions like the plague in favor of a still unflattering comment.", "It\u2019s giving off the \u201cit\u2019s rude to interrupt ANY conversation unless it\u2019s an emergency \u201c vibe to me.", "Im also wondering if the kid actually \u201cinterrupted\u201c or was simply trying to join the conversation. Given OPs attitude I\u2019m inclined to think it\u2019s the latter.", "If he wants the kid to wait until the conversation is OVER whenever that is then Yes he s the AH. You wait for a pause and ask something not until THEY FINISHED TALKING.", "Since the kid's mother said he's always doing this I don't think op meant sentence by saying conversation. Sorry.\n\nAND if so the op needs to get a freaking dictionary and learn the meaning of the words he is using.", "No, and I\u2019m not replying at all to you. There are two types of people in this world, those who project issues and those who actually see them. \n\nYou do wait until someone stops speaking until you speak. You got some trauma going on, so I\u2019ll let you deal with that. Get some therapy. There is nothing wrong with teaching children not to speak when someone else is. Smh", "A conversation can be any length of time.  Maybe you need to understand words better? \n\nI think OP is likely the AH and stated in my post that if everyone else thinks it\u2019s an issue, it probably is.   But I don\u2019t think my comment trying to clarify the length of the \u201cCONVERSATIONS\u201d was irrelevant", "Not saying it isn't. I am not a native English speaker. But from my understanding of this particular post and op s attitude this and the other occasions he did this do not feel as short since the mother told her kid to ignore op and speak when he needs to.", "But op doesn't want the child to interrupt until the adult conversation is over. So the boy has to wait until op is ok with it? How would op even know if it's urgent since he refused to let the child interrupt at All?!", "Of course he doesn't, no-one wants to be interrupted, but you can politely interject. Op would know it was urgent, if the child said \"its urgent\" or \"I need to ask mum something now\" instead of saying \"shut up I want to ask my mum something\" if the child had time to be rude then he had time to interject politely.", "In this case the kid just started talking , didn't manage to ask a complete question and op berated him and told him not to interrupt . When exactly should the child had the time to say anything?! \n\nOr did I read this wrong?", "It never said he berated him. It just said the kid tried to interrupt, he asked him to wait his turn and let them finish their conversation, then the kid told him to shut up he wanted to ask his mum something. We don't know how much the kid said before he was asked to wait his turn."]}
