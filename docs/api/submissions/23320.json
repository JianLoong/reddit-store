Have you had a conversation with your partner about her parenting style and the role she wants you to play in her son's life? What do your attempts at \"parenting\" him look like?", "When the kid interrupts is it typically important or does he (and apparently mom) feel its acceptable to interrupt adults for childish reasons? Children have to learn respectful behaviour and sometimes that means waiting to speak. If its urgent \u201cI really have too pee!\u201d Is a valid reason to interrupt however, \u201cI got high score on Mario kart\u201d while parents are in the middle of a conversation isn\u2019t a valid reason and can wait. Mom telling the kid its ok to be rude because step dad \u201cdoesn\u2019t let him interrupt\u201d is not ok. Mom should have acknowledged the kid, herself to check if the interruption was warranted in which case OP should follow mom\u2019s lead.", "I'm sorry. Did you say your girlfriend told her son that he could tell you to shut-up?\n\nYou have a girlfriend problem, my dude. NTA for telling him that he was being disrespectful (and interrupting conversations is rude, regardless of age) but it's his mother who bears the responsibility here.", "I think you have a major problem.\n\nYou are with someone 3 years and your gf says the kid telling you to shut up is OK.\n\nIf he tells you to shut up and your girlfriend doesn't have a problem with it it's the same as your girlfriend telling you to shut up.\n\nI'm not going to render judgement but I'll give some advice.\n\nKid might have been right to tell you to shut up. Either way if the kid was right you need to shut and get out of the relationship or the kid was wrong and your girlfriend was approving of you being disrespected. Either way get out.", "> he is only 9 and can\u2019t help it\n\nThat\u2019s the problem right there. He\u2019s nine and he CAN help it, he should\u2019ve been taught manners a long time ago. Tbh if this were a one-time thing then he should be reminded to be nice/polite. However, given that momma seems to have given him a pass to do this whenever he wants, it looks like this is going to be an issue.\n\nY\u2019all may not agree on parenting styles and it\u2019s true that she has more authority because she\u2019s his parent and you\u2019re not (not bio, at least) but there should be some sort of mutual respect here. Kid needs to be taught a lesson and it has to be soon so this can be nipped in the bud. Interrupting people like this (unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary) is impolite and momma isn\u2019t doing him any favors by letting him get away with this. \n\nNTA", "You are not married to this woman, and he is not your kid. She doesn't respect you, and it will get worse as the kid gets older. Release them back to the streets and go enjoy your life.", "NTA\n\nBut i hope you understand, that the disrespect you got from her son is in fact your gf disrespecting you. \n\nI don't care how good your gf looks or how exiting she is in bed, if you let her treat you this way, you can look forward to a life full of getting disrespected - if you go this path its definitly your own fault. She waved her red flags now and you saw them - make with it what you want.", "NTA - this is only going to get worse", "NTA. Your partner is teaching her child it's okay to be rude to you. Who needs that? She doesn't respect you. Dump her", "Ok NTA but this is a problem between you and your wife. You need to talk to her and find a balance between not parenting him but also him showing you the do respect as the man of the house. If she thinks its ok for him to treat you that way it is a massive problem.", "NTA. Not sure about your wife though.", "Nta. Your gf is enabling bad behavior so her son doesn\u2019t favor his father over her. It\u2019s a common mistake divorces parents make. As someone that has been in multiple relationships with single mothers as well as a stepdad I can tell you that unless you sit her down and set boundaries about this it\u2019s only going to get worse. Also maybe discuss her lack of respect for you. If she respects you she won\u2019t let her son disrespect you.", "INFO:\n\nDo you interrupt him? Are you one of those adults who thinks children should be seen and not heard? Why is your conversation more important than one he might need to have with his parent?", "Well, you probably shouldn\u2019t be trying to *Parent* him if she isn\u2019t on board \n\nBut reasonable rules/standards would have to any kid ?  Yea your gf is out of line letting him cuss at you.  If she has a problem with you not letting him interrupt SHE needs to lead not allow this", "NTA\nYour partner has failed to teach her son basic respect for others. That's on her. Red flag my dude.", "NTA\n\nYou need to have a serious talk with your GF, she\u2019s raising an entitled brat of a kid. And if she thinks it\u2019s ok then you should really think about if this is the type of person you want to build a relationship with", "When two entirely separate people are saying you have a tendency to talk over your son, believe them. Maybe you don't realise you do it - maybe you interject too much, maybe you just listen to reply rather than listen to understand. Maybe your voice is heard too much in any given conversation.\n\nYour son's language was not okay - but I'm guessing he, along with your ex and your current girlfriend are frustrated because you're not getting the more subtle hints they've dropped.", "YTA. You aren\u2019t giving the whole story, but if you\u2019ve pushed a kid who is so cared about the words he uses into telling you to shut up, then you\u2019re doing something wrong. He even told you exactly what the problem is. You don\u2019t let him speak. Now, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s something more innocent like he\u2019s feeling left out for some reason, or that you are simply ignoring him, or if you are treating him with that old \u201cKids should be seen but not heard\u201d sentiment. But you need to figure out how to solve this problem. The fact that your girlfriend has told him to speak up means she recognizes the problem too. The AH part is the fact that you are dwelling on the kids undesirable behavior, despite the fact that it is out of character for him, without reflecting on your role in why he is feeling this way.", "NTA. My daughter is 6yo, and I'm teaching her that you have to wait your turn to speak. A 9yo is more than capable of waiting. I can't believe him mum said it was ok. If I were you I would really think about where you stand in this blended family. Are you happy to be disrespected for the rest of your life.", "Being disrespectfull is not oke of course, but you should ask yourself if he was just being disrespectfull or didn't know how to express himself. Not interupting whenever is a fine thing to teach a child, but never being able to talk whille adults are talking does not do a child any favours.", "YTA.\n\nBased on this sentence alone: \"you need to let him talk when he needs to and you always do this to him.\"\n\nConfirmed by what you said in the comment: \" I won't ignore him but will have him wait and not interrupt unless it is important but then he'll usually just say what it is, if he feels it is important.\"\n\nYou basically silence your step-son and when it comes back to bite you you are unhappy about it?\n\nI dont understand why the mother would even submit her son to your parenting.\n\nChildren should always come before partners.", "NTA sounds like typical no father figure issue. You need to stand your ground while understanding the kid's probably going through shit, where's his BIO dad?", "I would have said, unequivocally N T A, but then I read this:\n\n>My partner then got pissed off at me, telling me that \"you need to let him talk when he needs to and you always do this to him.\"\n\nDo you often ignore your stepson? \n\nI think, in this specific example, NTA, because it's never OK to tell someone to \"shut up.\"", "YTA. That wasn\u2019t going to be my opinion at first. You aren\u2019t the parent. You are mom\u2019s friend. Her current lay you don\u2019t parent the kid like that. And when the mom says \u201cyou always do this to him \u201c you need to hear that. You also refer to the child as a mama\u2019s boy.     You said this is a child that doesn\u2019t say things for fear of getting in trouble, what caused him to snap this time. \n\nYou need to have a talk with mom and figure out what your place is. But you aren\u2019t a parent.", "YTA\n\nHe needed to ask his mother something. You need to stop not letting him into the conversation just because he is a child.", "YTA:\n\nThis might be bad advice, but this is my take.\n\nIt\u2019s not your job to Parent, at least for now. You are the boyfriend.\n\nI barely trusted my mother\u2019s boyfriends, when ever they tried to parent me I felt like they were trying to control me.\n\nIt was only after my mother married her husband did I have enough trust in him to allow him be an authority figure in my life, and it\u2019s taken years for me to heed his advice.\n\nNot to say three years is nothing but to the kid it\u2019s probably only felt like one, if not half. The trust this kid has in you is still so fragile.\n\nHowever, the kid is 9; their world is so small that it tends to revolve around them. Heck the kid is a year or two from the \u201cI know everything because I made up random facts\u201d stage.\n\nBe more patient; if you can.\n\nHowever mostly I think this is a \u201csit down; talk to the significant other and have a deep conversation\u201d kind of thing.\n\n This kind of thing can make or break a relationship OP.", "YTA.
