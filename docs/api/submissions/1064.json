Honestly sounds like she's gas lighting you. Video evidence just exposed her and she's mad that you finally have proof.", "Make sure you take that tape to a lawyer. NTA.", "Give her the dogs (so she has no excuse to come over) and wash your hands of each other", "ESH I have no doubt that she is toxic and abusive, especially since others have also noticed these things. \n\nBut the things with knowing your recording an arguement between two people, and you're one of those people, means that you will change the way you act. So it doesn't really provide an accurate account of what has happened in the past. \n\nThere are better ways of handling these situations and recording them and then sharing them with others, probably isn't the best way.", "This is a tough one. I understand why you did it. And it did clear some things up for you, but . . . ESH.\n\nFirst your ex-wife. She cheated and blamed you for her cheating. This is narcissistic behavior. That being the case, good riddance to her. You're better off without her.\n\nAs for you, I'm not cool with you secretly recording someone, then showing your private conversation with outsiders. Again, I understand why; you did need validation. But you could have just shared your story and still gotten the validation you needed. I would recommend therapy for you. I don't say this to be cruel. But it sounds like you lack confidence in your own convictions. Even without knowing the details, it sounds like she was being abusive. She's trying to convince you that it's your fault she cheated and that tells me all I need to know.\n\nIt sounds like a domestic abuser mentality. \"I'm sorry, honey, but if you wouldn't make me so angry, I wouldn't have to be abusive!\" \n\nBut the fact that you even doubt yourself in this situation tells me that you're vulnerable to manipulation by selfish and cruel people. Perhaps some therapy will acquaint you with the warning signs, so you're not taken advantage of like this again.\n\nAnd since you have the recording, you may as well share it with your therapist. Yes, I'm aware that your therapist would be an outsider, and I just came down on your for sharing it with outsiders, but this is different. A therapist is sworn to confidentiality. And since you have the recording, which you shouldn't have done, you may as well put it to the best possible use.", "NTA. She's not upset so much about being recorded as she is upset about the fact that you were able to show others exactly how she's been abusing you. This is definitely not healthy. Run as fast as you can and ban her from entering your house. You can open the door to let her take the dogs if needed and refuse to interact with her beyond that.", "NTA", "NTA, especially if she is exhibiting the kind of behavior that makes people concerned for your safety.\n\nThis relationship sounds extremely toxic, and I would make sure to limit all contact as much as possible, and maybe continue to record your interactions for your own safety. She clearly kicked off because she doesn't like the fact that other people have now witnessed her shitty behavior. Knowing that you are likely to be recording your interactions may make her act in a more appropriate way.\n\nCut all ties with this person the minute you are able to do so would be my best advice.", "What is toxic on his side?\n\nHis family is worried about his safety after seeing how she treats them while they are alone, he is being gaslit so hard that he has to keep a record of their conversations and film their interactions just to be sure how they actually went, she tells him stuff like, \u201cno one will believe you\u201d when he confronts her, and she cheated on him. \n\nWhat is toxic on his end?

You did the right thing getting help, listen to your family and go see a lawyer take that video with you!", "NTA. She's deflecting by saying you invaded her privacy (while you were documenting her being abusive to you). If she's done something you can charge her with, you can add a restraining order (N16A) to that to protect yourself you know.", "NTA.  My main concern was the legality of doing it without her knowledge but you said you checked on that and are ok.  She's mad because she got caught and can't try to manipulate her way out of it.", "NTA at all. It\u2019s good you successfully recorded the interaction and could get second opinions. ETA it does sound like some issues all around in the relationship tho. If you want to work through cheating and she doesn\u2019t then she potentially cheated to feel valid in ending the relationship.", "NTA she\u2019s abused you and cheated on you. Take your dogs and cut her out completely", "ESH\n\nAs an abuse survivor, I pray you'll hear me out.\n\nYour relationship is toxic, and instead of ending the relationship, you're holding onto it and letting the toxicity fester.\n\nI'd recommend looking up the \"Drama Triangle.\" People in toxic relationships often switch between the victim, rescuer, and perpetrator roles - for example, people who endure a lot of abuse will sometimes switch into the abuser role temporarily after becoming resentful and fed up.\n\nIt sounds like you've suffered from abuse from this woman. Now, you feel the need to record her without her knowledge and showcase what an awful bitch she is (even though everyone is already supporting you). She may deserve it, but it's not a good look and isn't going to improve your mental health or self esteem.\n\nIf you stay involved in this, it will turn you into a miserable AH.\n\nGet a divorce and get this woman out of your life.\n\nUnless you're working with a lawyer and think you can get some financial benefit from this, you don't need to waste energy to \"prove\" what an AH she is - relationships are voluntary and you're allowed to leave if you're miserable. \n\nStop worrying about whether you overreacted to this thing or that thing. Pay attention to how you've felt about yourself while with her. That's what matters, and that's all the justification you need to wash your hands of her.\n\nStop stalling and move on with your life.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't record her to put her on YT or something but to look at a situation with a bit of distance and to get an outside perspective from your family. It seems like it was a good idea and warranted. Her going off about it so much, might also be an indication that she is fully aware of her behavior and how it is wrong, but doesn't want you to have any concrete evidence if it where it wouldn't just be her word against yours anymore. Do continue recording your interactions and do not delete the recordings, just in case.", "Info: why have your friends and family have concerns about your safety?", "If legal - not a problem.  \nMoral is another thing - but if she indeed used the words \"no one knows\" as if that were a good thing - yeah - you are clear.\n\nJust do not post on public networks etc - private viewing only.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "She cheated...

I tried to respond as normally as I would have. That is to say, short somewhat curt answers, but knowing that I was filming does alter my responses.\nIt helped to watch it back myself though, and see the behaviour. It also made my family feel, that now I was starting to see it, they could express their concerns, and how they'd had them for a while.\nThank you for your input though.", "Are you telling an abuse victim they did wrong by getting proof of their abuse or that they reached out for help from their family because they are being abused and manipulated?", "Already in therapy, and seeking more, but thanks for your input. I see what you mean.", "Recording abuse is totally valid. My abuser was pissed when I tried to record instances of his behavior bc he didn\u2019t want people to see it.

And they only became afraid after seeing footage of what happened AFTER he let her into the house.", "I think she sounds like a classic case of a narcissist (because of the gas lighting) and he sounds like a victim who has an anxious attachment style?", "I see that, it's slightly complicated - I am afraid, as I don't know how she'll act, but I'm also afraid of upsetting her, if that makes sense? The idea was she didn't need to see me to collect the dogs. She could just get them and go. That didn't happen.
