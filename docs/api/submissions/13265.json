He said many other vulgar things that I want to forget. I needed time to process the embarrassment and I usually laugh when nervous or embarrassed.

Not even my fiancee)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway MIL contacted my fianc\u00e9 and asked him if I still had time to find a new dress to my engagement party. SIL knew that MIL has seen the dress so she (mil) asked to see it). Apparently it was very revealing according to SIL and she wasn't sure if she wanted to come if I didn't change dress. ESPECIALLY when I loved the attention from her husband (because I laughed). I said no I won't change my dress, now my fiancee is sad that his sister doesn't want to attend. and both SIL and MIL think I'm an attention seeking AH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[this is the dress.

This is the rest of your life and the family you are marrying into. It won\u2019t end with an engagement party dress. BIL is already lusting after you so it doesn\u2019t matter what you wear. There will be other times he will be drunk and it won\u2019t stop with comments. The old catch you alone in the kitchen is a familiar one. Have a long talk with your fianc\u00e9 about how he needs to stand up for you. If he still defends his sister and mother, you have your answer.", "NTA. You call that revealing!!! That's not revealing at all. I've seen girls going to prom in dresses more revealing than that. \n\nIt's a beautiful dress by the way.", "NTA but before you marry into this family, you need to make sure that your future husband has your back. Your husband should not have tolerated his sister\u2019s husband to talk to you that way or allowed his sister and mother to make you feel ashamed for that man\u2019s bad behavior. If hubby can\u2019t stand up to his family, you are in for a very unhappy life especially because the sister has already sized you up as a threat.", "NTA SIL husband is a creep", "NTA \n\nYou are not responsible for a grown ass man saying inappropriate things about you. \n\nHer problem is with him, not you, and this is not your burden to bear. It is unfair to ask you to modify your existence to make him less attracted to you when you don\u2019t even want his attention in the first place. \n\nAlso- please consider carrying bear mace or wasp spray when you\u2019re around this absolute creep. I\u2019d also consider banning him from the wedding and uninviting him from the engagement party- but that might just be me. \u201cNope, sorry SIL- I won\u2019t be changing my dress to make you feel better about your dude staring at me. But I tell ya what- he\u2019s no longer even invited, so it\u2019s now a non-issue! You can still come if you want, though!\u201d", "NTA\n\nSend her a message.\n\n\u201cSIL, it has gotten back to me that you didn\u2019t like how I reacted to your husband at the party. I thought to let you know that I laugh when I am uncomfortable and I was VERY uncomfortable bc everyone let your husband make disgusting remarks about me and not one person stood up and stopped his remarks/ sexual harassment. No I won\u2019t be changing my dress. Maybe you should be more concerned with your husbands behaviour instead of blaming the victim. I thought we were in the day and age that we stopped blaming the victim for what they were wearing and focussed on the harasser.\n\nIf he is willing to say that in public to family, what is he doing in private. You should be more concerned about that than what I will be wearing. \n\nIf you choose not to come to the engagement party then so be it, but please know from here on out your husband is not welcome around me\u2026including the engagement party and wedding. I hope you and your husband can realise what he did was not ok and is not acceptable. \u201c\n\nThen speak to your fianc\u00e9 . Tell him his behaviour was disappointing. That he needs to stand behind you in this or the wedding is off.", "NTA\n\nAnd tbh I'm super grossed out by your fiance...he should've defended you...she should've told your sister that her husband shouldn't leer you...that it's not your responsibility that his eyes wander\n\nHE SHOULD'VE STOOD UP FOR YOU THIS IS NOT OK", "NTA this is an easy one.  The trash is taking itself out.", "NTA sit that man down and tell him siding with his jealous misogynistic sister and manipulative controlling mother means you are reconsidering whether an engagement party is the right thing to do at this time. You were sexually harrassed by an obnoxious drunk. YOU are the wronged party here. But future MIL and SIL are blaming you and being controlling. They have terrible values and protect abusers. Tell him he can grow up and take his balls back from his mother and siater and defend you or he clearly isnt ready to be a husband to you or anyone else.  Then tell everyone you know who was invited ro the party what happened and that you will never be in the same room as BIL unless he 1)formally apologizes and 2) stays sober around you from this day forward. He lost his alcohol privileges. Tell FSIL her misogyny is gross and if she ever tries to control your clothing again you are done with her and her trashy abusive husband. For the future MIL, suggest she can attempt police your clothing and not be in your life or respect you as an adult and be in your life.  One or the other her choice. Unless you put your foot down hars right now, the rest of your marriage will be hell caused by these AHs. Good luck, but I would run.", "NTA. Tell them both firmly that you will not be changing your dress to your engagement party, but SIL can change her creepy husband. Perhaps he should be left of the guest list since he clearly doesn\u2019t know how to behave properly. \n\nI encourage you to practice how you may respond in future situations like this. I\u2019m a big fan of something like, \u201cEw BIL why are you being so creepy? Did you have too much to drink AGAIN?\u201d in a nice loud voice for everyone to hear. Rinse and repeat each time he pulls his BS. If no one else will stand up to him for his poor behavior, do it yourself.", "\"you know it's not my responsibility to keep your husband from being (fill in the blank), right?\"", "I think the real problem here is that the dress is $300 and looks poorly made. I understand the asymmetrical straps and the askew neckline are stylized, but OP, this isn\u2019t a great dress.\n\nNTA. But that dress is gonna be a \u201cno\u201d for me, dawg", "this and that dress is awesome", "Exactly! BIL should be apologizing for his inappropriate comments. Don't let anyone, your fiance included, victim blame you for being sexually harassed. Your fiance should be on your team here.", "Most people can be drunk without being creepy or perverted. BIL doesn\u2019t get a pass on these concerning behaviors simply because he was drunk.", "For me it's not about the dress. Fiance wants OP to bend to his family and not stand up for her about this but this is how he's going to be about other things to and let her be disrespected. SIL wants a dress change this time but next get together she'll want op in a potato sack because she still has a husband issue but it's easier to make op change into a potato sack and cry to get her way rather than deal with her creepy husband problem. They need to set boundaries and be a united front. The dress is just the battle but it's not the war.", "What is it with people, especially mother in laws and brides that makes them go completely insane over the simplest and most mundane things. Absolutely NTA!!!!!!!\n\nThe dress is gorgeous and I am sure you will wear it well.\n\nBut this whole situation revealed something more concerning. The reaction of your fiance speaks volumes and this is a red flag. Ask yourself, how many other red flags are you also not seeing?", "NTA why are you marrying a man that doesn't stand up for you when you are being harassed?", "Clicked on the link, hoping to see the most booby, revealing, scandalous piece of cloth that should never ever see the light of day for its promiscuity.\n\nNgl, was kinda disappointed by the dare I say boring design. This is not revealing at all? I mean, sure wouldn't wear it day to day to my corporate office job, but for a party?? Hell yes.\n\nNTA, what a mess, OP. SIL's husband should be punished for his harrassment.", "NTA. But don\u2019t make this about the dress. Even if you are wearing a bikini or less, it is still no reason for sexual harassment. Or, even in a potato bag this man will drip all over you, just because he can and feels enabled. \n\nSo stop that. Make it about his behavior, not your dress. Confront your fianc\u00e9 with his lack of protection, and tell him to silence his family. Creepy guy isn\u2019t welcome, and sil and mil only if they apologize for victim blaming. Setting that boundary now, will help you later on at all family gatherings, where you can simply state Not This Sexual harassment Again Larry!, every time you hear/sea h\u00edm doing something inappropriate. Cause my guess; you\u2019re not creepy guys first victim and won\u2019t be his last.", "That'd be cool with me. I'm 99.9% likely to be sober, so I'll fight him.", "This isn\u2019t about the Iranian yoghurt.", "The vast majority of engagement parties **are** evening cocktail parties, though??", "100% agreed. Only drunks and enablers think alcohol is a blanket excuse for bad behavior."]}
