Yesterday we were invited to my SIL's birthday party. (my fianc\u00e9's sister). Her husband got very drunk and said loudly to my fianc\u00e9 that I was so sexy and that my fianc\u00e9 was lucky. He said many other vulgar things that I want to forget. I needed time to process the embarrassment and I usually laugh when nervous or embarrassed. (when I later recovered from the shock I was angry that nobody told him off. Not even my fiancee)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway MIL contacted my fianc\u00e9 and asked him if I still had time to find a new dress to my engagement party. SIL knew that MIL has seen the dress so she (mil) asked to see it). Apparently it was very revealing according to SIL and she wasn't sure if she wanted to come if I didn't change dress. ESPECIALLY when I loved the attention from her husband (because I laughed). I said no I won't change my dress, now my fiancee is sad that his sister doesn't want to attend. and both SIL and MIL think I'm an attention seeking AH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[this is the dress.
