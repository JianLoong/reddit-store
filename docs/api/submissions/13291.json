If he wanted his car detailed for his birthday gift and you hosed it down with the garden hose instead, should be be grateful?", "NTA. \nCleaning isn't a gift; he should really be picking up the slack anyways when you're ill.\nA professional clean is so different from a non-professional one.\nIt sounds like he did a bad job, to boot.", "NTA. Doing a poor job of cleaning the house (something you routinely are expected to do on your own) is not a thoughtful gift.\n\nIf he actually did a great job that may be different, but as it stands, you're going to have to clean up after his cleaning up. Which doesn't sound like a great gift to me.", "INFO: why is he already not cleaning regularly?", "NTA helping clean the house shouldn't be a birthday gift for your partner. It should be a constant part of day to day life together.  But doing a few chores that you usually do in order to benefit the space you both inhabit isn't a gift. I could see if he hired out a deep clean maybe. But really this is the equivalent of getting your wife a vacuum or washing machine for her birthday. I can see his thought process behind the gesture but you're valid for feeling that it kind of falls short. It's like if you offered to change the oil on the car or w.e. for his birthday. Nice I guess. But not really a thoughtful gift you can cherish.", "BIG NTA, nothing is worse than weaponized incompetence.  Then, it used as a gift would send me into an apocalyptic fit. Exspecially when I asked for it to be done professionally.", "NTA - Your gift is that he cleans the house he lives in? It sounds like he needs to help more regularly as someone who lives there. \n\nSorry but this is not a gift, this is him contributing like a grown up", "NTA. Husband pitching in on housework is an expectation, not a birthday gift.", "NTA. If he half assed cleaned the house as a birthday gift I\u2019d be upset too. The house got messy while you were sick, I think he saw this as a \u201cnice\u201d thing to do but not for a birthday gift. I get if he actually went into detail, scrubbed stuff down, and got to the nitty gritty but from what you\u2019ve told us it doesn\u2019t sound like it.", "NTA and I'm honestly shocked at how many people think *picking up a chore when your partner is sick* is a gift, and doing it sloppily is still thoughtful because it\u2019s harder for a sloppy person. You asked for a professional deep clean, not for weaponized incompetence disguised as a loving gesture.", "Get in quick with your response & be really, really clear. But kind. \n\nThis is not the time to be subtle. \n\n\u201cSorry, darling, I obviously wasn\u2019t clear before, maybe because I was ill. The gift would be an expensive PROFESSIONAL clean. I love that you are willing to (do the absolute bloody minimum - grrrr) given I have been so ill, but that would NOT be in any way a birthday present. That would be being a half-reasonable adult / partner / parent. I didn\u2019t mean to be unclear - but for the avoidance of doubt here is my Amazon wish list link again.\u201d", "NTA, did he even bother to make a coupon book for this? This is like someone saying \"I want a pair of size 8 sneakers that are white\" and they're given size 6 Crocs in white. Like, they're both white and are shoes, but that's about it.", "nta it was super thoughtful and i even think doing it himself if yall didnt have the funds was sweet too. but half assing like he did rlly means you got absolutely nothing out of it. its fair to be disappointed", "NTA. Seeing this kind of cleaning as a gift just means that it\u2019s seen as solely your responsibility to clean the house. Your job is to do the primary parenting. Everyone who lives in the house should be contributing (within reason) to cleaning it. You can be grateful and appreciative of the gesture while still hoping for a bit more recognition of your birthday.", "INFO: Does he not help with cleaning normally?", "NTA Didn\u2019t even read it before deciding. But then I read it and got annoyed at your husband. NTA.", "INFO: Did you only requested getting the house cleaned or asked for anything else? Did you mentioned to him you wanted it to be done professionaly or did you just keep that in your head?\n\nEdit: NTA cleaning is like cooking, while thoughtful it's more a necessity than showing you appreciate someone. You're sick so he should already do a bit more around the house for the time being, if not for that I'd think neither of you would be one.   \nYou can still ask him about one specific thing from your list you want like a book. In general if it comes to gifts it is often better to tell someone you want something specific instead of going \"hey here is a box just pick something you want\"", "NTA. For me, when my boyfriend \u201ccleans the house\u201d it really stresses me out because he genuinely does not know how to clean and I feel like I will just have to redo the cleaning with the added stress of hurting my boyfriends feelings. If he is not going to hire a professional then he needs to get a gift gift and stay away from the precious cleaning products!!", "NTA - He cleaned the house you both live in and called it a gift? What's for Christmas, he's gonna mow the grass or hoover the car? Sounds cheap to me, and like something he should have done anyway", "NTA - him doing housekeeping is part of expectations. Even if in your case he likely does little as your are a SAHM.\n\nHe should just get you a gift or meaningful activity. Not do normal, expected stuff around the house.", "NTA. What you want is a deep clean, where every last bit is done, and the reason this is a good gift is that it saves you from doing it yourself.\n\nWhat he's giving you is a corner-cutting quick clean that completely misses the reason you wanted it, as you'll have to redo it yourself to get everything he skipped.\n\n\nWhile you can appreciate the thought, you're NTA for finding the actual gift worthless.", "A general rule of thumb is that nothing household is ever considered a gift. Of course if you love baking and want a KitchenAid you may think that a great gift but trust me, don't fall into that trap as you're opening doors for other household items to be gifts and next time you're getting a Dyson!\n\nAnyway, NTA but saying a full house clean would be a gift was never a good plan.", "YTA\n\nNormally I'd have said NTA because...this isn't a gift. But you asked for it, specifically. He didn't pay for it professionally but he still gave you what you asked for. He deep cleaned the entire house, spent his time doing it for you because it's what you asked for. Expecting something else because he didn't follow the direction to the letter is crappy.", "Nta; why doesn\u2019t he clean the house properly anyway? This should just be standard not a gift to you.", "NTA it should be his priority too, especially since you were sick. \nAnd I\u2019m the only one thinking that a bit of a \u201echeap gift\u201c?", "Esh your husband should be more involved with cleaning already. You seem picky, and ungrateful.", "If you say your husband is not detail oriented, he probably knows this also. Which makes this gift even better, as this seems like it isn\u2019t going to be a cake walk. I\u2019m a little shocked at this post, you sound ungrateful. YTA.", "Soft YTA. You should appreciate the gesture.", "YTA. He tried to do something nice that you at least here say that you thought would be a great gift, meaning he paid attention to what you said and put into action. He can always go back and fix what he screwed up on.", "YTA.\n\nEspecially because of your point 2. \"On the face of it it is a thoughtful gesture.\"\n\nNo. It IS a thoughtful gesture. Super thoughtful. He took on board what you said and came up with an unconventional and sweet gift gesture. It doesn't become less thoughtful because he doesn't clean as well as a professional. In fact I'd it's especially thoughtful because you haven't been able to clean yourself recently.", "Yes. YATA.", "YTA YTA YTA. YOU ARE SO UNGRATEFUL", "Extremely soft YTA. It doesn\u2019t seem like your husband was trying to take the cheap way out and it feels like he put a lot of thought into it. I\u2019m sure he thought that you would really like him taking some things off your plate. \n\nPeople give bad gifts all the time, but this doesn\u2019t seem like it was from a lack of effort or care.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Even if he paid someone to professionally clean then it's not really a gift just for you as everyone benefits from it.\n\nI dunno how long yous have been married but isn't there something he could get to show how much he appreciates you.  I'm sure if you said your cleaning the house for his birthday he wouldn't be impressed.", "NTA. That sounds like a really half-assed gift.\nNot only because cleaning is his responsibility too so how is that a gift to you?? Like doing his damn job is a gift? But also because you can already predict he\u2019ll either half-ass it or come and annoy you every five minutes asking you how to do x, y, or z.
