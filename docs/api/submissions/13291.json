I could see if he hired out a deep clean maybe. But really this is the equivalent of getting your wife a vacuum or washing machine for her birthday. I can see his thought process behind the gesture but you're valid for feeling that it kind of falls short. It's like if you offered to change the oil on the car or w.e. for his birthday.

He needs to contribute to the upkeep of their space.", "I don't care how you want to sugar coat, white wash, or bend it around but the fact of the matter is he did something thoughtful and she was ungrateful.\n\nP.S.: sign of things to come", "What job is going to hire you in a day, let you work that day, then be happy you quit that day just because your husband has a cold or something? He can easily clean compared to having to interview, do paperwork for taxes, then work that one day, and then quit", "It's not really a double standard when you look at the actual context. OP's job is keeping the home and children. But to put that 100% on her is the double standard because his job comes with a start and end time while her's would be a 24/7 gig.", "Her husband doesn't work \"all day\". Shifts are 8 hours. He can help out during the rest of his day. It's HIS HOUSE too.", "It\u2019s not a luxury *in their family dynamic*  compared to the husband, not society.", "Yes statistically. And statistically women are more likely to be the stay at home parent. The division of responsibilities often ends up that way, completely voluntarily. Though yes it also ends up that way through a partner's unwillingness to contribute. We can't really know unless OP comments to clarify.", "We call that causation not correlation. You can make statistics look like anything you want to, that\u2019s the fun, and misleading, part about them. \n\nIf women are more likely to be SAHP than men, than they are also more likely to do more housework. I.e being more likely to be a SAHP causes them to do more housework, on average.\n\nWithout looking at the actual paper, those types of statistics tend to be misleading.", "I personally think, that both parents should contribute. That being that, I dislike the concept of SAHP. Both can reduce workhours and split time with children as well as the houswork. Then there is no discussion on who has the \"harder\" job. We have 2023, there is no need to stay at home for years because of children. The is daycare, kindergarden, schools, sports etc. In families where children are more and more without siblings, this is also not about giving the children away, no, they need contact to children their own age.\n\nSome parents (mainly women), however this cherry picking view on feminism.: They still want to stay at home with their children, like their mothers did. Foster around them, sometimes even too much. But of course the otherside of things, taking care of the household, is annoying. \n\nAnd to take that argument away: I never will never neglect the tough work, moms have had over the centuries. Staying at home, working round the clock and still get punched by drunk husband for whatever reason. Mad respect. But that was with 5-8 children, without washing machine, dish washer, dryer, vaccuum, garden and what not. Also often enough the in law parents lived at home as well and had to be taken care of, because of age. Nobody should have to do ALL of this.", "Who talks about spotless? And errands can be done on the way home by the working partner... But still the majority can be done by the person at home. Working 8 hours normally means at least 8:30 out of the house (lunch brake, can be used for those errands), plus the time one needs to work.\n\nAnd anyway. So many people cannot afford to stay at home in the first place. This is such a rich white bubble discussion. How do they manage? How do single parents manage? Of course people are different, but sometimes some perspective helps to have a different view on things.", "So the SAHM mother can do all the \"nice\" ( i know not everything is nice) bonding stuff, and father can work and clean the house? No. If my wife would choose the SAH approach my priorities would be the following\n\nwork (not really priority 1 of course, but kind of mandatory to go) > time with my children > time with my wife > doing necessary household stuff > doing unnecessary household stuff (things that can easily done less frequent)", "I just disagree that he did something thoughtful. I don't think it was thoughtful at all. He should've just gotten her what she wanted instead of taking it in his own hands. And disrespecting your partner's opinion is rude. I don't think she was ungrateful. He did not do what she asked. Why would she be happy about being ignored?", "Day jobs that pay cash, every town has them. But no, the expectation is he should double down on his efforts for her but she shouldn't have to do the same for him. Make all the excuses you want but it really is just a double standard.", "I apologized somewhere to someone already... I misread the part she did request Professional help", "right?! maintaining a spotless house is virtually impossible. does this person live on this planet?", "All I know is that historically men didn't contribute to the household, and it's only in the past \\~40 years or so that women have spoken up about it. Times are a-changin' and men need to help more to make the home more equitable.", "Look up \"weaponized incompetence\".", "Not a rich white problem at all. This is an issue a lot of people face. Where men work and women are expected to do everything else. \n\nThey both live in the house. So they should both care for the house.", "How do you ask for gifts? You're not 5 years old and sitting on Santa's lap at the mall. Be happy with what you got.", "No it really isn't. But you can believe what you want because I'm sure no one is going to convince you otherwise", "Otherwise, they\u2019d be paying for childcare. That is a HUGE financial contribution to the shared household. Someone did a study on it, and the value of unpaid labor that SAHMs provide is over $100,000 a year.", "I'm single so I do both.  The traditional female tasks take minimum 10 times the amount of time monthly than the traditional male tasks.  Hands down.", "You totally glossed over the point that the person you responded to made. The flaw is how you think about people. If you think it's reasonable to assume OP doesn't help based on statistics, it's just as reasonable to assume that she is responsible for the cleaning due to SAH partner statistics. In reality, neither is reasonable and you shouldn't make assumptions.", "You thing OP husband is doing that, to get out of the chore? Could be, but i doubt it. He offers this as a present, which makes no sense in the context of weaponized incompetence. For me there are rather 2 possibilities:\n\n1) Husband ist really bad at cleaning.\n\n2) Wife has high standards, husband can do no right. If husband would clean the house, an outsider would consider it proper cleaned\n\nOf course there is some room in between.\n\nFrom my personal experience No 2 is quite common.", "All your saying is that being a SAHM has more value than being a working full provider Dad. If it doesn't go both ways if the expectation is only one direction then it is a double standard.", "Same here, and I've been at home for half a year of parental leave doing that too.  \n\nThe amount of work depends on your lifestyle I suppose, if you live in an apartment most 'male jobs' dissappear. I was just saying that that I think judging him for leaving it all on his partner was unfair when he works full time and probably do those kinds of things. \n\nCleaning as a gift are one of the worst ideas I've ever heard thought. I'm not defending that one bit.", "Uh, no they both have value. But you don't stop being a parent just because you work. If your spouse is sick and unable to take care of the house and kids, you step up. That's called being a parent. If you don't want to have duties outside of work, be single and child free. Because guess what? You don't stop having responsibilities to your family just because you make a paycheck. That's life, not double standards", ">I mean, that\u2019s literally some peoples jobs, in many diff fields. \n\nLmao, are you joking?\n\nYou're seriously going to go \"You're being obtuse!\"... when bringing up jobs where you actually are watching TV, like a TV edittor?\n\nThen it's work again, not comparable to what we're talking about. A video edittor who sits and works for eight hours, and someone who watches TV for eight hours in their living room, are HUGELY different. You know that."]}
