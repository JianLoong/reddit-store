I could see if he hired out a deep clean maybe. But really this is the equivalent of getting your wife a vacuum or washing machine for her birthday. I can see his thought process behind the gesture but you're valid for feeling that it kind of falls short. It's like if you offered to change the oil on the car or w.e. for his birthday.

He\u2019s offering to do the cleaning as a special birthday present. \n\nIn marriage, it isn\u2019t 50/50. It\u2019s 100/100. Everyone has to give it their all. \n\nAlso: this is one specific situation. We aren\u2019t talking about \u201csome women.\u201d This is about one woman.", "Why are you using the word \"emancipation\" in this context?", "Some women want a partner what's a whole adult, and I don't like that.", "Fair enough. Regardless, though, I think OP\u2019s NTA.", "Of course that is normal in a healthy relationship. But OP writes, that he DID do the cleaning, it just was not up to her standard. Therefore I assume, that she does do all the cleaning by herself anyway, because he just cannot do it right. This is a stereotype I hear from a lot of different relationships.\n\nThe whole concepts of SATP is something I will never understand. Especially as doing this in the 1950s is not remotely comparable to 2020s. With all the electronic support, less children on average, and most of the times no elderly in-law parents to take care of on top, in only mostly comes down to perfectionism in most cases.\n\nOf course a house with children is messy and dirty. When one parent is ill, of course the other one it pickung up some slack. Coming home as the working partner complaining on the cleaniness would be a massive dick move of course.", "For hating that gift - yes I agree. It is a gift children give their parents, not a gift from one partner to the other - except maybe as a surplus. For days with a massive (I don't give a fuck, I use one of my vouchers) But even then i would have it as partner vouchers. Everyone gets 5 vouchers per year. Exempting for every chore on that day. Of course the other partner can veto it, hence sacrificing one voucher themselves.\n\nBut he is not necessarily the asshole for not doing the cleaning.", "On that last bit, I think we should agree to disagree. Like I said, every household is different. What works for you may not work for everyone else and vice versa."]}
