All my dogs over the years knew what \u201cNo\u201d meant. I\u2019m no wizard dog trainer, but I did manage to keep my dogs off lawns when the owners didn\u2019t want them there. It\u2019s just a matter of respect and consent.", "As soon as you see your dog preparing to squat you can get it to move. Its not cruel; its training. But if the dog poops somewhere it shouldn't, you pick it up. This guy wasn't picking it up.", "You people are so freaking entitled. You have no right to go on someone else's property with your dog and let your dog shit.", "I really don't care though. I don't respect property to the extent that I'm going to worry about a dog walking 3 feet into someone's lawn. As long as the poop is cleaned up then there is absolutely no harm being done to anyone's property, and that's all that actually matters.  Honestly I'd judge anyone who thinks that a homeowner keeping an animal from being on the very edge of their property is some all-important right that's worth standing up for \ud83d\ude44", "Wrong. Pay attention to your dog so you DON'T need to yank it away. Unless you are the type of dog owner that rarely takes your dog out so it desperately needs to defecate asap.", "Yanking a dog mid poop just confuses them and makes them think they\u2019re not allowed to poop at all. I hate when I accidentally interrupt my dog\u2019s poop when I call them in from the yard and don\u2019t realize they\u2019re pooping. It\u2019s not natural to expect any living thing not to poop. \n\nEven in the strictest human situations people are allowed to poop. Even inmates in max have a toilet in their cell.", "Why would yanking be necessary? The dog shouldn\u2019t have gotten onto the lawn in the first place\u2026", "Nowhere OP stated that he wasn't picking up. They were complaining about can't he read the sign.", "This is the comment I\u2019ve been looking for! We\u2019ve got foxes in our neighborhood that poop EVERYWHERE! The street, my driveway, everywhere. They drive me crazy but what can I do about it? Call their mama to come pick it up? Right\u2026", "Guys. Its simple. Just train your dog to walk right next to you at all times and not move ONCE off the less than 1 meter wide sidewalk. If you can\u2019t even do that what kind of dog owner are you ????? Worst dog owner clearly. Who cares if they can\u2019t sniff grass and only ever feel concrete under their feet", "To do what specifically? What command should\u2019ve been used here?", "Bro that's crazy \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I can at least sort of understand hating** on Dogs because they bark at lot, and cat owners tend to leave their cats outside and then they can kill local wildlife, but what on God's green earth is a pet bunny doing to tic u off lmao\n\nEdited for clarification", "The dog pee kills the grass. It's not weird to not want your lawn covered in dead brown patches.", "My husky is like this. I think it's an anxiety thing because she was rescued off the street as a puppy and she feels vulnerable when she poops. When she was a puppy, she'd hold her poop for the entirety of a 3-hour hike and then poop in the floor of my house because she felt safe there. \n\nFor that reason, I will never interrupt her mid-poop if she's outside. I don't care if she's pooping on the president's lawn and secret service is telling us to go. That would set us back months, lol.", "Because, why take the chance of aggravating someone when it can be avoided. Give crabby neighbors a wide berth.", "You shouldn't. \n\nShould I be able to park my car on your lawn?", "As if there aren't outdoor cats and raccoons and whatnot peeing on their grass, lol.", "Ugh \ud83d\ude29 never thought about the wheelchair bound\ud83d\ude22", "Very good point", "We have super obnoxious neighbours who have put up \"no pooping\" signs on their nature strip, it is the most entitled thing I've ever seen. \n\nMy dog is trained not to toilet on concrete because faeces and urine on a footpath in an Australian summer is not a vibe, but everything else is fair game. If you want to protect your grass from dogs (and cats), then spring for a fence.", "Was there a sign on the toilet saying I can't use it?", "But what if you were shitting while trespassing in someone random person's bathroom?", "Nothing you said here even addresses the question. Is the jogger an ax-hole ?", "My neighborhood is full of coyotes. Guarantee they are pooping and peeing on people\u2019s property at night. Never mind the birds that shit all over everything. We live in a world with animals.", "Given the amount of parents who change their babies on restaurant tables, and the other amount of disgusting things kids stick in their mouths regularly, I find this argument insanely stupid. \n\nIf you are this scared of animal poop I guess you never take your kids to public parks? Or into the woods? Or to a public restroom?", ">  but what on God's green earth is a pet bunny doing to tic u off lmao\n\nSomeone else is in a happier place in life than them with their pet bunny. That's the most likely outcome.", "You\u2019d be amazed at the reason there are few to no sidewalks in my area. How about \u201cto keep the riffraff out\u201d? The streets are narrow, hilly, and winding. It\u2019s all about the cars. Trying to ride a bicycle is taking your life in your hands. We have low overpasses on our highways which were also designed to keep out buses filled with \u201cundesirables\u201d from the city. Someone here will guess where I live.", "The mental gymnastics are astonishing on some people here. They trained it not to crap in the house, right? They can train it the same not to crap other places. You can actually even train it to crap in your own yard.", "Are you that much of a people pleaser in other areas of your life? I agree with panic_bread that if you have a lawn right next to a sidewalk then it's completely illogical to get uptight over dogs walking on it. I'd actually take it a step further and say it's immoral.", "I sang Baby Beluga to myself. And looked for patterns in the tile or followed color paths. I still remember the embarrassment coming out after singing when I realized everyone had heard me.\n\nI\u2019m still weird. Though I don\u2019t sing in the bathroom anymore. But I do look for patterns in tile!", "Fine I'll shit in your yard", "but that's what toilets are for?", "Don't threaten me with a good time.", "I\u2019ll shit in your toilet if you yank me off", "That makes me sad. My dog makes eye contact with me while pooping awkwardly across our yard every day, and I read that it\u2019s because he trusts me to take care of him and warn him of danger.", "I have some news for you, separate from dogs.\n\nYou have *a lot* of shit in your yard. Like, A LOT. Birds shit in your yard. Mice shit in your yard. Feral cats shit in your yard. Your neighbors \u201cindoor/outdoor\u201d cat shits in your yard. *Millions* of insects are shitting in your yard, right now! You\u2019ve likely had a fox, coyote or mountain lion shit in your yard. Maybe even a bear!\n\nAnd you know what, *none* of those are cleaning up after themselves. But you know who does clean up shit? Responsible dog owners that aren\u2019t willing to violently yank their family member around by their *throat*. \n\nBut none of that is going to change your opinion, because the internet doesn\u2019t change peoples opinions, we all just scream into the void.", "He has no poop sign, all those animals obey it obviously", "I am sure there is a sub for this.   I\u2019m just not looking\u2026.", "i\u2019m sorry\u2026 what? buddy.. pal\u2026 don\u2019t joke too hard about it or you\u2019ll end up with a fetish for real", "Happy Cake Day!!.... I'm well aware of random animal and insect poop ends up everywhere. I'm also well aware of the types of nastiness that can be found in poop, including dog poop. I'd rather have birds pooping in my yard than a dog with worms. I also have a dog, and other dogs' poop can spread diseases, so I'd like to keep the chances of another dog giving my dog something lower than it would be if all the dogs in the neighborhood are crapping in my yard. I think it's perfectly reasonable to want people to keep their possible diseased/carrier dogs from spreading their nastiness at the very least. Have a great day.", "Maybe people just don't want your dirty ass pets shitting on their private property", "You've clearly never taken a dog for a walk.", "I would rather a dog shit on my lawn than on my sidewalk. Much easier to clean up whereas sidewalks are not. And let\u2019s be real, no dog owner is going to rinse the sidewalk down so the likelihood of me stepping in shit is high even if it\u2019s just the leftover traces of it.", "Dog owners need to clean up the shit,  bottom line. I have a dog, I clean up his shit. Most dog owners in my neighborhood do not, unfortunately, and there are piles of dog shit everywhere. It is gonna happen, yeah, but it\u2019s the assholes who just leave it on the ground that make it into everyone else\u2019s problem.", "I\u2019d rather keep it outside too but it will attract the bears. Bears love trash. It\u2019s bylaw in most towns around here too.", "It's Reddit, we always talk in circles.  Wait, I am still on Reddit right?", "It's 2024. God has forsaken us.", "So you're... unaware of what can be found in the shit of birds, mice, and other rodents, then?", "Well, there goes my innocence for 2024", "Or maybe a blumpkin?", "maybe. Am I still on Reddit??", "Have you heard of squirrels? Possums? Raccoons? Rats?  Yes, rats are everywhere...even if you never see them.  Not to mention all the insect bits and whatever bacteria, fungus etc is in the soil.  There's shit and literal shit everywhere."]}
