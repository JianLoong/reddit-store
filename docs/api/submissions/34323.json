It\u2019s a minimal inconvenience to just not give your dog the opportunity to poo in someone\u2019s yard who is asking you not to.", "The signs are for the owners, not the dogs.", "I think allowing your dog on someone else's private property to take a shit is creepy. Yes.\n\nYou have a leash, use it.", "Its the piss that kills the lawn and leaves behind unsightly spots of dead grass.  The poop is also disgusting and not all of it is recovered.  I have kids that play on my lawn and for that reason I dont like dogs shitting on my grass.\n\nI spray dog repellant on the first 20 ft of lawn alongside the street and it almost always deters them.\n\n>literally wild animals that can and will poo in that yard without cleaning up after themselves.\n\nNot a good example.  Ill take a typical bird, squirrel, rabbit or other typical yard animal pooping in my lawn any day vs a dog that leaves behind human sized turds that smell worse than any of the aforementioned animals.", "I never said this particular dog owner. I meant others.\n\nAnd I never said OP wasn't a AH for saying something. He should've minded his own business. I've made a comment of my own expressing my opinion.", "> Sure if its a bystander by defintion.\n\nWhich is exactly what OP was.", "> Empathy has nothing to do with it\n\nWell, you're certainly right about that, because you have none.", "You don't have to believe me, I don't really care. I really don't think someone taking a dump is all that crazy, maybe it's because I tend to spend a lot of time in the woods lol. If they picked it up, I'd have a laugh and share the footage with friends. If they didn't I'd have some problems.", "Can people who don't own cars decide to sitnon your car hood, even though it's pretty harmless? Can people who don't own a smartphone can take it while you're not looking to play their favorite songs on youtube? Pretty harmless. But it's up to you if you're comfortable with how people use your property.", "Most of those animals in subdivisions do not leave poop the size of an All Bran eating human. Dogs can and do. . Even if the dog owner picks up the poop part of it stays intertwined in the grass blade to get on little kids shoes etc.My dogs filled our back yard with poop (that we picked up ) but we also did not USE our back yard because of that .If your neighbor does not want your dog in their yard keep the blankety blank dog out of their yard !", "Take your pick. I have PLENTY \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 warm AND cold", "Dog poop is completely different than rabbit/horse/goat etc. you\u2019re comparing herbivores to omnivores. And yes, it all has bacteria. But most parasites are species specific. So dog poop can carry parasites that can infect other dogs whereas deer and other wildlife do not.", "As someone with a microbiology degree, I can tell you that it doesn't all have the same bacteria in it.", "Dogs sniff around as they walk and I just realized that we don\u2019t know how far the dog went onto their property, which matters. If the dog went way in, then I get it, but if the dog did it\u2019s business at the edge of the property, then it\u2019s no big deal. \n\nHowever. The dog owner was a dick and shouldn\u2019t have had that reaction. So Op isn\u2019t the asshole on that front.", "Yes because dogs shit on command....good god, wtf am I even reading?\n\nYou obviously don't have a dog. If you are walking your dog and it crouches, anything you do will be pointless because the dog is going to shit. Sometimes it cannot be helped. All the signs in the world won't help. At least be a good person and pick it up afterwards.", "So dogs can be trained. Good to have a confirmation on that.", "What part of \u201cmain character\u201d makes you think weather control or some Disney-esque ability to control animals?\n\nAs the owner of the building I\u2019m sitting in rn, I have a lot of control over what happens up to the property line, and little control beyond it.", "Aren't you aware that homeowners will take measures to reduce the possibility of squirrels breaking into attics, birds nesting in eaves? The homeowner here doesn't want giant mounds of dog shit on his lawn and wants to reduce the chances of his lawn being shat on, so he put up the signs, figuring most dog walkers can read and not let their dog wander near that specific lawn. It's HIS property to do with as he wishes. Your weather comparison is asinine; nobody gives a shit if their house is rained on.", "Boy is that a reach. State/city rules are typically safety regs not personal enjoyment rules which is what we are talking about here so your strawman argument is just that. \n\nYou are not entitled access to someone else\u2019s private property and framing it as the property owner being selfish for setting boundaries on access to their property is showing you as the entitled one.", "100% agree", "If I deleted any comments, it would show on the thread that a comment was deleted.", "Sure, which I can do when I see people coming and we don't wanna hog the sidewalk. Many times, you cannot predict that your dog is about to shit.", "So say it isn\u2019t a neighbor? I\u2019m just walking my dog and don\u2019t notice the sign right away, my dog decides it\u2019s time to go and goes?", "Again if you put a sign like that in your yard, you have no concept of reality.", "Got it, you've got no concept of what constitutes creepy behavior. I was pretty sure when you said \"I'd just take a picture of the complete stranger\" but now I know for sure.\n\nKeep on being awkward as hell I guess.", "Eh my dogs pee in my yard all of the time and I don\u2019t seem to have issues with dead grass. \n\nGood for you for spraying your yard, if that\u2019s your solution I don\u2019t see an issue with it.\n\nYour kids are still playing in poo.", "Fair enough!", "Not by definition, OP took part in the scenario and thus is no longer a bystander.", "And you have non for property owners.  We dont maintain our yards and install landscaping all to make a convenient bathroom spot for dogs.  Dog owners should have a little respect and understand that not everyone is thrilled for your dog that way you are.", "No , but birds and cats can and will", ">it\u2019s up to you if you\u2019re comfortable with how people use your property\n\nExactly, which is why the homeowner in question is welcome to put up a fence.", "Parasites can transfer from rabbit/raccoon feces to dog. Raccoon can actually be very dangerous for a dog if consumed. I\u2019m constantly scoping out the yard for that. Making sure they\u2019ve not set up any dens under my barn and the other structures.", "Again, wait until the dog shits in your yard before you take him walking in the neighborhood. No problem", "Oh? Please tell me all about how you can control other people walking on, tossing things into, or allowing their animals to walk upon your yard. Any amount of control you believe yourself to have outside the walls of the house is just that, a belief. You can't actually stop the neighbors from walking their dogs.\n\nSure, if you felt really strongly about it you can put a fence up around the property (assuming you're allowed to do so by the HOA, and city), but that's still not control.\n\nThe point is that putting up a sign that says \"no pooping\" is stupid, and getting worked up about someone walking their dog is stupid.", "OP is talking about one yard with a sign, though.  I have exactly that same scenario on my daily dog walk.  At that one yard, I keep my dog on the sidewalk or the street.  Never had a problem.", "Then you say sorry my bad if you get called out. And clean up after your dog. \nYou don\u2019t double down and argue about it. You accept accountability.", "I guarantee the owners only put up the signs because they were tired of assholes letting their dogs shit in their yard on a daily basis.", "I hope I didn't sound rude. It wasn't my intention if so. Sometimes you've gotta pick the battles you want to fight and others you should chose to ignore.", "Are you intentionally trying to miss the point?", "> And you have non for property owners.\n\nI am a property owner.\n\n>We dont maintain our yards and install landscaping all to make a convenient bathroom spot for dogs.\n\nI have some really terrible news for you.  All sorts of animals shit all over your yard.  And they aren't polite enough to pick their shit up, unlike this dog's owner.", "In this case the owner of the house didn\u2019t call the person out though, OP was just running along and decided to play neighborhood cop.", "Nope you didn\u2019t sound rude. It\u2019s a valid point that folks are lazy and won\u2019t pick up after their dogs, pisses me off to no end. \n\nI agree about picking your battles as well, OP should just stick to running for fun and stop being the neighborhood Marshall.", "What point? You said bystander and OP is not one, he decided to be a decent person instead", "I dont care when typical \\*small\\* animals e.g. birds, squirrels, rabbits etc... go.  They belong to nobody and cannot be policed.  \n\nYour dog leaves human sized turds that stink way worse than the aforementioned.  You can police your dog.  I have a dog and police mine.  I walk her on a tight leash and prevent her from entering anyone's property.  I treat others that way I want to be treated and dont use someone else's lawn for my dog's purposes.", "It doesn\u2019t matter who was holding the dog owner accountable. Owner was still in the wrong and instead of accepting accountability, he chose to escalate in order to avoid it. \n\nHealthy communities require we hold each other accountable. So much of the disfunction in US society is due to our individualism at any cost attitude. It creates unnecessary conflict and violence. So just do the right thing and be considerate.", "> What point? You said bystander and OP is not one\n\nOP was a bystander.  He made a choice to stop being a bystander by inserting himself into a situation that he had no business inserting himself into.  He did not decide to become a decent person.  He decided to become a nosy busybody.  Hence my suggestion that bystanders should mind their business.", ">You can police your dog.\n\nAnd this guy did exactly that.", "Save the righteousness, OP is an AH for thinking he\u2019s the community police. If the person isn\u2019t bothering anyone and cleaning up the poop, OP should have just continued his run. He escalated first. I bet you are also one of the people who would yell at someone in a store for not wearing a mask huh?", ">did exactly that.\n\nRight.  The dog owner blatantly ignored the signs the property owner put up and let his dog crap on the lawn."]}
