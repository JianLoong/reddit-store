It's a criminal act. Taking a picture of someone else's bank card or credit card, and entering that information into your own apps to spend their money is something you get a criminal record and potentially go to jail for.

We cooperate and communicate to make sure our resources are going where they need to go before spending frivolously.

You should have at least asked.\n\nBarring that, you should have at the very least texted him and let him know what you did, and that you plan to replace the money asap. A bit of communication could have mitigated this whole ordeal.\n\nCalling you a thief and attacking your character like that is going overboard imo.

Communication with the other person is what you should be holding up as a virtue of marriage, not expectations that your partner should read your mind or just allow you to take what's his. It's his savings so clearly that's money he's put aside for both of your shared future presumably. And 120 dollars from a savings account for many people is a lot of money.

That's a very common catalyst for women to start feeling unsure about split finances and to want to renegotiate the arrangements.\n\nThis kind of feels like you were conducting a test to me. To see: how generous IS he? And to test the waters on combining finances a little more. \n\nOr maybe to lash out a bit because you don't think he'd have helped you out if you hadn't taken it. Do you think he would have said \"too bad, just don't go\" if you'd ask for some temporary coverage until your stolen card was replaced?\n\nBut you should have used your adult words to talk about that instead of sneaking into his wallet. And if you genuinely think he wouldn't have happily spotted you the money if had asked, you probably shouldn't be married to him, or be having kids with him.", "I don't understand why you didn't just...ask him for some money to cover you until your card came in? And told him you would put whatever you used back into his account? YTA", "Yta. I get You are married but you keep your finances separate. You went behind his back and used his card without asking. If you had at least asked this wouldn\u2019t be a problem.", "YTA.  You couldn\u2019t text him and give him a heads up?  You couldn\u2019t Venmo him the money right away?

That's how healthy relationships work. \n\nYou violated your husband's trust, committed a crime, and you're acting like it's no big deal just because you're married. Shame on you.", "YTA. What kind of relationship do you have that you couldn't of told him what happened with your bank card, and asked him for some money for the day? And don't you have some credit cards?", "YTA.

It\u2019s sneaky and a shitty thing to do.

I think YTA because you both established a boundary on sharing (or not sharing) money. You violated that boundary without any communication. It wasn\u2019t an emergency and you definitely had time to plan it out but not communicate your intentions? You could have told him, while you were capturing the image from his wallet, I need to use your card for my lunch today.", "Um you took a picture of his card????? This alone makes you an AH. That's enough for me to not trust you. Was it really hard for you to shoot him a text or something?", "YTA, you literally photographed someone's card and used it to steal from their account. wtf. Why wouldn't you just ask him?\n\nYou had already agreed to keeping separate accounts. That's not your money.\n\nAlso, huge red flag that you randomly said \"he has no trouble providing for me.\" Why would you bring this up? Why is it his obligation to provide for you when there are no kids and you're keeping your finances separate - the two are mutually exclusive. Do you have any trouble providing for him? Do you both work?", "YTA  Separate means separate.  And yes, you ask when you use his separate card to pay for your stuff and honestly wouldn't have been that difficult of a discussion.", "YTA, is it so hard to just ask? This sets a poor tone in the relationship, since it breaks the element of trust by you being deceitful.", "Yea hun on this one I would say YTA. I\u2019m with your hubby this is about principle and you definitely should\u2019ve just explained and asked/let him know this is what you were going to do.

I don't know why you didn't say something before.  \"Hey, I lost my debit card.  Can I borrow some money tonight and I'll pay you right back\" would have solved a lot of issues.  Do you not have each others PayPal/Venmo/Cash App/whatever info?   Have you borrowed from each other before?\n\nAgain, yes I think some of this is silly if you're married.

Even today, I had to pay for some car repairs and so I just sent my partner a quick text and said that I was using his card to pay for it. I know he wouldn't mind if I had told him afterwards, but it's just courtesy to give them a heads up beforehand.", "But would you flip and call your husband a thief the first time it happened? OP did the wrong thing not informing husband in advance, but his is an over the top response IMO. \n\nMy husband used my pay pal once without mentioning it and when I got the notification I freaked as I thought I got hacked. I expressed great annoyance to him, he apologized  and that was the end of it. Unless this is a recurring problem, calling your spouse a thief over a relatively minor transgression is nuts to me. ESH.", "But she hAsN'T sEeN hEr AuNt iN 2 YeArS!!", "Fair enough. That\u2019s actually a good point.", "That is not a good idea.  If your debit card # is stolen (as happens when one uses cards out and about) then your money is simply gone and you're done.  You can get things waved for a credit card....  I wouldn't accept a student into my group who didn't have a credit card, they must be 21st century capable.\n\nI totally agree that what she did was wrong...", "No, it's not weird.", "I find it exceedingly weird, I do not have a single friend, coworker or colleague that doesn't have a credit card.  1) It's dangerous to use a debit card for things like car rentals or internet purchases because if the number is stolen, the number is simply gone.  2) You don't build credit, thus making it very difficult to buy a house, or even get reasonable car loans, etc.", "25 years of being together / marriage here. No problems with joint accounts either. Both on the same page financially though, and it astounds me how many people marry without that.", "My ex and I are separated and still share a \u201cfamily account.\u201d We probably will continue to do so until the child we co-parent is 18. It makes EVERYTHING easier.", "So you do have a banking app? You don't need a physical card to send him the money from the app. Just to use the card.", "It doesn't matter? That does not give you the right to steal someone's information.", "You could have literally asked him. It sounds like he would have given you money. \n\nInstead, you broke his trust, good job. Yta.", "INFO: why did you just ask??? Why'd you do it the sneaky route??", "Go to the bank?", "More like Rachel**mess**, amirite", "This!!!!!! It's like she has her blinders on to purposefully ignore answering that simple question. It's obvious he wasn't upset about the amount but the outright dishonesty.", "That is quite a leap..i stand by my orginsl comments. How long have you been married ?", "Yes! People make mistakes. As long as they recognize the mistake and don't do it repeatedly there is no need to get nasty. No wonder there are so many failed relationship posts on here if the majority would react the way the husband did.", "As I said my husband and I share finances so no, netiher of us could steal money but we still discuss major purchases and  I would be upset if my husband went out to dinner and spent over $100 *and* took money from an account that was earmarked for something else, with no discussion. Somehow my husband and I manage to just discuss these things beforehand tho so honestly it's a situation that has never come up in over 13 years together.\n\nNow, in a hypothetical scenario where my husband and I have separate finances and my husband took over $100 out of my account with no discussion? Yeah I would probably consider that to be theft. Especially because OP makes no mention of paying him back so she seems to just think that she can help herself to his money whenever she feels like it without consequence.  OP agreed to separate finances, then  suddenly decided that she was above the rules. Rules for thee and not for me is not a healthy way to behave in a marriage.  OP had time to: get his wallet, take his card out, take pictures of the card, put the card back in the wallet, and upload the pictures to Uber. If she had time to do all those steps she also had time to just talk to her husband and ask him.", "That\u2019s your opinion on credit cards, I personally do not need one. I can go to the bank, I have money on Revolut that I can use if my bank card is gone. I think there\u2019s other ways without needing a credit card. Too many people get themselves into debt.\n\nHowever I am moving from the point which we both agree on.", "we own our house, it hasn't negatively impacted us at all. if my debit card number was stolen and I saw suspicious activity in my banking app I'd just cancel the card. maybe it's a cultural thing", "People make mistakes. As long as they recognize the mistake and don't do it repeatedly there is no need to get nasty. I've been with my husband 20 years. I don't think most people on this sub will be able to sustain a relationship that long if they make a mountain out of every little mistake.", "I don't think you understand what they are saying. If your card # is stolen and thrives spent $1000 on your debit card then your money is gone, possibly forever. However, if they spent $1000 with a credit card then its actually the credit card company's money that's gone, so the credit card company can reverse the charges so you don't loss anything. Its great that you're avoid debt, but that's why is not a bad idea to have a credit card that you pay off every month, particularly if there is chance your card number could be skimmed or stolen.", "I can agree, I'm 28, never had a credit card and I don't really want one, it's too easy to get yourself into debt with those it you're not careful, plus most bank apps now have a feature where if you lose your debit card then you can disable it.\n\nI know my MIL has one but its strictly emergencies only ie if she needs to do a food shop or pay a bill and she's a bit short of money."]}
