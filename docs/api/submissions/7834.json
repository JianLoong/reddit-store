It's a criminal act. Taking a picture of someone else's bank card or credit card, and entering that information into your own apps to spend their money is something you get a criminal record and potentially go to jail for.

We cooperate and communicate to make sure our resources are going where they need to go before spending frivolously.

You should have at least asked.\n\nBarring that, you should have at the very least texted him and let him know what you did, and that you plan to replace the money asap. A bit of communication could have mitigated this whole ordeal.\n\nCalling you a thief and attacking your character like that is going overboard imo.

Communication with the other person is what you should be holding up as a virtue of marriage, not expectations that your partner should read your mind or just allow you to take what's his. It's his savings so clearly that's money he's put aside for both of your shared future presumably. And 120 dollars from a savings account for many people is a lot of money.

That's a very common catalyst for women to start feeling unsure about split finances and to want to renegotiate the arrangements.\n\nThis kind of feels like you were conducting a test to me. To see: how generous IS he? And to test the waters on combining finances a little more. \n\nOr maybe to lash out a bit because you don't think he'd have helped you out if you hadn't taken it. Do you think he would have said \"too bad, just don't go\" if you'd ask for some temporary coverage until your stolen card was replaced?\n\nBut you should have used your adult words to talk about that instead of sneaking into his wallet. And if you genuinely think he wouldn't have happily spotted you the money if had asked, you probably shouldn't be married to him, or be having kids with him.", "I don't understand why you didn't just...ask him for some money to cover you until your card came in? And told him you would put whatever you used back into his account? YTA", "Yta. I get You are married but you keep your finances separate. You went behind his back and used his card without asking. If you had at least asked this wouldn\u2019t be a problem.", "YTA.  You couldn\u2019t text him and give him a heads up?  You couldn\u2019t Venmo him the money right away?

That's how healthy relationships work. \n\nYou violated your husband's trust, committed a crime, and you're acting like it's no big deal just because you're married. Shame on you.", "YTA. What kind of relationship do you have that you couldn't of told him what happened with your bank card, and asked him for some money for the day? And don't you have some credit cards?", "YTA.

It\u2019s sneaky and a shitty thing to do.

I think YTA because you both established a boundary on sharing (or not sharing) money. You violated that boundary without any communication. It wasn\u2019t an emergency and you definitely had time to plan it out but not communicate your intentions? You could have told him, while you were capturing the image from his wallet, I need to use your card for my lunch today.", "Um you took a picture of his card????? This alone makes you an AH. That's enough for me to not trust you. Was it really hard for you to shoot him a text or something?", "YTA, you literally photographed someone's card and used it to steal from their account. wtf. Why wouldn't you just ask him?\n\nYou had already agreed to keeping separate accounts. That's not your money.\n\nAlso, huge red flag that you randomly said \"he has no trouble providing for me.\" Why would you bring this up? Why is it his obligation to provide for you when there are no kids and you're keeping your finances separate - the two are mutually exclusive. Do you have any trouble providing for him? Do you both work?", "YTA  Separate means separate.  And yes, you ask when you use his separate card to pay for your stuff and honestly wouldn't have been that difficult of a discussion.", "YTA, is it so hard to just ask? This sets a poor tone in the relationship, since it breaks the element of trust by you being deceitful.", "Yea hun on this one I would say YTA. I\u2019m with your hubby this is about principle and you definitely should\u2019ve just explained and asked/let him know this is what you were going to do.

I don't know why you didn't say something before.  \"Hey, I lost my debit card.  Can I borrow some money tonight and I'll pay you right back\" would have solved a lot of issues.  Do you not have each others PayPal/Venmo/Cash App/whatever info?   Have you borrowed from each other before?\n\nAgain, yes I think some of this is silly if you're married.

It is about the disrespect and sense of entitlement to something that wasn\u2019t yours for something that wasn\u2019t an emergency and you had plenty of time to communicate", "I think the scale is expanded because finances are clearly a troublesome subject to some degree.  It\u2019s not like it was a completely out of left field problem.", "I agree that was a shady move, I didn't mean to minimize those other things, I could have worded my comment better. \n\nI think they need to have a big important talk and establish these sort of boundaries before they pull the plug, BUT... only they know their own relationship best. Certainly not all of us.", "It depends on the family. In a lot of families $120  could mean the difference between whether or not you can pay your  groceries, medication, rent, utilities, etc for the month.  \n\n\nAlso I don't think it's (just?) the amount but the breach of trust. If OP had simply asked he may very well have been fine with it.", "I wouldn't call her a thief, but the way this was done is concerning.  She went into is wallet, took a picture of his card with her phone, then put it back into his wallet.   If she had access to his wallet he was almost certainly there, she could have talked to him, she took a picture on her phone that she could have used to call or text him if he wasn't.  It seems very obvious that not only did OP not discuss it with him, she purposely tried to do it discreetly hoping he wouldn't notice.  That is concerning.", "Your husband already had your permission to use it though, right?\n\nThis OP had never had that expectation.\n\nAnd I would ask even with standing permission just to make sure!! It takes ten seconds.", "oh yeah I get the purpose of them, and I know we've been privileged as fuck in having good jobs and always being able to pay rent and that kind of thing to prove that we are ~financially responsible~. it's just the first time I've heard not having one as *weird* haha", "I make a considerable amount more than my wife and we keep all of our finances combined.  Whenever we go to a restaurant and the server gives us the bill I always make a point to slide it over to her and say \u201cThanks for the dinner Sugar Mama.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s even better if they hand it directly to me because then I say, \u201cOh no, she pays for everything,\u201d and pass it to her. It\u2019s lame and corny but I always get a chuckle out of it while she rolls her eyes.", "My parents were pre-cana counselors for years and they told me that never encountered an engaged couple that had really gotten into the financial discussion before my parents brought it up as the single most important thing to agree on after having kids. It was not even a thought. I found that baffling when I was as young as 10 years old - finances are what marriage was created for and one of the main reasons it exists at all, you need to be compatible about philosophies and goals and priorities before signing a very enforceable contract and saying the vows that go with it. \n\n\"Love will conquer all\" is a shitty financial and marital strategy, but a common one.", "Not that I know of", "Yeah this is what I want to know, too. OP knew from the day before that their card was missing and had it deactivated and made an effort to get his CC info without his consent: got his wallet, took out the card, photographed it, uploaded it to the app, and put the card back all without asking or even telling him   \n\n\nThis wasn't an emergency like  she had already ate dinner and the restaurant and only realized when she went to pay that her card was missing.  This wasn't  a momentary lapse of judgement or an impulse buy without thinking.. This was planned in advance. Why not just ask?", "I think it\u2019s Rache I\u2019m Ass \n\nlol", "I\u2019m basically wondering if the big important talk ALREADY happened, and stealing the card is the response to it rather than the cause of it.  As I said elsewhere, the fact that the husband DIDN\u2019T immediately cancel the card seems like it means he had reason to suspect she took it, which says concerning things.", "If she\u2019s borrowing rent money that\u2019s a completely different issue but that\u2019s just strawmanning at this point. From what we know for a fact, they\u2019re in a 10 year relationship, and it was from her husbands savings. I\u2019m not saying the wife is in the right to do what she did, all I\u2019m saying is this is such a trivial matter for a dual-income household with no children, if this is a persisting problem I can understand, but one time issues like this shouldn\u2019t cause friction in your relationship of 10 years, but that\u2019s just me.", "It's a forgivable mistake, but I honestly completely agree with the husbands reaction. I grew up upper middle class in a small town where most people are regular middle class or poor, which basically meant most of the kids that tried to befriend me ended up just trying to manipulate me into buying things for them, and then flipping out on me when I wouldn't do it. So I already know if this happened to me, I'd be extremely pissed off due to all the times my trust was broken in the past due to money. \n\nJust to clarify, I didn't actually have any money of my own as a kid anyways lol. I'm very generous with my money as an adult because I learned to be careful financially early in life, which means I got plenty of money left over after every paycheck that I don't need to spend. Which is another reason I'd be really pissed off if someone I knew very well and cared about stole some money from me.\n\nThere's also the fact that she literally had to grab his card behind his back and take a picture of it, which implies they have an agreement to keep their money separate. I wouldn't react like the husband did if I had a joint bank account with my wife or gf, or if I had given her my debit card number myself in the past and told her to just make sure to only use it for cheap transactions, and to talk to me if she needs something expensive. The fact that she's 30, stole her husbands debit card info, and used it without his consent, AND doesn't see what the big deal is, is honestly a gigantic character flaw. If I was the husband, it'd honestly be real hard to move past this once she tried to argue back and act like it was no big deal. I've dealt with enough people like this to know that if I forgive them, there's a very high chance they'll do something much worse later on because they think they can get away with it.", "I witnessed a few marriages go wrong because of a difference in approach.  I also had very good finance teaching from grandparents which helped, but yes, too many people get married before they are comfortable enough to even discuss finances.", "Yeah, you might be on to something there. \n\nIf that's the case, they got major issues.", "The issue isn't how he responds tho, it's does she get why this was problematic? \nNot getting that is a different and bigger problem. \n\nYou would say \"you're right honey, I should have asked first and made sure you knew.\" \n\n(It wasn't an emergency, it was a hassle.)\n\nI dunno, I ask before running the card my partner KNOWS is on record for things (utilities, etc) just to make sure the timing of the charge is okay, and it doesn't mess up something I don't know about. Like... Just confirm that it's okay in this minute, or an FYI about what the charges you might see are.\n\nI *would* assume it's okay in an actual emergency, but... this isn't that.", "But OP doesn't even acknowledge it was a mistake, doesn't say she aplogized for her error in judgement, doesn't mention any intention to pay him back or otherwise give any indication  at all that she recognizes that what she did wrong or that she intends to make it right.   \n\n\n FFS even my children (and most children I imagine) know not to take things that aren't theirs, how does OP, an entire ass adult, not grasp something that elementary aged children understand?", "Yeah, my bank reimburses for fraudulent payments if your card is stolen.\n\nI know people have cards for emergencies and if that works for you that\u2019s great, I just don\u2019t want to get myself into debt again.", "Sounds like we both got lucky with our elders! \n\nYeah, I've seen some otherwise good marriages crumble because their financial priorities were simply too mismatched for the long haul and it bled into other areas, the resentment and annoyance. It's sad. I wish we told people, \"You're not ready to marry if not ready for the money talk,\" the same way we push, \"If you can't discuss sex with a partner, you're not ready to have it.\"", "Yea it works for my MIL but then again she's an accountant/bookkeeper for a small company so she knows what she's doing and she's smart with stuff like that. Me, I'd probably be in debt so yea I'm definitely not getting one.\n\nCredit cards are all fun and games until you have to pay back what you spent."]}
