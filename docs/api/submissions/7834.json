It's a criminal act. Taking a picture of someone else's bank card or credit card, and entering that information into your own apps to spend their money is something you get a criminal record and potentially go to jail for.

We cooperate and communicate to make sure our resources are going where they need to go before spending frivolously.

You should have at least asked.\n\nBarring that, you should have at the very least texted him and let him know what you did, and that you plan to replace the money asap. A bit of communication could have mitigated this whole ordeal.\n\nCalling you a thief and attacking your character like that is going overboard imo.

Communication with the other person is what you should be holding up as a virtue of marriage, not expectations that your partner should read your mind or just allow you to take what's his. It's his savings so clearly that's money he's put aside for both of your shared future presumably. And 120 dollars from a savings account for many people is a lot of money.

That's a very common catalyst for women to start feeling unsure about split finances and to want to renegotiate the arrangements.\n\nThis kind of feels like you were conducting a test to me. To see: how generous IS he? And to test the waters on combining finances a little more. \n\nOr maybe to lash out a bit because you don't think he'd have helped you out if you hadn't taken it. Do you think he would have said \"too bad, just don't go\" if you'd ask for some temporary coverage until your stolen card was replaced?\n\nBut you should have used your adult words to talk about that instead of sneaking into his wallet. And if you genuinely think he wouldn't have happily spotted you the money if had asked, you probably shouldn't be married to him, or be having kids with him.", "I don't understand why you didn't just...ask him for some money to cover you until your card came in? And told him you would put whatever you used back into his account? YTA", "Yta. I get You are married but you keep your finances separate. You went behind his back and used his card without asking. If you had at least asked this wouldn\u2019t be a problem.", "YTA.  You couldn\u2019t text him and give him a heads up?  You couldn\u2019t Venmo him the money right away?

They have always talked to each other before one of them takes the debit or credit cards AND they make every effort to disclose purchases of more than $25. They don't go behind each other's backs or steal from each other. That's how healthy relationships work. \n\nYou violated your husband's trust, committed a crime, and you're acting like it's no big deal just because you're married. Shame on you.", "YTA. What kind of relationship do you have that you couldn't of told him what happened with your bank card, and asked him for some money for the day? And don't you have some credit cards?", "YTA. The amount DOES NOT MATTER. You being married to him DOES NOT MATTER. YOU went BEHIND HIS BACK and took his credit card info without saying a damn word. On top of that you two agreed on SEPERATE FINANCES.", "YTA  he's disappointed because he TRUSTED you and you STOLE from him.  Why didn't you call or text and explain about your alledged \"lost\" card  and ASK him if you could use his card.  How/when did you get a pic of his card on your phone--that on it's own sounds pretty sketchy and combined with not spending a few seconds to ASK him if you could use it is a bit of a red flag that you're leaving out some important details.", "Well, I'm going to have to go with YTA because you took a picture of his card to take the money? Why were you so shady? I don't see why you wouldn't just ask and explain that you could pay him back when you get your new card.", "Yeah, YTA for taking your husband\u2019s money without even talking to him about it. It\u2019s sneaky and a shitty thing to do. Sounds like he didn\u2019t even blow up, just said he\u2019s hurt and disappointed which is totally valid and a much kinder response than I would have given.", "YTA, why didn't you just ask him?", "As a shared finance partner. I think YTA because you both established a boundary on sharing (or not sharing) money. You violated that boundary without any communication. It wasn\u2019t an emergency and you definitely had time to plan it out but not communicate your intentions? You could have told him, while you were capturing the image from his wallet, I need to use your card for my lunch today.", "Um you took a picture of his card????? This alone makes you an AH. That's enough for me to not trust you. Was it really hard for you to shoot him a text or something?", "YTA, you literally photographed someone's card and used it to steal from their account. wtf. Why wouldn't you just ask him?\n\nYou had already agreed to keeping separate accounts. That's not your money.\n\nAlso, huge red flag that you randomly said \"he has no trouble providing for me.\" Why would you bring this up? Why is it his obligation to provide for you when there are no kids and you're keeping your finances separate - the two are mutually exclusive. Do you have any trouble providing for him? Do you both work?", "YTA  Separate means separate.  And yes, you ask when you use his separate card to pay for your stuff and honestly wouldn't have been that difficult of a discussion.", "YTA, is it so hard to just ask? This sets a poor tone in the relationship, since it breaks the element of trust by you being deceitful.", "Yea hun on this one I would say YTA. I\u2019m with your hubby this is about principle and you definitely should\u2019ve just explained and asked/let him know this is what you were going to do. Sounds like he\u2019s hurt from the sneaking and deception and not just being upfront with the fact that you spent money out of his account. It is indeed his account and his money. So \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f YTA for this one. You needed to talk to him not just take liberty with his money.  I mean you took a pic of his information and saved. I\u2019m just lost why you couldn\u2019t talk to him before spending his money that way. Again it\u2019s his money in his account and you both agreed to keep your finances separate. And until you both open a joint account that your both putting your money into together, his money is his and yours is yours unless you\u2019re talking about hey hun had to shut my debit card down, can you help/do you mind if I use your card. I just don\u2019t know why that wasn\u2019t your first step rather than going the sneak route. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t already try to make amends, pay him back the money if you can.", "YTA. I don\u2019t understand separate finances but this is the choice you made. You can\u2019t just not tell him what you\u2019re doing. It\u2019s not about the money it\u2019s that you changed the system without telling him. I doubt he\u2019d have cared if you\u2019d just told him ahead of time so he wasn\u2019t ambushed.", "YTA.\n\nI've never taken money from my wife of 20+ years or her from I without one of us saying it to the other.

I thought marriage was the next legal step in a relationship that also coincides with joint financials, but that's just me.\n\nYTA for the record, as it seems all of this was and had already been established for quite some time. Communication is key and you have just set back that trust a bit. I would apologize and return the money.\n\nAlso, if kids are in yalls future. You REALLY got to get the financial part figured out. Children are crazy expensive between the hospital, dentist, doctors visits, food, formula, etc. you guys gonna split the cost? Lots to unpack there. \n\nBest of luck", "YTA for doing it behind his back.. do you not know how to communicate?!", "This doesn\u2019t sound like a marriage. \n\nI think it would be insane to be with someone who\u2019s going to count every penny and can\u2019t even help in an emergency.", "NAH. Just seems like some poor communication skills. I understand how he feels like you took from him but you\u2019re also married and it wasn\u2019t like you\u2019ve been embezzling money from his accounts. \n\nA simple text or conversation would\u2019ve prevented this.", "Unless there's more details you're not telling. NTA.  your husband should've given you the chance to pay him back.  he sounds like a prick.  i'd be questioning my marriage if i was in your position.  calling you a thief, if he was being sincere is pretty terrible, and shouldn't be done lightly,  if you had done this and got your card back and never paid him back, yea he'd have a point but now you don't have a chance to pay him back unprompted.  he's seriously ruined the situation in a way he shouldn't have.\n\n[miss daisy is the asshole here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V2gt6bAYxM)", "nta but definitely should questions yourself about your relationship, you should have been able to tell him you need a loan for a couple of days... have you ever asked him for a loan and he didn't do it?", "Why so much divide in your relationship?

You two should be a team and it's not *your money* and *his money* but *our money*.  I do think it's silly when couples borrow money from each other.  However...\n\nIf you're going to do separate finances then do separate finances.  You took his money without asking.  Not cool.  I don't know why you didn't say something before.  \"Hey, I lost my debit card.  Can I borrow some money tonight and I'll pay you right back\" would have solved a lot of issues.  Do you not have each others PayPal/Venmo/Cash App/whatever info?   Have you borrowed from each other before?\n\nAgain, yes I think some of this is silly if you're married.  But ultimately you took money without asking and what's worse is he had to notice it was gone before you said anything.  As silly as it might be to think you shouldn't *have to*  ask the other point of view is that the one person he *shouldn't expect* to take his debit card info is his wife.", "And now she broke her husband\u2019s trust.

Does he belittle you for more than this incident or is this the only time that type of language has been used?

We recalculate our budget every year, adjust our joint contribution percentage every raise, and keep half of our personal bonuses and put the other half into our joint savings. \n\nThis gives us each around 5% of our incomes to hold in personal savings for a rainy day where we want to help a friend or family without having to take it out of our joint expenses, surprise spending for each other, or unbudgeted gifts for our family, and we never have fights about money because as long as our joint account is moving as it should, what we do with our personal accounts are completely up to us.", "Are you the husband?", "Oh get out of here with that nonsense. \n\nOP is an AH for taking money without asking, but divorce?
