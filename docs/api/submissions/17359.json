The tougher questions really are when the \"abuser\" also took a role of caretaker in their final years, making it less strange that they may have received compensation.", "It really depends on the location - someone contesting something and having a legally valid claim to a portion of an estate would definitely make a lengthy probate process likely.  Guilt isn't assumed the burden is just shifted if you meet some initial requirements . What those requirements are differ in every state. So it's not automatic usually (though there are many jurisdictions that will consider certain types of transfers suspicious per se and outlaw them or require you to show they're appropriate to let it stand - issues involving caregivers is a big one here) and it's not that guilt is assumed. And often something like a plausible affidavit by the person that received the gift just outlining how they came to possess the item is sufficient. So like we were close she was at my wedding, we spent a lot of  time together, she raised me, she wanted me to wear this for my wedding and cherish it - op signing doc outlining those points might be enough. If op can add that grandma was interacting with others that day and was competent or she was able to make a speech or get to and from the location with minimal help - any detail like that would be enough to meet the burden in pretty much every situation.", "Yup I'm pretty much every single jurisdiction that has these burden shifting laws in place it would be sufficient to overcome a challenge in this regard.", "> None of that changes the very core principle you stated OP has to prove in court that she didn't steal the necklace and it wasn't part of the estate.\n\nIn my original comment I said:\n\n> Otherwise, **if** *it's mentioned in the will* **and** *the family has evidence of the grandmother owning the jewelry*, it would go back to the estate.\n\nI should have written \"could\" go back to the estate but it was late, but basically if the family has evidence that the necklace belonged to the estate, and OP has no evidence that it was a gift, they will likely lose the necklace. It won't take much evidence for OP to win the case, and it would be insane to go to court for a $600 necklace, but I've seen people do some petty shit to get back at someone.", "It's very rare that it's independently investigated though. Someone who has potentially colorable claim or in some places any family member or both  has to initiate the probate process usually. Or the executor has some ability to. There are ways in which it's triggered automatically like when someone dies without a will or there are competing wills or concerns about the validity or where whether property included and bequeathed actually belonged to the deceased. \n\nA lot of what you're saying would absolutely though go to whether a challenge would be thrown out or allowed to continue and is super relevant for burden shifting analyses  \n\nI would actually say the abuser as caretaker situation is generally the easier one to deal with - solely because many places have recognized the thorny issues you laid out and made outright prohibitions and limits on what caretakers may receive. When someone's a caretaker as well a lot of required level of proof isn't as high to meet because there's an understanding of how someone in that role had an outsized level of power and control potentially over the elderly person so a court is going to consider something that's borderline - less reasonable for a caretaker than non caretaker", "Right I'll bow out here because you've made the same incorrect point a third time as justification. \n\nEven IF those things were true, OP still doesn't have to prove anything, as the defendant. The litigant has to prove it. \n\nUntil a claim is made in court, OP has nothing to prove, end of."]}
