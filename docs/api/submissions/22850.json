We have been married for five years now.\n\nI work in a job where every morning I have different tools and items to prepare. On some days I'll be working at an office building, other days I'll be in a meeting, and occasionally I'll be working at someone's house. Each job requires different tools, each day requires different preparations to go smoothly. \n\nMy wife has a very bad habit of following me around with miscellaneous items, chosen haphazardly, asking if I need them that day or not. She seems to think that she's helping me, but she only distracts me and has caused me to forget things I actually did need at times. The issue is she won't do it once or twice; she'll rapid-fire out ideas, and when I thank her but tell her I don't need any help, she just goes \"Yeah yeah yeah, but how about this?\" as she holds up a new item.\n\nI've tried sitting her down and explaining to her that she's not helping me, but she keeps doing it. \n\nThe low point came last week when she got really stuck on a carton of yogurt I had bought. She noticed the expiration date was coming up (in four days) and asked when I was going to eat it. I said later. Then she asked if I wanted it for lunch. I said yogurt that had been sitting in my hot car for hours wasn't an appetizing lunch idea, which encouraged her to start Googling how long yogurt can sit out for. This allowed me to get the rest of my belongings and head out.\n\nAs I pulled out of the driveway my wife came out the front door in her pajamas and started trying to chase me down on foot, shouting about the yogurt. I waved and left.\n\nThat was my breaking point. After work I went shopping and got myself a cheap pair of noise canceling earbuds. From the next morning, I put them in, played some white noise (I'm not a big music guy), and went about my business. My wife kept trying to get my attention by waving her hand in front of my face, as she held miscellaneous items, but it was a lot easier than normal. I've also found that sending her on a little mission to get something will help a lot and wish I had thought of it sooner.\n\nLast night she sat me down and got really angry for ignoring her in the morning. I asked what I was supposed to do, to which she responded \"You're supposed to listen to your wife.\" \n\nDid I go too far for taking this step?", "created_utc": 1689990357, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1566rfb/aita_for_buying_noise_canceling_earbuds_to_tune/", "score": 509, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
