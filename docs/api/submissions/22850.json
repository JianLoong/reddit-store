We have been married for five years now.\n\nI work in a job where every morning I have different tools and items to prepare. On some days I'll be working at an office building, other days I'll be in a meeting, and occasionally I'll be working at someone's house. Each job requires different tools, each day requires different preparations to go smoothly. \n\nMy wife has a very bad habit of following me around with miscellaneous items, chosen haphazardly, asking if I need them that day or not. She seems to think that she's helping me, but she only distracts me and has caused me to forget things I actually did need at times. The issue is she won't do it once or twice; she'll rapid-fire out ideas, and when I thank her but tell her I don't need any help, she just goes \"Yeah yeah yeah, but how about this?\" as she holds up a new item.\n\nI've tried sitting her down and explaining to her that she's not helping me, but she keeps doing it. \n\nThe low point came last week when she got really stuck on a carton of yogurt I had bought. She noticed the expiration date was coming up (in four days) and asked when I was going to eat it. I said later. Then she asked if I wanted it for lunch. I said yogurt that had been sitting in my hot car for hours wasn't an appetizing lunch idea, which encouraged her to start Googling how long yogurt can sit out for. This allowed me to get the rest of my belongings and head out.\n\nAs I pulled out of the driveway my wife came out the front door in her pajamas and started trying to chase me down on foot, shouting about the yogurt. I waved and left.\n\nThat was my breaking point. After work I went shopping and got myself a cheap pair of noise canceling earbuds. From the next morning, I put them in, played some white noise (I'm not a big music guy), and went about my business. My wife kept trying to get my attention by waving her hand in front of my face, as she held miscellaneous items, but it was a lot easier than normal. I've also found that sending her on a little mission to get something will help a lot and wish I had thought of it sooner.\n\nLast night she sat me down and got really angry for ignoring her in the morning. I asked what I was supposed to do, to which she responded \"You're supposed to listen to your wife.\" \n\nDid I go too far for taking this step?", "created_utc": 1689990357, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1566rfb/aita_for_buying_noise_canceling_earbuds_to_tune/", "score": 158, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You may need to take a more full-frontal approach: \n\n\u201cListen, I love you very much, but you\u2018re driving me bonkers in the morning. When I\u2019m getting ready for work, it\u2018s like my pre-game; I\u2019m trying to get my head in the right space.

Please let me concentrate.\u201d Interrupts again, repeat statement. Interrupts a third time, let her see you set a timer on your phone upon which you tell her to go to another room until the timer goes off. \n\nPersonally, I think the noise canceling is rude, but I wouldn\u2019t think it was rude if you\u2019d already tried 2x that morning to get her to hear you.

That you need absolute focus to run down your list and check it twice. Pack up all your tools and gear and have it all waiting by the door for the next day. \n\nThen enjoy a sane and normal breakfast where you, an adult, are able to carry on a healthy conversation with your life partner. Then, you pick up your items, kiss her goodbye/say love ya, and tell her to have a wonderful day. I can\u2019t imagine you\u2019d be forgetful if you just handled this task in advance. Stop blaming her for your lack of preparation. \n\nAlso, be real dude\u2026 if she put in ear buds and acted like a passive aggressive teenager when you wanted to converse\u2026 you\u2019d feel like she doesn\u2019t care what you have to say.
