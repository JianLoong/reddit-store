We have been married for five years now.\n\nI work in a job where every morning I have different tools and items to prepare. On some days I'll be working at an office building, other days I'll be in a meeting, and occasionally I'll be working at someone's house. Each job requires different tools, each day requires different preparations to go smoothly. \n\nMy wife has a very bad habit of following me around with miscellaneous items, chosen haphazardly, asking if I need them that day or not. She seems to think that she's helping me, but she only distracts me and has caused me to forget things I actually did need at times. The issue is she won't do it once or twice; she'll rapid-fire out ideas, and when I thank her but tell her I don't need any help, she just goes \"Yeah yeah yeah, but how about this?\" as she holds up a new item.\n\nI've tried sitting her down and explaining to her that she's not helping me, but she keeps doing it. \n\nThe low point came last week when she got really stuck on a carton of yogurt I had bought. She noticed the expiration date was coming up (in four days) and asked when I was going to eat it. I said later. Then she asked if I wanted it for lunch. I said yogurt that had been sitting in my hot car for hours wasn't an appetizing lunch idea, which encouraged her to start Googling how long yogurt can sit out for. This allowed me to get the rest of my belongings and head out.\n\nAs I pulled out of the driveway my wife came out the front door in her pajamas and started trying to chase me down on foot, shouting about the yogurt. I waved and left.\n\nThat was my breaking point. After work I went shopping and got myself a cheap pair of noise canceling earbuds. From the next morning, I put them in, played some white noise (I'm not a big music guy), and went about my business. My wife kept trying to get my attention by waving her hand in front of my face, as she held miscellaneous items, but it was a lot easier than normal. I've also found that sending her on a little mission to get something will help a lot and wish I had thought of it sooner.\n\nLast night she sat me down and got really angry for ignoring her in the morning. I asked what I was supposed to do, to which she responded \"You're supposed to listen to your wife.\" \n\nDid I go too far for taking this step?", "created_utc": 1689990357, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1566rfb/aita_for_buying_noise_canceling_earbuds_to_tune/", "score": 1813, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This genius music professor kept being told there was something wrong with his vision, optometrist sent him to psychiatrist who sent him to a neurologist. Perfect vision. Then on his way out he went to grab his hat, and instead accidentally grabbed his wife's head, who had taken the hat off the coat rack for him and was holding it in her hand. She had also moved his shoes that he took off to the  chair beside her and he almost walked right out the door without them because he couldn't see them on the floor where he left them and assumed he had just put them back on absentmindedly.\n\nDr. Sacks eventually figured out that as he had matured, his visual cortex never grew with him, and eventually the rest of his brain just sorta grew into that space and ultimately compressed and strangled that part of his brain. In short, he had no visual memory.\n\nSacks wanted to observe his morning routine to see how this guy could even function, let alone go 60 years with hardly anyone noticing his condition. And the answer was a combination of extraordinary abstract reasoning and logic skills, but also unparalleled pattern recognition, rhythm utilization (remember he's a music professor) and an uncompromising devotion to established routine. He'd put on a record and saute up some aromatics and build himself a sound and smellscape that he understood implicitly, so he didn't need visual memory to function, as long as he kept to the usual rhythm. When something throws that rhythm off, like his wife taking his hat off the rack or moving his shoes to the other side of the room, or stops the record to ask a question, he becomes instantly lost in his own home, and effectively blind with 20/20 vision. \n\nTl;dr - don't fuck with your SO's morning routine, pls.", "Have to agree with what you said.
