His treatment was complicated and keeping him at home required 24h care, and it was too much for his parents to manage. When I wasn\u2019t there I had to hire a nurse.\n\nI love him with my entire soul and never ever considered not caring for him. It was just normal to me and his well-being and care took priority over everything else in my life. When he passed, I found myself alone with a car, a dog an an urn. I had no job, no home (we had been living at his parents until he had to move to the hospice), hadn\u2019t maintained friendships in the city we were in and I had no family other than his in our city.\n\nIf there was one topic I was always uncomfortable with, it was his will and how he was to distribute money from his life insurance policy. He comes from a wealthier family than I, we weren\u2019t married, and I was worried that people would think I manipulated him in order to get money. I told him that, and asked that he makes the decision by himself. He thought this was ridiculous and that his family would never think that I was after his money or that he could even be manipulated, but I was raised in a family where money was an uncomfortable topic anyway and convinced him to leave me out of his decision.\n\nHe decided to leave me 60% of the money, and 10% to each of his 4 siblings. Nothing to his parents. He said I had left my job for him, had no family nearby to help and no home, and would need help building this back. He also wanted me to pay off my student loan, go back to school and get another degree, and buy a home so I wouldn\u2019t have to look for a rental for me and our 80lbs dog.\n\nI said don\u2019t you think your parents should get some and he said that his parents are doing ok, his family has each other, and that I would be the one who would need money. He was confident that people would understand and no one would complain.\n\nWhen he passed, his sister was the executor of his will and asked me if I wanted to give his parents money from the amount he left me since he left them nothing. I said no because I had asked him and he had said no and meant for this money to be mine. \n\nI love his parents. But he was right, when he passed I found myself with nothing, just a car a dog and an urn, unable to work or think, and understood that I would indeed need money to get back on my feet.\n\nAITA? His sister thinks so. I myself don\u2019t know. I feel guilty and I try to reassure myself reminding myself that this is what he wanted.\n\nEDIT: His parents have never asked for money and other siblings never mentioned it either. They are all angels and I love them very much. The sister I trust is doing what she thinks is best for her family.\n\nI feel like an asshole because the money is a lot, more than 2 years of my annual salary when I was working.", "created_utc": 1672256798, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxiyqv/aita_for_not_giving_my_inlaws_money_i_inherited/", "score": 153, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
