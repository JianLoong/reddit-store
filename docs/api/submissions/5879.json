When I wasn\u2019t there I had to hire a nurse.\n\nI love him with my entire soul and never ever considered not caring for him. It was just normal to me and his well-being and care took priority over everything else in my life. When he passed, I found myself alone with a car, a dog an an urn. I had no job, no home (we had been living at his parents until he had to move to the hospice), hadn\u2019t maintained friendships in the city we were in and I had no family other than his in our city.\n\nIf there was one topic I was always uncomfortable with, it was his will and how he was to distribute money from his life insurance policy. He comes from a wealthier family than I, we weren\u2019t married, and I was worried that people would think I manipulated him in order to get money. I told him that, and asked that he makes the decision by himself. He thought this was ridiculous and that his family would never think that I was after his money or that he could even be manipulated, but I was raised in a family where money was an uncomfortable topic anyway and convinced him to leave me out of his decision.\n\nHe decided to leave me 60% of the money, and 10% to each of his 4 siblings. Nothing to his parents. He said I had left my job for him, had no family nearby to help and no home, and would need help building this back. He also wanted me to pay off my student loan, go back to school and get another degree, and buy a home so I wouldn\u2019t have to look for a rental for me and our 80lbs dog.\n\nI said don\u2019t you think your parents should get some and he said that his parents are doing ok, his family has each other, and that I would be the one who would need money. He was confident that people would understand and no one would complain.\n\nWhen he passed, his sister was the executor of his will and asked me if I wanted to give his parents money from the amount he left me since he left them nothing. I said no because I had asked him and he had said no and meant for this money to be mine. \n\nI love his parents. But he was right, when he passed I found myself with nothing, just a car a dog and an urn, unable to work or think, and understood that I would indeed need money to get back on my feet.\n\nAITA? His sister thinks so. I myself don\u2019t know. I feel guilty and I try to reassure myself reminding myself that this is what he wanted.\n\nEDIT: His parents have never asked for money and other siblings never mentioned it either. They are all angels and I love them very much. The sister I trust is doing what she thinks is best for her family.\n\nEDIT2: Please be kind to his sister. Beyond what is happening with the will she lost her brother, and she is family to me. We don\u2019t get along, but I do believe she is a good person trying to look after her fam. I am saying this to reply to folks advising me to report her, I would never do this to his sister.\n\nAlso, I did get the money.

I\u2019d like to make some things clear.\n\n1. All of the love you felt for your partner, the reason you quit your job and cared for him without even thinking of something else, he felt the same for you. He loved you and it was important to him that you\u2019d be safe and able to sort you life out after he was gone.

As the executor of his will she should be following it and not attempting to manipulate and bully you into giving money to his parents, money they haven\u2019t even said they want. Maybe she\u2019s lost it a bit in grief, maybe she\u2019s a bad person, maybe she\u2019s even trying to get the money for herself. Whatever the reason isn\u2019t important, the money is legally yours and it\u2019s morally yours. You need to get it. Consider getting a solicitor to help with the proceedings because his sister isn\u2019t doing this properly. \n\n3. You\u2019ve had an incredibly traumatic loss, right now you must be dealing with unbelievable grief that I can only imagine. I think it\u2019s possible that\u2019s partly why you\u2019re not fighting for yourself and your own interests.  Life goes on, by fighting to build a brilliant one you\u2019re keeping your partner\u2019s memory alive and carrying him in your heart. Think about seeing a therapist for everything you\u2019ve been through. You deserve to be happy and to look after yourself. \n\nNTA Op.", "NTA but the sister is an AH.

It\u2019s sweet that he left some to siblings but I feel like in your post your are trying to justify keeping the money.  Stop that.  You do not need to justify it.", "Don't feel guilty. You put your life on hold to take care of your soulmate. This is his way of saying \"Thank you,\" and it's the only way left that he can say that he loves you and wants to take care of you like you took care of him. NTA", "NTA. Not in any way whatsoever.", "NTA \n\nMake the life he would want for you.", "NTA. If she had ideas about the inheritance, she needed to tell him. Not you. In fact, I suspect she did tell him exactly what she thinks\u2026 but didn\u2019t like his decision and hoped to get her way by pressuring you. It\u2019s shitty of her to pressure you and make you feel badly for his decision. How she feels about it is her problem.\n\nSorry for your terrible loss. It sounds like he loved you and did his best to look out for you, as you did your best to take good care of him. Good luck regaining your balance.", "NTA. You are honoring his explicit wishes. He specifically did not want to leave them anything.", "NTA but maybe in the future you can do something nice or buy something for his parents if the opportunity arises. That all depends on whether or not you continue same kind of relationship with them, but you have nothing to feel bad about.", "NTA . The money doesn't seem important to them, but if it helps you, spend some of it for something special to memorialise their son and gift it to them.", "That's nice that you want to think good things about her but she was their when he made the will. She knows his wishes but still felt that she should say something.  You put your life on hold for 2yrs to care for your husband 24/7 because you love him and this is his way of making sure your taken care of. Even if the money was more than what you normally made, you earned it will all the care you provided. If you had been a nurse you would have been paid a lot of money to do the same work.", "In the post there is no mention of the parents receiving anything. It didn't have to be money. If this was the case it seems rather stark. Logic isn't the only consideration.\n\nIt was of course entirely your partner's business what he did with what he owned.\n\nI said the siblings could give money, in reaction to the sister's thoughtless suggestion that you should give to them.", "+1.  That's less than the suggested life insurance policy.  You can go through that *very fast*, especially with end of life expenses.", ">This sister is getting 10% of the proceeds which would make this a very dodgy thing she did.\n\nhuh but this totally legit copy of the will states she gets everything, nothing suspicious at all", "The money doesn\u2019t sound like a lot tbh. 2 years salary go in a flash.\n\nIMO you would be TA if you didn\u2019t respect his last wishes.", "I am so sorry for your loss. NTA.", "NTA. More than 2x years of your annual salary is a lot, but in the grand scheme of things it is not a lot of money for the rest of your life, or their lives. Use it to take care of yourself, and if after that you still desire to give them something, go ahead.", "NTA, and please, try not to feel guilty. It sounds like your soul mate was a great man and thought way ahead to take care of you. This is him doing that. He wanted to make sure, that once he was gone, you'd be able to get back on your feet and start anew. It's a blessing and a curse, but, it's out of love. So, hold your head high, keep his memory alive in your heart and in your soul. You'll see him again someday.", "Why do you think that, I haven\u2019t shared anything thing about his funeral arrangements", "If this is truly just money from a life insurance payout, does the will or sister being executor really matter here?   The life insurance company should just pay the beneficiaries as specified in the policy.  And if the sister is so hung up on parents getting some of the money, she could always volunteer some of the 10% she is receiving\u2026", "Is pulling on that thread a good idea? NAL but it occurs to me that there's small chance that could end up invalidating the will...", "Eh. He probably trusted his sister. But she, as a professional, should have known that it\u2019s unethical even if her initial intention was to just follow what she\u2019s supposed to as an executor. This kind of ethics and conflicts of interests are harder to comprehend as an outsider.", "NTA.   I\u2019m sorry that you lost your beloved.   Just follow his wishes in the will.   His sister doesn\u2019t need to involve herself.", "NTA - do I get this right and you got kicked out of his parents house the second he died? If so why would anyone even think about givin them money?", "NTA and it's mean and judgmental for her to come out and say to give some money to his parents. Doing what he wanted and legally requested is the right thing.", "NTA. I need to comment and tell you that you NEED that money. Your partner wants you to take care of yourself and your dog. You gave him so much and now he wants you to take care of yourself. It's literally his dying wish. You're still grieving. Take time and don't make any rash decisions. Protect yourself and slowly build yourself back up.  Don't allow his sister to mistreat you or to do anything against his will.", "NTA - You gave up everything to care for him. He knew what he wanted, and you have to trust that if he wanted his parents to have some of his money he would have given it to them. If he is from a wealthy family, his parents should have plenty of money. You keep the money he wanted you, his soulmate to have and work on getting your life back in order for you and your dog. \n\nAlso, I am so sorry for your loss! Losing my husband is one of the worst things I could possibly imagine. I know after watching loved ones battle with something so terrible that you can wind up feeling happy for them that they are out of pain and not suffering any longer, though. Grief is a very odd thing, and I wish you all the best!", "No I was never kicked out of his parents\u2019. We moved to hospice for end of life care (dog and I lived on the sleeper couch there too) and after he died we were offered a place to stay at the parents\u2019 or brother\u2019s. I have to say that after being in very close quarters with him and his family for so long I needed the space and had to leave to be on my own, at least for a little while. \n\nWhen I write that I didn\u2019t have a home, it was because we had been renting then moved to his parents basement so they could be close and we wouldn\u2019t have to pay rent. So I didn\u2019t have a home to go back to after hospice, but his parents would have let me stay in the basement if I wanted or needed to.", "Ohh I see. That\u2019s way more reasonable. Still sucks but for reasons far away of the in-laws. I\u2019m sorry for your lost. I still believe you should accept the will of your soulmate. Get your PIL a nice gift as an thank you, don\u2019t be cheep with it but I suggest something emotional, and everything\u2019s fine.\n\nMaybe think about giving money IF there is something left when you\u2019re back on your own feet again. But that\u2019s totally optional and just an suggestion to make you feel more comfortable (in this way you would fulfill your BFs wish of helping you getting a new life).", "NTA.  I think it was inappropriate for the sister to ask honestly.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA\n\nA lot of people see life insurance as just a payout when someone dies. But in reality, it\u2019s for exactly your situation. It\u2019s supposed to be there to help the remaining spouse/significant other pay off any debt and help them with cost of living and the funeral. Don\u2019t feel guilty. He wouldn\u2019t want you to. He planned this exactly the way he wanted to.", "Why should money for the parents come from your share? The siblings can all chip in if they think the parents should have some money. \n\nAnd stop feeling guilty. Two Years' wages isn't *a lot* in the grand scheme of things, you need all of it to get back on your feet. You have nothing but a dog. They have each other and already have money. \n\nNTA", "NTA. I think it's bizarre he gave anything to his siblings, especially since he was married. I know you were uncomfortable with the money topic, but it's very typical to give the spouse all the inheritance. \n\nIt would be strange to give his parents money, I would let that go and ignore this conversation with the sister. I know this might be tough for you, but maybe you could give the urn to his parents (when you are ready.) Money wouldn't mean anything to them, but having his ashes would.", "NTA. If the sister is worried about the parents, let her give them money from HER inheritance, not YOURS. Do not dispute your beloved's last wishes. He knew exactly the right thing to do for you.", "NTA. Not as bad as I expected. If the parents hired the nurse then that may be why the sister was asking, to reimburse the parents. If that was covered by insurance or yourself then the sister should leave it. \n\nYou'll need that money to build your life, whether you stay in that area or move closer to your parents.", "She shouldn't be asking you. She knows what her brother's wishes were, and she probably knows his reasoning too - and it was good reasoning! \n\nYou gave up everything and put yourself at immense financial disadvantage to look after your partner. He appreciated your sacrifice for him, and this inheritance was meant to help you get back to a secure footing.", "Reporting the exector for unethical behavior will not invalidate the will. She's an attorney and subject to ethics rules. Her role as executor is to distribute the assets per the will, not attempt to subvert the will for the benefit of her family.", "Nta. Please report her to her parents as they may be horrified that she\u2019s asking this of you not to mention how hypocritical if her is it to expect you to pay them out of your money so that she doesn\u2019t have to pay them out of hers.", "NTA. She should give her $$ to her parents. Do not feel guilty. Your soulmate wanted you to have it. I am sorry for your loss.", "NTA here. You are gettting per the will. Accept it and move on into your new life.", "First sorry for your loss, second it was his wishes he has left you with memories and a legacy to rebuild your life. His parents have his siblings and everything else. Id speak to his parents and express what he told you his wishes were. Again sorry for your loss", "NTA accept with grace the money to finance the future your partner wanted you to have. He knew what he was doing, and so did his sister when she tried to persuade you to give their parents some of your inheritance. I'm sorry for your loss and wish you all the best for your future.", "NTA \n\nIt baffles me that someone can make their wishes known and once they\u2019re gone everyone wants to disregard what they actually wanted. You should honour his wishes. It\u2019s what he wanted.", "NTA. You sacrificed a lot to care for him and he's returning the favor. Use the money to get established and if you are more financially set-up down the line and would like to give his parents something, then you can. Worry about yourself for now.", "NTA.\nI care for my grandparents full time and their various health issues. It's hard and can be thankless. You deserve the money.", "NTA. \n\nI understand she is grieving, but she is still a massive SH for even suggesting you give his parents any of the money. That is hateful and inappropriate. An executor is NOT supposed to behave like that.", "NTA sorry for your loss,  your SO made thier choice they wrote a will, everyone just needs to accept his choice.", "Lawyers and wills, yeuk. \n\nYou can ask for a copy of the accounts if you wish but she can fleece the account as much as she wants cuz she's a lawyer. \n\nIf she even thinks of the will as a lawyer, expect a 10 min to 15 min charge added to her bill. \n\nAs long as one chargeable item a week or so goes on, the SRA can't do a thing, even if she takes 3 years to pay up.", "Wait...  His own lawyer sister helped him write the will??\n\nThen the sister should know EXACTLY what his wishes were and why he did what he did.  There should be NO pressure on you to defend anything about his will.  Sister was there - she knows.  The fact that his sister then asked for money for her parents is really unethical.\n\nNTA", "Heya OP. Really sorry for your loss, and hope you are getting lots of love from the rest of your in-laws. The majority sound nice.\n\nPut sis-in-law on the need-to-know info. If she isn't directly involved, she doesn't need to know. She is looking out for her loved ones, and unfortunately you're not one of hers \ud83d\ude1f and if it keeps up, you can ask her if the responsibility as lawyer is crossing the lines between professional and personal conflict.

To act in the way she did is unconscionable.", "OP says she doesn\u2019t think the sister took anything , and has distributed the money as the will required.

More important things in life to worry about.", "op=NAH\n\nYou provided care to your dying partner.  you need that money to pay for housing, go back to school(if you choose).\n\nFollow your partner's wishes, take time to grieve but then live life.  That is what your partner wanted.  \n\nI recommend investing some of the money(safely) so that if for some reason the parents did need something in the future, you have could help them out(tho they have four other kids who can do so).  Anything invested can be a cushion.  \n\nHis sister, was perhaps not the one he should have picked for his trustee since she doesn't seem emotionally ready to deal with the real world aspects. \n\nRe your edits I switched to No one instead of Not A-H, because you give her the grace of grief, I will too.", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t let feelings of guilt manipulate you into making decisions you will regret later.

It is wild and extremely unethical that his sister tried to take from you what is rightfully yours, what her brother wanted, and money you clearly need. She is not a nice person and you are being far, far too generous giving her the benefit of the doubt.
