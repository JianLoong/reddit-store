His treatment was complicated and keeping him at home required 24h care, and it was too much for his parents to manage. When I wasn\u2019t there I had to hire a nurse.\n\nI love him with my entire soul and never ever considered not caring for him. It was just normal to me and his well-being and care took priority over everything else in my life. When he passed, I found myself alone with a car, a dog an an urn. I had no job, no home (we had been living at his parents until he had to move to the hospice), hadn\u2019t maintained friendships in the city we were in and I had no family other than his in our city.\n\nIf there was one topic I was always uncomfortable with, it was his will and how he was to distribute money from his life insurance policy. He comes from a wealthier family than I, we weren\u2019t married, and I was worried that people would think I manipulated him in order to get money. I told him that, and asked that he makes the decision by himself. He thought this was ridiculous and that his family would never think that I was after his money or that he could even be manipulated, but I was raised in a family where money was an uncomfortable topic anyway and convinced him to leave me out of his decision.\n\nHe decided to leave me 60% of the money, and 10% to each of his 4 siblings. Nothing to his parents. He said I had left my job for him, had no family nearby to help and no home, and would need help building this back. He also wanted me to pay off my student loan, go back to school and get another degree, and buy a home so I wouldn\u2019t have to look for a rental for me and our 80lbs dog.\n\nI said don\u2019t you think your parents should get some and he said that his parents are doing ok, his family has each other, and that I would be the one who would need money. He was confident that people would understand and no one would complain.\n\nWhen he passed, his sister was the executor of his will and asked me if I wanted to give his parents money from the amount he left me since he left them nothing. I said no because I had asked him and he had said no and meant for this money to be mine. \n\nI love his parents. But he was right, when he passed I found myself with nothing, just a car a dog and an urn, unable to work or think, and understood that I would indeed need money to get back on my feet.\n\nAITA? His sister thinks so. I myself don\u2019t know. I feel guilty and I try to reassure myself reminding myself that this is what he wanted.\n\nEDIT: His parents have never asked for money and other siblings never mentioned it either. They are all angels and I love them very much. The sister I trust is doing what she thinks is best for her family.\n\nI feel like an asshole because the money is a lot, more than 2 years of my annual salary when I was working.", "created_utc": 1672256798, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxiyqv/aita_for_not_giving_my_inlaws_money_i_inherited/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

After he passed his sister/executor asked if I would give money to his parents since he left me everything and them nothing - I said no.

It's not your responsibility to redistribute the money to his parents or anyone else, especially if your soulmate specifically chose not to include them in his will.

She was the lawyer who helped us when he designated me as his agent, even tho she made it known that she disagreed. Her sister doesn\u2019t like me. She helped him write the will and insisted that she should be the executor. \n\nIn these situations where everything is out of ones control it\u2019s important to feel like you are able to help, and he finally allowed her to be his executor. \n\nI have to trust here and I truly don\u2019t care even if she was to secretly take money for her parents, which I don\u2019t think she did.

She helped raise him and has always wanted to protect him like a mother. I is peeved because he made me, not her, his medical agent.", "Not appropriate to joke about tax evasion on this post. Are you completely tone deaf?", "No. She's supposed to follow the will and not to suggest you give anything to anyone else. I'd report her to the lawyers board.", "I would still be wary and get things checked out by another reliable lawyer.", "Yeesh. Sounds like a monster-in-law if I\u2019ve ever seen one. She\u2019s overly protective, bitter her brother didn\u2019t ask her to care for him, and definitely bitter about the break up of his money, and of course this is all amplified by his death. Pay her no mind, and just go with what your soulmate requested. She is going to be bitter regardless of what you say or do, and there\u2019s nothing you can do to change that. Stand strong and be your soulmate\u2019s advocate. Maybe talk to other family members as well that you are on better terms with.  But do not change the will\u2026 obey his final wishes. I am not familiar with how wills go, but she can\u2019t decide against his wishes can she?

That she's a lawyer makes this so much worse because she knows better."]}
