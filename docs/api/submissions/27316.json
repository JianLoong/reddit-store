Do this as attractively as you can, maybe giving the note a colorful border with pictures of calla lilies.  \n\nA lot depends on how you introduce the idea.  As you've seen, with your family, in-person discussion isn't working.

My old Texas neighbor used to refer to my son as \u2018Quattro\u2019.", "My partner is Puerto Rican and his great nephew is a 5th and we all call him Cinco. I don't even know what his real name is!", "In reality very little people do this anymore and it's very informal. It's a more like people using it or don't and i never before (or after) met sometime doing this \"same name in every generation) if the kid has the same name is mostly using junior and senior only if there is a need to differentiate them and at some point in the future (often after death of senior) the if is simply ditching the addition completly.\n\nThis was a very rare and very strange case. But yes in theory it would be more of a passing down the additions to the name.", "I rather see this ridiculous tradition continue to die out", "Yeah, don\u2019t get me started on my disdain for this entire family with god complexes.", "The jr/sr thing is still pretty common where I am. They revert to numbers on or after the third generation. I hate it."]}
