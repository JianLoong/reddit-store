{"id": 26131, "submission_id": "168yj2t", "title": "AITA for leaving only the house to one child?", "selftext": "My partner and I have two sons. The older is married and doesn\u2019t plan on having children, the younger is also married but with two young kids. In addition the older lives in the same state as us while the younger is about 8 hours away. Both own their own homes already and are for the most part financially stable. \n\n\nOur house has been in the family for generations. It\u2019s on an estate with a few hundred acres of land and the building itself is mostly original, a couple hundred years old. It admittedly does have its quirks and the size makes management a little difficult but is a wonderful home. It\u2019s most recent appraisal was a bit over 3 million dollars. \n\n\nA couple months ago my younger son was visiting with his family and I mentioned how the house would be his one day. He winced a little and I asked what was wrong. He hesitantly admitted that he doesn\u2019t want the house or anything to do with it. His family has no intention of moving back north and if they did it would be the other side of the state. I\u2019ll admit it was disappointing to hear since our intent was to split all assets evenly- including the house- so that it would stay in the family and continue to be the meeting place. \n\n\nMy spouse and I talked it through and decided to change our wills. The house would go entirely to my older son and our other main assets (bank accounts, investments) would go to our younger. They can split the physical items between them. The house is worth more since the cash and investments are only around 2 million. \n\n\nWe had a group call and brought up the new will. My oldest was upset to say the least. He said he can\u2019t move to the house either since he and his wife both work in the other side of the state (a 5 hour drive) and love their jobs. They have pensions, career tracks, and don\u2019t plan on leaving. I said they could have someone maintain the house when they aren\u2019t using it but he just got annoyed and said that would be a massive drain on their finances, let alone property tax and if anything breaks and needs repair. I said he\u2019s being a brat since his brother lives farther and has a family to care for, the house doesn\u2019t work for him and we want to be fair. The call ended very tense.\n\n\nMy younger is pleased with the outcome but my older is obviously not. He later said he now knows we favor his brother and will keep that in mind when elder care comes up and he\u2019s the one nearby. This seems like a low blow but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s deserved. AITA?\n\nEdit: I was told to add this to the main post. The house cannot be sold, by us or either son. A long time ago previous owners made a deal with the town to pay less in property taxes in exchange for the surrounding acreage being public trails. It also had a provision that the house cannot be sold publicly, if we no longer wanted the property the town will buy it for land value.", "created_utc": 1693751493, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168yj2t/aita_for_leaving_only_the_house_to_one_child/", "score": 1589, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're essentially leaving your older child a burden and your younger child free cash. The values aren't the same at all. \n\nCan you set up a trust and turn the house into a venue or something? That way your kids can both receive income from it rather than your current split. Another alternative: what about extended family? Do any of your siblings/niblings/cousins want the house?

If you want them to feel that you've treated them fairly, split the cash assets equally and let them sell the house for land value and split the proceeds.  Of course, its your stuff, you *can* divide it however you want.  But you need to understand that your kids view that house as a burden, not an inheritance.

There could also be additional restrictions on what owners can and cannot do with the property.", "Who's going to rent a mansion with 'quirks' in the middle of nowhere?", "Maybe, but maybe neither of the sons wants the burden of running it out. Even with the management company there is still lots of burden on the owner. Neither of them even lose remotely close.", "He procreated", "According to the op, the provision is that it can only be sold back to the town for land value. It can't be sold to anybody but the town.", "How are they all \"millionaires\"?  By OP's own admission the house is old but nothing special and \"quirky\" aka rundown.  The cost to manage the house by an outside company is WAY more than 15% and they'd have to pay taxes, insurance, utilities and maintenance.", "I know someone who got in an imminent domain fight with the county. Took 7 years to settle. Then they had to go back to court to get interest.\n\nThey will have a hard time fighting for more than the city offers since they have had a tax break for so long.", "He wants to saddle someone with this burden and is trying to play it as if it's an asset. So his shot misfired on one, now he's working the other. Sometimes you have to accept that your children don't view the things that you value in the same way, especially if it complicates their lives or is burdensome. The soon OP accepts it, the sooner they can move on as a family and enjoy their time now.", "I'm going to guess because the younger one has kids and the older one doesn't. So \"family legacy\" is a big deal to this person. Fucking WILD.", "Because the brat is childfree.", "What she wants does  matter. The house has value as it's an old house. Will it to someone who loves the house and has the time and money to maintain it.", "They would probably get practically nothing for it, depending on where it is. And even then, towns are known for lowballing, especially when they know that the seller literally has no leverage.", "Open market.  This can't be out on the open market.  Therefore of no value to anyone besides the town.  Who most likely is restricted as to what they can do it as well\n\nI just sold a lot for a bit under 300k because it can be built on.  Unbuildable it would be worth squat.", "This! He wants to put an albatross around someone's neck and both sons are decling the offer. The fact that the house and property can't be sold except to the township is incredibly important.", "Screw that. OP should sell the house to the township and divide the remaining assets between charities of his choice.", "Yes", "From what OP mentioned in  a comment, they can only sell it for the cost of the land the house is built on.", "The town only buys the land the house is on. In essence, the \"hundreds of acres\" already belong to the town.", "My parents don\u2019t owe me a dime, and I hope they spend and enjoy as much as they want to stay happy for every last day of their lives. BUT, if they actually planned on leaving millions to my sibling free and clear while saddling me with property I don\u2019t want and can\u2019t even sell on the open market, I\u2019d be pissed. Then again, I\u2019m an only child, so I may be missing something.", "I respectfully disagree.  If they cannot treat their children fairly, they should not have had children.  It is cruel and damaging to favor one child over the other.  \n\n\nThis decision is flagrantly unfair.  The mere reactions are clear indications something is wrong.  One brother is despondent and in pain; the other is click-his-heels gleeful.\n\n\nThe narrator trickle-truths and twists the presentation of the facts for a favorable ruling.  (I actually suspect it might be rage-bait.).  The older son \u2018lives in the same state\u2019.  He lives FIVE hours away while little brother lives EIGHT hours away.  Neither is within commuting distance of their jobs/lives.  Also, the whole \u201cthe house is about $3 million and the cash is about $2 million so it is about the same.\u201d  Nope.  The truth is the house is worthless.  The land is worth only what the city is willing to pay, which will not be a premium - with a huge ancient home that has to be demolished or remodeled/maintained.  \n\n\nNah, cut the estate evenly or leave it all to charity.  I forgive the older brother\u2019s heartbroken reaction.  I am less forgiving of the younger brother\u2019s rollicking exultation.  Why couldn\u2019t the younger brother have been happy with an extra *$1 million*?  That\u2019s a freaking windfall to most people.", "1000% guaratnee a 300 year old property is a money pit. The way OP describes things make me thing this is a colonial in new england. Just heating those homes costs an absolute FORTUNE and many of them are in historic protected areas and you can not add or change things unless they are period appropriate. You can often do things like insulate, but you can't change the face or the building style, even inside. And the city has to inspect and approve everything. It costs more because those types of craftsmen are hard to get. It's just crazy if you don't have an endless stream of money to burn.\n \nBased on the sons' reactions, I'm guessing this is exactly the case.\n\nETA: Just saw this...\n\n>  It\u2019s not old or fancy enough to be a historical landmark and preserved.\n\nMy god, it's not even a historic property. It's a money pit that no one can sell. I didn't think it could get worse, and it did. OP how the hell are you justifying leaving your one son this money pit, and your other son an entire portfolio worth 2 mil with no catch. No wonder younger son was chuffed and older son asked why younger was the favorite. Good grief.", "I could see it used as an event venue. So not a regular rental, but a rental for weddings and such.", "A big house on 100 acres? A lot of people, I imagine. Even a discounted rent would likely be better than selling it for the value of the land.", "I\u2019d 100% rent a quirky mansion in the middle of no where tbh.", "Yeah but why? What kind of law is that?", "They are millionaires because the sons wound each be the heir to 1 million dollars since 2 million divide by 2 is 1 million each. If the house is worth that much they could charge enough rent to pay for taxes & bills", "But nobody in the family wants the house, so the legacy is finished one way or another.\n\nOP just changed the will so one brother inherit significantly more, while the other has to deal with a loval government they are *no longer* local to, to dump an asset as fast as possible.\nThat or they refuse to receive it, in wich case they inherit nothing.\n\nEither way the legacy is dead.", "He? I can\u2019t find anywhere in the post or in any of their comments where OP makes that designation. What makes you assume it\u2019s a he?", "Considering the fact that neither son wants the house that's still the best option. Sell the the land to the town and split everything equally after that. OP is stuck on trying to keep the house and force the older son to take care of it. The land is worthless to either son besides the money that can be gained when sold, so just sell it and split it.", "Which is a lot of money. Because it's a vouple hundred acres, and one acre lot can go for over 10k on average", "She stated, \"buy the property.\" I take that to mean the entire thing, not just the land underneath the house. The previous owner allowed public use for a tax break, but again, we don't know what that means. I took it to mean they own all \"couple hundred acres,\" but they were getting the break on public use. Unless OP comments and clears this up, there's no way to determine which it is. I'll completely change my mind if all they OWN is the house and land it sits on.", "You keep making this argument but I don't think you understand that the township is not going to purchase the land for the same price it could be sold publicly. Because it can only be sold to the township it's going to be worth considerably less than it would be otherwise, so yeah it's not worth 3 million.", "It said they got tax breaks for allowing public trails to be constructed and used on the surrounding acreage. Can you point me to where OP states they sold the land to the town already, because I cannot. Mixed use land is a thing. I have plenty of owned land near me that have been made into partial public use for tax purposes.", "Maybe, I get the impression it's not in a very good condition from how OP talks about it though.", "That would require someone actively managing it...", "A lot would depend on the 'quirks' which could be anything from \"the floors squeak\" to \"you'll have to spend XXX per year on heat, because the furnace is ancient and there's no insulation.\"  Maintaining a 19th-century house is hard work and costs a lot of money.  It's not like you can rip down the wallboard, put in a new plumbing line, then put up wallboard and paint it again.\n\nMy house is only from the 1930s, and since we've moved in, we've found out the septic system needs major repairs, the roof needs replacement, there's knob-and-tube wiring that is only partially replaced, and a lot of little wear-and-tear work needed doing.  I love it, but it's a lot more work than my previous, late-20th-century houses.\n\nA renter isn't going to take responsibility for doing all the repairs.  The owner is going to have to come back to the house, hire workmen, supervise the workmen, as well as checking regularly in case the renters damage the building.  The damage risk is even greater if it's being used for an entertainment facility.", "True, I'm not saying it's completely worthless, but I seriously doubt you could get a rent to justify the 3m valuation.

It does not end well!", "You probably can't afford the property taxes and so on though.", "the OP admits the house isn't worth 3 M in the comments.", "Well I could've done a S/he every time a gender specific pronoun was required to appease you specifically,  but I chose not to do so.

So while the OP is legally deed owner to the property, there's deed restrictions preventing the owner from taking certain actions on the property.", "OP said in a comment \"The house cannot be sold. A few owners ago they made a deal with the town to only pay property tax on the house and gardens, not the full surrounding forest, *in exchange for the forest being public land*. It has trails and all that. Another provision is that should the house leave our family the town will *buy it for the value of the land the house is on*, basically pennies on the dollar. This is to prevent developers from snatching it up. It also means the house stays in the family or is worthless.\"", "They have 3mil. They can probably fix it for 100-200k.

If it\u2019s a nice house in a decent area you can rent that shit out or turn it into an air bnb since it sounds like in right in the middle of an outdorsey area.

Central heating just wasn't a thing in the 90s in the UK unless you had money to spare or had a business that was based in your home (like childminding).

Stately homes in the UK are owned by the mega rich, converted to hotels or quickly fall into disrepair. It\u2019s not just the maintenance, it\u2019s the cost of the skilled labour to do the maintenance. We don\u2019t build the way we used to, so not just any builder can do the work. \n\nYou could maybe make the house work as a rental, but the management and maintenance will make it a lot of work for sweet F A, and it seems the son knows this. \n\nI do hope OP updates us with their final decision after this post."]}
