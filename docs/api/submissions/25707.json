This is bizarre, and fascinating. People are so weird, lol.\n\nHonestly though, I think the lock was enough. I don't think there's any need for a confrontation.  Fold it up once dry and put it in a bag outside your gate.", "NTA; it\u2019s really weird someone would just trespass on your property to hang their laundry. I really want an update once the culprits come back to find your gate locked!", "It\u2019s your garden, not a communal laundry drying service. I would keep the  gate locked from now on. \n\nYour clothesline is new, the duvet owners had to use alternate drying methods before you. They can use alternate drying methods going forward, too. NTA", "NTA.  Obviously it\u2019s your garden so someone is really taking liberties.  Your boyfriend\u2019s idea is perfect and the lock is completely appropriate.", "NTA. This is very strange situation. Maybe it is one neighbor who was allowed to do this by the porivios owner and doesn't know, that the masionette now belongs to someone new. Maybe some older neighbor with dementia has confused your garden with her/his. Or maybe it is some kind of prank. Just do like your parnter says, wait if someone knocks on your door to collect the washing and inform them about the situation. Or if no one is knocking (because dementia, or someone stole the laundry to put it there) make a flyer with photos of the laundry and put it out in your neighborhood - maybe so someone will notice and remember where this stuff is.", "NTA. Good to set firm boundaries right from the start with neighbors with that level of entitlement.", "NTA, that's a bizzar thing to do", "How odd...\n\nNTA.  Maybe the former people that lived there shared their laundry line?  Dunno.  Seems pretty ballsy to walk into someone's yard and hang your clothes without asking.", "NTA update us if mystery duvet is ever solved", "NTA.\nIt's your garden and your line. They didn't even ask if they could use it. \nYou're nicer than I would be. I'd have tossed the lot. Keep your gate locked from now on. God only know how long they've been doing this.", "Oh please update on this. It's just so  delightfully weird. Did they think it was a communal line or do they know its yours but figured if you aren't using it it's fair game? Did having to go through a gate not tip them off?\n\nYou aren't the asshole, unless you don't fill us in and what was going on.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou said it: it's YOUR garden. Lock it.", "Of course NTA, it\u2019s *your property*, so of course you can have a lock on the gate. And the NERVE to use someone else\u2019s line in their yard without even so much as asking permission. I would have done exactly the same thing", "NTA. Someone just felt entitled to use your line without asking. You\u2019ll want to nip that in the bud before they feel entitled to something else. A lock is definitely the way to go. But please let us know who it was when they come to get the washing.", "NTA.\n\nThis is not a public line.  Lock is perfectly acceptable for your own yard.  This will be interesting.  Maybe the neighbor's cat hung their sheets for them.  Cats rule over everything.", "I think locking it and telling them not to do it again is way nicer than binning the clothes. Good solution, NTA", "NTA, the imagination that people think they are entitled to use your property without permission. In the event they trip would you be held liable for their broken face or soiled laundry? They suck!", "NTA, but I suppose a soft one.\n\nThe neighbour is certainly out of *line* for doing this without asking, but it's mostly harmless.

I think you've just got yourself some new bedsheets because if I was your neighbour I wouldn't have the nerve to knock on your door and ask for my washing back like a kid with a football!", "I agree? I wouldn\u2019t mind if they had knocked first\u2026 it was only a small amount of washing they put up so maybe I\u2019m being petty but everyone has their own gardens around here and they have managed just fine for the past 4 weeks?", "I will keep you updated \ud83d\ude02", "I thought the same thing at first but there was no line in the garden when we moved in? We have brought it and put it up ourselves\u2026 and everyone knows we have just moved in so if they had prior arrangements with the old tenant I\u2019d just want them to ask me again to double check?", "I\u2019m honestly not sure no one has knocked yet so \ud83d\ude02 everyone has their own gardens around here so a communal garden would make no sense at all?", "It was only a couple of bed sheets- but I didn\u2019t mean I\u2019d put them in the bin just ontop of the lid- I would never bin them. Just waiting to see who\u2019s washing it is now", "Especially because we are just about to get the patio relayed\u2026 because it\u2019s very very uneven \ud83d\ude02", "I agree, I definitely giggled with my in-laws when I\u2019ve just told them \ud83d\ude02 it is harmless but what if my underwear was drying out there I don\u2019t want them seeing that \ud83d\ude02", "Not wanting someone to trespass and use your property without permission isn't being petty. The amount of laundry doesn't matter. It could have been a single sock and you still wouldn't be petty to lock your gate.", "> I\u2019d just want them to ask me again to double check?\n\nPerfectly reasonable expectation.", "I have a laundry line in my yard that I can take down easily using hooks because I just don't like the look of it hanging unused. I measure out the length I need and make knots so that when I need to use it, I just slip the knots over the hooks. Maybe try that? NTA. This is way out of bounds.", "NTA - I would have taken it down and thrown it away.  It's your property and they ahve no right to tresspass.", "NTA, and I need a follow up!", "While I'm sure 'masionette' was a typo for 'maisonette', this post is much more entertaining if it's a typo for marionette, and OP has a nice little garden next to the giant puppet they live in\n\nEdit:  NTA, assuming this isn't a communal space somehow", "NTA. One time, I hung lines for my mom to hang her laundry. The neighbor started using it without asking, and my mom would have to wait to do laundry. I took the lines down when my mom wasn't using them and popped off the pulley so they couldn't hang their own line from my work.", "I wouldn't mind if they snuck into my backyard and hung up MY laundry!", "Was your place empty for awhile?  Maybe one of the neighbors got used to using the laundry lines in an unoccupied house?\n\nThat still doesn't explain why they think it's acceptable to continue after someone moved in, though.   That's bizarre.", "OP noted elsewhere that the lines were newly installed."]}
