{"id": 20580, "submission_id": "14iov4d", "title": "AITA for doing things for all but one of my flatmates?", "selftext": "I \\[22M\\] live with three other people; \"Sam\" \\[19M\\], \"Laura\" \\[19F\\] and \"Beth\" \\[20F\\]. We have a cleaning agreement where personal spaces and things like dishes etc. we take care of our own, but communal areas we take turns cleaning on a weekly basis. Generally, we all stick to this. However, I have a habit of picking up little bits here and there. E.g. if I'm doing my dishes and I see that somebody has left one or two bits, I'll just wash it. If someone missed a spot when they were wiping down the kitchen side or cleaning up a spill after they cooked, I'll wipe that spot. You get the idea: I'm not gonna do your chores for you, but if it's something small that doesn't take any more time out of my day, I don't mind doing it. Sam and Beth seem to understand this concept. Laura, less so. \n\nIt started a few months back when she noticed that the plate she'd left by the sink after dinner had been washed. She texted into our group chat asking who cleaned it and I said I was doing my dishes and it was there so I just did it with mine. After that, I started noticing that basically every day there would be several dishes by the sink every time I went to do mine, and the pile started to grow and grow until there was a full sink's worth of dishes. She also completely stopped bothering to wipe down the counters after she cooked or mopping up any spills from the floor when she realised my habit of picking up bits like that. So I just stopped. I'll still do it for Sam and Beth because they're not exploiting it, but if there are any of Laura's dishes in or by the sink, I will ignore them no matter how many or few there are. If there's a spill on the floor or crumbs on the side, I'll ask in the GC who last cooked and if it was Laura, I'll leave it for her to pick up after herself but if it's the other two I don't mind doing it. I have explained to her as politely as I could that I didn't mind doing it for her too until she started going overboard, and she just kind of huffed, said whatever and left it. \n\nEarlier this week, Laura's sister came to visit and she and I ended up in a confrontation. She accused me of being a bully who singles out Laura and treats her differently from the other two. I explained why I do so and said that it's not bullying, it's just me not allowing my kindness to be exploited by someone who is too lazy to pick up after herself. Her sister said that Laura has ADHD so she finds some things more difficult, but I said that's no excuse because she managed perfectly fine until she realised my habit of helping out sometimes. Both Laura and her sister ended up calling me an arrogant arsehole and a bully, and I later got a text from their mum saying the same. I'm kind of conflicted now. Should I just stop helping everyone out to avoid singling her out? Should I just suck it up and pick up after her if I'm gonna do small bits for the others? Am I in the right for doing as I am now?

You\u2019re being very kind, but don\u2019t allow people to take advantage of you. That was exactly what Laura was doing. You did exactly what I would do too. Don\u2019t let her or her family get to you.", "NTA. If you do elect to stop helping out, it\u2019s 100% on Laura.", "She told her mom on you!?!? And her mom agrees with her, which is where this entitlement comes from. You are NTA.", "NTA\u2026 Laura tried to exploit ur kindness. You explain the issues to her and yes it\u2019s does suck that she is kinda of single out in this but it\u2019s her own fault.", "NTA. If anyone's being a bully here, it's Laura and her sister and mother.", "You\u2019re standing up for yourself and not allowing an a-hole to take advantage of your kindness. People who take advantage of other people\u2019s kindness disgust me. What a jerk. NTA", "NTA.  You don't live with or answer to  Laura's family. \nDon't engage with them at all. As pointed out, they are trying to bully you, but it won't work if you don't rise to the occasion. \n\nIf Laura is old enough to be out on her own, she's old enough to resolve her own 'conflicts ' and definitely old enough to abide by the house rules and clean up after herself. Stand your ground. You sound like a very considerate roommate.", "NTA \n\nId be pissed that she literally gave her mom your phone number and told on you\u2026 like wtf is that? Lol", "NTA\n\nLaura started taking your generosity for granted. It\u2019s not reasonable at all to be remiss of one\u2019s cleanliness duties and leaving it to others.\n\nI have been in a similar situation like you. Several times, my trash roommates would boil rice in a pot. They\u2019d close the lid and then forget about it altogether. For the first few times, I noticed it getting burnt and would turn it off or at least inform them. But those idiots would hardly thank me or even appreciate me doing this. I\u2019m not petty as to do it for their appreciation of me, but what vexed me is them not learning their lesson and repeating the same behavior. Well, I stopped informing them and they\u2019d have no choice but to eat burnt rice. This happened 10-15 times until the pot became unusable, then they just decided to buy a rice cooker. \n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to convey is that if people take you for granted when you do something that allows them to slack off, don\u2019t indulge them.", "NTA\n\nLaura and her entire family are massively entitled AH. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to deal with any of it you can stop helping anyone at any point. Full stop. \n\nThey aren\u2019t allowed to talk to you that way and you should advise Laura of that. Block the mother and sister. You probably can\u2019t block the roommate because of the need for household group messaging but just keep interactions short and perfunctory. \n\nI\u2019d be looking to get her out of the house as no one needs that drama. If you can\u2019t make her leave then you should leave. \n\nIf you have a landlord and separate leases you can lodge a complaint of harassment. You can advise the landlord that if her lease is renewed you will be seeking other accommodations.", "NTA. Also this is borderline harrasment from her sister and mother and is seriously consider reporting it to your landlord and/ or police if it persists. \n\nADHD is not an excuse to exploit other people because you are too lazy. Also if the mother and sister don't mind why doesn't she move back home with them?", "NTA and I would just stick to cleaning up after yourself and no one else. Even though Laura is totally exploiting your kindness, it\u2019s easier just to stop doing it for anyone that way she\u2019ll shut up", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You were trying to make life easier for all. \n\nYou were taken advantage of.  Thats is not right.\n\nADHD is not excuse to not clean up after yourself.

She was taking advantage of you. Do NOT clean up after her. She'll never learn to manage her ADHD if people keep enabling her. This isn't even about ADHD anyway.

Like the other flatmates and I had to teach her how to use a washing machine and a hoover when she moved in and until very recently the most complex thing she knew how to cook herself was scrambled eggs. Not a massive surprise to me that her mum joined in.", "Well, mystery solved on where Laura\u2019s whole attitude came from.\n\nNTA by the way", "Well there\u00b4s your answer, Mum has always done everything for her and now that she needs to fight a battle she calls Mum to do that for her too!\n\nNTA and good on you for drawing a line and sticking to it, she can either learn to clean up after herself or she can go back home with Mum", "I agree. If she wants things done for her it sounds like she should move back home with Mom"]}
