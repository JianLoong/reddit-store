It's your necklace, not hers, and it doesn't matter how cheap, borrowed, or old/new it is, you shouldn't be obligated to give it to your cousin.

Asking was okay, but the pushing and name-calling was not.", "definitely NTA, asking and expecting a yes isnt asking it\u2019s demanding. i don\u2019t understand why they needed it to specifically be your ring exactly, seems a bit strange to me", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what the cost of it was. It\u2019s important to you, and you said no. They were not assholes for asking the first time. But they became the assholes when they didn\u2019t accept the \u201cno\u201d that you gave, and called you selfish and weird.", "NTA - your reasoning completely makes sense, it\u2019s your property and they shouldn\u2019t have put you on the spot like that. Also, I\u2019m not a superstitious person in general, but pressuring someone unwilling to give you the \u201csomething borrowed\u201d has got to be bad luck.", "NTA.

It was special to you, regardless of cost, and you had the right to say no.

It\u2019s not your fault she didn\u2019t plan ahead if she wanted this tradition.", "NTA. The tradition clearly wasn't that important to her or she would have brought it up beforehand or agreed when you said you'd find something else blue for her to wear / borrow.

This might have been what they thought was a nice way to keep it out of the pictures especially if it is as cheap and ugly as you described.", "NTA - I also just want to point out that I have never once gotten back something I have lent out - the item always ended up going missing, lost, or damaged.", "NTA. I think it was trivial though. Also, aren't the \"borrowed\" and the \"blue\" things supposed to be separate? She borrows one thing, the rest are her own things?", "NTA. *...there are many like it, but this one's mine*.\n\nThat sentence is part of the US's rifleman's creed, but I do feel it captures the sentimentality we sometimes have for mundane objects - it's not the object itself that is special, but the time spent with it that gives the item its uniqueness. \n\nSo even if it was cheap and technically replaceable, it isn't really so I wouldn't feel bad about not wanting to lend it out.\n\nI'd say a mild asshole on the other side because there shouldn't be a need to argue no over a lending that really wasn't needed and last minute but they did drop it.", "Thank you for your reply! She didn\u2019t want to wear it, just have it on her somehow, like tied around her bouquet (at the back cause it isn\u2019t very pretty haha) or around the strap of her shoe because the dress would cover it. And no offence taken. When I go out somewhere and dress up I don\u2019t wear it I keep it in my bra", "I think because it would have hit both blue and borrowed, and maybe old if you count > 1 year old lol", "This! I lost it once while on a road trip with my fianc\u00e9e (fell out of my bra in a servo toilet)- we went back and it put us an hour out. I cried the whole time until I had it back in my hands.", "Nope, I bought it from SHEIN myself. It has absolutely no value and isn\u2019t a family heirloom!", "This is a fair perspective. But I don\u2019t think so. I very rarely wear the necklace when I am dressing up for anything nice, especially a wedding. That\u2019s usually when I have it in my bra (which I always need to wear haha!) while I wear it almost 24/7, when it comes to events etc, I take it off.", "I thought as much too but given she\u2019d never cared about it until the day before\u2026.", "yeah it would definitely get lost and ngl the foot option is gross.", "Be careful with Shein stuff, a lot of their products have dangerous levels of lead", "You are absolutely NTA. But why is the ring sentimental?", "Because I wear it constantly and fiddle it when I\u2019m anxious, the metal has became really thin. To the point I actually bought a replacement that does look better but I can\u2019t bring myself to put it on. So I\u2019m just very careful with it now.", "This is a valid question. I didn\u2019t really want to answer but, it was something I shared with someone else. We had similar rings which we were both going through really hard times.", "You can probably have the ring reshanked - I'm not saying it's \"worth it\" monetarily, but if this costume ring is important to you, so long as the metal will hold a solder spot well, it's not a big deal to do for a jeweler who is well versed in laser solder repairs. Not everyone will work on costume because it can be fussy & tbh the metal alloys aren't always accurately represented, but I'm a sentimental, and although we primarily work with precious metals at my shop, we do a fair amount of sentimental costume repair as well. \n\nAnother thought - what about resetting the blue stone in a sterling setting with a heavier shank? I can't imagine there would be much of a price difference, and then you'll have something a bit more sturdy.\n\nYou're NTA, and I hope you can fix or find a suitable replacement for your everyday fidget piece - I know that can be harder than it sounds!", "Wow thank you for those ideas! I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth getting it reshanked, but the blue stone in sterling silver might actually work really well. I did buy a replacement ring (same price lol) that I know I could put on the chain but this specific piece feels very sentimental. However i could possible discard the band (and the smaller stones that surround the large one (on either side of the bank) and re set the main stone and have it carry the same sentimentality. Thanks again!", "If you'd like to send a few photos of the piece, I work on things like this on a regular basis - there might be a way to even inlay the original band into a heavier Sterling band. \n\nI saw lower down that this is a Shein purchase, and just out of an abundance of caution - *a lot* of VERY modern costume made overseas has significant amounts of lead in the alloy mixture - it's not supposed to, but it does. I'm not sure what happened that this has become such a rampant issue again, but the same is true of 70s costume, but that was moreso a not realizing it wasn't great to be touching your skin directly & regularly issue. \n\nHonestly, you can find or make pieces in sterling instead in the $5-50 fashion range, including estate of course, and it's genuinely a safer option than a lot of modern costume. If it's not precious metals, try for steel, and avoid costume fabricated overseas from fast fashion brands - they tend to be the worst offenders with the lead in the alloy issues. \n\nIf I can help or point you in the direction of a trusted colleague in your area, I'm happy to, just shoot me a message with some clear pics (flat on a white piece of paper with decent lighting - so like on a kitchen table or something is ideal).", "Thank you so much. I will message you for sue. I never expected to become this attached to something that is so cheap and low quality but alas, it became very special to me"]}
