I rent a 2BHK apartment near my office. I plan to share it with someone. \n\nMeanwhile, my cousin, Ava (F18) got admission into a college in my city. She is from my hometown too. Ava hates dorms. And want to stay in a apartment. \n\nHer parents, knowing I reside here and has a 2BHK rented, has asked me to let her stay with me. They will pay half the rent and utilities. But I don't want her moving in with me. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I love this kid and is very close with her family. She is basically my little sister. But I have the following concerns :\n\n1)If she is here, I will be expected to share everything, without reimbursement. She is basically my little sister. Asking money on pizza, or outings or eating out won't be possible since she is just a student. Her parents might share stuff like rent and utilities, but I can't ask and they won't offer any money for extra stuff. Realistically, they might give her money. But since I am her older working sister and knowing her she will never offer to cover her share. She will just ask for extra stuff and expect it to be given to her. \n\n2) I will have to take her wherever I go. I won't be just able to go hang with friends leaving her alone all the time. I will have to afford to pay for her too whenever I decide to do anything. \n\n3) She is a teenager. She talks back a lot. I have never seen her handle any responsibilty. It will be like raising a child to me, since I would either have to do all chores myself or make her do her part. Neither is appealing to me. \n\n4) At the end of the day, if anything goes wrong in anyway, her parents will blame me. For not looking after her. \n\nDue to these, I refused. I told them I have a friend I already promised who can move in. \n\nNow my family is saying I am a AH for choosing a stranger over family and not letting my cousin move in. My cousin is calling me an AH cause I am her only option since her parents won't let her get apartment with any friends and she hates dorms. \n\nAITA ?", "created_utc": 1693057411, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/161vm3y/aita_for_not_wanting_to_share_an_apartment_with/", "score": 369, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She needs to not live with you so she can grow up and figure out what you know (how to be independent).

Because ALL the reasons you've listed. This is you freedom apartment. Dont ruin it sharing it with family members. You will not be her big sister, but her mother.

Living in a dorm for a year - and learning to handle roommates, different personalities and beliefs, and responsibilities sounds like EXACTLY what this little princess needs, and you have quite accurately assessed how the situation would shake out.\n\nMy only recommendation would be don't say you have a friend moving in if you don't really have that.  Learning to be an adult means learning to stand up for your wishes and desires, even when others disagree.

She can be failing exams and demand designer bags and clothes. To her middle class parents. \n\n2) She demands or sweet talks everyone into gifts. I kinda think it's awesome how much she can get away with. She has come into my home and complained to my grandmother we should stock more snacks. That's not her grandmother \ud83d\ude02 and she visits twice a year or so. \n\n3) She sweet talks our uncle into taking her out cause her parents won't. Where she goes, she has no qualms asking for treats and fancy stuff. She legit asked my SIL to buy her cake once. It was not birthday or anything special whatsoever. And she didn't ask for one piece. She legit asked for a cake just so. And SIL gave her. With additional chocolates. \n\n4) She answers every question and statement with \"So?\". It's a never ending stream of \"So\"s that we cannot communicate with her normally. I said that attitude is disrespectful and I don't like it. She legit burst into tears and had whole family on my case. \ud83d\ude02\n\nAnd cherry on cake? She is her mom's princess. Her mom finds faults with every other kid in my generation but her. Trust me, one word about her and  she will make me the witch. \n\nSo with this history, with all love I have for her, no. I don't want to take responsibility for her. I don't want to discuss her with her parents.

That's no way to begin life on your own as a young adult. I can understand your family's disappointment because to them you are a wonderful solution to your \"sister's\" housing needs, but surely they can understand that a young woman of 24 would prefer to share her living situation with a peer who is at a similar point in life, not someone 6 years her junior.

It isn't going to work, and you already promised that friend, so....\n\nIf you feel better about it, offer to pick her and her roommate up for lunch and a tour of the college town.

Stand your ground.", "NTA\n\nDorms are part of the college experience, which is why many colleges require students to live in one for the first year at the very least. \n\nYou'd hate to deprive her of the friendships and experiences that will help form her character moving into adulthood.", "The best thing you can do is ignore them. Completely. \n\nIn a month or so, your cousin will be situated in a dorm or somewhere. The family will stfu eventually, even your cousins parents will have to accept reality.\n\nWhile they're all fuming and gossiping, you'll be happily ignoring them. Reading a book, watching TV, going about your life.\n\nHave a nice life. \u262e\ufe0f", "I'm not a fan of lies in general, and I want people to use their words.\n\nIt's not unreasonable for you to refuse to be a \"stupidvisor,\" to use a term from Bar Rescue's Jon Taffer.  A stupidvisor is someone who has responsibility without authority.  You would be expected to supervise this 18-year-old without having any actual authority over her.\n\nI would rather you be honest with them and simply accept that they won't like it.  But honestly, the kid's reaction to this proves that she would be a terrible roommate: \"My cousin is calling me an AH cause I am her only option since her parents won't let her get apartment with any friends and she hates dorms.\"  First of all, her \"hating\" dorms does not mean they are not an option.  It means that she doesn't like college dorms based on her experience of high school dorms (which is ridiculously shortsighted).  But the more important truth here is that she is calling you an AH because you made a decision that she did not like.  That does not bode well for living with you, so even if you were so inclined, her reaction *here* means that she's not ready for adult life.\n\nQED NTA\n\nBut seriously, consider just telling her family the truth.  You have made a logical, smart argument for why this won't work *for you* even if it's better *for her,* and she (and her fam) cannot expect you to take on a financial and emotional burden just as you're getting your own place for the first time just for their convenience.", "> They will pay half the rent and utilities.\n\nWhy not tell them to pay more?  I mean it's heavy busy for your cousin to deal with.   You don't need to take care of her cus she's already adult.  She is on her own.  She will make her own mistakes without you.  What make you think you are her responsible even she's adult???? Fuck that.  I mean that's what independence looks like.   Not understanding why you are upset or mad...  You just leave around. That's it.\n\nNAH", "Oh, worse.  They would pay the rent.  Not a penny more--nothing for food, going-out money, or anything else--but they would pay the rent, and any other requests would be the OP being \"cheap.\"", "Still fair, your folks should not be okay with turning down friends over \u2018family\u2019 just for the sake of it. They should acknowledge that you\u2019re friends are just as important.", "Exactly. Op said she would be required to buy all food and pay for anything else. That's not right.", "It's way better to just avoid the entire fight than fight to win everyday. They might guarantee expenses like rent and utilities. Maybe even groceries. \n\nBut snacks? Pizza? Eating out? They might just say don't do that. They don't buy her anything like that and thinks it's wasteful. I am not getting money from parents for that. What's the other option? Sneak snacks n food into my room? Eat without her? Pretty sure that would hurt her feelings even more and make entire family call me AH. \n\nLeaving her home also means an easy line for my parents to check what I do. And they won't be pleased with me hangout out either. Not to mention safety issues, risk of her doing anything that would make me culprit for not noticing. Too big a risk. \n\nI can fight day and night she is a adult and need to care for herself, fend for herself and keep herself safe. But it wouldn't matter. I would be labelled the selfish kid who doesn't love her sister and let harm befall her. \n\nI think it's about picking battles. This one i  know can save me from a million issues later on."]}
