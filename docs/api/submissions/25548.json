I rent a 2BHK apartment near my office. I plan to share it with someone. \n\nMeanwhile, my cousin, Ava (F18) got admission into a college in my city. She is from my hometown too. Ava hates dorms. And want to stay in a apartment. \n\nHer parents, knowing I reside here and has a 2BHK rented, has asked me to let her stay with me. They will pay half the rent and utilities. But I don't want her moving in with me. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I love this kid and is very close with her family. She is basically my little sister. But I have the following concerns :\n\n1)If she is here, I will be expected to share everything, without reimbursement. She is basically my little sister. Asking money on pizza, or outings or eating out won't be possible since she is just a student. Her parents might share stuff like rent and utilities, but I can't ask and they won't offer any money for extra stuff. Realistically, they might give her money. But since I am her older working sister and knowing her she will never offer to cover her share. She will just ask for extra stuff and expect it to be given to her. \n\n2) I will have to take her wherever I go. I won't be just able to go hang with friends leaving her alone all the time. I will have to afford to pay for her too whenever I decide to do anything. \n\n3) She is a teenager. She talks back a lot. I have never seen her handle any responsibilty. It will be like raising a child to me, since I would either have to do all chores myself or make her do her part. Neither is appealing to me. \n\n4) At the end of the day, if anything goes wrong in anyway, her parents will blame me. For not looking after her. \n\nDue to these, I refused. I told them I have a friend I already promised who can move in. \n\nNow my family is saying I am a AH for choosing a stranger over family and not letting my cousin move in. My cousin is calling me an AH cause I am her only option since her parents won't let her get apartment with any friends and she hates dorms. \n\nAITA ?", "created_utc": 1693057411, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/161vm3y/aita_for_not_wanting_to_share_an_apartment_with/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This would be a step back from you where you are at your current juncture.\n\nThrow parental clich\u00e9s back at them: Powering through the dorms builds your cousin's character.

In the future when she's more responsible then have this discussion again in a couple years so leave it on the hook as a future option to keep the peace (provided she has her own supplement income) college is a big deal to experience and you being her safety net isn't a good thing for her either", "NTA\n\nEdit: That's a huge responsibility to place on you.

Quite frankly, I would not want to live with an 18 year old either.  You have valid concerns about what would likely happen based on your experience with her.  Your home is your sanctuary so do not let the pressure force you to do something you do not want to do.  If your cousin has never lived in a dorm she really does not know what it is like.  She can try it out and if she hates it then she can look for an apartment herself.  The people that are telling you that you are the AH are being manipulative and are definately the AH's.", "NTA.

That's a necessity for most people who can't afford shit on their own.  Sacrifices must be made, and she sounds like a spoiled brat.
