It really is controlling behavior and should be shut down right quick!", "I\u2019m trying not to generalise- I\u2019m older than him- but it could be he\u2019s threatened by your choice and believes women need to conform to the male belief that women should wear clothes that are feminine and sexualise you.  His own manhood is threatened. It\u2019s an age thing rather than a you thing. \n\nWear what you want. I too find the more boys type underwear more comfortable.", "OF COURSE this is an age gap relationship.   \n\n\nHe's the asshole, not you. Wear what makes you comfortable, and tell him he seriously needs to change his attitude.", "A lot of issues here. For one, underwear doesn't determine your gender. And saying so is absurd. You can wear whatever you want and he has to get over it or leave. That's life.\n\nYour boyfriend sounds deeply insecure if someone wearing clothing that traditionally goes with another gender \"makes him uncomfortable.\" Especially because feminine people wearing masculine clothing has been considered socially acceptable for a really long time. Even if it was outside the norm, he's still wrong. You should wear whatever makes you comfortable, obviously. But hell, Carrie Bradshaw wore men's underwear on Sex and the City in the early 2000s and it was considered sexy.\n\nI would be concerned about your boyfriend's close-minded views on gender. And, throwing away your partner's property is considered abusive. At best it shows a complete lack of respect. And he's lying to you which should also be a deal breaker. NTA obviously.", "You came to reddit to ask for relationship advice hahaha \ud83d\ude06", "First off, huge age difference. Since OP mentioned ages, I can't help but comment on them.\n\nSecondly, how can your choice in underwear make you an asshole? Maybe if your underwear had something very offensive written on it, and you insisted on wearing it in public wearing it and nothing else.....", "No. You're not an asshole for having an underwear preference. Ladies underwear is designed to give men boners, not be comfortable for women. It's only natural for some of you to break the norm. \n\nNow... you ARE an asshole for using pronouns. Normal people without mental illnesses do not need to announce who they are around people. That's super weird. Nobody is required to participate in your self delusion. Also, you're not a \"they\". That implies you are more than one person, and DEFINITELY suffering from mental illness.", "Molly meldrum had the best response when someone asked \"who do you wear women's clothes\" and they replied, \"they're not women's clothes, they're mine, I bought them\"\n\nBuy and use whatever products work better. \nMen's razors also usually have more blades and are cheaper too. \nMy wife uses the same razor as me. \nI wouldn't care if she wore boxers, she buys hoodie in the men's section too so they're big and comfy. \nShe buys men's track pants because they always actually have pockets.\n\nDo your thing OP", "NTA\n\nI've been wearing boxer briefs for years. Your boyfriend is givng out so many red flags though...like one giant red flag!", "Main reason older men date young women is control. They usually can control younger women financially and emotionally. \n\nHe's annoyed you don't do what he wants. \n\nYour relationship will end anyway if you don't bend to his will. This is not mutually respectful and balanced partnership to start with. \n\nNTA of course.", "Nothing wrong with wearing 'mens' under wear point 1. The bigger problem is not the age gap, love who you want to love, he is being disrespectful and you don't seem to be seeing it. You spoken about it, he didn't like you answer so instead of a) talking about again  b) looking at himself as to why it makes him uncomfortable c) realising you're an adult who can make their own choices went with d) trying to say wearing 'mens' underwear will 'make you trans' and 'stress you out'. So the unhinged option. Is this really the only thing that he tries to control what you do? NTA", "Yep, this is spot on. You are not alone with liking that type of underwear. A company called Woxer makes them for women. Wear what you like and dump the old dude!", "Dude isn't middle aged. He's nearly a senior citizen.", "Thanks. Saved me a bunch of typing.", ">NTA I love mens underwear. Its so much softer and roomier! They need to stop branding clothes by gender imo. Underwear are inanimate objects\u2026  why do they have gender?? Your boyfriend shouldnt be compromising your comfort just because of the skewed lens he sees life through.\n\nThere is a reason some of the clothing is labeled, like a shorts made for bicycle riding.... one has room for dangly bits hanging out, the other does not....  \nI know a guy that got the wrong one by mistake :D\n\nOther than that.... people should just wear what they want to:)", "\\*facepalms\\* I'm afraid to ask, but can't resist: how many times have you tried to talk a guy into wearing a lacy thong?", "He does sound trans phobic with lots of \ud83d\udea9.  He has an expectation of what women wear, putting you in a box.", "this. if he\u2019s THAT old dating a 28 year old\u2026 guy\u2019s a creep and a loser. NTA op. dump him, and go buy some more boxers", "The rule of thumb for whether an age difference in a relationship is creepy: Take the oldest person's age, divide it by two, and then add 7. The younger person should be at least this old.\n\n(52/2)+7 = 33.5. Yeah, 33.5 > 28.", ">many girls say they wear mens boxers \n\nand this has been true for decades.", "I agree with the underwear thing, if it was JUST about underwear...but OP also said she 'sometimes uses different pronouns'.  I think THAT's more the concern for the boyfriend, he's just focusing on underwear because it's likely something he feels he 'understands' and if she just stops wearing them, she wont' be confused about her gender.  I think OP needs to figure some stuff out.", "Yes, they do. I have some really cute ones and they are soooo comfortable but still pretty.", "Actually, *one* year ago, even though they've been together for a few years. This post is definitely fake. (Or being posted on behalf of a friend to try to convince them to break up with their gross boyfriend, if I wanna give OP the benefit of the doubt.)", "Googled it.   \nThey're just good old \"grandma's drawers\" ;)", "No. At 53 you\u2019re far from being a senior. People nowadays live up to 80+ years, especially in developed countries. So 53 is pretty much middle aged.", "He\u2019s not even close, he\u2019s middle age", "Thanks. F53. \ud83d\ude1e", "Well not a Lacy thong, but a dude I knew liked to wear my cotton bikinis for biking", "My friend have had a shop with underwear.   \nShe had one male customer, who was always buying silk camisoles for himself.", "That rule is ridiculous, all you need to know if it\u2019s creepy is common sense. \n\nOver a decade is always weird and when you\u2019re younger the gap needs to be even smaller. \n\nIf you need a formula to figure it out I don\u2019t even know what to say.", "That\u2019s an amazing rule\u2026 just did a bunch of different ages in my head and compared with my friends that are dating/married\u2026 ima use this in the future", "I thought so, I figured I might not be in the same country as OP, but an ex of mine def wore them"]}
