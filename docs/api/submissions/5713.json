This may be coloring every experience you have, and hopefully family therapy can help\u2026 but it\u2019s not really about gifts. Perhaps you could try to be the bigger person, try to be more open hearted and focus more on the bond you two share. Life is so short.

Everyone should be treated equally.", "I like to read other comments before answering to see what I assume is a grouping of people who are more your peers.  I am much older then you and can only see through my own lens of childhood.  I think if I grew up similar to you, I\u2019d probably feel the bitterness of unfairness, but sucked it up because of the power dynamics of the times.  Advocating for yourself to a parent was something you didn\u2019t do.\nToday that has changed.  And in your case, you every right to express your observation of their preferential treatment.  And offering to have the gifts distributed to others wasn\u2019t taking away from anyone else.  But what really got me was someone (an adult?) texting you-a child (sorry) and saying you \u201cruined\u201d Christmas.

Interesting how they are calling you ungrateful when you're the one not accepting the gifts they are giving. They are not treating you equally to your siblings, you set fair boundaries and kept them. By not accepting the gifts you showed that it's not about the value, it's about the sentiment, and you are receiving far less than anyone else in that household. Good on you!", "NTA. Take them, still wrapped, to a homeless shelter or older kids\u2019 group home.", "nta. there's definitely purpose behind not giving you the same value gifts as the other kids - otherwise why would they insist on getting you gifts even after you refused them and then be so upset when you refused to open them? if it were plain neglect they would leave it alone and let you refuse. it's an abuse tactic.", "INFO:\n\n>After some time my mom adopted them (which I hated)\n\nWhy?", "NTA. It's not about the gifts, it's about expectations of equal treatment. And you were already clear that you won't receive gifts anymore. I am hoping that your father isn't an AH.", "NTA .

Because if you are only comparing what you got from one parent to what they got from two, you're comparing apples and oranges.\n\nETA: YTA, you get gifts from your father that you are completely ignoring here. I hope someday you look back on this and cringe at how you treat your mother. She is recognizing that you, not your steps, have other parents and gift givers. You seem to completely discount that your father cheated on your mother, then married his affair partner, AND you call the person who helped break up your parent's marriage \"mom.\" Of course she's mad about that! What a disgusting, unprincipled little brat you are!", "NTA\n\nOp, I know you like your school where you are at, but 2 years of living in that environment is not worth it.  It is not worth the mental illness the neglect that your mother is doing to you.  It is not worth it to watch as your mother favors her stepchildren over you.  Nor is it worth it when her parents and all of her family decide to harass and bully a child, that would be you.\n\nI think your best option would be to talk to your father about living with him full time and to not return there for a long while and put for the condition that any visitation is only with your mother and not with your mother, her husband and the other children.  \n\nNow there are several things here that I am thinking of and looking at.  One is the family therapist.  I think you need to be brutally honest infront of the therapist and from the sounds of it, that you are already checking out of the relationship.  That in 2 years you will no longer be in her life, will have nothing to do with her or her children or her husband or her family.  That to you they will be strangers and you don't want to know them or have them around.  \n\nThat is what is going to happen, you will turn 18 and one day will just leave her and she will never know what happened to you or be involved, that you intend to go NC with her for the rest of her natural life.  \n\nThe other thing and this is where you have to think long term and start planning and that is what happens if you get something nice from say your father?  Do they take it away or make you share it with the others?  You are a teenager, what if you get a car, what is to stop your mother or your stepfather from taking it away from you or trying to sell it and use the money on their children?  what if you get something nice and those kids want it, does this mean you have to give it up to them?  \n\nThose are the kinds of things that I think need to be answered.  And from what you posted, having it taken away from you or conditions put on it in favor of the 2 younger children kind of seem more likely.  \n\nAlso when you get a chance, talk to your father, you want to know about things like college funds and other stuff like that, which is in your name.  (Far too many posts where a child has a fund, and the stepparent steals or tries to take it from the child to fund their own child or tries to get the child to hand it over.)

More of a symptom of the problem not the main issues. I'd say you are well within your rights to refuse being treated as a second class citizen in your own home. I would write down in as non Blamey as you can, your gripes. Definitely mind the wording. Something akin to \"look we are all equal or we aren't. I respect that you guys have a family going on here but if I'm a second class citizen here then I don't want to accept gifts and accept my lot in this, it's akin to accepting the situation here. I love and appreciate you guys, but I don't want to be part of this if I am being treated differently than my \"siblings\".

I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re being treated this way. You made it clear you don\u2019t want anything and now they\u2019re trying to make you the asshole here instead of acknowledging their asshole behavior.

Your mom could have respected your wishes, or gotten you gifts and privately offered them to you, or otherwise found a way to try to apologize that wasn't painting you as the bad guy. \n\nUnsolicited advice - try to remember that as much as this situation sucks, your step-sibs are also kids and not any more responsible for your mom's behavior than you are. You can hate the situation, but unless they're also jerks, try not to take it out on them-- which you probably aren't, you sound remarkably mature about a bad situation, and also don't take that to mean you ALSO have to cater to them or anything, just worth keeping in mind.", "NTA\n\nyou are justified in your reaction but I would use this as a way of broaching the subject about equality again. Your mum obviously expected you to forget about the past inequality and be a greedy teenager, but you held your will and didn\u2019t accept the presents. This is a perfect opportunity to sit down with her now she knows you\u2019re serious.

Continue treating you like a second hand child will cause you to drift away from her.", "NTA - If you were significantly older than them, I could see the justification, as gift spending will inevitably go down as you get older... but there's literally 4 years between you and the youngest. That's hardly anything in the grand scheme of things!\n\nIt is absolutely not unreasonable then to expect that you'd be treated the same as them, but it seems your Mum is prioritising her new children, and taking you for granted.\n\nThey're only upset now that you've refused to keep playing doll house and made them look bad in front of the relatives.", "NTA.

I kept having to teach basic psychology (and economics) to a bunch of women who were already parents and should have known this already.  Many tried to argue that the kids wouldn't notice.

Thats when therapy started and it's not helping. It's probably too late now.

Everyone on my mom's side denies any favoritism but I'm not blind.\n\nI must say that I snoop on my dads phone (bad, I know) and I learned a lot of things that are happening behind the scenes. I think my mom resents me for calling my stepmom mom and my mom's husband by his name. My mom hates my stepmom because she had affair with my dad and now thinks she is stealing me too.

As far as I am concerned I already lost my mom, but got a new one.", "I am sure the only thing my mom considers is to put all on my dad and his family.

Also, write down in a notebook all the times when favoritism has been noted, along with your feelings at that moment, it is something a friend did in a similar situation and it helped her a lot.

So maybe it's both parents paying for your adopted sisters things and your mom paying for yours? Just another way to look at it.
