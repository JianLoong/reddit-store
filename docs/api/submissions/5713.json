Everyone should be treated equally.", "I like to read other comments before answering to see what I assume is a grouping of people who are more your peers.  I am much older then you and can only see through my own lens of childhood.  I think if I grew up similar to you, I\u2019d probably feel the bitterness of unfairness, but sucked it up because of the power dynamics of the times.  Advocating for yourself to a parent was something you didn\u2019t do.\nToday that has changed.  And in your case, you every right to express your observation of their preferential treatment.  And offering to have the gifts distributed to others wasn\u2019t taking away from anyone else.  But what really got me was someone (an adult?) texting you-a child (sorry) and saying you \u201cruined\u201d Christmas.

Interesting how they are calling you ungrateful when you're the one not accepting the gifts they are giving. They are not treating you equally to your siblings, you set fair boundaries and kept them. By not accepting the gifts you showed that it's not about the value, it's about the sentiment, and you are receiving far less than anyone else in that household. Good on you!", "NTA. Take them, still wrapped, to a homeless shelter or older kids\u2019 group home.", "nta. there's definitely purpose behind not giving you the same value gifts as the other kids - otherwise why would they insist on getting you gifts even after you refused them and then be so upset when you refused to open them? if it were plain neglect they would leave it alone and let you refuse. it's an abuse tactic.", "INFO:\n\n>After some time my mom adopted them (which I hated)\n\nWhy?", "NTA. It's not about the gifts, it's about expectations of equal treatment. And you were already clear that you won't receive gifts anymore. I am hoping that your father isn't an AH.", "NTA .

Because if you are only comparing what you got from one parent to what they got from two, you're comparing apples and oranges.\n\nETA: YTA, you get gifts from your father that you are completely ignoring here. I hope someday you look back on this and cringe at how you treat your mother. She is recognizing that you, not your steps, have other parents and gift givers. You seem to completely discount that your father cheated on your mother, then married his affair partner, AND you call the person who helped break up your parent's marriage \"mom.\" Of course she's mad about that! What a disgusting, unprincipled little brat you are!", "NTA\n\nOp, I know you like your school where you are at, but 2 years of living in that environment is not worth it.  It is not worth the mental illness the neglect that your mother is doing to you.  It is not worth it to watch as your mother favors her stepchildren over you.  Nor is it worth it when her parents and all of her family decide to harass and bully a child, that would be you.\n\nI think your best option would be to talk to your father about living with him full time and to not return there for a long while and put for the condition that any visitation is only with your mother and not with your mother, her husband and the other children.  \n\nNow there are several things here that I am thinking of and looking at.  One is the family therapist.  I think you need to be brutally honest infront of the therapist and from the sounds of it, that you are already checking out of the relationship.  That in 2 years you will no longer be in her life, will have nothing to do with her or her children or her husband or her family.  That to you they will be strangers and you don't want to know them or have them around.  \n\nThat is what is going to happen, you will turn 18 and one day will just leave her and she will never know what happened to you or be involved, that you intend to go NC with her for the rest of her natural life.  \n\nThe other thing and this is where you have to think long term and start planning and that is what happens if you get something nice from say your father?  Do they take it away or make you share it with the others?  You are a teenager, what if you get a car, what is to stop your mother or your stepfather from taking it away from you or trying to sell it and use the money on their children?  what if you get something nice and those kids want it, does this mean you have to give it up to them?  \n\nThose are the kinds of things that I think need to be answered.  And from what you posted, having it taken away from you or conditions put on it in favor of the 2 younger children kind of seem more likely.  \n\nAlso when you get a chance, talk to your father, you want to know about things like college funds and other stuff like that, which is in your name.  (Far too many posts where a child has a fund, and the stepparent steals or tries to take it from the child to fund their own child or tries to get the child to hand it over.)

And as for the only one vacation, if you think taking one vacation per year with the whole family justifies purposely excluding OP from all other vacations they take during the year, then I think you might be OP's mom, because no one with empathy would think that's acceptable.", "I agree. After reading just the op, I was completely 100% on his side. But his responses here shed a different light on the situation. They welcomed him, wanted to be his stepfather and siblings but he refused by saying terrible things to them. Only after that, after he decided to ignore them and shit on their feelings, they started to neglect him. He also never said, who pays for the gifts. Is it his stepfather, who he never cared to build a relationship with? Go to your dad kid and stay there, let your mom, stepfather and step-siblings get some peace.", "He admits that he traumatized little kids who had lost their mom. It\u2019s gross.", "Man you really have it in for this kid.", "Or maybe to make up for the fact that OP has to watch his stepsiblings get gifts from their dad, his grandparents, and his mom's extended family (all of whom give OP nothing) in addition to the better gifts they get from his own mom.", "The affair is about adults...not the kid", "True! If possible! Or how about family therapy to teach parents the benefits of fairness?", "I went to 3 high schools (military family); it was hard but I got involved in school activities and made friends. And that was before cell phones and social media!  Move to your dads house where you will be treated with the love and respect you deserve.", "I keep seeing people using the 'reverse victims' tactic on this sub and it's heartbreaking. Like as if OP has to pretend this ruse is all well and good, with no pain, or be branded the villain. The family falls in line as enforcers. NTA and I hope OP can live on their own as soon as possible.", "I was wondering the same about you.", "Well is the money the new husband\u2019s or hers? Maybe the mum only has that much to spend? Also, OP is getting gifts from two sets of parents, the kids are getting gifts from one. So is OP expecting to end up with twice as many presents as the new kids?", "The kid was like 9, not a teenager\u2026.", "yeah what\u2019s your point? pretty sure a \u201cfamily\u201d who cares less for a kid and throws a fit because they refuse to play with their game doesn\u2019t have to lie. angel or not you don\u2019t get treated like less than, you\u2019re either projecting or just being a jerk", "You said you\u2019re a mom, so you understand kids change over time, so you think this kid hasn\u2019t changed in over 8 years?", "Excellent point. Then he\u2019d have been here asking \u201cAITA because I asked for no gifts and my family listened to me?\u201d", "If the OP is with his father for the Summer (for example) then his mom shouldn\u2019t go on vacation then?  Or any other time the OP is with his Dad?  It\u2019s not like they\u2019re leaving him home alone.\n\nMy issue with this kid is his entitlement complex.  He has given no or very little indication that there is favoritism at play here other than the gifts and vacations and furniture - which we have no idea what that even means.  Nine is old enough not to say something so horrible to another kid that, by his own admission, it caused them trauma.  It\u2019s very easy for him to complain about the family he spends the most time with - you know, the ones who are doing the daily grind, day in and day out - while spending all the fun time with the other family.  The fact he can\u2019t see that is part of the problem.", "Since mom and stepdad have no part in providing what OP gets at his dad's house they should not get to use the value to offset their gifts.", "True enough, but my point is that the OP is fine to call step-mother \u201cmom\u201d but not step-father \u201cdad\u201d?  but cites no reason why other than he simply didn\u2019t like that his mother re-married.  Apparently he puts rules on his mom that his dad does not need to follow.", "When your family Xmas is like Global Thermonuclear War...", "So do you still think OP is the ah?", "What the other set of parents give OP isn't really relevant, though, because all they're asking for is equality from the one set.", "Yes, and I can give him a little bit of a pass for his initial reactions, but apparently he never changed his attitude or behavior, and now he\u2019s 16 and surprised that things are strained?\n\nHe also says that he\u2019s spoken to his mother about this issue and she\u2019s explained things to him but he doesn\u2019t like her explanations, so he\u2019s decided he\u2019d rather be a brat instead.  He hasn\u2019t told us what those \u201cexcuses\u201d are so how are we to know if they\u2019re valid?  I mean I\u2019m sorry, but only a brat says, \u201cIf I can\u2019t have what I want, then I want nothing at all!\u201d", "But kid is fine calling dad\u2019s new wife \u201cmom\u201d, even though she\u2019s the woman dad had an affair with\u2026", "He did say \" don't really have a relationship\" with them . Also that he said hurtful and traumatic things to the kids. That's not twisting anything", "So if the girls are getting gifts from their father and adopted mother= 2 parents paying for those gifts\nOP says they get gifts from mom and stepfather that are worth half what those same adults get for the girls. So...that half is moms equal contribution to all 3 of her kids' gifts, right? \nIn addition,  OP gets additional gifts from his father and stepmother (who he favors and calls mom over his own mother) . I mean at some point in life, OP will have to learn that you can't just treat people like trash and still expect them to give you everything you want", "The OP is the one who chose to be a brat and not open gifts which were given to him.  He placed an UNFAIR ultimatum upon them.  He was basically threatening them to get his way.  \u201cGive me what I want or give me nothing at all\u201d is an a-hole move no matter how you slice it.", "Well he still won\u2019t call step-father \u201cdad\u201d and sounds like he\u2019s still resentful over the whole remarriage, and says he still has no relationship with his step-siblings on that side, so yeah, it sounds like he hasn\u2019t put much effort into changing his attitude.", "Is your mom and her family aware  that you plan on cutting them out of your life for good? I don't see how they think what they're doing is right and fair.", "Your dad doesn\u2019t \u201chave to\u201d do anything. Your entitlement is over the top.", "So you prefer the man who had an affair.  If you aren\u2019t getting gifts from other members of your mother\u2019s family, then perhaps you should examine why that is.  Perhaps you\u2019ve been just as bratty to them as you have been to your mother, step-father, and step-siblings.  If things are \u201ctense\u201d then it\u2019s likely due to YOUR behavior.", "Yes...I agree something is missing", "I switched schools in my sophomore year of highschool weird at first but it was a great experience. Do whatever feels best OP!", "And they just keep calling you even though you took your phone off the hook.", "You know what's weird? Reddit has shown me that some moms actually try that! They cook with rotten stuff or allergens and still sob when kids refuse to eat their food. I never understood how people can know they're doing something bad yet they want others to act like nothing is wrong.", "Absolutely.", "The 16yr old has Christmas at TWO houses and gets plenty of gifts!  I am mind-boggled that people aren\u2019t seeing how entitled this kid is acting.", "How isn\u2019t it? New siblings get presents from mum and dad, as does OP. Only OP seems to expect the same amount of presents from one parent compared to two. And we don\u2019t know if the money comes from mum\u2019s husband or mum", "Explained that they get better gifts because their Mom died isn\u2019t a valid excuse. She is their Mom, she is just using that orphan stuff as an excuse to treat him like crap. How can a mother ever treat a child different from other kids is beyond me. You\u2019re the mother of two. If you married a man who\u2019s wife died, would you seriously treat his kids better than your own? Would you attend all of their games and shows but not your own child\u2019s? I mean this is beyond gifts. This \u201cmom\u201d hardly attends games and shows, and I bet it\u2019s because dad is going to be there.  That is what OP is going to remember, not the gifts, it will be the never supporting their activities. THAT is why OP is not the AH. As a Mom you should be disgusted with that.  I would be angry too\u2026 in fact I still have issues because my Mom hardly came to any of my ball games, that is what I remember.", "Sure. Probably because step mom never forced it and it happened naturally. Especially because OP\u2019s mom seems more into the new family than OP, but that\u2019s just a guess.", "Are you conveniently forgetting the grandparents?", "Op said 'treat me equally'. They still are not so he's checked out.", "that\u2019s not an ultimatum, OP said if you can\u2019t treat me equally don\u2019t give me anything at all. what does OP gain nothing", "Are your parents divorced? Have you ever been through a similar situation. Kids all handle things differently. I bet there is a reason why he resents his step dad, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not all about the kids. I bet something was said, something telling, something no one would believe OP about. It still isn\u2019t an excuse to give less and not show up for your kid. \u201cHey old kid, we\u2019re not giving you an equal amount of love because my kids don\u2019t have a mom anymore and you have a dad and another step mom. You already have more you don\u2019t need to be loved as much as these half orphan kids.\u201d That\u2019s what it boils down too. The half orphans get more love than broken home kid because broken home gets two homes. That\u2019s messed up.", "My mom's family hates me because of my dad. I don't want to tell my mom because there will be drama.", "They hate my dad and are punishing me for his mistakes because I have his blood in my veins and look like him. It started even before mom met her husband. They are doing this to hurt me because they know this is their only way to hurt my dad.", "Found the Mom", "So you know this kid\u2026 you must be step dad?", "It's the victim complex.

He feels under appreciated, like they \u201chave\u201d to give him something vs they want to give him something. All kids should be valued equally from the beginning if you give siblings be iPhones and op a $20 track phone that makes him feel undervalued and then they get mad because he doesn\u2019t appreciate the cheap phone. If he was acting out in the beginning then it should have been a sign to help him, not treat him different.", "Their concern was about their step-siblings getting more gifts,  which could extend to birthday presents as well.

I assume they do mean higher value as well. \nBut you are right, OP is going to two Christmas' so OP could be getting the same number,  just spread out over both families. \n\nThis doesn't address their feelings of less attention though", "Because they're two separate families? It's not OP's fault that they don't have two sets of parents. Withholding gifts based on something OP can't control is really shitty. \n\nThink of it this way - let's say there are two brothers and they each marry someone and have kids. For one of them, the parents of their spouse died young.

He says he doesn\u2019t buy the excuses but we haven\u2019t been told what they are - a very valid one is that he\u2019s getting MORE presents at his Dad\u2019s house, so he\u2019s going to end up with equal or even more gifts.", "Actually it\u2019s a particularly conniving ultimatum because whatever his mom does, he\u2019d find fault with it.

He\u2019s no longer a \u201ckid\u201d in my opinion.  He\u2019s 16 and old enough to know that his behavior has consequences.

It likely took time for SM to gain trust with Op before he called her Mom. I\u2019m a mom of two also. And idk how my kids would be in this situation. I know I would be concerned with them more than anyone else until I knew they were ok with me dating. The way kids see moms is different than Dads and that has to be noted.

The kid flat out said he resented that his mom adopted his step-siblings and that he said such horrible things to them that he traumatized them - HIS words.", "Or OP is misreading normal interactions from a lens of resentment.  Also a possibility.", "No, he said in another post that he didn\u2019t like when his mother married his step-father and he said some horrible things to his step-siblings which left them traumatized (they had been excited for an older brother).

He's spent years watching his mother prioritise his siblings over him, his step dad not get him anything, his mother's family blame him for the sins of his father. He is stuck in a horrid situation and it must hurt him so much and he's still so young.\n\nEdit: nice edit\n\nHis treatment at his father's is not necessary to this as it is about his mother's. Whether he get 25 gifts or 1 at Dad's hasn't bearing on the fact that mum and stepdad should be treating him equally to their other children from the start"]}
