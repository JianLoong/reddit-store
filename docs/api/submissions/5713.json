Mom, her husband and grandparents came after me and told me how ungrateful I am and to just open the gifts. I argued with them, things were told, people were offended and I went to my room and locked it.\n\nI waited till my dad came and just sneak out of the house. I told dad what happened and he told me I should just open the gifts. I got some text from my mom's side how I ruined Christmas and made my mom cry. She texted me and begged me to come home.

Enough with their bullshit. Instead of the presents, imagine your mom and stepdad are serving you a disgusting soup every year. You taste it year one, you don\u2019t like it and it makes you sick. Next year, same. At this point, you know how the soup it\u2019s going to taste and how you\u2019re going to feel. No need to subject yourself to this experience. Your mom crying is really funny to me, and the fact that she says you\u2019re ruining Christmas by not tasting their disgusting soup is sick.", "NTA  You were clear in your expectations- you expected equal treatment, didn't recieve it and let them know you'd no longer tolerate it. It's a shame your mother allows and encourages this, do you live with her? Can you stay with your dad? And I'd point out that you didn't ruin anything - her treatment of you ruined things and I'd even ask her why she cares so much.", "NTA: You told your parents how you feel and they ignored you. Their inability to discuss this with you and come to an agreement is on them. Attempting to make you feel guilty for your feelings is dysfunctional.", "NTA. This is the result of years of mistreatment by your family.", "NTA but if you're not already in it, I'd look into therapy. You might also consider moving in with your Dad, even if you have to switch schools.", "NTA, blended families are ridiculously complicated and from the sounds of it you were never a fan to begin with.  However you let your mom know how it made you felt and she did not do enough (or anything) to rectify it.\n\nI can kind of see the very flawed logic as to why she did things the way they did.  If you have both your mother *and* your father so you have two sets to provide where their kids together only have them.  I call them their kids because she did adopt them.  However the blantent favoritism isn't exactly making them look very good", "NTA your mum needs a wake up call, she is going to loose her son but unfortunately i think its too late. Im sorry for you", "NTA - You could accept the gifts and sell them for cash. Because if you want to leave in 2 years,  you are going to need all the cash you can get. If  you can't sell them as they are not worth anything re-gift them back to your mom - husband and kids. If they complain - well if they were good enough for me they are good enough for you.", "NTA. They mistreated you. They \"ruined Christmas\" on their own by treating you differently and not listening to you when you voiced your concerns. You decided to no longer be put through that anymore and now they're mad.\n\nI will say, I'd open the gifts just to check if your mom/stepdad become better about the whole thing. But judging by their reaction to you not opening them, I don't think they did get better.", "Nta\n\nIf you hadn't told them ahead of time, maybe a tiny bit ah your way, but you told them very clearly that you were tired of the obvious favoritism, and rather than demand that they give you more, or give the kids less, you just said you want no part of the whole thing. They chose to ignore your wishes then were surprised, which they had no right to be. \n\nNext year, make it clear that you're just not going to see your mother on your birthday or Christmas.", "NTA The ugly sisters open their gifts and get wonderful presents and Cinderella opens hers and it is nothing like her step sister's gift. And everyone smirks and feels powerful and Cinderella feels humiliated and less than. But what if Cinderella doesn't open the present? Then no one has any power over her. She is the one with the power. My mother was a narscissist. She played loads of mind games, but I learnt to take back the power, just as you did there. Yes it hurts, it hurts bad. But you put yourself in the driving seat. You didn't ruin Christmas, you just drew a line in the sand. You just told them you are not putting up with the B.S anymore. It is hard to enforce that as a minor. good luck. Don't let people bully you into being the victim.", "NTA\n\nThey refused to listen. Not your fault.", "NTA. I hope you have a plan when you turn 18 and can move out.", "NTA.

I know changing schools can be hard but having a tough time at school but a calm peaceful home is way better than a happy school experience but a chaotic miserable home life.  \n\nYour mother has shown you time and time again she doesn't care about you.

How were they always favoured?", "Plot twist: they got you a PS5 this year.\n\nNTA anyway", "NTA. As a mom I don't understand the favoring other kids over your own(i do get loving them and treating them equally as your own). \n And you already complained about this issue but the response wasn't \"I'm not favoring them\" but \"I'm doing it because of this\". \nYou're still a kid as well and you have the right to be upset and wanting an equal treatment, attention and gifts value.", "NTA.

Every birthday and Christmas has made you feel less wanted. You're being called ungrateful for not letting them continue to mistreat you.\n\nThis is like trying to wrestle someone in a match where you have to play by normal rules but your opponent is allowed to kick you in the nuts, gouge your eyes, etc. There's no way for you to win.\n\nRefusing to play is the only sane option.\n\nHave you asked your mom what it would take for her to start treating you and your stepsiblings equally? How many times does she have to break your heart before she decides that you've suffered enough?

Sorry but you are kind of acting bratty. Your mom and step-dad got you less expensive gifts? Really? Gifts aren\u2019t love. Gifts are not always measured by much they cost. Also sometimes it is harder financially at different times of year. That\u2019s life. They did what they could and you didn\u2019t appreciate it then. They tried again and you marched out. You resent that your Mom adopted other kids. She probably had to try pretty hard for them to accept her and in that time you felt less close to her- but they can never ever take your place. It\u2019s just bad timing because a 16 year old girl really needs her Mom . This may be coloring every experience you have, and hopefully family therapy can help\u2026 but it\u2019s not really about gifts. Perhaps you could try to be the bigger person, try to be more open hearted and focus more on the bond you two share. Life is so short. You\u2019re upset because you need more from them but running off won\u2019t make that happen. Talk and be mature. Analyze where your feelings are coming from.

Their theory is that they are the only parents buying for your siblings and that you would get double the gifts of your siblings if they treated you all the same. \n\nBut...that is the AH thing to do. It's none of your siblings' business what you get from your dad and step mom.

My mom and her husband kind of show love through gifts and so the cost does show that I'm less than. But it's not just gifts, they always treat me less then. At this point I have more connection to my stepmom. She treats me the same as her own kids. I call her mom too, which my mom absolutely hates (I saw messages between my dad and mom.

OP details a lot of other behaviours that make the overall situation not okay, but at least with the gift-giving it sounds like OP has an issue with the accounting. OP gets twice as many gifts since he gets gifts from mom and then presumably again from dad. OP sees his step-siblings getting gifts that are twice as valuable, but they don\u2019t also have another parent contributing from off-screen. To me, the gift situation sounds fair overall and I think OP isn\u2019t seeing it that way. \n\nOf course my comment comes with the caveat that there\u2019s a lot more going on here than just gifts, but that\u2019s beyond the scope of the post.", "How did you figure? What OP is seeing as a discrepancy and\u201dunfair\u201d may just be stepdad spending money on the siblings (not mom) because mom may have an agreement with bio-dad that she spends on day-to-day bills and care, and he spends on the big ticket items.

I see where you're coming from but legally if the money was in a trust or whatever, there are rules for spending... it's worth OP at least asking IMO"]}
