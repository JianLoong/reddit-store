This may be coloring every experience you have, and hopefully family therapy can help\u2026 but it\u2019s not really about gifts.

I am much older then you and can only see through my own lens of childhood.  I think if I grew up similar to you, I\u2019d probably feel the bitterness of unfairness, but sucked it up because of the power dynamics of the times.  Advocating for yourself to a parent was something you didn\u2019t do.\nToday that has changed.  And in your case, you every right to express your observation of their preferential treatment.  And offering to have the gifts distributed to others wasn\u2019t taking away from anyone else.

I hope someday you look back on this and cringe at how you treat your mother. She is recognizing that you, not your steps, have other parents and gift givers.

It is not worth the mental illness the neglect that your mother is doing to you.  It is not worth it to watch as your mother favors her stepchildren over you.  Nor is it worth it when her parents and all of her family decide to harass and bully a child, that would be you.\n\nI think your best option would be to talk to your father about living with him full time and to not return there for a long while and put for the condition that any visitation is only with your mother and not with your mother, her husband and the other children.  \n\nNow there are several things here that I am thinking of and looking at.  One is the family therapist.  I think you need to be brutally honest infront of the therapist and from the sounds of it, that you are already checking out of the relationship.  That in 2 years you will no longer be in her life, will have nothing to do with her or her children or her husband or her family.  That to you they will be strangers and you don't want to know them or have them around.  \n\nThat is what is going to happen, you will turn 18 and one day will just leave her and she will never know what happened to you or be involved, that you intend to go NC with her for the rest of her natural life.  \n\nThe other thing and this is where you have to think long term and start planning and that is what happens if you get something nice from say your father?  Do they take it away or make you share it with the others?  You are a teenager, what if you get a car, what is to stop your mother or your stepfather from taking it away from you or trying to sell it and use the money on their children?  what if you get something nice and those kids want it, does this mean you have to give it up to them?  \n\nThose are the kinds of things that I think need to be answered.  And from what you posted, having it taken away from you or conditions put on it in favor of the 2 younger children kind of seem more likely.  \n\nAlso when you get a chance, talk to your father, you want to know about things like college funds and other stuff like that, which is in your name.  (Far too many posts where a child has a fund, and the stepparent steals or tries to take it from the child to fund their own child or tries to get the child to hand it over.)

Mom+stepdad DEFINITELY and most of all.\n\nOn the gift front, isolated from everything else, I see the logic in your mom and stepdad getting you less to balance with what you receive from your dad and his family and think that\u2019s fair under the right circumstances. I know people are divided on that\u2014some feel it shouldn\u2019t matter what\u2019s going on at the other parent\u2019s house, but on the other hand, if you received equal from mom + stepdad and then also got to come home with even MORE cool stuff from dad, we\u2019d have a situation where your step-siblings feel THEY are unequal. However, like I said, I think the logic is fair UNDER THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES\u2014mom and dad communicating as coparents and coming to an agreement on gifts, some of your presents from dad being sent over to mom\u2019s so that when your step-sibs get their big presents, you also get at least some of yours, etc. If they\u2019re going to make everything completely separate, then mom+stepdad should ensure that the gifts they get for all of their children are equal, because they don\u2019t know what is going on with dad. \n\nThey\u2019re also AHs because their unequal treatment of you goes far beyond the gift giving. Leaving you behind for family vacations, not attending your extracurricular events, etc\u2014there is no logic under which this is fair. The fact that mom and her family seem to treat you this way, in part, because of the actions of your father (and the fact that you have a good relationship with him and his new wife, who was his partner in the affair) is also not fair.\n\nBut here\u2019s where I think you MIGHT be TAH. You acknowledge in the comments that you said and did hurtful things to your younger step-siblings that likely TRAUMATIZED them\u2014kids that were already traumatized by the death of their mother. And your reason? That their dad married your mom and they (very young kids) wanted to treat you as an older brother. I understand you were also young, but I wonder if you were you the same way toward your step-siblings on your father\u2019s side (your father and his wife having been partners in an affair that likely broke your mom\u2019s heart and ruined her marriage)? Did you ever apologize to your step-siblings? What about your step-dad? How much do you think this contributes to the relationship dynamic you have with stepdad+kids+mom? I definitely wouldn\u2019t feel the best of feelings toward anyone that traumatized my children, so that would definitely impact how stepdad felt about you. That could have (and likely did) put strain on mom\u2019s relationship with stepdad, someone she found love with again after having been betrayed in her previous marriage to your dad. And seeing you accept your father\u2019s remarriage in a way that you seem[ed] to not accept hers, when his is literally a slap in the face TO her\u2014not to say that you shouldn\u2019t accept your dad and stepmom\u2019s relationship, but the logic does seem off\u2014probably feels terrible to mom. It doesn\u2019t excuse their behavior and treatment toward you because they are the adults in the situation. But there are layers to this dysfunctional dynamic and, from your comments, it seems like you are a part of it. It also seems like there has been effort to address that dysfunction through family therapy as well\u2014and that\u2019s something to their credit. Again, there\u2019s missing context (hence the questions I asked above\u2014they are only partly rhetorical), but you seem to lack empathy toward your step-siblings and your mother and minimize the extent of damage that you caused.

Maybe it\u2019s time to look at living with your dad for a few years.  You are old enough to die in war.  In many societies 18 is not the threshold for being drafted it\u2019s younger.  You have a mind of your own and some autonomy.  Don\u2019t burn any bridges with your mom but some time away will help to heal the bad blood.  \n\nYour mom not giving you as many gifts is most likely due to your mom being the only person buying and paying for the gifts and your step father feeling no obligation to buy you anything.  Which is ok.  You have a father and you have a relationship with him.  That\u2019s good.", "They fully acknowledge they\u2019re being unfair and expect you to just go with it.

It was the mother responsibility to tell the family either all get gifts or nobody. \n\nThe adults here are using the death of the mother as an excuse.", "I didn't like the adoption because of how my mom's extended family treated me. And they used kids to hurt me even more. My grandma was the worst and others followed her. She went from loving to hateful te moment she found out about my dads infidelity.\n\nShe told me multiple times I'm ugly and stupid as my dad. When adoption happened she bragged in front of me how she has 2 grandchildren now. And her gifts were really something. I got 1 pair of socks, 2 oranges and coloring book for kids aging 4-6. She told me coloring book is appropriate for me, considering my IQ is on the level of kids age 4-6. 14 year old got a scooter from her. My mom never stops her and the others that join on her bullying.", "Except, she very clearly and obviously is.", "So as a child of divorce not un similar to OP, what you are saying is that because he has 2 parents that are sisters he shouldn\u2019t be treated equally. \n\nSo this is a what if scenario.. \n\nIf OP\u2019s mom and step dad bought the step kids tablets that cost $200 USD each but only got him a $100 USD set of headphones that\u2019s ok because his dad will get him something else worth $100 USD. That\u2019s insane, mom and dad need to get together and each chip in to get that $200 tablet and then all 4 patents names go on the gift or the 2 bio parents at least if that\u2019s what they work out with their respective spouses. \n\nThat\u2019s what my parents had to do and the big gift changed location of where I got it each year.

(that\u2019s a whole other story for another time). my gma usually just gives us $100 each for xmas. but this year she wanted to give everyone an extra $200. my stepdad has two kids. and honestly they\u2019re great people. my mom lives w them full time in new orleans while we all grew up amd lived in st louis. my gma was just gonna write a check to my mom and my mom was gonna give us cash. my gma wrote a check for only $1200. she said that that\u2019s $200 for each of us five, and another $100 for each of her step kids (we had already each gotten gifts with the original $100). my mom lit the check on fire. she said that she wasn\u2019t going to give any of us kids the money if she didn\u2019t give everyone equal. she said that if that\u2019s all she wanted to spend, that she would divide the $1200 equally among all of us 7 kids. and we all agreed. and my mom had already told all of us kids and her step kids about it. funny enough, abt 20 mins after the check thing went down, my stepdad and his kids facetimed my mom to say hi to everyone. we passed the phone around one by one. when it got to my gma, the kids were saying thank you and everything to her for it. it made her feel like shit. but my mom said that she would never treat the kids differently. that it\u2019s not the kids\u2019 fault that they married quickly. that they live in another state. my gma eventually gave in ebacuse we all gave her shit. and because it\u2019s ducking wrong. \n\nfunny enough, something similar happened where my gma stood up when they were younger. my gma and her first husband had three kids, my mom, my aunt, and my uncle. their dad was crazy abusive. my gma remarried to my (step) gpa that i grew up knowing. and they had another kid together. my step glad mom only bought my half uncle presents the first year. my gma stood up and said that wasn\u2019t fair. they actually didn\u2019t talk for years bc of it. and my mom brought that up this year. my gma made the excuse that \u201cwell those were all my kids\u201d. but my mom views our step siblings as her kids. and they\u2019ve been very much involved in our lives. idk it\u2019s just so wrong to do that to a kid. especially bc the kids are just so innocent and didn\u2019t do anything to deserve it. it\u2019s not the kids\u201d fault that those were the circumstances. so don\u2019t punish them for stuff out of their control.", "Are you incapable of using actual sentences?", "I truly feel rotten for OP here and hope OP escapes this toxic \"family\" ASAP.", "Hello, Professor Falken.", "I\u2019m not saying this is the case.

It's very probable he didn't just accept the step mom right away and that it's the favoritism of his mom that drove him away toward the step mom.\n\nAnd yes, cheating is horrible, but he was very young. If for the past 5 years, your bio mom treated you as a second class child for reasons you didn't know and your step mom always treated you equally as her bio childs, i don't think knowing she cheated would change much. Furthermore, if she was single at the time, she didn't really do anything bad. Only the dad was in a commitment.", "I'm not justifying the behavior on the maternal side, his mom could be actively trying to stop it but is outnumbered in her efforts. I'm actually more worried about parental alienation by his dad. OP admits to never accepting mom's marriage and even traumatizing the stepkids on her side. He even calls stepmom mom because he admits it hurts his mom. So I'm questioning if this is learned behavior.", "He did say mom never tried to defend him. Where did you see that he calls his step mom to hurt his bio mom? I read it as he calls her mom because she's more deserving of it then his bio mom. He knows it hurts the bio mom but that wasn't the mom goal.\n\nI did ask the OP if the awful things he said to the step sibblings was before or after the favoritism and bullying."]}
