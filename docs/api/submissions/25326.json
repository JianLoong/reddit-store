Insult to injury you were working for FREE for HER benefit while she snuck off with him. She owes YOU an apology. Also you are under no obligation to greet or make nice to him. Passively ignoring his presence and removing yourself from the space he is in is not RUDE, it is maturity tactful. You have no reason professionally or personally to interact with him.

I\u2019m in no way going to say she\u2019s being shady with this guy or anything, I\u2019m willing to chalk up the change in body language to interpretation BUT there are 2 issues that can\u2019t and should not be ignored. \n1. She/the company isn\u2019t paying you for a valuable service. \n2.

My friend told me, she basically said I am not good enough to be dated but she was keeping me around for her ego. Since then things were akward and after a month she brought it up again while we were at a bar and ultimately made me apologize to her for not telling my best friend to pipe it down instead of going outside with her (my friend was more than pissed with our situation because she saw I was being used and she defended me, no romantic strings, she is genuinely my best friend) and up until that point I was still in love with her but after the forced apology, I was done. I came back after a lot of bad things but she was the one who fucked up my party and made me apologize for it. That was the final straw.

Ask her if she didn't feel so guilty or wasn't doing anything wrong she wouldn't have ran after you. Tell her to go be with him and that's where she can take that apology.", "I hope you update us on this. But they are gaslighting the shit out of you. You deserve better.", "NTA. Maybe  TA for the free labour  but this is very much a trust but verify thing I am thinking if it were me I would be gone  let us know if there are follow ups", "NTA. I think your reaction and simultaneous assertion of your boundary here is INCREDIBLY reasonable considering the context (Her guy friend wanting you to break up and their previous history) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think that her dramatic reaction here also says something about her not really respecting your will and also her not being transparent with the fact that she was going to leave to meet him is a clear red flag in this situation.", "NTA at all.", "For sure NTA. She should respect you more.  Not the other way around", "NTA, don\u2019t apologize to either and in fact you should leave her. Move on to bigger and better things, buddy.", "So, a newly single chef, eh? How YOU doing?", "NTA. It sounds very suspicious around this ex and you basically got dumped to do the work during the whole event for her to socialise. It appears she's manipilating you whether she's conscious of it or not.\n\nYou may want to sit down and write a list of relationship pros and cons and really think about whether there are other red flag or relationship problems. \n\nI'd do this without mentioning it to your partner as I have been in a very similar situation myself and my partner would always find a way to turn any red flags or problems into either no issue, my fault or me over thinking, paranoid etc. It got to the point with my ex she literally by definition gaslit me. I came out thinking I was losing my mind a bit and not thinking clearly.\n\nYou may even want to show a friend that you trust the list as they can be more objective and not blinded like you may be.", "You need to leave her for good. You won\u2019t have peace of mind as long as you have a relationship with her. Be with someone who wants to be with you and appreciates you. Thats it. Simple simple.", "Buddy it's cooked and you know it. And you've known it long before this happened.", "NTA.  No apologies for him!", "My vote is ESH because I don't think she should have gone off with him without giving you a heads up and she's now handling it poorly, but storming off and leaving her wasn't a mature way to handle it on your part. You both sound like you're about 18 rather than 38.", "You left a woman you *claim* to care for without a chaperone, sullied her reputation, insulted a valued companion and to add salt to the wound you would have her cross the busy street alone, unaided? How do call yourself a gentleman, sir?  Dishonorable actions are not becoming of one who would boast that claim.", "If you do break up with her, send the company your hours worked and if they say anything tell them your girlfriend said you would get paid.", "NTA.  As many pointed, leave this relationship", "NTA.  She had a date with someone else and couldn\u2019t be bothered with you.", "NTA. Also !updateme", "NTA, obviously. I didn't know that trade shows that last 2 weeks were a thing!", "NTA and I have to ask\u2026 pampered chef?", "NTA. Why are you bothering?", "Do not apologize to this shady person\nShe's prioritizing him over you even when you're doing her a favor. Wake up. You're being an AH to yourself", "NTA. She knows she done goofed and is gaslighting you, making it like u were the one who is in the wrong. Don't fall for that sort of manipulation. Also idt is unreasonable for u to demand she cut contacts w the guy given their relationship and what he said. You need to set that boundary if not she's just disrespecting your relationship", "Why didn\u2019t he come to the stall rather than messaging her and meeting her elsewhere.  \n\nNTA", "NTA. id probably of kept walking and just left. but if you do that your relationship might be over. probably better that way if shes messing with other guys that you dont mess with. life is too short to play games like that", "The only apology should be coming from her.  NTA.", "Nta. dont apologize", "And I suspect that she\u2019s acting mad and that OP did wrong to try to cover up the fact that she knows she was doing wrong.", "Correction:  \u2026. apologize to the guy who **is still trying** to break you up.\n\nFTFY.", "You are a good guy. NTA. She left you by yourself to meet up with a \"friend\" and didn't think anything of it.  That's just rude. You were rightfully upset and left. You didn't leave her there to fend for herself.  \nI hope you have more vacation time. Take it for yourself.", "Please check my comments. You should see my others on my profile. It'll explain the potential seriousness of what may be going on in your relationship from the looks of things and a suggestion of something to do.\n\nI'd also check online resources that might offer other ideas.\n\nI think the longer you're with someone the more susceptible you are to it too sometimes.", "This 100%. I've been this guy. I didn't trust my gut and would be manipulated into thinking I was paranoid and whenever she'd do something wrong in general she'd find a way to make me be the one apologising or groveling.\n\nI hope OP gets away from this person.\n\nEven that excuse about crossing a road by herself. It's ridiculous but when you're in it it's very hard to fully understand how you're being manipulated and your instincts are correct.\n\nOP needs to write a list with every red flag, bad aspect, shady thing about the relationship and her. Then take a step back. He can't tell her he's doing this though as she will find ways to twist it all. \n\nHe could even show a trusted friend the list as they can be more objective and see through the b.s.\n\nMy life would've been completely different and much better had I not continued down the road I did with my ex. She truly gaslit me. Legitimately. Not just as a phrase people say. It ruined my mental health eventually.\n\nHer lifelong best friend for a good 20-25yrs or so realised it had to stop before I did. I never spoke negatively to her best friend about our relationship but one day she came to me, told me some stuff that'd happened or was said and that she decided she could no longer be friends with her over what she did to me.\n\nI got a text and eventually an email a couple of years later saying her therapist made her realise what she'd done. She was trying to reel me back in from the looks of it. She said she'd never contact again if I didn't respond. So I didn't. I felt like I got some power back in that moment. I don't mean in a game kind of way. I'm straightforward in relationships and don't do any mindgame b.s. However she'd took so much from me mentally and emotionally. \n\nI think some parts in her email even ended up being a lie too in the end. She hadn't fully changed.\n\nI would hate to see OP end up where I did mentally and emotionally.", "I would NEVER cross the street by myself. I have to hold someone's hand every time, even if it's a stranger", "True, that's pretty likely.", "Buddy\u2026 no, it\u2019s takes two to cheat/flirt, if he\u2019s the one pushing this then the 38 year old women should know better then to talk to her ex in a way her bf would like, he\u2019s clearly not into the bf so why talk to the enemy of your lover?", "I snorted at the idea of you reaching out for some stranger's hand to cross the road.", "Lol well you can never be too cautious!", "God I've been through this. It can be so awful and have a serious impact on a person.\n\nI became mentally unwell from it.", "Gaslighting can often substitute for the Denial. Like, \"you're seeing things\" instead of \"X didn't happen\".", "I've been through this. Being truly gaslit for an extended period of time is just awful. I can't even convey how much it damaged me.\n\nIt ruined my mental health and my life is completely different because of it even years on I haven't got myself back yet.\n\nIt's why it upsets me sometimes when people throw the phrase around willy nilly. It can be really serious and completely destroy a person from within.\n\nYou never think you'd be the one to fall for it either. It can happen to most of us if conditions are just right.", "NTA - take her silent treatment as an opportunity to lay it all out on the table.", "Nut up, dude. They're the assholes. Both of them left you to do all that work while they sat around and, what? Poured over Excel, making business plans? LOL. \n\nHer reaction should tell you everything. I'm pretty sure you can do better. Sure as shit can't do worse with those albatross' around your neck.\n\nNTA-", "YTA if you apologize to either one of them.. And you really need to sit back and look at this relationship.", "No, she is the a$$hole! She should never have asked you to take time off from your work to work for free. The fact that you did is all to your credit. Her \"catching up\" with him on your dime was over the top. She could have caught up with him after you were both done. If he wanted to catch up with her, he could have made time for it then. She owes you an apology for taking you for granted.", "You just triggered the fight or flight reaction.", "She took advantage of you helping her for free at her work event and then snuck off to meet her old(?) fling. She disrespected you (so did he) and she owes you a huge sincere apology but frankly her behaviors was shady at best so you may want to rethink the whole idea of being in a relationship with her.", "That doesn\u2019t make her innocent. Even if her ex fling basically ambushed her does mean she had to sit with him and have an intimate conversation. She should have immediately returned to her stall and OP. She is just as shit shady as her her ex", "Time to get a new girlfriend. She\u2019s not over him and enjoys playing with fire at your expense.", "NTA for this at all, you have nothing to apologize for. You guys should have a serious conversation about boundaries and she owes you an apology for the skeezy behavior. YTA for grammar tho sheesh", "NTA. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if she was having an affair. I know it's hard to hear, but this sounds very much like cheating behavior.\n\nEven if not, you were working at HER STALL, FOR FREE. It's your decision when to leave and let her run her own stand.\n\nOP, you do not need to apologize for ANYTHING. Your girlfriend sounds like she's manipulating and gaslighting you into thinking you're the bad guy. You aren't.", "Nope she is definitely keeping this guy around as backup.  \n\nHopefully you don\u2019t live with her and can just ghost her.  She is a manipulative person who is also possibly cheating. Sorry \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79\n\nNTA \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf", "Ffs who fucking cares my guy you\u2019re acting like a year old pre pubescent child\u2026 you don\u2019t need validation from people who spend all day on a webpage giving advice like they\u2019re therapists. Grow a pair of balls you\u2019re 38 years old my guy\u2026 the hell is wrong with you people\u2026", "Definitely not the AH she knows she was doing something wrong.! That\u2019s so shady! Sorry you went through that but she sounds like she\u2019s gaslighting you.  Let us know what happens next lol", "NTA...BUT as several people have pointed out, you don't need her. In a healthy relationship, a partner does not keep a friend that doesn't like their partner. Because a real friend wants your girlfriend to be happy. He doesn't because he wants her. She needs to end that friendship or you end the relationship.", "NTA. If she values her fling that much they can stay together. Do not apologize for her mess. Use the rest of your free time to either rest and do something fun or go back to work. Honestly wth?", "NTA. She\u2019s 38 years old. She knows better.", "NTA. Cut her loose. She\u2019s not worth your time", "NTA she was being completely disrespectful to you. She has you working for free to help her, lies to you and goes to flirt with a guy that hates you and wants to out of the picture. Don't apologize to either of them. She's leading you on, it's time to see the flashing red flags and take your leave", "You have nothing to apologise for!!! This woman is playing you for an idiot. Time to move on from her devious self. NTA", "I\u2019ve been crossing busy streets since I was kid, pretty sure the GF survived. I\u2019m sorry you have to be here asking about something so ridiculous.\n\nI would say gf needs to grow up but the whole thing with this other dude seems suss af to me.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She is though.", "Why is she sneaking off to see a former lover that shit talks you and tells her to break up with you? She should be telling him to fuck off and leave her relationship alone. At the least she\u2019s having an emotional affair. At worst\u2026.you know.", "This is absolutely why she is gaslighting and attempting to shift blame", "For some reason it immediately brought Milne\u2019s poem Disobedience to mind.  \"Mother,\" he said, said he;  \"You must never go down to the end of the town, if you don't go down with me.\"", "It's what 98% of politicians use, and it works for about 30% of them."]}
