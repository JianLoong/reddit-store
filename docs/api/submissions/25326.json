That was a massive breach of trust and boundries in my opinion. You work your ass of for her work voluntarily on top for her to leave you in the middle of it to catch up with her old fling?

You already expressed your discomfort about that friend and she chooses to ignore that fact altogether.

I would like to throw a slightly different perspective in here than most of the comments. If gf had told you where she was going/what she was doing (or asked if it was OK!) then you would not have had the same issue with the situation (if I've read correctly). If you had told her that you were leaving, then she wouldn't have any leg to stand on to complain about. As it was though, it ended up a bit tit-for-tat-y: she left without telling you, so you left without telling her (and rather performatively as you knew she'd seen you). Obviously this is outside of the whole working for free/dodgy ex business, but it might be where the friction is coming from on her end. Just imagining that if I was her, and hadn't realised I had done anything improper, then you 'storming off' could have come as a shock.

The business needs to hire someone. Both for insurance reasons, and because people working for free distorts their idea of how much work is realistic. Which will then lead to unrealistic expectations of their employees. Probably the next person in your girlfriend's shoes will get reprimanded or fired for not doing enough at the booth, because the higher-ups won't realize your girlfriend had free help."]}
