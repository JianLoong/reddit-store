Does she uses you for other things in the relationship too?  I feel like these type of people uses people to get what they want then turn victim when they get caught", "NTA \n\nRelationship done she is untrustworthy and is now shifting blame as she was caught in an awkward position. She wouldn't have acted like that if it was completely innocent. \n\nYou were helping her and her company out, and she shit all over you.\n\nRed flags are flying around everywhere.", "I had an ex fiancee just like your gf except I didn't know that the friend was someone she had an off and on fling with a few times. He never liked me and for sure made every possibility to cut me from her. She had a secret meeting with him that she told me was something she was doing with another person. She ended up cheating. She wouldn't stop being \"friends\" with him \n\nTake my advice, if she refuses to stop being friends with a guy like this, take it as a victory and high tail it out of there. You will save yourself a ton of grief and time.\n\nTo me, you are not the AH. I would have done the same thing. She clearly doesn't see you higher on the chart than him. Good way for her to \"catch up\" with him since he can give her a ride home. And LMFAO at apologing to both of them especially a guy who has stated he doesn't like you and tried to break you two up", "Seems like an NTA to me - would clear up the situation but it's really fishy she would just leave you to take care of this while she's \"catching\" up. I would not have an issue catching up with a friend in front of my partner, if I had nothing to hide.", "Op leave her clearly she doesn't respect you or your time", "NTA. It sounds like SHE abandoned YOU at her own work event\u2026.for not a work contact. You weren\u2019t obligated to go find her and you could have just seen her talking to someone and didn\u2019t want to interrupt. Never mind that it was this guy in particular. She\u2019s talking to someone at her work trade show and had transportation home. Her reaction says a lot too. She wasn\u2019t expecting you to have questions? And now asking you to apologize to both her and a guy she knows actively dislikes you? Nah. She owes you an explanation and probably an apology.", "NTA - leave her and don\u2019t look back", "NTA and did I read this right - she told you she had a work call but was actually talking to her ex fling? So she lied on top of all that?", "Do not apologize to her or him ! Break up with her ! You deserve better", "NTA ... DO NOT EVEN THINK OF APOLOGISING! Also anyone with me on the thing that she night be cheating.", "NTA, this the first time you've shown her that you have a spine?", "NTA. And if she's not willing to apologize and see your point of view she should become your ex-GF.", "NTA.  One word of advice for you, bro.  RUN!  It's obvious that she's still hung up on this guy.  Otherwise she never would have left to meet with him in the first place.  Then she twisted it around to make you the AH.  She's manipulating you at best, cheating on you at worst.  Either way I'd be done with her.", "NTA. Value yourself and your time more than you do.", "NTA. Girfriend is working both sides. no good. Ditch her it will only get worse", "OP, you don't HAVE to apologize to anybody. If anything, your gf should apologize to YOU. NTA", "I think you know what to do here. I\u2019m sorry man.", "No way are you TAH.  How disrespectful for her to leave you holding the bag at her event whilst she snuck away without giving you the courtesy of letting you know where she was going.  Cognitive dissonance to demand an apology from you\u2026 I would not have only crossed the street\u2026 I would have kept on going.", "NTA but get tested for STDs", "she's trying to see how much shit you'll put up with", "NTA. She has a problem with boundaries.", "Man have some self respect,might as well let him fuck your girl after you apologize to him", "She used you to cover her job to talk to him. The fact that she got shocked when you saw them and chased after you tells you she knows she was in the wrong and after all that instead of apologising she decides to gaslight you. I\u2019m sorry OP but this one belongs to the streets. NTA I hope your next partner is better.", "NTA.  No need to apologize to your ex.", "Absolutely not the AH,   she has some balls saying its your fault, id be furious, absolutely livid!!!!!    You are right, just tell me where you are going since im working for free to help you!!!!   Absolutely disrespectful", "Personally I wouldn't apologize to her. I understand that in order to make a relationship work sometimes you play dumb, or mute or deaf and that sometimes you let slide things that frustrate you\n\nBut becoming a doormat should never be in the cards (aka she went to talk to a former \"friend with benefits\", who is obviously still into her by his not at all subtle jealousy, while on the job and let  you look like an ass putting in effort that should've been hers to put in)", "So, OP, your GF is either cheating or overstepping boundaries. To deflect from that, rather than apologizing and explaining what she was doing, she's twisted the situation to make you the one at fault... am I getting that correctly? On top of that, you were working for her for free while she blatantly overstepped boundaries with another man.\n\nIs she usually this manipulative? I would be done with this girl. I wouldn't be able to trust anything she says.", "This, she knew, she is using D.A.R.V.O big time right now.", "In this situation, I\u2019d leave her, period. Letting you work her work event, for free, while she has a hidden hangout with her (ex?) fling? Wow. That\u2019s fucking rude. Of her, not you.", "NTA - she is way out of line. \n\nI'd tell her to get a hold of you when she's ready to behave like the grown ass woman you thought you were dating.", "Yup!", "Hire car services are a thing", "It's the future, if you break up with somebody they can go get an Uber", "OP is the side piece provider, other guy gets free sex for giving a little attention.", "Lol, hahaha. A young, healthy adult is unable to cross the road by herself. Lol", "Hey OP, right now you look like a doormat. Drop that girl and get one that only wants to spend time with you.", "[removed]", "Sounds like you are a sucker but if you like/love someone logic seems to always go out the window. \n\nThe fact she\u2019s wants you to apologise to both of them is mad. This guy whether you see it or not is a love interest and someone that can defo put a dent in your relationship, you need to speak to her and think about what you really want from this.", "Personally, I believe helping her out as you did was a very generous thing to do. You\u2019re a good guy, OP.", "[removed]", "NTA\n\nShe's doing something wrong and she knows it.  That's why she didn't tell you.  \n\nWhen you see your significant other across the room, you'd expect the realization of seeing them, a wave, \"hey come on over\" or at least \"hi\".  \n\nNot deer in headlights and running after them _knowing_ something is wrong.  \n\nShe's busted big time.", "NTA\n\nI'd leave the event completely and return to my own paid work and let her clean up after herself. But that's just me.", "NTA. She was using you. Dump her.", "YTA. You outdo the other guy by not being as big of a d-bag as he is, not trying to put d-bag him. He doesn't like you? Treat him with nothing but kindness. As for being pissy about working for free, why did you agree to it? You're pretty whiny for someone who claims to be a grown up.", "NTAH. She\u2019s into the other guy and uses you for her own benefit. Also, she doesn\u2019t respect you or your boundaries if she keeps entertaining an ex against your wishes. I know it\u2019s hard at 38 to leave someone, but you should.", "Nta. Despite having an agreement that she give you heads up when meeting with her disrespectful friend She snuck behind your back to meet with this \"friend\" with whom has given ultimatum demanding your relationship end. You two also already have agreement in place that you are \"kept out\" of her dealings with him due to his disrespect and your mutual dislike. Insult to injury you were working for FREE for HER benefit while she snuck off with him. She owes YOU an apology. Also you are under no obligation to greet or make nice to him. Passively ignoring his presence and removing yourself from the space he is in is not RUDE, it is maturity tactful. You have no reason professionally or personally to interact with him. Finally she's a grown ass healthy woman she doesn't require your assistance to cross the road. Looking both ways is advice we tell preschoolers and young children, if she needs a remedial lesson it is not your job to provide it.\nEta...demanding you apologize to both her and the dude she is probably cheating with (at the very least emotionally cheating) is manipulative, controlling and borderline gaslighting behaviour. She's switching the script to put you in the baddest to avoid her own culpability and misbehavior.", "I CANNOT BELIEVE THE DISRESPECT. NTA", "Nta", "NTA\n\nI thought you were too nice of a guy to start with. Very liberal, understanding, and trusting of your girlfriend.\n\nIt was slightly ruined when you simply turned around instead of listening to your girlfriend.\n\nHowever, when her response is to blame you for not saying hello and leaving her to cross the street herself rather than question why you turned around and communicating I think shes obviously cheating on you and your spidey senses were right. Shes using you as a doormat. Move on.", "I\u2019m a bit sensitive and sympathetic about this subject, as far as being friends with ex\u2019s. I\u2019m still on speaking terms with all of my ex\u2019s. That said, she did not communicate with you, which I think is the biggest issue. If I\u2019m going to spend time with an ex, I\u2019ll have no issues what-so-ever telling my boyfriend about it. If he has an issue with that, that\u2019s on him, and is a deal breaker for me. \n\nAs everyone else has said, the larger issue is that you\u2019re working for free, I understand being a nice guy and wanting to help your partner, but you\u2019re performing a skill on behalf of a company and you should absolutely be getting paid for it. I\u2019m in no way going to say she\u2019s being shady with this guy or anything, I\u2019m willing to chalk up the change in body language to interpretation BUT there are 2 issues that can\u2019t and should not be ignored. \n1. She/the company isn\u2019t paying you for a valuable service. \n2. She thought it necessary to misrepresent what she was leaving to do, even if them meeting was about business, the issue is she didn\u2019t communicate about who she was meeting with, and that\u2019s not okay.", "NTA. Leave her altogether, she's not going to respect you and isn't treating the relationship with any respect. She's likely cheating with the loser, but doesn't want to date him because he's lacking elsewhere, so she's keeping you around for what he lacks. Let her chose him and sleep in the bed she made.", "Nah man that sounds like she is still in to him and I guarantee you she will be like \"no way we are just friends now\" but when he told her to break up with you, she should have told him to go fuck himself BUT she didn't and that says it all", "NTA... But please nip the gaslighting attempts on the bud and don't be a doormat,  she's lying to you and there's definitely something going on between them, also she literally used you for free labour and can't even show one ounce of respect,  is that normal in your relationship?", "Not the AH.  You are being gaslit.  This relationship is probably close to over.", "NTA. She showed her true colors and her acting like her crossing the street alone is an argument with any merit should be grounds for dumping a 38 year old woman. She is either very stupid and you shouldn\u2019t respect her intelligence or judgement or she\u2019s being intentionally manipulative and throwing everything against the wall because she knows she\u2019s wrong. Which means she doesn\u2019t respect you.", "NTA, shorty knows she\u2019s wrong and is trying to shift the blame on you. Like seriously \u201cyou made her cross a busy road by herself\u201d that was a serious point she made in this whole thing? If she had a fling with him once she\u2019ll do it again. It sounds like she doesn\u2019t respect your feelings or time, so either leaver her, play the mind games or ride it out until she leaves or sees where she is wrong.", "NTA - your GF is really disrespectful.  She's crossed emotional boundaries with this guy and is or already has crossed physical boundaries with him.  In other words, if she isn't already cheating, she going to soon.  \n\nIt sucks when we give a relationship our time, energy, love and care - and the other person basically takes and takes and disrespects and doesn't care about us or our feelings.  It's okay to cut your losses and realize that you deserve to get back what you give.    \n\n\nYou sound like a caring thoughtful guy.  You deserve a relationship that gives back the same level of kindness.  Don't settle for less.  You may have real feelings for her so this probably sucks, but you deserve someone who has real feelings back.  Good luck.", "Oh, hell no. Get away from that user!", "NTA and how she reacted when you saw them is super sus. A person not up to something would be confident and calm, not give you the \ud83d\ude33 face and then overcompensate by gaslighting you into feeling bad. That\u2019s\u2026really suspicious. Good on you for walking away.\n\nAnd if she needed a ride, she obviously had someone to take her. Just saying.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to apologize anyone.", "NTA and F them both. You're being gaslit by them. They owe you an apology.", "NTA, you were working her event unpaid while she was off having a \u201csecret meeting\u201d with her ex.

This whole situation is messed up.", "Yep, lies will continue  NTA", "Nta I how she sees this post and comes to her senses.  She should have never left you to work at her work event to me a said man. She has clearly overstepped her bounds by meeting with someone who didn't like your guys relationship.  That is a red flag she clearly missed. Now she is trying to force the blame on you for what making her cross a street at night? Gtfo", "If she's not cheating I'll eat my shoe.", "Dating the modern woman", "NTAH.\n\n\nShe was -- AT BEST -- being an inconsiderate, rude asshole toward you.\n\n\nShe owes you a sincere apology and a discussion about reasonable boundaries.", "No. You did the grown up thing and left. You didnt yell, cause drama or anything. She should've been happy. She has something going on with him or she wouldn't have acted like the got caught with her hand in the cookie jar. Dude. I would have left the event and left her. Red flags.", "NTA. End things now, OP. When she forces you to apologize for an AH move she pulled off, it's over.\nI was in a relationship without benefits (the opposite of friends with benefits, you have all the troubles of a relationship but no sex) for 5 years. At one point she and my best female friend had a clash at a party of mine, I tried to comfort her by talking a walk outside (during my own party) and after they had a kitchen talk in private. My friend told me, she basically said I am not good enough to be dated but she was keeping me around for her ego. Since then things were akward and after a month she brought it up again while we were at a bar and ultimately made me apologize to her for not telling my best friend to pipe it down instead of going outside with her (my friend was more than pissed with our situation because she saw I was being used and she defended me, no romantic strings, she is genuinely my best friend) and up until that point I was still in love with her but after the forced apology, I was done. I came back after a lot of bad things but she was the one who fucked up my party and made me apologize for it. That was the final straw. So, take it from experience, don't apologize, let her fling win, she is not worth the drama because her behaviour shows nothing but disrespect for you.", "NTA you\u2019re working for free? Dude, no!", "NTA\n\nBut, if you continue to keep this woman in your life, then I will be changing that determination.", "NTA\n\nMy friend, must we spell it out for you?", "Get out now.

If she looked like she got caught doing something she shouldn't have ben, then she knew better, and chose to do it anyways.
