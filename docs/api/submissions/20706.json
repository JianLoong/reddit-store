But now that those exams are done, I do think it's time to prioritize your sister's feelings. \n\nHonestly, I think your best move is to behave as if you terribly regret your decision, even if you don't. She is going through the unimaginable. Just set aside your pride and defensiveness do what you can for her now. What's done is done, and it's the only thing that's really in your power to do to make your sister feel loved by you during the worst moment of her life. Apologize and apologize hard. It costs you nothing and will go far in maintaining the health of your relationships with your sister and with the rest of your family.   \n\n\nNAH.

Yep, no way, I\u2019m showing up to that exam unless I\u2019m physically incapable of doing so. Not to mention, by then you can\u2019t really reschedule. You\u2019d just lose the expensive registration fee and possibly one of your MCAT attempts - the latter is not inconsequential.

People sacrifice a lot of time and even spend money on prep courses/materials.\n\nYou did your best to support your sister under the circumstances and she had other support as well. Losing a baby is devastating, which I can attest to from personal experience. But the MCAT can have a massive effect on your future (it sure did for me - allowing me to be accepted to medical school), and re-studying for it/sacrificing an attempt is definitely a big deal, so you are absolutely not an AH for still going through with it.

They're more giving the sister grace because it literally happened a few days ago and she's presumably still reeling from grief, hormonal, and not in the state of mind to be reasonable about arguments. I think OPs mom is very wise to not take sides, literally the worst thing anyone could do is turn this into more of an argument when the most healing thing for Mia and OP's relationship is just space from each other for now. \n\nIf this conflict was still going on months later I'd be of the same mindset as you.", "Keep in mind if they didnt attend this one, it would count as a fail. Meaning they'd only have 2 attempts left for this year, or 3 within a 2 year period.", "$330 is a lot of money for most people. Also, as someone else pointed out, it seems unlikely that OP was the sister's only emotional support. \n\nApplying to med school is an exhausting and stressful process (source: I met my wife while she was pre-med); taking the MCAT isn't remotely like taking a course final. Taking the test might not have been the best decision, but I'm not prepared to call OP TA.", "Do you even know what the MCAT is? You can't reschedule it within 10 days of your exam date. What the sister went through is terrible for sure, and if OP was blowing her off to go party with friends then yes that's a completely AH move. But this is damn important and OP was there for the sister other times, even went back to the hospital straight after finishing a 7 hour long exam. OP is in no way the asshole here, what more do you want her to do?", "$330 is a shit ton of money to most people.", "you can\u2019t reschedule or cancel and MCAT test 10 days before the test. If you do not show up it counts  as a failure and as 1 of your lifetime try\u2019s.\n\nThe MCAT exam can be taken up to three times. Two consecutive-year period: The MCAT exam can be taken up to four times.\n\nPlus meds schools see how many times a failure happens which is what not showing up would be considered.

You can't reschedule within 8 days of the test.", "Op left the hospital as they took her sister in to do a C-section for the stillborn. She knew all of that and left. So she missed being there for her sister while she held her baby and said goodbye. She knew that\u2019s what she was walking away from when she left. The post is confusing but that\u2019s what happened.", "Ok from what I am reading is you can\u2019t reschedule or cancel and MCAT test 10 days before the test.

I've seen the prep work.  My question had to do with what it would take to retake the exam (not something I ever considered as a mere observer to the process).", "> what more do you want her to do?\n\nIf it's practical (and it sounds like it is), reschedule the test and be there for sis.", "I know what the MCAT.  I made no mention of him rescheduling.", "You didn't even read my comment. You can't reschedule the MCAT within 10 (or maybe 8 as someone else pointed out) days of your exam date.\n\nAnd OP's been there for her sister the rest of the time. It's sad that the timings conflicted but there's nothing else OP could do. It's also not as if OP's the only for of support sister has.", "I was not commenting whether she was an asshole or not. I was answering somebody\u2019s question about how often the test was administered and also added that they would lose their registration fee", "I wasn't replying to you, sorry. There's another commenter that keeps saying to just reschedule and all that, I was pointing it out to them.", "> You didn't even read my comment. You can't reschedule the MCAT within 10 (or maybe 8 as someone else pointed out) days of your exam date.\n\nThe other comments indicated that you simply lose your registration fee in this instance.  It's not that you can NEVER take the test again.... Or are you saying that once you're within 8 days if you don't show for any reason you can kiss med school goodbye?  Seems kinda crazy if so, thus I'm inclined to think that you simply need to reschedule (and pay the fee again, yes).\n\n> And OP's been there for her sister the rest of the time. It's sad that the timings conflicted but there's nothing else OP could do. \n\nEat the $330, and taking the test next month isn't an option?\n\nedit:  Don't get me wrong, if you are NEVER allowed to reschedule the MCAT again, or it's only given like once a year?  Hey, that's a different scenario.  But so far it just sounds to me like it costs $330 and a few weeks.", "Yes, I was the one who asked how often the test is administered.  And I'm also the one who (after looking up the fee) doesn't see the big deal about the fee given the situation.  Not to say that I like to just flush $300, but to say that my tolerance for flushing funds would be significantly altered by the scenario described by OP.", "No problem"]}
