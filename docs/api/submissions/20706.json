But now that those exams are done, I do think it's time to prioritize your sister's feelings. \n\nHonestly, I think your best move is to behave as if you terribly regret your decision, even if you don't. She is going through the unimaginable. Just set aside your pride and defensiveness do what you can for her now. What's done is done, and it's the only thing that's really in your power to do to make your sister feel loved by you during the worst moment of her life. Apologize and apologize hard. It costs you nothing and will go far in maintaining the health of your relationships with your sister and with the rest of your family.   \n\n\nNAH.

Yep, no way, I\u2019m showing up to that exam unless I\u2019m physically incapable of doing so. Not to mention, by then you can\u2019t really reschedule. You\u2019d just lose the expensive registration fee and possibly one of your MCAT attempts - the latter is not inconsequential.

People sacrifice a lot of time and even spend money on prep courses/materials.\n\nYou did your best to support your sister under the circumstances and she had other support as well. Losing a baby is devastating, which I can attest to from personal experience. But the MCAT can have a massive effect on your future (it sure did for me - allowing me to be accepted to medical school), and re-studying for it/sacrificing an attempt is definitely a big deal, so you are absolutely not an AH for still going through with it.

Did she get a good night sleep or was she up worrying? Did she play her pump up exam song or was she texting her family right before the exam? I don\u2019t think she is an AH to her sister but to herself. Maybe she has the mental fortitude to have done her best. Maybe stress doesn\u2019t effect her test taking skills like most people .

To be fair, no one is supporting OP's sister's behaviour, her mom is on her side, and almost no one is calling OP an AH in the comments. They're more giving the sister grace because it literally happened a few days ago and she's presumably still reeling from grief, hormonal, and not in the state of mind to be reasonable about arguments. I think OPs mom is very wise to not take sides, literally the worst thing anyone could do is turn this into more of an argument when the most healing thing for Mia and OP's relationship is just space from each other for now. \n\nIf this conflict was still going on months later I'd be of the same mindset as you.", "Keep in mind if they didnt attend this one, it would count as a fail.

I think that without attempting to show your support (even from a distance, by dropping off her groceries or cleaning the house, something task oriented and routine that she needs and makes her life easier not to do; since it\u2019s routine you can prove over time through consistency that you do care) you are sending the message that you really aren\u2019t there for her. She\u2019s going through an unimaginable loss and grief is weird, sometimes it\u2019s helpful to have something external and safe to lash out at emotionally. I think that\u2019s you in this case. I have had a close friend lose a sibling and then lash out at me for something trivial, and my advice is to allow it. Let them. Show them you are safe and you love them and without saying it, show them you understand by just loving them back and forgiving their anger and words this time. Don\u2019t make her apologize, because you get it. She needs to feel a powerful emotion to distract herself/to channel her inner pain and anger is great for that.

It's more like \"Oh, you can start the 3 month process to prep for the test all over again!\"", "Many take it within a certain time frame because it allows you to take it during the year before you enter medical school and during your summer off before your senior year of undergrad.

If you cancel more than 8 days before the test there is a substantial fee to do so and you have no idea how long it may be before you can get another attempt and if you\u2019ll get to take it at your chosen testing center.
