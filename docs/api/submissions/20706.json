She is going through the unimaginable. Just set aside your pride and defensiveness do what you can for her now. What's done is done, and it's the only thing that's really in your power to do to make your sister feel loved by you during the worst moment of her life. Apologize and apologize hard.

Yep, no way, I\u2019m showing up to that exam unless I\u2019m physically incapable of doing so. Not to mention, by then you can\u2019t really reschedule. You\u2019d just lose the expensive registration fee and possibly one of your MCAT attempts - the latter is not inconsequential.

People sacrifice a lot of time and even spend money on prep courses/materials.\n\nYou did your best to support your sister under the circumstances and she had other support as well. Losing a baby is devastating, which I can attest to from personal experience. But the MCAT can have a massive effect on your future (it sure did for me - allowing me to be accepted to medical school), and re-studying for it/sacrificing an attempt is definitely a big deal, so you are absolutely not an AH for still going through with it.

Did she get a good night sleep or was she up worrying? Did she play her pump up exam song or was she texting her family right before the exam?

Please normalise explaining acronyms.", "> saying I could've just done it another day and I thought some test was more important than her and her baby's life, and that I deserve to fail.\n\nYou never said the MCAT was more important than her and her baby\u2019s life, it\u2019s not like you could have saved her baby by not going to the MCAT.

I\u2019m sad for you both. \n\nLook, I don\u2019t think you should default to giving her space right now unless she makes it very clear she wants that. I think that without attempting to show your support (even from a distance, by dropping off her groceries or cleaning the house, something task oriented and routine that she needs and makes her life easier not to do; since it\u2019s routine you can prove over time through consistency that you do care) you are sending the message that you really aren\u2019t there for her. She\u2019s going through an unimaginable loss and grief is weird, sometimes it\u2019s helpful to have something external and safe to lash out at emotionally. I think that\u2019s you in this case. I have had a close friend lose a sibling and then lash out at me for something trivial, and my advice is to allow it. Let them. Show them you are safe and you love them and without saying it, show them you understand by just loving them back and forgiving their anger and words this time. Don\u2019t make her apologize, because you get it. She needs to feel a powerful emotion to distract herself/to channel her inner pain and anger is great for that. When it\u2019s someone who loves you enough to take it, in this one very specific instance (and not normally), then that\u2019s why it\u2019s directed at you. \n\nBut also know that you aren\u2019t a bad sister. The circumstances were brutal. You did what you had to do and you returned to her side. I imagine no part of this was easy for you. You did your best, and I\u2019m proud of you for even completing that test. I think you need to just throw love at this situation and in time she will come around. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your sister, and I\u2019m sorry that you the timing of circumstances worked out this way for you.

She feels betrayed and her emotions are not only heightened because of hormones but also because of grief. Like\u2026.not to make this sound awful, but the easiest way to put it is cats will have their babies as close to the person they feel safest and most loved by.

Since she tooke the gamble and lost, now she for just wants a scapegoat to blame the whole situation on and you are an easy target. Stop allowing this to happen.

I get that in her grief it may have felt like she wanted absolutely everyone there, because sometimes it feels like if you can just fill the room, you won\u2019t notice the person who is missing. However, I am very surprised that the hospital was allowing that many people in the room. I wonder how long they let them all stay.

If you postponed it, you might not be ready for it and you might built up a study debt, you might be working be the time it comes around again I don't know, or you might not be awarded it etc etc but you can't recreate these carefully balanced life altering events such as a medical exam or study year/course. Your life, and your livelihood, depends on it. So no, it's not the same as a loss of a child but also no, it's not comparible. It's just an extremely unfortunate timing between the two. She will come round if you stay in one place and don't let it rock you.

Rescheduling my exam by even 2 months would have meant that I needed to continue that same schedule for an additional two months (or even more grueling, since I'd have been back in school and concurrently studying for my main courses as well) as most of the MCAT is fact regurgitation that you only need to retain for the purposes of the test, and only a small amount of it tests actual knowledge applicable to medicine.", "I agree.

If I don't feel prepared, I figure I'm still going to get a better score than I deserve.  Second, if I have a condensed version of what I'll be testing on, I'll put it into my temporary memory by reading it over quickly before the exam.

If I don't have that, then I spent time the night before reviewing, and if I didn't do that, I figure I'll still get a better grade than I deserve.\n\n\n\nI'm not bragging, just pointing out that there is another side... dummies that test well.", "There's a reason we have the highest sucide rates outside of military.

I had perfect scores (high 30s) for the English, Writing, and Reading portions of the ACT, but because of a learning disability my Mathematics and Science scores were in the teens. That tanked my composite score. I still got into the university I wanted so it wasn't the *hugest* deal, but it still does leave me salty that people would look at my score and think me \"stupid\" simply because all of my intelligence went into language rather than STEM.", "Also a 13 on the ACT is obscenely low.\n\nYou've clearly missed out on or failed to retain a lot of \"book learning\" if you score that low on the ACT", "You didn't game those tests.

Test anxiety doesn't go away when you enter college, and there are lots of exams in college.  The test illustrated that your daughter is not as prepared as someone who has been successfully treated for this condition. Perhaps the stupider student without anxiety is better prepared.

I did good on standardized tests getting into college, although not at first.\n\nI work in a super high stress job, where if I mess up that\u2019s potentially millions in lost revenue. You know what it doesn\u2019t feel like? Taking the SAT, which triggered my anxiety so much more than this job ever has.

I can answer this one.\n\n**TL:DR** Test anxiety doesn't equate to anxiety in other situations.\n\nAs a child, my parents were busy preparing for my sister's funeral, so they left me with their friend, who took me to work with her.  She was upset enough about it all that she totally forgot about standardized testing starting at her school that day.  Apparently since funding is based on academic performance, the testing officials from the district thought she was trying to hide a potentially low performing student in her office.\n\nI got to spend the four hours before my sister's funeral locked in a supply closet with strangers forcing me to take a variety of academic and disability evaluation tests while I wept and hyperventilated with fear that I wasn't going to get to say goodbye to my last dead sister.  None of those adults listened to the explanations I gave.  My parents' friend risked her job to leave and let them know what was happening.  The test results they had from before my sister died, the ones taken during the trauma, and the ones given 6 months and then 12 months later were the subject of someone's PhD and 20 year study over at Duke.\n\nNow, about half the time I sit down to take tests with scantrons and similar, I have anxiety/panic attacks.  Yes, it's considered a trauma response.  In spite of that, I got a perfect score on my Reading portion of my SAT and a 30 out of 32 on the ACT before they changed to a 36 point scale.  Having panic attacks or anxiety attacks when faced with a test makes doing well *harder* and extremely unpleasant, but not impossible.\n\nAs an adult, my last boss called me the best engineer he'd ever had work for him in 20 years as a manager, and another boss straight up cried when I left.

These people suffer extremely, cause before testing, they know literally everything. My sister did her bachelor, she new rly everything, she was super prepared, we asked her in and out about the possible test topics, she new. But she has severe anxiety before tests, she literally vomits cause out of stress. And yes, test came, all the questions we asked her at home and she knew perfectly, in the test, gone, all just gone. Was a disaster. Couple of years ago. With therapy she got it managed in second attempt and is doing rly well now in her job. But the way till there was pretty tough. She had that in school already. \nAnd tbh, to be a surgeon would be no problem, it is the testing environment, the testing by itself which creates the trouble. My sister has to deal now with rly difficult cases and decisions and is doing super well, very stressful job and days and no anxiety.
