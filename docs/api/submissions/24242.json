Even a week\u2019s notice would be understandable just to give you time to mentally prepare to deal with him.", "Nta.\n\nSounds like a one sided helping situation. Tell your brother you need 10k tomorrow to help you out. See how quickly family suddenly won't help when you need it.", "NTA. You are willing to help but he doesn't seem to value that.\n\n>all of my relatives call me \u201epicky\u201c or say \u201ewe need to help in the family\u201c\n\nIt sounds as if he's got plenty of people who will do whatever he wants, when he wants. He shouldn't need you as well.", "NTA. You help him for free and he insults you? Yeah I\u2019d always be busy.", "NTA well, it was his decision to buy a farm and if he needs that much help regularly, he should hire and pay a farm hand.", "NTA, but I wouldn't conflate the issue with your brother's \"political opinions\" because it's not necessary or the point. \n\nThe point is that it's perfectly reasonable to ask for 48 hours notice to go and do work for someone. And it's not at all difficult for him to just ask 48 hours in advance. Just stick to that. No help without a respectful amount of notice.\n\nHowever, if you just don't want to be around your brother because of the way he speaks to you, that's also a reasonable boundary. But it's a different thing entirely from wanting notice.\n\nIf you stay on point with whatever your position is, it's clearer. No help without 48 hours notice, that's it, end of discussion. Boundaries work better when they're simple and firm.", "NTA - You have the right to set reasonable conditions for your help and availability.  Yours seem reasonable...tell him to pound sand.  Those are your terms to help out.  He needs to respect that boundary.", "ESH, I swear the fact grown adults can't just ignore topics that cause friction, and instead will run to total strangers for validation just reinforces how pathetic modern people are. \n\nYour terms were totally understandable, but the fact your family is split tells me you're not being totally upfront with how the interactions go.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
