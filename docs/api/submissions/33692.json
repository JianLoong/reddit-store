However, I was born and raised an Irish Catholic and since my teens I have been at atheist. My family are still very much devout. I will attend religious ceremonies however out of respect for others beliefs such as weddings and funerals and always feel very lucky to be invited to such intimate days. I wasn't always this way though. It took for one of my Muslim friends to invite me to her wedding which I did attend for me to realise that it didn't matter the religion or my beliefs or lack there of, what mattered was my support for loved ones. They all know I don't believe and don't try and push their beliefs on me, but still choose to include me in their special moments which I graciously accept without feeling I'm compromising my own beliefs.\n\nYou have to do what's right for you and if bring there right now makes you uncomfortable then stay away. But if you can accept going while being strong in your beliefs and ensuring your family knows you are going only out of respect for them and not because you've suddenly started to believe in God (trust me I've heard that before but luckily was comfortable enough to be able to laugh it off!) Then I would say go. But s nice alternative and compromise for you all is to maybe organise coffee or lunch after the mass so you can all be together and celebrate his life that way.", "NAH. I am agnostic now but before I was an atheist. I was in a similar position with my grandparents and family years back. I felt the same feelings you may feel about attending a service for a religion I didn't support nor believe in. Except their religion was protestant, Nazarene specifically. My grandmother put her heart and soul into that church. And the last few years before she died she asked us to please come on holidays, just so the family could all be together. But I would resist because it wasn't my belief. \n\nHowever, looking back I wish I had spent as much time with her as possible. And that may be grief talking. Personally, and this is not a guilt trip, this stating my own personal experience. I wish I would have gone more. It would have cost me nothing to stand by her side and sing some hymns and pretend to pray. She did many things to make me happy that she probably didn't want to do. Like attend every single sports event, choir performance, play, and etc. just so she could support me. It would have cost me nothing to support her since I didn't believe anyways. The times I did attend she knew I didn't believe but was just happy to have me by her side. \n\nI don't think you're an AH for wanting to stick to your principles. But I also don't think they are AH for wanting the family to spend time together, even though it's not something you believe in. If they were shoving it down your throat that you should be a practicing catholic that would be one thing, but from what you said it sounds like they just want the family together.", "NAH. Totally reasonable for them to ask, totally reasonable for you to refuse.\n\nThough, it depends *how* they asked. If they just asked simply one time, and you responded with a tirade about how the mere question is disrespectful, you'd be the asshole for reading way more into their question than intended and starting a whole argument during this sad weekend. But if they kept bugging and pestering you until you had to explain yourself more firmly and aggressively to get them to leave you alone, they're the assholes for the same reason.", "NAH - just go to your family lunch/get together after, and then you still get to spend your xmas with the whole family", ">it might be \u201cone of the last\u201d with my grandparents\n\nYou are NTA right off the bat because this kind of manipulation citing someone's imminent death is a major AH move on the part of your mom.\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if your grandparents hadn't said a damn thing about you going to Mass, and your mom just thought it would be more persuasive if she claimed it came from them.\n\nSend your mom back to your grandparents so she can remind them that they don't have much longer on this earth to learn tolerance and respect for others' beliefs, so they better change their ways before it's too late.", "NTA It\u2019s a religious service. It\u2019s a personal choice whether you want to attend.", "NTA - It's not like your grand parents asked you specifically or like they're gonna die during Mass. You're still going to see them. Happy Holidays, OP.", "NTA. \u201cOne of the last\u201d is circumstantial. You don\u2019t have to put your principles aside for it. Will your family be attending their last poop? Their last tax audit? Their last  protest against abortion?", "NTA.", "NTA \n\nWhy would it be meaningful if you were there against your will? Seems like it loses the charm if go because your mother strongarms you into it. Sounds very selfish of her and you need to shut down that conversation as soon as she brings it up.", "automatic NTA. its a personal choice.", "NTA. It\u2019s your decision what you do and what faith you follow. you shouldn\u2019t have to compromise that", "NTA - religion is a personal choice.  You can see your grandparents outside of church.", "NTA.", "NTA. You're a grown adult, she shouldn't try to pressure you into attending. And your mom should be more interested in you having *actual* quality time with your grandparents than she is in guilt tripping you into attending mass\\* (\\*it's not like you can *bond* with them during mass, at least without getting scolded for chatting, and they probably wouldn't do that with you during mass).", "YTA. They\u2019re asking you attend, not participate. Would you refuse to go to a family\u2019s wedding just because it\u2019s in a church? Get over yourself and spend time with your soon-to-be-dead family members.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
