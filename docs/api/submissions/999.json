My mom was fighting cancer at the time and my dad couldn't handle the idea of being alone after she died so he started to emotionally move on. Well, my mom miraculously survived and my dad broke things off with his affair partner wanting to forget the whole thing.\n\nDonna's mother was really spiteful over being tossed away so she waited until my dad was at his most happiest before showing up and dropping the bomb that he had a kid with her. My mom was furious and heart broken and almost everyone took her side. After the DNA test and court ordered child support was established my mom filed for divorce and got almost everything. Mostly because my paternal grandparents threatened to completely disown my dad if he wasn't generous. \n\nMy grandma adored my mom and my grandfather was ashamed of my dad, but he was still allowed to work at the family business. He just no longer had his original family share. My grandparents did this on the basis that if my dad died while Donna was still a kid they didn't want her mother getting control of anything on her behalf. Donna was welcomed to attend family functions but never with her mom and it was no secret how little everyone thought of Donna's mom. \n\nWell my grandparents have now passed and according to the will my dad only received $10k and the share that he was originally supposed to receive was reallocated to other members in the family. My four cousins and I each got $50k plus a share in the family business while Donna just got the $50k. \n\nWhen asked, it was stated that they didn't give Donna a share because they didn't want Donna using it to help/benefit her mom in anyway. However, since she was still their grandchild they wanted to give her something. I felt like since this was their money and assets it was their choice but Donna feels differently, and that since I'm her brother, I'm getting the most pressure to share. I refused because while our grandparents didn't give Donna a share of the business they did give her the $50k plus presents as a kid, paid for college, and bought her a car. \n\nDonna thinks I'm TA for not sharing AITA?", "created_utc": 1667441812, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ykpkkt/aita_sticking_by_my_grandparents_decision_and_not/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

None of this is Donna\u2019s fault. None of it. And she\u2019s as much a grandchild as any of the other kids. You\u2019re right. She is an adult. Yet she was excluded on the excuse that her mother would benefit in some way. Perhaps someone could have given her the benefit of the doubt that she could be trusted, because you know, she\u2019s an adult? What an incredible \u201cwe never loved you as much as the others\u201d from beyond the grave this will was. The fact that the rest of the family agrees with it is all she needs to know. She\u2019s not wanted. The whole family is awful.", "The reality she has to learn to deal with is that they (the grandparents) didn\u2019t love her as much. She was the child of marital infidelity and the sins of the father and all that. \n\nThat\u2019s her burden. While we can all feel sympathy, that and about $5 will get you a nice coffee at Starbucks. She needs to own her reality and work with it not try to demand that others accommodate her vision of an ideal reality."]}
