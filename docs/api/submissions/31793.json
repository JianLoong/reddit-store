Obviously dog breeding (disgusting) didn't solve their money woes, nor did them keeping more puppies each time.

No landlord in their right mind would ever rent to people with six dogs that aren\u2019t even house broken. And most will want vet records proving they\u2019ve been spayed/neutered/have all their shots. Which it sounds like they have none of those things. Definitely NTA. Time for a reality check.

They\u2019ve lived with your in-laws for a year with no plans of leaving. \n\nThese are irresponsible people, who will make your life miserable.", "These people are the worst kind of 'backyard' breeders. If they were legitimate about it, they would have secured a home and property to support the EXPENSIVE business of breeding dogs. There's a reason dogs from AKC certified breeders are so expensive. It takes time, space, food, vet bills, and hundreds of hours of manual labor just to properly house and care for breeding dogs. And you NEVER keep unaltered dogs with their siblings after a certain age because that's how inbreeding happens. And if you aren't training your dogs to toilet outside the house then you are setting them up for failure AND creating an unsafe living environment for the dogs and the humans.   \nAt this point, I would personally be the one calling Animal Control and reporting the unsafe living conditions. Fecal matter can contain all kinds of transmissible bacteria and if the dogs aren't properly cared for there could also be worms and other parasites. Untrained dogs, especially small dogs, are more prone to bite, especially when annoyed. They don't discriminate and will bite children if the kids are annoying or scaring the dogs.  \n\n\nJUST SAY NO TO THE WEINERS. Oh, and the dogs, too.", "NTA\n\nNo way no how would I ever let 6 dogs or even 1 move into my house. My sister has Dachshunds and they can be yappy dogs if not well trained.", "NTA... your offer is generous and I hope for your sake they will refuse. They will still destroy your home, without 6 dogs, because they have already proved they dont respect other peoples property.  \n\nGood idea \"No dogs:\n\nBetter idea \"No live ins\"", "Going with ESH.  Three dogs is three too many.  Six is illegal in many places too.", "NTA. I had to laugh at this one. I can't believe you have to ask the internet if you're in the right for not wanting your house, regardless of size, to not smell like a kennel. Stand up for yourself and just. say. no.", "Yikes what scummy people", "NTA, but do not let them move in, they\u2019ll never leave. They made the mess of their own lives, they can fix it.", "NTA, maybe that is the problem your MIL and FIL need to realize\u2026. People living off of you should not be living comfortably otherwise they will never stop wanting to live off of you!", "NTA. Anything you have to feed is not an investment. If they are \"keeping the cute ones\" EACH breeding, they are going to be swimming in p\u00a1\u00bf\u00bf & $#\u00a1t forever. \nYour home is full of your own family and pets. Good luck and congratulations on your incoming new family member.", "NTA.  Tell them you thought about it and they can't move in even if they don't bring the dogs because it will be too much with the new baby.  If you let those two slobs in your house, you'll have a terrible time getting them out once they move in.  Maybe allow MIL and FIL to move in with you?", "NTA. but don\u2019t let the people move in with you either.  They moved in with the parents because they couldn\u2019t find a place in time but now it\u2019s been a whole year and they still haven\u2019t found a place?", "NTA. Call your local humane society. Those dogs deserve better and with the inbreeding they are becoming animal hoarders.", "Not at all. Broke people can't afford dogs. They need to rehome them", "Most cities have ordinances that would never allow you to have 9 dogs so really, it\u2019s a moot point, you can\u2019t take the dogs.  \n\nBut to have 6 dogs and not potty train them!  I\u2019m sorry, those dogs are ruined and they\u2019re not a breed that would do well living outside. \n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nRescind the offer to BIL and his gf. Even without their dogs it will be too much. Once they settle in and get comfortable, you won't be able to get rid of them. If they're OK with letting their dogs pee and poop all over his mother's house, they won't have any respect for your property.\n\nYou had this house built for you, your kids, and your dogs, not for irresponsible family members. Your MIL needs to grow a spine and tell her son the dogs have to go. Instead,she wants to make it your problem.", "NTA. Even without the dogs, if you\u2019ve got a kid on the way, you don\u2019t need 2 more people. And you sure as hell don\u2019t need 6 Ill mannered dogs", "NTA. I would never allow 6 untrained dogs to take over my house. Your new house will depreciate in a  matter of months with the smells and damage. Do you want your baby playing on piss and shit stained carpets? Tell them to figure it out. Anyone who says you should be taking them in is welcome to bring that zoo to their house.", "NTA\n\nMIL/FIL can tell BIL & GF to get rid of their dogs if they want to continue to be housed.\n\nBIL & GF should - in the course of ONE YEAR been able to save enough money and have enough to pay rent somewhere. They could train and spay/neuter their dogs; they could find better homes for their dogs since they can't seem to provide the dogs a home on their own.\n\nThose are choices those people can make. If they don't want to make them; then they live with the consequences. You don't have to destroy your sanity or home for them. If they aren't willing to make the choices to improve their lives, then why should you sacrifice to improve their lives?\n\nDon't even let BIL & GF move in with you. They will never leave.", "Why are you even considering taking them in?  I wouldn't take them in without the dogs.  You're expecting a second child, and you have 3 dogs of your own.  You know they're going to be there indefinitely.  Why do you need the aggravation?", "NTA.\n\nIt's been over a year and they still haven't found a place, how are you meant to believe they are even trying to find their own place?\n\nShort Answer: They're not. They would just stay, just like they are at your ILs.\n\nETA: Backyard breeders suck and BIL and GF don't seem to care about the health and wellbeing of their dogs considering none are toilet trained or desexed. They need to learn how to be responsible pet owners.", "NOOO. NOT EVEN WITHOUT THE DOGS, NO! \n\nThey will never leave. They will turn your house into a shit hole with or without the dogs. SAY NO AND NEVER LOOK BACK. NTA.", "Your BIL and SIL are the AH.  They took in six dogs and got kicked out of their apartment as a result. Now their unruly dogs are ruining your MIL/FIL's home.  Stick to your guns.  You don't need a bunch of yapping dogs that poop and pee in the house while raising a young child and an infant, who will be crawling on the floor through their filth.  The solution here is they need to relinquish the dogs and find a new apartment.  Your MIL/FIL were stupid to take them and their dogs in.  Don't let anyone guilt you into supporting them and their dogs.", "NTA \n\nIf you need some argument ammunition, look up the code for your area.  I say this because that many dogs here would require both a code variance and a kennel license in a residentially zoned property, or just the kennel license in an agricultural zone.", "NTA. \n\nHowever Y T A to yourself and your child  if you let them move. They will bring the chaos - dogs are only a symptom but not the cause.", "NTA.", "SIX dogs? Lmao no, NTA.\n\nBut even if they didn\u2019t have SIX DOGS they didn\u2019t bother to train on no income, you still wouldn\u2019t be responsible for these two apparently able bodied adults who can\u2019t make a single responsible decision between them. \n\nYour in-laws need to evict them, they\u2019re taking the entire piss (and shit). There\u2019s no reason to make these failures your problem.\n\nIf no landlord will take them because they have SIX COMPLETELY UNTRAINED DOGS that are now incesting with each other then they need to get rid of the dogs.", " NTA and I love dachshunds. \n\ninbreeding is horrifying, this is negligent pet owner behavior. \n\nThese people aren\u2019t responsible enough to breed dogs . They should rehome some of the dogs and get them all spayed or neutered. \n\nNo, don\u2019t let these people live in your house.", "They\u2019ve had a year to find a house. Now they\u2019ve found it. Yours. \n\nNTA.", "They didn't found a place in the year they've been living there?  Ridiculous. They probably didn't even look. I would say no to all of them. Let them go live with gf family", "SIX DOGS?? nta but let me go read this post.", "NTA They have had a year to fi d a new place and didn't?  Once they move in with you, you will have to formally evict them. They just want to sponge off everyone else.

And of course they wouldn't tell that the litter is inbred, they're backyard breeders! \n\nThose poor dogs and puppies. They bred their dogs to get money, yet kept many of the puppies without bothering to get them fixed. I bet none of those dogs have had any health checks. Probably vaccines are the only thing they've done if that.\n\nDachshunds are a bit problematic breed, especially due to their backs. Unless very carefully bred, they're prone to back problems. It can be so bad that they can break their back by simply jumping. \n\nI bet that the mom/dad were not bought from responsible breeders. All of these dogs are so badly bred and prone to health issues. These dogs are untrained, but they could alse be in pain. \n\nThis whole thing is just such a mess. At least it shows people how backyard breeders operate.", "And based on that fact of not paying rent for a year... perhaps they should have a sizeable deposit for buying their own place... even if it's nothing to write home about.  Then they can do what they want within it's walls.... but the neighbours may have to call animal control about the dogs.", "This!", "This needs to be further up!\n\nBIL and SIL have no business caring for dogs.

Unless he was near my aunt, and then he'd growl and show his teeth and you needed to stay far away from both of them.", "I *can't imagine* why the lease wasn't renewed.", "And they said that they would be more comfortable at OPs house. Meaning they would never want to leave.", "> they need to live within their means\n\nSomething they clearly have no intention of doing.

Damage to property bad enough to constitute a public health hazard.  Bet all those dogs barked a lot too, so noise complaints.  Illegally carrying on a commercial enterprise in a residential unit.
