So I think you will see the schools get really conservative.

This seems like a rather alarming knee jerk reaction by the school to something so minor!", "NTA but, OP, piece of advice: your daughter is a junior in highschool. She's closer to an adult than a child and that's how people perceive her. When you use arguments like \"she is a sweet kid\" you come across as a blinded father.

At one point she called me a stinky idiot. Several days later we were taken out of class and she was accused of bullying, which was absolutely hilarious to everyone who heard because she was the sweetest little girl who would never hurt a fly. I tried to explain to them that if either of us was going to be a bully it would be me, but they didn\u2019t believe us and suspended her from using the school computers for a month.", "NTA because that\u2019s not bullying. schools in general just don\u2019t know to to properly handle situations of bullying so that\u2019s why they tried to get your daughter in trouble. you did the right thing by standing up for your daughter.", "Translation: the principal got in trouble with the superintendent.

The school escalated a minor transgression of using mildly inappropriate language (bitch doesn't even get bleeped on TV) in a one off scenario into a case of bullying to go on the kid's record (not that anyone ever really sees it) and issuing a one week detention. Next time the school officials will think about the seriousness of the offense and the appropriateness of the punishment so they're not embarrassed when they get called out for it in front of the board.", "The school will avoid doing things unless they are forced. You did right by your child. Forcing the principal and the school to do their job is not rude. They are just pissed you took control of the situation and didn't bow down to their word.

That aside, if the \"victim\" in the story says we are friends, this is just how we speak to each other, it should not have been escalated.

She was BAWLING and the other friend literally didn\u2019t care at all because they had been friends and had ate after each other plenty of times. Which, I think it would be fine if the teacher gave her a small lecture, but to write her up for bullying, getting detention, and having her crying all day was just a bit much. \n\nShe became a teacher lol", "NTA\n\nFight like a lion for your kids.
