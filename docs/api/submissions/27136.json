I'd this a religious school or something?", "INFO: Did you even attempt to fix this through the principal before going to the school board?", "Correct response:\n\n\"Its pretty rude for you to assume and not discuss this with the students AND parents together before even considering a mark on her record. Do better\"", "NTA. I'd be horrified if my kids used expressions like that, but it was clearly not bullying. It was simply rude and vulgar. And yes, sometimes you do have to go above the principal if you want action taken.", "Schools are under a huge amount of scrutiny for not actioning bullying. Kids have died. So I think you will see the schools get really conservative. It's better that your daughter get a bully mark than some other kid dies... \n\nUnfortunately detecting bullying isn't easy, it's not always easy for teachers to identify when kids are trying to avoid being seen as a 'tattletale' by saying they're not being bullied.\n\nI think it's fair that you tried to defend your daughter, but also keep in mind that the teachers and schools are trained now to see bullying as potentially killing kids, so they take it very seriously.", "Absolutely NTA.  This seems like a rather alarming knee jerk reaction by the school to something so minor!", "NTA but, OP, piece of advice: your daughter is a junior in highschool. She's closer to an adult than a child and that's how people perceive her. When you use arguments like \"she is a sweet kid\" you come across as a blinded father. Frankly, this type of arguments is often used by entitled parents who can't believe that their \"little angel\" did something wrong. So NTA for protecting your daughter, but take into consideration that she's growing up.", "YTA teach your daughter not to use slurs at school.", "NTA. Schools have become mindless hellholes where clowns make decisions without any basis for them. Good job dad.", "If you didn't attempt to address this with the principal before going to the school board, then you're kind of an asshole. But from your comments, you did have a conversation with the principal, who said that she understood the facts that you describe in the post, and was still calling it bullying. So in that case, NTA. You spoke with the principal, and she made her position clear. You weren't going to change it with further discussion, because she's not receptive to actual information.", "NTA\n\nLet them gossip. They'll think twice about taking unwarranted action in the future. And your daughter can be proud of having a parent who fights for them.", "NTA\n\nThey're salty, is all", "NTA. Context is everything and you stood up for your kid.", "They did the typical manager response \"if you have a problem please bring it to us directly\" which just means \"I would prefer to tell you no then get told I had no authority by my boss.\"", "NTA, stand up for you kid especially when the punishment is bullshit.", "NTA. Protections for bullying are warranted, but the schools tend to do this because they lack the resources or competence to do a thorough investigation. \n\nThe clue they f-Ed is admonishing you for how you went about it.", "NTA and you did the right thing.  What happened was not bullying in the slightest.", "NTA, once it was explained by everyone involved that this wasn't a bullying situation (which should have been obvious from the get go really), they shouldn't have continued like it was a bullying situation. Nothing wrong with going above the people who made the stupid call to get the stupid call reversed", "NTA.\n\nI just quit teaching because of shit like this. Admin usually has no fucking clue what real bullying looks like, how subtle it is, and when it happens.\n\nYou protected your child. She shouldn't be cursing in school but as a teacher that's more of a \"come on... it's school\" type situation than a big punishment.\n\nThe school needs to get their priorities straight.", "NTA.\n\nHowever you need to talk to your daughter about inappropriate language at school. They will mark her up every time. School did right by writing up your daughter. You did right by going above the principle, they love the 'Lets keep this inhouse' approach. Nothing ever gets solved that way.", "Ummmm no, it\u2019s just always been on Monday.", "Saw no reason to try since when I picked it up and talked to her she made it clear she understood the \u201cvictim\u201d explained it wasn\u2019t bullying.\n\nShe basically said your daughter is a bully and everything everyone said it didnt matter. Also the school board is just easier since they have hours for anyone to walk in.", "In this context it\u2019s not a slur. Bitch is versatile and can be used in many ways. Using it in a agreement way isn\u2019t a slur.\n\nWords are fun and they change meaning, bitch is one of those words that is changing. Like why gay meant happy and now it definition is completely different today", "We have a new principal and she is cracking down on everything and it\u2019s awful. Seriously give her a warning for swearing but that was just crap. Even though before no one cares about swearing and it\u2019s not a rule", "Tbh I checked the rule book and their is nothing against swearing just slurs. Also this principle is new and swearing has always been something they ignored so I am not even going to bother with that.\n\nShe gets the point that things are changing and to avoid swearing. But the bullying charge was bullshit", "This is a weird giant escalation for something that should have gone to the principal first for consideration. School boards have bigger issues to deal with and most kids would be embarrassed to have this made such a big deal - plus you made this part of a permanent record but going to the school board - tied to you'd child's name.  How is that helpful?", "So, you did at least speak to the principal before going for \u201cI want to speak to your manager\u201d. In that case, NTA. I understand the schools perspective, a lot of schools are being spoke out against for not cracking down on bullying, but it sounds like she wasn\u2019t even willing to try and get the truth about the situation.", ">I got an email today saying it was removed but it was pretty rude and ended with you can come to the school and not go above the principal if there is an issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Saw no reason to try since when I picked it up and talked to her she made it clear she understood the \u201cvictim\u201d explained it wasn\u2019t bullying.  \n>  \n>She basically said your daughter is a bully and everything everyone said it didnt matter.\n\nAw man, after getting the stubborn stonewall treatment from the school admin originally, I would absolutely be escalating that email with an email response, copied to the board superintendent/admin, basically stating \"I wouldn't have felt it necessary to go above the principal's head if the principal had given any indication of handling this situation with any sort of reasonableness or competency.\"", "Sounds like you tried to address it with the principal & were rebuffed, so NTA.\n\nI\u2019ve also seen school admin that want parents to come in for everything, they expect you to just take time off with no notice to handle something that should be an email.", "Keep going over her head and encourage an other parents you know to do the same. It's not like you can trust her to be impartial.", "isn\u2019t it a common sense that kids can\u2019t swear at schools?", "\"Bitch\" is a slur. I'm not saying the school is correct with regards to the whole situation, though.", "Is there specifically a rule against taking a shit in the hallway?  Or is that just common sense ?\n\nBy your logic, unless it\u2019s a specifically written rule then it\u2019s fine.", ">you can come to the school and not go above the principal if there is an issue\n\nI think the board needs to see the email with this statement so they can see that the school, itself, is guilty of bullying.", "It\u2019s never been a rule, kids swear. It\u2019s not even in the rule book so I truly don\u2019t care. She\u2019s not dropping slurs.\n\nShe\u2019s 17\u2026 she can say bitch", "I guess technically it\u2019s a slur but that one has been used in so many ways that context is really\nImportant with it. It\u2019s a greeting, it\u2019s a sass thing, and it can be an insult.\n\nSo people aren\u2019t really put it up there with hates slurs like the n-word.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t classify it as a real slur epically when used in term on the context of the post", "This.", "Oh, you are **that** parent.\n\nWell done.", "I'm beginning to see why the gossip is flying about you being an asshole.", "You're totally right. In this context, it is not.", "They don't put it up there with the n-word because women's issues aren't respected like men's issues are.  By your same logic, people regularly use the n-word in music as emphasis and as greeting, so it too would be appropriate to say in school under circumstances.  Yet I disagree and think neither should every be said in a flippant manner, particularly at school.", "What do you mean by that parent?"]}
