He won't drive or take the girls anywhere, doesn't work, doesn't cook, etc. So instead of hiring a babysitter, she has fully expected me to assume responsibility of the girls while she sleeps all day. Taking them to and from work, as well as taking her adopted kid (and usually at least 3 of her friends) to softball practice/games. I did at first because I knew she needed help but then it got to a point of her expectations being ignorant at best and me being fed up. Like her calling and asking me to go drop her girls off at the park or bring them to a friend's house or trying to convince me to take them to the beach with me and my kids every single time we went. Or an issue with them feeling entitled to using our kids expensive trick bikes or skateboards (my kids are in recreational skateboarding and biking contests). I'm truly just done with all of it. \n\nI started saying no about a week ago but she never stopped asking, despite me telling her I wasn't doing anymore favors. I would take the girls to work but that's it. Other than that, it's HER job as a parent to step up to the fucking plate and figure it out. Well, she came banging on my door yesterday because earlier in the day her adopted kid asked me for a ride to softball and I said no (bringing my kids to the beach) and she was pissed. \"You'll really let your niece miss out on her opportunities to bring your kids to the beach?\" In short, \"yes, I would\". She called me heartless and cruel and it was at this point that I said maybe she should stop taking in kids that she's just going to pawn off on everyone else because I'm tired of being her savior when she's a failure at parenting (she hasn't been to a single game, even before her shift change).

As harsh as your comment to SIL was, it's completely spot on. She's the one who has decided to take these kids in, she needs to step up and be the mom they need. She should have a talk with her husband too and get him to be even slightly responsible if that's at all possible. I know you're entitled to a portion of the property and finances may be a little tight, but the best thing you can do to remedy this situation would be to move out. Barring that, sit down with SIL's side of the family (everyone) and lay it all out. In about a couple of months you're not going to be able to be there for whatever your SIL wants because of the baby. If she can't figure out what to do, it's not your problem. She's an adult and should've figured these things out a long time ago.", "What's her husband doing? Why can't he be a parent?", "NTA!

Her kids have another parent that does nothing. It's time for him to step up and help with the parenting of those kids.", "NTA. Her problems are not your responsibility. You have gone above and beyond already. I suspect you might be willing to continue to help if your SIL showed a little gratitude and less entitlement.

What you said was harsh, but not wrong - you are more of a parent to these kids than their own parents are.", "NTA.

It sounds like she didn\u2019t respect your time to begin with and not saying no sooner your frustrations eventually piled up and you got into an argument and words were exchanged.

My guess is all of it.  Do the foster kids get to play softball, or just have jobs.  If the do have jobs what amount of their check do the get to keep, does SIL take any or all of it for their keep?  Then call child protection.  Foster parents like her suck.  She and her husband have them there for the pay check.

You\u2019re not the asshole for setting what is a very realistic boundary, but it sounds like you said some hurtful things to her. If your response to that is \u201cshe deserves the hurtful words because I\u2019m right,\u201d then that\u2019s inconsiderate.", "Hey this sub isn't for the poster to disagree with judgements.", "I think the point folks are making is that the children absolutely appear to have one negligent parent (SiL\u2019s husband) and one absent to negligent parent (SiL). But foster care placements, particularly for older children, can be FAR worse. Removing these girls from an existing support system (school, friends, activities, family aside from foster parents) runs the risk of severe mental/emotional upheaval AND them getting placed with TRULY negligent to outright abusive parents.\n\nSadly I can understand the perspective. In the town I grew up in there were a LOT of foster parents who took in older kids (10+) only for the checks and treated them horridly. It upsets me that folks have to see this as a \u201clesser of two evils\u201d situation but it\u2019s not unwarranted", "> These people should not be foster parents.\n\nI don't disagree with you in principle but it sounded like those tween/teen girls (a VERY DELICATE AGE) had been there for awhile and they're engaged in extracurricular activities, etc, etc - a change in foster placement is a real roll of the dice and their current situation AINT THAT BAD if we're honest here.\n\nLet's not throw those young ladies into potential sexual abuse or other instability just because their current situation is less than ideal.", "> only using them for the support money.\n\nThis hadn't occurred to me and I didn't get the opinion from OP's post that she was insinuating as much but... maybe?\n\nI don't know. I think pubescent girls are delicate creatures and their lives currently aren't THAT bad so I'd hate to risk their next placement in foster at the age of 12/14. Basically I don't think the current situation is great but it could be a hell of a lot worse.", "It is not the OPs job to decide if the current situation \u201cain\u2019t that bad\u201d. The foster parents are seemingly failing at their job of being foster parents. The system should want to receive feedback about that to provide support to the foster parents to do a better job or to remove the foster kids from people not up for the job.\n\nThe idea that we should accept bad foster parents because there are terrible foster parents is a shitty stance in my view. We shouldn\u2019t accept either of those things as a society."]}
