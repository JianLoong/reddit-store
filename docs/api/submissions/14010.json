You didn't ask any questions, just immediately accused him of not being as smart as his sister and jealous.\n\nYou could've handles his bad mood way differently. Of course he would assume you are saying that his sisters are better and smarter, while he is dumb.", "YTA. There were so many other ways to handle this and it should have happened years ago. Therapy and maybe highlighting the things your son is good at. Celebrating his strengths would have made it less obvious that you have favorites; and it\u2019s not him.", "YTA. This entire post, you did nothing but complain about your son and talk about how his intelligence level is much lower than his sisters. \n\nIn the post you have described, \n\n>He looked shocked and just said ,,Wow\u201c.\n\nOf course he did. He's likely never told you or led you to believe that he was jealous of his sister, and this is how I know:\n\n>I told him to quit it and stop disguising the real reason for his behavior. \n\nYou assumed the reason behind his upset. He likely just didn't want to be there. What 16 year old wants to go out \"for dinner\" with his 21 year old sister *on* her 21st birthday? Hell, I don't know a 21 year old whose idea of a 21st birthday party is a family dinner.", "Yta\n\nSo your son has insecurities about his intelligence so your remedy for this was to... insult his intelligence?\n\nWow, mother of the year over here. He's gonna be going NC with you 2 years, good luck with that.\n\nAlso, just because he doesn't do as well in school doesn't mean he isn't as smart. Showing your own intelligence levels are not that high by assuming this.\n\nAnd your husband was absolutely right for doing this in front of your son. He should know he has at least 1 decent parent.\n\nYour son does need to learn to direct his anger though. Not fair to go after his sisters when you are the problem.", "YTA.\n\nIf it was possible to believe that your son really did hate his sisters for no reason and that you have not encouraged this competition in some way, it might be an everybody sucks situation. But lines like this make me believe that is not the case:\n\n>  **He got his sister no present** (she bought him the collectors box of a video game for his birthday) and acted like he was forced when he said happy birthday. **He kind of ruined his sisters special day.** It was not the first time he ruined something in this way. But this time I confronted him.\n\nHe's a 16 year old being dragged to an adult dinner. It isn't really expected that he'd buy a gift, and to make that + being a bit of a downer out to ruining his sister's birthday is ridiculous. Given that, it seems that you do favor his sisters, even if it's only by being hyper-vigilant about him disliking them, and you threw that in his face in an extremely cruel display. Hell, it's possible that he isn't even jealous of his sisters, you just assumed that because you can't conceive of any of his actions except in terms of his sisters and their talents.", "yta\n\nmaybe ask yourself why he compares himself so heavily in the first place. \n\njust because he isnt as academically successful as his sisters doesnt mean he isnt as intelligent, thoughtful, or important. it seems kinda obvious why he and ur husband are claiming favoritism by your response. you see him this way, hence his insecurity and obsession in the first place.\n\nno idea why you thought saying that would fix his relationship w his sisters.", "Wow YTA\n\nI can almost guarantee that you celebrate his sister's successes much more than John's. You have a favorite and it is 100% clear to your poor son. He just wants you to be proud of him too", "YTA. Your poor son. He IS being targeted by you, and you DID imply he\u2019s stupid.

Let him explain himself. Let him vent to you. Let him know that you\u2019re there for him and that even though he may not excel in the same things his sisters do, that he\u2019s still so smart and so gifted and there will be things that he\u2019s better than them at.", "YTA and I guess we know who are your favorites here.  Your husband is right, you were the AH in how you addressed this and worse, calling his sisters smarter than him.  How awful and mean and degrading.  All your son probably wants is your love and support and its clear you give accolades to your favorites and look down on your son for not being as gifted academically.  \n\nPerhaps he is bitter about it all the time because you keep insulting him by giving accolades to your \"gifted\" daughters and ignore him and all he wants is some positive encouragement from his mother who should be his #1 supporter in his life too.  I'd be grim too if I was treated like this in my own family.", "YTA big time. Your son will forever hear those words from you every time he looks at you. You have now forever damaged his relationship with his sisters. He already knows you prefer his sisters to him but now he knows you think he isn't smart. He won't get over this and you can't fix it. The only thing you have left to try is grovelling and suggest the two of you get some family therapy. I had a mother who said something similar to me once and I can still hear every word 50 years later.", "Wow, YTA and a big one at that. You could've handled it way differently, but you've likely made your son's animosity and lack of self esteem worse. What a way to turn your own kid against you. Does it ever occur to you that you may have done or said things in the past that have given your son the impression that you are, in fact, playing favorites with your daughters against your son? You may not have done those things intentionally, but the damage is done. You are putting your son down instead of trying to lift him up. You could've said, \"Hey, what's wrong? I noticed at the party that you looked like you didn't want to be there. Can you tell me why?\" Then when he told you his reason, you could've said, \"I'm sorry you feel that way. You know your Dad and I love you no matter what. You will feel better about your accomplishments if you stop comparing yourself to your sisters. Not everyone excels at the same skills, and that's perfectly fine. You need to find what you do excel at and concentrate on that.\"\n\nInstead, you immediately went for the harshest reaction possible by yelling at him, telling him his behavior was disgusting, and belittling his bad feelings regarding his poorer academic results compared to his sisters. These are real, honest feelings that a lot of teenagers have. Your job is **not** to make those feelings worse or to dismiss them, but to try to help your son deal with them in more constructive ways that benefit him. Have you ever gotten him a tutor to help him with the subjects he may not be as good at? Have you ever tried to help him understand a subject or a homework problem in a different way than how the teacher showed the class? Sitting him down and working with him on his weaker points is much better than telling him it's ok if he's not as smart as his sister. What a confidence crusher.", "YTA.

I wouldn't be surprised if you made things way worse now for everyone.", "YTA By remarking they're gifted academically and he's not is demeaning. Great way to kill a kids spirits. Coming from a parent, your champion, the person you're supposed to rely on for understanding, comfort, support, and encouragement... you screwed up. You assumed what was going through his mind instead of asking why he behaved that way. Then, you basically told him he's stupid. You compared them. It's insulting.

It is often just a genetic quirk.  No hard work involved.  No special skill set to master.  \n\nI get where you are coming from, the son does need to put it in perspective and not be irrationally resentful.  It is HARD, if not impossible.  He needs help, and since you are not able to do this with him successfully, you need to outsource that to a professional. There might always be an element of jealousy and feeling inferior. \n\nIt is also super easy to fall into playing favorites.  Need to emphasize individuality.  It is hard to balance, as you can't let bad behaviors & intentional slights get out hand.

I will be very kind and hope that this is the sentiment you are meaning to get across, because it is NOT how anybody who has ears would hear it.\n\nBeing smart in school does not equate to being a smart person, either. It just means you are able to succeed within the parameters of the system and that can be for any number of reasons.\n\nYou are doing your son a disservice by saying his sisters are smarter than he is, because you are implying he is dumber than they are but also telling him he shouldn\u2019t even bother trying because he is always going to come second to them so why bother?\n\nYou need to apologize. You said a hurtful thing that is going to damage your child.

However, there are still other problems with your approach. Instead of accusing your son of jealousy, why didn't you ask him about his actions? Honestly, a lot of this sounds like typical sulky teen behavior, not jealousy. \n\nWe're also missing a lot of info. Did your daughter buy presents for your son when she was only 16?

I admire that you're trying to intervene in this situation because it absolutely is a problem that he resents his sisters' academic success; it's a societal problem when men carry that attitude into adulthood. But I do think in this conflict it's important to validate his successes explicitly. \n\nSoft YTA because you phrased it pretty hurtfully, but I understand where it was coming from and I totally get being angry that he made your other kid's birthday kinda miserable, sounds like u were pushed too far, still gotta circle back and rephrase/redirect tho if u want this to get resolved", "YTA.

We even printed out a prayer to The Goddess to hang on her wall.

There are many ways to guide him from competing that include showcasing that each child has their own interests to stymie the need to outperform. \nPersonally I never felt the need to compete with my brothers academically because we have opposite interests, however whenever jealousy or negativity would arise in regards to academics all my parents would do is take that child aside and share how they are gifted in their specific area and its ok to want to do better, but not to take it out on each other. Honestly this should have been discussions you had when they were preteens not when they are almost legally adults. I feel you completely dropped the ball to handle this on your own.

You tell them that they have talent in other areas if they question it. I have know people who were brilliant but had absolutely no common sense. I have known people who were thought of as not quite bright but could run a farm like nobody's business. Always, always encourage never ever discourage.
