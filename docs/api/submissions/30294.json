However, when BF separated from her partner a few years ago, A started acting out, and has been very rough towards R, but also dependent on her. He cries if he gets to school and she's not there. R complains about A, but still seems to be friends with him, mostly because he won't leave her alone. The teacher acknowledges what is happening but aside from suggesting that R plays with other friends, and seats them separately in the classroom, doesn't appear to intervene much. BF is in a bit of denial about the situation. She will force him to apologise when she observes the behaviour, but doesn't see that there is a bigger problem than each isolated incident.\n\nI would like to request they be placed in different classes for next year.
