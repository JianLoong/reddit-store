She has thrown multiple fits during the wedding planning process, has acted like a middle school bully telling my bridesmaids lies and trying to turn them against me, yelling at me over small things and is now just completely ignoring me. I\u2019m very lucky that my friends are smart and emotionally mature enough to see through her, but it is absolutely bizarre to me that this grown woman is acting this way.\n\nWell, the latest issue is her dress. She didn\u2019t like the colors we chose for the wedding and even though we let our bridesmaids choose their own dresses, she told me she wouldn\u2019t show me the dress because she doesn\u2019t \u201cneed anyone\u2019s approval\u201d and I just needed to trust her. My fianc\u00e9 spoke with her and she showed him a photo of the dress that was the right color but it was just a photo from the website. I have no idea what her dress actually looks like. \nToday I was told by a mutual friend that my SIL informed her she would be showing up to the wedding in a white dress with small light pink flowers on it (but basically white) and that I couldn\u2019t get mad because she is technically wearing the same color as all of the bridesmaids (which is blush and lavender). I told my fianc\u00e9 this and he said he\u2019s so done with dealing with her bs, that we just shouldn\u2019t say anything and if she does show up in a dress that isn\u2019t the one she showed him, we will kick her out of the wedding party. He said if she pulls this that she won\u2019t be in any photos at all, including family photos, and if she tries to sneak her way into any he will have the photographer edit them. My issue here is that I will be the one kicking her out because all of this would go down in the bridal suite.\n\nI am very on the fence about this. I feel like she is being extremely unreasonable and hateful and I shouldn\u2019t let her bully me, but I just don\u2019t want to make my wedding about her. I feel that if I kick her out it will cause some major drama and make the day miserable. My fianc\u00e9\u2019s family is very difficult and his mom and sister have made this entire experience horrible for me because we chose to have a small destination wedding without extended family instead of getting married in the church that they all did.\n\nWIBTA if I did what my fianc\u00e9 is suggesting and kick her out of the wedding party the day of? Should I try to confront her about this first or just let it go if she does show up in the wrong dress?", "created_utc": 1683674338, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13d9j9v/wibta_for_kicking_my_sil_f32_out_of_my_f28/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She'll leech so much from it if you give her the chance to indulge in her drama on the day. Kick her out of the wedding party now and be done with it. You wouldn't be the AH but you would be an idiot to wait til the day itself.", "NTA,\n\nHowever, you should kick her out of the wedding now.  If you wait until the day of the event, she won't leave quietly.", "Just kick her out now and avoid the unnecessary drama. Pulling a fast one and possibly humiliating her (deserved or not) might just make things worse. NTA, but if you go lookin for a fight with a crazy, you\u2019ll probably find one", "Just an FYI, one of the unwritten roles of the best man and groomsmen is to spill red wine on anyone who shows up in a white dress", "NTA\n\nKick her out of the wedding now - don't wait until the wedding day. This is going to be high drama and you want to dispose of that now. Your wedding day should be fun and relaxing. Don't bring this into your day.", "NTA\n\nWe desperately need an update on this though lol", "NTA - If your fianc\u00e9 is fed up with her bs why can\u2019t he step up and be the one to tell her? He shouldn\u2019t be putting this on you, he needs to speak to her himself and warn her that if she doesn\u2019t show up with a white dress she will be made to leave immediately. Not fair to be placing the responsibility of it all on you.", ">My issue here is that I will be the one kicking her out because all of this would go down in the bridal suite.\n\nNTA but you need to get your fiance to deal with this now, so it doesn't land on you. His wait and see plan is terrible and as you say will force you to be the bad guy on your wedding day. He needs to step up. His family, his problem to resolve.", "NTA. You and your fianc\u00e9 should talk with her and tell her because of her behavior that you both think it would  be best if she attended the wedding as a guest not as a bridesmaid. She probably will still show up in that dress even as a guest because she sounds like an attention seeker.

She sounds hella toxic and you have put up with enough. Yes waiting to the day of puts the burden on you. But maybe it\u2019s time to rally your other bridesmaids to be your support system in kicking her out of the crew if it comes down to it. My petty self would probably accidentally on purpose spill some pre party red wine all over her if I were your bridesmaid.", "NTA Do you really want this difficult woman in your wedding or even at your wedding at all? If you let her come she might ruin it for you.", "Look, there will be a lot of drama from what I see here, you are NTA but be careful not to find yourself crying on that day and your soon to be husband upset. It's a difficult situation.", "I mean I would kick her sorry butt out now if she is doing all the stuff you said.  She is going to just cause more drama and is that what you really want ? \n\nNTA", "NTA. She shows you the dress before the wedding, or she\u2019s out of the wedding party. Then have someone on standby at the wedding to escort her out if she shows up in white as a guest.", "NTA but how didn\u2019t you realize she would be like this? I assume you\u2019ve known her for a while and this kind of behavior isn\u2019t something that just materializes at weddings.", "OP I have a better idea.  Hire security for your wedding and give them a picture of her.  Then instruct them to not let her past.\n\nNTA", "Tell her to send you a picture of her dress now.   Then you can toss her out in advance.  NTA even if you have to toss her out on the day.", "YWNBTA\n\nBut, your fiance needs to do the kick.\n\nHe also needs to tell her that he knows she's got to wear the dress she showed him and if she shows up in any other dress she will be kicked out of the wedding.\n\nI would just kick her out now.\n\nSounds like your fiance would support the decision-- let him do it.", "Eh, just ignore her.  Her behavior is totally tacky, but that will shine through. Enjoy the day in grace and beauty.  Rise above this smallness and don\u2019t engage with her any more.", "NTA, easy way for him to do it is that he requests a brother sister photo as soon as she is dressed.  IF she is not in the dress she showed him then you can toss her clothes and other items out of the bridal while she is out with him and both of you jointly kick her out and have security escort her out.", "You are NTA right now but this needs to be dealt with now & you fianc\u00e9 needs to put a stop to it immediately. He needs to sit his parents & siblings down now. They are all out of the wedding party, wedding planning, and are now simply guests.

You are letting your SIL walk all over you for the sake of keeping the peace. This is unhealthy and will only contribute to further unhappiness down the road. Any reasonable person can see that she is way out of line, if the events described are what actually happened. \n\nI wouldn't even wait for your wedding day to come, I'd kick her out right now. Even if she does show up wearing an appropriate dress, what are the chances she'll start some shit at your wedding anyway? She clearly doesn't respect you at all. \n\nAnd if anybody else says something about this being \"unfair\" or that you're being \"selfish\", including her husband who I am aware is your best man, they have to go too. There is no good reason to have people at your wedding who will try to justify her gross behavior.", "\"It's gonna have pink flowers on it, idk what the big deal is\" - probably your SIL\n\nI'm gonna say NTA, but yeah definitely kick her now. Best to get all the drama out in the air before the wedding so that anyone wanting to show their asses over this will do it well in advance. A big scene on your actual wedding day would just ruin it anyway...\n\nOr like someone else mentioned, just let her join in and have someone spill a whole bottle of red wine on her XD", "NTA kick her out now. That away you can replace both of them. After she is there it will be too late", "NTA. You need to settle this before the wedding especially since it's a destination affair that she can't just drive away from (I'm assuming) if she's kicked out. Also you don't want your grooms family to flip their shit day of if she's kicked out.", "NTA. Kind of dumb including them in your wedding party. It's his sister not yours so she shouldn't be in your bridesmaid because of her behavior and fact that you are not close to her. I would uninvite her to the wedding", "NTA but either kick her out now or both you and your fiance have a talk with her in person and tell her exactly what your wrote her. Your fiance needs to take the lead and tell her exactly what will happen if she decides to show up in anything other than the dress she showed her brother in the picture. It won't be a discussion but her being escorted out, by cops if necessary should she try wearing any else or switching outfits for the ceremony and reception.", "Your fiance needs to step up and kick her out now. No time for bullshit games. Don't even risk allowing her to ruin the day. NTa", "OP, judging from this post and your previous post, your fiance needs to have a come to Jesus with his family about this. This seems your FSIL is testing boundaries to see what she can get away with and if she can steamroll you. Especially if your FMIL is also giving you grief.

It was just the two of us at the alter (with the officiant) and it was lovely that way.  I just wasn\u2019t interested in having four or five women in matching dresses to \u201chelp\u201d me get married.  \n\nNo bachelorette stuff either - and honestly, I think my sisters and friends were more than fine with my decisions.   \n\nEveryone told me how much they loved it, how precious it was, how meaningful it felt.  But I have not been to another wedding where the bride made the same decision, so I guess they didn\u2019t like it THAT much:)  For me, though, it felt perfect.", "Doesn\u2019t stop the drama. Lol. My oldest friend married in England (Hubby English. She & her family are from SoCal) and had about 10 witnesses, including her sister. Her sister threw a fit the day before and vanished. In London.

They lived out of state so I\u2019d only met her twice prior to the engagement, but they moved back about a month or so before the proposal. When we announced to our families in a group text that my fianc\u00e9 had proposed and I\u2019d accepted, she responded with photos and videos of her own proposal. Mind you, my family had never met her. I\u2019ve known she likes to be the center of attention, but I assumed that she would be happy being a bridesmaid and that would be it. I was so wrong. When we announced we were getting married abroad she told me she was so excited to be my maid of honor. I corrected her that my best friend was still my moh and she cried and told me I was being insensitive and that her husband was the best man so it\u2019s only right to have her as the maid/matron of honor\u2026 I could write a book about the shit she\u2019s said to me over the course of our engagement.
