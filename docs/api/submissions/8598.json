You\u2019re a really good parent for not forcing him to be uncomfortable for the sake of your MIL feelings.", "If your wife doesn't want her mother's gifts altered and mom is absentminded, maybe she needs to take it upon herself to call her mother ahead of gift giving occasions and confirm what the gift is.", "She does know, but she doesn't think it's \"that bad,\" and thinks she gets to decide that for other people.", "No, she's not. She chooses not to remember. That's very different.", "Yeah I agree in principle. But for OP, the grandparent is far less likely to argue about the kid's autism", "Yeah this is a good point. I would recommend having it out with your wife rather than MIL. Hopefully your wife will see reason and explain to your MIL", "I\u2019m going to get downvoted but I\u2019m going with YTA assuming this isn\u2019t something malicious that your MIL did to get him over his issue. \n\nYou should have returned them.  You could have asked MIL for the receipt or let her take them and exchange them for ones that work.  What would you have done if it was an issue the tailor could not fix \u2026 wrong size, a color you son hates etc ?  \n\nIf it is malicious  of course that\u2019s different", "I'm _not_ on the autism spectrum, but ADHD, and I definitely have sensory things, mostly tactile and sound related.\n\nMy sock/pant/shirt seams must be just right.  I can't stand anything that could potentially shift and feel tight around my neck, be it t-shirt or any other shirt.  Certain kinds of underwear are no-go.\n\nI'm glad this kid's parents made necessary accommodations!", "Don't see why he should apologise to her at all in that case. She should be apologising to all of them.", "Like... if I got someone a present because I legit forgot about a restriction, and their parent altered it so that it wouldn't go in the trash, I'd be embarrassed and grateful.  \n\n\nSo being annoyed does feel like a \"I bet if I just get them a nice shirt with collars he'll get used to it!\"", "I completely agree, he's making the gifts his son got USABLE for his son, MIL needs to get her head out of her ass", "Then maybe she should  get evaluated  for dementia.", "Just keep apologizing and reminding her why you removed the collars. It\u2019s not her fault she can\u2019t remember and you have to be as gentle as possible with people who are losing their memory. It\u2019s hard on both sides.", "There is literally no reason for OP to apologize. None.", "Sure, but sometimes an \"I'm sorry\" cushion helps reminders be accepted better, like \"I'm sorry, but \\[son\\] can only handle wearing non-collared shirts, so any shirts with collars he receives needs to be tailored to remove them so he can actually enjoy them.\"\n\nThis, in my experience, is especially true with people who are beginning to experience memory issues, since people who are at the stage of suspecting that they have memory issues but don't know it yet (either formally through a diagnosis or informally) tend to get *super* defensive and/or angry when something comes up that they should remember and don't.\n\nIn other words: sometimes people do things without reason, for other, more compassionate reasons. That's fine.", "OP has no reason to utter the word \"sorry\". None at all.", "NTA.  Your actions were thoughtful and practical.  Alarming that your wife is siding with her mom when she should always be on her son's side.  MIL furious over altering a gift?  A GIFT?  I'd have a conversation with her that your son, with special/sensory needs, \"hates collared shirts.\"  The gift was thoughtful, the shirts were very nice, but they were so special that you wanted to ensure your son would wear them.   You are a good dad - mom needs to get on board.", "NTA dude as an autistic person i think what you did was awesome and so kind to your child I dont get why they got mad at you, its was your child's gift and you made them so he could wear them :)", "NTA", "NTA - This is one of those situations where you\u2019re damned if you do and damned if you don\u2019t with a mother-in-law like that. Pretty sure she\u2019d get upset the shirts would hang in the closest unworn if they weren\u2019t altered. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA, does your MIL know he doesn't like collared shirts?", "NTA\n\nOnce the shirt is gifted to him, it's his.  You are allowed to have it tailored to suit his needs.", "Your wife\u2019s mother shouldn\u2019t buy presents anymore if she\u2019s going to cry like this. Maybe she doesn\u2019t understand how society works. Tell your mother in law to get a new hobby or something", "NTA\n\nIt's rude to give a gift you know won't be liked. She is the offender. Not you.", "NTA. If anything, you should be proud of yourself for caring about your sons sensory issues and your MILs gift enough to make it wearable.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. Reply to MIL:\n\u201cThank you so much for this shirt for son. He loves you so much and is always so excited when you get him gifts. Autism still makes it hard for him to wear some clothes as-is, so we decided to invest in alterations so he can wear it whenever he wants. Doesn\u2019t he look so handsome in the outfit you bought him?\u201d", "NTA. It would have been way more rude to refuse accepting it. Instead you took the gift graciously and altered it to accommodate your son so that he could actually use the shirts.\n\nSensory issue\u2019s aren\u2019t just annoying, they can range from uncomfortable to painful. Good on you for having your son\u2019s back.", "NTA you're just looking out for your son's needs. Tell MIL to stand by construction without ear protection for 8 to 10 hours. This should simulate the distraction or pain your son is going through.", "NTA. And I\u2019m not apologizing for making my son comfortable. She should be happy he\u2019s able to wear them.", "NTA.  A gift is the property of the recipient, and your MIL is old enough to know that.  She is also old enough to keep certain things out of her mouth.  Your wife is paying too much attention to feelings that her mother had no right to put on her, you, or your son.\n\nETA: Also, I am autistic and collars drive me bonkers--something I had forgotten until just now because, as an adult, I chose to have everything I wear altered so that it doesn't bug me in the neck, so I don't even have to think about it anymore, I just get it done.  I know that feeling very well.  It is very kind and thoughtful of you to protect your son from the slow-drip torment of always feeling something brushing against his neck.  It is difficult to describe how crazy-making it can be to an allistic person.  It's like being the new best friend of an unswattable insect.", "NTA...you did what you needed to make clothes comfy for your son. You will never be in the wrong for advocating for your son. Your wife and mil are one for putting their wants and needs ahead of your son.", "NTA at all", "NTA\nYou did the right thing", "NTA. This is no different than getting a kid the wrong size. Instead of it going to waste, you fixed it at your own expense. She should be sorry she fucked up and bought an unusable gift that you had to pay to fix before your son could use it. And if she truly has memory problems bad enough that she can't remember things like \"no collars\" then she should be happy to work with you by purchasing off of a pre-approved itemized wish list of items, or just gifting cash.", "NTA. If MIL paid any attention to your child's actual needs she would have not given collared shirts, or if she did she would have offered to pay the cost of having the collars removed. It is not rude to alter a gift so it can be used. It's rude to demand people use unsuitable gifts.", "NTA. You MIL would probably also have argued when he would have worn another shirt. She probably just wants him \"to look proper\"... Maybe try educating her what this in his  autism means. Like... Take a slip of tough sandpaper. Then ask her to feel it around her neck - it will be scratchy. And explain that this is a bit comparable to how your son feels collars. And that you actually liked her skirts, and wanted him to be able to wear them.", "NTA and I have to compliment you - I think this was a very creative approach and a great way to solve the issue.", "NTA. First of all it doesn\u2019t matter if the shirts were expensive cause he\u2019s still actually wearing them and it\u2019s not like you are gonna try and re sell them. It\u2019s not like her money is wasted\n\nSecondly if she doesn\u2019t want the shirts to get altered she should not buy him expensive collared shirts.\n\nThird, I wonder why she felt the need to mention how they were expensive.", "NTA your wife is being silly. Isn\u2019t it better he wears the gifts than you give them away?", "Your wife and MIL need to take a chill pill. You are NOT the AH.\n\nYou should be commended for respecting your son's choice. \n\nYour wife & MIL both need to stop griping over their hurt feelings. You owe no apology to MIL. However, MIL & spouse owe Son apologies for not respecting his comfort choice.\n\nToo bad about MIL hurt feelings, she sounds like an immature, selfish person. \n\nNTA", "NTA.. Does the MIL know that collars bother him? Shouldn't your wife have told her this? And if she does know.. Why would she buy him shirts with collars?", "NTA and from one parent to an autistic child to another: you are an awesome parent for accommodating your sons needs. Don\u2019t ever apologize for that.", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry - I thought I mentioned he can\u2019t wear those. I probably should have mentioned it and we could have looked into returning them.\u201d  \n   \nYTA because just saying \u201cwas furious\u201d means nothing - did she burn your house down or say \u201cdamn that sucks those expensive shirts I spent a week picking out weren\u2019t good enough, wish I knew. Anywho later\u201d.  \n  \nSounds like your wife has a bigger issue than your MIL.", "NTA. What's the point of your MIL not knowing about the sensory issues and spending a lot of money on something useful?\nI'd be annoyed and sad if someone didn't give me that kind of feedback. It's something I'd only do to strangers or people I won't have to deal with a lot", "NTA\n\nhad you not altered them, and he'd not worn them, she would have been offended. so she'd be offended either way", "NTA. If the shirt was a gift for your son, wasn't the point for him to use it? It wasn't usable in its original state and now it is. If MIL is offended, maybe give her the benefit of the doubt, explain the sensory issues, and say son really appreciates the gift, as do you. How she receives that is up to her.", "NTA. You know that if the shirts weren't altered MIL would be saying \"But why isn't he wearing the shirts I got him?\" She just wants something to complain about.", "NTA.   Ask mother-in-law if she'd rather the shirts never get worn, or she'd rather they get worn without a collar?  Remind her that those, and only those, are her choices.", "NTA. You are a good parental unit, seeing to your sons' sensory issues like a champ. You are not, however, resposible for your MIL's sensory issues being wounded. Bravo.", "NTA\n\n  \nWe get gifts for other people, not for ourselves. She needs to get over it. Also, how old is your MiL? I suspect this may be a generational thing where she doesn't understand that people can have major sensory issues. We are still trying to get people from older generations to understand the mental health problems of today. This could just be a thing where someone needs to sit down and explain it to her (though honestly I assume you already have).", "NTA.\nOnce you give a gift, the new owner of the item can do whatever they want with it. Biddy needs lo learn that.", "NTA, but why doesn't she know not to buy collared? Assuming she isn't an AH that just ignores a plain and simple instruction.", "NTA. It is not rude to alter a gift and wear/use that gift.  Your son is autistic and collared shirts bother him.  I am sure your MIL knew this BEFORE she bought the shirt.  Why would she give a Christmas gift that would cause issues if your son wore them?", "NTA. If the gift isn't about the one receiving the gift, it isn't a gift but an obligation. The MIL is selfish and got hit in the ego for not even knowing her grandson. I'm sure to most in his life, even the school, this is common knowledge. I know the quirks of those that I love... I'm not understand how she could be like that. And how could your wife not back you on that. Your wife put her mother's feelings before her own CHILD. So freaking wrong!", "A bit of a different point of view here ig: I can't speak for anyone else but how I was raised it is very disrespectful to tamper with a gift in this kind of way. If it was explained to MIL that the son doesn't like collared shirts, then she's the a-hole but if this was not mentioned to her then I would've left it in the closet only to be worn shortly on special occasions, or if absolutely unbearable, keep it in the closet and let the kid grow out of it and maybe take a couple photos with the kid in the shirt so MIL doesn't freak.", "NTA\n\nIf they were \"very expensive\" recent gifts, though, can't they be exchanged for something more suitable for your son?", "Your MIL is the a$$hole. At least your son is wearing the shirts and it was your dime that paid for the shirt alteration anyway. And she obviously does not know anything about your son or she would not have bought the shirts to begin with. Good Luck with your MIL, she does not sound like a sane person to me.", "NTA, good job respecting your sons sensory needs and putting him first.", "Aita has so many disabled people. I live in a bubble and never seen so many people with so many issues.", "She even took the clothes to a tailor to have them altered properly. OP you're doing great, continue doing what you do!\n\nMiL should be happy that instead of throwing the shirts out or giving them away you altered them so they would actually be worn. \n\nNTA", "Right. I'm sure it's been explained to MiL that he hates shirts with collars. If she still buys them that way and then gets upset they have them altered so the child can actually wear them, that makes *her* the AH. The wife should be taking up for her son, not worrying about her mother's feelings being hurt. OP, NTA.", "As the kid who needed the neck cut off every shirt, NTA.\n\nIf grandma is so upset ask her if she would rather her gift  never be used. Or suggest buying something that doesn't have to be specially tailored. \n\nI'm a 40 something and I still don't wear shirts with \"snug\" necklines.", "Well put.", "Sorry my reply reversed gender, missed that OP was Dad. Just replace husband returning gift to MIL to wife returning gift to MIL.", "Agreed! I have had this conversation MULTIPLE times with my MIL. NTA", "NTA, I don't like collared shirts either. I wouldn't buy button down shirts for a long time until I found banded collars. They even make dress shirts with banded collars. They are so comfy.", "Why would anyone in their right mind MAKE a dry clean only baby outfit?", "Why make one???", "An alternative you could have done is asked for the receipt so you could exchange the shirts for something he would wear. That way you don't have to pay extra money to alter them. (I understood the school shirts you don't have this as an option.)", "Some people use their forgetfulness to excuse their bad behavior. She obviously didn't forget that she gifted those expensive shirts but forgets that her grandchild is autistic and never wears collared shirts. That's awfully convenient.", "I\u2019m not diagnosed autistic (I have some suspicions though) and I HATE collared shirts. They\u2019re so uncomfortable and I don\u2019t know how people wear them.", " I would be embarrassed I forgot, then glad that you altered the shirts so he could enjoy the gift.", "Because everyday a pretentious person with too much money wakes up and looks for the dumbest thing to spend too much money on.\n\nNTA", "I work in retail. We sell some baby clothes (pretty cute, we have a designing team with great taste). One year we proposed 100% cashmere, cream colored pajamas for 0-6 month babies - you know, when most if not all of their alimentation is milk and - uh - runny poo happens.\n\nAnd we sold them. And we did our best not to say anything to the people who bought them, because we need the customers who are ready to pay 90\u20ac for baby pajamas.", "Well if you're targeting people rich enough to buy that and think it's reasonable...", "Money, Honey!", "Maybe just point behind her and shout \u201eLook! Shiny things!\u201c\u2026\n\nNTA", "They're evil. (I also have some suspicions about myself. Strong ones.)", "Or it has something to do with the fact she Mentioned how expensive the shirts are\n\nLike she\u2019s trying to show off by purchasing expensive brands and op having them altered will \u201cruin\u201d the value of the expensive brand item", "I don\u2019t have \u201csensory issues\u201d in general (no ADHD or autism), but I HATE tags in the neck of clothing.

Some people just have more money than sense", "Same.", "I mean, the baby would have been adorable... once. And for a couple hours tops. But it would have been adorable.", "Wow. I hope when you get older and start losing your memory people are more compassionate towards you than this.
