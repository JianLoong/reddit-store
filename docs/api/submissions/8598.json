Whether people understand the severity or appreciate it does not matter. When they express pain? It is cruel to not try and alleviate it. The fact that the clothes were altered to be kept and honored while tailored to alleviate pain was incredibly thoughtful, to both gift giver and his son. Being hounded for doing that rather than apologizing for  giving painful clothes items to a child with a neurological issue is cruel and heartless.

But you\u2019re right, make it known what a bitch grandma is because she is losing her memory. That\u2019s always a better solution.", "NTA, tell your MIl to stop wasting money on expensive shirts.", "NTA. It would be silly and wasteful to leave them unworn in a cupboard and buy new shirts", "The clothes fit the person, not the other way around. NTA.", "NTA.  Has your MIL met your son?  Or has she simply decided that she's getting what she wants to get for him, even if he will never wear it?", "NTA\n\nKids with sensory issues need parents who advocate for them and teach them how to handle life so they can do it on their own one day. Keep doing the great job you\u2019re doing.\n\nIf someone gifts me a pair of pants that are too long, am I NOT supposed to hem them so I can walk comfortably?", "Did MIL know about the sensory issue with collars before she bought the shirts? \n\nDid you ask if you could exchange the shirts for uncollared ones?\n\nDid MIL let you explain why you had shirts altered?", "MIL probably thinks you are \"coddling\" him and should be forcing him to wear the shirts with collars.\n\nFrom here on out just return them to her.  Just say, \"you seemed so upset when I had them tailored, I decided it's best to just return them, since they will not be worn as is.  Thank you for the thought though,\" then smile and wave.  NTA\n\nedit; forgot judgement.", "NTA. You're a good dad for respecting your son's wishes on this and it's great that you have the means to have the collared shirts taylored for him, thus reducing wastage. If your MIL is at least somewhat reasonable maybe remind her of his sensitivity to collars and that it would be such a shame for her gift to go unworn. It may calm her down and keep the peace. But tbh, she's totally TA for gifting him collared shirts to begin with, unless she forgot or somehow did not know, but both options seem weird. She probably bought them to make a point, which would be gross", "Why did MiL buy him collared shirts in the first place? Is she not aware of his issues? Or is this another one of those \"I know better than his parents...it's all just silly. If I buy him some nice collared shirts I'm sure he'll wear them\" things?\n\nNTA OP, for looking out for your son.", "NTA. Autistic person here. If something touches my neck for too long (even my own hair) I can get extremely worked up, upset, and my day is ruined. My solution to this? Cut my hair short and not wearing collared shirts.", "NTA  My MIL did things like that all the time.   She is a sweet old lady who feelings I don't want to hurt so I practiced killing her with sweetness.  \"Oh, my son stresses when something constricts his neck and they were such nice shirts I wanted to make sure he could wear them easily.  The tailor I used was so skillful in making the shirt look professional\"  I used phrases like that very often.", "NTA and MIL should have known about the collars and not gotten them. \n\nI\u2019m relieved this isn\u2019t about school dress code hassling him over not having collars. Some restaurants require them", "NTA - I would suggest apologizing for removing the collars without asking, but clarifying that all clothes for your son will be collarless no matter what, if anyone buys him shirts they are henceforth condoning those clothes can be altered to not have collars.", "NTA the point of a gift is for someone to enjoy it not for the person who gave the gift to dictate how it should be used.", "Absolutely NTA.\nYour son gets to enjoy his granny's gift. Would she prefer for it to stay in the wardrobe until thrown out bc he'd outgrow them?", "NTA. why is she more concerned about the money she spent on the shirts instead of her grandson's comfort? she should be glad that he liked her gift and he's wearing it, instead of focusing only on what wants. such a selfish person.", "NTA", "ESH - you for not giving the shirts back to her or asking for the receipt to return them, MIL for buying them in the first place since she must be aware of this issue. A collared shirt with the collar removed would just look odd. It would\u2019ve been better to just return them for something he\u2019d actually wear as it was designed.", "What?! Weird, why would she get him expensive things he was never going to wear in their original state. NTA. I bet MIL is of the mindset that you can force the sensory issues out of him. Sounds exhausting but good to hear you did the right thing.\nI think your wife and MIL owe you the apology.", "holy ESH\n\nno, it's not rude to alter a gift: when someone gives someone else a gift, that's it, it does not matter what they do with the gift in private.\n\nslight info on the wife: if she was simply relaying the MiL's requests/concerns, then she's not asshole, else she is\n\nas for OP, you are one not because of the whole MiL situation, but because you are not doing your child any favors by accommodating him in this way. you can in fact get him used to collared shirts or other kinds of uncomfortable things through repeated exposure. i know it seems odd, but if you want your son to one day be successful, then he'll need to get used to wearing formalwear (necktie and such), which is going to need a collar. so unless you don't think he's ever going to get a job interview, get him used to it.", "NTA. Since he wouldn't be able to wear the shirts, you had 2 options: have them tailored, or ask your MIL to return them for non-collared shirts. No apology should be required, but IF you want to be generous, you can tell her that you're sorry you didn't explain earlier about his aversion to collared shirts, but that they were such a lovely gift (lay it on thick, now), you couldn't stand the idea that they just sit in his closet unworn.", "Your wife and her mother are the assholes here. There is no question.", "NTA. There are 2 choices here: the shirts hang in the closet unworn or they are altered and used. I vote with you in altering them. No apologies required.", ">My wife said it hurt her mother's feelings\n\nYour son's sensory issues are more important that your MIL's feelings.\n\nNTA", "NTA, and you can get it in his IEP that he can wear shirts without collars at school", "NTA Even if he didn\u2019t have sensory issues tailors are there to make clothes you invested in into clothes worth the investment. Clearly dad here trusts the tailor he uses so it\u2019s not like they did a hack job. And it\u2019s really nice that he\u2019s using this resource to get the sons clothes fitted according to his needs. Hopefully MIL can be reasoned with, she might just feel a little insecure about her gift not being \u201cgood enough\u201d even though Son just has some special requirements to have the most comfortable experience.", "So... ESH?", "Yeah. If the neckline on my shirt doesn\u2019t go down some on my shirt I can\u2019t wear it. Doesn\u2019t need to be plunging, just not all around my neck.", "Yeah either tailoring or returning them to MIL. I can see why MIL may be upset if they didn\u2019t know so my response is probably NAH.", "I have SPD (sensory processing disorder) and to work around the collar material that was usually bothering me, my mom would have it lined in a material that I found comforting. \nWas a great hack!", "And disrespectful to the grandson and OPs family in general. There is absolutely no way MiL isn\u2019t aware of of the issue, and she still gave shirts that would ever get worn otherwise", "Same here. Used to love collared shirts all year round, now I only wear them in winter, otherwise my neck would give me some very strong opinions in the form of rashes... not fun.", "What? Wtf is wrong with you, are you even literate?\n\nRe-read the post I was replying to, you absolute schmuck", "Thank you, everyone on here is just begging to take offense.  my MIL gives careless gifts.  It doesn't mean anything beyond different generations value different things and she is getting a bit forgetful in her old age.", "That dog is eating better than me probably", "I'm sure it had a bigger room than my house.
