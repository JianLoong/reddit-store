I have an update.\n\nThe second day after the argument, my parents lovingly got involved. My dad is the wise old man and my mom is the perpetual peacemaker. So they invited my daughter and son-in-law (SIL) over a couple days into this argument and had a talk with them about the whole situation. They calmly listened to the kids and had a candid talk about the situation. My mom pointed out that being estranged and/or tense with the parents on her wedding day was not something that my daughter wanted. By the time the talk was over my daughter and SIL fully understood that they had been extremely inappropriate. \n\nThe next day my SIL sent me a very large mixed bouquet of my favorite flowers to my work. Later that evening they both stopped by to apologize in person. They brought a nice gift basket of some of mine and her dad\u2019s favorite things. They both realized the next day after the argument that they were rude and disrespectful when they understood that what we were doing and paying for for the bar contract was more than reasonable. They felt guilty for yelling at me, but were still angry that I made arrangements for the bar contract without them having a say in it. So they continued to just ignore our calls until my dad pointed out that I was well within my rights to do what I did since my husband and I were the wedding benefactors and I was the sole, legally responsible party for the bar contract. He also pointed out it was logical common sense to protect the budget; and the bottom line is that while it would have been a courtesy to include them in the conversation because it was their wedding, it ultimately wasn\u2019t their business how I negotiated the bar contract as it was not their money paying for it. And he pointed out that I had been more than generous and reasonable and did not screw them over or humiliate them as hosts.  And they realize that\u2019s true. \n\nSo this past weekend was the wedding. It was a beautiful wedding, a fun, happy day, and overall it was low stress and just an enjoyable day. At the reception my SIL nabbed me for a dance and told me he\u2019s very grateful for having me and my husband in his life as we\u2019re the good and stable parents he didn\u2019t have and he loves us both. He told me he told my husband the same thing while they we\u2019re getting ready. My husband was there, his dad wasn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t lost on him at what good parents we are to him too. \n\nAs for the alcohol/bar tab, we DID NOT go over budget by a long shot, and everyone had plenty of options and didn\u2019t go without. There was a total of one younger man who got completely wasted. He wasn\u2019t a fighter and wasn\u2019t causing any problems, he had his gf with him and they had a hotel room rented at the venue, so they let him be. \nA couple more people were fairly drunk but not troublesome.\n\nSo now, they\u2019re on their honeymoon and we\u2019re dog sitting their corgi.  All is good.\n\nEdit: the corgi tax has been paid. I think\u2026 I\u2019m not sure if I did it correctly. I believe I added the pics to my profile.

Kudos to you for managing all this while keeping your calm and staying present and affectionate.", "Good update.  Your actions were very reasonable, and I'm happy your daughter and son-in-law both apologized and realized the error of their ways.  Hopefully it was the just the stress of everything that got to them.", "Definitely happy for you that everything panned out so wonderfully.\n\nWait, you mentioned a corgi. I know this is an update, but... can we still claim dog tax (a pic of said dog)? :)", "Nice happy ending. \n\nIt took me a while to figure out SIL = son in law.

It's nice to see a good outcome.  Congratulations to your family.  \ud83c\udf8a", "Great teamwork with problem-solving. I am so happy this was resolved in time to have a happy wedding.\n\nWedding and family issues can trigger an irrational response.  I think this is what happened here with the groom and bride.  Kudos for you and grand-dad for lovingly guiding them back on track, while not giving in to their nonsense.", "NTA, the son in law is financially responsible....for his own money.", "Wonderful outcome!  Thanks for the update \ud83d\ude42", "Wonderful.  How lucky you are to have parents who are still with you and who can provide such sage counsel.", "Your family should have a TV show so we can all learn from you. Just Kidding,  don't mess with the beautiful life you've created. Yay!", "A wedding went off  with NO DRAMA ?!?!?! I didn't know that was possible after being on this sight for a while/s\n\nThis is a wonderful update, and I wish you and your family many, many happy years ahead\u2764", "how many times are you gonna mention how great parents you are tho", "Haha.  Me too.  I kept wondering why the SIL was involved.", "Thank you. I went back to the original post trying to see if SIL was ever mentioned in an edit. Lol", "I\u2019m only here for the corgi pic", "My ruling as someone unaffiliated with any of this is, yes! Dog tax should be applicable here especially since it\u2019s the dog\u2019s grandmother.", "That sounds really good.\n\nAnd honestly, I think their initial reaction was more or less hearing the topic with \"kid ears\". I think they interpreted you managing your budget as \"I, the parent, know better than you that you kids are too irresponsible for an open bar, so I am cutting you off before you barf, young lady! No discussion, the grown-ups have already decided!\".", "This proves that r/AITA as a whole is too prone to suggesting the nuclear option. She isn't a horrible, entitled monster who's too immature to get married, as the top comments are suggesting. She had a couple bad days. She was probably just stressed out from wedding preparations or something.\n\nWe all have bad weeks. Not one of us is always level-headed and reasonable. We're all assholes sometimes.", "Wow, you sound like an amazing set of parents and your parents are awesome too. Please give the rest of us tips\u2026 I feel like my family is dysfunctional.", "I think this is such a lovely update. You have a great sense of your kid. Your kids it turns out, have reasonably good judgement in friends too! Best wishes for the future.", "Glad to hear things ended positively.", "I do love a happy ending!", "Dog tax paleeeeese.", "I'm glad you managed to resolve it so that everyone was happy. I heard a tale this past weekend of a wedding where several guests decided to charge their bar tab to the bridal suite... Bride nearly fell through the floor the next day when she went to settle up", "Omg. THE DOG WAS IN THE WEDDING. So dang cute", "Thanks for the update!\n\nAnd your grand father sounds awesome :D. The voice of reason and fairness itself", "That is a great update. Thanks for paying the tax. Cute dog", "Thank you for the update. Glad everything ended well and the wedding went well. \n\n\nYou're an awesome parent, OP. Also, that corgi is adorable.", "You guys are amazing parents, I\u2019m sorry that you even had to bother with this situation which became a non-issue at the end. I\u2019m glad your daughter & SIL now realize how lucky they are with you in their lives.", "YAY!", "Wonderful news! So glad it all worked out & they realize exactly how fortunate they really are!", "Yay \ud83e\udd73 \n\nI'm glad it all went well and everyone ended up happy with the final event. Also, I love your parents. I was worried when you said your dad was wise and your mom a peacemaker because I thought it was sarcastic but no, they're really just that \u2665\ufe0f\n\nAlso their corgi is so cute, I just want to boop his nose !", "Glad it worked out well. \n\nYou absolutely need controls on the bar budget at a wedding because there are always a handful of people who will attempt to drink the entire top shelf dry if they know it\u2019s free for them. \n\nAt my wedding we said beer and basic wines were covered up to a limit. Anyone who wanted spirits or expensive wine was welcome to pay bar prices. We had zero complaints.", "Shucks, when I read the title I thought this was an update to the one where the dad refused to sign the contract for an open bar, the bride & groom signed the contract themselves, and then there was wild debauchery including sex in a closet, intentional damage to the venue, and DUIs that couldn't even make it out of the parking lot without sideswiping several cars and police had to be called. It wasn't until I read \"my husband\" in this post that I realize this wasn't that one (which was written by the father of one of the newlyweds).\n\nAnd now that I see this (much more realistic) story was posted only a few days before that one, I suspect that the more egregious one was fiction. Double disappointment.

I don\u2019t think we could have handled another drama so close after this one. Especially if it tied into alcohol consumption considering the original disagreement.", "Yes. I know both of them to be really good people, as I said in my original post. Still, I understand that as the parent, it\u2019s easy to have blinders on sometimes, and only want to see the good in your children. In this case, I\u2019d like to believe it was just stress, and pre wedding nerves and just a out of control misunderstanding that led to so much more nonsense than it ever should have or needed to be. I still hold firm that they\u2019re truly good people and just had a bad few days.", "Funny\u2026 nowhere in my update did I say \u201cWe\u2019re great parents.\u201d \n\nI did, however, repeat my Son-in-law\u2019s words that we\u2019re \u201cgood and stable parents\u201d. And \u201cwhat good parents we are to him too\u201d But again, those are HIS words. \n\nBut if that\u2019s your issue\u2026well I mentioned it twice. Shamelessly. I\u2019m not ashamed to acknowledge I know I\u2019m a good parent. Just like I\u2019m not ashamed to admit I screw up sometimes. But that\u2019s why I\u2019m only a good parent and not a perfect one, or even a \u201cgreat\u201d parent. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s any magic parenting tips that make a perfect parent or family member. Mine is far from perfect. But my father, the wise old man, is a psychologist, so my family has learned early on how to speak constructively to each other and to try not lead with emotion. That doesn\u2019t mean we always get it right, we fail too. Lord knows I\u2019m not anywhere near perfect. \n\nAs I stated in my original post, I may have made an AH move by just doing it without their involvement and being hasty about it the day after a disagreement. But we do at least TRY to react with love, compassion and patience. And we\u2019re quick to forgive and put it behind us.

Ive been to cash bar weddings and dry weddings and open bar weddings, but never an open bar that was limited so a certain dollar amount.\n\nHow do they announce that the previously open bar has turned into a cash bar? \n\nWhat if uncle Jimbo if on drink #12 and I go up to get my second drink and then set off the \"over budget alarm\"??\n\nEven if the bar is open and unlimited it's still the bartenders responsibility not to over-serve, so making the open bar limited doesn't seem necessary unless everyone in attendance is an alcoholic with a very high tolerance.", "Awww \ud83e\udd7a.
