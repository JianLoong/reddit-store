I have an update.\n\nThe second day after the argument, my parents lovingly got involved. My dad is the wise old man and my mom is the perpetual peacemaker. So they invited my daughter and SIL over a couple days into this argument and had a talk with them about the whole situation. They calmly listened to the kids and had a candid talk about the situation. My mom also pointed out that being estranged and/or tense with the parents on her wedding day was not something that my daughter wanted. By the time the talk was over my daughter and SIL fully understood that they had been extremely inappropriate. \n\nThe next day my SIL sent me a very large mixed bouquet of my favorite flowers to my work. Later that evening they both stopped by to apologize in person. They brought a nice gift basket of some of mine and her dad\u2019s favorite things. They both realized the next day after the argument that they were rude and disrespectful when they understood that what we were doing and paying for for the bar contract was more than reasonable. They felt guilty for yelling at me, but were still angry that I made arrangements for the bar contract without them having a say in it. So they continued to just ignore our calls until my dad pointed out that I was well within my rights to do what I did since my husband and I were the wedding benefactors and I was solely legally responsible party for the bar contract. He also pointed out it was logical common sense to protect the budget and the bottom line is that while it would have been a courtesy to include them in the conversation because it was their wedding, it ultimately wasn\u2019t their business how I negotiated the bar contract as it was not their money paying for it. And I had been more than generous and reasonable and did not screw them over or humiliate them as hosts.  And they realize that\u2019s true. \n\nSo this past weekend was the wedding. It was a beautiful wedding, a fun, happy day, and overall it was low stress and just an enjoyable day. At the reception my SIL nabbed me for a dance and told me he\u2019s very grateful for having me and my husband in his life as we\u2019re the good and stable parents he didn\u2019t have and he loves us both. He told me he told my husband the same thing while they we\u2019re getting ready. My husband was there.  His dad wasn\u2019t and it wasn\u2019t lost on him at what good parents we are to him too. \n\nAs for the alcohol tab, we DID NOT go over budget by a long shot, and everyone had plenty of options and didn\u2019t go without. There was a total of one younger man who got completely wasted. He wasn\u2019t a fighter and wasn\u2019t causing any problems, he had his gf with him and they had a hotel room rented at the venue, so they let him be. \nA couple more people were fairly drunk but not troublesome.\n\nSo now, they\u2019re on their honeymoon and we\u2019re dog sitting their corgi.

Kudos to you for managing all this while keeping your calm and staying present and affectionate.", "Good update.  Your actions were very reasonable, and I'm happy your daughter and son-in-law both apologized and realized the error of their ways.  Hopefully it was the just the stress of everything that got to them.", "Definitely happy for you that everything panned out so wonderfully.\n\nWait, you mentioned a corgi. I know this is an update, but... can we still claim dog tax (a pic of said dog)? :)"]}
