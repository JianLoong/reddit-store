But your husband has had 12 years to perfect lying to you. You'll never be able to trust him again. He could be lying about literally anything. Once a liar, always a liar.", "NTA, he lied. Plain and simple. Even then if he didn't straight up lie (which again, he did), he still admits that he kept it from you and a lie by ommision is still a lie.", "Why is he acting like he's  cheating just to meet a friend?\n\nNtA", "Nta. He\u2019s gaslighting you. Lying about being at work when he\u2019s out with friends?!?!", "NTA. It's a lie.", "NTA It is the lie here. Maybe I am missing something, but I see the lie and can\u2019t figure why?", "NTA  this is a huge comunication issue the fact that your husband has to lie to you in order to visit  a friend. And also is a trust issue because now everything he says you'll be doubting if he is telling the truth or not.", "update : Since its my first post, I didnt know how long it can be. Hence I thought I mentioned the imp key points here. So this particular friend works from home and hence in a couple of earlier incidents has called my husband on workday and they have got drunk during work. Since I also work from home and manage our 8yr old daughter studies and other activities. It gets really difficult if he gets drunk or hungover on weekday for me hence I have asked him to keep this for the weekend only. Also we both were very active people. But since we have moved to a new city for his work, His friends and collegues circle has increased and he goes out with them quite often and I stay at home as I have no friends or family here, so its not like he doesnt get to go out. And we both go on trips aswell. Him visiting friends and not mentioning about it even though we have had long conversations that day or next day is not something new. But I always brush it off thinking I don't need to know his whereabouts every minute. Also when I have been upset about it he has been very annoyed by stating he should not be worried about informing me everything and he needs his space and eventually we have moved on. But this is completely new to me that he is lying to go out. The bank visit was also him meeting the same friend. so this the second Friday he has lied to me about meeting his friend. Hope this clears a bit further.", "NTA.  He can't claim he doesn't lie and then lie by comission and omission.  I would be a bit concerned about others things he may be hiding and probably start looking into any joint finances, employment, and possibly other things.", "NTA- why lie if he isn\u2019t doing anything wrong? He is gaslighting you by blaming you as the reason he lies.", "NTA- your husband is dishonest and to make matters worse he is blaming you for i his dishonesty. I also would be very suspicious what else he has been lying to you about.", "NTA, why lie like that about a thing you seem cool about? Like you both are allowed to meet up with friends on your own, are you not? Maybe he did not want to make you feel bad by knowing he was having fun without you? But also 12 years of marriage would mean enough time to properly and freely learn how to communicate. It is a bit childish to make up a lie about such a thing if it was only not to hurt your feelings somehow.", "NTA, he was definitely lying. If he had no reason to lie to you about hanging out with his friend before, there may be something going on now. I always think of worst case scenarios but you never know if they\u2019re trying to set him up with a woman they like, or what\u2019s going on, if he\u2019s lying more than once to hang out with this friend. Hiding stuff from a SO like this happens most often when the person lying is doing something wrong, that could damage the relationship. Im not saying he\u2019s cheating, but I\u2019m saying you shouldn\u2019t trust him as he\u2019s being super suspect. Also, when confronted, he sounds like he\u2019s gaslighting, so this could really mean he\u2019s doing something that would hurt you.", "INFO - I\u2019m not trying to defend him here, but is there a reason he wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable disclosing the truth about this? Have you tried to convince him not to go? Have you given him grief if he has gone to their house? \n\nIt seems like you don\u2019t have a problem with the friend if they go for a walk around the neighborhood, but the fact that he feels like he has to lie to you when he enters the house where the wife is gives me pause.", "NTA and your trust is broken. If he's willing to lie about trivial things, you have to wonder what else he's lying about. Like what did he actually do during this \"visiting the bank\" absence.\n\nIt's at least suspicious that he's taking off work to do whatever it is.\n\nI mean, maybe it's minor, but you have no way of knowing. Best to prepare for worst case. Quietly see a lawyer, discuss divorce, see what's involved and what you'd have to do. Maybe nothing will come of this, but now, if you're blindsided, you're not totally unprepared.", "NTA  \n\n\nI was taught that someone that lies about something when the stakes are low will also lie about things when the stakes are high.  Healthy relationships are dependent upon trust.", "NTA Is his friend covering for him for something else? Is your husband meeting someone else? I hope it's not cheating.", "NTA\n\nDefinition of Lie- to make an untrue statement with intent to deceive. \n\nHe 100% lied to you when he claimed to be going to meet a client when he was actually meeting up with his friend. \n\nOnce trust is broken it is very hard to rebuild. Plus it seems when he was caught in the lie he then turned to gaslighting  you.  So you have some difficult decisions to make and difficult conversations. But from the fact that he lied then gaslighted you I doubt he is going to be willing to put the effort into rebuilding your trust.", "NTA- apparent I would say the not being able to lie to you is a very big camouflage.  He's had no problem lying to you.  And a lie by admission is still a lie. Lying by omission,  is lying and manipulation when it's done with intent.\n\nBecause for all you know he could have a side piece.  Is he visiting this friend that you don't get along with or is he visiting? God knows who.\n\nWhen I was reading at first I thought you were going to say he had lost his job.  \n\nHe is deliberately and with full intent lying to you and and misleading you.\n\nHe will need to admit to this and to see that before you can even think to begin to build trust.", "NTA - maybe. Yes, he lied. But I wonder why he felt he had to lie? Kind of sounds like we\u2019re missing that context.", "NTA\n\nIts the sudden distrust now isn't it? That is the utter let down. Would you have gone nuts if he had just told you he was going to meet this guy on his own? No, probably not, as you said yourself, meeting a guy best friend is not a big deal.....So  this is a major red flag, and worthy of having a proper conversation about communication and trust....amongst other things.", "INFO: what has been your reaction in the past when he has told you he is going to see his friend? Why do you dislike the friend's wife to the extent that you refuse to spend any time with her (as compared to tolerating her for the sake of your husband's friendship)? What specifically has she done to you?", "im not sure. when i was married my exwife kept me from my family. if it wasnt for me leaving early for school i would of never gotten to see them. alots missing from this. like why is he so scared to tell you hes going out with his family?", "Info: is there a reason he need to lie?

Got it.\n\nWhat is your answer to the first question?", "I see that lots of folks didnt read your edits and your concerns about this friends wife.   \n\nThe fact he lied means he has something to hide.   The something to hide could be that friend and wife are now in a physical relationship with him.   I get the feeling she probably wanted you involved too.   THis whole thing stinks to high heavens.  Time for hubby to fess up.", "Men and women both lie in relationships to smooth things out, avoid arguments, and yes, to cheat.  I'm sure you've told him plenty of lies in the 12 years you've been together.  But in this case you're NTAH.", "INFO: of he were honest about his plans to go hang with his buddy, would you have been okay with that?", "NTA- however, I will note that some people are so conflict averse that they'll do just about anything to avoid it, including lie. They don't want to get \"yelled at\" or \"get in trouble\" with their spouse. It gives me the ick as they are seeing the spouse more as a parent than a partner, but it is a thing.

Regardless, how are you going to trust him when he skips work, potentially losing incomr, to go drink? He is spending money, reducing income, and all without running it by his partner? You dont need to account for every dime together, but regular spending like this should be agreed on. His response is emotionally abusive. Just overall, not the kind of person you probably want to spend your life with. \n\nIf it is something you actually want to save, couples counseling would be beneficial, assuming he is willing to change his behavior. Otherwise, I highly expect that worse things are yet to come and perhaps now is the time to have things as amicable as possible if you don't want to continue with him. \n\nRegardless, telling someone you know they lied and it hurt you is NTA move.
