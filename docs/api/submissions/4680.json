The pizza base was not only made, but also rolled out. What she was asked to do is really, really basic.

She is doing her post-grad while also working, and being a single mother. That is a LOT. She took you in. She can't expect a little help now and then?

Force is sometimes the right word if you are defining it this way I guess. I would say expect my kids to do it. Sometimes they do things to care for themselves but sometimes for other people to, if you want to raise them as good humans. Being forced to cook every night is inappropriate.

Asking someone who has not done that ever is a bit much without more info.\n\nSandwich, yeah, agree on that.", "My only argument would be maybe she didn't know how to use the oven or was scared to use someone else's oven.

Since I'm a teen (16f) with almost no cooking knowledge (known recipes: grilled-cheese sandwich), I thought I should give some insight. \n\nThe main issue with cooking for me is that I don't know where everything is, and I don't want to go shuffling around in someone else's space. Kitchens are a mystery to me. But that kind of gets cancelled out by the fact that the daughter had her aunt on the phone. The logical course of action would be to ask where everything was and try to remember it as best as possible. If aunt could spare a little more time, ask what temperatures to put the oven, get the ingredients noted down if it was a big list. \n\nIf she couldn't do that last bit, Google would always help. She'd just have to search up a normal pizza recipe and substitute the steps with her premade ingredients. As for the peanut butter sandwiches, Google again if she doesn't know. \n\nAnother issue with cooking is stress; as a sheltered child myself, it was kind of drilled into me pretty hard that stoves and knives were death machines of doom. I am watched closely by my mom while using graters, and I was only allowed to use them after begging. Being in a kitchen alone can be a hit or miss experience - either kind of a 'oh no, what do I do' feeling or a 'goblin laughter' feeling. But none of these recipes seem to involve using any sharp utensils of any kind, unless she was asked to cut up veggies or use the oven without protection. And the sandwich only requires spoons: at least the aunt's daughter could have eaten. Better to have okay food than no food. \n\nOverall, YTA, because OP's daughter didn't even try. It just sounds like she didn't want to do it.

Pan is 350 for 20.  and that's just frozen factory boxed stuff that varies like that.
