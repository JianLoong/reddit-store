The pizza base was not only made, but also rolled out. What she was asked to do is really, really basic.

She is doing her post-grad while also working, and being a single mother. That is a LOT. She took you in. She can't expect a little help now and then?

Hell they get kids to do it in nursery here as a coordination activity. \nAnd honestly YTA for your reaction and for quite frankly failing as a parent to teach your child how to cook.", "> but a full dinner.\n\nThat is a lie. \nWhile pizza and sandwiches are a great source of nutrients, they are in no way a \"full dinner\". \n\nI'm worried about your dathuger. If she can't even make sandwiches, how does she feed herself? How does she plan to feed herself in the future?\nI don't think it's her fault, it seem nobody ever thought her. \nAs for your sister - she asked a very easy favour after giving you house. \nI would be upset too.\n\nYTA.", "NTA.", "Sorry OP but YTA.\n\nI\u2019d understand if Leah wasn\u2019t comfortable making a pizza from scratch or with premade ingredients but not knowing how to make a simple PB&J sandwich is where you lost me.\n\nLeah is 16. She should know how to cook some simple foods by now, even making a sandwich.", "Wow. Do you plan on providing meals for her for the rest of her life? What's she going to do after you die? Definitely the AH here.", "hmmm, if someone asked me to make a pizza,  never having done it before, I would worry about it as I have never made one - I am 55 btw - and have questions: such as how much tomato sauce, how much cheese, does it matter the toppings, do you care about (example) adding the pineapple over or under the ham? Asking someone who has not done that ever is a bit much without more info.\n\nSandwich, yeah, agree on that.", "My only argument would be maybe she didn't know how to use the oven or was scared to use someone else's oven. I dont even eat pizza but know how to make it so dunno I'm 50/50", "So there's a lot of replies from parents/kids that have known how to cook since they were young. Since I'm a teen (16f) with almost no cooking knowledge (known recipes: grilled-cheese sandwich), I thought I should give some insight. \n\nThe main issue with cooking for me is that I don't know where everything is, and I don't want to go shuffling around in someone else's space. Kitchens are a mystery to me. But that kind of gets cancelled out by the fact that the daughter had her aunt on the phone. The logical course of action would be to ask where everything was and try to remember it as best as possible. If aunt could spare a little more time, ask what temperatures to put the oven, get the ingredients noted down if it was a big list. \n\nIf she couldn't do that last bit, Google would always help. She'd just have to search up a normal pizza recipe and substitute the steps with her premade ingredients. As for the peanut butter sandwiches, Google again if she doesn't know. \n\nAnother issue with cooking is stress; as a sheltered child myself, it was kind of drilled into me pretty hard that stoves and knives were death machines of doom. I am watched closely by my mom while using graters, and I was only allowed to use them after begging. Being in a kitchen alone can be a hit or miss experience - either kind of a 'oh no, what do I do' feeling or a 'goblin laughter' feeling. But none of these recipes seem to involve using any sharp utensils of any kind, unless she was asked to cut up veggies or use the oven without protection. And the sandwich only requires spoons: at least the aunt's daughter could have eaten. Better to have okay food than no food. \n\nOverall, YTA, because OP's daughter didn't even try. It just sounds like she didn't want to do it. I am basically a kitchen decoration when it comes to cooking, but if someone was willing to give some direction to my useless butt I could, at the very least, make something vaguely edible.", "Probably can, but if that video has a different temp/time then whatever they're working with you're now out the ingredients and the time when it gets burnt.  It's not neccessarily common knowledge what those two factors are for pizza.  After all, frozen thin crust is 450 for 15 minutes.  Pan is 350 for 20.  and that's just frozen factory boxed stuff that varies like that.  Now granted teen probably could have asked if there were no instructions to be found but still it's not quite as easy as \"everyone knows how\" that a lot of people are making it out to be.  \n\nThe sandwiches on the other hand, if you've made it 16 years without putting some form of spread onto some form of bread I'm honestly a little concerned.", "And it's not even making a pizza from scratch", "Spreading sauce and cheese on a premade base is hardly a multi step process and still doesn\u2019t excuse her for not even fixing some sandwiches for the kid.", "It wasn\u2019t from scratch, there was already a base and sauce ready made. It\u2019s just putting things on the base and putting that in the oven", "According to OP's comments, it was not, because OP's daughter wanted to relax", "OP admits in another post that the daughter probably could technically do those things, but didn\u2019t want to.", "You are not wrong about weird ovens.\n\n But she refused to make a sandwich. The OP later commented that the daughter refused because she wanted to relax.\n\nAlso if you didn't know how to turn on the oven, she could have assembled the pizza, ready for the aunt when she got home.", "I totally invented \u201cpizza toast\u201d when I was a little kid and we just got our first microwave", "Dude I\u2019m almost 40 and have to Google how to hard boil an egg. I would feel weird and awkward starting a pizza from scratch on my own. \n\nNot everyone is comfortable in the kitchen.", "Nope, not unless you count \"remove from box, place in oven following Written Instructions.\"  Even today at 30+ I could not tell you the temp and time for a home made pizza, and doing it based off google or guesswork is Not going to get you a properly made dinner.  Best case you'll get an undercooked one you have to toss back into the oven.", "I understand her not wanting to operate an oven if she\u2019s never done this before (which is OP\u2019s failing as well but a separate issue that can be solved), but come on, she needs a parent present to show her how to do a PB sandwich?", "My 6 year old makes his own English muffin pizzas and puts them in the toaster oven.

Because reasons.", "Except that Google exists, and YouTube. Seriously, the kid can find a tutorial on pizza making in seconds.", "And it only takes a few minutes to prepare and toss it in the oven it's mine and my partners go to \"lazy\" dinner lol it's so easy especially if you have everything and it's not hard to look up instructions if you absolutely need them lol", "Jesus Christ fucking fuck", "Yeah, the not making a sandwich is a bit slack.", "You don't need a goddamn formal agreement to have your spoiled-ass daughter make a sandwich for the hungry toddler of the single mother who's hosting you ingrates.", "I also don't know by heart the temperature and time of homemade pizza. Yet, I just recently made homemade pizza from scratch (dough as well) based on an online recipe, and it was perfection. The entire family was satisfied.\n\nDoesn't everyone cook off recipes from online or paper cook books? If cooking based on them won't get you a properly made dinner, then what's the point of recipes anyway? It's not like you will cook the same things you know by heart your entire life. PS! Also 30s.", "You probably can even find tutorials for the exact model of the oven. I found one for fixing a specific problem with a specific washing machine once, because I wanted to do laundry and plumbers aren't cheap (and it was probably faster for me to do it on my own).\n\nWe live in an era of information, we need to use it", "thank you thank you thank you for writing that.

OP felt that Sarah was feeling annoyed with niece when she got home and layed into her.\n\nOP also made some comments about telling her sister not to have a kid because she was a single mom and it is hard work (not wrong), and basically implied it was her own fault she is stressed out now.\n\nSo her kid is 3, it then turns out in another comment the OP made that Sarah's husband died 3 years ago \ud83e\udd14 So not the irresponsible single woman she had previously portrayed Sarah as in the earlier post.", "Can she make toast?
