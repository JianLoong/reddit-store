OP's post didn't read like he drags them kicking and screaming out to the activity.\n\nHaving a summer spent camping and doing camping stuff whether the kids wanted to do any of it is totally a part of parenting.", "I think its super important to know where food comes from and how it gets to our plates.\n\nI know of a Quaker preacher with several kids. He runs a farm and when his kids turn 13, they have the option to learn how to slaughter and animal and actually slaughter a chicken, or become a vegetarian.\n\nIn our modern world, we are so far removed from our food. Many people are under the impression food comes from the grocery store. Not a farm, the grocery store. We forget vegetables come from the ground and meat comes from animals. This is a very real lesson on how food gets to our plates and its something kids need to learn from a young age.\n\nTo us, things just appear. We dont know the value of what goes into them. Be it food, clothes, furniture. We consume and dispose of things. Farming was a big thing in cities until the turn of the 20th century and commonplace to know how to handle animals, so not nearly as far back as the middle ages. \n\nKnowing how these things work make us more mindful consumers and its something we should all take the time to learn. Its wonderful her dad is teaching her these things.", "Not at all but if you\u2019re going to go hunting you should probably know what the reality of it is.\n\nI also think it\u2019s ridiculous that they bought a fish specifically to practice.", "If there WAS a zombie apocalypse I would probably WANT to be the first to die", "Maybe not, if she's used to living on tinned food... She'll be the one happily eating all the tins of unappealing stuff because that's what she's used to, while everyone else will be fighting to the death over the last fresh vegetables (and toilet paper, if covid is anything to go by).", "You could get very sick, actually.", "Facts. I was okay ish with fish sticks until the day my grandmother ate fish from her favorite place. \n\nY'all it still had eyes.\n\nI no longer eat fish. Or seafood at all.", "guess I'll stick to learning how to butcher spiders then", "Yep. Every skill other than breathing is \u201cnecessary\u201d or not based on cultural context.\n\nEven, for example, something as important as cooking. I mean, I know how to cook, and I wouldn\u2019t want to marry someone who doesn\u2019t know how to cook. But if you really hate cooking, you can arrange your life in such a way that you don\u2019t have to do it. Between snacks, microwaved food, and cheap restaurants, no one in a developed country has to cook. They may have to budget, and reduce their non-food expenses, but they don\u2019t *have to* cook if they really hate cooking. \n\nAnother example is driving. If you live in rural Texas you most definitely need to learn to drive. If you grow up in a major city with good walkability and public transit, you don\u2019t. You might be inconvenienced if you travel to rural Texas and you can\u2019t rent a car, but it\u2019s not a \u201cnecessary\u201d skill.", "It all depends on how often they cry. You might just as well say don't teach kids math because we have calculators now. Just because something makes a kid cry now and then doesn't mean it's not valuable and that the learning thereof shouldn't be kindly but firmly enforced. Playing an instrument, long division, gutting a fish ... valuable human experiences.

Glad I found a comment chain of people who grew up similarly.  My dad hunted, grandpa hunted, uncles hunted, stepdad hunted and I don\u2019t hunt.  \n\nI\u2019m glad they taught me how to hunt and how to clean an animal.  That you need to gut a deer in the field, but can bring a bird home.  That after a day of fishing, you head to the cleaning station so you have high quality meet.", "I think people are being way too harsh on OP. I think he's an *extremely mild* AH because he forced his daughter to do an unnecessary task she was clearly uncomfortable with. My philosophy is that kids should have as much autonomy as possible while still not being allowed to be brats- not wanting to gut a fish is not within the realm of brattish behaviour imo.\n\nBUT it is a good lesson and a useful skill nonetheless, so I can see why he wanted her to learn. And the people suggesting that it is a traumatic experience are hilarious.

The way they clamor to get out is horrifying. \n\nI have a bunch of nut and legume allergies and I can't get protein on a vegan diet, so I eat dairy and eggs. I feel bad about it. I'm trying to get my township to allow us to raise chickens so at least I know my eggs are coming from a good source, and I'm also trying to get more into oat milk now that it's readily available but I'm still too heavily reliant on yogurt and cheese to give up cow's products. Maybe as coconut products become more popular it will be easier.", "Just curious are you vegan on moral grounds or like health", "I can see how that would work. I feel like a person would better handle any disgust if they know they aren't going to have to eat the fish afterwards.", "I HAVE FOUND ANOTHER\n\nI've genuinely never found another vegan who doesn't mind handling meat/corpses, and now I feel like less of a freak of nature\ud83d\ude05", "This comment nails it.", "This is the comment that gets it completely right.", "Yeah, but it\u2019s also a life skill to confront your discomforts to get past them.", "BOOM!!!!!! \ud83e\udd47", "\"Buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo\" is a complete sentence with a verb, a subject, a direct object, and two adjectives.", "And humans.", "Honestly lol like why is this his hill to die on?", "Woah, woah woah, gotta weave some cloth first!", "Favorite movie ever", "True, puppers love bear skin rugs.", "My child dissected smelt with her fingers when she was three and put their heads on the ends of her fingers and waggled them.\nBut we didn\u2019t force her to.\n\nHow well does OPchild know how to swim?

Thats interesting. I grew up in unincorporated suburbia and this one house our bus drove past had a deer hanging on the biggest tree in their corner lot, every year. I just thought that's what hunters did, never thought of a shed. I didn't personally know any deer hunters so I know nothing of hunting etiquette.", "Is it really all that different from seeing roadkill? Sure, it's upsetting, but I wouldn't go as far as to say that kids will get PTSD from it. Maybe its because I live in a rural area, so seeing dead animals completely decimated in the middle of the road isn't uncommon (including dead deer). \n\nTo clarify, I'm not saying it's okay to hang a dead deer in a residential neighborhood, which I think is crossing a line. I'm just saying that most kids, at least where I live, are going to have seen dead animals on a semi-regular basis.", "They're going to see roadkill or a dead bird or something sooner or later though? Children see animal corpses all the time and honestly the body of an animal they have no connection to is probably one of the least traumatic ways to introduce kids to the concept of death.

And that's all that was being pointed out,  no one tried to claim there was no right to it.", "Came to say this, we were taught/asked to help with things like gutting a fish or dressing a deer, de-feather/pluck a turkey/chicken but never ever forced. Are these skills that I use daily? No, I even opted not to learn a few of these when I was about the same age as OPs girls because I just wasn't interested/slightly squeamish.

Knowing how to gut a fish isn't going to make someone understand global practices. It's a completely different level. The knowledge needed is different.\n\nNo, there is a very big difference between knowing something as in being able to put words to an idea and knowing something as in having a personal experience with it. Everyone \"knows\" where meat comes from, but in the western world, most people are so far detached that the thought of slaughterhouses and killing an animal is completely barbaric and foreign to them. Understanding something is best taught through a real world experience with it, so that you will actually understand what is needed, instead of just knowing the processes and steps involved.", "Not who you asked, but I'm a vegan for the ethical grounds and I don't really have issues with gutting fish. After growing up hunting and butchering kangaroos, and learning to cook surrounded by meat, the brain is very good at compartmentalising food and murder into two different spots.

We\u2019d go hunting and fishing from time to time. As a kid i would watch him do the work of cleaning. Then when I hit like 14, the rule was if I killed it, I cleaned it. Which I think is pretty fair.", "Agree. As a female living in a U.S. city I have had to shut off the water to my house, reset circuit breakers, and change a tire or a head light, (even used to change my oil when I was younger and more agile), but never have I had to gut and clean a fish.", "I live next to the ocean i never been told i should learn how to gut a fish...", "Seriously agree. Until I was 20 I didn't know tires and rims came separate. I had no clue what a shut off valve was let alone  where it was. These are life skills she will need more often.
