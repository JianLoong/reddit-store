If you eat something, I think it's a valuable lesson to understand what goes into making food into food.\n\nI hope that if your child decides that they don't want to eat animals, because they're not comfortable with animals being cut up and their guts removed, that you will be understanding, of course.

I know you can just buy food at grocery stores now, but it doesn't change that if you eat animals, they have to be butchered first.\n\nI'm always against forcing kids to do things that may harm them.

If seeing a dead thing is going to traumatize them because they're \"not ready,\" it seems like the intent wouldn't matter much. Again, I'm not in favor of hanging one in a suburban area, as I realize seeing anything dead is upsetting for most people.", "Idk what deer you were seeing, but none of the hunted deer I saw had massive holes in their guts. Maybe the hunters near you used different methods than my family has, because the deer they brought home were typically much less bloodied than roadkill.", "That's exactly my point. I will never understand those people. As mentioned, I don't have any particular interest in seeing either dead animals or watching when they are getting slaughtered, but I would never break down crying because of it. \nMy take on it is they are huge hypocrites who just refuse to acknowledge reality, because that would force them to make look at their own choices in life and maybe make an actual effort in order to be able to live with themselves. Reminds me a little bit of those \"tough, macho, manly man\" guys who reek of toxic masculinity and are overly homophobic, who later either actually comes out as either gay or bi, or just act true to their sexuality when they drink or are otherwise \"under the influence\". \n\nIt's rooted in the same thing, what we grew up doing/believing was right, can sometimes manifest as a deep internalized shame when we grow up and learn that those things were maybe not entirely true or maybe they were not the whole truth, and that shame is then projected onto the people who do live like that. \n\nEnglish is my second language and I'm tired so I hope it made sense, otherwise please let me know and I will try to rephrase."]}
