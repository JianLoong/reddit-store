Unless of course you\u2019ve somehow stumbled into a time portal and you\u2019re writing to us from some distant past.\n\nYTA. What you call a \u201clife skill\u201d is about as relevant to modern survival as knowing how to hunt with bow and arrows, unless you find yourself living on a deserted island.", "Neither does not eating a particular ingredient out out hundreds that will be available to her once she needs to worry about it.", "you know what also leaves you hungry? going home after NOT catching a fish... no wait, he went to a grocery store afterwards...", "In the scheme of life, it's really not though. Just because she currently lives there does not mean she will her entire life and additionally, I'd find it hard to believe that you couldn't purchase it already processed. The fact that that is the only thing you responded to as well, tells me a lot about who you are and what you value, which is obviously not your kids feelings.", "And if she asked the seller to gut it for her?  Or she decides to not eat fish?\n\nAlthough its a good skill overall its not a *life* skill.  Even living in a costal town, her life will not be significantly harder if she never guts a fish.", ">Eh, but gutted/processed fish typically cost more\n\nNot a good argument for OP's actions when the price difference is minimal to non-existent.", "It\u2019s rare to find processed fish here. Everything is usually whole since we live in the ocean side. Most stores only sell frozen fish", "Then why did you not let the youngest gut the second fish?\n\nAnd did you really make the 13 year old set up the family tent all by herself? That's just a shit move. Putting the tent up with two people is a 15 minute job, by yourself it's a hassle and probably an hour job. Letting her take the lead in putting up the tent is what you should have done. With you your wife and youngest following her directions. Even if it was just a small tent for the girls it would have been better if they'd put it up together with the oldest taking the lead.", "I'm 25 years old and never learnt how and I'm still alive :D  \nLike I said culturally it isn't very common we have a hole fish at home and we tend to get fillets and other cuts as its easier.", "Sure, we can buy our food. But that doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t know our meat comes from killing animals and that killing animals is messy, gross, and sad, even when you fully approve of the practice. And to be clear, I grew up hunting, fishing, and farming, so I do approve of humane slaughter. That\u2019s also why I believe respect for those processes is critical. Not just from a food safety and knowledge standpoint, but you cannot truly understand the importance and complexity of developing sustainable global practices if you don\u2019t know the most basic components necessary to feed people\n\nAnd we *do* need to know how to process food. You know that *people* are the ones processing it before it hits the grocery store shelves, right? The fish in the case and the freezers is ALL gutted and cut by hand before it\u2019s packaged. Humans are integral to the process. If we don\u2019t keep teaching those skills, one day we\u2019d all be like you and OP\u2019s kid and there would be nobody left to pack the fish because everyone left would be too icked out to touch it", "Much rarer and only for high end fish, if she want to eat fish she gonna have to go gut them. They are sold whole at the fish market, store only got frozen since everyone knows if you want fish you go to the market", "It\u2019s not common to find, most stores just have frozen fish and they are not fresh. Processed is more expensive and usually only done for high end fish, so unless she is getting an expensive one she will need to gut it if she wants to eat fish", "More of a philosophical argument than anything else. So much of \"life skills\" aren't strictly necessary these days.", "I find it hard to believe that you can't find a place to buy, say, canned tuna.\n\nEven if what you're saying is true, she can have beef or chicken instead.", "Luckily your daughter has the option to not eat fish at all if she doesn't want to. You're creating a false dilemma", "Too young especially with the knife control needed and oldest needs to learn that skill we live on the ocean. We all had separate tents so she put up her tent. I did my own and help youngest when she couldn\u2019t reach", "That makes sense! We have the option to do that too but most people choose to buy  fish fresh from the market because its cheaper. A lot of the time the fishermen haven't had time to clean the fish so we have to know how to cut and scale them ourselves.\n\nNow that I think about it, I bet there are heaps of life lessons that are necessary where you live that don't apply to me, and visa versa.\n\nI think that if OP live in a place like where you're from I'd change my judgement to YTA. \n\nEdit: words added", "> You know that people are the ones processing it before it hits the grocery store shelves, right?\n\nThat's a *job*, not a \"life skill\".\n\n> If we don\u2019t keep teaching those skills, one day we\u2019d all be like you and OP\u2019s kid and there would be nobody left to pack the fish because everyone left would be too icked out to touch it\n\nJobs can teach those skills.

The knowledge needed is different.", "If the only fish available to her requires her to gut it, perhaps she will choose to eat something else. The point is, you denied her a choice, so still YTA.\n\nYou remind me of someone I used to know who bragged about taking his reluctant 10yo son hunting rabbits. He forced the weeping child to skin and gut the rabbits. He too thought he was teaching the child essential life skills.\n\nI lost touch with them and don't know what happened to the boy, but it could well be similar to my grandmother's story. Grandma grew up on a farm, and had to kill and pluck and dress chickens. She was revolted by it, but was forced to do it. She grew up to become a vegetarian. This was the early 20th century when not many people were vegetarians.", "YTA  \n\nFIRST I  CALL BS  as to your reason\n\nI live right next to an ocean with several fish markets and I can buy directly on the docks as well.  I am not a chef but love to cook and never have I had to gut my own fish.  I tried it once, ruined a great fish with my lack of skill and decided to leave it to the experts so as to be able to enjoy my \"high end\" fish with no waste.  BTW most fish market will break it down for you if you ask and pay for the service.\n\nSECOND \n\nThis is not a skill you need to survive as an adult.  She may not continue to live by the ocean - she may choose to move as far away from you as possible for traumatizing her.

Is it a skill that could come in handy? Sure. Does she *need* to learn it? No.", "Okay, well that helps. If the tents are just one person tents a 13 year old should indeed be able to put up her own by herself. I know I was at that age.\n\nI'm still wondering why ten is too young to gut a fish. Is 13 the magical age at which you think they can handle the sharp gutting knife? Because the difference in fine motor skills between most ten year olds and thirteen year olds is not that significant. It can of course be for your kids and only you can judge whether or not they have the necessary fine motor skills, but I would then use that as my argument and not the age. I've known very clumsy 20 year olds who I would not trust to peel a potato with a knife without cutting themselves. Luckily for them there are potato peelers.", "Or perhaps she won't forever live in this area, but then again...maybe OP will force her to stay as well.", ">If the only fish available to her requires her to gut it, perhaps she will choose to eat something else.
