I\u2019m usually at home or at a friend\u2019s house where our kids are at a play date. Sometimes I get free times, like when my sisters come over so I can go out somewhere by myself, but it\u2019s usually just me and the kids because my husband doesn\u2019t really like babysitters; when Maya was 3 we left her with one and the babysitter banged her head (Maya\u2019s head), so he doesn\u2019t trust them. \n\nOn New Years (Sunday) Mike had a day off and on Monday, he drank with his friends so I had to take the kids to my moms to get them to bed (she was on holiday but I have her key and she lets me go there).

There seems to be a pervasive idea (especially among conservative men) that men who work bear literally zero responsibility for caring for the home and children. While I think it\u2019s reasonable for you to do the lion\u2019s share of the work here given how much your husband works, it is literally impossible to parent children 24 hours a day. You will inevitably need to participate in activities in which your children cannot be involved. If your husband is refusing to EVER parent your children while you\u2019re away, even with weeks notice in advance, AND refusing to EVER hire outside help, then what exactly does he expect you to do? Never leave the home without 6 children in tow until they come of age? Never take any time for yourself? That\u2019s clearly unreasonable at best, and straight up abusive at worst.

That's a harsh myopic assessment. This guy is working two full time jobs. With commuting, eating, sleeping, showers, and changing clothes he doesn't have a life either.

She's getting a lot more socialization than he is even though it mostly happens when the children are present. Playdate at your best friend's house > 13 hours in a trench with a digging bar.\n\nSome STAHs overly romanticize the employed person's working hours as joyful respites from the drudgery of domestic life. They seem to imagine that these long hours are filled with luncheons, birthday parties, office gossip, and adults discussing their innermost thoughts and feelings. They believe that workers are being heard, that they are appreciated, and their efforts are both recognized and openly valued and they are making deep lasting connections with other adults. For a huge percentage of working stiffs, this simply is not the case. \n\nWhen working as a union electrician, we had to drag all of our tools and equipment down to the job site (or up a lift on a highrise) and be actively working your ass off the second the shift started. We were digging trenches, pulling wire, carrying materials back and forth (always hustling quickly), up and down ladders, climbing into underground holes with oxygen being pumped in, and regularly had our hands over our heads for 8 hours.we carried unbelievably heavy load after heavy load all day. It is back breaking exhausting work. There was no chit chat. There was no conversation. You could never take a phone call or send a text. The only times that you weren't actively busting your ass was during two 10 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch which started when you set your tools down and ended when you picked them up. It often took ten minutes to get from where you were working back to your car. It is only within those 40 minutes that you can lean, sit, or stop to catch your breath. When our day ended, we then had to clean up the site and put everything away (typically off the clock) before trekking back to our vehicles and heading home.

My sisters and mom come over to help me sometimes though.", ">He never helps with the kids and you never help pay for the massive costs of your massive brood.\n\nThose are not equivalent actions. Not contributing financially is a default part of being a stay-at-home parent. Not taking care of your own kids is not a default part of being a working parent. And she is saving her family money by staying home with the kids. Whatever income she would generate by working would most likely not offset the cost of childcare for six kids.\n\nAnd her husband's family life is non-existent because he chooses not to spend time with his kids on his day off. It's understandable that he's tired and wants to rest on that day given how much he works. However, it's interesting to note that he can muster up the energy to drink with his friends but not to hang out with his family. I don't know where you get the idea that OP's husband's social life is more limited than hers. She only gets to hang out with friends who have kids while she has six kids in tow. He gets to go out with his buddies by himself every weekend if he wants.\n\nAsking her husband to watch his kids for a few hours while OP goes to an appointment after giving him advance notice weeks ago is not an AH move on OP's part at all.

Her job is not only physically demanding but also mentally and emotionally draining. Her husband would have to work 3 fulll time jobs to afford to outsource all of the tasks she actually performs. Clearly, her value to the family is worth so much more than money.", "You are the only one mentioning money. Her work has worth and value.  Pay for a nanny (actually 3-4 for 24/7 care), housekeeper, cook (who also does the grocery shopping), accountant (she probably sends out the payment on bills), escort (they obviously have sex), driver, personal assistant, etc.   oh, and do all of that with love. \n\nPlus, she only rarely gets breaks from the kids, to sleep in, alone time. He signed up for this parenting thing too.", "OP\u2019s a bang maid that\u2019s a baby factory, sadly.", "Fuck that, he doesn't want to be in a family or have kids. Exhausted or not, he too made a choice to keep having all these kids. \nOP also deserves a break, rearing children is also exhausting and they BOTH had the kids.", "Maybe if he stopped having kids he wouldn\u2019t need to spend most of his existence working?", "No, he's an asshole.", "So is she. They BOTH deserve their own down time."]}
