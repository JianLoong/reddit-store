Sometimes I get free times, like when my sisters come over so I can go out somewhere by myself, but it\u2019s usually just me and the kids because my husband doesn\u2019t really like babysitters; when Maya was 3 we left her with one and the babysitter banged her head (Maya\u2019s head), so he doesn\u2019t trust them. \n\nOn New Years (Sunday) Mike had a day off and on Monday, he drank with his friends so I had to take the kids to my moms to get them to bed (she was on holiday but I have her key and she lets me go there).

While I think it\u2019s reasonable for you to do the lion\u2019s share of the work here given how much your husband works, it is literally impossible to parent children 24 hours a day. You will inevitably need to participate in activities in which your children cannot be involved. If your husband is refusing to EVER parent your children while you\u2019re away, even with weeks notice in advance, AND refusing to EVER hire outside help, then what exactly does he expect you to do? Never leave the home without 6 children in tow until they come of age? Never take any time for yourself? That\u2019s clearly unreasonable at best, and straight up abusive at worst.

Playdate at your best friend's house > 13 hours in a trench with a digging bar.\n\nSome STAHs overly romanticize the employed person's working hours as joyful respites from the drudgery of domestic life. They seem to imagine that these long hours are filled with luncheons, birthday parties, office gossip, and adults discussing their innermost thoughts and feelings. They believe that workers are being heard, that they are appreciated, and their efforts are both recognized and openly valued and they are making deep lasting connections with other adults. For a huge percentage of working stiffs, this simply is not the case. \n\nWhen working as a union electrician, we had to drag all of our tools and equipment down to the job site (or up a lift on a highrise) and be actively working your ass off the second the shift started. We were digging trenches, pulling wire, carrying materials back and forth (always hustling quickly), up and down ladders, climbing into underground holes with oxygen being pumped in, and regularly had our hands over our heads for 8 hours.we carried unbelievably heavy load after heavy load all day. It is back breaking exhausting work. There was no chit chat. There was no conversation. You could never take a phone call or send a text. The only times that you weren't actively busting your ass was during two 10 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch which started when you set your tools down and ended when you picked them up. It often took ten minutes to get from where you were working back to your car. It is only within those 40 minutes that you can lean, sit, or stop to catch your breath. When our day ended, we then had to clean up the site and put everything away (typically off the clock) before trekking back to our vehicles and heading home.

My sisters and mom come over to help me sometimes though.", ">He never helps with the kids and you never help pay for the massive costs of your massive brood.\n\nThose are not equivalent actions. Not contributing financially is a default part of being a stay-at-home parent. Not taking care of your own kids is not a default part of being a working parent. And she is saving her family money by staying home with the kids. Whatever income she would generate by working would most likely not offset the cost of childcare for six kids.\n\nAnd her husband's family life is non-existent because he chooses not to spend time with his kids on his day off. It's understandable that he's tired and wants to rest on that day given how much he works. However, it's interesting to note that he can muster up the energy to drink with his friends but not to hang out with his family. I don't know where you get the idea that OP's husband's social life is more limited than hers. She only gets to hang out with friends who have kids while she has six kids in tow. He gets to go out with his buddies by himself every weekend if he wants.\n\nAsking her husband to watch his kids for a few hours while OP goes to an appointment after giving him advance notice weeks ago is not an AH move on OP's part at all.

Clearly, her value to the family is worth so much more than money.", "You are the only one mentioning money. Her work has worth and value.  Pay for a nanny (actually 3-4 for 24/7 care), housekeeper, cook (who also does the grocery shopping), accountant (she probably sends out the payment on bills), escort (they obviously have sex), driver, personal assistant, etc.   oh, and do all of that with love. \n\nPlus, she only rarely gets breaks from the kids, to sleep in, alone time. He signed up for this parenting thing too.", "OP\u2019s a bang maid that\u2019s a baby factory, sadly.", "Fuck that, he doesn't want to be in a family or have kids. Exhausted or not, he too made a choice to keep having all these kids. \nOP also deserves a break, rearing children is also exhausting and they BOTH had the kids.", "Maybe if he stopped having kids he wouldn\u2019t need to spend most of his existence working?", "No, he's an asshole.", "So is she. They BOTH deserve their own down time.", "So he babysits but you parent???  He needs to be told he is their father and has to act accordingly. Also stop having kids. It clearly is not helping", "He made those kids. He needs to be an active parent. Right now, all you're getting from him is money. Leave and put him on child support and give him weekends with kids. Or request 50/50 custody, no child support, and go to work, alternate weeks for with kids.  Let's fucking see how he'll deal being responsible for 6 kids.\nKids go to school/daycare, and it is up to him to organize childcare and pick ups  when they're with him. It's going to be on him to leave work if a child gets sick when he has them. It's going to be on him to make and keep all the appointments. And buy food to make sure they can eat. And keep up with housework. And so on and on and on.\nYou have a sperm donor with a bank account, not a partner and a father for your kids.\nNTA", "Your husband clearly doesn't think he has any duties as a father. 6 kids and no help? Sounds like a horrible situation. Please don't have any more kids. Take the steps to prevent this. You've basically had a kid per year, and that can't be great you for physically or mentally. \n\nYou need help. Either from your husband, hired help or family. \n\nSounds like your husband sees you as an incubator only. Hope your situation gets better.", "We always view these posts as outsiders to the situation and with our own experiences and ideas of what is normal we make a judgement. Firstly I will say NTA at all. Obviously.\n\nI look at your husband's working hours and to someone from my country they seem horrendous - over 70 hours a week? In many countries (if this is one job) this would be illegal as it's dangerous. So I really don't envy him that and it would make worry for his health.\n\nHowever, I also worry when I see 6 children, with someone who has to stay at home because their husband (who controls all the money) doesn't like babysitters (you said this in one comment) and who seemingly has no financial security, having been in this relationship since you were 18 and very quickly started having babies. \n\nThis person then does not take care of their children - yes we know he's tired from working horrendous hours, however, you are also working horrendous hours without the apparent benefits of getting to spend time with friends. You rely on your family for help with the kids (where is he in this and where are his family). \n\nWhy did you need to take your children to your mother's house on NYE? Why couldn't they stay at home? He knew he had to take care of his own children, yet was too hungover to do so. That's grossly irresponsible. \n\nMy comment is quite long but I was really struck by your post about the whole situation you are in. Unless you have some financial independence you are trapped in this marriage. You have internalised his selfishness so that you feel you have to walk on eggshells to stop him being angry with you. \n\nI hope you are reading some of these comments and they will help you to reflect on your situation and consider how you find a way out.", "So just to summarize - you are a mom of 6 kids at 28, with husband who does not help at all. I assume you are financialy fully dependent and have no job experience or degree with limited social ineractions as you husband does not help and you have bot time. All the kids managment as house is only on you? It\u2019s conservative and abusive peoples dream. So nezt steps:\n1) if you are not - go to birth control ASAP\n2) Get some finasial stability - seperate banking account or something like that\n3) Put a foot down on nanny helping out\n4) Think about some online esucation or degree\n5) Have a clear conevrsation with husband that this is not acceptable - he ALSO has 6 kids and he\u2019s basicaly absent from their lifes\n\nThis is just overall shouting as bad situation. Like - just bad. You are so dependent of him that I would be scared in your shooes.", "NTA\nI would suggest get yourself a full time job, then he has to pull his weight at home as he can't pull the breadwinner card.\nThen when you get around to realising he is an abusive AH and leave his ass you already have a job to support you and your kids.", "People here way overrate sahm lolol", "Definitely NTA.", "ESH. You guys have over extended yourselves so far and sadly there is no going back. Your husband is working insane unsustainable hours to pay for everything. You also have just have too many kids to look after with a house to take care of. You're both complicit in these decisions. I get some people want big families, but most don't realise what is needed to actually make it sustainable. You both need to have a sit down to figure something out, it's not hopeless, there are answers for you, but you need to sort your lives out now because it's only going to get worse if you keep on this track.", "ESH. Learn about BC and stop having kids with a man who obviously has no interest in being a parent. Your husband needs to stop being an absentee husband and father.", "You are NTA but if he didnt help out with the first one why would you have so many with him. U had 6 kids knowing his attitude. What's the point of complaining.", "NTA, and since you're the primary caregiver he doesn't get to have a say as to whether you use a babysitter, have heard this type of things from others and it always astounds me.", "Just a quick question. Are you a single mum or are you married? Because no, you didn't sign up to being A LONE PARENT. \n\nHe needs to get off his ass and step up. He helped create this family, he also needs to help out at home. Sod that he works to, it takes two to tango. He is Dad, he does his part too, end of.\n\nAnd if he doesn't, then yes, become a single parent because he is lazy, narcissistic and rather pathetic. Mum's deserve time to themselves also.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nYou work full time, and so does your husband. You both deserve time off. \n\nHe doesn't get to decide he doesn't want to PARENT your children when you need him. He isn't \"watching\" them. He is their father. He should be parenting them. \n\nAnd he needs to understand you're not a slave. You deserve time to yourself. \n\nIf he can't get on boars with that, then you need to decide if it is best for you to stay. And I don't say that lightly, I know how daunting that can seem. \n\nBut you need to consider the example you are setting for your children. Your sons are learning thisnisnacveptable behaviour and an acceptable way to treat their partners. \n\nYour daughters are learning that this is what they should accept and how they should value themselves. \n\nNTA right now, but if you allow this dynamic to continue, just for the example you are setting, I would say you're venturing to AH territory then.", "NTA. He is a much older man who has gaslit you for far too long. He has you buried in children from your late teens, and uses and abuses you. Can your family help get you away from this horrible situation?", "How is this ESH? Whether they have 1 kid or 20 he's as responsible for them as she is.\n\nShe asked for help *one day* so she could go to an appointment.\n\nAlso note *he* doesn't like babysitters which leaves her less support there too. \n\nHe's the AH in this case.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry but working is no excuse not to parent. I get his hours suck and he works all the time. I hope that his reaction was just because he was cranky. You give him all this time free because he has so little. He doesn\u2019t recognize you have less free time than him because he thinks your job is a cakewalk.\n\nYou had plans. He tried to cancel last minute which wasn\u2019t possible. He threw a fit. Being an adult means doing things you don\u2019t want to do. Do I want to play with my kids the second I get home from work while trying to clean and make dinner? No I want to rest. But that\u2019s not how life works with kids. Especially 6.", "What the hell did I just read? Is this real? NTA for having an appointment and wanting Mike to babysit for a little. This relationship sounds bizarre to me but if your ok with it and it works for you to each their own. Good luck with everything.", "Fy uh meet he lol loop l\u00f2", "Honey, you are not the asshole. Your husband if anything is the asshole, and I speak from experience. \n\nI had 5 kids by 26 and felt like I was alone for all of it until the last couple of years.\n\nHe could have changed his sleeping plans to accommodate you, instead of going off drinking with his buddies leaving him hungover. You don't even need to tell us he was for me to know.\n\nHe shirks his parenting duties to run away from home and leave you with the kids, constantly. Your reprieve shouldn't be my sister came over so I could shower. Thats not living. That's not being able to relax enough to properly parent.\n\nYou're in burnout and survival mode. \n\nYou need help from somewhere, and if he won't help you, get a nanny part time.", "NTA but it does sound like you two are a bit in over your heads. Is there any way you two could sit down and maybe rehash your situation to try and make it easier? Would it be easier if he cuts back on hours and you pick up an opposite shift schedule? Maybe instead of a stranger babysitting, you could pay one of your friends you trust? Maybe downsize on the bills if possible? Idk but this does not sound sustainable, short term or long term. Something is gonna have to give or be worked around. I don't know what the solution could be, but I really encourage you both to take a day (yea a day) and really talk talk. Maybe see if your mom would babysit or something one Sunday. Take the day and hash it all out, make plans, heck even draw out posters and graphs and calenders etc. Come up with a solid game plan, anything that can be immediately put into action, do so that day. Then take a nice long nap, reconnect over a date in the evening, pick up your kids and start fresh.", "op, you were groomed by an older man into becoming his bang maid and baby factory. you need to realize this and gtfo. you should\u2019ve never had one kid with him, let alone six, but the bad decisions have already been made. get you and your kids out of this situation before you make any more. and ffs, never have another child.", "ESH. God damn, 27 and six kids.
