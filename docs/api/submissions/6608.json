Sometimes I get free times, like when my sisters come over so I can go out somewhere by myself, but it\u2019s usually just me and the kids because my husband doesn\u2019t really like babysitters; when Maya was 3 we left her with one and the babysitter banged her head (Maya\u2019s head), so he doesn\u2019t trust them. \n\nOn New Years (Sunday) Mike had a day off and on Monday, he drank with his friends so I had to take the kids to my moms to get them to bed (she was on holiday but I have her key and she lets me go there).

There seems to be a pervasive idea (especially among conservative men) that men who work bear literally zero responsibility for caring for the home and children. While I think it\u2019s reasonable for you to do the lion\u2019s share of the work here given how much your husband works, it is literally impossible to parent children 24 hours a day. You will inevitably need to participate in activities in which your children cannot be involved. If your husband is refusing to EVER parent your children while you\u2019re away, even with weeks notice in advance, AND refusing to EVER hire outside help, then what exactly does he expect you to do? Never leave the home without 6 children in tow until they come of age? Never take any time for yourself? That\u2019s clearly unreasonable at best, and straight up abusive at worst.

Playdate at your best friend's house > 13 hours in a trench with a digging bar.\n\nSome STAHs overly romanticize the employed person's working hours as joyful respites from the drudgery of domestic life. They seem to imagine that these long hours are filled with luncheons, birthday parties, office gossip, and adults discussing their innermost thoughts and feelings. They believe that workers are being heard, that they are appreciated, and their efforts are both recognized and openly valued and they are making deep lasting connections with other adults. For a huge percentage of working stiffs, this simply is not the case. \n\nWhen working as a union electrician, we had to drag all of our tools and equipment down to the job site (or up a lift on a highrise) and be actively working your ass off the second the shift started. We were digging trenches, pulling wire, carrying materials back and forth (always hustling quickly), up and down ladders, climbing into underground holes with oxygen being pumped in, and regularly had our hands over our heads for 8 hours.we carried unbelievably heavy load after heavy load all day. It is back breaking exhausting work. There was no chit chat. There was no conversation. You could never take a phone call or send a text. The only times that you weren't actively busting your ass was during two 10 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch which started when you set your tools down and ended when you picked them up. It often took ten minutes to get from where you were working back to your car. It is only within those 40 minutes that you can lean, sit, or stop to catch your breath. When our day ended, we then had to clean up the site and put everything away (typically off the clock) before trekking back to our vehicles and heading home.

My sisters and mom come over to help me sometimes though.", ">He never helps with the kids and you never help pay for the massive costs of your massive brood.\n\nThose are not equivalent actions. Not contributing financially is a default part of being a stay-at-home parent. Not taking care of your own kids is not a default part of being a working parent. And she is saving her family money by staying home with the kids. Whatever income she would generate by working would most likely not offset the cost of childcare for six kids.\n\nAnd her husband's family life is non-existent because he chooses not to spend time with his kids on his day off. It's understandable that he's tired and wants to rest on that day given how much he works. However, it's interesting to note that he can muster up the energy to drink with his friends but not to hang out with his family. I don't know where you get the idea that OP's husband's social life is more limited than hers. She only gets to hang out with friends who have kids while she has six kids in tow. He gets to go out with his buddies by himself every weekend if he wants.\n\nAsking her husband to watch his kids for a few hours while OP goes to an appointment after giving him advance notice weeks ago is not an AH move on OP's part at all.

In many countries (if this is one job) this would be illegal as it's dangerous.

You rely on your family for help with the kids (where is he in this and where are his family). \n\nWhy did you need to take your children to your mother's house on NYE? Why couldn't they stay at home? He knew he had to take care of his own children, yet was too hungover to do so. That's grossly irresponsible. \n\nMy comment is quite long but I was really struck by your post about the whole situation you are in.
