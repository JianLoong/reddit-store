My husband (30sM) and I have been together for a over a decade, and I chose to keep my maiden name when we got married several years ago. He has always respected this decision. As far as future children go, I always knew our children having his surname was important to him, and I never had an issue with this. \n\nSo now I am pregnant, and after we found out I was excited. In my excitement & babbling about the future, I mentioned the idea of a hyphenated name, which I immediately said wouldn\u2019t be practical, as it would be a too much of a mouthful. I reiterated that his last name for the baby was the plan. He balked, disgusted at the idea of hyphenated names, and said \u201ckids with hyphenated names get picked on, and they\u2019re ridiculous. The baby will have my name because that\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d Again, the baby having his last name I was in support of, but I was taken aback by this comment, and asked \u201cwhat do you mean \u2018that\u2019s the way it is\u2019?\u201d He went off saying how children automatically are given their father\u2019s last names at birth- as if it\u2019s some sort of automatic legal requirement- like someone comes to hospital & enforces the father\u2019s last name on the birth certificate? Now I am even more taken aback, and questioning wtf is he talking about??? I am not liking this. He escalated further about men who has children without their last names are schmucks, pussies, etc.. I am fully stunned at this point. He has no explanation for the statement he made about fathers names being automatically enforced by nameless, faceless entities on families at hospitals, and switched to saying \u201cc\u2019mon you know this has always been important to me\u201d which I feel is contradictory to the bizarre claim of legal enforcement. \n\nI went from having no issue with giving our child his surname, to having an issue with it, as I am upset with what I perceive to be entitlement. And even though I don\u2019t want a hyphenated name I was still upset about him being so disgusted with the idea of my surname being included. This conversation changed the whole tone of this  for me- it went from being something I had no problem doing because I knew it was important to him, to being very turned off by his recently discovered beliefs. I have addressed it twice since this originally occurred, telling him it\u2019s very off putting & upsetting for me. He just blows up & demands to know what last name the baby will have. I know I am hormonal, and not quite myself lately, so I would like to know other peoples take? AITA for having such an issue with this?\n\n\n** for clarity: I feel like I may be the AH because I may be overreacting and/or irrational, like I am causing unnecessary issues.\n\n\n****EDIT*** there was never an explicit agreement between my husband and I of what to name hypothetical future children. I know it is something important to him, but it was never an agreement in our relationship, prior to, or after marriage. This was the first time we ever discussed surnames in any serious capacity. This was the first time hyphenation was ever addressed. He has never stated future children must carry his surname exclusively until this conversation. He obviously knows how important my surname is to me, being as I kept it. We have an older child from a previous relationship- none of us share last names. I also don\u2019t believe me keeping my maiden name or our older child having a different name makes us any less of a family.", "created_utc": 1700159992, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17wu3q8/aita_for_having_an_issue_with_my_spouses_stance/", "score": 1830, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When we had a child, I had not problem with the child having my partner's  last name.  My reasoning was similar to yours.

It's one thing to make a decision between the two of you (though honestly the \"difficulties\" of hyphenated last names are largely overblown by people who just don't want to hyphenate.) It's another thing to be asked to sign off on patriarchal nonsense, and it's worth asking what else he's going to insist on because in his mind it's \"just how things are.\" The fact that he's repeatedly blowing up about it rather than taking a step back to talk calmly about his views, and expects you to roll with that, is more than cause to be upset. NTA.\n\nNot gonna tell you to leave him, Reddit-style, but do keep an eye on this stuff. If he's taking his cues from unexamined gender stereotypes, you may see some parenting behavior that is potentially problematic, even if you find him a mostly-reasonable partner.", "NTA at all... even if you had changed your mind and considered hyphenating... still NTA. \n\n>The baby will have my name because that\u2019s just the way it is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He escalated further about men who has children without their last names are schmucks, pussies, etc.\n\nAre these really the first controlling, sexist comments he's made in over a decade?

He\u2019s the asshole for blowing up repeatedly over this and bullying \n you instead of talking through it like adults. \n\nI\u2019d have a huge problem with not hyphenating based off of how he\u2019s reacting. It\u2019s the principle of the thing. But with how emasculated he thinks that would make him, it could be relationship ending if that is what you decided.

But making it clear that it\u2019s his behaviour that\u2019s the problem, not the name debate, I think will get you further. \n\nI\u2019ve had my husband blow his top over patriarchal bullshit that he just didn\u2019t want to look critically at. Like when I said I was going back to work recently and he was like well who\u2019s going to be home for the kids? And I explained that he may actually have to contribute to sick day care and such now. He made some snide remark about throwing away my privilege and I had to call him out on throwing a tantrum over equalizing parenting duties. It embarrassed him, and after he calmed down and was able to think more critically he admitted that he just hadn\u2019t thought critically about it and that his comment was out of pocket. \n\nJust goes to show that toxic masculinity is so insidious and it can be really jarring for men who consider themselves \u201cgood\u201d when they realize that they are in fact reinforcing it.", "NTA  \n\n\nThat you are pregnant, hormonal, moods, what ever, has nothing to do with anything.

I kept my name after marriage, and when my children were born, they were automatically called \"baby mylastname,\" so the idea that your baby is magically going to be given his by the government/hospital is just not true. \nBeyond that, it is a really ridiculous and pretty misogynistic take that he has about last names, and I definitely think you're NTA. Feeling entitled to his many being their ONLY name without a conversation is a bit overzealous, in my opinion, but then his opinion on hyphenated names and children without their father's names is frankly awful. \nI wish you the best and hope that you two can have actual productive conversations about this and that this can be worked through.

I have been married to my husband for 14 years and we have two daughters ages 10 and 12. I thought I was going to change my name and then said, no I won't. Hubby was on board the whole time (still is or else we would not still be married after 14 years). \nWhen the girls were born, because I was the original patient and their mom and the baby came out of me both daughters were listed in the hospital as Baby \"my last name\".

So I'm there lurking.

When school time comes I would just let them know that the legal name is hyphenated but parents chose to just use the one. This way the child has the option when older to choose which name to go by if wanted or both. Just my 2 cents.", "Doesn\u2019t anyone discuss this stuff beforehand. Seriously.", "YTA solely for baiting his reaction. \nYOU created a problem when there literally wasn\u2019t one. \n\nYou knew how strongly he felt and how important it was for his child to have his last name. \nYou already agreed with giving your child hubbys last name. Why even bring up the hyphenated name. Now you\u2019re all offended over something that you already knew and you agreed with lol. \n\nSeems like you crave drama. \n\nNow his response was extreme but I bet you were banking on it.", "As I see it, you have two problems. The first is the practical one of what last name the baby will have. The second is the discovery that the baby having your husband's last name was important to him for reasons that you find repugnant, now that they are articulated.\n\nYou are NTA, imo. But you still do have both problems.\n\nThe first problem has a third possible solution that might be a middle way: Your last name could be the baby's middle name. There is traditional precedent for that. My father (b. 1932) was given his mother's (b. 1900) last name as his middle name, something that I've found not uncommon in older generations. The names weren't hyphenated--his official last name was that of his father. But his mother's last name was also part of his legal name.\n\nThe second problem will take some working through over time, but you'll have a better shot at a reasoned conversation if you're able to separate the reasons for his preference from the actual naming of this baby. That would take some of the pressure and emotion out of the discussion and give him some breathing room to think through where his own strong feelings come from.", "As a mother that gave our son my last name;  YTA. You knew it was important to him. You want to discuss it now? You should have had a conversation before. If you give your baby your last name expect to raise it alone. This is so weird.

This is why many women retain their maiden name by either using it as an additional middle name, or hyphenating. Spanish surnames often incorporate both parents\u2019 names. \n\nRealistically, most children who do not have their father\u2019s last name, were born out of wedlock. Though the stigma has lessened, it would be accurate to say that the parents were not committed enough to get married. Once the assumption is made that a child is born out of wedlock, people would then wonder if the father was present, or absentee. \n\nYour husband feels fiercely protective of his child. He\u2019s basically saying, MINE! Puffing his chest out. See! That\u2019s my boy or my girl. This tradition is based on centuries of committing to a family. On the flip side, there are eons of history of men airing children out of wedlock, leaving pregnant women as impoverished social pariahs, refusing to grant the child the claim and protection of his kin, and then the totally unfair condemnation by society of children born out of wedlock forever being branded as symbolic of their parents\u2019 lack of responsibility. Even today, the word \u201cb@stard\u201d is still an insult. Given that history, I understand why you would object to his denigration of not passing on the name. He feels this is about respect. If you deny him giving his last name, to him it will mean you do not respect him, and the world might not respect his child. It\u2019s his belief, so you can\u2019t change it. \n\nBeing denied passing his name on to his child is clearly devastating, yet here you are, considering it. \n\nWould you like your feelings to be considered one day?\n\nYou and your husband are two very different people. You are going to have divergent opinions and beliefs. You can either respect that the man you love, the father of your child, has a traditional belief in a father passing on his name, claiming kinship, or you can\u2019t.\n\nSo, what are you going to do? Divorce him for his old fashioned beliefs on surnames? Deny him giving his surname and then live with a hurt and resentful man until things peter out? Allow him to give his surname but resent it?

So I ended up giving her my last name and he predictably flipped, said the same things your husband has, basically. I hate that mindset, hate the entitlement. He tried at various times as she was growing up to change her name, tried to talk her into wanting her name changed, would sign her up for things with his last name, etc. She is now 18 years old and the whole ordeal has annoyed her so much that she doesn't even want to change her name when she gets married either.

How do you spell it?\" Annoying, lol.\n\nAnyways, looks like OPs husband is really insecure about the fact that OP doesn't have his surname.

Short legal documents, they tend to go by the last name of that hyphenation and pretty much treat the first half as a middle name. \n\nWhile it's clearly going to be a difficult thing to do, I would continue to try to talk about this with him. At this point, the conversation would have to open with something like \"I absolutely do not want to fight about this. However, we really need to have a conversation about this. We need to be adults and have a calm but open and honest conversation. I know how important it is for our child to carry your surname, and I have never been against that, and really, I still am NOT against it. This has become a bigger issue than what name our child will have. I am hurt, upset, and put off by how this has gone down. I am really upset by the person I am seeing in this situation. For that reason, I can't and won't let it go. But I can't and will not argue about it either. Yes, I am demanding a conversation about it. Yes, I am demanding a calm, collected, and adult conversation about it. This is the only heads up I will give, I will stop talking and walk away if you start getting upset and yelling at me over it. Please, sit down and discuss this with me.\" \n\nAfter that, my first question would be, \"I have always said and agreed that our children would carry your last name because I know how important it is to you. You're important to me, so it was never a second thought that our child(ren) would have your surname. I do not understand the anger you have shown towards me over this. Why have you shown anger towards me over this? Why are you ac5ing like I have been arguing with you and saying that our child(ren) canot and will not have your name? What can I do or say so that we can have this calm conversation without you feeling like I am coming down on you, disrespecting you or otherwise making you feel like I don't value you opinions wants and needs on this topic?\" And go from there.\n\nThe absolute instant he gets upset, I would give one chance, \"we do not need to argue over this. Please talk with me because fighting isn't going to get us anywhere.\" If he doesn't calm down, or at least acknowledge he is upset and will do his best to keep the emotions down, I would stop talking and walk away. The only other thing I would say would be, \"I understand this upsets you even if I do not understand why. I am trying to understand that, but I can't until we can have a calm conversation. Please let me know when we are able to talk WITH each other.\" \n\nI have actually used this tactic with my husband. He even started to do it with me. We are both emotionally driven people and didn't always have the control we have learned to have on them. While neither of us has to go this route too often, it still occasionally happens. I say something similar to the above. I let him know I will not be speaking with him (and I make sure to use with instead of to because I don't want to speak to him, I want to speak with him) until he can talk with me without yelling. I won't be speaking with him until he can listen to what I have to say and express what he needs to express in a way that I am actually able to hear him. And I stick to it. He can yell and scream and even follow me all he wants. I don't react. Except for the initial statement, I don't engage. I don't tell him to stop or calm down. I don't yell back. I ignore him, I act like he is not in the room until he is able to calm down. The instant he does, even if I can still hear the anger and frustration in his voice, I start engaging again. And I repeat as necessary. It's not easy to do. It has taken some time. I also try to stay calm even when he isn't. I give it a minute or to by responding and talking to him like he's not upset and yelling.\n\nHang in there, OP. Something is clearly triggering him about this, and his reaction is definitely not ok. Do your best to put the effort in to keep working at finding out what the problem is. Just do so on the level.you want, not what he is trying to create. Eventually, his subconscious will smack him, and even if he is still angry over it, he will start talking in a calmer and less angry way. You're showing him you love him, support him, and want to hear and address what is upsetting him by not engaging in the emotional level. You should be able to work through this. If it doesn't change, going to a counselor or mediator just to help you talk through this issue can help. It's the point of having a third party. Someone who is not involved helps translate as well as be the voice of calm down. Another good thing to ask would be something like, \"What can I do for you so that we are able to have a conversation about this without you feeling like I am attacking you?\" It should let him know that you are not ok with his emotional level but also want to dp what you can so that he knows you are really hearing what he is saying and taking his feelings on it seriously.", "It\u2019s not toxic.
