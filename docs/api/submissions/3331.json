We\u2019ll call her Ava.\n\nAva and I used to be pretty friendly, but I\u2019ve distanced myself the last couple of years because of a series of instances where she has behaved childishly and petty toward me. I don\u2019t want to foster a friendship with someone whose company I don\u2019t particularly enjoy. That said, It\u2019s important to me to keep the peace at work and not make more waves than necessary.\n\nI am determined to be a good Secret Santa, and have purchased a gift for each member of Ava\u2019s family (all animals) that I plan to gift separately over the coming weeks. \n\nLast week, I left the first present in her cubicle, which was a thoughtful gift for one of her pets. I have experience with this particular type of animal (not a normal house pet) and put thought into this gift, and really thought it would be appreciated. I would buy it for my own animal. She posted a picture and a thank you to our internal group chat, and I didn\u2019t think any more of it. \n\nToday, Ava approached me and asked if I had received a Secret Santa gift and I told her I had and was gracious about it. She used this as an opening to start bashing the gift she had received from her Secret Santa (me). She felt comfortable doing this, despite the fact that we are a small department and there was only a few people it could be, because I \u201cwould know better than to get her something like this.\u201d Ava criticized the plastic packaging the gift came in, insinuated that it was old/expired, even though this item doesn\u2019t actually expire, and had texted a mutual friend of ours to make fun of it/ turn it into an inside joke. Again, this a grown woman acting like a Mean Girl.  \n\nI went along with it, and at no point did I reveal I\u2019m her Secret Santa. I did politely question a few of the points she was trying to make because her logic was weak, at best. \n\nI still plan to give her the remaining gifts and assume at some point that she will put 2+2 together and realize I\u2019m her Secret Santa. I\u2019m planning on wrapping her remaining gifts in the same paper I am giving a small gift to the rest of the office in. We don\u2019t have a time where we get together and reveal it- it\u2019s up to the gift giver to decide if they want to reveal themselves. I think the wrapping paper will give it away if she doesn\u2019t figure it out first, and honestly I\u2019m fine with that. Looking forward to it, even. \n\nI\u2019m feeling a little hurt, but mostly just amused and a little spiteful. I am also anticipating her to find fault with the other gifts for petty reasons (dog toy won\u2019t be \u201cone she likes\u201d or cat treat won\u2019t \u201cbe organic enough\u201d).

We only have your word that it is not old/expired like she mentioned. It might just be a case of having different perspectives on presents. I would also bash a gift that was expired tbh.\n\nWorkplace Secret Santa is usually going to be tagged to a price value. Are you putting in too much thought to it and overcomplicating things?

If Ava is going to be \u201cextremely embarrassed\u201d when she realizes you\u2019re her secret Santa, is that going to affect your working relationship? Again, you said you have a small team and it\u2019s important to you to keep the peace at work \u2013 allowing her to embarrass herself like that isn\u2019t conducive to either of those things.", "NTA.

Fact is I enjoy gifting and I\u2019m good at it, so it\u2019s for me as much as for her. We all like doing stuff we\u2019re good at. And some people do choose to do a few small gifts as opposed to one larger one, so I  decided to follow suit.", "I enjoy doing Secret Santa and I like getting people stuff they would like. Honestly, it was probably more for me than her in that sense. Maybe I was doing more to make sure I wasn\u2019t giving her less than someone who I liked better.

I also think some comments are equating \u201cthoughtful\u201d to \u201cexpensive.\u201d This was not an expensive gift\u2026 I do suspect part of the reason she\u2019s mad are because she thinks it\u2019s the only thing she\u2019s getting and she\u2019s pissed it wasn\u2019t for her.", "I love this idea.", "She may not have appreciated it, but I'm a bit ridiculous about my dog (and everyone knows this) and would be totally delighted to get dog toys in a secret santa exchange.
