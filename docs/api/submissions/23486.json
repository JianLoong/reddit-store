Labeling it as such usually will result in the exact reaction you received. She was clearly seeking some type of reassurance from you that she is beautiful - would that have been so hard to say? Mildly, YTA. It seems your gf is insecure about her body and while that may not make sense to you because you're perfectly content with her body, it's a source of worry for her. I don't disagree with your statement to her that you wish she'd be kinder to herself, but I think a heartfelt compliment would have gone a long way in that situation.", "YTA.  Would it have killed you to hug her and reassure her she looked great?", "I get what you were trying to do, but that was not the best way to go about doing it.\n\nI don't think you're an AH exactly, I just think you need to work on your communication skills.", "You didn\u2019t validate her. You dismissed her and insulted her. I know you didn\u2019t want to hurt her but you did. So you\u2019re not an asshole per se, but you are being insensitive", "You need to choose your words more carefully mate\n\nYTA", "Teaching someone to be kinder to oneself by actually insulting them further? Way to go bro.\n\nYTA", "YTA: You absolutely invalidated her and you owe her a massive, massive apology. The only correct response to her concern is to reassure her that she looks beautiful and to then try to distract her by changing  the topic or going to do something fun. \n\nIf concerns about her body image come up on a regular basis, it may be appropriate (in a private and safe setting, not while on vacation) to gently encourage her to get mental health support from a professional. It sounds like she has some pretty extreme body image issues and she might need a mental health intervention.\n\nMaybe after you apologize, you can say something like, \"I'm really concerned about you. It seems like you're really unhappy with your body. Have you ever considered talking with someone who might be able to help you? I just want you to know that I think your body is perfect and healthy looking, and it really concerns me when you put yourself down so often\".", "YTA she needed reassurance, not you pointing out more flaws. \n\nIf your intention was to get her to be kinder to herself, maybe say that next time, because the rest of us don't see how \"overdramatic\" and \"you deserve more kindness\" are interchangable.", "YTA - your girlfriend's response was proportional to the society that has her trained to believe that 100% of her value is tied up in her weight and size.\n\nYour reaction was unkind, and more importantly incredibly unhelpful!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

YTA.", "She\u2019s 25. She was young during heroin chic years and a teenager during the low rise, thin-is-in era. The experience of young women who grew up in that atmosphere is to police their bodies, scrutinise the way they look and to a greater or lesser extent place their worth in their physical appearance. It\u2019s unhealthy and very painful for her. The reason it comes across as overdramatic is because to you, it\u2019s a cute pic. To her, it\u2019s really genuinely triggering a spiral. Your girlfriend may need to work on her self image and deconstruct some of that programming. But in future, I can guarantee you\u2019ll have a better relationship if you hear her out, and then calmly tell her that she\u2019s beautiful and you love her body exactly how it is now. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole, I think this is just something you haven\u2019t experienced and you put your foot in it.
