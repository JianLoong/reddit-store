Labeling it as such usually will result in the exact reaction you received. She was clearly seeking some type of reassurance from you that she is beautiful - would that have been so hard to say? Mildly, YTA. It seems your gf is insecure about her body and while that may not make sense to you because you're perfectly content with her body, it's a source of worry for her. I don't disagree with your statement to her that you wish she'd be kinder to herself, but I think a heartfelt compliment would have gone a long way in that situation.", "YTA.  Would it have killed you to hug her and reassure her she looked great?", "I get what you were trying to do, but that was not the best way to go about doing it.\n\nI don't think you're an AH exactly, I just think you need to work on your communication skills.", "You didn\u2019t validate her. You dismissed her and insulted her. I know you didn\u2019t want to hurt her but you did. So you\u2019re not an asshole per se, but you are being insensitive", "You need to choose your words more carefully mate\n\nYTA", "Teaching someone to be kinder to oneself by actually insulting them further? Way to go bro.\n\nYTA", "YTA: You absolutely invalidated her and you owe her a massive, massive apology. The only correct response to her concern is to reassure her that she looks beautiful and to then try to distract her by changing  the topic or going to do something fun. \n\nIf concerns about her body image come up on a regular basis, it may be appropriate (in a private and safe setting, not while on vacation) to gently encourage her to get mental health support from a professional. It sounds like she has some pretty extreme body image issues and she might need a mental health intervention.\n\nMaybe after you apologize, you can say something like, \"I'm really concerned about you. It seems like you're really unhappy with your body. Have you ever considered talking with someone who might be able to help you? I just want you to know that I think your body is perfect and healthy looking, and it really concerns me when you put yourself down so often\".", "YTA she needed reassurance, not you pointing out more flaws. \n\nIf your intention was to get her to be kinder to herself, maybe say that next time, because the rest of us don't see how \"overdramatic\" and \"you deserve more kindness\" are interchangable.", "YTA - your girlfriend's response was proportional to the society that has her trained to believe that 100% of her value is tied up in her weight and size.\n\nYour reaction was unkind, and more importantly incredibly unhelpful!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You both deserve better and at the same time, you deserve each other. She needs serious help and you need to learn to keep your mouth shut in front of insanity. ESH", "YTA. Insulting her and diminishing her feelings while she\u2019s already feeling very insecure won\u2019t make her feel better", "Calling someone over dramatic isn\u2019t kind it\u2019s condescending. YTA.", "She\u2019s 25. She was young during heroin chic years and a teenager during the low rise, thin-is-in era. The experience of young women who grew up in that atmosphere is to police their bodies, scrutinise the way they look and to a greater or lesser extent place their worth in their physical appearance. It\u2019s unhealthy and very painful for her. The reason it comes across as overdramatic is because to you, it\u2019s a cute pic. To her, it\u2019s really genuinely triggering a spiral. Your girlfriend may need to work on her self image and deconstruct some of that programming. But in future, I can guarantee you\u2019ll have a better relationship if you hear her out, and then calmly tell her that she\u2019s beautiful and you love her body exactly how it is now. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole, I think this is just something you haven\u2019t experienced and you put your foot in it. NAH.", "calling someone dramatic is invalidating, gaslighting, etc. there's definitely different ways to approach this imo.", "I tried that later, didn't work", "thats fair", "The operative word being later.   As in too late.  AH.", "Well yeah, it's too late now. That's what you should have done first \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "NTA. Some self acceptance wouldn't hurt her. And if she really is so upset about a few pounds, then do something about it. You didnt call her fat, you didnt do anything wrong", "NTA and she sounds like a drama queen.  Next time, ask yourself if you'd rather be right or happy before saying something like that.", "YTA\nwhy couldn't you have assured her that her big(ger) butt is what makes her sexy? *Don't* you actually love her big butt? My husband frequently compliments me on mine and it's bigger (and my hips are broader) than average too and that's exactly what he loves. \nI see in your comments that you say you did it \"later\". What's the point of that *after* you callously call her overdramatic?", "YTA for not just reassuring her.\n\nSome commenters here are dunces for using the wrong words and arguing that we should validate people's insecurities. That would mean we feed the insecurity and make the insecure person think their self-critiques are valid.\n\nJust think about the words you use, everyone.", "YTA. \u201cYou\u2019re being over dramatic\u201d is a wonderful way to say \u201cplease turn up on me\u201d.", "YTA , saying that after days of complaining would be unacceptable. But it was only 10 mins of her being upset.", "My man, I totally get where you're coming from but you have to understand women a little bit better in this situation..", "YTA insecurities aren't rational. All you can do is reassure them", "Get a new girl friend. This one's too whiny!", "I can't decide between NAH and ESH. Because in the big picture, your GF is being an AH to herself. But in that moment, you chose the wrong words to reassure her that you found her attractive.", "NTA, because your intentions were pure and this is a very slippery slope, so it\u2019s very difficult to get it right the first time and you\u2019re here to learn. I do get why she felt hurt and thought you were and asshole, but I think she will understand what you were trying to convey once her emotions have settled. \n\nSpeaking for myself: If I compare myself to others and there is a clear difference between me and them (I have very narrow hips, which is my insecurity) it doesn\u2019t help when my bf pretends I\u2019m seeing things that aren\u2019t there, because they clearly are. Also, telling me I\u2019m overdramatic would make me feel like my feelings/insecurities aren\u2019t valid. \n\nI would rather hear something along the lines of \u2018Yes, you have straight figure, but that\u2019s what I love about your body. In no way does it negatively influence your level of attractiveness\u2019. \n\nBut not all women are the same, so I\u2019m expecting some comments from fellow-ladies who would appreciate a different approach. \n\nMy two cents: Apologize to her for not validating her feelings, tell her you think she has a banging body and that it hurts you to see her second guessing herself and that you wish she could look at herself through your eyes, because she deserves to be proud of her butt.", "NTA but you could have been kinder with your words. You could have just told her that you find her attractive the way she is. Yes she was a little dramatic but you were also a little insensitive. Just work on your communication.", "NAH-\nShe isn\u2019t at fault for being insecure, it happens! I also don\u2019t blame you right now because I think your overall message was in good faith, but phrased horribly. \n\nId talk to her again and apologize for calling her over dramatic but clarify that your point about her needing to be kinder to herself still stands.\n\nI honestly wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she\u2019s still standoffish around you though. I personally wouldn\u2019t want to be vulnerable with someone who called me over dramatic, so it might take time for her to trust you again in that aspect.", "Remember: Never in the history of the world has someone been calmed down by someone saying \u201cjust calm down\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re being over-sensitive\u201d. It\u2019s not like the damaging effects of body issues are a secret. This was a situation to reassure and redirect if possible. But also, you might have been trying to offer a solution when what she wanted was to be listened to. So soft YTA because if that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s a very common mistake.", "Your approach was super logical but logic is not called for in those types of situations.   Women are super sensitive about their weight so you have to adapt your approach to the audience.", "You want people to validate your insecurities?\n\nThink you got too bogged down in the jargon and ended up saying something you don't mean.", "I never said that, just that he couldve communicated better", "Come on people, I\u2019m a female and I agree that she was being overdramatic. Women need to be able to receive messages just as we want men to be able to deliver the narrative to reflect how we feel, think, speak, etc. We need to stop trying to control what men say when they\u2019re trying to be supportive.", "Aren\u2019t we still in the era of big butts being beautiful?! I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. All bodies are different in some form. NTA.", "NTA. Yeah, you could have handled it better, but it is unfair and socially tone deaf to go on and on about your own physique, positively or negatively. If she\u2019s unhappy with her butt, she can take steps to change it or learn to live with or stay unhappy with it, but there is no need to subject others to her pity party of self-hate. She was an attention-seeking drama llama and you didn\u2019t dispense the compliments she was whinily demanding.", "NTA, she sounds psychotic. I'd get the fuck out of there asap.", "Your intentions were probably good, but what you failed to realize is it was a no win scenario. You wanted to tell her she's not really fat, but she took it as you not taking her seriously. If you would have just agreed with her, she'd probably think you were calling her fat. It's what they call a Catch 22.", "NAH. The \u201cblubberbutt\u201d nickname was a bit *much* so there is kind of an argument for her being slightly \u201cover-dramatic\u201d, but that\u2019s besides the point. You just wanted to let her know that the idea of her being fat is ridiculous and that she\u2019s not. Sure the \u201cover-dramatic\u201d comment could\u2019ve been excluded but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call an AH for it since you meant well. Just communicate what you mean better next time.", "YTA. Wow. You sound supportive and full of empathy. /s", "Your insecurities aren\u2019t a problem for someone else to solve. Nobody wants to hear every negative thought you have.", "No, women aren\u2019t any particular way. We are each individuals. Many of us don\u2019t need to be verbally pandered to or lied to.", "True, but if this is not a common occurrence you can certainly support them."]}
