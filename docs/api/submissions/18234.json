Im the second daughter to get married and she gave her wedding dress (that I wanted to wear) to my sister in law without even asking me first.

The biggest problem they are having is selecting one because truly there are so many options.

It is NOT a big ask.\n\nIt's ok to want to stand out *on your wedding day*.  You are the bride.  You can tell her no and tell her to pick a different dress/color.

Champagne is a very light color but not near white/eggshell/ivory . We need to draw the line somewhere, and white is off limit to many brides( I don't really mind , to me, the person wearing white is making a fool of herself). So go ahead and wear white at my wedding, you will be looking like a fool, not me lol\n\nI don't know your age, but there's no way your mom could pass for the bride , even if she wore ivory or white. It is a bit insensitive of her, but try to let it go.  It's probably a nice color to her and wants to feel pretty. I don't see it as she is trying to hurt you. Don't make it the hill you'll die on. \n\nCongrats, and enjoy that special day.\n\nETA :  After looking at the color, it is much darker than champagne!

It's giving wedding guest dress, not bridal. It's closer to beige/brown than white.

Would splashing out on a gorgeous veil, or a tiara/headpiece, jewellery or a new dress make you feel stunning enough in your own light? Or is the problem internal?

Not at all everyone ofc, but women with a white shirt, dress white-ish with big blue flowers and so on. No one bat an eye. But it was not in church, and first bride was not in dress (and not in white), second was in dress but more grey than white. So maybe that's it, or maybe it's a cultural thing i don't know. I had the same conversation several times with colleagues or friends and everyone were on the same page (why the f does it matter). But again, not in church and not in America so i don't know. Hey, as long as the couple is strong that's the most important ;)", "While a valid option\u2026 I just feel like that\u2019s too petty, I think if I let it go and she wears the dress then it should be fully let go at that point - I don\u2019t want to be passive about it", "Monkey see, monky do. Don't intend to be harsh but it's probably just a cultural thing. The posts here with dramas over wedding etiquette or graduation etiquette seems to be all american. But of course every country has specificities and \"forbidden\" things like that, some things i consider rude as hell would be totally normal elsewhere ehehe", "I hope this is the case! I won\u2019t see it until the day of the wedding as we live on opposite coasts", "I don\u2019t want the wedding. I want to elope. The wedding is for everyone else. So the fact this is my one ask\u2026 it feels small in comparison. I got guilted into having a wedding I don\u2019t want to have and guess who\u2019s paying for it? Me and my FH. So yeah; I don\u2019t want to have it anyways but if I cancel it I\u2019ll effectively be disowned", "It's interesting you would be so adamant about a thing you clearly don't really understand.", "Yeah the over the top stuff like what people where and that are a very American thing. We like to spend money and stress out about \u201cthe happiest day of your life\u201d \ud83d\ude44 Maybe OP is just jealous her mom can pull off that dress at her age lol.", "And it's interesting that you're so condescending and butthurt about an opinion different than yours. I do understand, i just share my opinion, that's it.", "I\u2019m not American but thank you. It\u2019s traditional in my culture to wear red\u2026 not white. But thank you for your input. My FH is American", "Ahah yeah maybe ! But well when you grow up in a certain society where you are hammered with same ideas about wedding (must be like this, like that, if not omg), there is social expectation and you are programmed to do so, even if it's not your type at first. It's not hurting anyone though, but it seems so stressfull for the couple... An extra small city hall ceremony, keep all the money and bam, you got the craziest and longest honeymoon instead !", "Just cruise through life as you please, I guess. Good luck with that.", "Interesting ! I heard about orange for wedding but never red. And in your culture, is it similar, as it's rude and inappropriate to wear red if you're a guest ?", "I wanted to elope. My family disagreed. So here we are having a wedding.", "I'll do, wearing white of course ahah", "Yes it is. The bride is to be the only one in that color. It\u2019s a tradition since the day you wear something like that is specific to that day", "Yep the pressure from family can be like that. I hope it won't spoil your fun and your day though ! It must be so stressfull to organize in the first place, even worse when things get a little messy. Courage and good luck !", "Thank you for your kind words!"]}
