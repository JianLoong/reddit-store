Im the second daughter to get married and she gave her wedding dress (that I wanted to wear) to my sister in law without even asking me first.

The biggest problem they are having is selecting one because truly there are so many options.

It is NOT a big ask.\n\nIt's ok to want to stand out *on your wedding day*.  You are the bride.  You can tell her no and tell her to pick a different dress/color.

So go ahead and wear white at my wedding, you will be looking like a fool, not me lol\n\nI don't know your age, but there's no way your mom could pass for the bride , even if she wore ivory or white. It is a bit insensitive of her, but try to let it go.  It's probably a nice color to her and wants to feel pretty. I don't see it as she is trying to hurt you. Don't make it the hill you'll die on. \n\nCongrats, and enjoy that special day.\n\nETA :  After looking at the color, it is much darker than champagne!

Don't intend to be harsh but it's probably just a cultural thing. The posts here with dramas over wedding etiquette or graduation etiquette seems to be all american.

My FH is American", "Ahah yeah maybe ! But well when you grow up in a certain society where you are hammered with same ideas about wedding (must be like this, like that, if not omg), there is social expectation and you are programmed to do so, even if it's not your type at first. It's not hurting anyone though, but it seems so stressfull for the couple... An extra small city hall ceremony, keep all the money and bam, you got the craziest and longest honeymoon instead !", "Just cruise through life as you please, I guess. Good luck with that.", "Interesting ! I heard about orange for wedding but never red. And in your culture, is it similar, as it's rude and inappropriate to wear red if you're a guest ?", "I wanted to elope. My family disagreed. So here we are having a wedding.", "I'll do, wearing white of course ahah", "Yes it is. The bride is to be the only one in that color. It\u2019s a tradition since the day you wear something like that is specific to that day", "Yep the pressure from family can be like that. I hope it won't spoil your fun and your day though ! It must be so stressfull to organize in the first place, even worse when things get a little messy. Courage and good luck !", "Thank you for your kind words!", "NTA, and turnabout is fair play right? \"It's a beautiful dress, mom, but are you ok with how much it washes you out?\"", "Hey OP, would you like me to bring the red wine?", "NTA\n\nI wore a champagne dress that looked white, not light gold, in pictures, my photographer asked if I wanted them edited to show the champagne color better. Maybe you can have your photographer edit your pictures?\n\nYour mom's dress is way too bridal, by the way. You're not crazy or selfish or anything like that.", "It is a pretty dress and it looks way too much like a wedding dress. Maybe not a more traditional floofy dress with lace and stuff but definitely enough to cause confusion/be an attempt to steal the show.\n\n\nNTA.

To me this situation depends on the relationship between you two and from your edit it sounds like this is a case of your mother disregarding your feelings and wanting to upstage.\n\nMy mum actually wore a knee-length champagne dress to my wedding, but it never occurred to me that there was even a hint of wanting to upstage me because we have a good relationship. It's pretty obvious who's the bride on the day, and it'll be obvious it's you, but from the sound of it you're right to be bothered. Tbh the easiest thing for the day may be to try and let it go because nobody's eyes will be on her anyway, so any ill intentions of hers will be wasted.

I will ask, did you try and suggest a colour to her? Like navy blue or something", "She treats you like shit and has no regard for your feelings\u2026 why is she even invited to your wedding?", "NTA. Do what another bride did. Have her bridesmaid where champagne and get a new dress. Totally different color. She went black and purple, obviously not for everyone.  But you get the idea. Add some beautiful, colorful imbellishments to your current dress.  So many great ways to come out ahead and still love what you have.\n\nShe'll blend into the background and you'll stand out as it should be.

If so here's what you do, have a really good friend (guy or girl doesn't matter), get a really big red solo cup of red wine (or kool-aid or something equally staining), they will accidently trip or run into your mom just before pictures or the wedding begins. This way she will either look ridiculous or have to change. Make sure you have another guest that just happens to have an appropriate dress for her to change into (say an aunt of similar size or friend as a guest) to step forward and offer the dress, they can say they weren't sure which dress/outift they were going to wear so they brought both or that they are attending another affair tomorrow and just happened to have the outfit in their car.", "NTA.\n\nWhen did mother's get so unsupportive. It's fantastic helping someone organise something like this and taking joy in seeing them happy. I can't wait to dress shop with my girls (if that's what they want) and I would be more than happy to coordinate my outfit to fit their theme and ask them if they had anything in particular in mind they would want me to wear. Heck if they said please dress as Queen Elsa you bet I'm buying a side braided wig. Point is this day is about you and her dress choice is obnoxious and self-centred.

You don't have to say it with emotion in your voice or any sort of bad intent. You just.. say it. And let her respond. Now that I'm an adult, I've found that every once in a while I have to tell my parents how they make me feel--because every so often they make me feel small, and I'm not a kid now. They just need to be reminded! The situation with your mom sounds different, but still.. people like that are usually sorta wimpy when you come at them without drama.

It's cool if you don't understand cultural/ religious traditions, but you don't make your stand at the fucking ceremony. Would you wear anything but black at a funeral? No, in case you need to know. Is someone going to confuse you with the fucking corpse if you don't? Unlikely, but it's a known tradition. When explicitly asked not to wear a certain color to a ceremony, you don't do it. Who cares why? You're not going to burst into flames if you refrain from certain colors for a day.", "They don't.  They're both individually choosing what color they want to wear, and they're both individually choosing between navy and dark silver with no prompting from us.  Which like I said, is not particularly surprising because those are two of the most popular colors for mother of the bride/groom dresses.  That's why I've seen so many dresses: they're both sending me dresses they like in those colors.  \n\nIt's not particularly uncommon where I am from to have both mothers in matching colors though.  The bride/grooms' families often choose to dress in the wedding colors as a way to set themselves apart as the immediate family of the couple, and it's not uncommon to pick a color for the \"mothers\" to wear too.  I'm not doing it personally, but so long as you don't pick a wacky color, people are fine with it and sort of enjoy it because it can be a way to honor the mothers and make them stand out from the crowd of guests.  I think my mom would have preferred that, honestly, because it is kind of a way of including them in the bridal party, but I have too much on my plate to add even one more dress to the mix.", "Your only doing this so you can challenge your friends friendship level?

I fully agree on the part that the mom is a pain and should suck it up, i was just wondering about all the drama around a color. I don't know if it makes sense lol, english is hard for me so i could as an asshole.
