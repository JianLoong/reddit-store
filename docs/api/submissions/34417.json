Your aunt is making your mother's situation all about herself.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. You are literally protecting your mother. \n\nNTA.", "ABSOLUTELY NTA.

In no way does that include bringing a total stranger and either the stranger or your aunt getting so mad that they act like toddlers who missed an afternoon nap.", "Your aunt didn't need emotional support while in the hospital room with your mother. Her boyfriend could have stayed at the hospital in the waiting room to provide any comfort she needed if he was really there to provide support for her.
