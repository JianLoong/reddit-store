Because so many of my family members currently have health issues, we took the task on ourselves, asking for little to no help. We were exhausted, but happy to do it. \n\nWith all of that said, many people took home \u201cto go\u201d plates yesterday, which did not leave us much for leftovers. Still\u2026 A-OK. Very happy with this and feeling blessed that everyone had a good time and left with full bellies. \n\nSo tell me.. when family comes back over the next day to get more food (and this was fine and expected) but invites even MORE people to get leftovers, which would mean nothing left for me and my kids.. Am I the a-hole for saying no more? Because apparently I am for setting boundaries and wanting, idk more than one meal out of the meal we purchased and cooked for my household. \n\nLook, I know this sounds petty to some, and yes, we are blessed to have family and food, but I will not stand for being mistreated when my husband, daughter and myself put everything into providing something nice and basically get told it\u2019s not enough. \n\nWith attitudes like that, I do not plan hosting Christmas this year.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

To me, that would make me feel spoiled rotten!! I cannot even believe the audacity of your family to COME BACK THE NEXT DAY expecting you to hand them more containers of food?! That's like, crazy greedy. And that's without even inviting other people to help themselves to food from your house! WTF?! Who even does that? You're not a takeout restaurant. \n\nAbsolutely not.
