Not to shame him but because if he is losing weight this rapidly, it could be a dangerous health problem", "NTA. 10kg in a short amount of time is a lot of weight to lose without giving a reason.

It\u2019s reasonable to be concerned when someone you love suddenly loses a lot of weight.

Think it\u2019s best you sit down and actually convert to him that you\u2019re worried about him and would like to know if maybe he\u2019d like to see a professional to see if such weight loss is normal or how you can support him in finding help for the issue.", "NTA.

If you approach the subject again, apologise for a lack of tact and make it clear you're concerned. I lost a lot of weight very quickly once and found out I had cancer.

However, what he said is not nice either.", "Honestly, is OP's BF  using??\nMy first thought with the description of his behavior,  \"mind your own business\" sounds like he knows why he's gotten thinner and didn't want to talk about it. But instead of leaving it there, he then turned it around and attacked OP. I think it sounds like stimulant addiction behavior. JS\nOr maybe he's just concerned about it as well, and didn't know how to handle it, especially if already feeling self conscious about it. \nBut he may have something medically wrong. That's a very rapid weight loss to be concerned about. He needs to get checked out. \n\nOP is NTA for being concerned. But kinda TA for delivery. \nMaybe just explain to him that you're just worried about him, and urge him to see a Dr. You'll find out what you need to know at that point by how he reacts.", "You can't just assume someone is sick because they are thin. You asked in a very judgemental way and then acted like you solved a problem for him, and now your feelings are hurt because he mentioned your weight. It wasn't kind, but I'm starting to do that now because I don't like people commenting on my body- especially because I get a lot of uninvited negative comments from strangers about something they know nothing about.

Showing concern by pointing out someone's appearance is not ok, no matter whether they're losing or gaining weight. I understand you want to help but there are many other ways to approach it.

Him bodyshaming you to prove his point isn't cool either.", "That much weight loss over that little time is indicative of a potentially very serious medical issue. \"You need to eat more\" was not the right approach. That being said, his response kind of makes me want to just say NTA leave his scrawny ass. \"Mind your own business.\" I'll probably get some hate for this, but your partner's appearance, weight, and health is certainly your business. If my partner suddenly decided to get obese, you bet I would say something. Or if she suddenly dropped a ton of weight in a concerning amount of time, I'd point it out. And if she basically said \"mind your own business,\" then I would absolutely do that as a newly single man. Whether any of you like it or not, you have an obligation to your partner, as well as yourself, to take care of yourself.\n\nLet's not gloss over the fact that this is very concerning, though, and you should probably try to convince him to get checked out.", "What you meant to do: NTA. \n\nWhat you actually did: YTA. \n\nYou noticed your BF was losing weight really fast. You're concerned for his health, so you pointed out the problem and suggested a solution. Thing is.... It's the wrong problem, and probably the wrong solution, too. \n\nGuys get pressure about their bodies, too, you know. Maybe not quite as intensely/constantly as women, but it's there. And the pressure is to be big and solid and strong. If he's losing weight and getting really skinny... It's probably *not* because he's trying to. So, telling him that he's getting really tiny is kind of an insult. \n\nHis quip about your weight wasn't meant to tell you that you're fat. You're fine. He was pointing out that all you really said to him was, \"You're getting uglier.\" And that hurts. You would be hurt if he said that to you. You *are* hurt, just because he pretended to say it to you. That wasn't a constructive way to bring up the issue. \n\nGoing back to \"he's not trying to lose weight\"... If it's *not* intentional, *why* is it happening? Maybe he's too stressed to eat. Maybe he's developing a serious medical problem. I once knew a teenage boy who lost 15 pounds in a single weekend, because he didn't know he was diabetic. His blood sugar got so fucked up, his body went into a severe state of ketosis and burned through every last ounce of fat he had at once. He could've died if he didn't get to the hospital fast enough. \n\nWhatever is going on, \"eat more\" probably isn't actually what he needs to do. So, it's a really callous and dismissive suggestion about what might be a very serious, even life-threatening problem. \n\nSince you say his behavior has been poor for a while... I'm going to guess he's going through something emotionally: stress at work, death in the family, *something.* He's not talking to you about it, which is not a great sign for the longevity and stability of your relationship, but it might also reflect his beliefs that \"men are strong\" and don't need to talk about their problems or emotions. Some guys are like that, but it's actually not healthy for them to bottle things up like that. Of course, the fact that it's not healthy doesn't mean he's going to stop doing it. \n\nIf you want to address this again, I think you should start with an apology. You phrased your first attempt terribly. The suggestion to eat more was thoughtless.

He doesn't need you to spell out that he needs to consume more calories to gain weight. And eating more isn't always a simple solution. Maybe he's losing weight because he's sick, stressed, has an ED, etc. There are a lot of scenarios in which equating his weight loss to simply needing to eat more is belittling or invalidating.", "Please force him to go to the doctor. Weight loss like that is a really bad sign.", "NTA for your concern but YTA for how to went about it. Telling someone to eat more is skinny shaming. Comments like that hurt.

Lovely people.\n\nI'm not going to judge OP because I know she's genuinely concerned, but I will say telling someone to \"just eat more\" is bad form. It's not like most people don't know what they look like, and as stated, saying eat more can be triggering. Same with telling someone they're too (fill in the blank).\n\nSometimes, it's hard to talk about weight.

That way it isn't jumping to any assumptions about the cause of the weight loss, and doesn't come off as accusatory or demanding (not saying that it does sound like that to most people, but if you're not the best frame of mind, it is easy to take it pretty personally even when there's no real reason to). From my own experience with eating disorders, people straight up telling me to eat more has always led to me eating even less than I already did. My brain pushes back against things that sound like demands, a sort of \"I was going to do X, but now that you've told me to do it, I don't wanna\" mindset, whether I'm conscious of that being what I'm doing or not. \n\nOf course, an approach that works with one person won't always work with another. For me, it was people making me food that led to me eating more, because they put in the effort and I didn't want to disappoint them, especially if they were right there when I was eating (and thankfully I get so distressed by throwing up that even if I had thoughts of making myself doing so, I wouldn't). But that approach wouldn't necessarily work with someone else with the same issues. Being direct about it might work for other people. It's always a difficult situation when dealing with people with mental health issues because you never know what's going to help and what might make things worse. I am just looking at this from an eating disorder or other mental health issue point of view because that's what I've got experience with and that would be my own automatic assumption about OP's boyfriend, so I'm not sure what the correct approach would be for someone with a physical health issue or addiction as the cause.", "And sadly, a billion mothers across the world ignore that they have kids with EDs and those kinds of statements don't help.
