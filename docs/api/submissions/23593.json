Not to shame him but because if he is losing weight this rapidly, it could be a dangerous health problem", "NTA. 10kg in a short amount of time is a lot of weight to lose without giving a reason.

It\u2019s reasonable to be concerned when someone you love suddenly loses a lot of weight.

Think it\u2019s best you sit down and actually convert to him that you\u2019re worried about him and would like to know if maybe he\u2019d like to see a professional to see if such weight loss is normal or how you can support him in finding help for the issue.", "NTA.
