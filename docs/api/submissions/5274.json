Id ask the grand kids what they think. No one is ever going to replace your daughter, but your grand kid\u2019s family has extended.

Family is a complicated, malleable thing, nowadays more than ever. You will never love all family members the same, and not everyone's connection is as strong as others'. Think on this for a moment: had things turned out the other way around and now your daughter would be in a position where she's remerried and has a bunch of kiddos she's raising that are from her new husband's previous marriage, would you include them? I sure would. And Joe became your family the moment he married your daughter, so anyone in his family is your family. It would be slightly different if they parted because of a divorce, but they sadly did not. He did not leave your family, as heartbreking it is, your daughter did. \nOn the other hand I will say that Marie is a soft ahole for pushing this. I totally understand her stance, but she has no right to dictate who you include. Your family, your book, your decision. She can disagree, she can resent you, but she should not even bring this up. She can accept what she gets, but can't dictate it. \n\nSome compromises I can think of: she could start her own book. Families are also multi-dimensional, everyone has family members who are not part of their other family members' families. Or you could start a second book for larger family and friends. Or you could include pictures in frames of them in your home since you say they are welcome, but not family-welcome. So pictures, but not in the \"big book\" . Or if all the kids regularly visit you, you could stay firm about the photos in the book, but make something for ALL the kids like their own placemats at the table or something, that shows that you accept them all, even if they have different places in your \"social circle\" . When a problem doesn't seem to have a direct solution because a compromise is phisically not possible (you can't put half a picture in the book), all may benefit by looking at wider ideas.", "YTA- why not start a new book and include them in it if you are so precious about the original?

She isn\u2019t apart of OPs family history in any way shape or form. \n\nIf Joe had died and OPs daughter had married someone else and had stepkids that would be a different story.", "Her only grandchildren are the ones from her daughter so what other grandchildren are she playing favorites with?", "She is not related to op in any way and even the grandchildren agree. Just as the family of the children on their dad side is not included their stepmom that isn\u2019t even married to OP\u2019s child is not even close", "So just because that's how it is done in your family, other people should do the same?", "OP has no obligation to start a whole new book. Marie can do it if she's so butthurt over it.", "The only one tht seems narcissistic is you . My way or nothing .", "This isn't a family tree.", "Joe was only her relative through marriage so his marriage to Marie, children she brought to that marriage and children she has with Joe aren't on OP's family tree.", "The half sibling is not my grandchild.", "Why? Wouldn't that be better done by the family? OP is trying to get them to accept that they aren't her family so starting a new book for them seems counter productive.", "I\u2019m curious what the story with their actual grandparents are. What about joes parents? Why are the parents of a woman they\u2019ve never met their best option?", "I get the impression blending hasn't gone well and Joe and Marie want OP to force the issue. Marie and her children bear zero relation to OP, as frankly at this point does Joe.", ">Love that dad lied about his kids' feelings, too, glad grandma asked them directly.\n\nThat's so telling, isn't it? He knows that if his kids don't agree with him he basically has *no* case, so he's lying that they want it. I suspect that tells you a lot about how the kids' feelings have been handled throughout - I'd bet on a constant barrage of \"Marie is your *mother* now,\" \"The kids *want* Marie to take their mom's place,\" \"You know it's wrong not to call Marie mom,\" etc etc. \n\nGlad OP is still in those kids' lives, it limits the amount of erasure that Joe and Marie clearly would like.", "In this case I think its less Marie than the kids that are the driving force. She's just being protective mamma bear. Though it is a perfect teachable moment that \"while yes she is like a grandma to you, she is not your grandma. yes she is x and y's grandma, but not yours.\"", "There\u2019s no word for Marie, though. She\u2019s not a daughter in law. Legally, she\u2019s a random.", "OP kept in touch with Joe, her deceased daughter's husband, and her three grandchildren. It's great for Joe he found love again after a tragic loss, but his new wife Marie isn't OP's family. Marie's children from her previous relationship aren't her grandchildren. Joe's and Marie's child is also not her grandchild. \n\nThe only connection between OP and Marie is OP's grandchildren. Marie is the stepmother of OP's grandchildren, but has no real relationship with OP. OP likes Marie and is polite to her, but she is still basically a stranger to OP. And OP isn't obliged to have a (mother-daughter) relationship with her. You cannot force relationships like this. And it's wrong of Joe and Mary to demand it. \n\nThe genealogy scrapbook is from OP's family. She put her deceased daughter's family in it, meaning her husband Joe and their three children (her grandchildren). And now she expands it by adding her granddaughter's wife and their child. \n\nI totally agree with OP that there's no reason for OP to put Marie and her children in there, as they are not her deceased daughter's family and OP is not Marie's children's grandmother. The argument that OP should include them because her great-grandchild isn't biologically her granddaughter's is truly horrible (I don't know if the child is adopted or biologically granddaughter's wife's child, but it's still her granddaughter's child and therefore her great-grandchild). The only valid reason I can think of is if OP's grandchildren explicitly asked OP to put Marie in the book as their second mother, but they didn't. In fact it's exactly the opposite, they don't want Marie in the scrapbook.\n\nI wonder if Joe and Marie would make the same request to be in OP's genealogy scrapbook if OP's daughter was still alive. Maybe that point of view opens their eyes to how ridiculous they are to demand to be in it.\n\nNTA.", "Imagine trying to replace the dead ex wife in her own family. What is her home life like? Somethings got to be going on to make her think this way.", "Hmmm, yet she seems to have an issue with your eldest grand daughter and *wife* adopting, using a surrogate, donor sperm or egg or the child being a stepchild both have taken parental rights for. \n\nSo she can adopt herself in as a grown ass adult against anyone else\u2019s full agreement but if your great grandchild is not related by blood due to their parents being in a same sex relationship then adoption is not family?\n\nDid she always show her homophobia or is this big announcement of it? Because she\u2019s been around a while and so has the scrapbook. But she just happens to feel a child joining a same sex couple to make a family unit was the moment she just couldn\u2019t stop her and declare how it has eaten away at her?\n\nHow incredibly coincidental\u2026\n\nNTA but this isn\u2019t \u2018just\u2019 about step kids. It\u2019s a straight up statement she does not believe GD and wife have a \u2018real\u2019 child because they didn\u2019t make a baby the old school cishet way. That is a hill to die on whereas if it was about blended family dynamics you could could bat it back.\n\nBut can\u2019t bat bigotry back. She wants you to \u2018accept\u2019 her and her kids to prove you \u2018reject\u2019 the child of two wives. Her homophobic views mean she is essentially picking a fight with a child and trying to get back up to her BS. That will definitely foster love for her from you \ud83d\ude12", "I\u2019m step and I in no way shape or form try to do any of what you stated above I actually actively corrected my step kids from calling me mom till one day their actual mom heard it and said don\u2019t correct them at their dads house you are their mom. I\u2019m ok with it.\n\nNot all step-parents are like this step-parent but sadly it is becoming more and more common. But either way OP you\u2019re not the Asshole and you do what your daughters children want since their dad can\u2019t manage to do that", "She went beyond forcing a relationship with the kids. She's trying to replace OPs daughter in the family book. Exactly how entitled does one have to be to try to replace someone's dead kid?", "I am petty, I would create the book and predominately display so the Grandmother could see it when  she drops by. I also would put everyone in it but her.", "YES. Adopted family = Family. \n\nWhereas there isn't even a word for the relation between OP and Marie and her family. Step-in-laws?", "Joe is connected because OP's grandchildren are minors. Joe can control how much contact they have with their grandparent (or anyone else).\n\nOnce the children are adults, OP will not have to have a relationship with Joe at all.", "But he's not in the line of consanguinity. \n\nLook, if Joe and OP's daughter had never had children, after the daughter died Joe would have had no relationship at all with OP. The only reason that Joe continues to be a part of her life is because the kids exist. And once the kids are adults and no longer need Joe's permission to visit OP, she likely won't have a relationship with Joe at all. \n\nFor example, if there were a family reunion now, Joe would likely need to be invited to facilitate the kids' presence. In five years or so, when they're likely to be living independently, the kids will be invited, perhaps with their own significant others and kids, but Joe and Marie won't. That relationship will fade away.", "Sure Marie and Joe have been married for years but that has absolutely nothing to do with OP. \nOP NTA. Marie sounds like a toxic stepmother, please take care of your grandchildren.", "Ahh that was confusing but makes their behavior even worse, it was a branch in the book completely unrelated to them in the first place.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking. Why not start their own? Then they can choose to include you and any other bio or other grandparents. \n\nMay I ask where the parents of Joe, Marie, and the stepkids\u2019 father are? It seems that, at the very least, the parents of either Joe or Marie are best placed to do this, since they have more of a connection to all (or more) children than you.  ETA - just read your comment about Joe\u2019s parents not being around. Maybe that, plus issues with blending the families, is why he is pushing for this. But still, I think if Marie feels this strongly, she or her parents should start this. \n\nBut you shouldn\u2019t have to leave it behind. Your whole family is in it. Ot has the memories of your daughter. It is going to need updating for your grandchildren. It is a living document that is a lovely reminder of the people whom you love.", "ok, fair enough.   I am more than willing to believe I could be wrong here. I declined to give judgement for that very reason.", "Sorry, I misread....", "Step-daughter-in-law?\nWe really have no word or short phrase that describes Marie's position to OP.", "Yes, legally. But this isn't about legality. I don't say op should accept her or like her or anything. But she didn't walk in yesterday, she has been there for some time now. \n\nI think I am just used to accepting people in the family. That's what my parents always did. People were considered family quickly.", "I just feel for OP because she has the grief of losing her daughter and now Marie is like \"instead you have me\". That would just hurt so much on top of the her already very painful loss.", "She doesn't want to be in their family book, and why does pettiness need to happen here? She's not just not putting them in there to be hurtful, his kids with another woman aren't her family. And her grandkids don't want them in there so I'm missing where OP is the bad guy here?", "I\u2019ve heard women refer to their ex-husband\u2019s new wife as their step-wife. But it\u2019s different here.", "But Marie married her late daughter\u2019s widowed husband. \u201cAccepting her into the family\u201d would probably feel like she\u2019s accepting a replacement for her daughter. \n\nAnd frankly, it sounds like that\u2019s what Joe is trying to force.", "When my brother-in-law and his girlfriend moved in together, I started referring to her as \u201cAuntie\u201d when talking to my son. Even though she wasn\u2019t legally his aunt.\n\nBut there\u2019s no word for this woman. It\u2019s not like family.", "She doesn\u2019t add pictures of her grandkids family on their father\u2019s side.  They are also the kids\u2019 family but not on the same side of the family as OP.", "She's only her bio grandkids family. She has no relation to Marie or her kids. Even saying their kid with OPs ex son in law is her family is still false. That man isnt married to her daughter anymore so he is legally not family anymore. She only shares blood with bio grandkids.", "While it could be they see Marie and their step/halfsiblings as their new family, they obviously don't consider them part of their maternal extended family. Nothing wrong with that.", "But your granddaughter adopted the baby and sees them as her child.  That is the difference.  To your granddaughter this is her child and so you also see this as your great grandchild."]}
