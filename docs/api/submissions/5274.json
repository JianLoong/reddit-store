Marie has a son and a daughter from a previous marriage and she and Joe have a 5 year old together. We get along with Marie and the other children. Though I would not say we are very close, and we are definitely not like we were when my daughter was alive. That appears to now be a problem.\n\nYou see, there is a book. A scrapbook type of book. Where we add new members of the family to it and the children born get little updates about them until they're grown. It was started by my grandmother and continued by my mother and now me. It's not in the best condition but we cherish it in the family and those who are gone, when we look back, there's little memories in there to make us smile.\n\nI do not have Marie or any of her children in this book. But they are aware of the books existence from Joe and from my grandchildren. My oldest granddaughter and her wife became parents recently and the book became a hot topic. Marie was unhappy that my great-grandchild was included, but not her and her kids, because my great-grandchild is not related by blood. Joe told me the kids would love to have their whole family added to it. But then my grandchildren claimed something different. It has become such a mess. Joe, Marie and I eventually sat down to discuss it and they told me they feel like Marie and the kids should be shown full acceptance as part of the whole family and included. Marie also added that she should be added where Joe is, which is pages joined to my daughter's. I said that would never happen. She told me she and her kids are just as much part of my family. I told her she is not. I made it very clear she will never be my daughter. Joe told me it would set a good example for my grandchildren, for them to fully embrace Marie and the children, to drop the need for step, and see that they are all accepted just as much as he and they are. I told him I could not do that. That I love him. That I love my grandchildren. But I do not love Marie or their other children. That I like them and they are good to have around, but it is not the same.\n\nThey're angry. My grandchildren are upset their dad wanted Marie and the other kids to be in the book. Marie called me a terrible grandmother and person and that she had told her kids I was grandma and now I had made their lives so much more terrible.\n\nAITA?\n\nAdding in for clarity.

Id ask the grand kids what they think. No one is ever going to replace your daughter, but your grand kid\u2019s family has extended. The love for your daughter hasn\u2019t changed, there\u2019s just more love in their lives.", "NTA. But that's doesn't mean you're totally in the right. Family is a complicated, malleable thing, nowadays more than ever. You will never love all family members the same, and not everyone's connection is as strong as others'. Think on this for a moment: had things turned out the other way around and now your daughter would be in a position where she's remerried and has a bunch of kiddos she's raising that are from her new husband's previous marriage, would you include them? I sure would. And Joe became your family the moment he married your daughter, so anyone in his family is your family. It would be slightly different if they parted because of a divorce, but they sadly did not. He did not leave your family, as heartbreking it is, your daughter did. \nOn the other hand I will say that Marie is a soft ahole for pushing this. I totally understand her stance, but she has no right to dictate who you include. Your family, your book, your decision. She can disagree, she can resent you, but she should not even bring this up. She can accept what she gets, but can't dictate it. \n\nSome compromises I can think of: she could start her own book. Families are also multi-dimensional, everyone has family members who are not part of their other family members' families. Or you could start a second book for larger family and friends. Or you could include pictures in frames of them in your home since you say they are welcome, but not family-welcome. So pictures, but not in the \"big book\" . Or if all the kids regularly visit you, you could stay firm about the photos in the book, but make something for ALL the kids like their own placemats at the table or something, that shows that you accept them all, even if they have different places in your \"social circle\" . When a problem doesn't seem to have a direct solution because a compromise is phisically not possible (you can't put half a picture in the book), all may benefit by looking at wider ideas.", "YTA- why not start a new book and include them in it if you are so precious about the original?
