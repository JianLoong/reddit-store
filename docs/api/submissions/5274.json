Id ask the grand kids what they think. No one is ever going to replace your daughter, but your grand kid\u2019s family has extended.

Family is a complicated, malleable thing, nowadays more than ever. You will never love all family members the same, and not everyone's connection is as strong as others'. Think on this for a moment: had things turned out the other way around and now your daughter would be in a position where she's remerried and has a bunch of kiddos she's raising that are from her new husband's previous marriage, would you include them? I sure would. And Joe became your family the moment he married your daughter, so anyone in his family is your family. It would be slightly different if they parted because of a divorce, but they sadly did not. He did not leave your family, as heartbreking it is, your daughter did. \nOn the other hand I will say that Marie is a soft ahole for pushing this. I totally understand her stance, but she has no right to dictate who you include. Your family, your book, your decision. She can disagree, she can resent you, but she should not even bring this up. She can accept what she gets, but can't dictate it. \n\nSome compromises I can think of: she could start her own book. Families are also multi-dimensional, everyone has family members who are not part of their other family members' families. Or you could start a second book for larger family and friends. Or you could include pictures in frames of them in your home since you say they are welcome, but not family-welcome. So pictures, but not in the \"big book\" . Or if all the kids regularly visit you, you could stay firm about the photos in the book, but make something for ALL the kids like their own placemats at the table or something, that shows that you accept them all, even if they have different places in your \"social circle\" . When a problem doesn't seem to have a direct solution because a compromise is phisically not possible (you can't put half a picture in the book), all may benefit by looking at wider ideas.", "YTA- why not start a new book and include them in it if you are so precious about the original?

I\u2019m also married to a widower, we live in the house he shared with her, their kids still live here & their pictures are all over the house. My one request was that we move her pictures from our bedroom to the family room because that just felt a little awkward for me \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f  I also haven\u2019t met any of her family and certainly didn\u2019t demand that me & my kids get added to her family photo album.", "I wish my grandpas gf thought this way. She\u2019s destroyed countless traditions and made my grandfather sell his house that he lived in with my grandmother because it made her uncomfortable. She\u2019s done more and at this point my family is polite to her for my grandfathers sake but that\u2019s it.", "I definitely agree it's not all step-parents.  It's just on here I see several stories each day about step-parents trampling over boundaries. The good news is that I've also seen stories like yours where there are great relationships and people who understand and navigate this situation well.  It's so awesome you built a great relationship with your step-kids and that they have a mother who also understands and values your relationship with them (that's a whole other issue that I also see a lot of on here).\n\n I actually have a great relationship with my dad (who is actually my step-dad, but adopted me), and my mom really struggled with the fact that my younger siblings did not have the same relationship with her current husband that I did with their dad. It's because my bio is a POS, who was never in my life, and our dad was always a great father to all of us that they were never going to have that kind of relationship.", "I did the same for my son's girlfriends kids. (Close family friends so I have known them since birth) we finally settled on mimi for me. I don't think I have earned grandma.", "Marie completely missing the point the adopted child was adopted by the DAUGHTER and DAUGHTER in law. Marie is NEITHER.", "I asked to be able to, and then created a little memory display for her. It\u2019s just to the left of the front entry way, at the entrance to the living room. I used her piano as the centerpiece, then made a display with their wedding photo in the middle, surrounded by pictures of their family through the years, and added a few of her favorite objects. \n\nI have made a lot of changes to this house, but I want to make sure her memory is honored as the central part of all of their lives she was and still is. She was an extraordinary human and her children and widow deserve nothing less.", "Yea she understands and loves my relationship with the kids her and i relationship that\u2019s a whole other level of negativity but on my love and devotion to the kids there\u2019s never been a problem thank god lol", "For me it\u2019s all about respect and making sure the actual parent is ok with it and if not respecting the boundary if the other parent is involved and active if they are dead beats that haven\u2019t made effort and bounced early on than it\u2019s the kids call in my opinion.", "It seems to be a real theme of these stepfamily posts sadly. Being a stepparent must be so difficult but it seems like so many couples are trying to force kids to accept the new spouse as a parent instead of respecting that the children have their own feelings and loyalties.  \n\nMarie could have built a wonderful relationship with the kids if she just took a step back and realised that they have a mom who she can never replace, and that the three grandchildren have a bond of shared memories and grief with their mom\u2019s family that they will never have with their step and half siblings.  It doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t all have a loving and meaningful relationship, and have their own stories and memories, but that\u2019s her book, not the OPs.", "YTA. HUUUUUUGE asshole", "YTA \n\nIf your daughter saw how you were treating the love of her life, the man that made you a grandma like such crap I think she would be devastated\n\nI am part of the dead parent club and because of issues such as these now as an 30 year old adult I have no contact with that side of the family.", "Nta. Your great grandchild is legally yours. \nJoe could marry 10 other women doesn't mean you are obliged to add any of them. As Joe is not your son. He is your son in law.

But the audacity to demand this of you is ridiculous. The fact that your grandchildren aren\u2019t happy with what Marie is asking for shows you\u2019re right to deny them access to the book. NTA. The nerve.", "NTA. Especially the kids don't want that. \nMaybe there is something other behind thks request?\n\nMaybe she should start her own book?

I don't know how parents survive losing their child.", "Nope NTA. The wife of your deceased son in law is not your family.  That\u2019s she trying to bludgeon her way into a relationship is kinda incredible.  She doesn\u2019t get to replace your daughter.  \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "NTA as I think you were forced to verbalize that you don\u2019t have the same love for your SIL\u2019s wife & stepkids.  This sounds awful but it is normal.  Yes, there are people out there who\u2019ll consider everyone & anyone family and that\u2019s good for them but doesn\u2019t work for everyone.Doesn\u2019t your SIL have parents he should bug about accepting his stepkids?\nThe simple fact is that if the marriage was to breakup it\u2019d be very unlikely that the stepkids would reach out to you or that you\u2019d reach out to them.  I have no doubt that you care for them but you do not have an in breakable bond with them.  Your SIL was wrong to put you in an awkward position and if anything he should ask his wife not to make an issue about it and also ask his kids to avoid the topic with stepmom & step siblings.  If your SIL\u2019s new wife is so obsessed with being part of your family she needs therapy.\nCongratulations on your new great grandchild!", "NTA.   \n\n\nThe book is yours and you have every right to decide who you want to put in the book, esp. since Marie and her children are not your family.

It would be different if you felt love for them but they can\u2019t force their family into yours!", "NTA.

This is so strange ngl", "I been reading all this input and what not. From what I've seen myself, step parents have a similar theme, always trying to impose and force themselves into families that have nothing to do with them. It sucks and its selfish. And also unwanted and gets a lot of resentment", "Your grandchildren don't want it. That should be the end of discussion for Joe and Marie.   \nYou are NTA", "NTA I\u2019d repeat that the book is for direct descendants. Your children, their spouses, and their children and so on.

Marie didn't marry into your family, she married into Joe's family.  You are not obligated to include her, or her children, as they are not directly related to you.  Your grandchildren are clear they want it the way you do.   Joe and Marie can feel disappointed about that, but that's on them and just too bad.  Nothing is stopping them from making their own book for their own family.", "NTA- Marie is more than welcome to start her own family scrap book and do her own side- being sure to add in her ex and other children he may have had with his partner(s) and that whole linage.", "NTA. She needs to know her place.", "NTA and you owe them nothing. \n\nIf you wanted to do something to extend an olive branch of some kind, maybe make them their own book. You totally don't have to, but it might help keep the peace.", "NTA\n\nThey are not your family. They are your grandchildren's family. Big distinction there. If your grandchildren ASK to have them in there, then you can consider it.", "Definitely NTA.  It's sad how many blended families come here (to AITA) with folks attempting to force relationships and erase others memories. It's ridiculous she and her children have absolutely no right whatsoever to be in that book. Die on this hill op you're I'm the right here, maybe they could make a new book with them in it or whatever but this generational book you have they have no right to be in.", "Don't know if you're TA, but Marie and her kids have been around for a while now if they have a 5 year old together. You said that Marie told them you were their grandma, did they actually call you grandma? This is confusing to me, you say your \"oldest grandaughter\" and her wife became parents, I'm assuming you aren't talking about the 17 year old, so if you refer to Marie's daughter as your grandaughter, and include her child in the book, why wouldn't you include the mother?", "NTA, but I have seen a similar situation play out in my family. I hope you are prepared to not have access to your grandchildren anymore. While you don\u2019t have to include everyone( which is okay) the tension is now high and you are enemy target one. You sat down it seemed like to come to a compromise, yet no actual compromise happened. Is there any wiggle room? I hate the thought of where this situation is more then likely going.", "NTA, but think about it.\nMy grandmother believed in \u201cfamily is who you love, not about who you relate to in blood\u201d. She has been dead for 20 years now, we - her family, whether we are blood related or not- still celebrates her birthday. \n\nIf you like them, why not consider them family? In the long run it\u2019s about love and respect, not the % of DNA you share.", "NTA, You are the keeper of the book so you get to decide who goes in it. I cannot believe Marie does not get that she is not a part of your family in that sense. She just does not want to hear it. Even your daughter's children agree with you. But you know what, even that does not matter, it is your book. Stand your ground!", "NTA. This sounds like a lovely book and tradition in your family- it's a shame that it has turned become the subject of an argument. \n\nI don't think you should feel that you need to include them. However, the book could also evolve like your family has. You could add a \"New Additions\" section at the end for people with messages and photos of those who marry in, etc. It would keep the original family memories together while involving everyone and giving an even fuller picture of your family- just an idea", "NTA! Marie and Joe are the biggest AHs here.", "YTA for sure", "Why don't they start their own book?....", "I could not believe I had to scroll this far for this! Suggesting that an adopted child, or a child that is only technically biologically related to OPs granddaughter-in-law is so homophobic, just so absolutely appalling. OP brings up her gay granddaughter in such a casual, no problem easy which is so heartwarming. And then this monster basically says that kids of gay parents aren't really part of the family.\n\nDoes everyone know this comment was made? I'd be coming swinging at Marie saying that even if there was a chance that maybe they'd be a sort of adopted part of the family at some point way down the line, there's no chance now after her bigoted comment about people actually in her family.", "Uh, what part is that they aren't her relatives?\n\nThese kids have never met her daughter & aren't related to her. The kids have existing set of grandparents before married husband. They aren't legally nor emotionally binding to OP's daughter nor her. \n\nHer daughter didn't give birth to them, raise nor adopt them. OP's own grandchildren by son-in-law don't want them included. Her husband who is now no longer a valid husband to the deceased daughter, is married to a second wife. Other than legally married, was never part of OP's family. He's making it he's connected to OP not her daughter. Son-in-law and his new wife are as related to them as they are to any of us which means not.\n\nWho is to believe what the son-in-law & wife are saying after they lied about his children agreeing to this. It's one thing to be included and another to be pressured into accepting others that aren't your kin disrespecting the person who's deceased not accepting their presence.\n\nI still believe this is some form of way to get inheritance, trust funds or whatever. Poor people don't argue over a family bible or mementos.", "The sentiment behind it isn't the problem. It's that they're batshit to think his deceased wife's parents should be included in the whole \"step kids are family\" thing. I'd think it was a perfectly reasonable request if they were *his own* parents that had this tradition, and even then it's kind of ehhh on anyone being an asshole if they didn't. But to think his deceased wife's parents need to add his \"replacement\" wife and her kids in their family album? Nuh uh.", "I'm completely confused by this, because the oldest grandaughter is 17? Assumed it referred to one of the kinda-step grandaughters?", "This just reminds me of how my son's step mother privately refers to herself as bonus mom to others and me as bio mom to imply that I'm an absent parent. Despite the fact that I've always been in my son's life and cared for him, and have primary custody.", "Yes I understand that but they share a blood relationship with the grandkids so we just gonna ignore the half sibling?", "YAWN\n\n\nIt goes without saying that *I* am an asshole, BUT *I* am not asking for judgement.  Don't get over eager, asshole in training.", "She sucks because she is immovable about a tradition that is clearly hurting people. Think of all the traditions that are becoming more and more uncomfortable to celebrate because they hurt people. Do we hold onto those for all time because \u201ctradition\u201d? Or do we acknowledge the perhaps unintended effect on groups of people and we change?", "And the last part where Marie told her kids that OP is grandma. That is completely out of line. You can\u2019t be a terrible grandmother to kids who aren\u2019t your grandchildren. NTA.", "At least Joe is the father of OP's grandchildren. Marie is just Joe's second wife, and the key thing is that she has no relation to the grandkids.", "Oldest granddaughter by way of deceased daughter is 17. OP probably has other children, with older children.", "You can't make that designation at all. It's not uncommon at all for a widowed spouse to stay around their dead spouses family.\n\nMy \"uncle\" was my Aunt's (grandpops sister) husband. She died and he was never ousted from the family, their kids were grown and in college when my Aunt died. My Uncle's new wife was also accepted fully into the family, and stayed a family member until the day he died. My grandpop still talks to his 2nd wife a few times a year. \n\nIf I died today my mom isn't going to stop having a relationship with my wife.\n\nThis whole comment of yours is terrible, saying that the only reason OP keeps a relationship with Joe is because of him bringing the kids around. OP has known Joe for at minimum 17 years based on the oldest child's age.\n\nNow Joe could easily form a wedge by pressing this issue on the book, but that has nothing to do with how he's connected to the family, a blood relative could easily form wedges in family relationships.", "A lot of families with half siblings do on account of that not being the half sibling's family. Their mother would be the side the half sibling gets the grandparent attention from if they're around. I don't understand this thought process that children that came from a deceased or divorced parent are expected to include the siblings not related to that side.", "Spoiler alert: they'll never add Marie. She's trying to replace and erase their mother, they'll never love her like that.", "I think it all depends on the connection people have. In this case OP writes she's not very close with Joe, her deceased daughter's husband.\n\n>Though I would not say we are very close, and we are definitely not like we were when my daughter was alive. \n\nAnd OP definitely doesn't appreciate Joe's and Marie's current demands and behaviour. So I think it's very likely that in this case the relationship between OP and Joe will fade away when OP's grandchildren are adults and can visit OP without their father.", "That\u2019s lovely. Nobody should be expected to quit loving someone special just because that someone died.", "Joe's parents are in OPs grand kids family. \n\nDo you think they need to be added as well?  s/"]}
