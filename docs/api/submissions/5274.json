Id ask the grand kids what they think. No one is ever going to replace your daughter, but your grand kid\u2019s family has extended. The love for your daughter hasn\u2019t changed, there\u2019s just more love in their lives.", "NTA. But that's doesn't mean you're totally in the right. Family is a complicated, malleable thing, nowadays more than ever. You will never love all family members the same, and not everyone's connection is as strong as others'. Think on this for a moment: had things turned out the other way around and now your daughter would be in a position where she's remerried and has a bunch of kiddos she's raising that are from her new husband's previous marriage, would you include them? I sure would. And Joe became your family the moment he married your daughter, so anyone in his family is your family. It would be slightly different if they parted because of a divorce, but they sadly did not. He did not leave your family, as heartbreking it is, your daughter did. \nOn the other hand I will say that Marie is a soft ahole for pushing this. I totally understand her stance, but she has no right to dictate who you include. Your family, your book, your decision. She can disagree, she can resent you, but she should not even bring this up. She can accept what she gets, but can't dictate it. \n\nSome compromises I can think of: she could start her own book. Families are also multi-dimensional, everyone has family members who are not part of their other family members' families. Or you could start a second book for larger family and friends. Or you could include pictures in frames of them in your home since you say they are welcome, but not family-welcome. So pictures, but not in the \"big book\" . Or if all the kids regularly visit you, you could stay firm about the photos in the book, but make something for ALL the kids like their own placemats at the table or something, that shows that you accept them all, even if they have different places in your \"social circle\" . When a problem doesn't seem to have a direct solution because a compromise is phisically not possible (you can't put half a picture in the book), all may benefit by looking at wider ideas.", "YTA- why not start a new book and include them in it if you are so precious about the original?
