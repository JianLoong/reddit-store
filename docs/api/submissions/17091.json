That being said, I doubt your parents are going to bend on this much since it sounds like they\u2019re too caught up in themselves to care how it\u2019s affecting your siblings.

(I know they are old enough not to need one, but the concept would be the same)", "NTA.  They ASKED you what the problem was, you told them.  They didn't like the answer - that's on them, not you.  If it were me, I'd ask them if they ever want to have an adult relationship with their kids or to even get introduced to any possible grandchildren because if they keep on like they are - prioritizing their personal sexual needs over their children - chances are those swingers are going to be the only family they have in another 5 years.", "NTA. That\u2019s your siblings house as well, and your parents shouldn\u2019t have had kids if they feel otherwise. Gross and inappropriate. Get a hotel or go to their house.

I would go so far as to call it repulsive, in fact. \n\nIf they had raised their children in a sexually open environment, I would feel differently. But to change the sexual dynamic of the parents in the household when the children are grown and have internalized certain norms and expectations is really messed up. \n\nA lot of people whose parents start swinging when they're teenagers go NC as adults for exactly this reason. Your parents are placing their sexual gratification and \"fairness\" to their childless sexual partners over the mental and emotional wellbeing of their minor children. That's despicable.\n\nThey are also fundamentally involving their minor children, non-consensually, in their sexual relationship. That's not cool.", "Depending on where you are call CPS...that is not right", "NAH.\n\nI had no idea it was considered immoral for parents to have sex under their own roof if they have children.

I guess they could have told your siblings we have sex with other couples but that would have been an awkward conversation too right? At 15 and 17 they know what their parents are doing and they have a right to their feelings but at the same time they aren't being subjected to hearing it or seeing it. Despite how weird the situation might be, your parents can have whatever type of sex life they want.", "Based on what I read, YTA.

So what? I love some pancakes whether or not they are enjoyed with a casual partner and that's noone else's business. Same with your parents. You don't get to decide what's right and wrong for them in the bedroom.", "[deleted]", "NAH. You can ask them but ultimately it's their house and their rules. Your siblings aren't toddlers or even children. They're teenagers grossed out that their parents are having sex with others. It's not illegal and they're not exposed to or forced to watch any of it.

Are your siblings actually seeing/hearing/exposed to anything other than adults having a meal or coffee together?", "NTA. CPS would have a lot to say about the situation.

They are being passively involved in their parents fetish which is entirely wrong. If a conversation about this took place once the youngest is 16 (I am using this age as it is legal age of consent in my country) and they have no problem with it then it would be one thing but the parents are making it blatantly obvious what is going on and forcing their children to realise it but not even having the decency to speak to them. It\u2019s very irresponsible and could be very damaging because they are sending their children bizarrely mixed messages.

I'd say they are assuming, but OP says the parents confirmed it.\n\nWhat I mean is, 15 and 17 year old kids don't want to think about their parents having sex.  I don't really get that, but I know it is common.  They can pretend their parents enter the bedroom and go to sleep if they aren't seeing or hearing anything.  The swinging part isn't the problem per se, it is that because the friends are staying over, they assume the parents are having sex and it is that ick factor leading to their reaction more than the swinging.\n\nDefinitely warrants a discussion between the parents and kids.  I would hope that parents that not only swing, but do it at home with kids in the other wing of the house, wouldn't believe in having \"the talk\" and considering things finished but rather have been having continuing, age appropriate discussions where sex isn't such a taboo topic, but that seems to be the case here.

OP has said it has been made obvious to the siblings what has been going on but it has been done without any real acknowledgment. The parents are basically letting them see what is happening, but without addressing it they are tacitly telling their children it is a subject they should not bring up. \nI\u2019m simply saying I don\u2019t think that is a fair thing for young minds to deal with. Either keep your personal life personal and make sure your children are not affected or if you choose to have them know what is going on at least make it a subject they feel they are allowed to discuss with you.

I think I could compromise on that being acceptable, because my main issue is the potential unsupervised access to the kids.\n\n To me, it seems like your logic follows that if the parents have a date night, then the kids would know they're gonna bone, making the kids uncomfortable, so they shouldn't have sex in the house. And reversing that, even if the parents do have sex at the other guys house, then the kids would know they were going out to get sex and that would also be uncomfortable.
