That being said, I doubt your parents are going to bend on this much since it sounds like they\u2019re too caught up in themselves to care how it\u2019s affecting your siblings.

(I know they are old enough not to need one, but the concept would be the same)", "NTA.  They ASKED you what the problem was, you told them.  They didn't like the answer - that's on them, not you.  If it were me, I'd ask them if they ever want to have an adult relationship with their kids or to even get introduced to any possible grandchildren because if they keep on like they are - prioritizing their personal sexual needs over their children - chances are those swingers are going to be the only family they have in another 5 years.", "NTA. That\u2019s your siblings house as well, and your parents shouldn\u2019t have had kids if they feel otherwise. Gross and inappropriate. Get a hotel or go to their house.

I would go so far as to call it repulsive, in fact. \n\nIf they had raised their children in a sexually open environment, I would feel differently. But to change the sexual dynamic of the parents in the household when the children are grown and have internalized certain norms and expectations is really messed up. \n\nA lot of people whose parents start swinging when they're teenagers go NC as adults for exactly this reason. Your parents are placing their sexual gratification and \"fairness\" to their childless sexual partners over the mental and emotional wellbeing of their minor children. That's despicable.\n\nThey are also fundamentally involving their minor children, non-consensually, in their sexual relationship. That's not cool.", "Depending on where you are call CPS...that is not right", "NAH.\n\nI had no idea it was considered immoral for parents to have sex under their own roof if they have children.

I guess they could have told your siblings we have sex with other couples but that would have been an awkward conversation too right? At 15 and 17 they know what their parents are doing and they have a right to their feelings but at the same time they aren't being subjected to hearing it or seeing it. Despite how weird the situation might be, your parents can have whatever type of sex life they want.", "Based on what I read, YTA. You're parents are sexual beings, that's most likely how you came about.

So what? I love some pancakes whether or not they are enjoyed with a casual partner and that's noone else's business. Same with your parents. You don't get to decide what's right and wrong for them in the bedroom.", "[deleted]", "NAH. You can ask them but ultimately it's their house and their rules. Your siblings aren't toddlers or even children. They're teenagers grossed out that their parents are having sex with others. It's not illegal and they're not exposed to or forced to watch any of it.

Are your siblings actually seeing/hearing/exposed to anything other than adults having a meal or coffee together?", "NTA. CPS would have a lot to say about the situation.

But again I will say\u2026 we do not have enough information.\n\nAnecdotal note, not my actual argument on the matter: I did the same shit when I was a teenager about my mother\u2019s (one) boyfriend/now husband. Which just for shits and giggles I\u2019ll note they\u2019re both monogamous. I told lots of people it was because he was an asshole. I didn\u2019t like him, but he wasn\u2019t actually actively a dick to anyone. We also lived in a tiny 2 bedroom, old apartment, so hear their sexual activities around 15/16 sometimes too despite their attempts to keep it down. When I was acting out should CPS have been called as well? (I\u2019m not trying to trap you) Personally my opinion? Absolutely not! My childhood friend was molested while in the system, after her grandmother (guardian and only living relative) had some health issues. I\u2019m not saying the system is bad. Again, all I\u2019m saying is let\u2019s not JUMP to conclusions - that could potentially have more dire consequences - when we don\u2019t have enough information to get there with.", "From OP\u2019s post:\n\n>Thankfully my parents room is on the opposite end of the house from my brother and sisters rooms, so even though they know what's going on, they never hear anything. \n\nAlso\n\n>My brother and sister are about to lose it, they can't deal with knowing what their parents are doing 30 feet away.\n\nu/peanutbuttertoast4 where is it you read these kids are being forced to listen to their parent\u2019s threesomes, foursomes and orgies? \n\nYou *also* seem to be making not just assumptions and are jumping to conclusions, but are actively disregarding the information presented\u2026", "The op said her siblings are about to lose it, I take that to mean they aren\u2019t doing well with this massive change in the family dynamic. Op said the parents swinger life style is affecting her siblings that\u2019s the info provided and one sibling said he doesn\u2019t care is cps is called", "Yes, teenagers are often affected if there are changes in their parents' romantic lives. It's also uncomfortable to acknowledge your parents as fully-rounded human beings who do things like have sex.\n\nThe failure is on the parents' communication and their approach to this whole situation. They should be validating their teens' feelings and prioritizing their comfort. They should think of a compromise where all parties are happy, namely schedule their meetings so that the kids aren't around.\n\nDoes it necessitate a call to CPS though ? Well. If the kids are \"about to lose it\" because of one major family dynamic change, I have bad news about how CPS will affect their lives.", "Also I\u2019m sorry your original comment is being downvoted \ud83d\ude15 it was a very kind observation and absolutely not something to be downvoted.", "Oh. Ha ha ha \ud83d\ude02 I hadn't even noticed it was being downvoted!"]}
