(I know they are old enough not to need one, but the concept would be the same)", "NTA.  They ASKED you what the problem was, you told them.  They didn't like the answer - that's on them, not you.  If it were me, I'd ask them if they ever want to have an adult relationship with their kids or to even get introduced to any possible grandchildren because if they keep on like they are - prioritizing their personal sexual needs over their children - chances are those swingers are going to be the only family they have in another 5 years.", "NTA. That\u2019s your siblings house as well, and your parents shouldn\u2019t have had kids if they feel otherwise. Gross and inappropriate. Get a hotel or go to their house.

I would go so far as to call it repulsive, in fact. \n\nIf they had raised their children in a sexually open environment, I would feel differently. But to change the sexual dynamic of the parents in the household when the children are grown and have internalized certain norms and expectations is really messed up. \n\nA lot of people whose parents start swinging when they're teenagers go NC as adults for exactly this reason. Your parents are placing their sexual gratification and \"fairness\" to their childless sexual partners over the mental and emotional wellbeing of their minor children.

I guess they could have told your siblings we have sex with other couples but that would have been an awkward conversation too right? At 15 and 17 they know what their parents are doing and they have a right to their feelings but at the same time they aren't being subjected to hearing it or seeing it. Despite how weird the situation might be, your parents can have whatever type of sex life they want.", "Based on what I read, YTA.

So what? I love some pancakes whether or not they are enjoyed with a casual partner and that's noone else's business. Same with your parents. You don't get to decide what's right and wrong for them in the bedroom.", "[deleted]", "NAH. You can ask them but ultimately it's their house and their rules. Your siblings aren't toddlers or even children. They're teenagers grossed out that their parents are having sex with others. It's not illegal and they're not exposed to or forced to watch any of it.

Are your siblings actually seeing/hearing/exposed to anything other than adults having a meal or coffee together?", "NTA. CPS would have a lot to say about the situation.

OP\u2019s parents are the ah in the situation, OP\u2019s comments are making them out to be a different ah though. They\u2019re processing, I get it! \u2764\ufe0f a lot to take in. It doesn\u2019t make them not an ah for it though, they could be inadvertently shaming someone else with their comments here. Someone who may be trying to figure out how best to have this convo with THEIR kids. \n\nTo clarify here, I\u2019m only expressing that OP needs to \u201cGTFOI\u201d regarding her shaming of her parents for being swingers or being sexual beings in general. ENM is a growing relationship style where monogamy has always been portrayed as the \u201cdefault\u201d was BS. Plus adults have sex \ud83d\ude44 \n\nOP is adult enough to know that acting out isn\u2019t acceptable and if you do, you\u2019re going to be called out on it to correct your behavior. I\u2019m not passing judgement or calling out OP for not enjoying/being proud that their parents are engaging in a swinger lifestyle, I\u2019m telling OP they need to put on their adult pants and get over it - other adults are going to live their sexual lives. OP\u2019s brain isn\u2019t *inherently* throwing them into a tizzy because they may not be able to process this properly. If they\u2019re struggling with it, they should seek professional assistance, not ask Reddit if they\u2019re being an ah or not.\n\nAll that to say, OP is absolutely, entirely allowed to hate it, cut their parents out of their life entirely over it even. Relationship dynamic changes like this for sure can be a world altering view, but OP\u2019s home/food/security etc. is no longer based on their parent\u2019s relationship dynamic and lifestyle choices\u2026 as OP\u2019s younger sibling\u2019s *are*.\n\n\nEdit: adding, imo OP\u2019s parents are also AH for not discussing this with OP before it becoming more of a public thing, though significantly less of a needed convo then with younger siblings.", "What\u2019s inherently wrong with fwbs? \n\nWhy do you think they have to have a formal relationship title?", "Once again, literally something people say about queer relationships. The fact that there are more than two people involved tells you literally nothing about what kind of sex they're having. Not a fetish, just a different kind of relationship.", "What exposing? The kids have never seen nor heard a single thing. \n\nAnd it is not a fetish ffs.", "Thank you for your thoughtful reply. This is a great discussion. \n\nI agree about going to therapy. It may be worth it for the whole family since they are all having a hard time navigating this situation it seems.", "Nothing and I don't, I just think exposing kids to it the way they are is a bad idea.", "I think this is one of those funky situations where communication needs to happen... somewhere. Teenagers can't be so young that they wouldn't understand but also old enough that they should be in line with adult autonomy. They exist in that fluid state in between and if the parents want this for their life, fine. But if this is such a big decision, why are they are scared to tell the kids? I'm not saying give em the gory details of bone town but some level of communication like \"Your father and I love each and you very much. But as you get older your needs change and we have such a deep friendship with these other people that we feel comfortable exploring what it's like to have other relationships.\"\n\nNot necessarily that statement (I am in no way qualified to discuss non monagomy) but something a little more up front then \"Expect Roger, Kate, Seth and Mia in robes at 6 o clock every Saturday morning.\"", "It's a fetish. They get people over to have sex. That's not a relationship.\nWho's queer? Didn't see that mentioned anywhere....", "Course it's a fetish lol\nThe kids are very aware of what is going on. It's very obviously going to make them uncomfortable. Let's not be silly", "Absolutely, and thank you as well! I\u2019m appreciating this comment thread and the other (respectful) commentary I\u2019m seeing from others as well. I also know text can come off rather harsh sometimes, and try to remember to break it up with emojis and such sometimes \ud83e\udd2a", "What do you mean by exposing kids to it? \n\nYou said your parents can\u2019t ever be heard. And they\u2019re never seen having sex I assume? \n\nWhat are they exposing?", "I'm saying that it's the same argument homophobes trot out to argue against \"exposing\" kids to queer relationships. That it's not normal/natural, that it's a fetish, etc. Also hate to break it to you, but a lot of people have people over to have sex. If a single parent has their partner spend the night, is that a fetish?", "They're teenagers. They'd be uncomfortable knowing their married parents have sex with each other. That's not a good metric.", "I am also appreciating this one! Skme enjoyable conversations and points of view! \n\nI will try your suggestion, you are very right about text not conveying tone. I never think to use emojis and that, I will try it more. \ud83d\ude0a", "Swinging is a fetish. Exposing to a fetish is different, and let's be honest, it's not the norm.\nThis is very obviously going to be uncomfortable for the kids, and they shouldn't have to deal with it. It's poor and inconsiderate parenting. They could swing at a hotel or someone else's house.", "The idea that there are a million ways to have a healthy sexual relationship, and the only thing that matters is that everyone participating consents? Scary stuff /s", "If a single parent is seeing someone (regardless of if they are same sex or straight), they are building a relationship with them. This person will be looking to build a relationship with the kids too. Very different to having a group of fwbs around.\nwhat's wrong with it being a fetish? Who said fetishes were bad? I'm merely saying it's out of the ordinary, and will obviously make kids uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, polyamorous and swinging are 2 different things. Swinging is a fetish.", "There's a big big difference. Including having strangers around your house that you know are getting jiggy with your parents lol", "Swinging is not a fetish wtf? \n\nPolyamory is not a fetish. It\u2019s the practice of engaging in multiple romantic (and typically sexual) relationships, with the consent of all the people involved.", "I mean the Bible has Jacob (father of Joseph) married to sisters Leah and Rachel, and having sex with two other women during his simultaneous marriages. \n\nIdk where people get the idea that polyamory is unnatural and wrong, because it sure as hell isn\u2019t from Christianity. Not to mention the fact that people used to accuse interracial and homosexual couples of being unnatural and we all know that\u2019s utterly bigoted.", "You're talking about it like they know their parents are into like cuckolding. Having a sexual relationship with more than one person is in no way a fetish. They could be having the most vanilla sex imaginable for all you know. And I think teenagers are old enough to know that sometimes people have sex with people they're not married to.", "> two other couples they've been friends with since I was a kid", "Polyamory lol\nIt's a fetish.\nI'm not judging them on their fetish, but I am judging them on exposing their kids to it.\nDo you think the kids should have to put up with these strangers sleeping over and being there?", "It would seem unnatural to these kids, who have known their parents to be monogamous until now.", "So you'd judge cuckolding but not swinging? Not very accepting of you. They're both fetishes. And in both scenarios the wife takes another guy, not that different lol", "You forgot the \"lol\""]}
