Caught it on Camera.", ">She gave it back when he said he'd call the police. He will have told his attorney.\n\nWhich doesn't mean anything BECAUSE SHE CAN DENY IT. You think that because he told his attorney that it automatically makes it true in the judges eyes. despite not having any evidence besides some reddit post?\n\n>it's in his name and he's paying for it.\n\nIn a divorce that doesn't matter, I've seen houses in men's names go to the ex-wife.

Even debt.\n\n> depending on location\n\nWhich is a big if since a significant majority of places DO take it into consideration when calculating child support even AFTER its been decided. Plenty of men end up paying more in child support once they get a raise.

My dad is pissed off that she actually got the strength to \"get the fuck out\" when he told her too, so he's being an absolute asshole but she still thinks they're going to be \"amicable\" about a divorce, even though he already has a lawyer.

What if she doesn't work and pay the car because she was a SAHM?", "My exh did this when we were close to splitting up... this is how messed up it was.  He first made both my drivers license and debit card dissappear so I couldn't go out for my bday with my friends. The idea was go to a restaurant both him and my brother worked at, my brother worked at the bar and would hook us up with food/drinks a lot, my ex was waiter.\n\nFrom there we were going dancing to celebrate my 29th... when I realized before leaving home I was missing both debit/drivers, I was able to find my passport to use for ID, and the girls said they would spot me, of I figured I could ask husband for cash while at restaurant.  My mom was watching our kiddos until he came back from work, then he would watch them and I told him I'd be home around 3am or so.  He had seemed so 'happy' for me to for once get a night out with my friends, oh how lovely, have a great time!!! (And then proceed to try and sabotage it).\n\nWe get to restaurant and sit at the bar where my brother works, after a while my stbx he approaches to say hi to me and my friends, I tell him I couldn't find my debit card at all, looked everywhere!!!  Could he lend me some cash?  He claimed he had nothing on him (this was several hours into his shift and he always carried cash on him).  So the girls said, no worries, will spot her later, my brother quipped he would take care of my tab anyways since it was my bday. .  He then asks if I'm still going out?  I say yes, why?  He says you didn't find your debit, what about your ID (I let him tell on himself here)- I said, well, that was missing too oddly, but I found my passport.\n\nHe proceeded to call dozens of times between midnight-2am -which I ignored, if it was an emergency or problem he would have texted or left a voicemail. I won't even go on to explain what happened when I got home, but it was hell, and my girlfriends all witnessed it all.\n\nA few days later, my passport went missing.  It was hella hard to get my drivers/debit replaced with no passport/other photo ID.   He would sit and see me furiously search every coat pocket/drawer/car/purses, etc...for ANY of the items.\n\nI had to depend on any cash he would miserly give out and drove around w/out a license until I could get it resolved.  After I FINALLY was able to get them both done, I was so relieved, figured I would then go on to get passport replaced.....then suddenly I see one of my purses out of place.  I decide to look through it one more time.  While searching I can feel what seems to be an id/passport but it's INSIDE the liner....so I look and there were no holes anywhere, I take a flaslight and find a sown up (sloppily) portion, I rip it open, and all 3 documents sitting right there.  He had taken them, hidden them, and eventually sown them into the purse, I never ever told them I found the 'lost items'. \n\nWe split about a month after but had to get a TPO to do it and flee my home with my sons.  He was an extremely abusive narcissisistic creep.", "I hope you\u2019re able to convince her to get a lawyer. Having lawyer to stand up for you is worth it.

But every time I talk to her I tell her she needs a lawyer and my Nana (her mom) is also telling her the same thing. So hopefully she actually does it soon.", "Then you go to the police, make a report about your passport being stolen. The detective assigned to the case will get your passport returned & you can press charges. \nShe just ruined her custody battle. She will be paying you child support.

My parents where fighting over custody of the 3 kids, ownership of the house and ownership of a riding mower. Now adult me understands why the courts felt it was in the best interest of the children to stay in their home and with a .5 acre yard the mower needed to stay with the house. So the deal was whom ever got the kids got the house and the mower. When kid me heard this I heard \"You are no better than a house and  a mower.\" I was no longer human, rather I was an object to fight over to them. \n\nSo on behave of kid me and all other kids of divorce, don't lump kids in with the objects.
