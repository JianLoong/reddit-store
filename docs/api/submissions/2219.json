You explained kindly why you could not put in more effort after already warning him you were feeling that way. Good for you for sticking up for yourself in a polite and healthy way", "NTA and your post is making me deeply wish I had done this with a friend sooner. It hurts when close, longtime friendships end but you deserve to be around people who prioritize you just as you do them, and Mark is missing out. That is no fault but his own.", "I don't see how lying could help him, it just kicks the problem down the road. You're being mature and it's good for him to hear the truth so that maybe he can mature as well.", "NTA. If you had of lied and kept on lying, you would have been the ahole. Your response was perfect and although he's upset now, Mark will be better off for it.", "NTA for sure and ur friend sounds hella immature lol surely he didn't learn about common sense?", "NTA at all. Hopefully losing your closeness helps him become a better friend to others in the future. Also, keep your integrity and don't lie.

Perhaps when he got a new girlfriend, she was uncomfortable with him keeping a close friendship with you. Instead of standing up to her and defending your friendship, or doing the minimally decent thing of explaining the situation to you, he simply stopped being your friend. \n\nIf that is the case, it does beg the question why Mark didn\u2019t tell you of his new romantic relationship, and whether his now ex girlfriend had good reason to be jealous? \n\nJust a blind stab in the dark at trying to see why, but of course you should not continue to let yourself be used by Mark.", "NTA, and what a great example of someone kindly setting boundaries. We need to normalize saying these things to people.", "NTA \n\nAt all. He's an adult. Why sugar-coating shit? That way he learns that friendships are not a juke box where you only put in a dime when you want something.", "NTA- boundaries need to be clearly explained for them to succeed and you did it perfectly.", "NTA if he wants an on call therapist he can pay for one", "This was so kindly worded, and it really touched me. Thank you for your thoughtful words, really.", "Wow - \u201cnurture the things you want to be able to rely on\u201d is great, solid advice that I\u2019ll take myself, and pass around when needed. Thank you so much for sharing that piece of wisdom!", "To be fair, I think he (the friend who thinks I might be the AH) was more concerned about the \u201cwhen\u201d of my words rather than the \u201cwhat\u201d. As in: why would you kick someone when they\u2019re down, rather than just avoid them and then say your piece at a less delicate moment? It\u2019s worth noting that our culture (I\u2019m not American) is non-confrontational to a fault (in my opinion) and beating around the bush is something of a national sport, so his advice is not that far-fetched, in context. The \u201cwhen\u201d I said it makes me more worried about being the AH than what I said, tbh. I\u2019m just not sure it could be helped; like I said, I don\u2019t really see how avoiding him until he is feeling better would have been feasible (or respectful, for that matter).", "Friends mutually supporting each other is great, whereas therapists, ie one-sided support, get paid.

I hope you have a life full of wonderful, caring friends, like yourself!", "NTA I had a friend like that, would always call me for support when a relationship didn\u2019t work out but would disappear if I ever needed anything, it was exhausting. I eventually cut them out of my life and it was the right decision", "It can get so OLD( older than even me:) when you are a caring friend and are only useful when someone has had times. It almost makes you not to reach out any longer. Someone like OP seems like they genuinely deserve a really good group of friends!", "The fact that he didn\u2019t even reply is all you need to know.

If he cared about your friendship, he would have apologized and asked you what he could do to make it better\u2014not run and complain to someone else.", "Yeah NTA\nYou are nice and brave for actually being honest and telling him the truth. I bet most ppl would just do what your friend said or ghost Mark, cause its easier.\nBut this way you both get closure. At least he'll know not to do this to another friend (hopefully)", "NTA. \n\nMark got the truth, and you were also polite in your delivery.\n\nWhy should you have to cushion this for him, you already spent a significant amount of time being his soft place to land - and he showed how selfish he was.\n\nWhy would you waste time sugar coating the truth for someone like that\u2026?", "NTA. \n\nYou handled that very kindly.

The \"you should have worded it better\" smacks of gender vibes tbh.", "NTA\n\nThe friendship revolves around him and his issues, he does not seem to be interested in you or your life apart from when it benefits him.\n\nLying to him will not help him improve his ways. You did the correct thing.", "NTA, I mean what did he expect? He already told you that he was investing a lot of energy in his new friend group and would not have a reciprocal relationship with you. Like he's straight up said that he had emotional energy, but he was giving it to other people. \n\nI also think you should stop being friends with this person who's telling you that you're a villain for being honest. You were an adult. Why would you lie to someone when you can tell them the truth and they can then have the opportunity to treat other people in their life better? It sounds like he wants to give Mark all his attention, he can go and do so.", "NTA.  He doesn\u2019t want a friend, he wants a free therapist.  It\u2019s best to not use people as you need then and call that friendship esp if you aren\u2019t going to be there for them when you\u2019re okay.  That\u2019s essentially what he did to you.", "NTA. OP, you handled it kindly. Sometimes people do this stuff (blow off a friend when life is doing well, then want them to be there for them when life is bad), but there are consequences to that, and these are them. You were there for Mark when he needed you. He was not there for you. Now he expects you to be there for him again.\n\nToo bad.", "Hi! Thanks for taking the time to look at possible different sides of the situation, I really appreciate it. However, I don\u2019t think this is the case - our relationship was always strictly platonic, for one. Also, by the time I decided to take a step back (so when he was essentially not communicating anymore), he wasn\u2019t even dating anyone seriously, just going on the odd tinder date, so there was no one that could misunderstand our friendship and make any demands of that sort. I think the situationship that caused his current low feelings started after we were barely speaking, because his messages on Friday were the first I heard about it, so it wouldn\u2019t have made sense for her to demand that he stop speaking to someone he already didn\u2019t speak to.", "Also want to point out that lying to him (which 'sorry too busy' would be) isn't helpful to anyone either. I know there's a big cultural push towards ghosting because nobody is owed an explanation, etc, but at the same time, your being *willing* to step up and say it is more likely to help him change that behavior for the next time with someone.\n\nGhosting is exhausting and doesn't lead to resolution for anyone. You didn't *have* to give an explanation - but doing so is healthier in the way you did it (without anger, insults, etc) than just 'oh too bad, sucks to be you, oh well'.", "NTA. Apparently Mark mistakenly thinks you are his therapist. Tell him to get an actual therapist. It sucks that he is \"sad\" but you do get to set that very reasonable boundary.", "NTA.", "Look at it this way. His reliance on your sympathy and support which was one way, may have something to do with his relationship issues.  Telling him the truth may provide needed insight that will maki his next relationship work out.", "NTA.  You're an adult and used your words.", "NTA. I have had the same situation with a friend. Shes the type that always needs a romantic relationship or she\u2019s unhappy. Whenever she broke up with someone she would call crying and since she\u2019s my high school best friend I was there for her. Call daily to check in, went to things her ex was supposed to. On her birthday I even took her out paid for her drinks since she didn\u2019t have much money. Expensive as fuck btw. She didn\u2019t seem that grateful either. Then she gets a new man and I don\u2019t exist. I\u2019m whatever about it cuz I\u2019m married and happy, but the cycle repeats.\n\nThen one time I called crying because I needed a friend and was going through something. Not to long later she said she had to go. All good, ppl are busy, but she never called me back. Texted me a few times after but that was it. It was really painful. It hurt realizing I wouldn\u2019t get the same friendship in my time of need as I gave her. I really cared for her as my friend. Not sure how close you guys were but if you felt the same pain I\u2019m sorry you had a shitty friend OP. Truly. \n\nJust wanted to let you know that I\u2019m proud of you for standing your ground. You have inspired me to do the same next time she breaks up lol. You\u2019re awesome and NTA.", "NTA. The friend who told you to lie is wrong. You handled this perfectly. Maybe Mark will be less selfish in relationships going forward.", "NTA - and further, I'm so glad you gave him a reason. I've been ghosted by a few extremely close friends. I will never know what I did wrong. If I had messed something up, or if they had simply decided they wanted to hang with other people. Getting a message like you sent would sting, but I'd at least KNOW. And it's better to know than just delay and delay until you ghost.  \nIt sucks for him to hear, but you aren't the asshole. Sometimes telling someone the truth will make them sad, but that doesn't automatically make you an asshole.", "NTA, he made you his therapist and you're right to set boundaries to end that.", "NTA. An eye opening conversation that lets you truly improve your life and relationships doesn\u2019t add to troubles. It\u2019s only trouble to Mark if he can\u2019t continue it use you", "NTA. \n\nMark was being a selfish jerk and you told him why you can't be his go to emotional crutch whenever it suits him. Why should you lie?", "NTA I had a \u201cfriend\u201d like that myself recently. It was so deep that she was giving me things like best friends forever heart wall hangings and stuff. Then for no real reason that I can figure other then I couldn\u2019t talk to her about a problem she was having because I was actually in the process of getting ready for surgery(the doctor appointments and all that stuff beforehand) so I just had too much on my plate. She suddenly unfriended me on fb and doesn\u2019t respond to texts or messages. But that\u2019s ok I\u2019ve moved past it and am happy with my life and just hanging out with family. But some people", "NTA If you don't keep up friendships, you don't get to rely on them for the benefits they provide. There are friendships that are periodic and there are friendships that are so deep that 10 years can pass and you can pick up right where you left off. This isn't one of those. He showed you that you had no place in his life when he wanted to concentrate on things he saw as better and now he wants back in for you to do the emotional labor for him. Screw that.", "NTA find a real friend.", "NTA\n\nHe couldn't be bothered to be there for you when you needed him, he's happy to drop you almost completely when things are going well for him. Only popping back into your life when things take a turn for the worse and he needs your emotional support again. That friendship is always going to be one sided. You are right to walk away.", "Nta.

You handled this with integrity. You told a difficult truth with kindness.", "I have a friend like this. Pre-pandemic I invited him to a NYE party. I was hosting so was, you know, busy. \n\nHe pulls up and as soon as I open the door, he motions for me to come out and has a 20-minute monologue/litany about some issue he has with another friend of his who has demonstrated emotional and mental instability with violent outbursts several times. He goes on and on and I was like \"yep she's unstable, distance is appropriate after that behavior. Anyhow I have to get back inside to host the 15 other guests\" and he was like \"oh I guess the conversation is all about YOUR problems now.\" I just shook my head and went back inside.", "the friend who texted you about Mark being upset, Should be the one to talk to Mark then. \n\nYou have your own life now.

You dont owe shit to anyone.", "Hey, I'm so sorry your friend treated you so poorly. Even if you hadn't been so supportive of her in the past (repeatedly), which you were... it's just not right to leave someone crying on the other end of a phone call and not call back. No one deserves to have their distress treated so carelessly, least of all a friend. You sound like someone who surely has other people in your life who will be more responsible stewards of your feelings during tough times, and those are the ones you should be directing your kindness to, not this so-called friend.\n\nThank you for your kind words and for sharing your experience; it's really helpful to hear about others' similar interactions and see the issue from an outsider's lens. I appreciate you!", "Also, the friend telling you to lie to Mark...that's *terrible* advice.\n\nThat person may think they're giving you advice that protects you and asks the least of you, but the implicit suggestion they're *actually making* is \"Hey, you need to keep doing emotional labour on behalf of Mark's feelings because homeboy is *still* going through it, even though it's been demonstrated Mark does not give a shit about moving water for you.

And at this point, we are only facebook friends so I only see his frequent posts. Maybe he reciprocates to the friends of his that also have problems, but all I see are his downer posts so I can't be sure. It is not a sustainable way to have a friendship when one person is needier than a newborn.", "It's very selfish, and that's the problem.
