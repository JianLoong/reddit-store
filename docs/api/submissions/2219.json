You gave him your attention and offered what you always felt was genuine care and advice. He \u201cgot good\u201d and decided to put you on the back burner until he had his next set of problems he needed advice with? The relationship is one sided. Hold your ground. You deserve quality friendships. Every good friend does.", "NTA. You were straightfoward and polite. Why would it be better to lie? I never get when people say that. He made his choices so he can now deal with it. It\u2019s not \u201cadding to his troubles\u201d if he was the one who distanced himself as soon as he got new friends and is now looking to have a free therapist.", "NTA - i wish more people were as mature as you.", "NTA - you were straightforward and polite. I don't understand why people think you need to lie about telling someone how you feel. Like it is okay to just lie and beat around the bush? That just causes bigger issues down the road. Sure in general someone can be straightforward and come off as an AH about it but you didn't. You were polite about the situation. That is how you handle those situations. \n\nHis feelings are not your responsibility and he put himself in this situation. Yes sometimes you need that support from your friends, but he didn't support you. The friendship was one sided. What he just expects for you to drop what you're doing to be his emotional crutch, when he couldn't bother to be there for you? Let alone reply 4 days later to you when you needed his support?\n\nYou handled it like a champ.", "NTA. He hurt you emotionally and you had to put down a boundary. It sucks, but you are responsible for your own well-being.", "NTA. So NTA. That was a clean decisive cut of honesty. Mark is what I grew up to refer to as \u201ca fair weather friend\u201d and \u201cpsychic vampire\u201d. They take\u2026 and take and take. If Mark needs therapy he can go see a counsellor. You don\u2019t have to engage in such a one-sided relationship.", "NTA.  Your response was way more mature than lying, or really, any other response.  This person is not your friend, just looking for free therapy.  I made a move similar to yours some years ago and left behind a super-close friend group.  The 2 closest of these people are no longer friends for similar reasons.  Long-distance, even in platonic relationships, is often a deal-breaker.", "NTA. Mark sounds incredibly self-absorbed and is treating you like his personal on-call therapist. You're having to do all the heavy lifting and emotional labor, while he has proven to you multiple times that he will not reciprocate and has no interest in what's going on in *your life* whatsoever. You were straight forward and honest with him, and you don't owe him anything more beyond that.", "NTA\n\nMark is very selfish. He only wants to take from this relationship and not put in the effort. You were up front with him after he stopped talking to you for MONTHS.\n\nBesides, I hear he has this super intense group of friends. I'm sure one of them will be there for him...", "NTA.", "NTA and you sound like an excellent communicator. You were kind, fair, and finally, protective of your energy when a clear pattern emerged. Good on you!! Mark needs to learn that he needs to nurture his relationships if he wants to be able to rely on them. Hoping your knack for directness while still being kind and fair rubs off on me.", "NTA I think your response was mature and respectful. I wish more people would be open and honest about were friendships stood. But then again I have sent a \u201cbreakup\u201d text to a friend before so maybe I am biased.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You explained kindly why you could not put in more effort after already warning him you were feeling that way. Good for you for sticking up for yourself in a polite and healthy way", "NTA and your post is making me deeply wish I had done this with a friend sooner. It hurts when close, longtime friendships end but you deserve to be around people who prioritize you just as you do them, and Mark is missing out. That is no fault but his own.", "I don't see how lying could help him, it just kicks the problem down the road. You're being mature and it's good for him to hear the truth so that maybe he can mature as well.", "NTA. If you had of lied and kept on lying, you would have been the ahole. Your response was perfect and although he's upset now, Mark will be better off for it."]}
