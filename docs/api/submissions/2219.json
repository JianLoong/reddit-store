I was particularly close to one of these friends, Mark (33M). Mark went through the wringer in 2021; he had job and family issues, and his long-term girlfriend broke up with him unexpectedly. Although I had already moved when it all went down, I was as supportive as humanly possible from a distance: prioritized answering his texts and calls, constantly checked on him etc. I'm not saying this to get any credit, since it's pretty basic stuff, just to illustrate how close our friendship was. Since earlier this year, Mark has turned a new leaf: new job, friends and hobbies, and he's feeling the best he's felt in a long time, which is great and well-deserved.\n\nHowever, once he started this new chapter, he became very distant. He gradually stopped replying to texts; if he replied at all, it would be days later and only because he had something he wanted to talk about. Replies were short or just emojis. I cut him some slack for a long time because I understand that new things require a lot of energy, but it never improved. On the one occasion where I was in a pickle and looking for his input, he replied 4 days later with thoughtless \"advice\" (\"tell your boss to fuck off\") and moved on to something he wanted to discuss. I let him know then that our friendship was feeling increasingly one-sided. He was apologetic and explained that his new group of friends was super intense, with a busy social life, but he would try to do better. Nothing changed, so I accepted that we had grown apart. I will always cherish the friendship we had, but it didn't make sense to continue pushing things and I stopped engaging. As expected, once I quit making all the effort, we barely spoke for months.\n\nCue this Friday, when I woke up to a million texts from him. Apparently he was in a romantic situationship that didn't work out and feeling very down. I replied with \"sorry you are feeling this way, it sounds rough, hope you feel better soon\". He sent more texts about his feelings and asked if we could have a call that evening. I said I had plans and he asked when we could talk, because he really wanted to know how I've been and misses me. I decided to be honest and replied: \"Mark, I've been choosing to spend my time and energy in relationships where the emotional labor is move evenly distributed. I wish you the best, but I'm not able to provide the support you're looking for.\" He didn't reply.\n\nThe next day, one of our friends told me that Mark was very sad about what I said. He doesn't think I owe Mark my attention, but believes I should've just lied and said I was busy instead of adding to his troubles. I don't see how that's feasible (\"hey, I'm too busy, forever\"), but I do see his general point.

You gave him your attention and offered what you always felt was genuine care and advice. He \u201cgot good\u201d and decided to put you on the back burner until he had his next set of problems he needed advice with? The relationship is one sided. Hold your ground. You deserve quality friendships. Every good friend does.", "NTA. You were straightfoward and polite. Why would it be better to lie? I never get when people say that. He made his choices so he can now deal with it. It\u2019s not \u201cadding to his troubles\u201d if he was the one who distanced himself as soon as he got new friends and is now looking to have a free therapist.", "NTA - i wish more people were as mature as you.", "NTA - you were straightforward and polite. I don't understand why people think you need to lie about telling someone how you feel. Like it is okay to just lie and beat around the bush? That just causes bigger issues down the road. Sure in general someone can be straightforward and come off as an AH about it but you didn't. You were polite about the situation. That is how you handle those situations. \n\nHis feelings are not your responsibility and he put himself in this situation. Yes sometimes you need that support from your friends, but he didn't support you. The friendship was one sided. What he just expects for you to drop what you're doing to be his emotional crutch, when he couldn't bother to be there for you? Let alone reply 4 days later to you when you needed his support?\n\nYou handled it like a champ.", "NTA. He hurt you emotionally and you had to put down a boundary. It sucks, but you are responsible for your own well-being.", "NTA. So NTA. That was a clean decisive cut of honesty. Mark is what I grew up to refer to as \u201ca fair weather friend\u201d and \u201cpsychic vampire\u201d. They take\u2026 and take and take. If Mark needs therapy he can go see a counsellor. You don\u2019t have to engage in such a one-sided relationship.", "NTA.  Your response was way more mature than lying, or really, any other response.  This person is not your friend, just looking for free therapy.  I made a move similar to yours some years ago and left behind a super-close friend group.  The 2 closest of these people are no longer friends for similar reasons.  Long-distance, even in platonic relationships, is often a deal-breaker.", "NTA. Mark sounds incredibly self-absorbed and is treating you like his personal on-call therapist. You're having to do all the heavy lifting and emotional labor, while he has proven to you multiple times that he will not reciprocate and has no interest in what's going on in *your life* whatsoever. You were straight forward and honest with him, and you don't owe him anything more beyond that.", "NTA\n\nMark is very selfish. He only wants to take from this relationship and not put in the effort. You were up front with him after he stopped talking to you for MONTHS.\n\nBesides, I hear he has this super intense group of friends. I'm sure one of them will be there for him...", "NTA.", "NTA and you sound like an excellent communicator. You were kind, fair, and finally, protective of your energy when a clear pattern emerged. Good on you!! Mark needs to learn that he needs to nurture his relationships if he wants to be able to rely on them. Hoping your knack for directness while still being kind and fair rubs off on me.", "NTA I think your response was mature and respectful. I wish more people would be open and honest about were friendships stood. But then again I have sent a \u201cbreakup\u201d text to a friend before so maybe I am biased.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You explained kindly why you could not put in more effort after already warning him you were feeling that way. Good for you for sticking up for yourself in a polite and healthy way", "NTA and your post is making me deeply wish I had done this with a friend sooner. It hurts when close, longtime friendships end but you deserve to be around people who prioritize you just as you do them, and Mark is missing out. That is no fault but his own.", "I don't see how lying could help him, it just kicks the problem down the road. You're being mature and it's good for him to hear the truth so that maybe he can mature as well.", "NTA. If you had of lied and kept on lying, you would have been the ahole. Your response was perfect and although he's upset now, Mark will be better off for it.", "NTA for sure and ur friend sounds hella immature lol surely he didn't learn about common sense?", "NTA at all. Hopefully losing your closeness helps him become a better friend to others in the future. Also, keep your integrity and don't lie. I think the other friend who told you to shouldn't be trusted, if they encourage lying.", "Nta i mean good for you if you do not stand for yourself no ones gonna do it .", "Nta, of course\n\nBut it did occur to me that you\u2019re a woman and Mark is a man who dates women. Perhaps when he got a new girlfriend, she was uncomfortable with him keeping a close friendship with you. Instead of standing up to her and defending your friendship, or doing the minimally decent thing of explaining the situation to you, he simply stopped being your friend. \n\nIf that is the case, it does beg the question why Mark didn\u2019t tell you of his new romantic relationship, and whether his now ex girlfriend had good reason to be jealous? \n\nJust a blind stab in the dark at trying to see why, but of course you should not continue to let yourself be used by Mark.", "NTA, and what a great example of someone kindly setting boundaries. We need to normalize saying these things to people.", "NTA \n\nAt all. He's an adult. Why sugar-coating shit? That way he learns that friendships are not a juke box where you only put in a dime when you want something.", "NTA- boundaries need to be clearly explained for them to succeed and you did it perfectly.", "NTA if he wants an on call therapist he can pay for one", "This was so kindly worded, and it really touched me. Thank you for your thoughtful words, really.", "Wow - \u201cnurture the things you want to be able to rely on\u201d is great, solid advice that I\u2019ll take myself, and pass around when needed. Thank you so much for sharing that piece of wisdom!", "To be fair, I think he (the friend who thinks I might be the AH) was more concerned about the \u201cwhen\u201d of my words rather than the \u201cwhat\u201d. As in: why would you kick someone when they\u2019re down, rather than just avoid them and then say your piece at a less delicate moment? It\u2019s worth noting that our culture (I\u2019m not American) is non-confrontational to a fault (in my opinion) and beating around the bush is something of a national sport, so his advice is not that far-fetched, in context. The \u201cwhen\u201d I said it makes me more worried about being the AH than what I said, tbh. I\u2019m just not sure it could be helped; like I said, I don\u2019t really see how avoiding him until he is feeling better would have been feasible (or respectful, for that matter).", "Friends mutually supporting each other is great, whereas therapists, ie one-sided support, get paid.  You did nothing wrong being direct with your ex friend.", "I\u2019m so glad it was helpful! \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. Long time ago, I had a friend like this. I wish I had your tact and wisdom in handling this situation. I can say for sure he was not really your friend, but someone just sucking up your good feelings and energy.", "There's a good chance that his \"situationship\" failed for the same one-sided reason.  Your simple, honest reply was something he already needed to hear from you, and if he views his current situation through that same lens that you offered via your reply, he will probably learn what he needs to know about his latest breakup, too.\n\nETA: NTA", "NTA. Mark deserves his hurt feelings, considering he's reaping what he sows.", "NTA\n\nMaybe he didn't mean it but he used you as an emotional dumpster and threw you away until he need a dumpster again.\n\nYou did the right thing by not lying, he can learn from his mistakes.", "NTA, He didn\u2019t do basic relationship maintenance, you are going to invest time and energy where it benefits you.", "NTA. You put that beautifully.", "Nta, you tried to keep the friendship, he didnt. Now he's realizing that friendships, just like relationships, take work.", "NTA you sound like a great friend while also being great at setting boundaries for yourself. Don't worry about Mark and keep it up.", "NTA people have to face the truth ,he failed as a friend and you couldn\u2019t pretend anymore that\u2019s it!! If your mutual friend like to pretend it\u2019s his problem (btw you should be careful knowing that)but you choose to be gone and it\u2019s a very good approach !", "This is so well put!", "\"his personal on-call therapist\"\n\nThat's exactly how he was treating OP. Good for OP on not only setting the boundary but also explaining why, put that energy into others who will pour from thier cups like you would.", "Appreciate your kind words. I hope you have a life full of wonderful, caring friends, like yourself!", "NTA I had a friend like that, would always call me for support when a relationship didn\u2019t work out but would disappear if I ever needed anything, it was exhausting. I eventually cut them out of my life and it was the right decision", "It can get so OLD( older than even me:) when you are a caring friend and are only useful when someone has had times. It almost makes you not to reach out any longer. Someone like OP seems like they genuinely deserve a really good group of friends!"]}
