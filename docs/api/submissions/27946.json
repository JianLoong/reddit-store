She had an affair with some dude, got pregnant and left. What made it even worse was that her affair baby was a boy and I\u2019m a girl. She never wanted a girl. While she wasn\u2019t a terrible mom to me when she was around, I\u2019m not surprised she left the second she found out she was having a boy. \n\nAnyways, this baby is 18 now. \u201cMax\u201d and I never knew each other. I saw him as a baby a couple times but my mom stopped trying to see me after a while so I knew nothing about him. \n\nWell, my mom contacted me out of the blue the other day saying that Max is gone. Like he left and she can\u2019t reach him. I was concerned for a bit but then I realized he requested me on instagram some time before so I checked his social media and he had very recent activity (I\u2019m talking like posted 10 mins ago) and he seemed fine. If I had to guess I\u2019d say he\u2019s with a friend atm as he\u2019s always posting on his story with his friend. \n\nI told her that he\u2019s probably fine but she wouldn\u2019t let it go and showed up at my dad\u2019s house. My dad\u2019s really unwell and his wife is visiting her family so he called me to help him out and when I got there my mom was in tears saying that Max has mental illnesses and PTSD, OCD, bipolar whatever. Apparently he doesn\u2019t take his meds either. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m just a horrible person but idk why she thinks any of that is our concern and secondly I just don\u2019t believe her. I know it\u2019s highly ignorant to say that Max doesn\u2019t seem to be mentally ill to the extent she\u2019s claiming and I know its even worse to assume he\u2019s fine based on social media. \n\nBut I just can\u2019t believe her. She has a history of lying to me to get pity/sympathy too. \n\nAnyways, she started yelling at my dad and called him horrible things just because he told her that she should be asking Max\u2019s father for help so obviously I cut in and told her that if she didn\u2019t leave I\u2019d call the police. She called me heartless and begged me to believe her but I sort of brushed her off and said that she\u2019s literally the last person I\u2019d trust and I\u2019m not surprised Max ran off. She called me terrible, started crying even more and said she\u2019d send me proof (I\u2019ve yet to see this proof btw). \n\nI don\u2019t really feel bad but it\u2019s weird seeing my mom so upset. She\u2019s usually very put together which makes me wonder if she\u2019s telling the truth but regardless I don\u2019t really care. But AITA for how I behaved?

You're not Max's parent, your egg donor isn't much of a mother to you. Basically this weird woman came to a strangers' house to ask for help because her child run as soon as he turned 18?\n\nYou could talk to him since he's reached out to you first, so probably would be ok with more contact, but you have zero obligation to tell anything to your mother. Besides, if she doesn't know her son's social accounts, that's probably also for a good reason (and if she does, she actually knows he's ok).", "nta and this is a really common but scary tactic abusers use when their victim tries to leave- especially if they *do* have any mental illness, which was likely caused and/or exacerbated by the abuse to begin with.", "NTA , protect your real family (your father) every single time. Her emotional response was meant to manipulate you. Nope.

Why would your dad care?  You might slightly care since he's a half-sib but even then, if you never were raised together, you don't know him.\n\nMy hubby has a half-bro that's six years younger and hubby lived with grandparents, so this guy doesn't feel like a brother.  We've cut him off since he's a druggie, was arrested over 20 times for various things, was in jail at least 4 times, etc.  I wouldn't care if he was missing, he's not related, in my brain.  You're NTA.", "NTA, but maybe send Max a DM and check-in, just to make sure he's okay.", "NTA  Your mother pretty much abandoned you for most of your life.  Showing up to your sick father's house wanting help is ludicrous.  What does she expect you to do?  If her son left and does not want his mother to know where he is he probably has good reason.  It is not yours or father's responsibility to find her son.  She was way out of line even showing up at your dad's house.  You and your father have done nothing wrong.  You are not the terrible heartless person, she is.  She is a toxic person and you do not need people like that in your lives.  Your dad was right, she should be talking to the son's father.", "NTA", "NTA, she abandoned u, you don\u2019t owe her anything.", "NTA - you don\u2019t know the guy. Why is she coming to you?", "NTA. Your mother is.  \n\n\nSay \"NO\" and continue to say no. Do not allow Max in anywhere, Have zero contact, block him on all social media. This is their plan to guilt you in.
