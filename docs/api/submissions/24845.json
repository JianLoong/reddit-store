My uncle hooked me up with this awesome gig as his assistant since I am waiting for my results and it pays pretty well.

Things were going well since I was saving money on the side for college.(In my country it\u2019s not that expensive but I dont want to be a burden). Since I dont have a bank account, I keep it hidden in my room. One day when I came back from work and I saw the box I hid the money in with my mom. I told her to return the money and box to me and she said I was being greedy and didn\u2019t care about them. She then said she would take half as rent. I explained it was savings for college but she said I already had a job and shouldn\u2019t bother about it. I could go later and I should be patient. I got angry and snatched my money from her. She called my dad and he agreed with her. I felt bad so I told them I would give them around 25% and I apologized for snatching the money. After all, she\u2019s my mom. They said I was a stubborn son and they wanted all of it. They said if I didn\u2019t agree, I could leave. So I left. Right now I am living with my uncle.
