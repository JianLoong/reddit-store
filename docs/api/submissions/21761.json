The both of us have been dreading this moment for a very long time due to us knowing how opposite our parents are. This past Saturday was finally the day for them to meet, as my parents wanted to host them at their home, where the 7 of us, including my sister, would have dinner, after over a month of planning. The Thursday leading up to the day, my cousin \u201cRyder\u201d, who is also my maid of honor, had texted me asking, \u2018what\u2019s going on this Saturday?\u2019 I replied to her that our parents are meeting for the first time, but wondered how she knew, as I told no one. She proceeds to tell me that her father had asked her if she was going to my parents house for a family bbq. I WAS SHOCKED. My parents had invited my family over to their house and never told us! Queue the My Big Fat Greek Wedding scene.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 tells his parents and they are frantically deciding what to bring last minute. I had also decided that I was gonna get there early and ask my parents why there was no heads up about this event. I get there and my dad is outside so I casually ask him why they didn\u2019t let us know that they invited the family, which seemed like over 50 people. He began to start yelling at me in the garage, from 0-100, gaslighting and said that I had an attitude and that he was the host, it was his house, and he didn\u2019t have to tell me anything. *For context, I come from a toxic cultural background where you \u2018respecting your elders\u2019 and if you have a different opinion, they think you\u2019re talking back, and have the \u2018parent is always right\u2019 mentality. Because of this, most parents in the culture can be blunt and irrational, judge you from head to toe, won\u2019t try to understand where you\u2019re coming from, and gaslight you. I gave him examples on how this plan hypothetically could\u2019ve overwhelmed my in-laws, as they expected only to meet my parents and how he would feel if they were in their shoes. He just kept screaming and saying it didn\u2019t matter. I walked away into the house and he stormed in after me, everyone seeing I was visibly upset and heated, as I had asked my mom again why they didn\u2019t let my fianc\u00e9 and I know about this party. Before I could continue to say my in-laws were aware now and try to defuse the situation, my dad proceeded to cut me off, yelling again. I stormed out of the house in borderline tears. I had called my fianc\u00e9 while he was on the way and told him I wasn\u2019t going back. Ryder came after me, followed by another cousin \u201cHailey\u201d. While bawling, I let Ryder know that I\u2019m not going back to that negative energy and she told Hailey not to follow me and to leave me alone. I told Ryder to apologize to the family for me, but I won\u2019t be disrespected like that.

My fianc\u00e9 was fuming and deescalated the conversation, telling her that he stands by his fianc\u00e9 and future wife and that a conversation needed to happen first with me, and that my parents should be happy that she has a husband that supports and loves her as much as he does. She quickly retracted what she said and told him that\u2019s not what she meant. I was a mess at this point. My fianc\u00e9 and I talked about all the drama that had transpired between phone calls with Hailey and Ryder, including how apparently my mom said she won\u2019t pay for the wedding and my dad saying he won\u2019t go to the wedding at all, all while Hailey continued to text him saying my mother wanted to talk to him. At the same time, my bridesmaid/cousin \u201cNikki\u201d checked in on me and asked if I wanted to meet up with her in a safe space with Ryder to vent, drink, and order food, which I agreed and went to take my mind off things and explain my side of the story, since no one was present during my fight with my dad. He had most likely told my family that I was the problem and that I yelled at him. My fianc\u00e9 asked if I wanted him to talk to my mom, which I said he could as soon as I leave. He said that my mom was adamant on his parents still coming over, which he, for obvious reasons, wasn\u2019t all too comfortable with, especially me not being there. He made the decision to bring them to get things over with, as I waited for updates the rest of the night. When I got home, he was exhausted, but said that everything was fine. Don\u2019t get me wrong, all of this was never about not liking having my family there. I\u2019m grateful that my family was so excited to come and support this introduction of our families joining.

Please know that it is ok to cut off toxicity in any form\u2026family, friends, partners, etc. I was raised in a household where boundaries were not taught and I just learned how to set and uphold boundaries while in my mid thirties. It\u2019s time for you to be strong and protect yourself. Set boundaries and calmly express them to your family, your father in particular. The moment he crosses your boundaries again, which first and foremost should be raising his voice at you as well as showing you that he has no interest in your feelings or point of view, go no-contact. Remember, self love is key in this life. In order to love yourself properly, you have to be willing to protect your peace of mind from ANY source that continuously seeks to break it down.
