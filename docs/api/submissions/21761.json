She quickly retracted what she said and told him that\u2019s not what she meant. I was a mess at this point. My fianc\u00e9 and I talked about all the drama that had transpired between phone calls with Hailey and Ryder, including how apparently my mom said she won\u2019t pay for the wedding and my dad saying he won\u2019t go to the wedding at all, all while Hailey continued to text him saying my mother wanted to talk to him. At the same time, my bridesmaid/cousin \u201cNikki\u201d checked in on me and asked if I wanted to meet up with her in a safe space with Ryder to vent, drink, and order food, which I agreed and went to take my mind off things and explain my side of the story, since no one was present during my fight with my dad. He had most likely told my family that I was the problem and that I yelled at him. My fianc\u00e9 asked if I wanted him to talk to my mom, which I said he could as soon as I leave. He said that my mom was adamant on his parents still coming over, which he, for obvious reasons, wasn\u2019t all too comfortable with, especially me not being there. He made the decision to bring them to get things over with, as I waited for updates the rest of the night. When I got home, he was exhausted, but said that everything was fine. Don\u2019t get me wrong, all of this was never about not liking having my family there. I\u2019m grateful that my family was so excited to come and support this introduction of our families joining.

The moment he crosses your boundaries again, which first and foremost should be raising his voice at you as well as showing you that he has no interest in your feelings or point of view, go no-contact.

No one witnessed the fight with my dad, but some heard yelling. Everyone just knows his POV and not mine and I\u2019m sure I got gaslit.", "Thanks for assuming I\u2019m using my mom for money. I didn\u2019t even want a wedding. I wanted to elope. I didn\u2019t ask them to pay for anything. My mom offered to pay for the reception. She even offered to pay for half my wedding dress after calling me fat in it, which I respectfully declined. My fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents came with my fianc\u00e9 since they don\u2019t drive. They don\u2019t know any details on the fight, just that it happened and I wasn\u2019t going to be there.", "And you still didn\u2019t read that right. I let my dad know that planning a PARTY when it was supposed to be a simple dinner without a heads up could\u2019ve put them in an overwhelming position and it would\u2019ve been nice to know ahead of time. To also think in their shoes. He didn\u2019t see that as an problem because it was \u201chis house\u201d. His parents were just as insistent wanting to meet my parents because they\u2019ve been asking for years and they wanted to go to my parents.", "After ALL THAT he took his parents anyway? WTF? Seriously?", "Why would you let them go into that mess without you?? honestly YTA for that alone", "Maybe it\u2019s time to ask yourselves whether your families are worth having around? Like, how are they adding value to your life? They sound tiresome.", "Wish I could upvote you multiple times. Use my dead spouse\u2019s vote, but I\u2019m not a Republican. Still, take my upvote!", "Neutral ground and you will tell them exactly where 30 min before you are meeting.", "As a survivor of parental abuse, I can safely say that it\u2019s normal to not be able to give clear cut advice to yourself. It\u2019s normal to not recognize that it\u2019s not okay for something to happen or for people to behave a certain way. You grew up in it; it\u2019s your \u201cnormal\u201d. It takes time and sometimes an outside perspective. Don\u2019t be hard on yourself."]}
