Tbh, my parents checked out somewhere around kid #5. I was always able to do pretty much whatever I want. \n\nMy oldest sister (34) had a rough year. She and her fianc\u00e9 broke up and her baby died at 6 weeks old. She decided to move back in and take care of me since my parents travel a lot and it sucks. \n\nMy first class is study hall. My parents used to let me sleep in since it\u2019s not a real class but my sister takes my phone for 2 days if I\u2019m not in the car by 8. She also decided that my clothes were \u201cinappropriate\u201d so she went through my room with trash bags and confiscated everything that she doesn\u2019t like. She put a tracker and parental controls on my phone because she\u2019s mad that I sometimes go out at lunch and she thinks I\u2019m on my phone too much. She also packs me one of those stupid bento lunches every day because she can\u2019t stand that I get lunch from McDonald\u2019s. I also have a bedtime now. What 14 year old has a bedtime?\n\nIt really fucking sucks but I can deal with it. Then 2 weeks ago progress reports came back and she found out I wasn\u2019t doing my homework. She decided that now I\u2019m not allowed to go out after school and she takes my phone the second I walk in and I can\u2019t get it back until she checks my homework. I never get to see my friends anymore so I lied and told her that I was going to stay at school late for tutoring then I turned my phone off so she can\u2019t track me and went out with my friends but she actually went to my school to look for me and when I wasn\u2019t there she drove around until she found me and made me get in the car. It was so embarrassing. \n\nWhen we got home she started to yell at me for being irresponsible and I kinda lost it and told her it\u2019s not my fault her fianc\u00e9 left, she lost her kid, and she quit her job and had to come back here so I don\u2019t know why she has to take it out on me and be such a bitch. She cried and locked herself in her room and she hasn\u2019t come out for like a day and a half. I think I went too far. Was I the asshole for yelling at her because she\u2019s literally ruining my life because hers fell apart", "created_utc": 1682790687, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13326oa/aita_for_telling_my_sister_its_not_my_fault_she/", "score": 4499, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She isn't ruining your life, she's implementing structure and rules and those are things you need to get used to to be a functional adult. You should be thanking her.\n\nEdit for all of those saying that sister isn't OP's parents : the sister might not be OP's parents but clearly her actual parents don't care. The sister can clearly recognise this and see her sister is on a dangerous path and is stepping in. Are her tactics a bit strict? Sure, but it honestly sounds like OP needs it. A loosey goosey parenting style hasn't helped her to date.", "YTA *Oh, the horror*, you have to go to school on time, do your homework, eat healthier food, act responsibly and not spend all your time on your phone. You weren't doing fine, you were doing what you wanted and now you're upset someone is holding you accountable and treating you like a 14 year old.", "So you're upset because your parents checked out and aren't around, but then someone tried to parent you and you're upset?? What do you want here? \n\nShe makes you healthier food, makes sure you don't flunk out of school, tries to take care of you, and you're an ungrateful AH. You're too used to doing whatever you want that you became entitled and just rude. \n\nYes your sister sounds a bit extreme, but it sounds like you need it. YTA", "OMG You\u2019ve been allowed to become independent and unbridled at too young an age to realize the consequences of your immaturity and lack of parents.  No doubt it\u2019s hard to be reigned in when you\u2019re accustomed to doing what you want when you want.  You\u2019re sister is trying to save you from yourself and help you to make good decisions.  Your nasty comments to her were untrue and unnecessary and you said them to hurt her.  That\u2019s why YTA.", "WOW, the responses here.\n\nNAH, except for your parents who created this situation. \n\nYou've been on your own a long time and you're really independent and your sister is clamping you down to what's more appropriate for a 10 to 12-year-old than a 14-year-old, and you've been on your own for so long that even if she clamped down on you appropriately it would probably feel like a tremendous burden given your own experiences. You are experiencing major upheaval and your emotional endurance is used up.  That doesn't make you an asshole, that makes you a young person.\n\nYour sister is *also* going through tremendous upheaval and pain right now.  She couldn't save her own baby or her own situation, but she wants to save you. She wants to be the parent her baby needed and the parents *she* needed and didn't have, and the parents you need, but the reality is she doesn't know, at her age and life experience, how to be a parent to a teenager. \n\nBelieve it or not, you're both on the same team. You both want what's best for you, and for her to heal from what she has been through, but right now everything is super amplified for both of you.  \n\nThe way you lashed out is pretty age-appropriate, but of course she isn't normally the parent of a teenager and she's not your parent and so she's taking this personally and it really hurts. Your kids say things to you that are so hurtful and so on point and it's part of their growing process and it takes everything in you as a parent not to shout back and not to let it cut you to the bone.\n\nI don't have a solution for you, only for you to know that both of you are figuring out your roles, and both of you are learning and growing so fast right now, and I hope you can stay on the same side, The two of you against the world not the two of you against each other.\n\nA good start might be telling her \"I know you want the best for me and I want the best for you. All these changes have been heard from me and I'm used to being independent. I know that you are going through an extremely hard time.  I love you and I'm sorry I lashed out.\"\n\nUltimately what you and your sister need to hash out is what the priorities are, and from there with the expectations of you are. They can't stem from just what she wants but what you both agree would be positive for you. It seems like she's attacked every aspect of your life to try to optimize and it's placing a lot of demands on you.  She's also operating from a place of fear I would bet, given what she's experienced.  As a parent what I want for my kids is for them to eat a moderately healthy diet, fulfill their school obligations, and get enough sleep each night. Usually I can't have all three everyday, but we try, and in the long run the kids are actually doing much better than those three basic priorities appear to describe.  I also try to listen when they're having a hard time with a change I've implemented, for instance is the issue the bento lunches your sister is packing, or is the issue that by not having McDonald's you're being separated from your peer group?  \n\nSend a million mom hugs both you and your sister's way.", "ESH, everyone saying Y T A is completely wrong. Your parents are absolutely atrocious, leaving someone else to parent their child is bad. You\u2019re young so you\u2019re obviously struggling with dealing with yourself and you definitely need to apology but your sister is not right either. She had a death in her life life and she\u2019s clearly trying to prevent another one from happening in an unhealthy way, she needs therapy. Parental controls, going through your stuff and constantly taking away your phone is not going to help, it\u2019s overbearing and she should not be doing it but you do need parenting, less than that but you absolutely do. You need to sit down with her, apologize and explaining that she\u2019s going too far and that you don\u2019t appreciate her taking away your privacy.", "YTA. \n\nThe truth is that you NEED a parent. Your parents aren't parenting so someone has to. You need boundaries, limits and to do your homework. You need to attend study hall (obviously). Your sister is the one stepping up when your parents have failed for 14 years. \n\nNow, she could relax on things like the clothes. You should be able to express your personal style. But you aren't going to get anywhere with that by yelling and throwing a tantrum. You need to come to her with a plan on how you are going to get your grades up and how you can earn back some freedoms. Included in that can be that you want to have a certain style.", "ESH - but you're 14 so I don't expect you to have the experiential understanding of the magnitude of loss your sister has undergone. She's trying to control something she knows she can control after these things that happened to her that she had no control over. She's absolutely gone way overboard in some areas, for sure. But in others, these are parental standards if they're trying to be good parents. In your case it feels like too much because your parents are very inattentive & absent even. \n\nI'd apologize for hurting her. Let her know you're used to how your life was before & ask her to only flex her parental muscle on the most important stuff because she's just destroying a relationship with you. Let her know you value how much she cares about you & that she's stepped up for you so much, but to at least have a conversation with you like a normal person/ big sister before throwing down the gauntlet for every reason.", "What 14 year old has a bedtime?\n\nAll of them. No really. I'm sorry your parents have sucked and been too busy, but your sister has the right of it. One day I hope you will thank her.", "[removed]", "Sounds like you went from having close to zero parental supervision and taking care of yourself to having quite a strict parental figure. If you feel constricted by that it's understandable. However your words were definitely too harsh so for that YTA. \nIt sounds like she was coming from a place of really wanting to \"help\". However her methods definitely sounds like a lot and also not understanding of your situation. Excessive conteolling behaviour is not helpful. (gotta say i definitely had a bed time at 14 and i know mcdonalds is tasty but a healthy lunch is actually a pretty good thing). I think you both need to level and have a talk about how you can work together. Sometimes ppl whos life falls apart try to find smth to control and that's definitely not your fault but lashing out is also not constructive.\nSo yeah, I'd say apologise and have a grown up talk about how you feel and how you can work the situation out together.", "NTA- That\u2019s a lot of change for someone who mostly had autonomy and she overdid it and you snapped. You\u2019re 14. \n\nSo now what? You did cross a line with your comments and probably really crushed her. Apologize. And talk to her. It\u2019s not you vs her. It\u2019s you and her vs the problem. So come up with a plan together. When it\u2019s not working, be honest and revise it. Tell her you want her to support you but in a way that doesn\u2019t take your autonomy and pit y\u2019all against each other. That you want her to guide you like a big sister not like a parent. And that you could come out of this with a really secure connection for you both. \n\nOr it could go the total opposite direction. But this could be wonderful for you both.", "NTA. Why are you doing anything other than laughing at her and her ridiculous attempt to play fake mom? She isn't your parent, she has zero authority over you. \n\nYou don't have to do a damn thing she says. You can feel sympathy for someone without putting up with their abuse. Stop giving her your phone. Remove all trackers and parental controls. Go to bed when you're ready. Live your life the same way you would if she wasn't there. Ignore every crazy demand that flies out of her mouth. \n\nIf your parents get involved tell them to come home and raise their own kid, because you're not going to let your sister pretend like she's your mom, or put up with her taking her frustrations out on you. Under no circumstance should you continue being your sisters doormat. You're 14, not 4.", "ESH let's start with your parents. If they decided to have 7 kids, then it's on them to step up and parent you, instead of letting you do whatever you want. Also most 14 year olds have a bedtime, as being so young getting enough sleep is important. If they can't handle the responsibility of raising all their kids, then they shouldn't have had 7. Birth control exists for a reason.\n\nYour sister is the lesser ah simply because she's grieving and had a lot of shit happen to her in a short span. She needs therapy, not lip from a little brat. Also she needs to get your parents to deal with you, so she can recover and move forward with her life.\n\nYou are an ah for snapping at her. You don't have to like everything, but genuinely she's trying to set you up to succeed in life instead of falling flat on your ass and failing. If you hate it so much, then tell her to have your parents step up. And no its not healthy for a 14 year old to constantly have mcdonalds for lunch. Diabetes isn't fun kiddo, it's not cheap. Neither is increasing your risk of heart problems. Now go apologize to your sister.", "YTA- she\u2019s being a parent to you and implementing rules you very clearly need in your life. Your sister honestly isn\u2019t that strict at all either, you sound like you\u2019re out of control and aren\u2019t paying attention to yourself. McDonald\u2019s for lunch everyday is insanely unhealthy and her giving you food is really kind of her. Half of the clothes are probably really, really short and in all honesty you\u2019re 14 and don\u2019t need to be wearing things that show your body off to the whole world. She\u2019s taking away your phone because you\u2019re tanking your grades by not doing your homework and eventually it\u2019ll guarantee you won\u2019t get anywhere in life if you fuck up in high school. Parental controls are perfectly normal and so is the bedtime, I had one at 14. I get where your coming from, because at 14 you think you\u2019re grown enough to do all this, but you aren\u2019t. You need stable parenting and clearly your sisters doing that. Be grateful.", "YTA. You\u2019re young and you\u2019re at that age where you think everyone is stupid and you know best *and* you\u2019re not used to being told what to do/ having authority figures so your emotions around this make sense. Your sister also isn\u2019t your parent and is doing some controlling things \u2014I think throwing your clothes out is inappropriate\u2014but most of what she\u2019s doing sounds in your best interests. She\u2019s making you healthy food and making sure you do your work. If you are lying and squandering your own education, you are ruining your own life and she is doing the right thing to try to put a stop to it.\n\nYou owe your sister an apology. What you said is horrific. Don\u2019t ever bring up her baby ever again in anything but kindness and empathy.

Noone is 'literally ruining' your life. Yes, her rules seem excessive..but that's basically because you've been getting away with a lot up until this point. Not doing your homework? She's absolutely right to intervene. \n\nYou're angry and that's understandable, but using the loss of her child against her was utterly disgusting. \n\n'What 14 year old has a bedtime?'\n\nLiterally loads.\n\n'She also packs me one of those stupid bento lunches every day because she can\u2019t stand that I get lunch from McDonald\u2019s.'\n\nI cannot believe you're angry because someone is making you a decent lunch.", "NTA\n\nOP is a child going from laissez-faire parents to Stalin running the show. The blowout is  more on  the mother that lost her child and is using her sister as a stand-in for her and her actual parents that are not doing their jobs.\n\nOP is not an emotional support animal nor is she supposed to emotionally manage her sister's feelings.

If she wants to be a kind of guardian to you, she needs to do it another way that makes you both comfortable because she is not your parent.

I don't think her actions are coming from a place of genuine care for you.Even If I'm wrong about that, the way she's trying to help you Will never work.

Tbh, my parents checked out somewhere around kid #5. I was always able to do pretty much whatever I want. \n\nMy oldest sister (34) had a rough year. She and her fianc\u00e9 broke up and her baby died at 6 weeks old. She decided to move back in and take care of me since my parents travel a lot and it sucks. \n\nMy first class is study hall. My parents used to let me sleep in since it\u2019s not a real class but my sister takes my phone for 2 days if I\u2019m not in the car by 8. She also decided that my clothes were \u201cinappropriate\u201d so she went through my room with trash bags and confiscated everything that she doesn\u2019t like. She put a tracker and parental controls on my phone because she\u2019s mad that I sometimes go out at lunch and she thinks I\u2019m on my phone too much. She also packs me one of those stupid bento lunches every day because she can\u2019t stand that I get lunch from McDonald\u2019s. I also have a bedtime now. What 14 year old has a bedtime?\n\nIt really fucking sucks but I can deal with it. Then 2 weeks ago progress reports came back and she found out I wasn\u2019t doing my homework. She decided that now I\u2019m not allowed to go out after school and she takes my phone the second I walk in and I can\u2019t get it back until she checks my homework. I never get to see my friends anymore so I lied and told her that I was going to stay at school late for tutoring then I turned my phone off so she can\u2019t track me and went out with my friends but she actually went to my school to look for me and when I wasn\u2019t there she drove around until she found me and made me get in the car. It was so embarrassing. \n\nWhen we got home she started to yell at me for being irresponsible and I kinda lost it and told her it\u2019s not my fault her fianc\u00e9 left, she lost her kid, and she quit her job and had to come back here so I don\u2019t know why she has to take it out on me and be such a bitch. She cried and locked herself in her room and she hasn\u2019t come out for like a day and a half. I think I went too far. Was I the asshole for yelling at her because she\u2019s literally ruining my life because hers fell apart\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I have the feeling that your parents checked out waaaaay earlier than kid 5, and that she is trying to provide you the parental investment and stability that most (or possibly all) of your did not get.\n\nI suggest that you have a talk with your sister.  You should definitely apologize for your comment, but also let her know that this is a huge change for you.  You may indeed, in some way, be a bit of a \"project\" for her, but consider that it is probably coming from a place of love and concern.  The two of you need to communicate so that her coming into your daily life benefits you both.\n\nYou have an opportunity to have someone there, looking out for you.  And if you don't want those bento lunches, you can send them my way, because those take some work.  Also you aren't in a situation where you're a little kid and the fancy lunch thing is done to impress other parents - she is doing that only for you.\n\nAll the stuff that she is coming down on is super, super basic parenting stuff:  got to class, do homework, limits on roaming around with friends, etc.  You've just never experienced it before.\n\nYTA...but you can communicate with her and fix this.\n\nEdit - spelling", "YTA. Do your homework. \n\nBesides it only feels like your sister is being overbearing because, from the sound of it, you\u2019ve never been actually parented.", "YTA. Your parents were negligent and you seem to all around live a shitty life. She\u2019s trying to help you before it\u2019s too late.", "Wow\u2026. Just wow. YTA. Your parents \u201cchecked out\u201d and your sister is stepping up and by the sounds of it taking great care of you. She is trying to help you build a good future for yourself, she is trying to guide you and set boundaries appropriate for your age. She has been to hell and back, you can not imagine what pain she is dealing with. To accuse her of \u201cruining\u201d your life is ridiculous. In a few years you will look back and be grateful for her care and I hope disgusted in how you\u2019ve spoken to her. You will never be able to take those words back.", "YTA. You are 14. 14yos who become responsible adults have consequences for their actions when they are still children. Do your homework, stop cutting classes, stop being so nasty to her, and follow the rules. It sounds like she really cares about you and loves you. If you do those simple things I doubt you will stay on lockdown.", "ESH. Your comments and behavior are out of line and not okay. However she is not your parent. You, her and your parents need to sit down and figure out what the actual boundaries are. Is she allowed to confiscate clothing that she deems inappropriate(I\u2019m not sure it if actually is), are you allowed to skip study hall per your parents or the school, etc. \n\nAs an aside though, you need to grow up. You are 14, nor 4. If you want to be treated like a grown up then act like it. Take care of your responsibilities like getting to school on time and doing your homework and then you could see your friends.", "NTA\n\nShe isn't your parent, and for her to completely recoke whatever autonomy you had to cope with her own issues is way over the line. I don't understand all these Y T A votes.", "Going against most people here and say that you're NTA. Look, what you said was harsh and you've probably hurt her a lot. Was it too much? Yes. But I do think it came from a point of frustration and panic, about what happened to you all of a sudden.\n\nPeople need to realise that this is a 14 year old, who has learned to live a pretty autonomous life. While her sister means well, this approach is absolutely going to be counterproductive. This is not a 5 year old kid. You can't just walk in, come up with a set of (some pretty extreme) rules that you made up on your own and expect your sister(!) to accept that and change her life around.\n\nThis is first and foremost a parents job and the only AHs to me in this story are them. They should parent the seventh just as wel as the first. If you can't bring that up, don't make seven. But sit down with her and TALK. She's no baby anymore. \n\nThe sister should stay out all together. While she probably means well, she obviously has her own problems right now and she should focus on herself.", "NTA. The fact is she is not your parent, she doesn\u2019t know how to be a parent. She clearly doesn\u2019t know how to be a sister either.

You\u2019re not doing things great, but that\u2019s your decision.", "NTA jesus all these people clutching their pearls.\nWhat you said was shitty, so okay E S H. but she's going too far. you are living your life. it's not the one I would live but you do you.", "NTA she\u2019s taken on her mother role with you, which is 100% not her place.

NTA. You're 14, and a sudden change in everything that you know is obviously gonna be met with some headbutts. Obviously what she's doing isn't helping you nor is the best for you. If she wanted ti step in and parent, she should've slowly transitioned you into her plan instead if shoving it down your throat.", "NTA. Honestly, I'd disappear if someone came into my life like that. Yes, you were harsh, but she pushed you to your breaking point. Hopefully, she gets the message and backs off", "NTA\n\nYou are too old to be parented like this. You have tasted freedom and these is no going back. At 14 you are way past the sort of rules she\u2019s trying to hand out to you. You question her motives and I would have done the same.\n\nBut you do need to grow the fuck up quick. Losing a kid is very painful so you don\u2019t get to deal low blows like that because you know fuck all about being a parent (clearly and sadly for you). An apology is due.", "Maybe work out a compromise.  Your sister is going through some stuff and needs to find a another way to cope with it all.  But the mentality that OP has is not healthy; it\u2019s important to get a job in high school and start good habits so it\u2019ll be easier once you graduate.  You can still have a social life and do well in school, it\u2019s not difficult if you apply yourself and got rid of the \u201cbad boy\u201d mentality.\n\nI don\u2019t recommend doing honors classes, especially with your current work ethic.

YOU'RE 14. Adult you will come to love and appreciate your sisters misguided ways. While Ops sister means well and is doing a good act, the tact's she is using won't actually help OP. Ops sister is coming in way too strong, not listening and attempting to understand you, and is missing the fact that OP is 14 and has opinions.  Op can't be expected to actually respond well or handle this and should attempt to talk to ALL adults in their life about what is happening.", "Please, for the sake of the rest of us, use birth control.", "ESH\n\nOP is TA for skipping class (sorry, study hall counts) and not doing homework and frankly for throwing the sister's deceased child in her face. Also, I'm GenX and even we had bedtimes at 14. It may have been 10:30 or 11:00, but I sure as hell wasn't allowed to stay up as late as I wanted on school nights (and maybe OP wouldn't have to sleep in and miss study hall if she went to bed at a decent time).\n\nSister is TA for throwing out clothes and maybegoing a little further with everything than she  should. OP seems to have been running feral with absentee parents, though, so I get why sister is concerned. The question is whether parents are backing her up on what she's doing.", "ESH, you need to properly reconsider how you\u2019re treating your school work and find a much healthier way of dealing with your emotions. You should\u2019ve talked to your actual parents long before it got to this point. \n\nThose restrictions sound ridiculous for a 14 year old. Your sister is very clearly emotionally struggling and is using you to cope. Which frankly, isn\u2019t fair on anyone. She isn\u2019t your parent. She doesn\u2019t get the authority to treat you like that. \n\nThirdly, your parents are the assholes. Firstly, for leaving a fourteen year old to be raised by their sibling. Secondly, for leaving a fourteen year old in the care of a woman going through severe emotional distress. This wasn\u2019t a surprising outcome.", "I have a feeling the one is getting shut down.

Is maybe her current grief making her overbearing, probably. But it is grief and it's  a mess and nothing is perfect. You finally have some one in  your daily life caring about you, what do you do, how you do it... and yes, you are 14 you haveto do homework. Yes you should have a bedtime, yes you need rules.  She is doing it this because she cares most likely and maybe needs too (again grief).  You need to communicate with her not tell her she's ruining our life because she lost a child. You need some empathy.   \n\n\nThis could be a good situation for both of you.

The consequences she\u2019s giving you are overwhelmingly normal for a teenager, they\u2019re pretty run of the mill for a parental figure. You won\u2019t realize it now but when you\u2019re older hopefully you\u2019ll look back and see how much your sister cares about you\u2026 and also how cruel the things you said to her were. I know at 14 I felt invincible but someday eating crap, having zero work ethic, cultivating shit habits, treating your loved ones poorly and being irresponsible is going to make your adult life (and just older teen life) so much harder. You are lucky to have a sister who wants a better life for you.", "YTA. She isn't doing anything but being a parent since yours are failing miserably. Don't want her to take your phone then do your fucken homework. Want her to trust you then stop fucken lying. If school starts at 8 get your ass up and get to school by 8. Fucken pathetic that you don't have homework done when your first class is study hall. Just FYI just because it's not an actual class you can be held back for missing too much school. Not cute being a 14 yr old dropout. Grow up.", "NTA, your sister is not either, but your parents are.\n\n1. Your parents are responsible for this entire situation. They should be there for you to parent you. Not go on trips when you have to stay alone for multiple days during the week (or likely even more). This is negligence.\n2. Your sister: on the one hand it is healthy that she is implementing some structure for you. this is beneficial for you, you'll understand that later. however, she is taking it too far with the tracker on the phone. it seems to me that she is avoiding her own feelings to process her terrible loss of her baby and her relationship. she needs to face that. it seems she is finally doing that now but please go check on her in her room. make sure she doesn't hurt herself because her trauma is massive. please be kind and understanding.\n3. You are young so that is why I said NTA. your parents are the irresponsible ones putting you and your sister in this position. However, what you said to your sister about her losses was out of line and very hurtful. Even if there is truth to it, please go apologize to her because that was unacceptable to speak to her like that.", "NTA. She\u2019s not your parent.

This is NOT her responsibility and it sounds like she is trying to fix her own sadness at losing a child by being a mom to you.\n\nThat said, what you said to her was harsh. There was a much better way to handle things - such as talk to your parents about what has been going on. It sounds like she really DOES care for you. If she is the oldest and your parents checked out, she may have been parentified to some degree due to your parents neglect and may feel much more of a responsibility than she should.  \n\n\nMostly, your parents are the ones at fault here.

She could probably use it...", "ESH", "A tracker isn't parenting. Could OP use some actual parenting? Probably. But a freaking tracker?!", "I think this is ESH, then Y T A. The older sister is using her younger sister as a cope mechanism for the loss of her child. That is an AH move. The older sister also comes back, disrupts the whole routine, and forces herself into her younger sister life. The older sister could have handled this WAY better by acting like a worrier siblings than a step-parent. OP 100% needs an adult figure in their life as they are just running wild. The OP personality and reaction are because of the absent parents. Honestly, the parents are the biggest AH in the whole situation.", "She never said she's upset about her parents being checked out though. What her sister is doing is counterproductive and pretty extreme.

What about op not having a privacy anymore? What about the fact that the sister didn\u2019t care to play mommy until she lost her own kid?", "OP clearly NEEDS parenting by someone as her parents aren't doing it.  Not doing homework, lying about tutoring, etc. is something that a parent needs to get a handle on and sister is doing it.\n\nI'm sure OP resents it but hopefully she turns around and doesn't impact the rest of her life by doing badly in school and f-ing around.  Being a teenager is hard because you want to do what you want to do and damn the consequences.

You\u2019re too young to see it and frankly your parents being completely shit at parenting is the only reason having someone acting like a good parent is so uncomfortable for you. \n\nYou know your parents checked out. You know they are not being parents. And some part of you knows how different your life is from the other 14 year olds around you. Why it\u2019s easier to find older teens to hang out with. But maybe not how very very bad for you that is.\n\nWhat your sister is doing with you is the minimum a parent would do. Your life is not normal, it is not healthy and your sister is doing her best to unfuck it up for you.\n\nYou are 14 and a brat and behaved like a 14 year old brat who took a very very very low blow at their sister, when your sister is having what is a very reasonable response to your completely unreasonable behavior and currently unreasonable lifestyle. You\u2019re 14, not 18 not 24. There\u2019s a reason you can\u2019t vote or legally sign up for loans or buy alcohol. \n\nYou\u2019re also a kid who was completely failed by their parents so your shitty behavior at this stage falls on them. They are the big assholes, you are the little asshole they have raised so far.

Learning from your mistakes. This is one of those times, you reacted in a bad way and now you feel guilty. That\u2019s normal. \n\nApologize to your sister. Tell her you know she\u2019s doing her best and helping you, even when you don\u2019t like it. \n\nBecause like it or not your sister isn\u2019t ruining your life, she\u2019s likely the only person in your life who hasn\u2019t given up on you. The only person who is trying to make 18year old future you, someone who actually has options for their life rather than someone who has no future, no education and depressingly few options with a mountain to climb to try and make it any better.\n\nAlso General life tip - Do not ever throw someone\u2019s dead child back in their face.

Just lashing out at the sister, hitting below the belt to escape reality and responsibility. \n\nAt 14 you won\u2019t get it but later you will appreciate that help. It would be way easier for the sister to ignore all that and let you be. My parents were too occupied with their careers, never checked what I eat or wear, if my homework was done and couldn\u2019t handle me as a teenager. In my 20s I realized how hard it is to teach myself work ethic and discipline if I didn\u2019t get it from home as a kid-teen. No matter what you want to do in your life, strong work ethic will always get you further than relying on luck or other factors. Skipping classes, no matter how simple those seem, will similarly affect you in long-term. Been there done that. I wish I had an older sister at your age who would dedicate herself that way. Once you are a grown adult, no-one will wait for you to learn those things. You might fail uni, get fired and fail your personal relationships.", "Agree that a teenager needs structure. When looked individually, the rules that sister imposed on OP seem reasonable. However, sister seems to have forgotten that OP came from a no structure life. You don't correct one extreme by swinging hard to the opposite direction, or you could risk a crash (which did happen in this case). You do it by adjusting slowly over time.\n\n\nThis is an ESH situation that could have been prevented by sister sitting down with OP, explaining what's about to happen and why, and implementing the rules - and consequences - two or three over time instead of all at once.\n\n\nI have to add that IMO, the tracker and the clothes restrictions are overkill.  There are bigger fish to fry here/deeper issues at hand.  The fact that sister chose to install the tracker and confiscate OP's clothes just argued further that sister was overcompensating/using OP to deal with her trauma.", "I\u2019m sure op\u2019s has really been around \u2026. Parents had her when op sister was 20\u2026\u2026 so op doesn\u2019t get to come play mommy out of blue. As for op it\u2019s standard teenage unsupervised attitude when so rules are implemented and she used so high end info to destroy her sister", "I'm surprised there isn't more ESH. The sister definitely overstepped in certain areas, and OP overstepped in others. There needs to be a middle ground and mutual understanding. Without it they'll just keep pushing back at each other harder and harder.", "I really hope OP sees this", "Nice comment, but you're also assuming the older sister hasn't been trying that too. OP doesn't exactly sound like a reliable narrator as she consistently downplays her own actions and exaggerates sister's actions in her story.", "Fully agree with this judgement!", "This is the best advice here.", "I agree with you op does need a parent one that actually knows what they are doing and unfortunately for Ops sister that is not her. Ops sister is overcompensating for her lost with op and by doing so she is teaching op a different way to behave a more sneaky way because op has no trust in her sister as the sister has not gained that trust in fact she is pushing op farther away. Going from one extra ( freedom ) to another extreme ( overcompensating ) is not going to do op any good. Op also never said her grades were bad just that she is not doing all the homework. Idk if you remember or are still in school but if you do the bare minimum in homework and actually pass test you come out at a b. What everyone is calling a tantrum it\u2019s op pointing out that her sister is attempting to use her as a replacement child which is harsh but it is what she is doing and she(op) is not her replacement child. So op is not wrong in that sense just harsh. Ops sister lost her child and her fianc\u00e9 left her she is not mentally fit to parent op at the moment. You say op needs to come up with a plan when in actuality all op needs to do is continue going on with how her actual parents see fit. If her actually parents think it\u2019s ok that she sleeps until 8 which isn\u2019t bad since her home room is a freaking free period that\u2019s ok. If you don\u2019t know what happens during free period here\u2019s a hint nothing it\u2019s free. If her sister wants to incorporate lunches in for op to help that\u2019s also fine but it should still be something op can enjoy. Ops sister needs to give back the phone as it is not a phone she purchased. I can understand a phone shut off time. Op needs to call her parents and let them know sister is not a fit parent for op. Their are ways to structure a child that has had to much freedom and their are ways that will further harm this child. The way the sister is going is over controlling and it stems from the fact she has had no control over any of the events that have hurt her in the last year. This is an Esh situation because while the sister means well she\u2019s doing harm still and while op needs a parent sister isn\u2019t fit for that role at the moment", "OP, this is the right answer. Did you do something like an Asshole? Yes. Are you a 14 year old who is going through formative years where input from others is crucial and your patents basically abandoned you? Yes. You are a kid, you are still learning, growing, figuring out the world, on top of family trauma and forms of parental abuse. Your sister came in and found you probably doing a lot of not healthy or safe things. But didnt recongize that it is because of what your parents did and that this is how you survived. You can't take someones life, no matter how bad or good it is, force massive changes on them, and expect them to be happy or adjust well. She is also in a rough spot and this is a situation of everyone in a bad spot and its hard to get out without damage.\n\nEdit: I think the best way for OP to move forward and sit down with her sister to have a real talk about boundries. Tell her that you knows it hard for her and you understand is she trying to help in her own way, but it is not healthy for either of you. She has been gone for a while, you are had to survive and live on your own. Aknowledge your way of life isnt healtht either, buts its what you have done to live with the trauma and abuse from your parents for Abadonening you in a lot of ways. You are a child but because of what you have to do to keep going, you have had to grow up faster and be independent. You would love to have a healtht relationship with her but she needs to respect that you are independent and that by forcing control, it is only causing for suffering and hurting your relationship with her.

I agree is a NAH situation. \n\nI actually had something very similar happen. I was 16 when my brother (20) took over guardianship of me. It was absolutely terrible. I was completely independent at this time and he came in like a hammer. We were both trying to do our best but we didn\u2019t know how to act and be supportive in this new situation. \n\nI would like to say that our relationship got better but it took me moving out at 18 and not speaking to him for almost 2 years before we started to have a relationship with each other. \n\n14f really needs to understand that her sister is actually trying to help her. The problem is that she probably doesn\u2019t even know what healthy support and boundaries look like. Having to fend for yourself for so long changes you. It can make help and love from someone look like a jail sentence. She might also be asking why what she has been doing for years isn\u2019t good enough. She has been doing the best she can and now someone is coming in and saying it\u2019s wrong. (These are a lot of the thought I had when this happened so I might be biased) \n\n34f seems like she is coming down pretty hard. I think it\u2019s hard to understand what level of independence to give someone, especially when the seem to be making poor choices, like skipping homework. I\u2019ve seen this with my own brother. He has kids of him own and his 10yo has more freedom then I did the first 6 months of being at his house. That\u2019s not to say she is wrong with her expectations, doing your homework and having a good lunch is great. It seems like she came into a situation and expected a 180 change to happen and didn\u2019t expect pushback. I think your right, she doesn\u2019t know how to parent a teenager. She might have better luck if she talked to 14f and made the decisions a group discussion instead of a dictatorship. \n\nI know a lot of people here are saying 14f should just listen to her sister but if you are left alone and have to take care of yourself then that approach isn\u2019t going to work. 14f isn\u2019t mature enough to understand how her actions might impact her later but she has learned how to survive the best she can and her sister needs to approach things differently.", "love this answer, very well put", "I would cry from happiness of my older sister made me a bento lunch", ">You're angry and that's understandable, but using the loss of her child against her was utterly disgusting.\n\n100% this.", "Like is it impossible for 14yr olds to have clothes that are inappropriate, do inappropriate clothes not exist and are all clothes just self-expression(even for adults but especially for teenagers).

(Started college at 17). But they never did some of these: \n- Threw out clothing that they deemed inappropriate. I admit, they didn't let me buy some of these things in the first place. But when they did and I bought something they hated, they would set boundaries as to where I could wear the garments (e.g. no skirts over the knee at church). \n- Put trackers on me. And I live in a pretty dangerous country.\n- Gave me a bedtime at 14. I had a curfew though. And that was about 6pm. \n- Took my phone away until I finished my homework. I usually watched movies while I was doing homework and still graduated with a 3.7 or 3.8 GPA (don't remember). \n\nHere are the things you mentioned I was not allowed to do and she's right for putting limits on you:\n- Skip class.\n- Parental controls on phone.\n- Leaving school grounds.\n- Not eating healthy (this one you should be specially grateful for; you need to eat healthy).\n- Not doing my homework. \n- Not telling my parents where I'm going and turning off my phone.", "ESH. OP, you need structure and boundaries, it\u2019s unfortunate that you haven\u2019t had that from your actual parents, but it *will* help you thrive after high school when you\u2019re on your own. The comment to your sister was harsh. She\u2019s going through some things and it\u2019s hard, she\u2019s also parenting you, which you are making more difficult. She\u2019s not without blame. She came in guns blazing so to speak and has completely changed how you operate. Some of those changes are for the better, structure isn\u2019t inherently bad but there are definitely issues with her violating your privacy. \n\n\nFixing Things: You might consider having a conversation with your sister about previous rules or lack thereof and explain that you understand she\u2019s not okay with things but she\u2019s taking it too far, too fast. All she\u2019s doing is damaging your relationship and pushing you to rebel, be sneaky, etc. Strictness doesn\u2019t make good kids, it makes sneaky kids. \n\nAlso, you should check in with your sister. How is *she* doing? Infant loss is a terrible, terrible thing and she is not only grieving the loss of the baby, but the life they might have had. Additionally, she is grieving the loss of a romantic relationship she might have been in for some time AND the future she had planned with that person. She\u2019s going through some shit and she needs therapy. Maybe google some resources and be empathetic to what she\u2019s dealing with. \n\nUltimately, the real assholes are your parents for just checking out on you. I\u2019m sure that sucks in a lot of ways you may not have the words for yet. It feels like freedom but really, it\u2019s that they don\u2019t care and aren\u2019t invested in you as a person. Your sister cares enough to want you to be successful and healthy, even if she\u2019s going a bit overboard. There is a middle ground but you\u2019re going to have to concede a bit, as you should, you\u2019re 14. You need to be parented, it\u2019s not terrible that your sister is willing to do it. Best of luck. Have some empathy, talk to your sister, maybe call your parents out, but definitely find a way to coexist.", "NTA.

It's no skin off her nose if you end up nowhere.\n\nYou, obviously, have no sense of empathy or care. Sure she was bossy but not everything she did was unreasonable, and you could have confronted her better without insulting very sensitive topics. Not turning any any homework and lying about where you'll be are the only justified things she should be angry about (and the clothes depending on what they were). Still, she's overbearing but it may be obvious to her you're not doing well.

She is trying to give you a better chance- take it.", "ESH \n\nIf her sister actually cared, she would have put her foot down a long time ago, but it clearly seems that the loss of her child has affected her sister. And that's why she is clearly going overboard on the maternal frontier.

You hurt your sister, and you should apologize.", "EVERYONE NEEDS THERAPY!\n\nYou deserve control and privacy over your life and it was wrong it was taken away so quickly. You\u2019ve been raised in a way that I don\u2019t think this is AH behavior - I think it\u2019s a trauma response.\n\nYour sister is in a vulnerable position. Your parents failed you both, but you don\u2019t owe her your gratitude for taking away your sense of control in life. If you can have a productive conversation and spell out your needs to her, that would be ideal, but if she\u2019s trying to parent you she has to accept that you are the child in the relationship and it is not your burden to treat her with kindness if it invalidates how you\u2019re feeling. If she wants to be your parent she should meet you where you are and figure out what type of life you want to live. This method is obviously not working and I don\u2019t know why she would continue to do something that pushes you away, but I have a feeling it has to do with the nonexistent parenting in your lives. \n\nWhat she\u2019s doing is not an appropriate way to treat someone who has been through what you\u2019ve been through. But it\u2019s time to decide who you want to be, and how you want to handle the situation. When I was your age, I started reading online about trauma and how it changes people\u2019s behavior. It helped me make sense of myself and others. Many many people are traumatized by things in their upbringing; if you can find the source or even identify those trauma behaviors and responses, you can begin to understand yourself deeper. \n\nDo what you need to do to continue feeling like yourself. I have a feeling your sister is lacking control and connection in her life and is taking that out on you. You can be at odds, but if you take a leap of hope and try to connect with her, you may be able to come up with a plan together, you and her vs all the things that are hurting you both.\n\nYou\u2019re only 14, and I think at that age most of us are products of our environment just learning how to be more than that. The loss of your privacy and freedom probably hurts extra right now. Keep your head up and grow through this, whichever way feels right to you.", "YTA.

You, your sister and your parents all need therapy. \n\nYour parents are the biggest AHs here.\n\nYour sister is taking out all her parenting \"failures\" out on you and is being too extreme.

I did when my daughter died of leukemia.)\n\nI don't think you were a perfect ray of sunshine before she arrived and you did need some structure.

She went through your closet, which is a huge violation of boundaries, changed the entire structure of your life without giving you respect or reasons for doing so, instead of giving you love and support, she's taking things out on you. Has she been through a bunch of horrible things? Yes. She's been through a recent hell. It must be awful for her, but she can't lash out on you all of it. \n\n14 is a time to learn responsibility and independence. You should be practicing making good decisions on your own, and any adult should be guiding you. She should be encouraging you to make good decisions and discussing them with you as an adult, leading by example. \n\nIt's a two-way street. She's the adult, she needs to set the tone of respect. If that's compromised, then comes the punishment; but she's putting the punishment in first and then following it up with more punishment. \n\nAlso, teenagers need more sleep than adults due biological changes within the body, so sleeping in would theoretically improve grades and the ability to focus in class. \n\nHowever, you should be doing your homework (yes, it's torture and essentially useless, but you just suck it up and get it over with) and you shouldn't lie to her or give her an attitude.\n\nEither way, even though I stand by a NTA from this vantage point, because it seems like she crossed some boundaries for no reason other than some mentally not good power-trip, you should apologize for calling her out as you did. This would be a good way to practice being mature and to reinforce your sisterly bond. \n\nBy chance, is she getting help? If she's not, she definitely needs it. I can't imagine losing all that in such a short amount of time. You can't be the one who tells her she needs to seek counseling to deal with this unimaginable level of grief. That probably has to come from your parents or one of her peers. \n\nFinally, all her actions seem to be coming from\na good place, she clearly wants better for you  -- McDonalds is garbage and she probably wants to help your health -- life is rough and competitive and she probably wants to help your grades and get you used to the annoying accountability of the adult workplace -- and as much as what she did to your personal belongings is definitely wrong, she's probably trying to protect you from harassment. \n\nBut how she appears to be going about it -- akin to a new boss swooping in to a company and thinking if they change everything, it will fix everything, but of course breaking the entire system instead because they didn't take a minute to understand it -- wasn't fair to you.\n\nUnfortunately, because of the violations of your boundaries, you had to stand up for yourself, because no one else was doing so. But again, now you have to make peace, tell her you love her, open a dialog, and try to have a peaceful existence with one another. Build each other up. Her life is going to get better, your life is going to get better, and it will get better much sooner if you have one another's backs.\n\n\nAlso, I want to add that it's really not fair to you that your parents \"checked out\" on you and the other younger siblings. Maybe search yourself and see if you have any emotions tied to that fact, other than the freedom it gave. Unfortunately, everyone does need structure, and lacking structure can lead to negativity in life. I'm sorry they checked out on you guys -- that's really not cool. I know 7 kids is a ton, it must be so hard, but still, not cool.", "So your parents stopped parenting at kid #5, your poor sister had to step up to deal with your teenage mess while she's grieving both a relationship and HER DEAD BABY and this is how you handle it?

Hell, you even allow normal expectations to be a little bit more flexible during the transition period!\n\nI know it feels like 14 is running out of time to get on the right path, and maybe it is leaving things late... But a hard and fast \"This is your life now\" doesn't work, and isn't sustainable.\n\nOP: Your sister never had great role models when it comes to parenting, before they checked out, it's pretty likely your own parents treated your older siblings with a lot of control. Your sister is probably also a little jealous at the things you got away with at an age where she likely didn't, I know I was when it came to my younger siblings.\n\nShe is hopefully coming from a good place of not wanting to see her sister waste her life, rather than having a need to control you when her life has none... and even if she isn't, it will help *you* to think that she is! These changes in expectations will be easier to deal with and understand if you assume they are coming from a place of love and good will.", "ESH you are a rebellious kid who never had parents teaching you how to act and she is obviously taking out her trauma on you, but your parents kind of suck more for abandoning you and not setting boundaries for you.

If i could just say one thing to my younger self, it would be to stop trying to fight everyone around me and do what they were telling me to do, which was to implement good habits. \n\nSpecifically, I want to talk to you about homework. Homework really felt so stupid to me, especially because I tested really well and knew the subject material, looking back I believe I felt like I could prove that I was better than all that extra work. At the time I just really didn\u2019t care about it and didn\u2019t want to do it. Even when there were times I tried to get it done it never stuck. But the one thing I\u2019ve learned since then is that there\u2019s a big difference between me now and the kids who put the work in during school. It\u2019s not about whether or not you understand the subject material, it\u2019s about how hard you try. And if you don\u2019t start trying hard now, it will be a lot harder to start trying hard later on. \n\nMy guardian also implemented a very strict bedtime, and very heavy phone and tv/computer restrictions. I know it feels like punishment, but coming from someone who constantly had my phone taken away and my electronics stripped from my room, I definitely can see how it was an effort to keep my mind healthier. You\u2019re so young OP, and because of that your brain is able to break habits much easier than an adult. Your sister seems so harsh right now, but it\u2019s because she can see that you need to break your habits and start focusing. \n\nI\u2019m serious, if you don\u2019t start thinking about how you\u2019re living your life now, you will blink and be in your 20\u2019s filled with regrets. You will have plenty of opportunities to party and do dumb things with your friends, but I promise you you\u2019ll thank yourself when you\u2019re older if you can develop structure now.

When I look back, I wish I was pushed harder to take school seriously, I would have a much better job and wouldn\u2019t have to struggle so much as a 33F with a family who can barely get by without help from family. It\u2019s good to have a social life and friends but don\u2019t let that come in between your future. The friends I had in HS I barely talk to now as an adult, and that\u2019s the way it goes for most people. Your sister is looking out for you, probably because she wishes someone had looked out for her. It\u2019s ok and understandable to be mad at her but also, try to have a little grace for her, she is afraid you will make mistakes that will be hard to overcome later on in life. Being upset with her doesn\u2019t make you TA, you\u2019re having a normal 14 year old reaction to restrictions that you aren\u2019t used to having. The things you said to her make you TA, you should never use someone\u2019s traumas against them. I think you know this because you sound smart and the end of your post implies it whether intentional or not. Maybe do something nice for her and apologize for your words? It might help to have a conversation with her about how you\u2019re feeling with all the restriction all at once. Sometimes it\u2019s easier to talk through email or text, maybe try that?", "YTA. I almost went ESH since I think your sister isn't totally innocent, but I think you're the bigger AH. \n\nHonestly, I think the biggest AH here are your parents. Your parents shouldn't have more kids than they can reasonably take care of--that includes being physically present. \n\nAs for your sister, some of her rules are over the line. But I think part of this is because she's been tasked with raising a teenager. People tend to grow with their children and learn how to give manage their children's growing freedom as it comes. Your sister hasn't had that experience, so she's going to make a lot of mistakes. But she's not taking it out on you. She's doing her job. \n\nHowever, a lot of her rules are not bad. Wanting you to eat a homemade lunch instead of McDonald's everyday? Not bad. Making you actually do your homework? Also not bad. And depending on when your bedtime is, it may or may not be bad. Making sure you get to school on time? Again, not bad. \n\nAnd how is any of this \"ruining your life?\" Making you do work, go to school, and not letting you stay out too late? That's not ruining your life. You're being dramatic. Just because you'd prefer to have no rules doesn't mean the rules themselves are bad. If you want to see your friends, then do your work and don't sneak out. You only got embarrassed because you put yourself in that situation in the first place. \n\nWhat really pushes it over the edge though was brining up her dead baby.

Your life has not been easy and neither has your sisters. It\u2019s hard to do, but the best course of action is to try and muster as much empathy for your sister as you can, and apologize for using her dead child to make a point in an argument. Then, at a time when feelings are cooler, see if you can calmly explain how challenging it is for you to suddenly have all of these new rules and expectations imposed. \n\nThen, try and see if there\u2019s a middle ground where you can meet. Maybe you don\u2019t have a bedtime on weekends or you move the bedtime later. If you have to go to study hall, is that time you can use for homework so it doesn\u2019t take so long after school? Can you eat McDonalds for lunch 2-3x a week? 1x/week? \n\nIt might help to have a third party with you when you negotiate with your sister.

What you said was really cruel to someone who basically just lost their family. Neither you or I know how that feels or how devastating it was for her. I get that you feel totally smothered by her and that she's trying to take on a role in your life that isn't hers to fill, and it's fair for you to feel that way. but what you said to her wasn't it. it was really cold.\n\nwith that out of the way, I get that she's not your mom and it feels really annoying that she's inserting herself like this. I get that homework feels boring and pointless and you wanna hang out with your friends. I get that you don't normally get anything done anyway in study hall and you'd rather sleep in than sit there and stare at the clock. all of that makes sense.\n\nI think what you might not get though, what I know I didn't get at your age, is that adults really don't have things figured out. you don't hit a magical age where suddenly you're totally mature and you just make all the right choices. you have to practice and get good at it. like for me, I started smoking at 16. I didn't know any adults who smoked, so I just assumed that once you hit 25 or 30, you're magically mature and you just stop and it's easy. I'm 31 now and I still haven't quit, because it *never gets easy.* there is no magic mature age. there's just making mistakes, and suffering from the consequences of them, so many times that you get sick of your own BS. and that comes with age. just having screwed up so many times that you're sick of paying for it \n\nwhen she's trying to get you to do this stuff, she's trying to help you figure out how to do some of these things now, so that it's easier for you when you're older. when you're done with school, at some point youre gonna need to be able to hold down a job, and manage your time, and make yourself do something boring even though you'd rather be doing something fun in order to pay the bills. it's gonna be way harder to do that if you don't start practicing now. she knows that and she's trying to help you learn how to do that now, so that you don't struggle so much later.\n\nbelieve me, she loves you and wants the best for you. if she didn't, she wouldn't bother to do all of that. it's not fun chasing people around and arguing with them. people who don't care don't do that. maybe she's not approaching it in the healthiest way, because you're right, she's not your mom. but she does care, so I'd try to be nicer to her if it were me", "I read your comments - YTA \n\nYou just said that it sucks that your parents dont parent.

You flat out admit you skip school, have bad grades, and can do whatever you want and all of it sucks. \n\nWhat you said was beyond cruel and you know that.

The one thing I will say is you somewhat admitted you aren\u2019t doing your homework and it seems like you are blaming the consequences of that on your sister or just aren\u2019t used to having them. Bottom line with that one is, if you do your homework and what she\u2019s asking of you will that make things better as far as being in trouble? I went through a lot of that with my kid around your age with the school and homework. Took his phone, shut the wifi off, etc until he did it and once he did he could do whatever. He would complain anout not being able to do what he wants to do and fight it for hours until eventually giving in and doing something that took him like 20 minutes then he\u2019d kiss my ass and tell me he feels stupid for not just doing it and I\u2019d give him his phone back and turn the wifi back on.

Most of what her sister did was fine and needed however going through and getting rid of her clothes and putting a tracker in her is not fine.

But once I reached around 8th/9th grade my mom told me \u201clook. There are things I\u2019d like you to do, and I hope you do them. But if you choose not to there will be natural consequences that you\u2019re gonna deal with and I don\u2019t wanna hear complaint.\u201d Normally those natural consequences were me feeling tired the next morning or having to hear my mom say she\u2019s disappointed in me.

For teenagers acting out you have to balance between what\u2019s reasonable and what\u2019s not. Restricting her social life a bit would make sense, not making it impossible for her to ever go out.

OP went from largely completely autonomous to having basically zero control over her life and people are surprised she's mad about it because they think that because kids shouldn't have that much freedom they also aren't allowed to react badly to being stripped of it despite the fact that that's an entirely normal reaction that pretty much every person in this thread would have if someone swooped into their life and changed everything about how they lived it.", "But the sister's actions are ineffective because of the way she's gone about them. Having neglectful parents is traumatic in itself, apparently to such a degree that even a 14 year old that has been raised with that as her normal recognized it as inappropriate. Forcing significant changes immediately is counterproductive (and doubling down even more so). OP likely needs someone to listen to them just as much as they need boundaries, and it at least sounds like they don't feel listened to--only dictated to. And OP didn't try to dissemble or lie about what she said to her sister, so it seems likely the story she told is how she genuinely views the situation. OP is absolutely TA for what she said, but her sister needs to recognize that all stick no carrot isn't working and at least have a discussion with OP about why.", "When my brother was acting similar to the OP at 16, my parents pulled him from public school and put him in a private school for kids with behavioral problems and learning disabilities. Prior to this he was on the verge of expulsion. He had been held back in 6th grade when he began rebelling and was labeled the \"bad kid\" by all of his teachers. He ended up getting his shit together and finished his 10th and 11th grade years together at the new school and finishing school with what was his original class. My parents and the school had to put a lot of boundaries in place for this to happen, and he grew a lot from it. He's doing really well now as an adult. Kids need boundaries. They need to be told it is not okay to be out until the wee hours and that it is not okay to skip classes and forego their homework.

Some items are in fact inappropriate for 14 year olds, and it's pretty normal for parents to enforce that to an extent. Short skirts and crop tops are one thing, but kids shouldn't be dressed like they are going to the club. \n\nHaving a tracking app for an unruly 14 year old is not too far. Sure they weren't really necessary when I was 14, but when I was 14 we didn't have super computers in our pockets giving predators unfettered access to us 24/7. 14 is not old enough to just be set free in the world. Late teens, yeah, they should have enough street smarts by then, but this girl isn't even old enough to have realised mcdonalds every day is a bad idea.", "How old are you??

She sleeps through 1st block, cuts other classes, doesn\u2019t eat healthy, doesn\u2019t do homework and presumably is t doing well in school, and yet again BY HER OWN ADMISSION is willing to lie to sneak off with friends. This is ABSOLUTELY the 14 year old that needs parental controls and tracking on her phone. OP is 4 years from adult hood and seems woefully not on track to meet that level of being able to take care of and be responsible by herself. She may not see it yet, but her sister coming back into her life and giving her the structure and guidance that her parents chose not to provide is an amazing gift. I hope one day she matures and can thank her sister for stepping in and caring at such a pivotal role in OP\u2019s life. \n\nAnd OP is absolutely the asshole just for throwing the loss of a child in her sisters face.

This bedtime is a curfew, OP wants to just roam around with her friends and resents having to be home. \n\nOP does not have a strong background of reasonable limits. She's going to resent each and every attempt. It sounds like sister has given her chances and when OP lies to her there are consequences. They are having to build the structure in more extreme conditions that you had more easily and have taken for granted.", "I think in the comments OP made it clear it's a curfew. She just wants to roam around with her friends with no curfew and since she is used to no structure at all, having any limit feels extreme to her. She describes things in extremes which is why she called it a bedtime in her original post.", "Yeah my suggestion in other comments is to let OP win on regards to the clothes but hold fast on the other things that are more important (eg curfew, school performance). Having compromise will probably help.\n\nHowever, just because OP is having a reaction to normal limits doesn't mean it's the wrong approach. It's like when a toddler throws a tantrum because they want to eat McDonald's for lunch every day, you don't just give in. You have to respectfully hold limits.", "You can't blame her after having neglectful parents. She had to do things on her own.", "Many teens do. I was a rare one that didn't.

I don\u2019t blame her for resenting being at home though. She\u2019s #7 out of #7 and I doubt home has been fun for her with her saying her parents checked out two kids ago and aren\u2019t even home most of the time. It\u2019s even less so with her sister showing up and changing her life drastically.

You have to do it but we can work on it together first\" vs \"No phone for not doing your homework\" immediately). Part of adolescence is also learning to have these kinds of discussions and manage conflict, which is difficult to do when all you're given is ultimatums. You and I have the perspective of age to know why these things are important but OP doesn't.

OP is 14 years old and just going to rebel harder and distance herself more from her family. Sister intentions are good tho and OP seems to need some redirection and should be learned to take responsibility. Lessons she\u2019s way more likely to learn from a sister who tries to talk to her and be her friend than from a sister who tries to all of a sudden control her. \n\nHonestly OP, seems like you have it rough.

To clarify, the trauma isn't coming from just losing her baby, it's coming from moving back home, seeing all the ways the family is being dysfunctional, and trying to do something about it because if she doesn't nobody is going to do it... and that requires her to step into a role that isn't meant for her, and in this case, it's noble, not invasive.\n\nThe only alternative is for her to sit back and watch OP self destruct while she feels guilty for not trying to help straighten her life out. It's a lose-lose scenario with a least-worst option, because when an older sibling has to play parent for a younger sibling, it creates a dynamic between the two of them that gets messy in the future after they are both adults. Believe me... I know.\n\nIt hurts. She shouldn't have to do this.
