Tbh, my parents checked out somewhere around kid #5. I was always able to do pretty much whatever I want. \n\nMy oldest sister (34) had a rough year. She and her fianc\u00e9 broke up and her baby died at 6 weeks old. She decided to move back in and take care of me since my parents travel a lot and it sucks. \n\nMy first class is study hall. My parents used to let me sleep in since it\u2019s not a real class but my sister takes my phone for 2 days if I\u2019m not in the car by 8. She also decided that my clothes were \u201cinappropriate\u201d so she went through my room with trash bags and confiscated everything that she doesn\u2019t like. She put a tracker and parental controls on my phone because she\u2019s mad that I sometimes go out at lunch and she thinks I\u2019m on my phone too much. She also packs me one of those stupid bento lunches every day because she can\u2019t stand that I get lunch from McDonald\u2019s. I also have a bedtime now. What 14 year old has a bedtime?\n\nIt really fucking sucks but I can deal with it. Then 2 weeks ago progress reports came back and she found out I wasn\u2019t doing my homework. She decided that now I\u2019m not allowed to go out after school and she takes my phone the second I walk in and I can\u2019t get it back until she checks my homework. I never get to see my friends anymore so I lied and told her that I was going to stay at school late for tutoring then I turned my phone off so she can\u2019t track me and went out with my friends but she actually went to my school to look for me and when I wasn\u2019t there she drove around until she found me and made me get in the car. It was so embarrassing. \n\nWhen we got home she started to yell at me for being irresponsible and I kinda lost it and told her it\u2019s not my fault her fianc\u00e9 left, she lost her kid, and she quit her job and had to come back here so I don\u2019t know why she has to take it out on me and be such a bitch. She cried and locked herself in her room and she hasn\u2019t come out for like a day and a half. I think I went too far. Was I the asshole for yelling at her because she\u2019s literally ruining my life because hers fell apart", "created_utc": 1682790687, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13326oa/aita_for_telling_my_sister_its_not_my_fault_she/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She isn't ruining your life, she's implementing structure and rules and those are things you need to get used to to be a functional adult. You should be thanking her.", "YTA *Oh, the horror*, you have to go to school on time, do your homework, eat healthier food, act responsibly and not spend all your time on your phone. You weren't doing fine, you were doing what you wanted and now you're upset someone is holding you accountable and treating you like a 14 year old.", "So you're upset because your parents checked out and aren't around, but then someone tried to parent you and you're upset?? What do you want here? \n\nShe makes you healthier food, makes sure you don't flunk out of school, tries to take care of you, and you're an ungrateful AH. You're too used to doing whatever you want that you became entitled and just rude. \n\nYes your sister sounds a bit extreme, but it sounds like you need it. YTA", "OMG You\u2019ve been allowed to become independent and unbridled at too young an age to realize the consequences of your immaturity and lack of parents.  No doubt it\u2019s hard to be reigned in when you\u2019re accustomed to doing what you want when you want.  You\u2019re sister is trying to save you from yourself and help you to make good decisions.  Your nasty comments to her were untrue and unnecessary and you said them to hurt her.  That\u2019s why YTA.", "WOW, the responses here.\n\nNAH, except for your parents who created this situation. \n\nYou've been on your own a long time and you're really independent and your sister is clamping you down to what's more appropriate for a 10 to 12-year-old than a 14-year-old, and you've been on your own for so long that even if she clamped down on you appropriately it would probably feel like a tremendous burden given your own experiences. You are experiencing major upheaval and your emotional endurance is used up.  That doesn't make you an asshole, that makes you a young person.\n\nYour sister is *also* going through tremendous upheaval and pain right now.  She couldn't save her own baby or her own situation, but she wants to save you. She wants to be the parent her baby needed and the parents *she* needed and didn't have, and the parents you need, but the reality is she doesn't know, at her age and life experience, how to be a parent to a teenager. \n\nBelieve it or not, you're both on the same team. You both want what's best for you, and for her to heal from what she has been through, but right now everything is super amplified for both of you.  \n\nThe way you lashed out is pretty age-appropriate, but of course she isn't normally the parent of a teenager and she's not your parent and so she's taking this personally and it really hurts. Your kids say things to you that are so hurtful and so on point and it's part of their growing process and it takes everything in you as a parent not to shout back and not to let it cut you to the bone.\n\nI don't have a solution for you, only for you to know that both of you are figuring out your roles, and both of you are learning and growing so fast right now, and I hope you can stay on the same side, The two of you against the world not the two of you against each other.\n\nA good start might be telling her \"I know you want the best for me and I want the best for you. All these changes have been heard from me and I'm used to being independent. I know that you are going through an extremely hard time.  I love you and I'm sorry I lashed out.\"\n\nUltimately what you and your sister need to hash out is what the priorities are, and from there with the expectations of you are. They can't stem from just what she wants but what you both agree would be positive for you. It seems like she's attacked every aspect of your life to try to optimize and it's placing a lot of demands on you.  She's also operating from a place of fear I would bet, given what she's experienced.  As a parent what I want for my kids is for them to eat a moderately healthy diet, fulfill their school obligations, and get enough sleep each night. Usually I can't have all three everyday, but we try, and in the long run the kids are actually doing much better than those three basic priorities appear to describe.  I also try to listen when they're having a hard time with a change I've implemented, for instance is the issue the bento lunches your sister is packing, or is the issue that by not having McDonald's you're being separated from your peer group?  \n\nSend a million mom hugs both you and your sister's way.", "ESH, everyone saying Y T A is completely wrong. Your parents are absolutely atrocious, leaving someone else to parent their child is bad. You\u2019re young so you\u2019re obviously struggling with dealing with yourself and you definitely need to apology but your sister is not right either. She had a death in her life life and she\u2019s clearly trying to prevent another one from happening in an unhealthy way, she needs therapy. Parental controls, going through your stuff and constantly taking away your phone is not going to help, it\u2019s overbearing and she should not be doing it but you do need parenting, less than that but you absolutely do. You need to sit down with her, apologize and explaining that she\u2019s going too far and that you don\u2019t appreciate her taking away your privacy.", "YTA. \n\nThe truth is that you NEED a parent. Your parents aren't parenting so someone has to. You need boundaries, limits and to do your homework. You need to attend study hall (obviously). Your sister is the one stepping up when your parents have failed for 14 years. \n\nNow, she could relax on things like the clothes. You should be able to express your personal style. But you aren't going to get anywhere with that by yelling and throwing a tantrum. You need to come to her with a plan on how you are going to get your grades up and how you can earn back some freedoms. Included in that can be that you want to have a certain style.", "ESH - but you're 14 so I don't expect you to have the experiential understanding of the magnitude of loss your sister has undergone. She's trying to control something she knows she can control after these things that happened to her that she had no control over. She's absolutely gone way overboard in some areas, for sure. But in others, these are parental standards if they're trying to be good parents. In your case it feels like too much because your parents are very inattentive & absent even. \n\nI'd apologize for hurting her. Let her know you're used to how your life was before & ask her to only flex her parental muscle on the most important stuff because she's just destroying a relationship with you. Let her know you value how much she cares about you & that she's stepped up for you so much, but to at least have a conversation with you like a normal person/ big sister before throwing down the gauntlet for every reason.", "What 14 year old has a bedtime?\n\nAll of them. No really. I'm sorry your parents have sucked and been too busy, but your sister has the right of it. One day I hope you will thank her.", "YTA - What a petulant, cruel and ungrateful little brat you are.", "Sounds like you went from having close to zero parental supervision and taking care of yourself to having quite a strict parental figure. If you feel constricted by that it's understandable. However your words were definitely too harsh so for that YTA. \nIt sounds like she was coming from a place of really wanting to \"help\". However her methods definitely sounds like a lot and also not understanding of your situation. Excessive conteolling behaviour is not helpful. (gotta say i definitely had a bed time at 14 and i know mcdonalds is tasty but a healthy lunch is actually a pretty good thing). I think you both need to level and have a talk about how you can work together. Sometimes ppl whos life falls apart try to find smth to control and that's definitely not your fault but lashing out is also not constructive.\nSo yeah, I'd say apologise and have a grown up talk about how you feel and how you can work the situation out together.", "NTA- That\u2019s a lot of change for someone who mostly had autonomy and she overdid it and you snapped. You\u2019re 14. \n\nSo now what? You did cross a line with your comments and probably really crushed her. Apologize. And talk to her. It\u2019s not you vs her. It\u2019s you and her vs the problem. So come up with a plan together. When it\u2019s not working, be honest and revise it. Tell her you want her to support you but in a way that doesn\u2019t take your autonomy and pit y\u2019all against each other. That you want her to guide you like a big sister not like a parent. And that you could come out of this with a really secure connection for you both. \n\nOr it could go the total opposite direction. But this could be wonderful for you both.", "NTA. Why are you doing anything other than laughing at her and her ridiculous attempt to play fake mom? She isn't your parent, she has zero authority over you. \n\nYou don't have to do a damn thing she says. You can feel sympathy for someone without putting up with their abuse. Stop giving her your phone. Remove all trackers and parental controls. Go to bed when you're ready. Live your life the same way you would if she wasn't there. Ignore every crazy demand that flies out of her mouth. \n\nIf your parents get involved tell them to come home and raise their own kid, because you're not going to let your sister pretend like she's your mom, or put up with her taking her frustrations out on you. Under no circumstance should you continue being your sisters doormat. You're 14, not 4.", "ESH let's start with your parents. If they decided to have 7 kids, then it's on them to step up and parent you, instead of letting you do whatever you want. Also most 14 year olds have a bedtime, as being so young getting enough sleep is important. If they can't handle the responsibility of raising all their kids, then they shouldn't have had 7. Birth control exists for a reason.\n\nYour sister is the lesser ah simply because she's grieving and had a lot of shit happen to her in a short span. She needs therapy, not lip from a little brat. Also she needs to get your parents to deal with you, so she can recover and move forward with her life.\n\nYou are an ah for snapping at her. You don't have to like everything, but genuinely she's trying to set you up to succeed in life instead of falling flat on your ass and failing. If you hate it so much, then tell her to have your parents step up. And no its not healthy for a 14 year old to constantly have mcdonalds for lunch. Diabetes isn't fun kiddo, it's not cheap. Neither is increasing your risk of heart problems. Now go apologize to your sister.", "YTA- she\u2019s being a parent to you and implementing rules you very clearly need in your life. Your sister honestly isn\u2019t that strict at all either, you sound like you\u2019re out of control and aren\u2019t paying attention to yourself. McDonald\u2019s for lunch everyday is insanely unhealthy and her giving you food is really kind of her. Half of the clothes are probably really, really short and in all honesty you\u2019re 14 and don\u2019t need to be wearing things that show your body off to the whole world. She\u2019s taking away your phone because you\u2019re tanking your grades by not doing your homework and eventually it\u2019ll guarantee you won\u2019t get anywhere in life if you fuck up in high school. Parental controls are perfectly normal and so is the bedtime, I had one at 14. I get where your coming from, because at 14 you think you\u2019re grown enough to do all this, but you aren\u2019t. You need stable parenting and clearly your sisters doing that. Be grateful.", "YTA. You\u2019re young and you\u2019re at that age where you think everyone is stupid and you know best *and* you\u2019re not used to being told what to do/ having authority figures so your emotions around this make sense. Your sister also isn\u2019t your parent and is doing some controlling things \u2014I think throwing your clothes out is inappropriate\u2014but most of what she\u2019s doing sounds in your best interests. She\u2019s making you healthy food and making sure you do your work. If you are lying and squandering your own education, you are ruining your own life and she is doing the right thing to try to put a stop to it.\n\nYou owe your sister an apology. What you said is horrific. Don\u2019t ever bring up her baby ever again in anything but kindness and empathy. That is one of the meanest things I\u2019ve ever heard.", "YTA\n\nshe\u2018s giving you the parenting that your parents are unable to do. It sucks for you but be grateful that at least one person tries to help you build a better future - and her rules are normal.", "YTA.\n\nYour sister's attempts to install some discipline and organization in your life did come abruptly and she does seem to be somewhat inexperienced when implementing them. By holy crap, someone needs to do it. Your sisters somewhat amateurish attempts are light years better than outright neglect that you had.\n\nAnd yes, do your homework. All of it.", "YTA. Noone is 'literally ruining' your life. Yes, her rules seem excessive..but that's basically because you've been getting away with a lot up until this point. Not doing your homework? She's absolutely right to intervene. \n\nYou're angry and that's understandable, but using the loss of her child against her was utterly disgusting. \n\n'What 14 year old has a bedtime?'\n\nLiterally loads.\n\n'She also packs me one of those stupid bento lunches every day because she can\u2019t stand that I get lunch from McDonald\u2019s.'\n\nI cannot believe you're angry because someone is making you a decent lunch.", "NTA\n\nOP is a child going from laissez-faire parents to Stalin running the show. The blowout is  more on  the mother that lost her child and is using her sister as a stand-in for her and her actual parents that are not doing their jobs.\n\nOP is not an emotional support animal nor is she supposed to emotionally manage her sister's feelings. OP needs help not other adults telling her to be mindful of sister that is crossing lines.", "Without voting, she needs serious therapy.\n\nYesterday.", "YTA. You sound like you're out of control and another statistic to be a high school drop out or barely graduate high school. She saw this and has tried to help create structure and improve your life outcome. You were way out of line for what you said to her.

She needs therapy and it sounds like her life will be better if she moves out.", "Yta. Do your schoolwork. It sounds like you desperately need the structure your sister is trying to provide.", "This thread is full of absolute psychos.

That's literally the opposite of what you do to prove that she is off base for being on your case.

Ffs I could even understand how it could be a little overwhelming and feeling maybe like she\u2019s putting too much on you but man you went straight into asshole territory. She didn\u2019t permanently take your phone, she didn\u2019t stop you from going out with your friend she just wanted to make sure you were doing your homework which you clearly don\u2019t do. Did you not think that if you spent 1hr doing homework, you could spent more time with your friends? You got what you wanted, she won\u2019t care anymore, go back to doing fuck all and barely scraping through school but don\u2019t you dare complain that no one cares to your mates. You were embarrassed when someone cared about you. I hope you never have to go through the pain your sister went through and one day you\u2019ll look back on this with shame on how you acted towards her.", "ESH, you shouldn't have thrown her break up and the death of her child in her face like that. If she wants to be a kind of guardian to you, she needs to do it another way that makes you both comfortable because she is not your parent. My guess is she does care about you, but it may also be an unconscious and potentially unhealthy coping mechanism. She needs grief counselling, and you need to do your flipping homework.", "ESH- the way you spoke about her child's death was harsh. That said, I don't think you are wrong about your sister true intentions. It's very suspiscious that she decided to care and being a \"parental figure\" for you just now when her baby died, she is divorced and have no perspective to have a kid at 34. She might feel that she lost her chance of being a mother and is using you as a surrogate child to cope. I don't think her actions are coming from a place of genuine care for you.Even If I'm wrong about that, the way she's trying to help you Will never work.

Tbh, my parents checked out somewhere around kid #5. I was always able to do pretty much whatever I want. \n\nMy oldest sister (34) had a rough year. She and her fianc\u00e9 broke up and her baby died at 6 weeks old. She decided to move back in and take care of me since my parents travel a lot and it sucks. \n\nMy first class is study hall. My parents used to let me sleep in since it\u2019s not a real class but my sister takes my phone for 2 days if I\u2019m not in the car by 8. She also decided that my clothes were \u201cinappropriate\u201d so she went through my room with trash bags and confiscated everything that she doesn\u2019t like. She put a tracker and parental controls on my phone because she\u2019s mad that I sometimes go out at lunch and she thinks I\u2019m on my phone too much. She also packs me one of those stupid bento lunches every day because she can\u2019t stand that I get lunch from McDonald\u2019s. I also have a bedtime now. What 14 year old has a bedtime?\n\nIt really fucking sucks but I can deal with it. Then 2 weeks ago progress reports came back and she found out I wasn\u2019t doing my homework. She decided that now I\u2019m not allowed to go out after school and she takes my phone the second I walk in and I can\u2019t get it back until she checks my homework. I never get to see my friends anymore so I lied and told her that I was going to stay at school late for tutoring then I turned my phone off so she can\u2019t track me and went out with my friends but she actually went to my school to look for me and when I wasn\u2019t there she drove around until she found me and made me get in the car. It was so embarrassing. \n\nWhen we got home she started to yell at me for being irresponsible and I kinda lost it and told her it\u2019s not my fault her fianc\u00e9 left, she lost her kid, and she quit her job and had to come back here so I don\u2019t know why she has to take it out on me and be such a bitch. She cried and locked herself in her room and she hasn\u2019t come out for like a day and a half. I think I went too far. Was I the asshole for yelling at her because she\u2019s literally ruining my life because hers fell apart\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And while sure, OP sounds like they very much do need more structure, 1) Big sis is coming in all of a sudden and enforcing these rules in a way that is not constructive and 2) it's not her place, and I am not surprised at all that a teenager is reacting badly to having their clothing thrown out, their phone taken, and being tracked.", "no, it isn\u2019t. giving a 14 year old a hard bedtime, tracking their location 24/7 and confiscating their phone the second they walk into the house is not being a good parent, it\u2019s being controlling. it especially isn\u2019t going to be easy for OP to adjust when she has had incredibly lax parenting in the past. all the people i know who had strict rules like this are the most wayward, lawless adults now. parents need to learn about *trust* and have a mutual agreement with their child on how to act, not monitor them 24/7.\n\ni\u2019m gonna go against the grain and say ESH. it sounds like OP\u2019s sister is supplementing her lost child with OP, just under the guise of \u201cbeing the parent she should\u2019ve had\u201d and frankly that is inappropriate. you don\u2019t get to go full helicopter mode on your own sister, especially when there was no transition period to start with, or no bad behaviour in the past that would justify it. idk if sis has good intentions or nor, but her \u201cparenting style\u201d is a very good way to make OP resent her in the future. OP is TA for attacking sister\u2019s struggles like that. \n\nseems a lot of people here calling a 14 year old kid an \u201cungrateful brat\u201d were victims of strict parents too. i pity you guys, that is not how you raise a child.", "The tracking app is also absolutely not okay at all.", "Omg how could she not do her homework!! Let\u2019s go through her stuff and put a tracking app because of it!! Totally normal!! If you agree with this then clearly you\u2019re in need of therapy just like the sister", "She doesn\u2019t have the right to throw her clothes away period. \u201cSlutty\u201d clothes?? She didn\u2019t buy the phone she can\u2019t take it away. Nothing indicates that sister didn\u2019t agree w the crowd op was hanging out with she was basically not allowing her to have an afterlife school. \nOp is not a replacement for her to play mommy.", "yeah i guess let's just encourage op to skip school and eating mcdonalds for lunch. god forbid they have an adult in their life actually care.", "good luck with this mentality when you go college and inevitably flunk because of it.", "I'll be honest with you as someone who used to have that mentality. It is not, your sister is really trying her best to be there for you. You won't see it now and it is a pain as it is a huge change suddenly. Yes YTA for what you said and need to apologise. Once everything is settled down sit down and talk to her find a balance. \n\nPlease believe me when I say this, she wants what is best for you, even if it means you hate her for it now and will see the effects later on.", "Future boss wont see it that way. I wouldnt hire you right now if you asked me for a job. You come off as lazy and wanting to do the minimal asked of you.", "OP, homework is a scam and not how anyone learns but it is how you play the game to get access to the next opportunities and then the next after that.  And playing the game will help you eventually have an acceptable income with opportunity for growth AND also hopefully find a job where you have the autonomy and independence where you can thrive, and don't have to take too much shit from other people. A major reason. To work on your education is so when you have a job with coworkers or Boss you don't want to be around, You have skills and knowledge in demand that allow you to get a *different* job.", "That\u2019s a really\u2026. I don\u2019t know a better way to put it but shitty attitude to have.", "In 5, 10 years,  believe me you will wish you tried harder in school.    It sets you up for the whole trajectory for your life.\n\nYour words to your sister were very cruel.  YTA", "You are an idiot and you need to stop acting like a spoiled brat. Do your homework and eat what she prepares, your liver and future career will thank you", "Lettuce rice and chicken dont cost that much... learn how to cook.... 14 is plenty old enough to learn how to cook basic things like chicken and rice", "No, but if you fail enough classes, you won't have enough credits to graduate high school. I know because I played the same game you're currently playing, then gambled and lost a couple too many times and had to take \"credit recovery\" in order to graduate on time.", "No but they can refuse to let you graduate if you haven't passed all the required classes.", "I would generally agree, but this kid is feral! She can delete it when kiddo is trustworthy.", "I will not engage with you. You are not being civil. Have the day you deserve.", "She isn't his parent. She doesn't get to make those \"rules\" up. Her opinion literally means nothing in that regard.", "Didn\u2019t do homework in college either. It was worth the point loss in classes that actually checked it.", "No one cares about GPA's. I'd only care how they work with others and if they can finish a task on time.\n\nI wouldn't hire a teen. Good grades or not. So I don't blame you for saying you wouldn't hire op.", "Lmao do you think prospective employers call up people\u2019s high school teachers in the hiring process?", ">Future boss wont see it that way.\n\nFuture boss doesn't give a shit about OP's homework today.", "It does not cost that much, but when you only have one or two dollars one day you don't have access to all those. In which the moment mcdonsld is cheaper. What if the child doest have access to a stove to cook?  It is definitely a situational thing.", "how is she feral? for turning off her phone once to get socialisation time from her monstrous sister?", "You just know you\u2019re wrong and refuse to admit it", "They should", "That sister isn't \"monstrous\". You read the perception of a neglected 14 year old. Of course she wants to do whatever she likes.", "Please do not make me block you. I will not engage with people who make personal attacks out of the blue. Not without an apology from you to me.  Cheers.", "People should call up someone\u2019s teachers from what for most job-seeking adults would be 7-10 years ago?", "They... probably shouldn't. Feedback from people who are effectively babysitters (in that teens don't attend school voluntarily) isn't really relevant to the performance you'd receive from someone you're paying."]}
