NTA", "The problem here is that you told her you had them. You're not telling us exactly how that conversation went, so we don't know if you said I have them they'll be here whenever you can get them or did you say you need to come get these right now because I'm not responsible for them? You're not saying which generally in this sub means it would make you look bad, but who knows. \n\nThe thing is that even if somebody that came to your house took them, you are still responsible for things inside your house. I don't understand why you're not more worried that these people that come to your house steal? Can't you contact them and ask if they have the pants? You know the people who stayed at your house just ask them", "It kinda feels like you should ask the other guests if they have them before looking to replace them, especially because her mom didn't mind for the two months they were missing apparently\n\nOtherwise kinda ESH -- her for not paying to have them shipped to her so you didn't have to watch them for two months, you for assuring her they were safe when they weren't.\n\nIf they're less than the price of two pedis you seemingly can easily afford it's probably not worth fighting over.", "Did you contact your other guests about the pants? Is it worth losing a friend over the pants? Not your responsibility, but I would have tried to track them down. NAH", "NTA. \n\nAs a rule, if someone leaves something at my house I put it aside and do nothing else. If nobody mentions it after a few weeks i dispose of it.\n\nI cant tell you how much time I spent chasing people down, or the total ungratefulness, before i moved to this policy.", "I would never make/ask my friend to pay for my clothes, but I would be mortified and def pay up if I lost my friends item on my watch. \n\nJust diff points of view. Replace the pants, enjoy the pedicures and be blessed to have such a busy guest room filled with visitors! \ud83d\udc96", "NTA, and have your sister mail the shorts back.", "she's had over a month to come get her shit. you shouldn't even be offering to cover half the cost. its not your responsibility. NTA", "You owe her exactly 0% of the pants, I don't know why you offered anything.\n\nNTA.", "Split half, dump friend.", "I mean, why would you put the pants back in the drawer?  If someone leaves something behind I just put it in a plastic bag and label it and put it by the front bench, or front closet.  \n\nBut I guess ESH. She did take her sweet time, but also, you had her pants and then lost her pants so.", "YTA. You had her item and it went missing in your house. I think you should ask your sister and other friend if they have the pants. It seems shitty that one of them clearly took something from your home that they knew was not theirs to begin with.", "Does this mean that either your sister or this friend actually stole these pants?\n\nLike, I see them, I like them, I'll take them?", "She could have asked you to mail them and she didn\u2019t. She was not responsible with something she borrowed and it\u2019s not your fault she is irresponsible.", "YTA.  You put them in a drawer that multiple other people had access to.

She's in South America traveling and had assumed they belonged to a female caller. She and my guest are friends which is how I met her. So the responsibility is out of my hands, even though it was never really mine.", "Our conversation went something like me first sending a pic and asking if they were hers. She said they were. I asked if she wanted me to send them to her and she declined. She asked if I could hold onto them and I said I'd rather send them but she didn't want to pay for the shipping. So into the drawer in my guest bedroom they went. My sister absconded with them, thinking they were left amongst my stuff by a random.

My sis and I sometimes borrow each other\u2019s clothes, or leave them at each other\u2019s place, and I make sure to wash them, fold them neatly and put them somewhere where no one else can get them and let sis know I have X article of clothing and return it asap.

Problem solved, no?", "Okay well in that case she can wait till sister comes home with them. They weren't a big priority before now so they don't need to be a priority right now! When she gets them she will get them."]}
