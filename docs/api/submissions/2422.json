My husband divorced his first wife, Candy, when the kids were 3 and 5. I (32F) met Frank after his divorce through a mutual friend a few months after his divorce. We dated almost 8 months before I met the kids. They were 4 and 6 and I've been in their lives ever since.  Frank and Candy split custody 50/50 and she and I are cordial and the 3 of us want what's best for the kiddos including individual and group therapy. We coordinate pickups and drop off at school and extracurriculars and sit next to each other at the kids events. \n\nBrenda has a passion for baking, she likes to watch shows about it and then try to follow recipes and even create her own. She also will try to mix ingredients without recipes just to see what will happen. Frank and I have encouraged this hobby as she finds the research and process of baking to be relaxing and fun. She is also responsible for cleaning up the kitchen after she bakes, an expectation she believes is also fair (we have a dishwasher that she knows how to load and use). We also bought her her own mixing bowls and baking utensils, but she has free use of all kitchen appliances, obviously.  However, she doesn't eat or want to really share her creations. She just likes the process and then will toss it. She will go through a more than pound of flour and 8 sticks of butter in a week. Alice likes to play online video games and will ask for money to buy in game money to play with her friends.\n\nWith growing food costs and to teach them the value of a dollar, Frank told both kids he was increasing their monthly allowance from $25 a month to $75, but with the stipulation that they both pay for their own hobbies. Meaning any baking Brenda wanted to do she can buy her supplies, and any in-game money Alice wanted to buy she can use her allowance for.\n\nSince increasing their allowance they are more hesitant to add money to their hobbies, though Brenda is still baking several times a month and Alice is still getting in game money but significantly less. Brenda has brought up frequently that she feels it's mean that she has to save her money (about 20 dollars worth) to pay for flour and dairy products when we should just buy it for her. We have explained our reasoning several times. Candy recently approached Frank and I demanding to know why we are not being supportive of Brenda's hobby. We explained the reasoning behind it and she insists we should just pay for it to be supportive. We have argued that this is supportive and also a teaching tool to learn that things cost money and how to save for things you want, which both kids have demonstrated by saving and minimizing their purchases. Candy also doesn't allow Brenda to bake at her home because she \"Doesn't have time to deal with it\", even though she is capable of cleaning up with minor supervision. \n\nAITA for including my stepchildren's hobbies in their allowance?", "created_utc": 1668542390, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yw7uoj/aita_for_including_my_stepdaughters_hobby/", "score": 265, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your stipulation with the allowances is reasonable IMO.  I do think it is incredibly wasteful and definitely \"teaching the wrong message\" to allow Brenda to bake just to throw what she makes away.

She needs to be encouraged to actually bake and not just experiment and toss things.", "Um, nta.\nBut, honestly, try looking online for classes for creative cooking/baking. We're in the Reno area and occasionally,  we've seen classes for baking those funky cakes you see on those food network Halloween shows. I died when my wife showed me the expectation of eyeball cookies versus her cousins actual attempts (think boob cookies). The spider cup cakes turned out cool, tho, complete with purple glitter frosting you could eat. We also just ran across a neat 3d painting class at one of the Cafe sites my wife does delivery for. Point being,  keep your eyes out, there are all kinds of opportunities for her to grow her skills. \nBut, yes, making her learn how expensive food waste can be is smart. It will make her learn to be more careful and do her research before she starts mixing. \nAs an aside, my wife does think that you should have an in depth conversation with her about what is it she's trying to achieve with the ideas she has about mixing ingredients? Is there a taste or texture she's going for or is it just to see how horrible it could look/taste? If it's the former, a good class on how foods go together could be helpful.  If it's the latter,  well, she needs to understand that isn't sustainable,  which is what you're teaching her by making her use her own money. She's learning accountability.", "I used to try to bake things when I was little (youngest memory of me trying to bake was 5) and my mum wouldn't exactly encourage me, because, of course what I made was disgusting but she would make me try my creations. This caused me to become better at baking as I didn't want to eat horrible cakes.\n\nNTA for the expenses in her allowance. But stop the food waste and make her eat it.", "NTA and you should be commended for teaching them life skills. There are no free rides and learning to be responsible with money will help them a lot more in life then just throwing money at them so they don\u2019t bother you", "NTA\n\nYou all increased their allowance so they could pay for their own hobbies.

I pay rent/groceries to my parents so it helps with what I eat usually and they buy staples for my baking/cooking as unlike what she is doing, my creations gets shared through my family, their coworkers, friends, etc.\n\nI am horrified though by the idea of her just going through all that with no regard and not sharing anything. A huge love for baking is sharing it with my loved ones and hearing what their friends/people they know like or feel about it when they give some away. I would gently encourage her to find recipes online if things she'd like to make that she could have others taste/eat as while experimenting is great, as someone who bakes it's a warm feelings at the \"Mmm\" you hear when someone eats your baking/cooking.\n\nNTA, good on your for cultivating her curiosity and responsibility.", "I'm confused.

If I gave them to the neighbors it would frankly be insulting. \"Here, throw this away in your trash, not mine.\" This is one of the reasons we wanted to have the allowance, to limit the food waste and have her be more careful with her ingredients.", "There are so many other, far worse food wasters in the world.

It is so incredibly wasteful for her to bake and then just throw it away.", "Thank you for your judgement as I really appreciate this perspective. Not arguing, but responding to some points I wasn't able to include in the original post. \n\nI mentioned in a few other comments that I grew up poor and really, really hate wasting food which is why we set her on a budget and it has greatly reduced the amount of \"experimenting\" she does, making her food more edible. I assure you, before when she was using up so many ingredients it was wasteful which is why we tried suggesting cooking classes, and a few other things like making sandwich bread or dinner rolls before setting a budget, which has successfully curbed her more wasteful tendencies. \n\nI knew posting about wasting food would trigger some people in just how decedent and   \nshitty just throwing out food is, and for that I severally apologize and want to acknowledge that I agree with you, but I also have to consider my stepdaughters using this as one of her only creative outlets and she is very slowly learning to share (not with her sister) but with her father and I. We do what we can but I am gluten sensitive and he has to limit his carb intake. Plus, frankly, alot of the things she makes are inedible.\n\nAgain, thank you for your judgement.

We offered classes, baking with friends or us, youtube tutorials and have purchased several kid cookbooks for her to get inspired and follow but she simply isn't interested. Baking is also the only other thing she is interested in besides screens and it helps with her anxiety so I'm not going to discourage her from doing something she likes, but the allowance was to minimize the food waste and it has, she is looking at recipes more and less \"experiments\". \n\nI mentioned in another comment that she does not want to bake things like sandwich bread or dinner rolls because that is \"boring\" and she genuinely enjoys making the sweet stuff, even if it is inedible and unappetizing.

Your approach sounds very reasonable and thoughtful, and is a valuable lesson.

They are making the decision that they don't think the hobbies are worth $600 - they prefer to have the $600 in their pocket. That seems like a mature decision on their part.\n\nThey are kids - stop explaining your reasoning to them. Your reasoning is sound, they are learning the lesson, but they'll probably be in their late teens and graduated from high school before they realize this. It will hit them when they have their own apartment and they go to the grocery store - \"I can make my own dinner and have money to go to the movies, or I can order a pizza delivered and stay home and watch TV.\"\n\nYou are the parents - they are 11 and 13. You have experience - they don't. You're supposed to teach them.", "NTA.  You are responsible for providing her with shelter, clothing, and food TO EAT.

Just a thought.\nMaybe she would enjoy making something and taking it to a food bank or something like that.", "NTA - you are teaching them responsibility for their money. My kid has a gaming hobby and he spends his allowance on what he wants, he also bakes while it\u2019s not a hobby it\u2019s just here or there.

That is not teaching her a good lesson.", "Yta, you keep saying it's a \"hobby\". She might think it's her calling and is trying to become a baker. You should be encouraging her, she's not out prowling the streets getting into trouble. She actually  learning a trade. Her sister is playing games. You raised the allowance  just to make them pay. But (you) pushed what was not broken. Example... they were having you pay for the ingredients,  where they had a smaller  allowance,  but you raised it and made them spend and it seems to the you are making them lose money.

Much cheaper, you can buy it in large quantities and will still  give similar results", "Not that you can\u2019t experiment with baking, but it\u2019s more of a science than cooking.

It has single and small batch recipes, including desserts, so she could make these small batches, your family could eat it, and not have to waste as much. It has been a valuable resource for me, since me sons have grown up and my husband travels a lot (so I make dinners that I love and he hates when he's out of town).

Cause yikes", "I experiment quite often - and yes, you get the occasional bomb, but it turns out fairly decent the majority of the time, with the occasional winner.  She shouldn\u2019t be starting without a plan.  Instead, you learn (or look up) the \u201crules\u201d for how things substitute and use that to modify established recipes.  I wouldn\u2019t want to try something if anyone was just throwing stuff together willy nilly, but when you know the quantity of flour to fats,then you know how you can sub oil/butter/shortening/applesauce and you know how different flours act in comparison, you have a good base.  Then you play with flavors given what you think sounds good together.\n\nI think it\u2019s fair for them to set some boundaries on this - like give people the option to eat what she makes.  (What\u2019s the point of baking if no one eats it?). Other than that, it seems they accomplished their purpose - both girls are realizing how much they\u2019ve been spending and valuing money differently.  It\u2019s easy to use a tone of ingredients when someone else has to pay!", "Yeah this seems to be the path. Like if she actually wants to experiment with baking, then she needs to actually learn how to bake. It just sounds like she's making slime that then gets thrown away.", "Yeah like given how this is being talked about, it sounds like she isn't experimenting really.

Not a substitute for proper bread flour but works fine for most other things, as long as you adjust the baking soda etc. inputs to account for it.", "I have self rising flour.", "I have to experiment with baking because I have a  lot of food allergies. My go to book is one called \"Ratios\" which basically has the simplified ratio for many basic baked goods (muffins, cakes, bread, etc)\n\nThen it's basically just doing some math plus adding whatever flavoring I was want. I also keep notes so if something goes exceptionally well/badly, I know what I did and can repeat/avoid.\n\nSo far everything has been edible, although a couple of times I made a math error and it was still edible but slightly less delicious.\n\nThat might be a possible way for her to experiment while still making edible food", "I just ordered that book.

What this kid is doing won\u2019t create a usable product or a skill.", "The difference seems to be that you were trying to make something nice while the girl that is baking seems to be hapharzardly throwing things together for the hell of it.", "I would suggest she cut her recipes in half or one quarter, so she's using less ingredients, and she learns some math too.", "Can you share a link to the set? I'd love to purchase for some niblings!"]}
