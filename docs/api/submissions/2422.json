My husband divorced his first wife, Candy, when the kids were 3 and 5. I (32F) met Frank after his divorce through a mutual friend a few months after his divorce. We dated almost 8 months before I met the kids. They were 4 and 6 and I've been in their lives ever since.  Frank and Candy split custody 50/50 and she and I are cordial and the 3 of us want what's best for the kiddos including individual and group therapy. We coordinate pickups and drop off at school and extracurriculars and sit next to each other at the kids events. \n\nBrenda has a passion for baking, she likes to watch shows about it and then try to follow recipes and even create her own. She also will try to mix ingredients without recipes just to see what will happen. Frank and I have encouraged this hobby as she finds the research and process of baking to be relaxing and fun. She is also responsible for cleaning up the kitchen after she bakes, an expectation she believes is also fair (we have a dishwasher that she knows how to load and use). We also bought her her own mixing bowls and baking utensils, but she has free use of all kitchen appliances, obviously.  However, she doesn't eat or want to really share her creations. She just likes the process and then will toss it. She will go through a more than pound of flour and 8 sticks of butter in a week. Alice likes to play online video games and will ask for money to buy in game money to play with her friends.\n\nWith growing food costs and to teach them the value of a dollar, Frank told both kids he was increasing their monthly allowance from $25 a month to $75, but with the stipulation that they both pay for their own hobbies. Meaning any baking Brenda wanted to do she can buy her supplies, and any in-game money Alice wanted to buy she can use her allowance for.\n\nSince increasing their allowance they are more hesitant to add money to their hobbies, though Brenda is still baking several times a month and Alice is still getting in game money but significantly less. Brenda has brought up frequently that she feels it's mean that she has to save her money (about 20 dollars worth) to pay for flour and dairy products when we should just buy it for her. We have explained our reasoning several times. Candy recently approached Frank and I demanding to know why we are not being supportive of Brenda's hobby. We explained the reasoning behind it and she insists we should just pay for it to be supportive. We have argued that this is supportive and also a teaching tool to learn that things cost money and how to save for things you want, which both kids have demonstrated by saving and minimizing their purchases. Candy also doesn't allow Brenda to bake at her home because she \"Doesn't have time to deal with it\", even though she is capable of cleaning up with minor supervision. \n\nAITA for including my stepchildren's hobbies in their allowance?", "created_utc": 1668542390, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yw7uoj/aita_for_including_my_stepdaughters_hobby/", "score": 1412, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your stipulation with the allowances is reasonable IMO.  I do think it is incredibly wasteful and definitely \"teaching the wrong message\" to allow Brenda to bake just to throw what she makes away.

She needs to be encouraged to actually bake and not just experiment and toss things.", "Um, nta.\nBut, honestly, try looking online for classes for creative cooking/baking. We're in the Reno area and occasionally,  we've seen classes for baking those funky cakes you see on those food network Halloween shows. I died when my wife showed me the expectation of eyeball cookies versus her cousins actual attempts (think boob cookies). The spider cup cakes turned out cool, tho, complete with purple glitter frosting you could eat. We also just ran across a neat 3d painting class at one of the Cafe sites my wife does delivery for. Point being,  keep your eyes out, there are all kinds of opportunities for her to grow her skills. \nBut, yes, making her learn how expensive food waste can be is smart. It will make her learn to be more careful and do her research before she starts mixing. \nAs an aside, my wife does think that you should have an in depth conversation with her about what is it she's trying to achieve with the ideas she has about mixing ingredients? Is there a taste or texture she's going for or is it just to see how horrible it could look/taste? If it's the former, a good class on how foods go together could be helpful.  If it's the latter,  well, she needs to understand that isn't sustainable,  which is what you're teaching her by making her use her own money. She's learning accountability.", "I used to try to bake things when I was little (youngest memory of me trying to bake was 5) and my mum wouldn't exactly encourage me, because, of course what I made was disgusting but she would make me try my creations. This caused me to become better at baking as I didn't want to eat horrible cakes.\n\nNTA for the expenses in her allowance. But stop the food waste and make her eat it.", "NTA and you should be commended for teaching them life skills. There are no free rides and learning to be responsible with money will help them a lot more in life then just throwing money at them so they don\u2019t bother you", "NTA\n\nYou all increased their allowance so they could pay for their own hobbies.

I pay rent/groceries to my parents so it helps with what I eat usually and they buy staples for my baking/cooking as unlike what she is doing, my creations gets shared through my family, their coworkers, friends, etc.\n\nI am horrified though by the idea of her just going through all that with no regard and not sharing anything. A huge love for baking is sharing it with my loved ones and hearing what their friends/people they know like or feel about it when they give some away. I would gently encourage her to find recipes online if things she'd like to make that she could have others taste/eat as while experimenting is great, as someone who bakes it's a warm feelings at the \"Mmm\" you hear when someone eats your baking/cooking.\n\nNTA, good on your for cultivating her curiosity and responsibility.", "I'm confused.

If I gave them to the neighbors it would frankly be insulting. \"Here, throw this away in your trash, not mine.\" This is one of the reasons we wanted to have the allowance, to limit the food waste and have her be more careful with her ingredients.", "There are so many other, far worse food wasters in the world.

It is so incredibly wasteful for her to bake and then just throw it away.", "Thank you for your judgement as I really appreciate this perspective. Not arguing, but responding to some points I wasn't able to include in the original post. \n\nI mentioned in a few other comments that I grew up poor and really, really hate wasting food which is why we set her on a budget and it has greatly reduced the amount of \"experimenting\" she does, making her food more edible. I assure you, before when she was using up so many ingredients it was wasteful which is why we tried suggesting cooking classes, and a few other things like making sandwich bread or dinner rolls before setting a budget, which has successfully curbed her more wasteful tendencies. \n\nI knew posting about wasting food would trigger some people in just how decedent and   \nshitty just throwing out food is, and for that I severally apologize and want to acknowledge that I agree with you, but I also have to consider my stepdaughters using this as one of her only creative outlets and she is very slowly learning to share (not with her sister) but with her father and I. We do what we can but I am gluten sensitive and he has to limit his carb intake. Plus, frankly, alot of the things she makes are inedible.\n\nAgain, thank you for your judgement.

If she really thinks Brenda's hobby should be encouraged (though not enough to want to deal with the mess) she is welcome to cover material costs herself. She can include a shopping bag full of ingredients among the things she sends Brenda off with when it's time to go back to your place (or grocery store gift cards/cash, if the errand of purchasing ingredients is among the things she \"doesn't have time to deal with\").

Maybe then Candy will finally understand what it is she's insisting you need to subsidize.\n\nETA: On a tangent, you've mentioned in responses that Brenda doesn't show interest in any of your attempts to redirect her energy in ways that would result in edible end products, which suggests to me that she doesn't actually care about baking as a skill to be improved on. Has Brenda been assessed for any neurodivergent conditions? Not to armchair psychoanalyze, but it sounds like her reason for liking this hobby is the sensory stimulation she experiences when mixing/kneading/rolling doughs during the baking process, which could be a sign she's ND.

Good life lesson to learn. \n\nI always found that when I told my kids they'd have to pay for something they actually thought and made better decisions than when they know the bank of Mom and Dad was open.

If you had simply told them they would be paying for their own hobbies now I might say otherwise, but as you tripled their monthly allowance at the same time I think you're giving them a good opportunity to learn how to work with a set budget. $50 a month for baking supplies especially if the food isn't getting eaten is pretty liberal, and as you said Brenda is still baking frequently. Honestly this will probably work itself out after a period of adjustment, worst case scenario you find out Candy wants to spoil her and you'll have to set some co-parenting boundaries.", "It strikes me that not only does she like baking, she is very curious about the science of baking.

I\u2019m glad OP\u2019s husband is trying to curtail the food waste, but *dear gods,* I can\u2019t believe it took this long.", ">it just feels more obscene when it's food for some reason \n\nbecause people need food to survive, and many people grow up with starvation nipping at their heels \n\nintentionally wasting food is an obscene, disgusting, completely and totally depraved behavior that only someone completely out of touch with reality would condone", "My little sister mixed random spices into water \u201csoups\u201d when she was 4. I had to double check the kid\u2019s age - 13 is way too old to be randomly throwing ingredients together and wasting that kind of food!", "A pound of flour and 8 sticks of butter. A Pound is about 500 grams and a stick of butter is 250 grams. With a ratio of 1:4 flour to butter thank fucking Christ no one is eating it. It would be more of a soup than a baked good", "Wasting food deliberately isnt a hobby. \n\nSure something can go wrong and then you have to toss it. But its unacceptable to waste huge amounts of food on a regular basis.", "Add sugar and you've got shortbread. It's kind of boring, though. And the ratio is off.", "Two pounds of butter? Sounds like your average French dish haha.", "I mean, pound cake is literally 1lb each of flour, sugar, butter, and eggs.\n\nMaybe she\u2019s just eating the other half of the butter.", "This is such an easy fix. Obviously a young girl doesn't want to make boring dinner rolls, theres so many youtube videos online of colourful cakes. She can make super simple vanilla cakes and just mix in food dye and still have the colourful fun while making something edible the family can eat. I used to be one of those 'experimental' kids but I never made food with the intention to just toss it away, a lot of times my experiments failed but I did also look up recipes.\n\nJust look up some crazy rainbow cakes on youtube or otherwise tell her that she will have to eat the food she makes and then you will see that she will stick to recipes more.", "Going off your earlier history she was into art. I'm inclined to believe you're really stretching the truth, she changed hobbies. I'm guessing recently and this hasn't been that long. Wow big surprise, it's called kids. Plus the fact her sister agrees? YTA and I should prob post this as a main comment\n\nEdit: I'm sorry, why is there they need to go full nuclear right away? Just give her a limit to make one experiment a month, the rest have to be edible. Even say \"to keep your\" whatever the proper word is form/cooking/skill. It's not rocket science. It's kids", "Yeah saw that afterwards. She did say somewhere else that since buying the materials herself, the daughter has been more open to them so in that sense I\u2019d say that\u2019s a bonus success for the allowance", "Honestly it sounds like an eating disorder, as she makes and throws out high calorie items. Plus the degree of control she insists on.", "thank you. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills reading these comments defending flagrant food waste \n\nmy ass would have been black and blue if I'd intentionally wasted ANY food, let alone literal pounds of it! Obviously OP shouldn't beat their kid but they SHOULD be teaching them to be thankful for what they have. Otherwise you end up with a spoilt brat that values nothing", "Same in Australia", "I only know this because trying to follow American recipes online has made me aware of it! 'All Purpose' flour means Plain!", "Lol that\u2019s awful but I love how creative you were to make it work!", ">My 13 year old niece makes ... macarons\n\nHOW?! Dude I've been trying for weeks to make them and the batter just ends up being runny af :'(", "I mean, as a kid I was allowed to mess around with food, and also with paints, fabric, wood, whatever. And I did waste stuff. Thing is, I was using maybe a cup of proper food, and I was wasting old scraps of leftover fabrics. I still enjoy sewing and baking to this day. Sometimes I buy nice materials and it doesn't work out - but I try to make something good. \n\nThe equivalent of going through over a pound of flour (>454 grams for my fellow metric folks) and 8 sticks of butter (907 grams) in a week is buying a lovely bolt of silk velvet, cutting it all up into tiny pieces, and tossing it. \n\nBtw: where I live 250 g of butter is about \u20ac2,50. The US is more expensive. So she's spending what, USD 10 on butter alone, in a week. And tossing it. This way she's learning about the financial aspects of cooking or any hobby, and learning some responsibilities for her creations. 13 is old enough to learn how to cook and bake properly.\n\nNTA obviously.\n\nOnly if she was to make actual food that was being eaten by the family, it should come out of the household food budget. And still not endlessly. If the budget doesn't allow for cake every week, it's an extravaganze and can be payed with her own money.", "Deliberately wasting food is awful, and encouraging that as a hobby is awful parenting. A one-time experiment gone bad is excusable, doing it as routine is entitled. This is how I would expect billionaire kids to behave, or made-up fictional characters.\n\nNo other waste can be compared to food waste.", "All I could think about was poor Theo wearing that jacked up shirt Denise made him.", "I think the difference is if she\u2019s actually trying to recreate (or create!) a recipe or if she\u2019s just throwing whatever together, baking and then trashing it. The first one will of course involve throwing stuff out but that\u2019s part of the process whereas the second one is just 100% wasteful as she\u2019s not even trying to create something edible.", "I know Steve Mould has a fantastic YT channel where he explains all sorts of science in a very relaxed and fun way, she might enjoy watching that. He also has a book with experiments to do at home, which I have not seen, but it might be nice. \n\nAnother idea, if she likes the experimenting, is to see what museums near you have labs and diy exhibitions. Took my (young) nieces to the railway museum recently and they very much enjoyed the part where they could try themselves with all different set ups. (Breaks, different wheel types, airstreaming, etc.)\n\nI really enjoyed the experimenting part as a kid, I would set up all sorts of chemistry experiments just because I wanted to know what would happen. My parents helped me with plant stuff (their background) or whatever tool I decided I wanted to use. This installed a lifelong interest in the sciences. So stimulate that in your kiddo! It's very good, especially for girls, because they are often not show the STEM options available to them. (But I certainly would do so in a less wastefull way, and think your approach with the allowance is very good.)\n\nWith regards to the anxiety: have you asked her what part of the baking is helping her? Are there other ways that could be done? I find kneading dough a great way to deal with stress, but I make (usually delicious) bread in the end.  Does she have enough resources to deal with stress? Is her mental health okay? These are important questions to ask too.", "Maybe instead of pure science stuff, maybe some bath bomb kits or candle making kits? Stuff that you can just mix random colours together and hope for the best. If there are any steps it's only two or three then the rest is up to her. And it can be used afterwards too. There are plenty of things out there like that she might enjoy.", "How about getting her a book or kit on molecular gastronomy? A lot of the food and flavour experiments in that area are a fun mashup between cookery and chemistry.", "PM me. I make them and can walk you through what might be causing it.", "Is the air really thin that high up?", "So do Easy Bake Ovens", "Frankly I think the parents should invest in some sort of cooking/baking class for the daughter so can can learn how to create her own recipes.\n\nCooking is more forgiving when it comes to experimenting, but baking needs to be exact, so she really needs to learn what works and what doesn't so she can experiment properly.", "I hesitate to suggest it lest kiddo get inspired to fill your kitchen with gadgets and oddball ingredients, but she might like molecular gastronomy. Videos of Heston Blumenthal cooking, or projects like spherification and texture trips like foams and fluid gels, might be engaging for her but also get her thinking a bit differently about what she\u2019s doing.", ">She **also** will try to mix ingredients without recipes just to see what will happen.\n\nShe is not being foolish and wasteful, she is experimenting to see how baking *works*.\n\nBut I agree with you and others who think she is being wasteful if her concoctions can be palatable and she is throwing them away and refusing to let the family try them."]}
