We have decided to move his bedroom to the main floor of the house into the den but the only problem is a big elliptical that my parents have no use for anymore is taking up floor space, this thing weighs about 400 pounds so we can\u2019t just fold it up and store it away. While my husband (49m) and I were helping my mother (71) move the bed downstairs to the living room where it will stay untill there is room in the den; my husband agreed with my mother to take on the task of getting rid of the elliptical. Myself and my mother both told my husband that day that money is not very important what is most important is getting my Dad comfortable at home, which being in the living room which is open concept would be a little awkward. \nYesterday we find out my dad is being released from the hospital so I message my husband letting him know this and he needs to step up the pace of getting rid of the elliptical. I tell him if it hasn\u2019t sold yet it\u2019s time now to offer it for free, post in the buy nothing groups and community groups. \nThis morning I find out he hasn\u2019t done that, when I asked him why he is upset with me and said he thinks it\u2019s a waste. I remind him that having my father in a room is more important than a couple hundred bucks! I\u2019m so upset that even knowing my father is coming home didn\u2019t seem urgent to him.
