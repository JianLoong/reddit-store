You\u2019re going to have a heck of a time setting boundaries with that one. \n\nGood luck", "NTA\n\nNot only were you clear, but she ACKNOWLEDGED that it's forbidden.  I wouldn't even look at her again after that. NTA but MiL is definitely TA, as is ANYONE taking her side. \n\nEither follow the rules, or you don't go. You don't get to make your own rules at someone else's wedding.", "Everyone talking about how you disrespected your mil and scoop to her level. However at the same time if you did nothing it was gonna show she can continue to go against your wishes. She found out what happens when she does. For that reason I will go with NTA. A life long of being disrespected by your mil is not what anyone wants. Your mil refuses to show you respect at your wedding so why should you. If she wants it she got to earn it. She only get basic level and got to earn more. \n\nI would tell your husband you will apologize as long as his mom does too.", "NTA. she acknowledged that she was breaking your wishes and she did it anyway. perfect response.\n\nif she wanted so badly to make a speech it should have been a discussion between you, your husband, and her beforehand. she did it publicly to try to strong arm you so that you \"couldn't make a scene\". this marriage is gonna suck if your husband doesn't get off his mom's tits.", "NTA: it was your and your husbands wedding. You BOTH implemented the rule. She disregarded that because she wanted to do what she wanted and have control and not respect the boundaries put in place. NO means NO. Not convince me and definitely not do it anyway and then ask for forgiveness later and also not \u201cI don\u2019t understand them so they\u2019re invalid\u201d you\u2019re husband will continue excusing her weird controlling behaviour and you will always be expected to just get over it and succumb to her. This won\u2019t be good when you have kids\u2026 something to think about.\n\nEdit: too add, icing someone out because they didn\u2019t respect your boundaries is not a bad thing to do. If you disrespect someone\u2019s wishes on their wedding way, why should they waste energy talking to you? MIL knows what she\u2019s doing, they all do.", "I don\u2019t know if I agree with everyone here. The husband had plenty of opportunity to say it if he didn\u2019t agree with the no speeches rule.

Instead he\u2019s decided to go with \u201cmy bride is rude because it\u2019s okay for my mom to ignore our request but my bride must be polite.\u201d  This seems like a bad start. \n\nI\u2019m going with NTA.  It was new husband\u2019s role to handle his mom. Or disagree with the no speeches rule before the wedding. \n\nI think new husband is TA.  And also MIL.

At my best friend\u2019s wedding, she *planned* two speeches.

Anyone else tries to, do whatever you need to: turn the mike off, blast the music, push them off stage, idc. As long as there were no extra speeches. \n\nalthough, did your new hubby agree with the \u201cno speeches\u201d rule? If he didn\u2019t, I could see why he wouldn\u2019t stand up for you this time.

Whoever thought that you should have gone along with her disrespectful display is wrong.  Husband is completely wrong in choosing to accept MIL's actions.  The bride/groom set the agenda for the wedding and everyone else gets to enjoy it.  Maybe you could have called for the band to play something and asked husband to dance.  But, congratulations to you for saving the joy of the wedding and preserving your memories.", "NTA. It is your wedding and you made it clear what you wanted.

On the one hand it was your wedding and you were clear in your expectations. On the other hand, just because we have expectations and convey them responsibly doesn't mean other people have to follow them.... and it was also your husband's wedding day.

She was a mini AH herself.\n\nHere's the thing, it's incomprehensible to me that you would be this rude to your future MIL on your wedding day. I get wanting to be in charge of your big day and it being all about you and what you want but there are some things that simply aren't done. If she wasn't actively saying insulting things and was trying to give her best wishes, why would do this?\n\nI know you said \"loves making speeches, sometimes 15min long and not unusually mean speeches, disguised as humor\" but neglected to say her speech on your and your husband's wedding day was one such speech. I believe if it was, you would have stated that loud and clear in your post. Also, 'sometimes' is not 'always' and 15 minutes is certainly bearable for a formal occasion.\n\nYour petty little mean girl power move might end up causing ripples that impact you being accepted by his family, invitations to family functions as they years roll on and even future inheritances (not only by his parents but other members of his family who witnessed your behavior). Humiliating your husband's mother AND by extension, your husband on his wedding day was simply not a very bright decision on your part.\n\nIt's interesting that \"my husband was very angry that it showed in his profile, he refused to look at me\", MIL was furious, both SIL's were furious and my husbands side sulking in their seats.\" You described the rest of the night as awkward but stated, \"I wanted to make sure it wasn't ruined for the rest of us and we ended up having a blast. \" WTAF? Was this an arranged marriage? I only ask because you seem actively hostile not only to your MIL but his entire family. There is a real us vs them attitude in your post.\n\nIt feels almost like you think the wedding and reception was solely for your own enjoyment and gratification. It takes two to get married. At bare minimum, once you realized that your new husband was upset, you should have zipped your lips.\n\nI'll just hit on one more thing. Literally not allowing anyone to toast you OR YOUR HUSBAND on the wedding day simply because you find long toasts boring is the epitome of immaturity.
