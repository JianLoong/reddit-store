You\u2019re going to have a heck of a time setting boundaries with that one. \n\nGood luck", "NTA\n\nNot only were you clear, but she ACKNOWLEDGED that it's forbidden.  I wouldn't even look at her again after that. NTA but MiL is definitely TA, as is ANYONE taking her side. \n\nEither follow the rules, or you don't go. You don't get to make your own rules at someone else's wedding.", "Everyone talking about how you disrespected your mil and scoop to her level. However at the same time if you did nothing it was gonna show she can continue to go against your wishes. She found out what happens when she does. For that reason I will go with NTA. A life long of being disrespected by your mil is not what anyone wants. Your mil refuses to show you respect at your wedding so why should you. If she wants it she got to earn it. She only get basic level and got to earn more. \n\nI would tell your husband you will apologize as long as his mom does too.", "NTA. she acknowledged that she was breaking your wishes and she did it anyway. perfect response.\n\nif she wanted so badly to make a speech it should have been a discussion between you, your husband, and her beforehand. she did it publicly to try to strong arm you so that you \"couldn't make a scene\". this marriage is gonna suck if your husband doesn't get off his mom's tits.", "NTA: it was your and your husbands wedding. You BOTH implemented the rule. She disregarded that because she wanted to do what she wanted and have control and not respect the boundaries put in place. NO means NO. Not convince me and definitely not do it anyway and then ask for forgiveness later and also not \u201cI don\u2019t understand them so they\u2019re invalid\u201d you\u2019re husband will continue excusing her weird controlling behaviour and you will always be expected to just get over it and succumb to her. This won\u2019t be good when you have kids\u2026 something to think about.\n\nEdit: too add, icing someone out because they didn\u2019t respect your boundaries is not a bad thing to do. If you disrespect someone\u2019s wishes on their wedding way, why should they waste energy talking to you? MIL knows what she\u2019s doing, they all do.", "I don\u2019t know if I agree with everyone here. The husband had plenty of opportunity to say it if he didn\u2019t agree with the no speeches rule.

Instead he\u2019s decided to go with \u201cmy bride is rude because it\u2019s okay for my mom to ignore our request but my bride must be polite.\u201d  This seems like a bad start. \n\nI\u2019m going with NTA.  It was new husband\u2019s role to handle his mom. Or disagree with the no speeches rule before the wedding. \n\nI think new husband is TA.  And also MIL.

At my best friend\u2019s wedding, she *planned* two speeches.

Whoever thought that you should have gone along with her disrespectful display is wrong.  Husband is completely wrong in choosing to accept MIL's actions.

But, congratulations to you for saving the joy of the wedding and preserving your memories.", "NTA. It is your wedding and you made it clear what you wanted.

If expressing how she felt was so important, MIL could have written your husband a letter that he could have kept forever. Realistically she just wanted her own moment in the spotlight.", "ESH you asked her not to do one thing and she did it anyway, but you were publicly super rude about it and have likely damaged and relationship you could have had with MIL in the future.

Do you want a lifetime of that?!?", "ESH - you for being sooo blatantly rude and disrespectful to your mil; your mil for disregarding your wishes. \n\nI totally feel you on the speeches and we didn\u2019t allow speeches on our wedding day either.

She was a mini AH herself.\n\nHere's the thing, it's incomprehensible to me that you would be this rude to your future MIL on your wedding day. I get wanting to be in charge of your big day and it being all about you and what you want but there are some things that simply aren't done. If she wasn't actively saying insulting things and was trying to give her best wishes, why would do this?\n\nI know you said \"loves making speeches, sometimes 15min long and not unusually mean speeches, disguised as humor\" but neglected to say her speech on your and your husband's wedding day was one such speech. I believe if it was, you would have stated that loud and clear in your post. Also, 'sometimes' is not 'always' and 15 minutes is certainly bearable for a formal occasion.\n\nYour petty little mean girl power move might end up causing ripples that impact you being accepted by his family, invitations to family functions as they years roll on and even future inheritances (not only by his parents but other members of his family who witnessed your behavior). Humiliating your husband's mother AND by extension, your husband on his wedding day was simply not a very bright decision on your part.\n\nIt's interesting that \"my husband was very angry that it showed in his profile, he refused to look at me\", MIL was furious, both SIL's were furious and my husbands side sulking in their seats.\" You described the rest of the night as awkward but stated, \"I wanted to make sure it wasn't ruined for the rest of us and we ended up having a blast. \" WTAF? Was this an arranged marriage? I only ask because you seem actively hostile not only to your MIL but his entire family. There is a real us vs them attitude in your post.\n\nIt feels almost like you think the wedding and reception was solely for your own enjoyment and gratification. It takes two to get married. At bare minimum, once you realized that your new husband was upset, you should have zipped your lips.\n\nI'll just hit on one more thing. Literally not allowing anyone to toast you OR YOUR HUSBAND on the wedding day simply because you find long toasts boring is the epitome of immaturity.

You\u2019re not obligated to let her, obviously, but it would\u2019ve been good to at least hear each other out and reach a mutual understanding.

And yes, per other comments, this will be a pattern, as I can sadly attest to.  Finally, and unfortunately only fairly recently, after much therapy, I have recognized that my patterns regarding matters such as this, and other destructive ones, were formed early in my life due to the narcissistic abuse imposed on me by my mother.  Like all abuse, it's insidious because the abused only knows it as \"normal,\" or dare I say \"stubborn\".  Google effects of a narcissistic mother on a son and you will see what I mean.

Because we aren't the ones rocking the boat. It's the crazy lady jumping up and down and running side to side. Not the one sitting in the corner quietly not giving a fuck.\r  \n\r  \nAt some point in her youth, Mum/MIL gave the boat a little nudge. And look how everyone jumped to steady the boat! So she does it again, and again. Soon her family is in the habit of swaying to counteract the crazy. She moves left, they move right, balance is restored (temporarily). Life goes on. People move on to boats of their own.\r  \n\r  \nThe boat-rocker can't survive in a boat by herself. She's never had to face the consequences of her rocking. She'll tip over. So she finds an enabler: someone so proud of his boat-steadying skills that he secretly (or not so secretly) lives for the rocking.\r  \n\r  \nThe boat-rocker escalates. The boat-steadier can't manage alone, but can't let the boat tip. After all, he's the best boat-steadier ever, and that can't be true if his boat capsizes, so therefore his boat can't capsize. How can they fix the situation?\r  \n\r  \nBallast!\r  \n\r  \nAnd the next generation of boat-steadiers is born.\r  \n\r  \nA born boat-steadier doesn't know what solid ground feels like. He's so used to the constant swaying that anything else feels wrong and he'll fall over. There's a good chance the boat-rocker never taught him to swim either. He'll jump at the slightest twitch like his life depends on it, because it did .\r  \n\r  \nWhen you're in their boat, you're expected to help steady it. When you decline, the other boat-steadiers get resentful. Look at you, just sitting there while they do all the work! They don't see that you aren't the one making the boat rock. They might not even see the life rafts available for them to get out. All they know is that the boat can't be allowed to tip, and you're not helping.\r  \n\r  \nNow you and your partner get a boat of your own. With him not there, the balance of the boat changes. The remaining boat-steadiers have to work even harder.\r  \n\r  \nWhile a rocking boat is most concerning to those inside, it does cause ripples. The nearby boats start to worry. They're getting splashed! Somebody do something!\r  \n\r  \nSo the flying monkeys are dispatched. Can't you and your partner see how much better it is for everyone (else) if you just get back on the boat and keep it steady? It would make their lives so much easier.\r  \n\r  \nYou know what would be easier?
