I went to pick up both boys when I saw a crowd of kids by the fence. I went over and asked what was so interesting and they pointed to a snake.\n\nNot just a snake, but a rattlesnake. They had never seen one before (maybe outside a zoo) and I assume they were trying to get it to strike because they didn't think they'd get bit.\n\nI told them all to get away from it and they did except Jack who actually got closer with his phone. I think he wanted to get a closeup video of the snake striking. I yelled at him to get away and he told me to hold on. I took him by his arm and pulled him away. He gave me this angry stare. \n\nI told him what the fuck? That snake could kill you. He gave me the silent treatment until his mom picked him up.\n\nThen 20 minutes she called me up in a rage about how I grabbed him and did this and did that and hurt him etc and I'm not his dad.\n\nI asked her if her sweet angel told her about the rattlesnake that he was provoking. She said what snake. I hung up.\n\nShe called up again and said that I still owed her and Jack an apology for handling him. I told her to STFU and check his phone and see if I did any of that stuff as his camera was recording everything.\n\nAn hour later,  my brother called me up and said what Jack did was stupid and he was happy I was there but I still owed his wife an apology for telling her to STFU. I said I'm not apologizing for nothing. At least until she apologizes to me for coming at me sideways twice. To be honest I don't even care because I don't like her anyways.\n\nHe apologized and I said not acceptable.

Your brother demanded you apologize for dismissing a false accusation, so you're definitely not TA for insisting she apologize for false accusations. He wants to avoid drama in the family? He should have handled the entire Convo with you from the beginning.\n\nShe comes in hot? She can be embarrassed.", "NTA. Idt you did anything wrong. Bruh if you didn't end up helping Jack he would be snake poo rn. You're right to demand your SIL for an apology.", "NTA - you try to keep your nephew from winning himself a Darwin award and get yelled at not once but twice. Next time, let the snake educate your nephew. He'll learn a whole lot faster. What's sad is I bet if he had got bit mama would want you to foot the bills for not doing anything before yelling at the snake for hurting her baby.", "NTA. \n\nYour SIL needs to apologise. \n\nAnd LEARN that you don\u2019t just listen to kids then go nuclear. YOU ASK QUESTIONS!\n\nIf she had asked questions like a normal human then she would not have gone nuclear. She has issues. And she is teaching her son that he is a precious being that no one can discipline!\n\nI mean seriously. It was a bloody rattle snake and you were yelled at for manhandling him! \n\nYeah she owes you a big apology and also needs to take some anger management and parenting classes. She is teaching her kid that he can lie and she will go full nuclear. Rather than teaching her kid about the \u201cboy who cried wolf\u201d.", "NTA.  I had a somewhat similar experience when I was in grad school.  Waiting at a bus stop, and a little boy jumped into the street for his toy\u2026right in front of the bus.  The bus wasn\u2019t going to stop for another 10 feet.  I grabbed him by both shoulders and jumped back, and we both fell onto the sidewalk, but clear of the street and the bus.  His mother was about 30 or 40 feet away, and she ran up and started screaming her head off that I\u2019d attacked her boy.  I suspect she\u2019d have gotten violent with me, if there wasn\u2019t a small group of folks who were helping us up and making sure we were okay.  Someone, maybe bus driver? told her that her boy might\u2019ve been dead instead of having a skinned elbow.  She still didn\u2019t apologize, and just turned her anger on the bus driver, who she accused of trying to kill her boy.  It really was something else.  I left my name and number with the bus driver, in case that woman made a complaint like she threatened, because the driver hadn\u2019t done anything wrong, either.", "NTA.\n\nSo you stop her son from seriously injuring himself and she thinks it's okay to call you screaming\n\nShe started this argument she absolutely should apologise ans so should nephew for 1 endangering himself then 2 lying about you", "Nta. It would only be everyone sucks if you'd be rude the first time. She put you on blast before she knew the whole story, and when she found out, instead of thanking you for saving her brat, she put you on blast again. And because you reacted to that, she put you on blast a 3rd time getting your brother to call you.\n\nSounds like she can't accept being wrong. The apology needs to come from her. If you apologise after that it might help but she can't just demand you apologise after the way she behaved.", "Nta she was clearly very aggressive toward you in the call so just because she was wrong she deserves the apology? Definitely not how the world works. You did the kid a favor there\u2019s nothing for you to be sorry for", "NTA. They should be thanking you.", "NTA.  your SIL needs to apologise, not your brother.  She should actually be thanking you for saving Jack from his own stupidity.", "NTA. \n\nTbh. The nephew owes you an apology too. \n\nFor not telling his mother about the snake.", "NTA.\n\nRattesnake bite treatment/hospitalization/antivenon can cost in the ***hundreds of thousands of dollars.***", "NTA.  Honestly, how do boys live past 13?", "NTA. The important thing is the kid's life, not SIL's feelings.", "NTA. Not gonna lie, I bursted out laughing when your you told the wife to STFU while she demanded an apology.", "NTA.", "NTA, altough rattlesnakes rarely kill, he still could've fucking died. You just saved a kids life and your telling me that she's mad at you for doing just that?", "Nta, your sil shouldn't be coming at you when you potentially saved her sons life, she should be teaching her kid about snakes and how dangerous they can be. Anyone saying etalon needs to remember that he grabbed the kid and put away from a dangerous snake, and that sil came at him twice, I would have told her to stfu aswell", "She\u2019s reaching! You were looking out for her son, I rather you grab him & scold him then him get bitten. NTA", "NTA\nYour SIL or Jack or both are being unreasonable by pushing the issue. You don\u2019t owe your SIL an apology. She should be thanking you for saving her son.", "Leaning NTA, I can\u2019t imagine assuming a friend/family member would purposely hurt my kid. Your SIL should really apologize for how she handled that situation. I\u2019d also probably be pretty pissed if someone told me to STFU so I think that warrants an apology. But either way, you saved her son\u2019s life - she should be the one to approach first. On a side note, I know your nephew\u2019s only 11 but he kind of sounds like a brat.", "ESH but you suck the least. \n\nYour nephew's an 11 yo and like most 11yo doesn't really take danger seriously and wants a cool video to show his friends. Should have listened to you but didn't because he's 11...\n\nSIL should apologize for going into a rage without checking all the facts. Uncalled for given that you saved her son from a rattlesnake attack. \n\nBuuuut STFU is also acting almost as rashly and impulsively as she did given that she was a mom who was upset that her kid was roughly handled. I'm sure the kid didn't want to own up or still didn't think what he did was a big deal so made you out to be really insane and she should have checked with you before flying off the handle but you also could have been gentler with her given that she was a mom who was worried about her kid. \n\nShe def does owe you an apology for flying of the handle but you may also owe at the very least, a bit of empathy for a panicked mom who acted rashly in the moment, and an apology in return might help smooth everything over. I'm sure once the panic subsides the 11yo will be getting punished pretty hard for the stupidity.", "ESH, you could've easily prevented a lot of this by not hanging up the very moment you gave her an explanation on why you grabbed Jack.\n\nJack told his mom that you grabbed him enough to hurt him, to HER, you abused him for no reason. If your son came home stating that his aunt was yanking him around would you be upset?\n\nApologize for being rude and for hurting Jack(even if your intentions were good, if there's enough to leave bruises/marks a simple \"I'm sorry but you could've been sent to the hospital\" would be fine) but she does owe you an apology for how she treated you and Jack needs to apologize for lying.", "ETA everyone needs to apologize. The kid for whatever story he told his mom, the mom for attacking you, you for communication.", "Im gonna say ESH  \n   \nShould she have gotten the whole story from both sides? Yes. But it does sound like you probably talk to her pretty aggressively or at least very negatively considering you dont even care and dont like her anyways. You might have a history of disregarding her and her opinions and so she probably doesnt care to approach you in calmer ways/wasn't surprised by her son telling her how you handled him. You both deserve an apology and probably need to sit down to hash out some differences between ya'll.", "YTA\n\nYou have better vocabulary than that.  You should both apologize or agree to let it pass.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Oh, and thank you for saving your nephew's life.", "Nta I don\u2019t have anything nice to say about her, though.", "ESH you did the right thing by removing your nephew from a potentially life threatening situation. Without actually being there for all of the exchanges between you and your SIL it's hard to pass judgement fairly. However, if what you say is the true way the conversations between you and SIL went it's entirely possible that she would be angry at you regardless of how it went down. That being said, your reaction to your SILs calls and telling her to STFU is also extremely inappropriate and makes you just as big of an asshole as her. You need to learn to communicate better and more appropriately. If you treated her with some level of respect and she still treats you like trash then it's on her. Right now you are both ass hats.", "ESH. \n\nYou're a responsible adult, you should know better than to swear at your SIL, no matter how silly your nephew was.

For starters, telling someone to shut the fuck up it\u2019s just massively disrespectful and overly aggressive. This is your brothers wife. He\u2019s not gonna like you talking to her like that. \n\nAlso, why does Jack owe you an apology?  I understand that you grabbed him for his safety; but obviously he\u2019s going to be irritated.
