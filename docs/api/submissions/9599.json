I think he wanted to get a closeup video of the snake striking. I yelled at him to get away and he told me to hold on. I took him by his arm and pulled him away. He gave me this angry stare. \n\nI told him what the fuck? That snake could kill you. He gave me the silent treatment until his mom picked him up.\n\nThen 20 minutes she called me up in a rage about how I grabbed him and did this and did that and hurt him etc and I'm not his dad.\n\nI asked her if her sweet angel told her about the rattlesnake that he was provoking. She said what snake. I hung up.\n\nShe called up again and said that I still owed her and Jack an apology for handling him. I told her to STFU and check his phone and see if I did any of that stuff as his camera was recording everything.\n\nAn hour later,  my brother called me up and said what Jack did was stupid and he was happy I was there but I still owed his wife an apology for telling her to STFU. I said I'm not apologizing for nothing. At least until she apologizes to me for coming at me sideways twice.

I had a somewhat similar experience when I was in grad school.  Waiting at a bus stop, and a little boy jumped into the street for his toy\u2026right in front of the bus.  The bus wasn\u2019t going to stop for another 10 feet.  I grabbed him by both shoulders and jumped back, and we both fell onto the sidewalk, but clear of the street and the bus.  His mother was about 30 or 40 feet away, and she ran up and started screaming her head off that I\u2019d attacked her boy.  I suspect she\u2019d have gotten violent with me, if there wasn\u2019t a small group of folks who were helping us up and making sure we were okay.  Someone, maybe bus driver? told her that her boy might\u2019ve been dead instead of having a skinned elbow.  She still didn\u2019t apologize, and just turned her anger on the bus driver, who she accused of trying to kill her boy.  It really was something else.  I left my name and number with the bus driver, in case that woman made a complaint like she threatened, because the driver hadn\u2019t done anything wrong, either.", "NTA.\n\nSo you stop her son from seriously injuring himself and she thinks it's okay to call you screaming\n\nShe started this argument she absolutely should apologise ans so should nephew for 1 endangering himself then 2 lying about you", "Nta.

She put you on blast before she knew the whole story, and when she found out, instead of thanking you for saving her brat, she put you on blast again.

If you apologise after that it might help but she can't just demand you apologise after the way she behaved.", "Nta she was clearly very aggressive toward you in the call so just because she was wrong she deserves the apology?

Your SIL should really apologize for how she handled that situation. I\u2019d also probably be pretty pissed if someone told me to STFU so I think that warrants an apology.

Should have listened to you but didn't because he's 11...\n\nSIL should apologize for going into a rage without checking all the facts. Uncalled for given that you saved her son from a rattlesnake attack. \n\nBuuuut STFU is also acting almost as rashly and impulsively as she did given that she was a mom who was upset that her kid was roughly handled. I'm sure the kid didn't want to own up or still didn't think what he did was a big deal so made you out to be really insane and she should have checked with you before flying off the handle but you also could have been gentler with her given that she was a mom who was worried about her kid. \n\nShe def does owe you an apology for flying of the handle but you may also owe at the very least, a bit of empathy for a panicked mom who acted rashly in the moment, and an apology in return might help smooth everything over. I'm sure once the panic subsides the 11yo will be getting punished pretty hard for the stupidity.", "ESH, you could've easily prevented a lot of this by not hanging up the very moment you gave her an explanation on why you grabbed Jack.\n\nJack told his mom that you grabbed him enough to hurt him, to HER, you abused him for no reason. If your son came home stating that his aunt was yanking him around would you be upset?\n\nApologize for being rude and for hurting Jack(even if your intentions were good, if there's enough to leave bruises/marks a simple \"I'm sorry but you could've been sent to the hospital\" would be fine) but she does owe you an apology for how she treated you and Jack needs to apologize for lying.", "ETA everyone needs to apologize. The kid for whatever story he told his mom, the mom for attacking you, you for communication.", "Im gonna say ESH  \n   \nShould she have gotten the whole story from both sides? Yes. But it does sound like you probably talk to her pretty aggressively or at least very negatively considering you dont even care and dont like her anyways. You might have a history of disregarding her and her opinions and so she probably doesnt care to approach you in calmer ways/wasn't surprised by her son telling her how you handled him. You both deserve an apology and probably need to sit down to hash out some differences between ya'll.", "YTA\n\nYou have better vocabulary than that.

Like if a kid says \"uncle grabbed my arm and yanked me around\" wouldn't the obvious next question be what was the context? Who was around? What was happening??

He was home alone and took the dog out to potty, but had his headphones on. A snake was chilling under the porch and he couldnt hear it due to the headphones, so it struck when he went to go back in the house.\n\nHe is alive and well but getting bitten is MUCH more of an involved medical process than I think most people are aware of. I know I wasn't at the time. I just thought you go to the hospital and get your antivenom injection and go about your day. NOPE.\n\nA rattlesnake bite is automatic 3 day MINIMUM stay in an ICU. And only 1 hospital per designated area has antivenom since its a scarce resource. The ambulance took my brother to the closest the one for our area, which was 45 minutes away. Permanent nerve damage can start to set in at around the 2 hour mark. He called 911 right away and then texted the family chat. I called him immediately and he already sounded like he'd hasld several potent alcoholic beverages. Very slurred words and was feeling fuzzy headed. He said later the initial bite almost didn't hurt but it started to burn painfully about 30 seconds after.\n\nSo he gets to the closest hospital with antivenom, and it's not just a poke. Antivenom is done in rounds until you are deemed clear. He had 4 rounds of antivenom total, each round had a base price of about $20,000. According to the hospital staff, many poeple need more than 4 rounds. Depends on the bite. He was also on morphine for the pain. There was more involved care that I'm not remembering now but my brother essentially had a whole team of about 5-6 people just to attend to his bite. Two doctors, a few nurses, and a pharmacist. Part of the process is making sure the antivenom flushes from your system properly after its done its job. He did well enough that he was released on day 4, which was followed by about 5 weeks of follow ups to make sure his body was functioning properly and there wouldn't be any sideways effects that no one caught. My brother said he was anxious while he was in the hospital that at some point they'd tell him his nervous system was damaged or would need to take his leg. And the stress about possible nerve damage lasted for months after.\n\nI'm sure I'm forgetting a few things in there as it's been a few years since he got bitten.
