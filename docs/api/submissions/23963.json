AskAManager.com gets questions like this periodically but it's usually a parent overstepping. In most cases it seems to be undiagnosed or untreated anxiety.

If she asks 1000 times and you cave on 1001, you've just trained her to ask 1000 times. Tell her now that it's off the table going forward and  you'll get off the phone/mute the chat/go home any time she brings it up. And be prepared for her to start testing.

Essentially, the assessment is that if you ask \"why\" 5 times,you will dig deep enough to get to the true underlying reason.  \n\nI bet your sister doesn't even really know why she does this, but it's probably fear that has something to do to insecurity, and wanting to feel like you are safe.

The definition for it is: families where personal boundaries are diffused, sub-systems undifferentiated, and over-concern for others leads to a loss of autonomous development.\n\nThere are different levels of it.
