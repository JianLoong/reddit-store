Or is this is all just stemming from some weird need to tell you how to live your life?", "Full NTA\n\nShe has no business to know what you make, how you make it, she\u2019s not your lawyer, she is being overly controlling and clearly has no boundaries. \n\nIt\u2019s not about keeping the peace OP, it\u2019s about not letting her railroad you. Stand up for yourself, her behaviour is bizarre and shouldn\u2019t be tolerated", "NTA - you are an adult.   You are able to enter into a contract without anyone's approval.  Your sister is overstepping bounds in her insistence to know about your business and she's out of line for trying to bully you into sharing it.", "NTA sounds like a parentified sibling who is now having a hard time letting go and allowing you to be independent.", "Nta. Why does she need it? I might mildly revise my judgment if she\u2019s worried about you signing something with bad terms and has some relevant expertise. But I\u2019ve never shared anything like that with a family member.", "It is stupid, rude, and completely inappropriate...that said, I don't see where you've asked her to explain this compelling need she has regarding your private life.\n\nHonestly...it does sound like your sister has a mental health issue of some sort though I think the answer to that question may be interesting to others here.\n\nAnd BTW...do you really want to keep the peace?  NEVER EVER capitulate to a ridiculous request like this again.", "NTA. You have every right to keep your contract private, as it is a legal document between you and your employer. Your sister has no business demanding to see it, and she is being very controlling and intrusive. You are an adult who can make your own decisions, and you don't owe her any explanation or justification for your choices. You did the right thing by standing up for yourself and setting boundaries with her. She needs to respect your privacy and autonomy, and stop treating you like a child.", "NTA in my book - your sister seems to have too much interest in your life and I think you did the right thing in standing your ground", "NTA.

You'll only need the advanced one ;)", "Is she a lawyer or something?", "Sounds like your sister has a desperate need to feel that she is in control of her life and as an extension of that, your life, probably other family members too.  She has serious issues and needs help.   \n\nNTA", "NTA - a madly clearcut NTA, why does she even need to know? What else does she demand to see?", "NTA- don\u2019t send her another thing about your decisions in your life. She doesn\u2019t need to know your bills, your bank account balances, jobs, or contacts. She is not your mother. You are your own person. She needs to back off. I would go low contact for a while.", "NTA, there\u2019s absolutely no reason to send your job contract to your sister. Is this how she snoops on your salary/wages?", "NTA. Maybe it\u2019s time to put her on an Information Diet. What does she think she can do if you don\u2019t comply?

When I was 22, I was still showing contracts/important docs to my MOTHER. I had signed a few docs that I shouldn't have in the past and felt more comfortable having my mom look things over before I signed them.

I was very bossy with my younger sister because I was Parenta fied and given the job of taking care of her. (My earliest fully formed memory is from when I was just over two years old. My mother would put my sister on my parents' bed and make me sit next to her so I could hold her bottle while my mother got dressed for work in the morning.)\n\nFortunately, my sister told me to back off, and I was only about 10 when she did it.

At OPs age, she is an adult who doesn't have to show it to anyone.", "But OP sends the contract to sis AFTER it is signed.
