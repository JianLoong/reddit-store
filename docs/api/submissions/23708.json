Surely your sister will look at the thoughtfulness of each gift and not the cost.", "NTA- You got her a gift that you knew she would like. Your parents got her gifts like she is still a child. Who gets someone a bear and perfume for an engagement present? If they didn't want to look bad, then maybe they should have gotten gifts that reflect her age.", "NTA and your parents\u2019 gifts were honestly weird for an engagement party. Not re the cost but toys and perfume are sorta random things to give to mark an impending wedding/new chapter. They probably feel like they fumbled the bag (which they did) and are now taking it out on you.", "NTA \u2026 just tell them that you figured they will be spending a lot more money on the wedding \n\nNot something they should be upset about!", "Definitely NTA. You chose a gift your sister would enjoy immensely and appreciate. Not your fault your parents couldn't be bothered to put any effort in if it was that important to them that they give the best gift (which is wtf in itself).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Only thing you could have done is tell your dad about it so he could get her some coffee supplies instead of a teddy bear? Sorry that is just a very random engagement gift.", "NTA.  Its an engagement and your parents bought her a teddy and some perfume?  My mum and dad weren't well off by any chalk of the imagination but mum bought me some really lovely bed linen (that unfortunately my now ex husband got custody of, but apparently is still going strong 25 years later) and my dad (ever practical) got me a new cam belt and 6 months road fund licence for our car.  A coffee machine was the perfect give.  A teddy and some perfume?  Seriously?", "> They said that if I wanted to give her the coffee machine I should have given it to her later on instead of in front of other guests.\n\nThat says it all, OP. They don\u2019t care that you gave your sister a gift she would enjoy. All they care about is their egos. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Anything else would be more expensive than what they got for her.", "NTA I can\u2019t imagine being anything but happy to see my loved one receive a nice gift.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re feeling insecure about your gift, you can sit with your feelings and work it out in a way that doesn\u2019t involve me. It\u2019s not up to me to placate your feelings about some imaginary slight.\u201d\n\nI know it depends on the recipient, but a teddy bear and perfume seem like odd gifts for the occasion. I got my friend\u2019s child the same thing on her birthday per her request.", "NTA.\n\nA bear and a bottle of perfume is a weird engagement gift. Especially from parents.", "They aren't embarrassed because your gift was expensive. They're embarrassed because they know they were cheap buying her presents and your present made it clear. NTA", "NTA. Your parents insecurities are not your problem.", "NTA. Your parents should be more concerned with how their daughter received their gifts than with what anybody looking on thought. The gift is an affirmation of their connection with her and their support for her new stage of life, not a competition or a performance to make them look good in front of friends and family. Congrats to your sister btw :)", "They don't know her like you do, and your gift showed them this clearly. It's their problem, not yours.  The person the gift was for appreciated it and that's all that matters. NTA", "I mean, it's an engagement gift. When I got engaged I didn't get any gifts and I have a great relationship with all my family. Just to say I wouldn't call those gifts cheap and I don't understand why there's a competition at all. My parents wouldn't care if I gave my sister more than they did, they'd think its sweet their children love each other so much.\n\nBut yeah definitely NTA, the parents are being weird", "I thought engagement gifts were for the couple more than the individual, to be honest."]}
