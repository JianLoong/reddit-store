That was definitely a dumb decision! Can't fault you there, OP", "NTA, but she sounds off her rockers.  That is some toxic shit.....blaming you for her decision.  Beware my dude.", "NTA\n\nShe knew the rules but opted to do it anyways. Her fault not yours.", "NTA \n\nYou were right, she timed it wrong", "NTA  \nShe made her decision to get a tattoo in the middle of the trip so she had to live with the consequences of \"sit\\[ting\\] by the pool and drink for most of it.\" Like what were you supposed to do? Not enjoy the trip because she decided to make that choice? I think not.", "NTA. It'd be one thing if she didn't complain about it or about you doing stuff without her. Just a waste of a vacation.", "NTA. You seem to be fairly supportive of her decisions, and didn\u2019t forbid her from getting the tattoo on the fourth day just warned her that it may fuck with what she\u2019ll be able to do on this trip. \n\nI think she may be lashing out because she realized after the fact that you were right, but can\u2019t admit that because she feels she needs to defend her decision.", "Easiest NTA ever. She sounds extremely immature.", "NTA\n\nPoor timing ruined the whole trip.", "NTA her decision her fault. If you went off and had fun that is what you paid for. She is an AH if she expected you to pay all that money so you could sit with her by the pool.", "NTA - She lacked the ability to think through her actions and you both reaped the consequences then she blames you? What part of this is OK?  Of course you are not the AH. It's not about the tattoo it is about her inability to weigh her emotional 'id' against logic.  She lacks personal insight and this will likely happen again.", "I wasn't with you until she started complaining. \n\nNTA. I, too, am very tattoo'ed and I love the experience. The idea of finding a great artist on a vacation sounds wonderful to me; but I also understand that I'm limiting some of MY activities afterwards to keep my tattoos looking they way the artist intended.  I'd have also worked harder to get my ink at the end of the trip (as you suggested) so I didn't limit other folks' fun too. Sounds like you gf expected you to sacrifice your trip activities as well, and that's not fair to you.", "No, you are not an a-hole, and your fianc\u00e9 made a terribly short-sighted decision, and then compounds it with misplacing her anger from herself to you.  Hopefully, this incident represents like a one-time, totally out-of-character incident, and her subsequent angry reaction is the same.  Otherwise, if this is the norm for her, do you really want a lifetime of that?", "Nta, you'd think she would have booked an appointment with this artist before you even got the tickets to go there and would have possibly done it on your last day there.", "NTA. She made an informed decision. She is experienced with the tattoo process and aftercare from getting tattoos previously. She chose to do it anyway. It seems she\u2019s not mad that she got the tattoo and it prevented her from doing things that would get it wet, it appears she\u2019s mad because you didn\u2019t alter your plans with water activities to stay with her out of the water. It seems she expected you to give up those things too in support of her decision. She\u2019s acting entitled and ridiculous. She made her choice. She\u2019s accountable for her decisions and suffered the consequences of her decisions. She\u2019s inappropriately expecting others to accommodate and appease her and accept her decisions when reality is that her decisions shouldn\u2019t force you to give up your ability to do things you want to do on vacation. You have every right to do the things she can\u2019t because she chose to do the tattoo that she knew very well would impact her ability to do things. She doesn\u2019t get it both ways. As for saying it was a dumb idea\u2026 well maybe, but if she was adamant about that tattoo artist and that\u2019s all that was available for time, then she had a valid reason and it was not necessarily a dumb decision, just a difficult situation to be in.", "If it was the artist Whang-Od, I get it. She is not getting any younger. But she shouldn\u2019t have been mad that you continued to enjoy the vacation as planned. NTA", "NTA. Is this what you want the rest of your life to be like?\n\n>So for the rest of our time there she didn't go in the water. She could shower but that was about it.So nothing in the ocean.

That\u2019s what you want in a wife?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t hitch my wagon to her star, but you do you.\n\nI would bet my ass that this is not the first example of extreme selfishness in this relationship.", "NTA She made her bed, now she has to lay in it. She is kinda dumb for choosing to get a tattoo when she did and basically ruining the rest of her vacation, and in a way, yours as well. She should have waited.", "NTA-she's probably regrets her choice after the fact and taking it out on you.", "NTA.", "NTA \nShe is definitely the A for expecting you to change plans because of her decision. She\u2019s had tattoos before so she already knew the no water rule (I\u2019ve got a lot myself) because it\u2019s always part of the after care instructions.", "NTA. Some people seem to have no common sense. Even more stupid when she already has tattoos and knows that a lot of activities can\u2018t be done with a fresh tattoo.", "NTA. She made a silly choice. Could have waited till a couple days before you came home but she dove in early doors and basically vetoed the rest of her holiday.", "NTA  -  I am going to guess you all made plans to do water based activities BEFORE actually going on the vacation? If yes, that makes her decision even worse. Agreed that all people who get tattoos, myself included, know the consequences of water as tattoo is healing, which varies from person to person as well as different parts of the body.\n\nIt sounded like she suffered from a case of instant gratification. She did what she wanted on vacation, so you did as well, especially if it was already planned. It also didn't sound like she was coming up with alternative solutions to what you all could do together. I mean she had all that free time to look something else up. I do hope you get an apology. I am sure showing her infected tattoo pics made her feel dumb, but I do hope she realized it was an unwise decision.", "NTA for your opinion, but you are an AH for telling her when to get the tattoo, even if your logic was correct. She had valid reasons for her choice as well, which you completely ignored. She's the one who made the decision, and she's the one who had to live with the consequences of those choices.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have plenty of tattoos and yeah, her decision to get one at that moment was dumb.

She's embarrassed she wasted her time and money and is taking it out on you.", "NTA. I was expecting a completely different story here. In no way can I picture you as the AH in this situation.", "Who goes to a foreign country and gets a tattoo? \n\nAnd I'm not saying that because it's the Philippines. I would think the same thing if someone from the Philippines came to the US and got a tattoo. \n\nAlso, I wouldn't want a wound to screw up my vacation. \n\nAnd why couldn't she make an appointment with that artist for the last day of her trip? \n\nNTA", "NTA.  Dumb decision.", "NTA\n\nHow can she gave tattoos and not know that she can't go swimming? She should have planned it 4 days before going home.\nJust because she made an unwise decision doesn't mean that you have to give up having fun on Your holiday too.", "If she hadn't get the tattoo, would you guys have spent all 3 weeks in the ocean? She was dumb ofc but it's somewaht of an E-S-H situation when you go to a country without having the slightest interest in its rich history, landscape, culture, etc...", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain here and say ESH, though it might be NTA if more info is provided. \n\nFor one thing, y\u2019all both planned that poorly. The fourth day or a three week vacation was super early for this, but also it would have been risky to plan for availability the last few days. Did you have any idea how easy it was walk in later in the week? Like was this availability rare or typical? Could you have planned every day the last week to check and see if there was availability and been good? (And if so, discussing what your vacation itinerary would look from that point forward.) \n\nThe reasons you might be TA isn\u2019t because you still went scuba diving and snorkeling. My question is - what activities (other than sailing) was she able to do and which ones do y\u2019all do together? How much of the time did you go off on your own? I ask this because she\u2019s making it seem like she spent basically the whole trip at the pool. Maybe there wasn\u2019t much non-ocean stuff to do, maybe she\u2019s exaggerating, or maybe you spent half of the time with her at the pool. Typically when traveling with others, some degree of compromise in choosing activities is involve. So you have every right to choose to leave her at the pool to do your ocean activities when it\u2019s \u201cyour time,\u201d but then also theoretically she should also be able to choose some activities. \n\nShe made a dumb decision, but if you used that as an excuse to essentially plan out the entire trip and say \u201csorry you can\u2019t do this, you made a dumb decision so that\u2019s on you,\u201d then yeah, YTA. \n\nBasically, it all boils down to how much of the vacation you spent together and what percent of each activities you each planned. At the end of the day, it\u2019s still going on vacation with another person where no single person should dictate what the group does. You\u2019re entitled to going on your ocean activities (without complaints from her) when it\u2019s your turn to plan activities, but if you didn\u2019t also do some alternatives with her, then you\u2019re also slightly TA.", "NTA at all.  She's an adult and made a decision.  Sucks she couldn't join you but that's her fault, and you shouldn't stop having your own fun because of her dumb choice.", "NTA. She made a dumb decision. She got a tattoo at the wrong time and couldn't go into the sea. That doesn't mean she has any right to stop you from doing so, you didn't get a tattoo!", "Well if it isn\u2019t the consequences of my own actions\n\nNTA. You decided to enjoy your vacation to the fullest as you should, and in no way are you responsible for her decisions. Did she want you to waste ur time by the pool too? Probably not, she\u2019s just mad at herself for not getting to experience that too, which could of been prevented.", "NTA. I think she\u2019s upset with herself but instead of taking care of her emotions, she projects them onto you.", "She knows how to care for fresh ink! Stupid decision. The infections can be life threatening. (A friend discovered a penicillin allergy.)", "NTA - she needs to be mad at her own choices.    She made the choice knowing it would limit what she could do.    All you did was try to tell her what to watch for.", "NTA", "NTA whatsoever. She\u2019s a grown ass woman that made her own decision to get a tattoo in the middle of a trip despite you telling her how that is a bad idea, I mean she could\u2019ve waited but she didn\u2019t. Her choice. \n\nWhat puts me off is her childish behavior for getting mad at you for wanting enjoy the vacation and her sulking. Very manipulative too. \n\nDo reconsider if this is something you want to deal with long term OP.", "NTA whatsoever.", "It was more than dumb but you were trying to be decent, not that it did you any good. NTA.", "NTA. If it's the tattoo artist I'm thinking of I am extremely envious and would consider an oceanless vacay a small price to pay for the honor. But her decision to forgo ocean activites for this tattoo should not affect you and she's being the ah for making her tat your problem.", "NTA.  That was a terrible choice.  But you probably shouldn't have gone off to do the fin stuff by yourself.  Sometimes our loved ones have twisted logic.", "She's mad that I still went scuba diving and stuff.  That's kind of why I'm not sure.  I probably could have worded it better too.", "She couldn't have waited, that's not how tattoo artists that are worth going to work. The artist only had time for her on the one day.\n\nShe's definitely an asshole for complaining about it and being mad at OP for doing things without her, but it's very clear why she had to do it that day.", "So he should have just stayed with her doing nothing the entire time?", "He shouldn't have to stay behind just because she decided to get a tattoo at the wrong time lmao.", "So because she made a stupid choice even when she knew the consequences OP has to suffer and I\u2019m guessing here just because he\u2019s a man?", "I Aagree OP is NTA but fiancee making a foolish decision should f'up OP's vacation.", "I disagree with him not doing the planned activities. Otherwise I completely agree!", "That was the plan for the holiday right? You didn't just spring on her that you planned to go scuba diving", "Maybe I was a bit harsh.  I still feel it was a bit toxic.  Just keep your eye out my man.  My ex did similar stuff all the time.  It did nothing but get worse.  You are NTA.  She made the decision, ruined your ability to vacation, and made you not only feel selfish but like an a-hole.  Not cool.", "So why can't you be mad that you had to go diving and swimming alone? If I planned a vacation with my partner and then had to do everything alone because of an unnecessary decision by them, I would be really mad. She's deflecting and turning things around, you are the one who got deprived of a couples vacation.", "Yes, but that is toxic (not saying she is generally toxic!) For her to make an illogical decision and then expect you to miss out on experiences because she shot herself in the skin with a tattoo gun, is really immature and selfish. Glad you didn't miss out on what you paid for, her feelings over that belong to her...not you.", "That isn't cool. She choose to get that tattoo and should have gotten it at the end of the holiday so she could still do stuff for most of it.", "Yep you should have told her she made the most stupidest decision she could have made on your vacation and that she deserved to miss out on all the fun!", "That\u2019s fair enough, but then she doesn\u2019t get to strop at her partner because he can still do activities that she has knowingly excluded herself from. \n\nShe can either get the tattoo there and then and not have those activities, or have the activities and miss out on that appointment. She\u2019s engaged and had previous tattoos, so I have to presume she\u2019s a grown woman, but she\u2019s not acting like one.", "Also the silent treatment, very unhealthy", "Right, I agree entirely that she doesn't get to complain after the fact, but it seems a lot of people here don't understand why she didn't just schedule it toward the end of the vacation.", "I mean, I would argue potentially that she could have researched authentic Batok specialists back in her home country for when they returned or perhaps planned ahead before the trip to get a better appointment time, depending on where it was being done I guess and how easy it is to contact them. I\u2019ll admit ignorance here. I have a few tattoos, but I\u2019ve never been to the Phillipines or looked into this kind of tattoo. Maybe I\u2019m off. \n\nMaybe it was a more spur of the moment thing but again- those consequences are hers to deal with."]}
