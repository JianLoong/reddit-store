Her fault not yours.", "NTA \n\nYou were right, she timed it wrong", "NTA  \nShe made her decision to get a tattoo in the middle of the trip so she had to live with the consequences of \"sit\\[ting\\] by the pool and drink for most of it.\" Like what were you supposed to do?

Just a waste of a vacation.", "NTA. You seem to be fairly supportive of her decisions, and didn\u2019t forbid her from getting the tattoo on the fourth day just warned her that it may fuck with what she\u2019ll be able to do on this trip. \n\nI think she may be lashing out because she realized after the fact that you were right, but can\u2019t admit that because she feels she needs to defend her decision.", "Easiest NTA ever.

She is an AH if she expected you to pay all that money so you could sit with her by the pool.", "NTA - She lacked the ability to think through her actions and you both reaped the consequences then she blames you? What part of this is OK?  Of course you are not the AH. It's not about the tattoo it is about her inability to weigh her emotional 'id' against logic.  She lacks personal insight and this will likely happen again.", "I wasn't with you until she started complaining. \n\nNTA. I, too, am very tattoo'ed and I love the experience. The idea of finding a great artist on a vacation sounds wonderful to me; but I also understand that I'm limiting some of MY activities afterwards to keep my tattoos looking they way the artist intended.  I'd have also worked harder to get my ink at the end of the trip (as you suggested) so I didn't limit other folks' fun too. Sounds like you gf expected you to sacrifice your trip activities as well, and that's not fair to you.", "No, you are not an a-hole, and your fianc\u00e9 made a terribly short-sighted decision, and then compounds it with misplacing her anger from herself to you.  Hopefully, this incident represents like a one-time, totally out-of-character incident, and her subsequent angry reaction is the same.  Otherwise, if this is the norm for her, do you really want a lifetime of that?", "Nta, you'd think she would have booked an appointment with this artist before you even got the tickets to go there and would have possibly done it on your last day there.", "NTA. She made an informed decision. She is experienced with the tattoo process and aftercare from getting tattoos previously. She chose to do it anyway. It seems she\u2019s not mad that she got the tattoo and it prevented her from doing things that would get it wet, it appears she\u2019s mad because you didn\u2019t alter your plans with water activities to stay with her out of the water. It seems she expected you to give up those things too in support of her decision. She\u2019s acting entitled and ridiculous. She made her choice. She\u2019s accountable for her decisions and suffered the consequences of her decisions. She\u2019s inappropriately expecting others to accommodate and appease her and accept her decisions when reality is that her decisions shouldn\u2019t force you to give up your ability to do things you want to do on vacation. You have every right to do the things she can\u2019t because she chose to do the tattoo that she knew very well would impact her ability to do things. She doesn\u2019t get it both ways. As for saying it was a dumb idea\u2026 well maybe, but if she was adamant about that tattoo artist and that\u2019s all that was available for time, then she had a valid reason and it was not necessarily a dumb decision, just a difficult situation to be in.", "If it was the artist Whang-Od, I get it.

She is kinda dumb for choosing to get a tattoo when she did and basically ruining the rest of her vacation, and in a way, yours as well. She should have waited.", "NTA-she's probably regrets her choice after the fact and taking it out on you.", "NTA.", "NTA \nShe is definitely the A for expecting you to change plans because of her decision. She\u2019s had tattoos before so she already knew the no water rule (I\u2019ve got a lot myself) because it\u2019s always part of the after care instructions.", "NTA. Some people seem to have no common sense. Even more stupid when she already has tattoos and knows that a lot of activities can\u2018t be done with a fresh tattoo.", "NTA. She made a silly choice. Could have waited till a couple days before you came home but she dove in early doors and basically vetoed the rest of her holiday.", "NTA  -  I am going to guess you all made plans to do water based activities BEFORE actually going on the vacation? If yes, that makes her decision even worse. Agreed that all people who get tattoos, myself included, know the consequences of water as tattoo is healing, which varies from person to person as well as different parts of the body.\n\nIt sounded like she suffered from a case of instant gratification. She did what she wanted on vacation, so you did as well, especially if it was already planned. It also didn't sound like she was coming up with alternative solutions to what you all could do together. I mean she had all that free time to look something else up. I do hope you get an apology. I am sure showing her infected tattoo pics made her feel dumb, but I do hope she realized it was an unwise decision.", "NTA for your opinion, but you are an AH for telling her when to get the tattoo, even if your logic was correct. She had valid reasons for her choice as well, which you completely ignored.

She\u2019s engaged and had previous tattoos, so I have to presume she\u2019s a grown woman, but she\u2019s not acting like one.", "Also the silent treatment, very unhealthy", "Right, I agree entirely that she doesn't get to complain after the fact, but it seems a lot of people here don't understand why she didn't just schedule it toward the end of the vacation.", "I mean, I would argue potentially that she could have researched authentic Batok specialists back in her home country for when they returned or perhaps planned ahead before the trip to get a better appointment time, depending on where it was being done I guess and how easy it is to contact them. I\u2019ll admit ignorance here. I have a few tattoos, but I\u2019ve never been to the Phillipines or looked into this kind of tattoo. Maybe I\u2019m off. \n\nMaybe it was a more spur of the moment thing but again- those consequences are hers to deal with.", "NTA\n\nShe made a foolish decision and then expected you to suffer along with her for it and that's not fair.  If she had accepted that getting the tattoo would ruin her water time without complaint or dragging you into it, that would be different.  That's her right as an adult.  \n\nThe fact that she was then whining about not being able to do these things and then demanding that you opt out too is not okay.  Even worse that she's being upset with you over it.  She needs to learn to be accountable for her own actions.", "NTA. If she wanted the tattoo, okay.  But, she shouldn't have tried to keep you from doing things that she chose not to do. Are you sure you want to be with such a controlling person is a good long-term decision.", "You didn't call her dumb, so I will for you. This clown dumb as fuk. Let her be mad. Let her stay mad. It aint your problem. Don't waste energy for her stupidity.", "NTA", "NTA. When you're right, you're right.", "NTA.", "NTA", "To finish off. I did not say she was dumb. I said she made a dumb decision.\n\nA distinction without a difference. you may not have meant to call HER dumb, but that is nonetheless what she heard.\n\nShe wanted a particular artist, they book up, you know this i'm sure. the day they could take her wasn't up to her, really. that said, she knew the risks and decided the tattoo and artist who did it were more important than the water sports for this trip. I find it hard to believe that she's upset at you about a decision she made fully aware of the drawback. I'm wondering if you made any attempt to do anything that WASN'T water based on this trip, and if she felt like you were doing only water things on purpose to punish her for the tattoo's timing. so...\n\nINFO: did you even try and find anything to do with her that was land based?", "Nta, your fiancee seems impulsive and childish. She could've waiting a week or two but she decided to get tattooed right then and there so now she has to deal with the consequences of that decision.

My ex did similar shit", "NTA. Be careful OP, she is blaming you and angry at you for her own actions. This is obviously not a trait of someone you want to meet. If he actions are what caused her to be miserable then she has no one else to be angry at, and on one owns her pity or sympathy, and you honestly should just tell her that point blank. If she gets mad, she gets mad. Tiptoeing around someone just makes it worse.", "NTA what a dumb decision and then to get mad at you for enjoying your vacation is beyond stupid.", "NTA. I believe that the tattoo that she got was from the last woman of a tribe in the Cordillera Region that does traditional tattoos and if this is correct, the artist is known to have a strict schedule because of her very old age.

I don\u2019t buy it. I think she was too excited to be patient about the tattoo. I have no idea what she thought would happen.

It wasn\u2019t very considerate of her.", "Nta, im a \", tattoo virgin\" but i got some common sense knowing its a bad ides if water activities are involved, not your fault she acted in impulse, you went there to enjoy your time, she didnt, she can suck a lemon with her brand new tattoo", "NTA. You planned this vacation and discussed things you wanted to do that included being in the water. She made her decision to get the tattoo early on knowing the limitations that come with it.

In this case, the consequence was that she couldn't get in the ocean. She knew it. \n\nAnd on the other hand, it made no sense to punish you for that. You could still do all that and it made no sense that you passed on the chance of doing it simply because she couldn't do it.", "NTA but she is for then proceeding to be mad at you for enjoying your vacation", "NTA.", "NTA. You cannot be the AH here trust me. You didn't press on her to do anything, she made the decision herself. I think she's mad at you only bc she knows you were right lmao. You can comfort her by saying that at least she had her dream came true, and that you two can always go on another vacation together to make up for this time. She gonna remembers wasting all the money and the fun every time she looks at that tattoo for soooo long", "NTA, you told her it was a dumb decisions you even gave her examples of WHY it was a dumb decision.  She made it anyways and now she's mad at you for the consequences of her own actions.  Might want to have a long talk about if this is going to be a common theme.  \"Hey I want to put the christmas lights up on the windiest iciest day of the year\"  \"You know that's a really dumb idea right and you're absolutely going to fall off the roof/ladder\"  \"Nah it'll be fine.\"  followed by putting lights up yourself and then being yelled at because they wanted to do it and it was wrong of you to even though they now physically couldn't.  Just the closest example that came to me first.\n\nThis isn't shut down/cancel wedding territory but it is something that warrants severe discussion of if she's going to expect you to not do anything she can't do even if the reason she can't is her own choices.", "NTA, when we went to hawaii, we planned to get tattoos on the second to last day since our last day was just driving around seeing sites before out night flight, for that reason", "NTA.

Sorry she turned vacation into a boring whine fest", "NTA lol she knows she made a dumb decision, that's why she's salty and she's too childish to take responsibility so she's blaming you.  She wanted to get the tattoo, it was crucial and the artist was so amazing that it was worth ignoring you and giving up her trip for? Right?  Then that's the consequences of her choice and she chose to accept them when she chose to ignore you and get that tattoo.

How old is she? 12?", "Gentle ESH, if the situation is what I think it was. \n\nIf the tattoo was from Whang-Od, then yes, that may in fact have been literally the only opportunity she had to get that tattoo. Whang-Od is the *last* living tattoo artist of her traditional style, and 105, almost 106 years old. It was not dumb for your girlfriend to get the tattoo that day if that was the opportunity she had, and it is a big deal to be able to get one.

Chalk that up to you live & you learn.\n\nBut on the other hand, this was something deeply personally meaningful to your fianc\u00e9e, and it's understandable how she could feel it was callous of you to go through with plans that she couldn't participate on. It's very likely not about swimming; the water's not going anywhere. If I were to guess, it's about her feeling alone, bored, and unsupported, while you enjoyed parts of a shared expense you both paid for, which she was barred from after choosing to do something tying to her family & heritage. She may be feeling like her presence, her family, and her heritage are less important to *you* than swimming, you know? It's still salvageable, and this might be a great learning experience when it comes to y'all's communication styles in the future once you talk this out, and can help you both establish healthier expectations for your long term life together. But my impression is that her side has a lot of emotional weight to it.\n\nSo you've gotta figure out how much of this was mutual obliviousness and miscommunication, versus her feeling genuinely hurt by what she may be perceiving from you, and your actions or inaction\u2014 because swimming on its own doesn't make you a dick, but repeatedly doing something you may have already known would hurt your fianc\u00e9e's feelings + excluding her from *sharing* a vacation with you, is going to be a different judgement...

You can go in water to your hearts delight and your tattoo will be fully healed in far less time than standard healing processes.", "NTA, I understand she wanted the tattoo and was afraid to miss the opportunity but that was her decision. If she didn\u2019t think it through or followed your advice its on her. She made a decision, she now must face the consequences or her actions \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nhonestly I wouldn't have seen much issue on either side of the conflict had op's wife not complained or got mad when op did something she couldn't. \n\nI went to florida in October with family and most of us got tattoos together on our first full day. stayed at an air bnb with a pool in the backyard. everyone got tattoos on their arms except for me, I got it on my ankle. everyone else could get in the pool so long as they kept their arm out. I couldn't but I didn't care and didn't complain or get mad that my family went in the pool when I couldn't.\n\ntl;dr based on my own experience op's partner is creating conflict where there isn't or shouldn't be any", "NTA - and if there's ever a next time?  https://www.saniderm.com/collections/newest-products/products/copy-of-saniderm-4-inch-x-4-inch-artist-pack-10-count", "Oohh is the tattoo artist Whang-od? I also want to get a tattoo there \ud83d\ude02 She's the 'last' (but I think she's trying to teach this method to relatives now) and oldest tattoo artist who does \"batok\" tattoo. \n\nAnyway NTA. She knew what she was in for. I get that setting an appointment with Whang-od is difficult so she had to take the available opening but she had no right to get mad at you for enjoying the rest of your vacation", "NTA. If she didn't make you feel bad for trying to enjoy the rest of the vacation and if she didn't complain about the consequences of her choice, she would be ok. But in this instance, your gf is the AH.\n\nAlso I think she might have been scammed. I'm from the Philippines. The famous mambabatok tattoo artist is Whang Od, right? For a long time we were scared that the tradition would die with her because none of her children wanted to take up the mantle. But last news I heard, her *granddaughter* chose to continue the tradition. It was all over the local news because the granddaughter specifically spoke out against Nas Daily trying to scam people using her grandma's name. \n\nAs far as I know, and as far as my research goes, Whang Od has no mambabatok grandson. \n\nhttps://latestchika.com/just-in/2021/08/04/64093/nas-daily-removes-whang-od-masterclass-after-backlash/", "She should\u2019ve bought dermawrap and then she would still be able to do water stuff. Her fault. NTA", "NTA, she's just jealous that you got to experience all these cool life experiences and she didn't get to experience it with you, which could be making her feel guilty too for not thinking about how to tattoo would affect the rest of the trip. It's a consequence of her decision though, and it's unfair of her to assume that you would be okay sacrificing these experiences, when she didn't think of how this would affect your trip. Definitely would suggest a serious conversation about this with her, if she's your fiancee she needs to be willing to compromise the way that you tried to.", "Well you don't seem like the AH. She knew what will happen and is upset it happened. She can have the tattoo but will just suffer the consequences of getting the tattoo. You guys could still enjoy your vacation without getting in the waters. A lot to do besides the beach. But if you want to get in the waters she shouldn't stop you because you aren't the one with a new tattoo done.", "NTA but when you want a tattoo from a certain artist you do it when they have time not on your time.  It sucked for vacation", "NTA. She didn't listen to you, and her choices had consequences. She's being completely irrational. Also, I'm going to assume they don't have second skin there? I have had several tattoos in the past 2 years and usually, I get second skin put on and you can do anything you want immediately after a tattoo while wearing that stuff.\n\nEdit: fix typo", "Nope. That WAS dumb.\n\nDont entertain that shit. I personally wouldnt marry someone who is that childish. Everything THEY decide to do becomes your fault. Every personal shit they got becomes your problem to solve. Zero personal responsibility ever. FML.", " NTA - she saw you having fun and got the ump because she made a bad choice.", "NTA\n\nIt was definitely a dumb or poorly thought through decision to get her tattoo at that specific time during her vacation. I think that she is mostly mad at you because she is deflecting her being mad about herself towards you. I'm pretty sure deep down she knows that she messed up, that she has noone to thank for it but herself, and that you even tried to make her see it beforehand.", "NTA that was a dumb decision lol", "NTA, and you are the one who should be pissed at her for ruining the vacation. That\u2019s so rude of her.", "ESH. I don\u2019t think the way you talked to her about it was effective. If you\u2019d said I respect your choice but I\u2019m setting a boundary that your tattoo choice won\u2019t impact my activity choices for the rest of the trip. That\u2019s a way to approach it where you\u2019re only setting a boundaries around what you will do and not offering a judgement like \u201cdumb\u201d (which is a pretty ableist word\u2026).", "I got a tattoo on vacation. Guess what else I did on that vacation. Scuba dived. But you know why I could scuba dive? Because I planned accordingly and got the tattoo the day before I flew back. This is just being a responsible adult. If she needed to go that day for it, then she should not be mad at you for doing things you wanted to do on your vacation that involve water. Seriously ridiculous of her to think otherwise.\n\nNTA", "I've gone on vacation and did water activities. Only after did I get my tattoo.  Literally just plan accordingly or accept your fate of having to properly care for it during the healing process if you only a certain day works. Don't make it your travel partner(s) issue.", "Yep.\n\nOr she could have said this before the trip:\n\n\"OP I really want to get a special tat on this trip, and I want it from a specific artist, who can only do it on day 4. I won't be able to go scuba diving but I'm OK if you do it, I love you and hope you have fun.\"", "> ou're on a trip together so she wanted to spend time together\n\nMaybe she should have thought of that before getting a tat that stopped her from spending time with normal holiday activities.\n\nOr at least tell OP about this before the trip, then not get mad at him for going scuba diving.", ">So for the rest of our time there she didn't go in the water. She could shower but that was about it. \n\n>So nothing in the ocean. Except for sailing She couldn't snorkel, scuba, parasail, jet ski. Nothing. \n\n>**And she got mad at me if I went.**\n\nThat makes her a total asshole.", "It is dumb when she ruined his holiday as well by getting mad at him if he wanted to do things she couldn't...", "Misery always wants company, and OP wasn't going to provide it.", "You didn\u2019t decide to get the tattoo. If she had asked for your vote, you would have voted no for this exact reason. It\u2019s not like she just had urgent surgery: I might sit out and keep my spouse company if they were recovering from a medical event while we were on vacation. But this was a choice that she made, full knowing the consequences. She ignored your input and then demands you subject yourself the same consequences as her? \n\nThat\u2019s ridiculous. She played a stupid game, and she won a stupid prize.", "I dunno. Vacation is a week or two. Tattoo is forever. \n\nIf that was really her only opportunity to get the exact tattoo she wanted - which will be on her body forever - I get her decision. \n\nThe only issue is her trying to enforce her own tattoo-care restrictions on OP.", "What process?", "This is where the move from Chicago to Australia helps. :P  It almost never gets below freezing where I am - walking distance to the beach - and if it does, it's in the middle of the night!  Sunny winter days are jeans and a t-shirt weather. :)", "yes exactly. and even if he went by himself this still ruins your vacation bc the point of going together is to do stuff together. it was definitely dumb for her to get mad at him bc even if he went he\u2019s still not enjoying it as much", ">  I get her decision.\n\nAnd she should have gotten it too. Instead she complained about not being able to do anything but sit around and drink, even though she was warned numerous times that that would be the case.", "I think calling it a dumb decision is being way too nice. \n\nIt was just a straight up rude, selfish AH decision. \n\nShe ruined both of their vacations, and she didn\u2019t even have the courtesy to apologize for it.", "Yep. Hence the last line of my comment.", "Mostly avoid certain foods like chocolate, eggs, pork... meaning a good chunk of my winter comfort foods would be off limits."]}
