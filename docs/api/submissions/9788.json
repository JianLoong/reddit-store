Just a waste of a vacation.", "NTA. You seem to be fairly supportive of her decisions, and didn\u2019t forbid her from getting the tattoo on the fourth day just warned her that it may fuck with what she\u2019ll be able to do on this trip. \n\nI think she may be lashing out because she realized after the fact that you were right, but can\u2019t admit that because she feels she needs to defend her decision.", "Easiest NTA ever.

She is an AH if she expected you to pay all that money so you could sit with her by the pool.", "NTA - She lacked the ability to think through her actions and you both reaped the consequences then she blames you? What part of this is OK?  Of course you are not the AH. It's not about the tattoo it is about her inability to weigh her emotional 'id' against logic.  She lacks personal insight and this will likely happen again.", "I wasn't with you until she started complaining. \n\nNTA. I, too, am very tattoo'ed and I love the experience. The idea of finding a great artist on a vacation sounds wonderful to me; but I also understand that I'm limiting some of MY activities afterwards to keep my tattoos looking they way the artist intended.  I'd have also worked harder to get my ink at the end of the trip (as you suggested) so I didn't limit other folks' fun too. Sounds like you gf expected you to sacrifice your trip activities as well, and that's not fair to you.", "No, you are not an a-hole, and your fianc\u00e9 made a terribly short-sighted decision, and then compounds it with misplacing her anger from herself to you.  Hopefully, this incident represents like a one-time, totally out-of-character incident, and her subsequent angry reaction is the same.  Otherwise, if this is the norm for her, do you really want a lifetime of that?", "Nta, you'd think she would have booked an appointment with this artist before you even got the tickets to go there and would have possibly done it on your last day there.", "NTA. She made an informed decision. She is experienced with the tattoo process and aftercare from getting tattoos previously. She chose to do it anyway. It seems she\u2019s not mad that she got the tattoo and it prevented her from doing things that would get it wet, it appears she\u2019s mad because you didn\u2019t alter your plans with water activities to stay with her out of the water. It seems she expected you to give up those things too in support of her decision. She\u2019s acting entitled and ridiculous. She made her choice. She\u2019s accountable for her decisions and suffered the consequences of her decisions. She\u2019s inappropriately expecting others to accommodate and appease her and accept her decisions when reality is that her decisions shouldn\u2019t force you to give up your ability to do things you want to do on vacation. You have every right to do the things she can\u2019t because she chose to do the tattoo that she knew very well would impact her ability to do things. She doesn\u2019t get it both ways. As for saying it was a dumb idea\u2026 well maybe, but if she was adamant about that tattoo artist and that\u2019s all that was available for time, then she had a valid reason and it was not necessarily a dumb decision, just a difficult situation to be in.", "If it was the artist Whang-Od, I get it.

She is kinda dumb for choosing to get a tattoo when she did and basically ruining the rest of her vacation, and in a way, yours as well. She should have waited.", "NTA-she's probably regrets her choice after the fact and taking it out on you.", "NTA.", "NTA \nShe is definitely the A for expecting you to change plans because of her decision. She\u2019s had tattoos before so she already knew the no water rule (I\u2019ve got a lot myself) because it\u2019s always part of the after care instructions.", "NTA. Some people seem to have no common sense. Even more stupid when she already has tattoos and knows that a lot of activities can\u2018t be done with a fresh tattoo.", "NTA. She made a silly choice. Could have waited till a couple days before you came home but she dove in early doors and basically vetoed the rest of her holiday.", "NTA  -  I am going to guess you all made plans to do water based activities BEFORE actually going on the vacation? If yes, that makes her decision even worse. Agreed that all people who get tattoos, myself included, know the consequences of water as tattoo is healing, which varies from person to person as well as different parts of the body.\n\nIt sounded like she suffered from a case of instant gratification. She did what she wanted on vacation, so you did as well, especially if it was already planned. It also didn't sound like she was coming up with alternative solutions to what you all could do together. I mean she had all that free time to look something else up. I do hope you get an apology. I am sure showing her infected tattoo pics made her feel dumb, but I do hope she realized it was an unwise decision.", "NTA for your opinion, but you are an AH for telling her when to get the tattoo, even if your logic was correct. She had valid reasons for her choice as well, which you completely ignored.

She\u2019s engaged and had previous tattoos, so I have to presume she\u2019s a grown woman, but she\u2019s not acting like one.", "Also the silent treatment, very unhealthy", "Right, I agree entirely that she doesn't get to complain after the fact, but it seems a lot of people here don't understand why she didn't just schedule it toward the end of the vacation.", "I mean, I would argue potentially that she could have researched authentic Batok specialists back in her home country for when they returned or perhaps planned ahead before the trip to get a better appointment time, depending on where it was being done I guess and how easy it is to contact them. I\u2019ll admit ignorance here. I have a few tattoos, but I\u2019ve never been to the Phillipines or looked into this kind of tattoo. Maybe I\u2019m off. \n\nMaybe it was a more spur of the moment thing but again- those consequences are hers to deal with.", "NTA\n\nShe made a foolish decision and then expected you to suffer along with her for it and that's not fair.  If she had accepted that getting the tattoo would ruin her water time without complaint or dragging you into it, that would be different.  That's her right as an adult.  \n\nThe fact that she was then whining about not being able to do these things and then demanding that you opt out too is not okay.  Even worse that she's being upset with you over it.  She needs to learn to be accountable for her own actions.", "NTA. If she wanted the tattoo, okay.  But, she shouldn't have tried to keep you from doing things that she chose not to do. Are you sure you want to be with such a controlling person is a good long-term decision.", "You didn't call her dumb, so I will for you. This clown dumb as fuk. Let her be mad. Let her stay mad. It aint your problem. Don't waste energy for her stupidity.", "NTA", "NTA. When you're right, you're right.", "NTA.", "NTA", "To finish off. I did not say she was dumb. I said she made a dumb decision.\n\nA distinction without a difference. you may not have meant to call HER dumb, but that is nonetheless what she heard.\n\nShe wanted a particular artist, they book up, you know this i'm sure. the day they could take her wasn't up to her, really. that said, she knew the risks and decided the tattoo and artist who did it were more important than the water sports for this trip. I find it hard to believe that she's upset at you about a decision she made fully aware of the drawback. I'm wondering if you made any attempt to do anything that WASN'T water based on this trip, and if she felt like you were doing only water things on purpose to punish her for the tattoo's timing. so...\n\nINFO: did you even try and find anything to do with her that was land based?", "Nta, your fiancee seems impulsive and childish. She could've waiting a week or two but she decided to get tattooed right then and there so now she has to deal with the consequences of that decision. I hope you still had a good time, even if it pisses her off.", "NTA.

It was absolutely a dumb thing for her to do. How dare you point out when she\u2019s doing something stupid and problematic that negatively affects both of you while you\u2019re on vacation in a foreign country?\n\nShe\u2019s so selfish and unreasonable that she also expected you to miss out on activities because of a mess she created.", "NTA, not being allowed to do shit because your SO made a dumb decision is toxic as shit. My ex did similar shit", "NTA. Be careful OP, she is blaming you and angry at you for her own actions. This is obviously not a trait of someone you want to meet. If he actions are what caused her to be miserable then she has no one else to be angry at, and on one owns her pity or sympathy, and you honestly should just tell her that point blank. If she gets mad, she gets mad. Tiptoeing around someone just makes it worse.", "NTA what a dumb decision and then to get mad at you for enjoying your vacation is beyond stupid.", "NTA. I believe that the tattoo that she got was from the last woman of a tribe in the Cordillera Region that does traditional tattoos and if this is correct, the artist is known to have a strict schedule because of her very old age.

I don\u2019t buy it. I think she was too excited to be patient about the tattoo. I have no idea what she thought would happen.

It wasn\u2019t very considerate of her.", "Nta, im a \", tattoo virgin\" but i got some common sense knowing its a bad ides if water activities are involved, not your fault she acted in impulse, you went there to enjoy your time, she didnt, she can suck a lemon with her brand new tattoo", "NTA. You planned this vacation and discussed things you wanted to do that included being in the water. She made her decision to get the tattoo early on knowing the limitations that come with it. That shouldn\u2019t prevent you from doing what you\u2019d planned for your trip. If she didn\u2019t have fun it\u2019s her own fault.", "NTA. She sounds ridiculous.

In this case, the consequence was that she couldn't get in the ocean. She knew it. \n\nAnd on the other hand, it made no sense to punish you for that. You could still do all that and it made no sense that you passed on the chance of doing it simply because she couldn't do it.", "NTA but she is for then proceeding to be mad at you for enjoying your vacation", "NTA.", "NTA. You cannot be the AH here trust me. You didn't press on her to do anything, she made the decision herself. I think she's mad at you only bc she knows you were right lmao. You can comfort her by saying that at least she had her dream came true, and that you two can always go on another vacation together to make up for this time. She gonna remembers wasting all the money and the fun every time she looks at that tattoo for soooo long", "NTA, you told her it was a dumb decisions you even gave her examples of WHY it was a dumb decision.  She made it anyways and now she's mad at you for the consequences of her own actions.  Might want to have a long talk about if this is going to be a common theme.  \"Hey I want to put the christmas lights up on the windiest iciest day of the year\"  \"You know that's a really dumb idea right and you're absolutely going to fall off the roof/ladder\"  \"Nah it'll be fine.\"  followed by putting lights up yourself and then being yelled at because they wanted to do it and it was wrong of you to even though they now physically couldn't.  Just the closest example that came to me first.\n\nThis isn't shut down/cancel wedding territory but it is something that warrants severe discussion of if she's going to expect you to not do anything she can't do even if the reason she can't is her own choices.", "NTA, when we went to hawaii, we planned to get tattoos on the second to last day since our last day was just driving around seeing sites before out night flight, for that reason", "NTA.

She wanted to get the tattoo, it was crucial and the artist was so amazing that it was worth ignoring you and giving up her trip for? Right?  Then that's the consequences of her choice and she chose to accept them when she chose to ignore you and get that tattoo.

How old is she? 12?", "Gentle ESH, if the situation is what I think it was. \n\nIf the tattoo was from Whang-Od, then yes, that may in fact have been literally the only opportunity she had to get that tattoo. Whang-Od is the *last* living tattoo artist of her traditional style, and 105, almost 106 years old. It was not dumb for your girlfriend to get the tattoo that day if that was the opportunity she had, and it is a big deal to be able to get one.

You are %1000 correct that all the things she couldn't do is because she needed to do it early in the trip for various reasons. Also she's upset she spent all that money to not do anything but she expects you to also not do anything, therefore \"waisting\" more? Did she want both of you to sit by the pool? Wanting to cosplay her parents and needed a second, huh? ESH", "I mean it's not dumb if getting the tattoo done by that artist was worth that much to her. But she didn't accept the consequence of her actions and blamed OP", "Everyone knows you get your vacation tattoo on the last day of vacation", "Even NOT on vacation, I strategically schedule my appointments so they don\u2019t interfere with other things I have going on. Considering this isn\u2019t her first rodeo, it\u2019s pretty shortsighted to assume that your partner is going to want to sit out all the activities because you made a choice.", "With cultural tattoos lots of people of a culture's diaspora will go to the place their family is from to get a tattoo from someone trained in their culture's specific style. It's likely not something she could've done anywhere else.", "OMG!!! You as a man, told a woman someting??? You are such a controlling AH!! Men should respect that women should never be told what to do, even if it is logical. Men like you are the reason why the world is ending. Never, EVER tell a woman something!!!\n\n/s", "Why do you care what they do on holiday? So what if they want to enjoy the ocean.", "It\u2019s a vacation, they can do whatever they want. The Philippines being a series of Islands has a long cultural history with their coastline and water in general", "Um.... She and her decision attempted to dictate what the group did. I'm not understanding why he should be made to suffer through a vacation where he can't do anything because SHE changed the original plan. And her doing so changed the original plan to in her words \" all we can do is sit by the pool and drink\". Those became her only planned activities. This is not an instance of \" broke her leg unexpectedly so we modified our vacation\". This was \" she modified her ability to participate in the vacation fully and expected him to modify his ability in the exact same way and is mad that he isn't\". \nThat's shitty behavior, full stop.", "So her dumb decision not only cost her her fun vacation, you think it should also have cost him his fun vacation?  You think because she did something dumb he specifically asked her not to do for valid reasons, he should have punished with the same consequences she took for herself?  No way.  If that's your expectation for your SO, you are going to be harshly disappointed one day.  We all get to lie in the beds we make.", "She had no business getting mad at you for enjoying your time.", "She made her own bed. She can lie in it by herself. I agree with cracker-jack - red flags everywhere.", "I believe it's absurd of her to think you should suffer with her. Especially after you tried multiple times to get her to wait.", "NTA as those activities packages are usually non refundable and you have to book well in advance or no spots are open during the trip. And there are usually only good snorkeling opportunities on a beach vacation. Who wants to snorkel in a lake near home? \n\nShe knew the risks and had to deal with the consequences. Even if I was ill or injured I\u2019d insist my SO go on his own", "Would it made her feel better if you had missed all of these experiences just because she couldn't do it? \n\nMisery loves company, I guess.", "Do they not have Tegaderm in the Philippines?", "^ This", "I hope they break up before she gets pregnant because she will have a long list of things he\u2019s not allowed to do until the birth and maybe until the child left home"]}
