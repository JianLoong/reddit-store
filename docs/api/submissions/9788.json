Her fault not yours.", "NTA \n\nYou were right, she timed it wrong", "NTA  \nShe made her decision to get a tattoo in the middle of the trip so she had to live with the consequences of \"sit\\[ting\\] by the pool and drink for most of it.\" Like what were you supposed to do?

Just a waste of a vacation.", "NTA. You seem to be fairly supportive of her decisions, and didn\u2019t forbid her from getting the tattoo on the fourth day just warned her that it may fuck with what she\u2019ll be able to do on this trip. \n\nI think she may be lashing out because she realized after the fact that you were right, but can\u2019t admit that because she feels she needs to defend her decision.", "Easiest NTA ever.

She is an AH if she expected you to pay all that money so you could sit with her by the pool.", "NTA - She lacked the ability to think through her actions and you both reaped the consequences then she blames you? What part of this is OK?  Of course you are not the AH. It's not about the tattoo it is about her inability to weigh her emotional 'id' against logic.  She lacks personal insight and this will likely happen again.", "I wasn't with you until she started complaining. \n\nNTA. I, too, am very tattoo'ed and I love the experience. The idea of finding a great artist on a vacation sounds wonderful to me; but I also understand that I'm limiting some of MY activities afterwards to keep my tattoos looking they way the artist intended.  I'd have also worked harder to get my ink at the end of the trip (as you suggested) so I didn't limit other folks' fun too. Sounds like you gf expected you to sacrifice your trip activities as well, and that's not fair to you.", "No, you are not an a-hole, and your fianc\u00e9 made a terribly short-sighted decision, and then compounds it with misplacing her anger from herself to you.  Hopefully, this incident represents like a one-time, totally out-of-character incident, and her subsequent angry reaction is the same.  Otherwise, if this is the norm for her, do you really want a lifetime of that?", "Nta, you'd think she would have booked an appointment with this artist before you even got the tickets to go there and would have possibly done it on your last day there.", "NTA. She made an informed decision. She is experienced with the tattoo process and aftercare from getting tattoos previously. She chose to do it anyway. It seems she\u2019s not mad that she got the tattoo and it prevented her from doing things that would get it wet, it appears she\u2019s mad because you didn\u2019t alter your plans with water activities to stay with her out of the water. It seems she expected you to give up those things too in support of her decision. She\u2019s acting entitled and ridiculous. She made her choice. She\u2019s accountable for her decisions and suffered the consequences of her decisions. She\u2019s inappropriately expecting others to accommodate and appease her and accept her decisions when reality is that her decisions shouldn\u2019t force you to give up your ability to do things you want to do on vacation. You have every right to do the things she can\u2019t because she chose to do the tattoo that she knew very well would impact her ability to do things. She doesn\u2019t get it both ways. As for saying it was a dumb idea\u2026 well maybe, but if she was adamant about that tattoo artist and that\u2019s all that was available for time, then she had a valid reason and it was not necessarily a dumb decision, just a difficult situation to be in.", "If it was the artist Whang-Od, I get it.

She is kinda dumb for choosing to get a tattoo when she did and basically ruining the rest of her vacation, and in a way, yours as well. She should have waited.", "NTA-she's probably regrets her choice after the fact and taking it out on you.", "NTA.", "NTA \nShe is definitely the A for expecting you to change plans because of her decision. She\u2019s had tattoos before so she already knew the no water rule (I\u2019ve got a lot myself) because it\u2019s always part of the after care instructions.", "NTA. Some people seem to have no common sense. Even more stupid when she already has tattoos and knows that a lot of activities can\u2018t be done with a fresh tattoo.", "NTA. She made a silly choice. Could have waited till a couple days before you came home but she dove in early doors and basically vetoed the rest of her holiday.", "NTA  -  I am going to guess you all made plans to do water based activities BEFORE actually going on the vacation? If yes, that makes her decision even worse. Agreed that all people who get tattoos, myself included, know the consequences of water as tattoo is healing, which varies from person to person as well as different parts of the body.\n\nIt sounded like she suffered from a case of instant gratification. She did what she wanted on vacation, so you did as well, especially if it was already planned. It also didn't sound like she was coming up with alternative solutions to what you all could do together. I mean she had all that free time to look something else up. I do hope you get an apology. I am sure showing her infected tattoo pics made her feel dumb, but I do hope she realized it was an unwise decision.", "NTA for your opinion, but you are an AH for telling her when to get the tattoo, even if your logic was correct. She had valid reasons for her choice as well, which you completely ignored.

She\u2019s engaged and had previous tattoos, so I have to presume she\u2019s a grown woman, but she\u2019s not acting like one.", "Also the silent treatment, very unhealthy", "Right, I agree entirely that she doesn't get to complain after the fact, but it seems a lot of people here don't understand why she didn't just schedule it toward the end of the vacation.", "I mean, I would argue potentially that she could have researched authentic Batok specialists back in her home country for when they returned or perhaps planned ahead before the trip to get a better appointment time, depending on where it was being done I guess and how easy it is to contact them. I\u2019ll admit ignorance here. I have a few tattoos, but I\u2019ve never been to the Phillipines or looked into this kind of tattoo. Maybe I\u2019m off. \n\nMaybe it was a more spur of the moment thing but again- those consequences are hers to deal with.", "NTA\n\nShe made a foolish decision and then expected you to suffer along with her for it and that's not fair.  If she had accepted that getting the tattoo would ruin her water time without complaint or dragging you into it, that would be different.  That's her right as an adult.  \n\nThe fact that she was then whining about not being able to do these things and then demanding that you opt out too is not okay.  Even worse that she's being upset with you over it.  She needs to learn to be accountable for her own actions.", "NTA. If she wanted the tattoo, okay.  But, she shouldn't have tried to keep you from doing things that she chose not to do. Are you sure you want to be with such a controlling person is a good long-term decision.", "You didn't call her dumb, so I will for you. This clown dumb as fuk. Let her be mad. Let her stay mad. It aint your problem. Don't waste energy for her stupidity.", "NTA", "NTA. When you're right, you're right.", "NTA.", "NTA", "To finish off. I did not say she was dumb. I said she made a dumb decision.\n\nA distinction without a difference. you may not have meant to call HER dumb, but that is nonetheless what she heard.\n\nShe wanted a particular artist, they book up, you know this i'm sure. the day they could take her wasn't up to her, really. that said, she knew the risks and decided the tattoo and artist who did it were more important than the water sports for this trip. I find it hard to believe that she's upset at you about a decision she made fully aware of the drawback. I'm wondering if you made any attempt to do anything that WASN'T water based on this trip, and if she felt like you were doing only water things on purpose to punish her for the tattoo's timing. so...\n\nINFO: did you even try and find anything to do with her that was land based?", "Nta, your fiancee seems impulsive and childish. She could've waiting a week or two but she decided to get tattooed right then and there so now she has to deal with the consequences of that decision. I hope you still had a good time, even if it pisses her off.", "NTA.

It was absolutely a dumb thing for her to do. How dare you point out when she\u2019s doing something stupid and problematic that negatively affects both of you while you\u2019re on vacation in a foreign country?\n\nShe\u2019s so selfish and unreasonable that she also expected you to miss out on activities because of a mess she created.", "NTA, not being allowed to do shit because your SO made a dumb decision is toxic as shit. My ex did similar shit", "NTA. Be careful OP, she is blaming you and angry at you for her own actions. This is obviously not a trait of someone you want to meet. If he actions are what caused her to be miserable then she has no one else to be angry at, and on one owns her pity or sympathy, and you honestly should just tell her that point blank. If she gets mad, she gets mad. Tiptoeing around someone just makes it worse.", "NTA what a dumb decision and then to get mad at you for enjoying your vacation is beyond stupid.", "NTA. I believe that the tattoo that she got was from the last woman of a tribe in the Cordillera Region that does traditional tattoos and if this is correct, the artist is known to have a strict schedule because of her very old age.

I don\u2019t buy it. I think she was too excited to be patient about the tattoo. I have no idea what she thought would happen. I wouldn\u2019t let my SO\u2019s poor decisions ruin my three week vacation either. It wasn\u2019t very considerate of her.", "Nta, im a \", tattoo virgin\" but i got some common sense knowing its a bad ides if water activities are involved, not your fault she acted in impulse, you went there to enjoy your time, she didnt, she can suck a lemon with her brand new tattoo", "NTA. You planned this vacation and discussed things you wanted to do that included being in the water. She made her decision to get the tattoo early on knowing the limitations that come with it. That shouldn\u2019t prevent you from doing what you\u2019d planned for your trip. If she didn\u2019t have fun it\u2019s her own fault.", "NTA. She sounds ridiculous.

In this case, the consequence was that she couldn't get in the ocean. She knew it. \n\nAnd on the other hand, it made no sense to punish you for that. You could still do all that and it made no sense that you passed on the chance of doing it simply because she couldn't do it.", "NTA but she is for then proceeding to be mad at you for enjoying your vacation", "NTA.", "NTA. You cannot be the AH here trust me. You didn't press on her to do anything, she made the decision herself. I think she's mad at you only bc she knows you were right lmao. You can comfort her by saying that at least she had her dream came true, and that you two can always go on another vacation together to make up for this time. She gonna remembers wasting all the money and the fun every time she looks at that tattoo for soooo long", "NTA, you told her it was a dumb decisions you even gave her examples of WHY it was a dumb decision.  She made it anyways and now she's mad at you for the consequences of her own actions.  Might want to have a long talk about if this is going to be a common theme.  \"Hey I want to put the christmas lights up on the windiest iciest day of the year\"  \"You know that's a really dumb idea right and you're absolutely going to fall off the roof/ladder\"  \"Nah it'll be fine.\"  followed by putting lights up yourself and then being yelled at because they wanted to do it and it was wrong of you to even though they now physically couldn't.  Just the closest example that came to me first.\n\nThis isn't shut down/cancel wedding territory but it is something that warrants severe discussion of if she's going to expect you to not do anything she can't do even if the reason she can't is her own choices.", "NTA, when we went to hawaii, we planned to get tattoos on the second to last day since our last day was just driving around seeing sites before out night flight, for that reason", "NTA.

She wanted to get the tattoo, it was crucial and the artist was so amazing that it was worth ignoring you and giving up her trip for? Right?  Then that's the consequences of her choice and she chose to accept them when she chose to ignore you and get that tattoo.

How old is she? 12?", "Gentle ESH, if the situation is what I think it was. \n\nIf the tattoo was from Whang-Od, then yes, that may in fact have been literally the only opportunity she had to get that tattoo. Whang-Od is the *last* living tattoo artist of her traditional style, and 105, almost 106 years old. It was not dumb for your girlfriend to get the tattoo that day if that was the opportunity she had, and it is a big deal to be able to get one.

You are %1000 correct that all the things she couldn't do is because she needed to do it early in the trip for various reasons.

Chalk that up to you live & you learn.\n\nBut on the other hand, this was something deeply personally meaningful to your fianc\u00e9e, and it's understandable how she could feel it was callous of you to go through with plans that she couldn't participate on. It's very likely not about swimming; the water's not going anywhere. If I were to guess, it's about her feeling alone, bored, and unsupported, while you enjoyed parts of a shared expense you both paid for, which she was barred from after choosing to do something tying to her family & heritage. She may be feeling like her presence, her family, and her heritage are less important to *you* than swimming, you know? It's still salvageable, and this might be a great learning experience when it comes to y'all's communication styles in the future once you talk this out, and can help you both establish healthier expectations for your long term life together. But my impression is that her side has a lot of emotional weight to it.\n\nSo you've gotta figure out how much of this was mutual obliviousness and miscommunication, versus her feeling genuinely hurt by what she may be perceiving from you, and your actions or inaction\u2014 because swimming on its own doesn't make you a dick, but repeatedly doing something you may have already known would hurt your fianc\u00e9e's feelings + excluding her from *sharing* a vacation with you, is going to be a different judgement...

So I get why she wanted it so badly, it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. But she probably should have told you that before you guys decided to book lots of activities in the waters, so you could've done a less risky activity instead or shortened your stay here.

It doesn't sound like she even checked if she could book the tattoo towards the end of the vacation though. It really sounds like her getting the tattoo done in spite of knowing that she'd be excluding both of you from being able to do couples activities was a conscious decision. It's not like she was ignorant, she was told that this would put a wrench in the whole vacation for herself and also unfairly for you. That mixed with drinking the whole vacation away and then blaming you for having the audacity to do those couples activities alone.

I feel like she may have been upset that you kept leaving her. And I don't blame you for enjoying the vacation you both planned together originally, but maybe you both could have talked over and figured out other things you could have done as well.   \nI do hope the rest of the trip was amazing other than that.", "What kind of relationship is this where this is even an issue? You both knew what the plans were, if my partner was going to not be able to go in the ocean for a large portion of the vacation because she wanted to do something that was important to her, I would just accommodate the trip to that. I\u2019ve never had a vacation where going in the ocean was the only activity available or the primary reason I was going. And if it was in your case, we\u2019ll that\u2019s just extremely poor planning on both your parts and ESH. \n\nDid you to not make an itinerary beforehand or plan anything together? Did you just decide to do activities she couldn\u2019t spur of the moment or had you just kept activities that were planned you knew she wouldn\u2019t be able to partake in? Cuz that\u2019s just\u2026spiteful. Like why would you even want to do any of those activities alone? Isn\u2019t the whole point of the vacation to spend time together? Do you even like each other? This is something she really wanted and that was the only time available, what\u2019s so hard about pivoting your plans around that?

(I\u2019m no expert btw and Whang-Od doesn\u2019t have a grandson but it goes to show you that many of these tattoo artists are old and there aren\u2019t many of them left). I also don\u2019t think this is something you can just schedule an appointment for. \n\nFrom that perspective, and the fact that this tattoo is culturally and personally significant to her, I can see her having anxiety about if making \u201cevery effort\u201d to go later in the trip would work. If the artist is busy or sick, then she\u2019s straight out of luck. \n\nObviously it\u2019s unreasonable to expect OP to know all this. His fianc\u00e9 said it had to be this specific artist so that\u2019s probably why, but it sounds like she didn\u2019t explain that to him. Of course, her getting the tattoo early in the vacation doesn\u2019t mean he should miss out on what he prioritized from the vacation and giving people the silent treatment is never okay. Tbh, I would have been hesitant to call the tattoo decision dumb in his position just knowing it\u2019s cultural and personal significance and perceived endangerment of the tradition, but it sounds like he might not have been aware of all of that background. If he thought this was just a typical tattoo in a traditional style that anyone can do, I can see him thinking the decision was dumb. \n\nTbh this makes me want to know what OP and his fianc\u00e9 talked about before the trip. \nLike the fianc\u00e9: my priority is getting this cultural tattoo that several people consider a dying tradition in honor of my grandma. There aren\u2019t many artists who do it with traditional methods, many of them are old and it\u2019s just about luck with getting an appointment\nOP: my priority is enjoying the ocean and beaches \nThem: cool, so how do we make sure we both meet our priorities on this trip", "Completely unfair to expect OP to basically throw away an expensive vacation and miss out on everything they wanted to do because of a decision she made against his recommendation for that very reason.\n\nI truly truly have a rule on holidays (the only exception to which is now my daughter), if we don't agree on what to do we get to do each do our own thing and meet afterwards without trouble.

If she does, then fair enough \u2014 I\u2019m willing to be far more empathetic to her desire to get the tattoo at the expense of enjoying herself on vacation. If her grandmother isn\u2019t from one of the indigenous communities and is simply *from* the Philippines and/or she doesn\u2019t know the deeper meaning of these tattoos, then I\u2019m not sure her decision was based on anything more than a \u201cwant\u201d because these tattoos look cool, or alternatively due to a mistaken belief that batok is significant to Filipino culture at large. \n\nIn any event, even if OP\u2019s girlfriend does carry indigenous heritage and this tattoo was truly super duper important to her, it clearly *wasn\u2019t* as important to her as you\u2019re giving her credit for.
