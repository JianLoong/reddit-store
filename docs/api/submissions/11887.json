You don't owe him a spare key and you are right, it is your space. Therefore you can decide how often he comes over, etc. TBH, he sounds pretty immature for a 26 year old and needs to grow up", "Nta, your space is yours, that's what's great about growing up.", "\"I just don't see why he needs to come over all the time and not contribute.\" That one seems kinda obvious. It's not time to move in together yet, by your own admission so he's stuck living with parents. He feels freer at your place NOT under their roof and he can't afford his own place. So he's using you for the freedom. \n\nI would give myself at least 2 or 3 days a week when he can't come over -- and definitely do not give him a key. I would do that to remind him he doesn't live there and to make sure he's not taking advantage and / or setting a pattern of moving from parents taking care of him to you taking care of him. \n\nScheduling appointments? He can't schedule his own appointments? It sounds like there is some growing up that needs to be done.", "NTA, \n\n>we decided it was too early to move in together.\n\nIf he wants to move in then that warrants a conversation and an agreement on the division of labor and splitting of bills at a minimum. Just spending all his time there and not contributing makes him a mooch.", "NTA.\n\nIf he doesn't want to live with his parents, he can move to his own place and not expect you to house him for free all the time.\n\nAlso, if you consider moving in with him in the future, I would consider requiring him to live on his own for a while first.

Youre right for declining getting him a key cut.", "NTA. He's mooching. He's getting a taste of the best life - no responsibility independence at your expense. You're right to keep him at bay. He needs to be an adult paying his own way and making his own appointments which, WOW...really? He's 26 and mommy still needs to help him?? That's a massive red flag flappin' in the breeze.\n\nBoundaries, boundaries, boundaries. If he's pushing them now, it only gets worse later.

It\u2019s your place, you get to set any and all boundaries. Don\u2019t let him pressure you into moving the relationship forward too quickly, that won\u2019t work out for anyone.

Age difference was basically the same as well. \n\nThese boys, because they aren\u2019t men, are not independent and really do cling on to women who bring stability.

If you were the male and he the female, I'd give the same advice.\n\nPeople need to have some level of independence in their life.  You don't want some person (man or woman) moving in with you who has never demonstrated an ability to survive as an adult in the real world.  I personally would never consider living with or marrying someone who has not survived 1-2 years on their own.  Some cultures prevent this, but most don't.\n\nOtherwise - you're going to end up being his caregiver and will eventually post on here, \"AITA for insisting my baby daddy get a job.\"", "NTA.

My oldest started at 17 because he wanted to, even filed his own taxes.", "NTA\n\nSounds like he's trying to start staying there most of the time rather than be at mom and dad's, but without being responsible for any rent and bills.\n\nThe fact that he is not taking any steps to make himself independent and look for his own place, is still financially dependent on his parents, and relies on his parents to schedule his parents are all warning signs that you are dealing with someone who still has a child's mentality, not a man's. Seriously think about this relationship, because if you continue it without him first having a period of true independence where he is financially on his own, lives on his own, takes care of all his bills, scheduling and everything else on his own, he will likely just be jumping from mommy's house to yours, and expect you to take over all the tasks she used to do, rather than standing on his own two feet.", "A 25 y/o dating a 19 y/o is kinda creepy.

Meanwhile, he\u2019s trying to see if he can start living off of your hard work instead of his parents, when you\u2019re a good amount younger than him and people are rarely self sufficient at your age.\n\nETA INFO: does he have a job or any income?", "NTA. For all the reasons everyone has said. He sounds like a red flag honestly.\n\nYou should set a boundary of him spending max 1 night a week at your place. I would be very uncomfortable with the situation he seems to want, which is him basically living at your apartment but not being responsible for any part of it ie the cost, cleaning, cooking etc.", "NTA.  Would your lease even allow a guest to spend that much time there?  Regardless of the answer, if it were me and I wanted to shut down the conversation, I\u2019d just tell him that it\u2019s prohibited by the lease and the discussion is over.", "NTA. Your space.

Because that\u2019s what will happen if you allow this to continue. Also, giving someone access to your apartment without their being on the lease is usually a huge no-no from the landlord\u2019s perspective.
