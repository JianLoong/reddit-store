We raise a flock of chickens and several goats. So naturally we eat a lot of eggs and goat milk.

I have Crohn's and totally get being immune compromised, so I was careful to have my kitchen super clean when I was cooking. I made sure there were no allergies (again I have Crohn's so I get food sensitivities). I made a goat's cheese quiche, bacon, biscuits, and a few other things. \n\nFast forward to day of everything goes Great. 8yod pipes up that she helped make the cheese. BIL's sister said \"surely you didn't make the cheese!\" I assured her I helped, it's totally safe. She begins panicking and says she can't have unpasteurized milk. I told her the type of cheese I made is totally cooked and the milk is effectively pasteurized, especially with it then being baked. I had specifically bought cows milk from the store to serve with breakfast because it was pasteurized but figured my cheese was safe. BIL says it was totally inappropriate and I'm a jerk for not knowing she needed everything pasteurized. I said everything comes from our goats and chickens and that cooking it thoroughly will kill off any pathogens. BIL's sis then gets upset when she realizes the eggs weren't from the store. Apparently all homegrown eggs have salmonella, she says... Again nothing raw was on the table except for fruit. I apologized for not realizing she was uncomfortable with home raised dairy and eggs and got called several curse words to my face. \n\nEverything was eaten at this point.

Of course we try to remember, especially for allergies, but it isn't always possible. You did the best you could, and were undeserving of their anger.", "NTA.\n\nYou served cooked eggs and cooked cheese. As long as the quiche was cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees or beyond, it was safe to eat, even for a cancer patient. The ingredients you used only posed danger if they weren't cooked enough.", "NTA I have a small ranch of rare poultry. I don\u2019t refrigerate my eggs. In Europe eggs aren\u2019t refrigerated. I do keep them on the cooler side, and of course, I don\u2019t have tons sitting out indefinitely.", "NTA. More importantly, when is the next breakfast event so I can put it in my calendar?", "NTA. It's on the person with the food restrictions to communicate their needs so that appropriate choices can be made. In this case, the chemo patient and your BIL should have communicated her situation to you, or at least asked about the food before consuming it. How could you even know she has dietary restrictions without someone opening a conversation about it?", "NTA. If you have a health issue or dietary restrictions, bring your own food or mention it before hand to see if the host can even accommodate. \nYou can get salmonella from store bought eggs too, and cooking does kill the pathogens. She\u2019s nervous and stressed from her condition but she clearly over reacted and took it out on you.", "NTA\n\nAlso, I question their sources", "NTA. As a cancer survivor (breast and cervix 8 years apart..chemo and radiation therapy)...I have never refrigerated my  eggs (no...don't even go there boys!!) And I see nothing wrong with your quiche.

They went overboard by not telling you exactly what protocol they expected, albeit ridiculous expectations. \n\n. your system is either compromised or it isn't...a meal or two is not going to change that.", "NTA. Before they came to eat would have been a good time to inform you about dietary requirements. Also the points they made are just inaccurate?", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s under stress and overreacting.

Also, you\u2019ve inspired me to make goat cheese quiche now.\n\nEdit: after a bit of consideration, I changed my vote from \u201cno ah here\u201d because they were rude for their behavior as well as wrong.

Cooking to a proper temperature also pasteurizes milk. \n\nShe need to apologize and so does BIL. They were exceptionally rude and uneducated. You are more likely to get salmonella from store bought eggs than home raised. \n\nI have chickens and trade eggs for goat milk/cheese. Usually everyone is thrilled because it tastes so much better than store bought. \n\nYou did nothing wrong. You were a thoughtful and courteous host.", "NTA\n\nBIL and wife are under a lot of stress and didn\u2019t effectively communicate. It\u2019s unlikely they will apologize so if you want to continue the relationship you might have to bite the bullet in the short term but comun\u00edcate with your husband how they lacked proper communication and over reacted.", "NTA they know you raise chickens. It sounds like this isn't the first homemade breakfast for BIL either. They told you she was coming but didn't say anything knowing you would use eggs from your chickens like always.

Probably also doesn\u2019t even know what pasteurized means or what it does.", "NTA at all. I totally understand that SIL is very nervous, but if you literally cooked everything thoroughly, then where is the problem? Maybe you could have gotten cheese from a store for this occasion, but if you heated the goat milk AND baked it, idk how it would still be dangerous.

And all around fresh. \n\nAnd looking at the eggs sold in supermarkets here, they are not refrigerated, just on a normal shelf. Sometimes even with feathers and shit on them, not washed at all. And still absolutely safe for eating.", "NTA if dietary requirements are that important to them they should inform people what they cannot eat before hand.", "NTA You should have been informed of any dietary restrictions. They should not have assumed you would know what these restrictions are. None of this is your fault. They are AHs for blaming you when it is up to them to ensure their dietary needs are met.", "NTA - They knew you live on a homestead and raise animals for milk and eggs. Expecting you to purchase products you produce yourself without making that expectation known to you is unreasonable. At the same time, their ignorance about food production in general is their problem, not yours. While products made with eggs (in the US) have to be pasteurized, cartons of whole eggs do not, and typically aren't, and fresh eggs with intact shell and bloom do not need to be refrigerated. \n\nFurthermore, according to your post and comments, you prepared all the food in a safe way, everything was effectively pasteurized in the end, and this meal would be no more a risk to her than if the ingredients were purchased from a grocery store. While her anxiety surrounding being immunocompromised is understandable, you did nothing wrong.", "Definitely NTA.\n\nBIL and his sister are the AHs for complaining about your food. What's wrong with simply saying, \"Thank you, but I just don't feel comfortable with what you've prepared.\"?", "NTA\n\nEggs in the US don't really need to be refrigerated unless you're buying mass-ag eggs at the supermarket or you keep your eggs around a long time. And these were all properly cooked.\n\nIf someone has special sensitivities then they need to let the host know in advance.", "NTA. They clearly don't under the meaning of any of the words they use. Their dr told them \"do xyz\" so like robots, they do \"xyz\" without understanding why or what xyz is.", "NTA", "It's really on the person with the allergy/issue to tell you what their specifications are. Are you just supposed to know?", "NAH I can understand her assumption that food bought from a store is the default, however you live on a homestead with livestock which presumably she knew in advance. Since she knew your lifestyle I think her blame is a bit much, but going through cancer is immensely stressful, scary, and overwhelming so I can't really fault her reaction. If I ate something and was worried it would kill me I would probably freak out too, even if you meant well and it's not really your fault. In the future it might be helpful to provide a disclaimer about your home-produced foods, even if it seems a bit obvious", "ESH. I have been on chemo before. The type of immunocompromised you get from Crohn's disease is NOT the same as the type of immunocompromised you get from chemo. It is profoundly worse for your immune system to be on chemo. If you weren't sure, you should have asked beforehand what her dietary requirements were. You could have put her in the hospital with unpasteurized dairy products. But they also shouldn't have cursed at you. That was rude and unnecessary.", "NAH, under the assumption that you are right about food safety.  Think about being a little forgiving toward the sister.  Chemo is no joke.  Just the side effects from it can cause nausea, which causes dehydration and possible weight loss.  It makes you hypersensitive to anything that would add yet another problem to your long list of problems.  Nobody likes being super vigilant, but that\u2019s life as a chemo patient, zero fun.", "YTA\n\nYou needed to let people know. Especially the person on chemo.\n\nThis is not a common set of dietary restriction that the person would know to notify or ask about.
