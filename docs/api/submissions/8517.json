I told her the type of cheese I made is totally cooked and the milk is effectively pasteurized, especially with it then being baked. I had specifically bought cows milk from the store to serve with breakfast because it was pasteurized but figured my cheese was safe.

It's on the person with the food restrictions to communicate their needs so that appropriate choices can be made.

The type of immunocompromised you get from Crohn's disease is NOT the same as the type of immunocompromised you get from chemo. It is profoundly worse for your immune system to be on chemo.

So, I source my eggs from a local plant nursery that has their own flock on site. Haven't tried the quail eggs yet, though I am told they are far more nutrient dense than the regular ones.\n\nI digress.\n\nI can purchase farm fresh milk from the same plant nursery; it hasn't been pasteurized. Guess what? Grocery store milk gives me diarrhea. The milk from the plant nursery does not. My GI doctor says it's because the pasteurization process removes a great deal of the beneficial bacteria that is good for your gut. I don't know how it works, I just know he's right, because of how it affects my body. And you are right; the cooking process does kill harmful pathogens. Not all, but most.\n\nI am dying. I completely hate that I am at the mercy of my gastric system, because there are so many things I CAN eat while on dialysis that I shy aways from \\*because\\* I know my stomach is a complete asshole. And, being severely immunocompromised, it's not like I can go pound down one of those little Emergence-y cold things when I feel a sniffle coming on. (Because they contain a crap ton of stuff that would send certain electrolyte readings sky high and if that happens, hello heart attack or stroke.) Being a dialysis patient is walking a tight rope daily. And when you fall off that tight rope, the consequences can be dire. (I've had over 8 surgeries in the last year. Just got told yesterday I might be in for another one. Joy. Because that means after, I will be dealing with a gastric system that has near allergic reactions to anesthesia and opioid medications. It's why I use medical marijuana at home for pain management.)\n\nBut, here is what I have learned over the last 7 years since the major trauma to my gut left me on dialysis and with 65% function of my intestinal motility:\n\n1. Movantik sucks. But is a gastric nerves stimulant, so I have to take it.\n2. If I eat anything that is processed, I am going to pay dearly for it.\n3. Making EVERYTHING from scratch made, right down to the condiments, isn't that hard. Time consuming, yes, but not hard. And let me tell you what, homemade ketchup is some darn tasty stuff! Bonus, I can even make a smoky bacon version that will knock your socks off.\n4. High fiber. High fiber. High fiber. Lord above, that is a PITA, because I also have to ensure low potassium, low phosphorus, high calcium, no salt (I do cheat a bit with salt, but I really don't like salt, so not much), and higher iron content. (Because severe anemia is a thing)\n5. Protein intake is EXTREMELY important, because I consistently lose blood. (Gastric bleeding issues. They cannot go in and try to fix it; it would kill me) Which means hard protein sources like meats and eggs. Which, if I am going to get it to stay down, has to be sourced as fresh as possible. Like super fresh. Which means I buy meat from a well established local butcher shop and eggs fresh from the plant nursery. (Because if you do any kind of research at all on what grocery stores do to their meat to make it look \"fresh\", you'd get nauseous.)\n6. Trying to get people to understand that I cannot do \"vegetarian\", \"Vegan\" or even \"keto\" sets my teeth on edge. I had no less than 12 outside nutritionists try to convice me to go vegan, vegetarian and try keto. If I was to do that, I would be dead within about 12 DAYS, maybe less. Veganism and vegetarianism is extremely POISONOUS to a dialysis patient. And trying to initialize the keto process in a dialysis patient is dangerous, especially if they have hypoglycemia!\n7. Store bought nutrition drinks are extremely UNHEALTHY. Prescription nutrition drinks are marginally better, depending on which ones and for which specific illness that causes lack of appetite. But they are expensive. NEPRO, one of the better ones out there, is $250 to $350 per case and isn't covered by most insurance. If it is, it is classed as a Tier 5 prescription.  So, I spent about 6 months doing hard research and found a plant based protein powder to make my own for days when I absolutely cannot hold down solid foods or need to be on a gastric rest diet for a few days. (Colitis sucks)\n8. Last but not least, exercise is extremely important. So, my butt has to walk between 4 and 6 miles a day. You realize how exhausted I am to begin with as a dialysis patient? Like, I just want to go crawl into bed and stick my head under a pillow, not go get dragged all over the neighborhood by an insane Husky. But, I go walk my butt off because I know if I don't, my gastric system will be an asshole and I will wind up with a blockage again. (No thank you.)\n\nI am not sure where your SIL is getting her information. However, she has a greater chance of contracting salmonella from grocery store eggs, listeria from grocery store greens and a whole crap ton of other stuff from grocery store items that a normal healthy person's system would not even register, but a cancer patient or myself would get laid up in bed over. And if she is getting these half-baked ideas from her friends and her own family or even the internet, I predict that she is going to decline pretty darned fast for NOT listening to her Oncologist and/or her GP.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. In fact, heck, I want to come over to your house for breakfast now myself! I'd bring some of my homemade multigrain bread for the toast and some elderberry syrup out of my own brewing batch for the tea. Probably go bug the dude I get fresh honey from, too, for a fresh 1lb jar for you to enjoy. Or break out a jar of some awesome jam I just got gifted with, fresh made.\n\nPeople have NO IDEA just how badly our food supply has been compromised over the last few decades.\n\nAlso, where the heckin heck was your husband during all of this!?! Like, why did he allow them to disrespect you like that!?! I'd tell them to go pound sand and then tell your husband he needs to shut that down.\n\nGood luck hon.", "I grew up on a farm and ate the eggs from our chickens.

Longer aging definitely stops the problem, so cheeses like Parmigiano-Reggiano are legal.) \n\n(Unrefrigerated eggs that have not been washed and have subsequently been cooked are fine, as long as they're not undercooked/runny.

Our immune systems are compromised because of treatments, so much so that we have to change our *entire lives*.

Meningitis is already pretty deadly too, you go from \"feeling a bit off\" to \"dead\" in less than 24 hours. Cut that time in half for me. It's so dangerous that I have to check my body temperature twice a day, and if I am EVER above 101F/38.3C then I have to IMMEDIATELY go to the ER, because if I try to 'wait and get better' and it's an infection then waiting could literally kill me.

You may have been making this cheese for years and never gotten sick, but you have the immune system of a perfectly healthy person and if there has been a small amount of bacteria left behind then your gut would have handled it just fine.
