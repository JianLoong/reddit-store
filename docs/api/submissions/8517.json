I told her the type of cheese I made is totally cooked and the milk is effectively pasteurized, especially with it then being baked. I had specifically bought cows milk from the store to serve with breakfast because it was pasteurized but figured my cheese was safe. BIL says it was totally inappropriate and I'm a jerk for not knowing she needed everything pasteurized. I said everything comes from our goats and chickens and that cooking it thoroughly will kill off any pathogens. BIL's sis then gets upset when she realizes the eggs weren't from the store. Apparently all homegrown eggs have salmonella, she says... Again nothing raw was on the table except for fruit. I apologized for not realizing she was uncomfortable with home raised dairy and eggs and got called several curse words to my face. \n\nEverything was eaten at this point.

The type of immunocompromised you get from Crohn's disease is NOT the same as the type of immunocompromised you get from chemo. It is profoundly worse for your immune system to be on chemo.

Guess what? Grocery store milk gives me diarrhea. The milk from the plant nursery does not. My GI doctor says it's because the pasteurization process removes a great deal of the beneficial bacteria that is good for your gut. I don't know how it works, I just know he's right, because of how it affects my body. And you are right; the cooking process does kill harmful pathogens. Not all, but most.\n\nI am dying. I completely hate that I am at the mercy of my gastric system, because there are so many things I CAN eat while on dialysis that I shy aways from \\*because\\* I know my stomach is a complete asshole. And, being severely immunocompromised, it's not like I can go pound down one of those little Emergence-y cold things when I feel a sniffle coming on. (Because they contain a crap ton of stuff that would send certain electrolyte readings sky high and if that happens, hello heart attack or stroke.) Being a dialysis patient is walking a tight rope daily. And when you fall off that tight rope, the consequences can be dire. (I've had over 8 surgeries in the last year. Just got told yesterday I might be in for another one. Joy. Because that means after, I will be dealing with a gastric system that has near allergic reactions to anesthesia and opioid medications. It's why I use medical marijuana at home for pain management.)\n\nBut, here is what I have learned over the last 7 years since the major trauma to my gut left me on dialysis and with 65% function of my intestinal motility:\n\n1. Movantik sucks. But is a gastric nerves stimulant, so I have to take it.\n2. If I eat anything that is processed, I am going to pay dearly for it.\n3. Making EVERYTHING from scratch made, right down to the condiments, isn't that hard. Time consuming, yes, but not hard. And let me tell you what, homemade ketchup is some darn tasty stuff! Bonus, I can even make a smoky bacon version that will knock your socks off.\n4. High fiber. High fiber. High fiber. Lord above, that is a PITA, because I also have to ensure low potassium, low phosphorus, high calcium, no salt (I do cheat a bit with salt, but I really don't like salt, so not much), and higher iron content. (Because severe anemia is a thing)\n5. Protein intake is EXTREMELY important, because I consistently lose blood. (Gastric bleeding issues. They cannot go in and try to fix it; it would kill me) Which means hard protein sources like meats and eggs. Which, if I am going to get it to stay down, has to be sourced as fresh as possible. Like super fresh. Which means I buy meat from a well established local butcher shop and eggs fresh from the plant nursery. (Because if you do any kind of research at all on what grocery stores do to their meat to make it look \"fresh\", you'd get nauseous.)\n6. Trying to get people to understand that I cannot do \"vegetarian\", \"Vegan\" or even \"keto\" sets my teeth on edge. I had no less than 12 outside nutritionists try to convice me to go vegan, vegetarian and try keto. If I was to do that, I would be dead within about 12 DAYS, maybe less. Veganism and vegetarianism is extremely POISONOUS to a dialysis patient. And trying to initialize the keto process in a dialysis patient is dangerous, especially if they have hypoglycemia!\n7. Store bought nutrition drinks are extremely UNHEALTHY. Prescription nutrition drinks are marginally better, depending on which ones and for which specific illness that causes lack of appetite. But they are expensive. NEPRO, one of the better ones out there, is $250 to $350 per case and isn't covered by most insurance. If it is, it is classed as a Tier 5 prescription.  So, I spent about 6 months doing hard research and found a plant based protein powder to make my own for days when I absolutely cannot hold down solid foods or need to be on a gastric rest diet for a few days. (Colitis sucks)\n8. Last but not least, exercise is extremely important. So, my butt has to walk between 4 and 6 miles a day. You realize how exhausted I am to begin with as a dialysis patient? Like, I just want to go crawl into bed and stick my head under a pillow, not go get dragged all over the neighborhood by an insane Husky. But, I go walk my butt off because I know if I don't, my gastric system will be an asshole and I will wind up with a blockage again. (No thank you.)\n\nI am not sure where your SIL is getting her information. However, she has a greater chance of contracting salmonella from grocery store eggs, listeria from grocery store greens and a whole crap ton of other stuff from grocery store items that a normal healthy person's system would not even register, but a cancer patient or myself would get laid up in bed over. And if she is getting these half-baked ideas from her friends and her own family or even the internet, I predict that she is going to decline pretty darned fast for NOT listening to her Oncologist and/or her GP.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. In fact, heck, I want to come over to your house for breakfast now myself! I'd bring some of my homemade multigrain bread for the toast and some elderberry syrup out of my own brewing batch for the tea. Probably go bug the dude I get fresh honey from, too, for a fresh 1lb jar for you to enjoy. Or break out a jar of some awesome jam I just got gifted with, fresh made.\n\nPeople have NO IDEA just how badly our food supply has been compromised over the last few decades.\n\nAlso, where the heckin heck was your husband during all of this!?! Like, why did he allow them to disrespect you like that!?! I'd tell them to go pound sand and then tell your husband he needs to shut that down.\n\nGood luck hon.", "I grew up on a farm and ate the eggs from our chickens.  Didn\u2019t know that all these years I\u2019ve had salmonella/s", "NTA\n\n> I apologized for not realizing she was uncomfortable with home raised dairy and eggs and got called several curse words to my face.\n\nI would never host such rude people again.", "Cooking it later isn't the same as pasturizing it as soon as it it taken from the animal, bacteria will start to grow quickly and can produce enough toxins to make a vulnerable person sick. Cooking it later will kill the bacteria but not destroy the toxins. And eggs can easily contain samonella, the reason countries like the UK don't always refridgerate their eggs is because the chickens are innoculated so the eggs can't have samonella, and the eggs aren't washed which leaves a protective coating on the that inhibits bacterial growth", "NAH - the amount of immunocompromised patients I've seen very ill from consuming unpasteurized food us heartbreaking it is especially true for kambuccha. We articulate this very clearly as it could easily kill a serious patient or wind up in hospital. I know you say you cooked everything properly and that's great to be thorough and I think it's great to want to be homemade. But I don't blame her for being nervous about something she's been advised to watch out for especially given such a serious health diagnosis.", "Absolutely correct. Where I am from we don't refrigerate our eggs, this is because in the US the outside layer of the egg is washed off and this makes it easy for bacteria to get into the egg. Infact it's fairly common for our eggs to have feathers and chicken poop on them from the store.\n\nWhile pasteurized milk is the norm here too, there is a big market for unpasteurized. It is not illegal.\n\nEggs and milk from a well run homestead would be some of the safest you could eat. And that's raw. Cooked there would be no issue at all", "Farm eggs can be left at room temp on the counter for up to 6 months. Its recommended you turn/flip them regularly but they are still safe. Its 100% crazy but true. \n\nThere will be degradation in quality, fresh eggs are the best in general buts crazy how long they will last if they not from the American grocery store.", "NTA. Yes, the rude behavior was what put the guests as the AH in this situation.", "But toxins aren't an increased risk for immunocompromised people, they're not handled by the immune system.\n\nAnd even if the eggs had salmonella, which they're less likely to if they're not factory farmed, cooking does resolve that issue.\n\nLiterally every egg the sister has eaten was made safe by cooking and not by pasteurization or merely by being bought from the store.", "If BIL and his sister knew how dangerous unpasteurized food is, they should have communicated this to OP in advance. It's something the patient would know, but they can't assume someone who's cooking for them would automatically be aware of it. OP said she asked about allergies, and that would have been a great time for BIL and sister to mention a food restriction like this.", "Oh wow!! I had forgotten about that. When my mom was going through her chemo I took over cooking duties and it WAS drilled into me about everything must be pasteurized and cleaned and cooked to the point of almost being unrecognizable. And this was almost 40 years ago. NAH is my vote.", "I live in an area where raw milk is legal. the farmers all swear that it's totally fine.\n\nthere are **regular** outbreaks of illness from unpasteurized milk, usually Listeria, sometimes campylobacter. It's completely false that it's safe for anyone with a compromised immune system. If you don't believe me, you can check the CDC for data on raw milk outbreaks (they track it) or even just Google. \n\nI don't know if there's solid info on homemade cheese that's subsequently cooked--that's another story.  It probably depends on the type of cheese and how it's been aged, if it has. (The FDA controversially bans raw milk cheeses that have not been aged for a minimum amount of time. The issue, as I understand it, is that these cheeses *can* be safe--cheesemakers have demonstrated how--but if you don't do it right, you really can make people sick. Longer aging definitely stops the problem, so cheeses like Parmigiano-Reggiano are legal.) \n\n(Unrefrigerated eggs that have not been washed and have subsequently been cooked are fine, as long as they're not undercooked/runny. Again, if someone is immunocompromised they should not eat undercooked eggs regardless of source.)", "As long as your 'room temp' is truly not too warm, then yes. I gather eggs daily and leave them in a skelter in the kitchen. One summer it got a bit hotter than normal for about a week (we were roasting). And yes, development did begin. So that was fun. Otherwise, i totally leave my eggs out all the time, since they don't have their protective coating washed off.", "When I buy a carton of 10 eggs I keep them in the cupboard for up to a month. They never go off in that time. I haven't tried 6 months, but a few years ago I found back a forgotten egg in my fridge that had been there for a long time, at least half a year. When I cracked it it smelled funny, so I binned it, but it wasn't rotten.", "Fun fact, aged eggs are better for meringues.\n\nAbsolutely unrelated to the topic at hand, but there ya go", "Someone correct me if I'm wrong but isn't this how *every* cheese is made?", "I just imagined there is the idea of setting the milk and eggs out in a literal pasture lmao.", "My mom was given no warnings either. But then when I was in nursing school, we had to remember to teach immunocompromised patients a very long list of things. Things like no undercooked or unpasteurized foods, and to sterilize their tooth brush. So there are definitely guidelines we are supposed to teach every patient, it just doesn't happen. Like patients are supposed to be recieving copius education at their OB appointments, but they show up to be triaged or even worse, induced and know nothing.", "Sigh. Of course. But maybe you don't understand that it's already incredibly stressful to be undergoing literal chemo and it's not unreasonable to ask for precautions to be strict.", "And in this situation, even if warned about the need to pasteurize everything, OP still wouldn't have been in the wrong here as long as it was all cooked. Additionally, BIL and SIL were the AH for cursing at them and calling names. Why did OPs spouse not defend her?", "Absolutely! I would have no idea if it was me. I would just assume organic > store bought.", "The US farming system is very different from those in Europe and Asia. You may have regular outbreaks in your region, have you done a cross reference to other regions to see if the data is the same? If you haven't, I highly recommend you do. Just because you're in the US does not mean what happens in the US applies to the rest of the world.\n\nI'm lactose sensitive in North America. In Europe I have no problems with milk and cheese. There's a lot wrong with our food systems here and if you look outside of the continent it becomes glaringly obvious.", "It's insane that this is getting down voted like this. I swear, Reddit is god-damned ridiculous sometimes.", "My husband\u2019s family are dairy farmers in England, so I\u2019m actually familiar with their system as well. It is legal for farm gate sale only. The Scottish Food Safety Agency even has a page warning about outbreaks from raw milk. \n\nYes, there are problems with the US farming system, but the issues with raw milk are well documented in multiple countries. There\u2019s persistent myths in the US about the safety of raw milk. The places that sell it in the US are not 2,000 cow megafarms. They are small family farms (I live in the Northeast). And they **still** have outbreaks.", "Just washing the eggs with water doesn't remove the protective cuticle, it's the treatment used in the wash that removes it."]}
