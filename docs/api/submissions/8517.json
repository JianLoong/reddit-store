I told her the type of cheese I made is totally cooked and the milk is effectively pasteurized, especially with it then being baked. I had specifically bought cows milk from the store to serve with breakfast because it was pasteurized but figured my cheese was safe. BIL says it was totally inappropriate and I'm a jerk for not knowing she needed everything pasteurized. I said everything comes from our goats and chickens and that cooking it thoroughly will kill off any pathogens. BIL's sis then gets upset when she realizes the eggs weren't from the store. Apparently all homegrown eggs have salmonella, she says... Again nothing raw was on the table except for fruit. I apologized for not realizing she was uncomfortable with home raised dairy and eggs and got called several curse words to my face. \n\nEverything was eaten at this point.

The type of immunocompromised you get from Crohn's disease is NOT the same as the type of immunocompromised you get from chemo. It is profoundly worse for your immune system to be on chemo.

Guess what? Grocery store milk gives me diarrhea. The milk from the plant nursery does not. My GI doctor says it's because the pasteurization process removes a great deal of the beneficial bacteria that is good for your gut. I don't know how it works, I just know he's right, because of how it affects my body. And you are right; the cooking process does kill harmful pathogens. Not all, but most.\n\nI am dying. I completely hate that I am at the mercy of my gastric system, because there are so many things I CAN eat while on dialysis that I shy aways from \\*because\\* I know my stomach is a complete asshole. And, being severely immunocompromised, it's not like I can go pound down one of those little Emergence-y cold things when I feel a sniffle coming on. (Because they contain a crap ton of stuff that would send certain electrolyte readings sky high and if that happens, hello heart attack or stroke.) Being a dialysis patient is walking a tight rope daily. And when you fall off that tight rope, the consequences can be dire. (I've had over 8 surgeries in the last year. Just got told yesterday I might be in for another one. Joy. Because that means after, I will be dealing with a gastric system that has near allergic reactions to anesthesia and opioid medications. It's why I use medical marijuana at home for pain management.)\n\nBut, here is what I have learned over the last 7 years since the major trauma to my gut left me on dialysis and with 65% function of my intestinal motility:\n\n1. Movantik sucks. But is a gastric nerves stimulant, so I have to take it.\n2. If I eat anything that is processed, I am going to pay dearly for it.\n3. Making EVERYTHING from scratch made, right down to the condiments, isn't that hard. Time consuming, yes, but not hard. And let me tell you what, homemade ketchup is some darn tasty stuff! Bonus, I can even make a smoky bacon version that will knock your socks off.\n4. High fiber. High fiber. High fiber. Lord above, that is a PITA, because I also have to ensure low potassium, low phosphorus, high calcium, no salt (I do cheat a bit with salt, but I really don't like salt, so not much), and higher iron content. (Because severe anemia is a thing)\n5. Protein intake is EXTREMELY important, because I consistently lose blood. (Gastric bleeding issues. They cannot go in and try to fix it; it would kill me) Which means hard protein sources like meats and eggs. Which, if I am going to get it to stay down, has to be sourced as fresh as possible. Like super fresh. Which means I buy meat from a well established local butcher shop and eggs fresh from the plant nursery. (Because if you do any kind of research at all on what grocery stores do to their meat to make it look \"fresh\", you'd get nauseous.)\n6. Trying to get people to understand that I cannot do \"vegetarian\", \"Vegan\" or even \"keto\" sets my teeth on edge. I had no less than 12 outside nutritionists try to convice me to go vegan, vegetarian and try keto. If I was to do that, I would be dead within about 12 DAYS, maybe less. Veganism and vegetarianism is extremely POISONOUS to a dialysis patient. And trying to initialize the keto process in a dialysis patient is dangerous, especially if they have hypoglycemia!\n7. Store bought nutrition drinks are extremely UNHEALTHY. Prescription nutrition drinks are marginally better, depending on which ones and for which specific illness that causes lack of appetite. But they are expensive. NEPRO, one of the better ones out there, is $250 to $350 per case and isn't covered by most insurance. If it is, it is classed as a Tier 5 prescription.  So, I spent about 6 months doing hard research and found a plant based protein powder to make my own for days when I absolutely cannot hold down solid foods or need to be on a gastric rest diet for a few days. (Colitis sucks)\n8. Last but not least, exercise is extremely important. So, my butt has to walk between 4 and 6 miles a day. You realize how exhausted I am to begin with as a dialysis patient? Like, I just want to go crawl into bed and stick my head under a pillow, not go get dragged all over the neighborhood by an insane Husky. But, I go walk my butt off because I know if I don't, my gastric system will be an asshole and I will wind up with a blockage again. (No thank you.)\n\nI am not sure where your SIL is getting her information. However, she has a greater chance of contracting salmonella from grocery store eggs, listeria from grocery store greens and a whole crap ton of other stuff from grocery store items that a normal healthy person's system would not even register, but a cancer patient or myself would get laid up in bed over. And if she is getting these half-baked ideas from her friends and her own family or even the internet, I predict that she is going to decline pretty darned fast for NOT listening to her Oncologist and/or her GP.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. In fact, heck, I want to come over to your house for breakfast now myself! I'd bring some of my homemade multigrain bread for the toast and some elderberry syrup out of my own brewing batch for the tea. Probably go bug the dude I get fresh honey from, too, for a fresh 1lb jar for you to enjoy. Or break out a jar of some awesome jam I just got gifted with, fresh made.\n\nPeople have NO IDEA just how badly our food supply has been compromised over the last few decades.\n\nAlso, where the heckin heck was your husband during all of this!?! Like, why did he allow them to disrespect you like that!?! I'd tell them to go pound sand and then tell your husband he needs to shut that down.\n\nGood luck hon.", "I grew up on a farm and ate the eggs from our chickens.

It's completely false that it's safe for anyone with a compromised immune system. If you don't believe me, you can check the CDC for data on raw milk outbreaks (they track it) or even just Google. \n\nI don't know if there's solid info on homemade cheese that's subsequently cooked--that's another story.  It probably depends on the type of cheese and how it's been aged, if it has. (The FDA controversially bans raw milk cheeses that have not been aged for a minimum amount of time. The issue, as I understand it, is that these cheeses *can* be safe--cheesemakers have demonstrated how--but if you don't do it right, you really can make people sick. Longer aging definitely stops the problem, so cheeses like Parmigiano-Reggiano are legal.) \n\n(Unrefrigerated eggs that have not been washed and have subsequently been cooked are fine, as long as they're not undercooked/runny. Again, if someone is immunocompromised they should not eat undercooked eggs regardless of source.)", "As long as your 'room temp' is truly not too warm, then yes.

Also surely BIL knew about the cheese and eggs so could have said himself too.", "I don\u2019t think anyone is the AH in this situation. Maybe OP could have mentioned how the food was prepared before people started eating. Maybe BIL and his sister could have made sure it was ok to eat the food before they started eating it. Put yourself in the sister\u2019s position. She fighting for her life, doing chemo, all during a pandemic she might be at the razors edge, barely keeping it together. Maybe her brother had to do alot of convincing to get her to come to the meal. So to learn that it might not be a safe as they  thought, emotions spilled over, it doesn\u2019t make it ok, but I understand it.", "No it's literally fermenting colonies of live bacteria", "She\u2019s not at higher risk from the toxins due to the immunosuppressant effects of treatment, but due to the effects chemo has on other organs (especially the liver and kidneys), which makes her more vulnerable to severe complications from ingesting toxins produced by food borne pathogens.\n\nChemo is obviously the worst, but nothing immunosuppressant is a walk in the park. They all take a toll on the rest of your body, and many cause lifelong damage. The hope is that the cost to your health is less than what it would be to otherwise go untreated.", "Toxins ARE still an increased risk as they can still cause nausea and vomiting as well as lower your immune system, even without causing a bacterial infection.", "ALL infectious bacteria produce harmful toxins, it's why they make us sick, some produce more than others but they all do it. \n\nNothing you're saying about bacteria is correct except that cooking infected foods doesn't make them safe, and that's only partially true.", "Fascinating. I never would have guessed.", ">Question. If the eggs are not washed and therefore safe to store outside fridge. But there is concern that the egg might have salmonella on the shell.  \n>  \n>Can't you wash them **just** before you use them? So that it won't matter that the shell is porous(for maybe 5 minutes)?    \n>  \n>Asking to understand.", "No not all cheese is aged. Mozzarella, cream cheese, ricotta, & most goat cheeses aren't aged. If it's white & soft it's probably not aged cheese. If you ever go to a restaurant that makes their mozzeralla in house it's going to be served within a few hours.", "> ... it's not unreasonable to ask for precautions to be strict.\n\nWell, that's exactly the problem here.  The patient *didn't* ask.  She apparently expected OP to divine exactly what her restrictions were, which is absolutely unreasonable.", "I\u2019m genuinely sorry that you had so much responsibility and experienced so much loss at a young age. It tugs the heart strings because as mom it would have broken my heart to have unwittingly put that on my child. Hope life has been kinder since and that you feel rightful pride  in yourself.", "OP seemed to have been aware of the pasteurized requirement, but decides that her stuff was ok. Which lakes it a YTA.", "Their ignorance was the only thing dangerous at that table.   \nNTA", "Store bought eggs are MORE likely to have salmonella due to overcrowded conditions the birds live in\n\nThe commerical producers can't do anything to prevent that nor can it be regulated away. Pasteurized eggs aren't the norm and can be a challenge to find.", "Bless your tender little heart. You have no idea what you're talking about.", "Same here, in Europe *and* Asia, no sensitivities at all! But here in the US, everything aggravates my stomach. It is so frustrating.", "Do you know what pasteurization is?\n\nIt's killing pathogens in food by applying heat.\n\nFor dairy and egg products, it's typically done with low heat and a long time, to preserve the structure and not cook the product.\n\nBut cooking works just the same. \n\nAnd milk is even UHT treated sometimes, which takes it *over* boiling for a *very* short time... and also counts as pasteurization.\n\nThe things OP offered *were* pasteurized.", "They're anti-vax and a conspiracy nut \ud83e\udd23 No arguing with them.", "r/confidentlyincorrect", "The UK is no longer part of the European Union and not held by those standards anymore. And my point, is the comment you specifically replied to is not relevant in terms of US CDC and FDA data.", "You would think an anti Vax conspiracy nut would know more about homesteading tho \ud83d\ude02", "You said \"Europe,\" not the EU. Anyway, here's EFSA. \n\n[https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/150113](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/150113)\n\nThey don't have good aggregate data, but it sure looks like outbreaks happen there. Notably they either have less Listeria, or aren't tracking it. \n\nAlso, lactose is lactose. It is one molecule of glucose and one molecule of galactose. If we're going to be precise and specific, let's acknowledge that. It does not change from country to country. There's a protein difference between some breeds of cow, which is why they sell A2 milk here now.", "Just keeeeep moving those goal posts.", "Not necessarily, just more about being concise with data and ensuring points are factual and well researched. But that may just be me", "Brexit completed in 2022, therefore the data still stands.\n\n[https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/articles/raw\\_milk](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/articles/raw_milk)\n\nThere were 26 outbreaks in 2019 and 7 between 2014 and 2017. The UK was still part of the EU back then.\n\nSo, I repeat, you moved your goal posts."]}
