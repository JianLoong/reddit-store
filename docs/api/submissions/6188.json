Cal told me his mom died when he was in kindergarten and I was under the impression it was still just the two of them. But a couple of days ago he was at our house again and a woman came to pick him up with a baby. Cal didn't want to go with her and she was saying she was his parent, he was screaming that she wasn't, so I told her she would need to let me call Cal's dad to confirm. She told me she had the right to take her son. I told her I needed to make sure. She started getting angry, especially when Cal walked away from her and so I called his dad. He confirmed she was his wife. He told me it was okay and he understood. He ended up coming to pick him up since Cal didn't want to go with his stepmom. He seemed to understand at the door but the next day I got calls from both of them saying I should not have refused to let her take him and that I made things worse with Cal who felt he could act like she wasn't a person of authority in his life.\n\nI apologized and said that I had never known she was in his life, or that he had a sibling and I wanted to be safe. She told me I should have taken her word for it and that I knew he had a mom. I mentioned he talked about his mom dying.

How can he expect any other reaction from you than to call him to confirm?", "NTA. Being cautious with the life of a child in your care is never a mistake.

It\u2019s always worth the extra effort to be cautious when kids are involved.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t know the woman existed how were you supposed to react? The kid didn\u2019t want to go, again how were you supposed to react? Clearly, this family has some issues & it pointing the finger at you.

And the gall of Cal\u2019s parents for trying to make you take the blame for their lack of communication and blended family issues. That poor kid is in the midst of a bumpy ride and I\u2019m so sad for him. You did everything right. They are AHs.", "Wtf? NTA.\nEven if you HAD known he has a stepmom, having never met her or seen a picture of her, and with the kid screaming \"she's not my mum\", that would have been the correct response.\nI get that this might play into him not respecting her as a person of authority in his life but the circumstances are on them. How hard would it have been for his dad to text you \"listen, my wife is going to pick him up, this is what she looks like\"?", "NTA. They should have communicated that she would be picking him up. You don't know her, and you can't let some stranger take a kid. You 100% did the right thing in calling the dad and confirming.\n\nThese rules are also applied at kindergartens and daycare. I remember that my parents had to explicitly allow my grandparents and out them on a list for one specific day to pick me up.\n\nTo mey it sounds a lot like the stepmum whined about it to her partner and that's why they both called you the next day.", "I'm sure the step mother made a scene at home and the dad budged.

You were absolutely right to not let Cal go off with a stranger who turned up on your doorstep.\n\nCal's father is the AH here for not mentioning he had a new wife. And judging by Cal's reaction to her, there's obviously tension between them, especially if she's calling herself his parent and calling him her son when he's not. It's up to Cal's dad and stepmum to sort that situation out, not blame their family dysfunction on you. \n\nNo way would I have let some strange woman, whose mere presence was enough to provoke this kind of reaction from a 10 year old, take that child from my house. Your job while Cal is in your care is to make sure he's safe. Cal's parents are wrong to try and fault you for doing what you  were supposed to.", "NTA you did the right thing", "NTA. Cal\u2019s parents have a problem with Cal not you. You were acting responsibly by calling his father. I\u2019m not sure why his father came to get him instead of telling him he had to go with his stepmother. And, I don\u2019t know why both felt a need to place blame on you afterwards. Most likely the stepmother was angry about Cal and her husband undermining her authority, and it was easier to place blame on you rather than where it really belongs. This is a family problem they need to work out.\n\nPS Years ago, a worker at a local school allowed a woman who wasn\u2019t authorized to pick up the child to take them (pick up was in the cafeteria, away from the computers and list of people authorized to pick up kids). She said she was their mother, and the child seemed to know her and went with her willingly. It turned out she was the mother, but there had been problems with her taking the child so the father couldn\u2019t have access to them, thus kidnapping them. She did take the child home that evening and a nightmare was avoided, but the school cracked down on their pickup procedures. You can\u2019t be too careful. You did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nIf the father had told you his wife would be picking Cal up none of this would have happened so it's on them.\n\nDon't schools need to know who's likely to be picking a child up?

There are obviously underlying issues at home here that they both feel you\u2019ve exposed and they\u2019re taking it out on you.  She\u2019s upset at him for never mentioning her existence, and they\u2019re both upset that the son refused to go with her and basically denied her place in his life.", "NTA. You didn't know she existed. There's no way they know what you do or don't know..they aren't you. They should be happy that you refused to let him go with someone he said he didn't know.

This is all on _them_ for 1 for not keeping you in the loop, for 2 for sending the step-\"mom\" to pick up a kid, who is clearly not comfortable with her.", "Definitely NTA for calling dad,  but in my opinion,  once Cal's dad confirmed on the phone, you should have told cal to go with the stepmom.  She is a valid authority figure in his life, whether he likes it or not.", "An stranger shows up at your house wanting to take the kid, the kid screams and refuses to go and they were expecting for you to trust in the stranger and force the kid to go with her? God this people on top on being AH are stupid, poor kid. \nThe kid has been coming to your house for three year, the father should have introduce his partner to you and let you know she'll be picking the kid up too, what he did was unbelievably irresponsible and careless so now he rather blame you than acknowledge he messed up.\nNTA (forgot to put the judgment)", "NTA. Seriously, NTA. You did exactly the right thing not sending a child with a stranger. Look at this from the other side. If she hadn\u2019t been his stepmom but you let him go anyway? Always err on the side of caution.", "NTA. You 100% did the right thing.", "NTA.\n\nAlthough it was pretty obvious what was going on, it was the responsible thing to do just in case this woman was trying to kidnap the kid.", "NTA and sounds like probably abusive home life there", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Especially when he became so defensive toward her. He's such a sweet kid and behaves really well so it was such a stark difference in behavior for him.", "I get where you're coming from but forcing a reluctant child to go with an angry adult  would have raised alarm bells with me. This was probably not the first time Cals refused to go with his father's wife so that's why his dad came to get him. \n\nCal is not the problem, Cal's father has been avoiding a few big problems for way too long.

You absolutely did the right thing", "NTA\n\nAnd, if I could, I would just keep right on saying it. \n\nYou had no idea who this lady was, who suddenly showed up on your porch.

Especially since the boy didn't help by saying she isn't his Mom, which is true but he knew very well what he was implying.\n\nThat's a discussion between the three of them.

You did exactly the right thing to protect a distressed child in your care. Cal's parents acted irresponsibly by not informing you of who was to collect him in the first place. A stranger to you (who you didn't even know existed) came to your house to collect a child & the child denied she was his stepmom, you listen to the child. They're obviously having difficulties as a family, but they didn't tell you that.

Otherwise he'd have had an issue with it at the time.", "NTA you didthe right thing, you had never met this person the child didn't want to go with them and that didn't want you to contact the known parent.  I would speak to the dad again, re explain the situation but add you had never heard of stepmother let alone met her yet they are saying you should have potentially let a kidnapper, abuser or ex girlfriend take a child from your home.  Stepmother was a complete stranger yo you and in a situation like this it would have been appropriate to send you a text letting you know someone new was picking him up preferably with a photo rather than expecting you to take the word of a stranger and potentially put his child at risk.  Honestly what would he done if you had actually let him go and the adult was not meant to be picking the child up?  What they are asking (thats likely driven by stepmother). Goes against every child safty rule out there", "NTA. This really weird they didn't say anything to you about a new wife and baby, and just assumed you'd know.  Even a quick text \"hey,  my wife will be picking him up today\" would have made things 100% easier.", "NTA - you absolutely did everything correctly!

Of course you were concerned!

I genuinely hope that knowing that bring you some peace in this situation.", "Tell her she's lucky you didn't call the police for attempted kidnapping, which was your other option.

This is the dad\u2019s fault for not letting you know someone else would be picking up his kid. Who does that?! It sounds like Cal is struggling to adjust and who can blame him when dad and stepmom are so thoughtless and histrionic.", "Yikes! NTA! If I were this step mom I\u2019d be very concerned that my husband hasn\u2019t mentioned to people that I exist.

No, you absolutely should not trust a random stranger you've never met.", "INFO: Doesn't your daughter know that he has a stepmom (and actually know the stepmom)?", "NTA\nThis was 100% the correct response. It was the safest and most caring way to respond to that situation. If Cal\u2019s dad never told you about the step mom and you\u2019d never met her or the baby, how would you know? Take some rando\u2019s word for it when the kid is claiming she\u2019s not his parent? That\u2019s how kids get kidnapped and the news story would be all about how the friends mom didn\u2019t care to check in that this stranger was a safe person.", "NTA at all!!! Even if you knew he had a stepmom it wouldn\u2019t matter. You had never met her and Cal said he didn\u2019t know her or want to go with her. What really concerns me is Cals reaction, because that is not a normal reaction unless she is mistreating him at home.

I feel for the step mom genuinely, especially if the kid is denying her authority in his life, but that is a family problem and in no way your fault.", "NTA. The fact that Cal was that upset makes me wonder about the stepmom. Not to mention her reaction.", "NTA. Perfectly appropriate response to the situation as described. TBH, if stepmom had a better relationship with Cal, this never would have been an issue. Having never even known of her existence prior to that, it would have been unthinkable to let her take the kid away after his response.", "NTA. Parental kidnapping is a real thing, although in this case it might be step-parental kidnapping. The father of Cal should be thankful you are watching out for his son's safety and welfare. It is completely reasonable you would reject a stranger's attempt to take a child. Even with Cal vetting the woman, the fact Cal did not want to go with her -- regardless of the reason -- provided ample enough reason for you to question her. Calling the boy's father, the one person you do know, was and will always be the correct course of action.

You have been around this kid three years and you have never met the wife or had anyone pick up other than the dad? How long has she even been around?

Wow, stellar parents there! You did the right thing OP, they obviously introduced stepmom and expected that Cal would just accept it all. We will all be reading Cals story here in a few years telling us the story of his awful stepmother who wants to be called mom!", "NTA and honestly their reaction is ridiculous. You did exactly the right thing and if I was Cal\u2019s dad/stepmom, I\u2019d be happy he was being minded by someone careful about his welfare. What else were you supposed to do? The child was crying and not wanting to go with a stranger! Honest to god, the gall of these people.\n\nIt sounds like Cal does not want his mother being replaced, which is obviously understandable and this adjustment to a new parent figure would be hard for him regardless. But this woman sounds awful and like she\u2019s making it even harder for the poor boy, she\u2019s not his mum and so referring to Cal as \u2018her son\u2019 is pretty heartless, no wonder he\u2019s pushing back against her. It sounds like you touched a raw nerve and it\u2019s probably a reoccurring theme in Cal\u2019s home-life, her insisting she\u2019s his \u2018parent\u2019 and him insisting that she isn\u2019t. That\u2019s on her. This little boy has lost his mommy and is dealing with trauma, the only thing she should be doing is recognising with him that she knows she\u2019s not his mother, could never replace her, and gently try to build a happy home, which will take some time and patience. No wonder he doesn\u2019t acknowledge her or the baby, it must be so tough on him having this new family and especially if she and dad are not doing anything to help him adjust. \n\nIt also sounds like she also has a lot of influence on dad, his response was rational at first but then rather than calm his wife down, became just as unhinged. So I doubt he\u2019s taking much handle on understanding his son\u2019s delicate needs and probably is more supportive of his wife\u2019s need to be instantly accepted. Awful. I feel really sorry for the child stuck in the middle, life has not been kind and it\u2019s only getting bumpier.

HUGE RED FLAG", "I'm guessing Dad was in trouble for not mentioning that he was married and had a baby.

They can die mad about it.

You\u2019ve never even met the new wife, so there\u2019s no secret plot to undermine her authority. You also have no reason to lie about whether you knew she existed. \n\nChances are, stepmom assumed either dad or son had talked about her to the people in their lives. It would have been embarrassing to discover on someone\u2019s doorstep that they had no idea you existed, and her response was to get indignant. She may have (acting on emotion instead of logic and reason) assumed that you must be lying, because why wouldn\u2019t you know of her when she\u2019s been in Cal\u2019s life for however long. It would have been a way to protect herself from feeling hurt that he hadn\u2019t talked about her. Judging from the way Cal reacted to her, this is not a new thing in their relationship, but like lots of stepparents she thinks being authoritative and demanding his respect and obedience, she can just force him to accept her. Sadly, it doesn\u2019t work that way. The way Dad was understanding at first and then lashed out later makes me think he got an earful from her and felt backed into a corner to \u201cstand up for her.\u201d\n\nAnyway.
