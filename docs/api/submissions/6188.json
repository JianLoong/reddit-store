Cal told me his mom died when he was in kindergarten and I was under the impression it was still just the two of them. But a couple of days ago he was at our house again and a woman came to pick him up with a baby. Cal didn't want to go with her and she was saying she was his parent, he was screaming that she wasn't, so I told her she would need to let me call Cal's dad to confirm. She told me she had the right to take her son. I told her I needed to make sure. She started getting angry, especially when Cal walked away from her and so I called his dad. He confirmed she was his wife. He told me it was okay and he understood. He ended up coming to pick him up since Cal didn't want to go with his stepmom. He seemed to understand at the door but the next day I got calls from both of them saying I should not have refused to let her take him and that I made things worse with Cal who felt he could act like she wasn't a person of authority in his life.\n\nI apologized and said that I had never known she was in his life, or that he had a sibling and I wanted to be safe. She told me I should have taken her word for it and that I knew he had a mom. I mentioned he talked about his mom dying.

How can he expect any other reaction from you than to call him to confirm?", "NTA. Being cautious with the life of a child in your care is never a mistake.

And the gall of Cal\u2019s parents for trying to make you take the blame for their lack of communication and blended family issues. That poor kid is in the midst of a bumpy ride and I\u2019m so sad for him. You did everything right. They are AHs.", "Wtf? NTA.\nEven if you HAD known he has a stepmom, having never met her or seen a picture of her, and with the kid screaming \"she's not my mum\", that would have been the correct response.\nI get that this might play into him not respecting her as a person of authority in his life but the circumstances are on them. How hard would it have been for his dad to text you \"listen, my wife is going to pick him up, this is what she looks like\"?", "NTA. They should have communicated that she would be picking him up. You don't know her, and you can't let some stranger take a kid. You 100% did the right thing in calling the dad and confirming.\n\nThese rules are also applied at kindergartens and daycare. I remember that my parents had to explicitly allow my grandparents and out them on a list for one specific day to pick me up.\n\nTo mey it sounds a lot like the stepmum whined about it to her partner and that's why they both called you the next day.", "I'm sure the step mother made a scene at home and the dad budged.

You were absolutely right to not let Cal go off with a stranger who turned up on your doorstep.\n\nCal's father is the AH here for not mentioning he had a new wife. And judging by Cal's reaction to her, there's obviously tension between them, especially if she's calling herself his parent and calling him her son when he's not. It's up to Cal's dad and stepmum to sort that situation out, not blame their family dysfunction on you. \n\nNo way would I have let some strange woman, whose mere presence was enough to provoke this kind of reaction from a 10 year old, take that child from my house. Your job while Cal is in your care is to make sure he's safe. Cal's parents are wrong to try and fault you for doing what you  were supposed to.", "NTA you did the right thing", "NTA. Cal\u2019s parents have a problem with Cal not you. You were acting responsibly by calling his father. I\u2019m not sure why his father came to get him instead of telling him he had to go with his stepmother. And, I don\u2019t know why both felt a need to place blame on you afterwards. Most likely the stepmother was angry about Cal and her husband undermining her authority, and it was easier to place blame on you rather than where it really belongs. This is a family problem they need to work out.\n\nPS Years ago, a worker at a local school allowed a woman who wasn\u2019t authorized to pick up the child to take them (pick up was in the cafeteria, away from the computers and list of people authorized to pick up kids). She said she was their mother, and the child seemed to know her and went with her willingly. It turned out she was the mother, but there had been problems with her taking the child so the father couldn\u2019t have access to them, thus kidnapping them. She did take the child home that evening and a nightmare was avoided, but the school cracked down on their pickup procedures. You can\u2019t be too careful. You did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nIf the father had told you his wife would be picking Cal up none of this would have happened so it's on them.\n\nDon't schools need to know who's likely to be picking a child up?

There are obviously underlying issues at home here that they both feel you\u2019ve exposed and they\u2019re taking it out on you.  She\u2019s upset at him for never mentioning her existence, and they\u2019re both upset that the son refused to go with her and basically denied her place in his life.", "NTA. You didn't know she existed. There's no way they know what you do or don't know..they aren't you. They should be happy that you refused to let him go with someone he said he didn't know.

She is a valid authority figure in his life, whether he likes it or not.", "An stranger shows up at your house wanting to take the kid, the kid screams and refuses to go and they were expecting for you to trust in the stranger and force the kid to go with her? God this people on top on being AH are stupid, poor kid. \nThe kid has been coming to your house for three year, the father should have introduce his partner to you and let you know she'll be picking the kid up too, what he did was unbelievably irresponsible and careless so now he rather blame you than acknowledge he messed up.\nNTA (forgot to put the judgment)", "NTA. Seriously, NTA. You did exactly the right thing not sending a child with a stranger. Look at this from the other side. If she hadn\u2019t been his stepmom but you let him go anyway? Always err on the side of caution.", "NTA. You 100% did the right thing.", "NTA.\n\nAlthough it was pretty obvious what was going on, it was the responsible thing to do just in case this woman was trying to kidnap the kid.", "NTA and sounds like probably abusive home life there", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Especially when he became so defensive toward her. He's such a sweet kid and behaves really well so it was such a stark difference in behavior for him.", "I get where you're coming from but forcing a reluctant child to go with an angry adult  would have raised alarm bells with me. This was probably not the first time Cals refused to go with his father's wife so that's why his dad came to get him. \n\nCal is not the problem, Cal's father has been avoiding a few big problems for way too long.

You absolutely did the right thing", "NTA\n\nAnd, if I could, I would just keep right on saying it. \n\nYou had no idea who this lady was, who suddenly showed up on your porch.

Especially since the boy didn't help by saying she isn't his Mom, which is true but he knew very well what he was implying.\n\nThat's a discussion between the three of them.

You did exactly the right thing to protect a distressed child in your care. Cal's parents acted irresponsibly by not informing you of who was to collect him in the first place. A stranger to you (who you didn't even know existed) came to your house to collect a child & the child denied she was his stepmom, you listen to the child. They're obviously having difficulties as a family, but they didn't tell you that.

Otherwise he'd have had an issue with it at the time.", "NTA you didthe right thing, you had never met this person the child didn't want to go with them and that didn't want you to contact the known parent.  I would speak to the dad again, re explain the situation but add you had never heard of stepmother let alone met her yet they are saying you should have potentially let a kidnapper, abuser or ex girlfriend take a child from your home.  Stepmother was a complete stranger yo you and in a situation like this it would have been appropriate to send you a text letting you know someone new was picking him up preferably with a photo rather than expecting you to take the word of a stranger and potentially put his child at risk.  Honestly what would he done if you had actually let him go and the adult was not meant to be picking the child up?  What they are asking (thats likely driven by stepmother). Goes against every child safty rule out there", "NTA. This really weird they didn't say anything to you about a new wife and baby, and just assumed you'd know.  Even a quick text \"hey,  my wife will be picking him up today\" would have made things 100% easier.", "NTA - you absolutely did everything correctly!

Of course you were concerned!

I genuinely hope that knowing that bring you some peace in this situation.", "Tell her she's lucky you didn't call the police for attempted kidnapping, which was your other option.

This is the dad\u2019s fault for not letting you know someone else would be picking up his kid. Who does that?! It sounds like Cal is struggling to adjust and who can blame him when dad and stepmom are so thoughtless and histrionic.", "Yikes! NTA! If I were this step mom I\u2019d be very concerned that my husband hasn\u2019t mentioned to people that I exist.

No, you absolutely should not trust a random stranger you've never met.", "INFO: Doesn't your daughter know that he has a stepmom (and actually know the stepmom)?", "NTA\nThis was 100% the correct response. It was the safest and most caring way to respond to that situation. If Cal\u2019s dad never told you about the step mom and you\u2019d never met her or the baby, how would you know? Take some rando\u2019s word for it when the kid is claiming she\u2019s not his parent? That\u2019s how kids get kidnapped and the news story would be all about how the friends mom didn\u2019t care to check in that this stranger was a safe person.", "NTA at all!!! Even if you knew he had a stepmom it wouldn\u2019t matter. You had never met her and Cal said he didn\u2019t know her or want to go with her. What really concerns me is Cals reaction, because that is not a normal reaction unless she is mistreating him at home.

I feel for the step mom genuinely, especially if the kid is denying her authority in his life, but that is a family problem and in no way your fault.", "NTA. The fact that Cal was that upset makes me wonder about the stepmom. Not to mention her reaction.", "NTA. Perfectly appropriate response to the situation as described. TBH, if stepmom had a better relationship with Cal, this never would have been an issue. Having never even known of her existence prior to that, it would have been unthinkable to let her take the kid away after his response.", "NTA. Parental kidnapping is a real thing, although in this case it might be step-parental kidnapping. The father of Cal should be thankful you are watching out for his son's safety and welfare. It is completely reasonable you would reject a stranger's attempt to take a child. Even with Cal vetting the woman, the fact Cal did not want to go with her -- regardless of the reason -- provided ample enough reason for you to question her. Calling the boy's father, the one person you do know, was and will always be the correct course of action.

You have been around this kid three years and you have never met the wife or had anyone pick up other than the dad? How long has she even been around?

Wow, stellar parents there! You did the right thing OP, they obviously introduced stepmom and expected that Cal would just accept it all. We will all be reading Cals story here in a few years telling us the story of his awful stepmother who wants to be called mom!", "NTA and honestly their reaction is ridiculous. You did exactly the right thing and if I was Cal\u2019s dad/stepmom, I\u2019d be happy he was being minded by someone careful about his welfare. What else were you supposed to do? The child was crying and not wanting to go with a stranger! Honest to god, the gall of these people.\n\nIt sounds like Cal does not want his mother being replaced, which is obviously understandable and this adjustment to a new parent figure would be hard for him regardless. But this woman sounds awful and like she\u2019s making it even harder for the poor boy, she\u2019s not his mum and so referring to Cal as \u2018her son\u2019 is pretty heartless, no wonder he\u2019s pushing back against her. It sounds like you touched a raw nerve and it\u2019s probably a reoccurring theme in Cal\u2019s home-life, her insisting she\u2019s his \u2018parent\u2019 and him insisting that she isn\u2019t. That\u2019s on her. This little boy has lost his mommy and is dealing with trauma, the only thing she should be doing is recognising with him that she knows she\u2019s not his mother, could never replace her, and gently try to build a happy home, which will take some time and patience. No wonder he doesn\u2019t acknowledge her or the baby, it must be so tough on him having this new family and especially if she and dad are not doing anything to help him adjust. \n\nIt also sounds like she also has a lot of influence on dad, his response was rational at first but then rather than calm his wife down, became just as unhinged. So I doubt he\u2019s taking much handle on understanding his son\u2019s delicate needs and probably is more supportive of his wife\u2019s need to be instantly accepted. Awful.

HUGE RED FLAG", "I'm guessing Dad was in trouble for not mentioning that he was married and had a baby.

They can die mad about it.

You\u2019ve never even met the new wife, so there\u2019s no secret plot to undermine her authority. You also have no reason to lie about whether you knew she existed. \n\nChances are, stepmom assumed either dad or son had talked about her to the people in their lives. It would have been embarrassing to discover on someone\u2019s doorstep that they had no idea you existed, and her response was to get indignant. She may have (acting on emotion instead of logic and reason) assumed that you must be lying, because why wouldn\u2019t you know of her when she\u2019s been in Cal\u2019s life for however long. It would have been a way to protect herself from feeling hurt that he hadn\u2019t talked about her. Judging from the way Cal reacted to her, this is not a new thing in their relationship, but like lots of stepparents she thinks being authoritative and demanding his respect and obedience, she can just force him to accept her. Sadly, it doesn\u2019t work that way. The way Dad was understanding at first and then lashed out later makes me think he got an earful from her and felt backed into a corner to \u201cstand up for her.\u201d\n\nAnyway.

You acted to keep him safe, and if a similar situation arises in future with any child under your care, you should do the same thing.", "NTA they should be happy you were protecting their child from potentially being taken by a stranger", "NTA\n\nSo you were suppose to let the child go off with a complete stranger?\n\nAnd that reaction from the child that is far more disturbing, this is not so good, and one that you may want to keep an eye on.  There is far more than what is being stated there.", "NTA. You should tell his dad that Cal has *NEVER* mentioned his stepmother and you didn't even know she existed. Oh and probably a phone call next time would be nice to let you know that someone who isn't him is picking up his son. This woman is a total stranger to you. She can go fly a kite.", "Because she knows about the step mom and this is some weird maneuver in a battle between the 2 of them.", "Idk. It's pretty fucked up to use the kid as a pawn in whatever problem she has with the other mom. You should never use a kid like that.", "You told them you did not know. That should have been enough for them to know you don\u2019t know. And if they have any problems with Cal now it is not because of you not handing him out to a stranger. The problems are older than that and they need to address the real problem and not just a symptom. \n\nI would have been mad if my child was given away with a stranger. I am a bio mom and a stepmom as well and if my stepson is going to have a problem with me picking him up then they need to call his dad (or bio mom) to confirm. I rather have them be careful than them giving away my children with random strangers. You did the right thing OP", "Info: is this some weird maneuver in a personal battle you have with this other woman? Did you do this on purpose to mess with her?", "Yea, this is all the dads fault imo.", "Next time the kid is over, call the dad and tell him the step grandmother picked up the kid.", "Especially if her getting Cal is an upset to the routine of who usually gets Cal.\n\nThis is 100% on Cal's family for not texting you ahead of time of the change in plans.", "My bigger concern would be sending a child to their house.  If they think handing a child over to the first unknown person who asks for them is reasonable, would they be willing to do that to OP\u2019s child?", "I don't think she has to worry about the boy coming over anymore. If anyone refused to let me pick up my son they would never return to that house again. This story makes no sense anyways. She knows about the step mom and this was a maneuver against her for some unspoken reason.", "Right? Or call Cal's father herself, show OP she has the same number for him in her phone?", "I would say it\u2019s the op who\u2019s lucky police weren\u2019t called since she kept the kid even after learning the truth.", "What? The choice was to call the Dad or call the police. Once he was called, Dad came because the child was upset. No one held the child against the Dad's will. I don't give a crap about the strange lady at the door.", "Ooof. I have a story about a scary reaction for no reason. The Summer before my senior year in high school I was filling in for a nanny who was recovering from a surgery. The boys were 3 and 5. My first day on the job I was instructed to take the boys to the playground and to let them run in the sprinklers for a half hour before going home. It was 100+ degrees outside and there was a heat advisory. We are nearing the half hour mark and I gave the older kid a bunch of time warnings (15, 10, 5, 3, and 1 min left). The final time I asked if he wanted to come out on his own or if he wanted me to come and get him. He opted for the latter, I asked him to take my hand and he did willingly. Next thing I know he dropped down to the ground while shrieking she\u2019s kidnapping me! she\u2019s kidnapping me! all while his lil bro sat awkwardly in his stroller on the perimeter of the sprinkler area. It was horrible because all the other parents and Nannies didn\u2019t know who I was. Several of them blocked my exit and I\u2019m glad they did. I called the mom and she confirmed with several other parents that I was safe. \n\nApparently the reason he screamed that I was kidnapping him was because he thought he\u2019d be able to play longer while the police questioned me after taking me to the station. Sometimes kiddos activate chaos goblin mode and they just do things to misbehave. I don\u2019t know Cal\u2019s deal but we honestly don\u2019t know the motive behind why he behaved that way.", "Honestly my brother did something similar to my mother when he was a toddler and there was no abuse happening.  Still- something a happening with the stepmom.", "Yeah especially since she said she is his mum, which could make it worse as it takes her away from the role of step mum and into the role of mother and he is obviously going to rebel against it, and how he reacted in a fear response rather than an anger response", "While that is true, that wouldn\u2019t warrant a reaction of screaming and crying and running away, as that is more of a fear response rather than an anger response", "I worked with kids and one of the toddlers was so mad that his mom wasn\u2019t the picking him up; but grandfather, that he screamed and wailed and tried to run away. The reaction had me double check identity because it had been such extreme. But the next time; he ran to grand dad.", "NTA. Dad should have told you she was doing pick up.\nTheir relationship problems with the boy are not your issue. \nSafeguarding him is more important than her pride.", "NTA. \nIf you would\u2019ve let him go with a stranger, you would\u2019ve been in trouble. \nThe woman WAS a stranger.\nThe DAD should be thanking you. \nYou didn\u2019t know her. \nIf she had any sense, she should\u2019ve gladly encouraged you to call Dad to see.

You did the right thing.", "NTA. You did what I would want anyone to do if someone was picking up my kid.  If I had been the one pick up, I\u2019d be thankful that you\u2019d call if you felt anything was off.  \nIt sounds like Cal\u2019s dad was also okay with you verifying who the woman is.  Until he got home and got an earful from his wife.  Be understanding that he is just trying to keep peace at home.  Even if he is wrong.  \nBut, don\u2019t cut Cal out.  He may not have a great relationship with his stepmother going forward and may need a caring adult in his life.  It isn\u2019t your responsibility but is just a decent thing to do.

I would be cautious having my child go to their house unaccompanied though since they don\u2019t seem to share the same views on security.", "NTA, I would have done the same.", "NTA f that - if some stranger tried to take their son they would be singing a different tune", "Your response is 100% the perfect response.\n\nI hope the kid is okay at home.

What you did was reasonable and prudent, and what most parents would want.\n\nHer/their reaction was unreasonable given the circumstances. How would you possibly be aware of the situation if neither the child or dad ever mentioned it? You don't give an unwarranted 3rd degree to your kids playmates every time they appear unless something sets off alarm bells.  I'm sure dad was merely placating stepmom in his call.", "NTA this situation would have been completely different if he was happy to see her/ said that she was his stepmom etc but the fact that he was scared, you did the right thing!", "NTA. The parents are lashing out at you for no reason. As a responsible adult, you didn\u2019t allow some random woman take a child in your care without confirming who she was. The kid refused to go with her. I wouldn\u2019t have just handed him over either. That family needs therapy.", "NTA. I\u2019m not trusting some unmentioned stranger to pick up a crying kid who insists that\u2019s not his parent.

A kids safety comes before trusting some angry stranger.", "NTA.\n\nCal's dad completely understood while on the phone. Till he got home and his wife went off about it and \"changed\" his mind.

Not your fault this guy never went over to introduce.", "NTA. You don\u2019t know who this person is and the kid is screaming and crying. I wouldn\u2019t have her the kid either.

So, when the dad said she\u2019s the step mom and it was okay for her to take Cal\u2026 then Cal refused\u2026 what did you do as the adult who\u2019s home Cal was refusing to leave? Considering the parents who were their seem to think something happened\u2026 I tend to agree. You might be TA.", "NTA- you knew the mom had passed, the father, imho, should have introduced you to his new wife. Especially knowing that the boy spent a lot of time at your house. You were being PROTECTIVE of HIS child. Did he really expect you to hand the boy over to someone you did not know and when the boy did not want to go? Not a very good PARENT in my opinion.", "NTA. This is literally exactly how you should handle such a situation. I'm willing to guess Cal's dad probably got an earful to change his mind when he got home.", "NTA. You were protecting a child you have known for 3 years from a stranger you have never met or heard about. There are clearly serious issues going in in that home. This woman\u2019s angry phone calls and refusal to understand your perspective demonstrates that she is the problem in this situation and that Cal does not feel safe around her for a good reason.", "NTA. If you let him go with some random, then they would also blame you. Don't have their kid over again if they are being unreasonable.  What do they expect you to do about it now? They should be asking why Cal doesn't want to go with her and instead work on that.", "NTA. That dad should be listening to his son to find out why his son doesn\u2019t want to be with his wife. He is listening to and siding with her when his first priority should be his son. Your instinct was to ensure that child\u2019s safety.", "NTA. I understand why she is embarrassed but what were you supposed to do? You never saw her before and he was acting afraid!", "NTA. Parents usually say who will pick up their child and when.

Of course you didn't allow a young child to be taken from your home by a person who is claiming to be his mother when the child is denying the relationship.  The fault here is with the father failing to communicate with you in the first place. The stepmother is also way out of line.  She was a total stranger to you.  How could you possibly know whether or not she was telling the truth?  You did everything right here.", "NTA at all.\n\nYou 100% did the right thing here. \n\nVal\u2019s dad should have let you know that his wife would be picking him up and her name.

There are too many instances of nasty divorces and most child abductions are from a family member with a custody dispute. You had no idea he had a stepmother, he said he didn't want to go with her. You were erring on the side of caution and how were you supposed to know his family details if you'd never met her? She was a literal stranger to you and you took responsibility for this child. You absolutely did the right thing. If it were a school or a daycare they would have done the exact same.", "NTA. You did the absolute right thing.", "NTA I wouldn't let some strange woman take a child out of my care that the child said was not his mom. I would need some proof that this person had right to pick the child up. You were being responsible, and the father should appreciate the care you took of his child.", "NTA.

Tell both of them this is how children go missing. I feel terrible for Cal.

Did she say parent? Mom? Step-Mom?\n\nIf she said parent, kind of mixed, if she said Mom, I could see a 10 year old who lost his mom at an age where he was old enough to remember her being rebellious and saying she's not my mom but not adding she's his step-mom but if she claimed to be his step-mom, it only increases my concern in the next statement.\n\nRegardless of what she claimed to be it would seem extraordinarily concerning to me that a 10 year old has not mentioned her, would deny her claims and then refuse to go with her even AFTER it was confirmed by dad that she was in fact who she said she was and authorized to pick up Cal. The fact this women expected to bully her way through the interaction in the first place and expected you to just believe she was who she said she was just on her say-so having never met her or even heard of her speaks volumes and the fact dad was understanding at first but then took step-mom's side the following day suggests even he's cowed by her... This is a women comfortable with being a bully and using fear to get what she wants.\n\nAgain, dont know how involved you want to get in this but I'd be asking more questions (of Cal, your daughter, both parents, etc) before possibly informing whatever protective services exist in your state about your concerns. Maybe that's an overreaction and ultimately Cal might have just been being a 10-year old brat but if you're not sure what to do, I do feel like just on the observations you have made, you might consider taking a smaller step in having a chat with your daughters teachers (I'm assuming Cal and daughter go to same school and share some teachers if not classes). Not only do they know what to look for but there's a chance with behavior like this, which is probably not an anomaly, they already have a file on Cal especially since his mom passed and even if they dont have one, more eyes, particularly those better attuned to spot the signs of abuse and with even more exposure to Cal, doesn't necessarily seem like a bad thing here...", "NTA.

It\u2019s strange that he has been coming to your house for 3 years frequently and you\u2019ve never seen or heard her. It does not sound like a harmoniously blended family.", "Definitely NTA. The father should have informed you who would be picking up his son. For all you know she was a stranger or an angry ex, and Cal clearly wasn\u2019t comfortable going with her. He certainly would have been more upset had you handed his son to a kidnapper.", "Nta. It truly takes a village.
