But a couple of days ago he was at our house again and a woman came to pick him up with a baby. Cal didn't want to go with her and she was saying she was his parent, he was screaming that she wasn't, so I told her she would need to let me call Cal's dad to confirm. She told me she had the right to take her son. I told her I needed to make sure. She started getting angry, especially when Cal walked away from her and so I called his dad. He confirmed she was his wife. He told me it was okay and he understood. He ended up coming to pick him up since Cal didn't want to go with his stepmom. He seemed to understand at the door but the next day I got calls from both of them saying I should not have refused to let her take him and that I made things worse with Cal who felt he could act like she wasn't a person of authority in his life.\n\nI apologized and said that I had never known she was in his life, or that he had a sibling and I wanted to be safe. She told me I should have taken her word for it and that I knew he had a mom. I mentioned he talked about his mom dying.

How can he expect any other reaction from you than to call him to confirm?", "NTA. Being cautious with the life of a child in your care is never a mistake. All the questions you were getting were screaming \u201cstranger danger\u201d, you did the right thing in a respectful way. Obviously there are issues here that have nothing to do with you.", "NTA how would they have felt if she WASN'T his stepmum and you let him go?? \nBetter safe than sorry.", "Absolutely NTA, 10 is old enough that if they\u2019re saying someone is a stranger you should believe them. You \ud83d\udcaf did the right thing confirming with the dad.\n\nImagine if this was a stranger and you can just handed Cal over! It\u2019s always worth the extra effort to be cautious when kids are involved.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t know the woman existed how were you supposed to react? The kid didn\u2019t want to go, again how were you supposed to react? Clearly, this family has some issues & it pointing the finger at you.

You did everything right, and certainly nothing wrong. For all you know she could have been a crazy ex girlfriend or relative they\u2019re no contact with.

And the gall of Cal\u2019s parents for trying to make you take the blame for their lack of communication and blended family issues. That poor kid is in the midst of a bumpy ride and I\u2019m so sad for him. You did everything right. They are AHs.", "Wtf? NTA.\nEven if you HAD known he has a stepmom, having never met her or seen a picture of her, and with the kid screaming \"she's not my mum\", that would have been the correct response.\nI get that this might play into him not respecting her as a person of authority in his life but the circumstances are on them. How hard would it have been for his dad to text you \"listen, my wife is going to pick him up, this is what she looks like\"?", "NTA. They should have communicated that she would be picking him up. You don't know her, and you can't let some stranger take a kid. You 100% did the right thing in calling the dad and confirming.\n\nThese rules are also applied at kindergartens and daycare. I remember that my parents had to explicitly allow my grandparents and out them on a list for one specific day to pick me up.\n\nTo mey it sounds a lot like the stepmum whined about it to her partner and that's why they both called you the next day.", "I'm sure the step mother made a scene at home and the dad budged. Obviously the family doesn't blend in so well and I feel Cal is a good candidate for an AITA for not calling my step mom \"mom\" post in ten years or so.

Nobody.\n\nSecond, in wich universe Is ok give a child to some stranger when the child Is afraid and tell you it's not his mom? I mean, are they stupid or what?", "NTA I can understand the annoyance from their end. But you did the right thing. Someone you didn't know was trying to take a child from under your roof, and the kid was acting like he didn't know them. It's always better to be safe than sorry.", "Nta you were absolutely in the right. You've never met the woman. Even if you knew there was a stepmom in the picture you've no way of knowing if she was that person, especially when the kid is screaming that they're not. What's likely happened is they've gone home and she's kicked up a fuss about being \"disrespected\" etc and made dad contact you.", "NTA. Better to be safe than sorry and I applaud you not upright allowing her to take him with verifying.", "NTA. You did 1000% the right thing, like imagine what would have happened if this was a stranger, who wanted to hurt Cal and you would have allowed her to take Cal. They are the assholes for attacking you like that", "NTA \n\nIn the three years of you knowing this little boy, his father never mentioned there was a stepmother in the picture? You were absolutely right to not let Cal go off with a stranger who turned up on your doorstep.\n\nCal's father is the AH here for not mentioning he had a new wife. And judging by Cal's reaction to her, there's obviously tension between them, especially if she's calling herself his parent and calling him her son when he's not. It's up to Cal's dad and stepmum to sort that situation out, not blame their family dysfunction on you. \n\nNo way would I have let some strange woman, whose mere presence was enough to provoke this kind of reaction from a 10 year old, take that child from my house. Your job while Cal is in your care is to make sure he's safe. Cal's parents are wrong to try and fault you for doing what you  were supposed to.", "NTA you did the right thing", "NTA. Cal\u2019s parents have a problem with Cal not you. You were acting responsibly by calling his father. I\u2019m not sure why his father came to get him instead of telling him he had to go with his stepmother. And, I don\u2019t know why both felt a need to place blame on you afterwards. Most likely the stepmother was angry about Cal and her husband undermining her authority, and it was easier to place blame on you rather than where it really belongs. This is a family problem they need to work out.\n\nPS Years ago, a worker at a local school allowed a woman who wasn\u2019t authorized to pick up the child to take them (pick up was in the cafeteria, away from the computers and list of people authorized to pick up kids). She said she was their mother, and the child seemed to know her and went with her willingly. It turned out she was the mother, but there had been problems with her taking the child so the father couldn\u2019t have access to them, thus kidnapping them. She did take the child home that evening and a nightmare was avoided, but the school cracked down on their pickup procedures. You can\u2019t be too careful. You did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nIf the father had told you his wife would be picking Cal up none of this would have happened so it's on them.\n\nDon't schools need to know who's likely to be picking a child up?  Why should it be any different outside of schools?", "NTA. My favorite saying for this kind of situation is, \u201c How was I supposed to know that? Osmosis?\u201d.", "NTA.  There are obviously underlying issues at home here that they both feel you\u2019ve exposed and they\u2019re taking it out on you.  She\u2019s upset at him for never mentioning her existence, and they\u2019re both upset that the son refused to go with her and basically denied her place in his life.", "NTA. You didn't know she existed. There's no way they know what you do or don't know..they aren't you. They should be happy that you refused to let him go with someone he said he didn't know. Dad only changed his mind after stepmother went off on him or whatever lol", "NTA you acted the way any responsible adult would. This is all on _them_ for 1 for not keeping you in the loop, for 2 for sending the step-\"mom\" to pick up a kid, who is clearly not comfortable with her.", "Definitely NTA for calling dad,  but in my opinion,  once Cal's dad confirmed on the phone, you should have told cal to go with the stepmom.  She is a valid authority figure in his life, whether he likes it or not.", "An stranger shows up at your house wanting to take the kid, the kid screams and refuses to go and they were expecting for you to trust in the stranger and force the kid to go with her? God this people on top on being AH are stupid, poor kid. \nThe kid has been coming to your house for three year, the father should have introduce his partner to you and let you know she'll be picking the kid up too, what he did was unbelievably irresponsible and careless so now he rather blame you than acknowledge he messed up.\nNTA (forgot to put the judgment)", "NTA. Seriously, NTA. You did exactly the right thing not sending a child with a stranger. Look at this from the other side. If she hadn\u2019t been his stepmom but you let him go anyway? Always err on the side of caution.", "NTA. You 100% did the right thing.", "NTA.\n\nAlthough it was pretty obvious what was going on, it was the responsible thing to do just in case this woman was trying to kidnap the kid.", "NTA and sounds like probably abusive home life there", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Granted normally a woman wouldn't have just shown up at your door asking for your daughters friend with out cause, but given his reaction, and the fact that you had no knowledge of her previously, you made the right call.

Especially when he became so defensive toward her. He's such a sweet kid and behaves really well so it was such a stark difference in behavior for him.", "I get where you're coming from but forcing a reluctant child to go with an angry adult  would have raised alarm bells with me. This was probably not the first time Cals refused to go with his father's wife so that's why his dad came to get him. \n\nCal is not the problem, Cal's father has been avoiding a few big problems for way too long. Cal needs professional help to understand that his place at home is secure and that his fathers wife means him no harm. It is a concern that Cal hasn't mentioned this woman or the birth of his half sibling in the 3 years he's been coming on playdates, yet his dad probably started dating her around that time.", "The fact that this was 100% what you should have done in the situation, and they\u2019re this upset about it, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d let the boy come over to your house again for at least a while. This is really bizarre they wanted you to be okay sending him off with someone who he was actively running away from and crying and yelled when all you wanted to do was confirm. You are so NTA and yeah I\u2019d be worried going forward how they\u2019ll act and what else they\u2019ll be unreasonable and unhinged about eta: and how are they treating your daughter when she\u2019s at *their* house? What other safety do they not take seriously?", "So weird... and then for them to call you & bitch. Mom got embarrassed cause Cal wasn\u2019t enthusiastically cheering her existence.

Also, I bet the dad is in trouble because wife realized he never talks about her.", "Or given you a call that his wife was picking  cal up.nta you acted correctly", "Dad is probably embarrassed and covering himself because stepmom is like wtf do people not know I exist? OP absolutely did the right thing and this is 100% on the dad.", "I do get that feeling.

You absolutely did the right thing", "NTA\n\nAnd, if I could, I would just keep right on saying it. \n\nYou had no idea who this lady was, who suddenly showed up on your porch. Every single instinct in your head was spot on. Not only that, you listened to this child, who obviously didn't want to go with this woman. \n\nYou did the best you could have done, with the information you had: Verified the identity of this woman with the child's father. You had never met her before; the child was clearly upset at the thought of going with her.

They were aware of the situation and luckily the kids didn't even see him but cops were called. \n\nAll this to say, it happens more often than you think that a parent or ex step parent or aunt or whoever it is, who does not have custody and is not supposed to be in contact, tries to pick up kids. \n\nI would never hand over a child to someone I've never seen or heard about especially if the child was screaming that that isn't his mum. \n\nI bet stepmum and dad were frustrated and embarrassed but your responsibility was the safety of this child and not their comfort, and you did everything right. It could have been someone who isn't a safe person for this child to be around.", "NTA. They can both F all the way off.

How were you to know?  They should be grateful that you were so diligent.  Especially since the boy didn't help by saying she isn't his Mom, which is true but he knew very well what he was implying.\n\nThat's a discussion between the three of them.  You were right not to take her at her word.  If I were the parent, I would be thinking that you were a real keeper as far as someone I trusted my child with.", "NTA you did the right thing!!!! What if she wasn't who she said, and kidnapped him?", "NTA. \n\nWhat if she hadn't been Cal's stepmother & you let him go with her? You did exactly the right thing to protect a distressed child in your care. Cal's parents acted irresponsibly by not informing you of who was to collect him in the first place. A stranger to you (who you didn't even know existed) came to your house to collect a child & the child denied she was his stepmom, you listen to the child. They're obviously having difficulties as a family, but they didn't tell you that. How would you know?\n\nHonestly, you made best decision.", "NTA.\n\nThe dad is just embarrassed because he never mentioned her and is trying to cover his ass. Otherwise he'd have had an issue with it at the time.", "NTA you didthe right thing, you had never met this person the child didn't want to go with them and that didn't want you to contact the known parent.  I would speak to the dad again, re explain the situation but add you had never heard of stepmother let alone met her yet they are saying you should have potentially let a kidnapper, abuser or ex girlfriend take a child from your home.  Stepmother was a complete stranger yo you and in a situation like this it would have been appropriate to send you a text letting you know someone new was picking him up preferably with a photo rather than expecting you to take the word of a stranger and potentially put his child at risk.  Honestly what would he done if you had actually let him go and the adult was not meant to be picking the child up?  What they are asking (thats likely driven by stepmother). Goes against every child safty rule out there", "NTA. This really weird they didn't say anything to you about a new wife and baby, and just assumed you'd know.  Even a quick text \"hey,  my wife will be picking him up today\" would have made things 100% easier.", "NTA - you absolutely did everything correctly! This is the procedure when it comes unknown to you people picking up children. It seems that the husband got an earful when he got home from his wife and decided to change his tune. \n\nThank you for being a sensible adult in this situation. Keep being that way.", "The only reason he called the next day and was angry is because he got in trouble with his wife for not continuing to force Cal to accept her in front of other people and \"humiliating\" her", "In 3 years, you've never met this woman or heard about her from either the kid or his dad.  Of course you were concerned! And who doesn't send a message saying \"his stepmother, x, is picking him up.\" I do this when MY PARENTS have my kid and they know my husband", "Honestly, OP, regardless of how they feel you did the right thing. 100%, without question. I genuinely hope that knowing that bring you some peace in this situation.", "Tell her she's lucky you didn't call the police for attempted kidnapping, which was your other option. That should shut her up.", "The dad has screwed up and is covering his ass because his wife is making him miserable. \n\nYou did the right thing.", "Agree with this. \u261d\ufe0f", "OPs house is safe familiar territory for this boy, so I would be advocating for him to come over more often rather than cutting him off from close friends in his time of crisis. \n\nMaybe both families could get together for dinner one night? As a concerned mum I'd be wanting to check out the family dynamic, especially before.accepting any invitation for OPs daughter to come over.", "Especially since there might be a reason for his reaction and him never mentioning that he has a step mom or new sibling.", "Honestly that reaction is scary.  Kids don't usually react like that for no reason.  I know some can be shit stirring brats but honestly it sets my teeth on edge.", "Yes, I agree. Very unsettling"]}
