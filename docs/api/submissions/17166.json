The thing is that they were like \"we want to throw a big party but we have big families and we cant invite you all (friends)\". They all did it that way because soon after the wedding, all the couples moved abroad, so was like \"we really wish we had more money invested on this and celebrate with you all, but we also are on a budget\". I felt it fair, back then, because it was also their goodbye party.\n\nIn all the cases, there was enough space for more guests so the money was for the dinner and drinks mostly (the officer, decorations, dj, etc were more or less the same with or without us). \n\nIn all those cases, the couples were frank and direct from the beggining, and overall it was not as much money you are writting. And also, it happened like thrice in 6 years, so it was affordable for us.\n\nAll that being said, I also dont understand the need to charge to ALL the guests nor to expect than the people you are inviting pay the whole thing. If I remember correctly, the most I paid was like 60 dollars and 20 more for transport that we had to arrange.", "NTA I hate weddings, and even if I liked them they came be quite expensive to attend with outfits, hotel rooms, gift etc. there\u2019s no way I\u2019m also stumping up cash to go, they can do one", "Is D for covering the cost of guests in attendance? Like room and board for a shared bungalow? Or is that to pay for the honeymoon suite? If it's for the guests, that's perfectly fine. Maybe even nice since hotels can cost more than that per night. It's basically just a group rate for the hotel stay, which is fine. If it's the honeymoon suite, that's a major asshole move.", "Lol NO. NTA, couples A-C are gross. Couple D seems cool, I bet their wedding will be the most enjoyable.\n\nI\u2019m having a destination wedding next month, shits expensive right now!

Las Vegas!! There\u2019s something for everyone!!!", "NTA. This is so tacky and ridiculous. In my culture, it\u2019s customary to give cash to the couple at the wedding.

I've never heard of this trend until now. Super tacky. Have a smaller wedding if you need to charge your INVITED GUESTS, holy cow.

An explanation could be provided with the invitation.", "NTA. But in my culture it is common for people to bring an envelope of money to contribute to the event (we call it chinchule). No amount is required, its whatever you want to give. This is seen as the tribe supporting its members and very normalized for birthdays, weddings, christenings, etc. The AH move is requiring something from someone for attendance.", "NTA\nWow\u2026just wow", "NTA.

We are in the US. We arrived in Paris and the wedding itself was two hours into the countryside. \n\nI think it just caught me off guard because nothing was relayed about it when we inquired accommodation information and not much info was given about what we ended up contributing for. Either way, that clears up alot!\n\nAs for my aunt it was a couple years ago and we were all shocked. She never got her money back. It was a very awkward situation. I think the parents were supportive of the couple.", "I agree with your assessment. Couple D seems extremely reasonable", "Yep. D I\u2019m on the fence about. I would, just as a matter of course, spend probably over $150 going to a wedding between food, travel, and accommodations. So, in theory, why do I care who I\u2019m paying?  My only loss is the the value of the points on my credit card. \n\nAnd that\u2019s not even including the gift, which they haven\u2019t asked for. I\u2019d probably throw some extra cash in as a gift because they are probably HEAVILY subsidizing my costs in room and board and Ubers. \n\nPlus it\u2019s 50/50 whether they\u2019ll invest it back into the party I am benefitting from. I remember my coworker getting an unexpected bonus at work after 99% of the wedding was paid for and almost crying when she said \u201cnow I can afford appetizers.\u201d  So 100% if that cash gift comes in before the wedding, it\u2019s going to booze and food , which, again, only helps you. And it\u2019s cheaper in the long run. \n\nBut my answer is also TOTALLY dependent on a) how upfront they were, b) how much I like them, c) how much I think of enjoy it, and d) if they were generally not tacky people (such that this must be their only option).", "Yeah that's what I was thinking for D, thets pretty cheap for accommodation, it's likely they got some kind of block booking that was cheaper or just thought it would be easier/nicer for people to be staying in the same hotel and not have to worry everyone by making them book a hotel in a foreign country in foreign currency, could definitely be difficult for the less tech savvy relatives", "I feel like it\u2019s snowballed from bridesmaid/grooms-night-out to weekend wedding party festivities to \u201cyou need to pay for the party\u201d to international party trips to destination weddings (those have been around I know) to demanding gifts to straight out sending an invoice. \n\nThese people are fucking insane.

I am surprised that people are willing to pay!", "Miss Manners (and any other etiquette expert) would be side-eyeing you for your first sentence.

Pretty sure they/their parents supplied the main dish, and cake, and the rest of the people brought sides and drinks. Holding potluck parties where the hosts supply the cake and main dish is fairly common for events of any type on that side of my family. They were young and didn\u2019t have money to have a big thing. They got to have everyone there without breaking the bank, and more people should be thinking this way.
