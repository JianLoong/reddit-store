However, anything smaller than that and my wife and I are miserable and do not sleep at all because of his tossing and turning.\n\nGiven the above, I asked my parents if they would be okay swapping rooms with us just for this trip... a message that they ignored for 5 days until this morning where my dad said he would try to see if he could somehow get a bigger bed in the smaller room but that, no, he needed to stay in the big room and he hoped I understood.

I've slept in a queen sized bed with my husband and two toddlers on vacations many times, it's absolutely doable.  It would be one thing if it was an impossible situation, like having to fit two two of you and the baby in a twin, but it's not.  It's slightly less comfortable than if you had the king sized bed, and it's unreasonable for you to expect your parents to give up the nice room - that again, THEY paid for - in order to take the smaller room (that they also paid for, and you should be grateful to have).", "YTA.

I say this as a first-time parent who stayed at my SIL\u2019s house with my husband and 2 yr old. When she vomited all over the pack and play (stomach bug), we fit her in the queen bed between us rather than expected my SIL and her husband to give us their bed. And when I traveled alone with her when she was 3, I made a solid pillow wall on the other side of the queen bed.

An 18 month old isn't rational; you can't reason with them. Everyone saying you're being too soft with a toddler clearly has no understanding that there is no other option at that age. Toddlers at this age go through phases for a few weeks or months sometimes that you can't do anything about except get through them. Phases about sleep, especially when its a temporary sleep measure, are common and the advice is to roll with them. And getting through them with no sleep is NOT recommended. That doesn't automatically mean that you're refusing to ever discipline your child or insisting that everyone's life revolves around the child.\n\nYou made a reasonable request, your dad said no, and instead of forcing the issue, you simply said that doesn't work for us, we're unable to come. That is literally the Reddit advice: asking for an accommodation is reasonable, not forcing the issue and deciding not to go is the only reasonable response when the accommodation can't be provided. Your parents can still go on the trip alone. And you and your wife can get some decent rest over the long weekend. That doesn't mean you're entitled or spoiling your child.
