{"id": 28278, "submission_id": "170lc06", "title": "AITA for giving my graduation ticket to my \"stepmom\" and introducing her as my parent?", "selftext": "My (18M) dad (36M) high school GF, Melanie (36F) had me when they were 18. My dad asked if they could get a termination as he had dreams of going to college. Melanie was Baptist so she said no, dad said OK as it was her decision, decided to drop college and start a family. When I was 6 months old, Melanie said this wasn't the life she wanted, had a breakdown, dumped me on dad and moved.\n\nMy dads parents and my dad looked after me, while my dad attended a smaller college in-state. Soon, he met Anita, an Indian exchange student, and by the time I was 2, they were married. Btw, Dad is white and so is Melanie, so obviously I am too. When they graduated, we moved to our current state, and dad and Anita did PhDs. They're both Profs in my state's Ivy college, and I have a brother Peter aged 8. \n\nI put \"stepmom\" in quotes because ever since I could talk I called Anita mom, and she was always my mom. She loves me, never showed any difference in affection towards me and Peter, and is my best friend.\n\nLast year Melanie got in touch as she moved to my state. She had a husband and 2 kids (Peter's age). She kept inviting me around, asking me to do stuff with her and \"my siblings\", and sometimes I'd say yes but I didn't care about her as she never cared till I was 17, sorry if that sounds rude. She asked if I could call her Mom also, I declined, she seemed OK if a little pissed. \n\nI did well in school, and got a state award and a full college ride for next year. The ceremony was last week. I got 3 \"free\" tickets - anyone else who wanted to come had to pay $25 each. I gave the tickets to Dad, Anita, and Peter. Melanie was offended, and asked why I couldn't give her one and my parents pay for Peter, I said no. So she paid for her, her kids, and husband to come.\n\nIn my speech I thanked my parents for helping me with schoolwork, and joked that I picked a college far away as they taught in ours. Afterwards, an official asked which were my parents to congratulate them, assuming it was Dad and Melanie (fair, since I am white). I said no, that Dad and Anita were my parents, so he congratulated them. \n\nMelanie started crying after the event, telling me how \"insulting\" it was for me to say Anita was my parent, and how it looks awful for me to keep saying that \"an Indian lady was my mom, even though everyone knows thats not true\". Dad\u00a0 whisked us off, but Melanie has been posting on FB about \"brainwashed\" children of divorce and \"elitists\" looking down on people who didn't go to college. \n\nReddit, was I horrible? I know it seems rude to say Anita is my parent and ignore Melanie but in that context (and all contexts) I wanted Anita to get the credit because SHE was the college prof and SHE helped me with school, even more than dad as she did the humanities (where I struggled). Also, Melanie and my dad were never married. \n\nIs this normal? Must I call her mom too just because we are the same race, so people don't look at us weird? Have I embarassed her in public? Please help.\n\nEdit: nobody has ever \"looked at us weird\" btw, and nothing has made me feel insecure about not being Anita's race. I see her as my mom and always have, and while people sometimes get confused, they catch on quite fast as my state is quite diverse so multiracial families are common.\n\nEdit 2: for those saying me thanking my parents for having professorships at an Ivy could be seen as classist/elitist, but I disagree. I was not punching down. What I wanted to do with that comment (in addition to thanking my parents themselves) was acknowledge and account for my privilege. Having parents who are Ivy professors is an *enormous* privilege: not just in terms of money, but because they would be very well placed to help me get into an Ivy, which is a privilege most others don't have. There is a reason why many universities offer scholarships to students who are the first in their family to go to university, because they are less likely to know how to navigate the academic system. Forget college graduate, my parents are professors - so dial the privilege up to a ten. That's what I was trying to do, NOT punch down!", "created_utc": 1696520824, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/170lc06/aita_for_giving_my_graduation_ticket_to_my/", "score": 3720, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I also was very blunt in saying she was stupid for thinking I'd stop calling Anita mom because she was a different race, and because I was so angry, I told her that we don't share a single thing except our race and that is not important to me at all.

You won a prestigious academic award (I presume), and thanked your parents who instilled a good work ethic in you, and helped you with your schoolwork. That is not elitist, or \"looking down on people who didn't go to college.\" That is you acknowledging your university lecturer parents as *the reason* you have done so well academically, which is very normal. Especially considering the circumstances - your dad, and later Anita, did the full graduate student gauntlet while caring for a young child. Of course you thanked them: that's an immense achievement on their part, and they fully deserve all the congratulations and pride you bring them. \n\nMelanie is trying to victimise herself as being discriminated against because she \"didn't go to college\". Her not going to college is a her problem, not a you problem: she ran off on her kid at 19, she could have done a college degree much more easily than your dad could have - yet he persevered. \n\nGood on you for having Anita's back on this, you sound like a fantastic son. Melanie simply wants to show off \"her son\", who she had ignored all his life, now that he's getting all the gold medals - because why on *earth* else would she have brought her entire family to your award ceremony, even though you've only met them a year ago?

Melanie is not any of them just because she gave birth to you. She didn't help you navigate childhood, help with your homework, bathe you, feed you, care for you, had \"the talk\" with you, or anything that a caring parent does to earn their title. She is your birthgiver and a person you know and nothing else. You are under no obligation to give her anything she hasn't earned in your life, including a presence. She is not entitled to any of this, especially considering her history. \n\nShe feels guilty for not being in your life and is deflecting this guilt and blaming \"elitism\" to make herself feel better. \"It's not *MY* fault my son doesn't see me as a parent, it's those pesky college degrees!\" She doesn't deserve your guilt or anyone's sympathy for that. Don't enable her selfish nature. You are at zero fault here.\n\nPart of being a good parent is being a good influence. And right now all she is teaching you is how to buck blame, become a doormat to manipulative behavior, and that actions have no consequences. But they DO, and becoming firm in your initial resolve will make YOU a better influence than she has ever been.\n\nAnita sounds like a good mom who has earned the title. I'm happy she was able to fill that role for you.", "NTA. You might want to correct the Facebook account. You don't look down on her because she didn't go to college.

She's practically a stranger to you and that's her own fault. She abandoned you and you should take every opportunity to remind her of that. Your bio mom is also spouting off some ridiculous talking points to rally like-minded (aka racist) people to her corner who will agree that she is the victim and feel sorry for her.

By rightly acknowledging Anita as your parent you only showed bare to the world her insecurity shame about abandoning you for all those years, but that's hers to bear and not your fault.", "NTA. Melanie made her bed by abandoning you, and is now trying to make you responsible for her feelings of embarrassment and guilt. She's feeling the weight of her own actions, and obviously never grew up, because she's trying to project those feelings onto others (you and Anita). \n\nAnita is your mom, she's your parent, in every sense of the word. Biology can help people become parents, but it's only one way. The way Melanie is treating your mom is also abhorrent, as she's demonstrating racism by believing she should be the 'preferred' mother because she's white. \n\nI'm glad you had such wonderful parents who took excellent care of you and gave you the love you needed to thrive. Melanie wasn't a part of that, and she doesn't deserve any credit.", "Anita did a great job raising you. She's your mom, and no one gets to say otherwise.

I want you to understand that my decision to distance myself from you, and my reluctance to invest heavily in a relationship with you and your children, has nothing to do with them. It is entirely based on the choices you've made since we met again, and the actions you've taken. You can complain about this all you want: but if you want to continue having contact with me, these issues are going to have to be addressed by you, or my current feelings on the subject won't change. If and when your children and Peter see each other again, I expect a sincere apology from them and an acknowledgement from you that their comments were not 'teasing' but racialized bullying, and that that behavior is absolutely unacceptable under any circumstances. Additionally, if I see any other comments or posts on social media that allude, even vaguely, to my parents being at fault for conflicts between us, I'll have no choice but to distance myself further. I'm simply not comfortable with our private differences of opinion on family matters ending up smeared across your timeline.\" And emphasize that moving forward, the ball is in her court.

She wants the fact you don't see her as \"mom\" to be everyone else's fault. In her eyes, you're in the wrong for not instantly affording her the position in your life she thinks she's entitled to: your dad is wrong for not pining endlessly for her return and saving the sacred position of mother for her reclaim whenever it finally suited her: Anita is wrong for \"stealing\" what should be Melanie's exclusive place in your life. This is where her baffling behavior is coming from, most likely. She feels horribly guilty for abandoning you and can't forgive herself. So she's projecting that guilt on anyone she can. I'll be honest, you'll likely struggle to have a healthy relationship as long as this is the case. She can't have a relationship with you, the adult in front of her, because on some level she's trapped as a scared teen still feeling ashamed of the tiny baby she left behind.

Melanie was just mad because she wanted the social credit for being your mother, **AFTER SHE DID NOTHING TO EARN IT**.

This woman, who spent half her life raising you, would (due to her race) have had *so* many people would not realise that she is responsible for your achievements, because she would never immediately be \"recognised\" as your parent. That'll be something she has always faced, when, say, taking you out by herself, or at PTA meetings, nobody could intrinsically tell that Anita was your mom - and that must have been hard for her. Melanie jumped on that fact, and tried to cruelly use it for her own gain. And you, being an amazing son, made sure she didn't face that dismissal today, and explicitly said that Anita deserved the credit she was due. White or not, that's outstanding empathy.\n\nNot to mention, from your other comment, you saw Melanie's kids be racist to your brother and you immediately put a stop to it and ensured your parents remove him from their presence, regardless of Melanie's relation to you. *How* could this woman expect a boy who did something as mature as that, to turn his back on his mother due to her race?\n\nAnyway, enormous congratulations to you, and best of luck at university.
