My dad asked if they could get a termination as he had dreams of going to college. Melanie was Baptist so she said no, dad said OK as it was her decision, decided to drop college and start a family. When I was 6 months old, Melanie said this wasn't the life she wanted, had a breakdown, dumped me on dad and moved.\n\nMy dads parents and my dad looked after me, while my dad attended a smaller college in-state. Soon, he met Anita, an Indian exchange student, and by the time I was 2, they were married. Btw, Dad is white and so is Melanie, so obviously I am too. When they graduated, we moved to our current state, and dad and Anita did PhDs. They're both Profs in my state's Ivy college, and I have a brother Peter aged 8. \n\nI put \"stepmom\" in quotes because ever since I could talk I called Anita mom, and she was always my mom. She loves me, never showed any difference in affection towards me and Peter, and is my best friend.\n\nLast year Melanie got in touch as she moved to my state. She had a husband and 2 kids (Peter's age). She kept inviting me around, asking me to do stuff with her and \"my siblings\", and sometimes I'd say yes but I didn't care about her as she never cared till I was 17, sorry if that sounds rude. She asked if I could call her Mom also, I declined, she seemed OK if a little pissed. \n\nI did well in school, and got a state award and a full college ride for next year. The ceremony was last week. I got 3 \"free\" tickets - anyone else who wanted to come had to pay $25 each. I gave the tickets to Dad, Anita, and Peter. Melanie was offended, and asked why I couldn't give her one and my parents pay for Peter, I said no. So she paid for her, her kids, and husband to come.\n\nIn my speech I thanked my parents for helping me with schoolwork, and joked that I picked a college far away as they taught in ours. Afterwards, an official asked which were my parents to congratulate them, assuming it was Dad and Melanie (fair, since I am white). I said no, that Dad and Anita were my parents, so he congratulated them. \n\nMelanie started crying after the event, telling me how \"insulting\" it was for me to say Anita was my parent, and how it looks awful for me to keep saying that \"an Indian lady was my mom, even though everyone knows thats not true\". Dad\u00a0 whisked us off, but Melanie has been posting on FB about \"brainwashed\" children of divorce and \"elitists\" looking down on people who didn't go to college. \n\nReddit, was I horrible? I know it seems rude to say Anita is my parent and ignore Melanie but in that context (and all contexts) I wanted Anita to get the credit because SHE was the college prof and SHE helped me with school, even more than dad as she did the humanities (where I struggled). Also, Melanie and my dad were never married. \n\nIs this normal? Must I call her mom too just because we are the same race, so people don't look at us weird? Have I embarassed her in public? Please help.\n\nEdit: nobody has ever \"looked at us weird\" btw, and nothing has made me feel insecure about not being Anita's race. I see her as my mom and always have, and while people sometimes get confused, they catch on quite fast as my state is quite diverse so multiracial families are common.", "created_utc": 1696520824, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/170lc06/aita_for_giving_my_graduation_ticket_to_my/", "score": 434, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm not sure how a woman you did not know until you were 17 could ever demand you call her mum, instead of the woman who changed your diapers and bandaged your knees through your childhood. \n\nYou would be NTA in any situation, but especially this. You won a prestigious academic award (I presume), and thanked your parents who instilled a good work ethic in you, and helped you with your schoolwork. That is not elitist, or \"looking down on people who didn't go to college.\" That is you acknowledging your university lecturer parents as *the reason* you have done so well academically, which is very normal. Especially considering the circumstances - your dad, and later Anita, did the full graduate student gauntlet while caring for a young child. Of course you thanked them: that's an immense achievement on their part, and they fully deserve all the congratulations and pride you bring them. \n\nMelanie is trying to victimise herself as being discriminated against because she \"didn't go to college\". Her not going to college is a her problem, not a you problem: she ran off on her kid at 19, she could have done a college degree much more easily than your dad could have - yet he persevered. \n\nGood on you for having Anita's back on this, you sound like a fantastic son. Melanie simply wants to show off \"her son\", who she had ignored all his life, now that he's getting all the gold medals - because why on *earth* else would she have brought her entire family to your award ceremony, even though you've only met them a year ago?

Melanie is not any of them just because she gave birth to you. She didn't help you navigate childhood, help with your homework, bathe you, feed you, care for you, had \"the talk\" with you, or anything that a caring parent does to earn their title. She is your birthgiver and a person you know and nothing else. You are under no obligation to give her anything she hasn't earned in your life, including a presence. She is not entitled to any of this, especially considering her history. \n\nShe feels guilty for not being in your life and is deflecting this guilt and blaming \"elitism\" to make herself feel better. \"It's not *MY* fault my son doesn't see me as a parent, it's those pesky college degrees!\" She doesn't deserve your guilt or anyone's sympathy for that. Don't enable her selfish nature. You are at zero fault here.\n\nPart of being a good parent is being a good influence. And right now all she is teaching you is how to buck blame, become a doormat to manipulative behavior, and that actions have no consequences. But they DO, and becoming firm in your initial resolve will make YOU a better influence than she has ever been.\n\nAnita sounds like a good mom who has earned the title. I'm happy she was able to fill that role for you.", "NTA. You might want to correct the Facebook account. You don't look down on her because she didn't go to college. You look down on her because she completely abandoned you at the age of 6 months and was completely out of your life for the next 16 years.", "NTA. Your bio mother embarrassed herself. She's practically a stranger to you and that's her own fault. She abandoned you and you should take every opportunity to remind her of that. Your bio mom is also spouting off some ridiculous talking points to rally like-minded (aka racist) people to her corner who will agree that she is the victim and feel sorry for her. Race and ethnicity have no place in this conversation. A woman stepped up for a child in need when her so-called mother walked away.

Melanie doesn't get to take the title just because she donated an egg and 9 months of incubation. By rightly acknowledging Anita as your parent you only showed bare to the world her insecurity shame about abandoning you for all those years, but that's hers to bear and not your fault.", "NTA. Melanie made her bed by abandoning you, and is now trying to make you responsible for her feelings of embarrassment and guilt. She's feeling the weight of her own actions, and obviously never grew up, because she's trying to project those feelings onto others (you and Anita). \n\nAnita is your mom, she's your parent, in every sense of the word. Biology can help people become parents, but it's only one way. The way Melanie is treating your mom is also abhorrent, as she's demonstrating racism by believing she should be the 'preferred' mother because she's white. \n\nI'm glad you had such wonderful parents who took excellent care of you and gave you the love you needed to thrive. Melanie wasn't a part of that, and she doesn't deserve any credit.", "Anita did a great job raising you. She's your mom, and no one gets to say otherwise.

More importantly tell her what is not acceptable. Like constantly trying to guilt you for living through the consequences of her actions.  Trying to make you feel bad or publicly trying to shame you for living your best life is also unacceptable. No more posts on social media about you period. \n\nI know this sounds harsh but honestly maybe remind Her decision was to walk away.

Parents don't get to nope out of your life and be honored simply for providing half of your DNA for existence!

Spoiler alert! That\u2019s exactly what he did. When I was 7, my mom met my now stepdad and he became my male role model (along with my uncle (Mom\u2019s brother).

Anita did not give birth to you, but she is your Mom in every way that matters. No one gets to take that from her. Especially not the woman who abandoned you. If she's upset by not being recognized as your mother, she has no one but herself to blame. SHE created this entire situation. So if she doesn't like it, tough toenails.

You did not embarrass her, she did that all on her own.  Frankly strangers are more likely to look kindly on the two-mom issue when they both get along and don\u2019t make a scene.   You don\u2019t have to call Melanie mom or mother or anything you don\u2019t want to call her.  In fact, you don\u2019t have to see her if you do not want to, there is no rule about it.   You can rightly flip things on her and point out that she abandoned you when you were a baby and didn\u2019t bother to get back in touch with you until you were ready to graduate high school.   She did not earn the right to be called mom.   When she claims you are \u201cpunishing her\u201d your response can/should be, frankly I don\u2019t give you that much thought.  \n\nYou are also correct to feel like Melanie didn\u2019t give two s**ts abut you until you were close to adulthood - and I wonder is she was looking to use you as a free babysitter.", "NTA\n\nNext time Melanie posts about you online, be sure to respond with the full story, including the racism directed at your 8 year old brother.\n\nAll of it. As you wrote it here.\n\nIt sounds to me like you had great parents in Anita and your dad. Anita is your mum. \n\nYou may want to go no contact with Melanie if she keeps being a cow.", "NTA... she needs to do some work and actually make a positive contribution to your life before you can actually consider calling her \"mom\".

Not for leaving you with your dad though, it's for the way she's acting now. Anita is your mom, blood relation or not, not Melanie", "Yeah, NTA. Anita was the one who came in and said \"yeah let's do this mom s**t.\" Melanie made her choice to abandon you. She doesn't get to come in 17 years later and demand the mom award.

She started to embarrass herself in the second she left and should be grateful for Anita, that she was and is the mom you needed.\nAnd frankly, I think Anita and your dad did a good job and I am sure, that most people who know you and your parents will see that too.\n\nFeel free to ignore this stranger called Melanie.", "Melanie walked out of your life at 6 months after forcing your father to put his dreams on hold for her. Your father clearly bounced back and did his best to raise you while studying, found a lovely partner who was a great mother to you. You have no reason to be ashamed of your choices at all. \n\nAnita was in your life for 15 years. Melanie was in it for 6 months. The child decides who their parents are, not the blood. You don't have to call Melanie anything you don't want to. All Melanie is doing is burning bridges instead of being understanding. If she really wanted to make amends, she would be patient with your decision. You don't owe her anything.", ">ever since I could talk I called Anita mom, and she was always my mom. She loves me, never showed any difference in affection towards me and Peter, and is my best friend.\n\n> I wanted Anita to get the credit because SHE was the college prof and SHE helped me with school, even more than dad as she did the humanities (where I struggled). Also, Melanie and my dad were never married.\n\nTell your racist egg donor this. Communicate to Melanie what you feel and why she is not your mom. If you are open to having a relationship with Melanie, tell her you will do so at your pace and not hers. If not, you can convey that too.\n\nNTA.", "Maybe it's because Melanie didn't go to college, but please inform her the next time you see her that it takes more than being an egg donor and caring for a newborn for 6 months to be called a mother. Mothers are usually there for their child growing up. They love and care for their child and do more than the bare minimum of providing food, clothes, and shelter. Anita is clearly your mom. Melanie is the woman who gave birth to you, but gave up being a mom when she abandoned you at 6 months old.\n\nThen again, you don't have to college to know that, since I know that and I dropped out after 1 semester.", "Melanie made her decision to not be mom, when she walked away and left you and dad .", "Your parents have raised a great son and big brother, I think you should go NC with Melanie.

Melanie left you at 6 months then showed back up when you were 17. She didn't raise you, your dad and Anita did. Melanie wants the credit, when all she did was take off and reappear years later.", "Nta. Melanie is your biological mother. I think you should give her respect as much as any other adult maybe a little more because she is your parent.

The result was not good for her at all, and it broke my heart.)", "Oh no no no no, NTA, not by a long shot. Melanie is crazy, my word, she's delusional and (maybe) racist. Who cares what your mother looks like, she didn't care what you looked like, she loved you and raised you. You're so kind to even feel bad, but you really don't need to, you did the right thing and thanked the right people.

Melanie is your egg donor. Tell her you respect her but if she\u2019s going to freak out all the time you want distance from her. You\u2019re NTA", "Yeah thanks I mean the main reason I don't like Melanie is because the first few times we agreed to do stuff with her, she let her kids call Peter Apu (from the Simpsons), and did not scold them for it, which I noticed cos I waa the one watching the kids. She called it childhood teasing and that they learned it from school. So I stopped saying yes to things and told my parents the reason, so they obviously don't let Peter go out with Melanie and the kids anymore, which means I also don't want to go because Peter gets sad if I go \"play with other kids\" without him (which is fair imo since he's only 8 years old).", "More than just a whiff", "Yeah thats actually the exact reason why I wanted to give them a shoutout. I still remember when they were doing their PhDs and starting their lectureships because I spent many hours until I was 8 or 9 playing in their offices or sitting in lectures with colouring books.
