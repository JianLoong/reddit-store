My 25F sister lives with me and has been paying $425 in rent since March of 2021. She moved in with us when I was still with my ex husband and he financially supported our family.

She has minimal bills (car payment, phone, car insurance) and to be frank, has the financially maturity of a 16-18y/o.

She's a 25-year-old woman and for her to demand that her sister share a bedroom with two children so that she can have another bedroom for herself then not even be willing to pay her share of the rent is pretty obnoxious. It sounds like your sister might have boundary issues and you have a hard time saying no? I hope you do what's best for you cuz you have two young children to think of and they need a mom who is in a good head space.

Staying in a abusive marriage for 12 years and having two kids? Absolutely get some of the blame.\n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t she?", "Lol what? I literally took responsibility by getting out. You know nothing about me or my circumstances. This has nothing to do with my ex-husband and my poor choices from 10+ years ago. If you\u2019re gonna judge me, at least make it make sense.", "I asked you why you stayed with an abusive guy for three years and then had two kids with him and stayed for another seven or eight years.

Make it make sense.", "Not that I need to explain myself to yet another man, but when you\u2019re a young mom, with no family\nto rely on, and no financial control\u2026 with a special needs child on top of it, it\u2019s pretty hard to leave. I left as soon as my kids were ok enough for me to get my shit together financially. Not everybody has a fast/supported way out.

Charge her 1/3 of the rent and 1/3 of all utilities (she's using them so she needs to pay for them) and split all household chores. Make these rules clear before you sign a new lease. I'd even suggest to put these payment and chores rules into a written contract between you and your sister. She's old enough to take responsibility and learn how to \"adult\".

Personally, I'd rather deal with the tighter budget and allow the kids to have their own space.   This sounds like it's going to get seriously overcrowded and unpleasant really fast.   And in a few years, you're dealing with puberty and honestly...sharing a room with mom is only viable for another year or so.  \n\n\nIn fact, by the time the older one is 12, Im anticipating that each of them gets the bedrooms and you're going to have to use a pull out couch in the living room.

And, usually, rent is split by the bedrooms, e.g. 4br house with one larger bedroom, would be 22.5-23% for the regular rooms and 31-32.5% for the larger.

Your rent at the current place is $2,300 and your rent at the new place is $1,979. You say you can\u2019t afford the current place even with her $425 a month contribution. With her contribution you have been responsible for paying $1,875. You do realize if you no longer lived with her in the new place (which you say you can do) you\u2019d still owe over $100 more than what you\u2019re currently struggling to pay, right? Unless there are other huge savings that come with the move (utilities, for example) or unless you\u2019re worried she may one day move out suddenly and you\u2019ll be stuck paying the entire $2,300, this is only a move that saves you money if your sister comes along and it is a move that poses other huge inconveniences like you sharing a room with two children. \n\nIf you truly can afford the $1,979 on your own, then it makes sense to ask her to move out with appropriate notice. There are simply too many of you for a two bedroom to be feasible and sharing with your children is a terrible idea if you can afford otherwise. You\u2019ve given her a home for a long time with cheap rent, she should have savings at this point. It doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s contributing much else to the home aside from money you say you don\u2019t need and it does sound like having her there is actually a hassle. \n\nHowever, it is important to realize that if it is just you and your children in the new place, you\u2019re actually going to owe more each month in rent than you do right now in your current place. What makes you positive you can afford that cost when it is higher than what you\u2019re currently struggling to afford? \n\nIs it too late to ask her to pay more to stay in the current place and ensure a lease that means she can\u2019t run out on you? It sounds like the place you\u2019re in is more comfortable/ spacious and if you tell her she\u2019ll either have to get her own place while you move into a cheaper place or contribute more she\u2019ll likely chose to contribute more. Her contributing something like $700-$800 a month toward the house you\u2019re in is actually the cheapest option for you based on those rent numbers. If the rent is $2,300 and she gives you $800 then you\u2019re paying $1,500 and not sharing a bedroom with your children. $700-$800 for a place where she has her own bedroom and bathroom and isn\u2019t required to do any chores or pay utilities is probably still cheaper than any other option she has. Honestly you could charge her enough, reasonably, to outsource work to take the physical load of caring for a larger place off your plate and/or you could also insist she do more to be able to stay. A frank discussion with her about what it would take financially from her to stay may go a lot further then you think, especially because I doubt she wants to move from a house with two kids to a two bedroom apartment with two kids or have to find a place on her own or with housemates who won\u2019t bend to her comfort in the way you\u2019re doing. Many people in her shoes would pay considerably more to stay in the house you\u2019re in and avoid having to move to that apartment or be forced to find a new place. Have you given her that option? \n\nThere is no solution where her moving with you to a two bedroom apartment you can afford on your own and getting her own room there while you share with the kids is the best option, no matter how much she pays.\n\nIf you don\u2019t need a roommate, living on your own and not sharing a bedroom and bathroom with your kids in a place you can afford just makes sense. It\u2019s not fair to your kids to prioritize your sister\u2019s needs over theirs. It\u2019s not fair to you to deprioritize your own mental health to such an extent, and a two bedroom apartment is simply not a long-term solution for all of you given your children\u2019s ages anyway. Keeping your sister around only makes sense for you if it is financially advantageous, which you\u2019re saying it\u2019s not. That said, I am confused as to how you think you can afford it on your own when it actually will come down to more money than what you\u2019re struggling to pay now. With her current contribution your rent right now is cheaper then the new place will be without her contribution. Really, the main advantage of downsizing at this point is that you have a reason not to live with her anymore. But, if you are still living with her, staying where you are is the cheaper option.\n\nNow, one other idea if you are determined to live with her: is it possible to turn that oversized garage into a bedroom for her? She can have the garage (perhaps with space heaters) and use of a bathroom. Your kids can share a bedroom, and you can have the master. That\u2019s a much more reasonable arrangement for the small fraction of rent she\u2019s paying and one where she has the option to save for her own place and can move out anytime if you can afford the rent on your own.", "Nta I would  however  not get her to move with you. Sooner or later SHE needs  to grow up and stay on her feet alone and your children  need their room too.", "Yeah it\u2019s not a long term plan, I just want a year to save and to lighten my load with the house upkeep. I plan on moving after a year into a house or bigger townhome/apartment. I do agree, I\u2019m gonna pitch the 1/3 option and also ask for more help around the house. And then if that doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019m ok in the 2 bedroom financially.", "I'm confused. Rent was 2300, your sister paid 400, so you paid 1900. You got into debts. New rent is 1900 and you don't need her anymore?", "Your relationship is in desperate need of restructuring anyway. I wouldn\u2019t define it as a good relationship if she takes advantage of you and you just roll over and let her. At this point, you\u2019re putting her needs above your children. Your children need to come first! All three of you in a room together isn\u2019t fair to anyone. Esp as they\u2019re approaching the age where they need their own space.", "You have a good relationship\u2026 yet mentioned all the ways she doesn\u2019t help you with simple tasks\n\nPerhaps some rethinking from a different perspective is in order, no?", "Your sister will just have to find a new roommate. It happens. It should be no big deal.", "Rent is 2300 base not including any utilities or extra house costs like pest control, gardening, etc. I ran the numbers and the extra house costs and difference in utilities is roughly $600. But I\u2019m overwhelmed with caring for a house and that\u2019s a big motivator for me to downsize too. I should add I live in vegas so utilities here can get insane in a house.", "You literally cannot afford to keep the current situation going. That\u2019s it. Period. It\u2019s not personal, it\u2019s financial. And moreover, your obligation is to YOUR CHILDREN, who should NOT have to share a room with their mom while their aunt had her own space, nor should they be doing without because their mom can\u2019t afford to subsidize their aunt anymore. \n\nCircumstances have changed. That\u2019s all you need to say. The ONLY obligation you have is to let her know you will not be renewing the lease with as much notice as possible so that she can find other accommodations. Or propose an alternative that will work. But, honestly, she doesn\u2019t sound responsible with money, so I would caution against making any commitments on the premise that she will consistently pay her new, larger share."]}
