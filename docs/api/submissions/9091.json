I left my husband March of last year and stayed in our 3 bedroom/2 bath home out of desperation/fear of not getting approved for other housing even though it was not easy for me financially. I\u2019ve been surviving and able to pay our $2300 rent but slowly slipping into more debt. Our lease is up end of April and I have made the decision to leave the house and downsize to an apartment to save money and take the physical load of caring for a house off of my plate. My 25F sister lives with me and has been paying $425 in rent since March of 2021. She moved in with us when I was still with my ex husband and he financially supported our family. When I decided to leave my husband, I didn\u2019t raise her rent. She makes around $16.50/hr working full time hours. She has minimal bills (car payment, phone, car insurance) and to be frank, has the financially maturity of a 16-18y/o. She doesn\u2019t help me with house chores even after asking her several times over the years, maybe she does the dishes like once a month. \n\nAnyway, our new place is a 2 bedroom 2 bath apartment with an oversized garage. I chose this place because it is still zoned for my kids school and it\u2019s important to me to keep them within our community. Rent is $1979. The plan is for me to share a room with my kids and for her to have the other room. The more I think about this, the more I feel weird about the fact that my 25y/o single sister is going to be getting 1/2 my apartment and paying 21% of the rent. I had the idea to increase her rent to $660 which is 33% of the rent. But my friends and family still don\u2019t think that\u2019s enough. I\u2019m not asking her to live with me, and she\u2019s made it clear she won\u2019t share a room with either of my kids, which I understand honestly. They aren\u2019t her kids. \n\nI know she won\u2019t/can\u2019t live on her own. I don\u2019t want to make her broke, but I don\u2019t feel this is fair either. \n\nAITA for raising the rent to $660 or am I enabling her to stay mentally 18 for the rest of her life? Or am I being reasonable?\n\nETA she has her own room here at this house and primary use of the guest bathroom.

Thats the kind of bone you\u2019d throw to a young student without a job or life.\n\nWhile i\u2019s normallt say 50/50, i can see that you having kids as well will severely limit your options of replacing her with someone else to split rent.  1/3rd rent - discounted for the fact that you have kids and she doesnt - seems pretty reasonable to me.\n\nBut your sister is not an asshole either.

The idea that you're going to have a two bedroom two bath apartment and she will have her own bedroom but isn't paying around half the rent is insane. If she was also getting her own bathroom then she should pay half the rent. If she has to share the bathroom with your kids then maybe around 40%. You're a single mom with two kids it's not your job to support your sister. You obviously have more than enough on your plate and your family should be ashamed for burdening you with even more responsibility.

As a single mom you have to think about you and your family first. $660 would be incredibly fair and would help you out a lot.

Please do not put yourself in a stressful situation when she\u2019s already proven to you she\u2019s not a good housemate (not washing her dishes, not being nice to your 8 year old daughter, etc).

It may be better for everyone for you to give her notice to find her own place.", "NTA! I don't understand her not being the one to reach out and say she wants to help *you*! That seems like what a sister would do if you're struggling.", "You need to stop subsidizing your sister to the detriment of your children. The three of you sharing a room while she pays less than 1/3 of all the rent & utilities is  hurting your children. It would be better for them to share a room. Your sister is an adult and can find roommates. NTA", "You need to stop prioritizing your sister over your kids. Says a daughter who's mother would have done the same.

My daughter would end up being anxious and sad sharing a room with her.", "Yeah I\u2019m realizing that it is crazy", "Well the thing is.. I don\u2019t NEED a roommate. She asked to live with me.

That\u2019s why I struggle with this.", "Meh, I agree that OP is NTA. But it's completely reasonable that individual rooms with more/less people have different portions of the rent. More people in one room also means more people using common areas. For example, three people take up a lot more time in the bathroom than one. It makes sense for every individual to pay to occupy the apartment in its entirety, not just based on what room they're sleeping in.", "I\u2019ve never had her pay any utilities or other house costs", "\"*and you could have your own quiet space.\"*\n\nas a mom with 2 kids around the age OP's kids are (plus one toddler, but not factoring that little human into this particular statement), i audibly giggled at this.", "I should have mentioned, I am only planning on having this set up for a year and then moving back into a bigger space/maybe house if I am ready. I just need a reset financially and I am drowning in housework. So this is somewhat temporary. She won\u2019t move out if I ask her. At least not for a while.

For your own well-being you would be so much happier than having to share your bedroom with two children. I think that would have take a toll on anybody's mental health.", "This will help her in the long run, especially if you both don't have anyone outside of each other to rely on, don't treat it like some punishment or thing.\n\nBe frank about things, break down costs and explain that her having half the apartment is more than fair for what you're asking of her. \n\nSounds like you have a solid relationship, she just needs to step in a bit more.

This is why she is financially stunted!", "I mean she won\u2019t have a choice if you don\u2019t renew the lease for the apartment, she will have to move out. If you\u2019re not planning on charging her utilities, then increase the rent! This is your time to save, whatever she doesn\u2019t pay comes out of your pocket, and essentially your kids financial stability. I would also establish some ground rules, as far as cleaning!

Thank you.", "Oh for ffs, get lost.", "So you\u2019re saying the one year of paying for our housing while I did all the housework and raised our children, makes up for 12 years of abuse? Exactly how much money is enough to stay in an abusive relationship?", "If it would destroy your relationship to stop letting her take advantage of you, then you don't have a healthy one in the first place. \n\nIf she wants to stay, she should pay half the bills. Rent, utilities, food (not necessarily full half of that because you and your kids eat more of it, but some), everything. Tell her that she's an adult and it's time you treated her like one, instead of like a child you're bringing up... that you respect her enough not to feel she needs to be treated like a child anymore. (It should even be true.)", "You're a mother of two young children and she's putting even more strain on you by demanding to live with you without paying her share of the rent. She's thinking only of herself. If telling her that you need a place for yourself and your children destroys your relationship then there was something really wrong to begin with. She's a 25-year-old woman and for her to demand that her sister share a bedroom with two children so that she can have another bedroom for herself then not even be willing to pay her share of the rent is pretty obnoxious. It sounds like your sister might have boundary issues and you have a hard time saying no? I hope you do what's best for you cuz you have two young children to think of and they need a mom who is in a good head space. And I don't think it would be easy to be in that kind of space if you're stuck sharing a room with your two kids. Good luck to you.", "if the only reason she is good with you is for the roof over her head then she is a user and not genuinely caring about you.   I would  either make her pay half or state change in circumstance which is reasonable given the smaller property you have x days to move out", "You can have a good relationship with your children or a good relationship with your sister; it appears you can\u2019t do both.  Your children aren\u2019t adults, but your sister is, the choice should be to raise your children, not another adult.  NTA is you move without your sister.", "No problem, have a good one.", "You\u2019re three people to a room and she\u2019s not paying half the rent? She needs to pay half the rent. Or, she gets to share a room with the children, as she too is being supported like she\u2019s a child. Lol", "You put up with at least three years of abuse and still decided to have two children with this guy?", "Thank you. Yeah, I know I\u2019m enabling her and I don\u2019t say no enough. I just needed to hear it from somebody that wasn\u2019t emotionally involved.", "Something tells me you\u2019ve never been a 19 year old woman", "Yikes dude way to blame the victim", "You had a 50/50 chance of getting that right. Not really sure what your point is.  Always with the excuses. No one can ever take responsibility for their poor decisions.\n\nYou had no business getting married, much less bringing two children into the world, if you didn\u2019t know how to think for yourself.", "Absolutely! Staying in a abusive marriage for 12 years and having two kids? Absolutely get some of the blame.\n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t she?", "Lol what? I literally took responsibility by getting out. You know nothing about me or my circumstances. This has nothing to do with my ex-husband and my poor choices from 10+ years ago. If you\u2019re gonna judge me, at least make it make sense.", "I asked you why you stayed with an abusive guy for three years and then had two kids with him and stayed for another seven or eight years. And you just made an excuse that you were 19 years old. That\u2019s not \u201ctaking responsibility\u201c lol. Make it make sense.", "Not that I need to explain myself to yet another man, but when you\u2019re a young mom, with no family\nto rely on, and no financial control\u2026 with a special needs child on top of it, it\u2019s pretty hard to leave. I left as soon as my kids were ok enough for me to get my shit together financially. Not everybody has a fast/supported way out. So yeah my 19 year old decisions led to me having two kids with an abusive man. And again.. this is not even the point of this post. So now that I\u2019ve given you way too much of my energy, have a great night."]}
