This 'shitty friend' spent hours listening to you 'talking through it to her' (*to* her not *with* her, in your words).  Then she set aside time for a Netflix session which you bailed on.  I think by day three she was entitled to want to pass the baton to some other friends as she probably had other things in her life that also need attention.", "In my opinion, YTA. You definitely deserve friends who will help you through your issues, especially in emotional times like these. However, it is unfair to expect her to be readily available anytime to work through your problems, while most likely she has her own, as any person does. I\u2019ve been on the receiving end of friends in tough spots who definitely need more than a friend to work through their problems, and sometimes it becomes excessive, especially as a person who keeps their issues private, so to her it would have looked like I was just being selfish, but really I was dealing with a lot! Your friend clearly cares about you, seeing as she had her friends apparently check in on you. I don\u2019t think you should act on your anger toward your friend, once everything has calmed down you will see it from a better perspective.", "Yeah YTA. Based on how dramatically you dealt with her setting boundaries around her time, it\u2019s not surprising she feels you were \u201ctoo much\u201d. It\u2019s not that she didn\u2019t want to be there for you. It\u2019s just that she couldn\u2019t run her own mental health ragged for it. Your expectations of her were unfair. \n\nLearn how to lean on your friends in appropriate ways, don\u2019t beat yourself up if it takes a few experiences, such as this one, to figure out what that means. Pay attention to their needs and feelings too. You\u2019ll get it eventually. Take a deep breath. Don\u2019t make it the end of the world or the end of a friendship when it doesn\u2019t have to be. \n\nDon\u2019t overreact by deciding you can never vent to a friend or seek support again. If that\u2019s your impulse, seek therapy because you need to be able to handle making mistakes and growing.", "I can sympathise with how you feel and everything you are going through. But your friend is not an AH for letting you know that she does not have capacity to hold your life drama at this time. She may have other problems on her plate.\n\nIn contrast to which, you\u2019ve slandered her to mutual friends.\n\nIf you honestly think it through, and read your own story back, you\u2019ll see that YTA.", "YTA, she can't stop her life to live yours. She tried to be with you, but you being unstable and changing plans is draining on her. She is right to prioritize her own mental health.", "YTA\n\nHow is she a coward and a shitty friend?\n\nI get how you are a shitty friend, calling her names and bad mouthing her. \n\nAll she did was say she needed some space because you were acting unstable. After all, you had been awake for 2 days straight, constantly texting and abruptly changing plans. She even had her friends check on you. \n\nOnly person showing any cowardice here is you. Since you are the one who \"checked into an awful AirBnB in a bad part of town.\"", "It's interesting that Emily did EXACTLY what adults should do - she set a boundary in a kind way. And you respond by passive-aggressively rebuffing her attempts as to contacting you then calling her names behind her back.\n\nYou are the bad friend. You are the Coward, And YTA.", "Leaning YTA. It\u2019s one thing to call or text and vent immediately after (or even on other days) but expecting hours and hours is yeah, too much. Most people want to support friends but don\u2019t have that much time or emotional capacity available. You have to be thoughtful as well. Just because text is this immediate thing doesn\u2019t mean we should expect immediate responses, an all day chat, or to be able to reschedule something immediately the next day if we need to cancel it.", "Here's a life lesson:  you cannot use other people as your emotional garbage cans.   Even your best friends don't want to spend hour after hour being dumped on.   (I wish I'd learned this a lot earlier myself, frankly.)", "YTA. Judging by your post and answers here, no wonder she set boundaries. You sound emotionally draining.", "YTA.  You flaked on your friend once already on the watch party.  She has asked you to respect her time and emotional health.  She may have clued in your other friends on your situation but she cared enough to find support for you.  Emily is not your emotional support pillow and she knows that.\n\nYou may be in pain, but your response makes it hard to empathize with you.", "YTA. You asked for her time, she gave it to you, you bailed because you decided to prioritize something else. That was shitty! Then you trash-talked her to your mutual friends via text. Even worse!\n\nIt's clear you're prioritizing your pain over everyone else's time. It sucks you're going through a breakup, but you can't expect everyone to drop everything to help you through it if you're not going to value the time they're willing to commit to it. As a rule, I hate it when people cite \"boundaries\" to get out of even mildly inconveniencing themselves. It doesn't seem like that's what your friend is doing here, so there ya go.", "YTA. Not because you wanted to talk to her, something terrible happened, but because of the way you went about it. You expected her to just take care of you, forgetting that she has a life, plans, work, etc. that she needs to handle too. You also bailed on her because you wanted to sleep, which is fine, but it can\u2019t be the world according to OP\u2019s timeline and everyone else is just supposed to fall in line. She set boundaries, which is what she is supposed to do. She was trying to have healthy communication with you, and you blew that way out of proportion. She tried to have other people reach out to you, showing she cared, just did not have the spoons to deal with it. I\u2019ve told my friends that i don\u2019t have the mental capacity to hear about their problems today. It happens.", "Ugh you do sounds like a lot and it sort of seems like you love the drama and being the center of it while everyone falls in line to make you happy. YTA. There is nothing wrong with setting boundaries and removing toxicity from one\u2019s life.", "YTA and very needy. I had a friend like you that just sucked the air out of the room. She's not your therapist, or sounding board. Put your big girl panties on.", "YTA. . . She set healthy boundaries with you. And although you felt the need to be tended to it can be very draining to others. Setting a limit on how much of her time and energy she devotes to your emotions is actually great for both of you. It gives her some personal space in this, and subconsciously teaches you to not feel too reliant on others, or demanding too much from others. Remember: the boundaries are not for you, she set them up to protect herself from over use.", "YTA \n\nDamn. She talked to you for TWO DAYS. She organized a watch party and you bailed. \n\nYou pretty much need to make sure the world revolves around you! Right? \n\nYou\u2019re absolutely the asshole here. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t owe you all her time to fix you", "Looks to me like Emily tried to be there for you, and then even asked other people to check in with you to feel supported, but it still wasn\u2019t enough. And then you shat all over her. YTA", "YTA this was an embarrassing overeaction, especially from a grown woman, I think you need to reflect on your behaviour and apologise both to your friend and to the mutual friend she got to check on you, no one here was being malicious or meaning any harm, except you, who lashed out in a very childish manner.", "YTA. As a 34 year old working adult I\u2019m on your friends side", "Yta you can\u2019t force one person to be your everything. She let you know she couldn\u2019t be your support 2 days in a row. The fact she then ask her friends to reach out after you were upset shows that she is a caring friend. I get the feeling that you  maybe are too much for one person to handle and the minute they can\u2019t do it all you see it as a rejection and then punish them. I think that\u2019s what has happened here. \n\nAlso her wording makes it seem like she talked to a therapist or crafted the message so this probably hasn\u2019t been the first time this happened.", "YTA. You sound extremely high maintenance", "Hope I\u2019m not this miserable and selfish when I\u2019m at 30. How entitled and the audacity. YTA", "YTA. You simply can\u2019t expect people to drop everything in their life to accommodate you. Your friend did make an effort the first night it happened, you decided to cancel, and then when she couldn\u2019t make time again threw a tantrum. I\u2019m not surprised she tapped out for her own mental health, the tone of your post and comments alone is mentally exhausting for me and I don\u2019t even know you. Very sorry this happened to you, cheating sucks, but you did not handle this situation properly. I\u2019d recommend apologizing to your friend and explaining how distraught you were, and telling her you won\u2019t act like this again, that may be the only way to salvage this friendship based on how selfishly and immature you acted.", "Leaning YTA. You\u2019re leaving out the extent to which you we\u2019re communicating with her, which to you may have been a normal amount given the intensity of the situation, but maybe was over and above what she could offer at the time. I have been through many of my (30\u2019s) friends\u2019 breakups and it is a WHIRLWIND you get trapped into and you don\u2019t see it until it\u2019s passed. \n\nYou don\u2019t know (or say) what was going on in her life at the time. Maybe she has been dealing with work stress and a deadline that she missed because she was up talking to you (or took an extended lunch break if it was during the day like it kind of sounds). Maybe she and her partner or parents or other friends have been arguing and she\u2019s emotionally spent. \n\nIn a couple days after you can clear your mind, you can apologize to mend this.", "Soft YTA. It\u2019s understandable that you would want your best friend there for you after a devastating breakup. But sometimes people don\u2019t have it to give. It could be something going on in her own life. She may want to be there for you, but just can\u2019t in the way you\u2019re hoping. \n\nSounds like she was there for a whole night for you, reached out since then, has been thinking of you, and is doing her best. Calling her a coward and a shitty friend is uncalled for and, imo, unfair.\n\nIt\u2019s a hard lesson that sometimes we can\u2019t always get the support we need from those in our lives. It sucks, but it\u2019s the reality.", "Maybe a therapist would be helpful, since they get paid to listen to you", "YTA- I understand the feeling of being \u201ctoo much\u201d and sympathize completely. But your friend did not abandon you. She dedicated three entire days of her life to being there for you fully. By the fourth day she is well and entitled to tell you that she needs a bit of a break. You are very concerned about your hurt and the pain going on in your life with no care and regard for what might be going on with her at home, something she has no obligation to share with you either btw, it is enough for her to simply tell you that she needs a break. And despite you being a jerk to her she tried to still make sure you were okay from a far and your response to this was to call her a shitty friend. The only shitty friend here is you. You care about YOUR hurt and feelings and fuck whatever she might be going through.", "You still seem unstable. YTA.", "YTA.  And hey, if she's such a coward and so shitty, you should be happy to realize she's probably not your friend anymore.", "YTA\n\nAs sad as your situation is Emily is still an adult with a life, work and responsibilities. She can just drop everything and text with you for half a day, that\u2019s not how real life works. \n\nThen you make plans and cancel. Like she was supposed to just be okay with that and rearrange another full day to talk to you. Again: she is an adult with work and things to do. You are not the center of her universe \n\nShe isn\u2019t capable of juggling her life and yours right now she made a choice and put herself first", "YTA - she put her life on hold for you 2 nights in a row, the second of which you flaked on. What more do you want?!? She was there for you and you kept taking and taking so she stepped away.", "YTA. If my friend called me all those things I wouldn\u2019t be their friend anymore.", "YTA for trauma dumping on your best friend and then getting mad when she unsurprisingly was uncomfortable with it.", "YTA\n\nyou trauma dumped and relied on her too much. Trauma dumping is fine as long as it\u2019s both ways but it can be a lot for one person to deal with. There\u2019s being there for you in a tough spot vs actually trauma dumping all your baggage on one poor person, at that point you need to go to a professional", "You are not owed therapy from your friends.   \nYTA.", "YTA. Friends are our support systems and they are there for us when we need it but they have to have a limit and they should be able to express that without you turning on them.

Don\u2019t expect her to be there for you at all if this is the attitude you have", "YTA, she tried to support when she could and when that failed she sent support to you via common friends. You sound very vain and self absorbed. GROW UP.", "YTA. \n\nI get it, break ups suck. It's even worse when you're in a foreign country and don't know anyone. However, your friend is responsible for her own wellbeing before yours. \n\nYour friend has made it clear that her cup is empty. She feels like she is responsible for your happiness. Is it possible that you lean on her a bit too much? \n\nYes, friends should help each other. But please keep in mind that she's not a therapist or crisis intervention counselor.

Reading this took a toll on my mental health. Give Emily a break. You\u2019re too needy, flake out in a movie night, and maybe this is why your bf cheated on you.", "YTA\n \nYou must expect and learn to honor boundaries.  Therapy may be helpful.

You sound exhausting and needy.", "YTA\n\nYour 30, not 13. People have lives outside you", "YTA. She set a reasonable boundary respecting her mental health and then came back when she had the emotional and mental bandwidth to support you. If anything, that was courageous. It\u2019s hard to tell a friend you need space from their emotional needs\u2014I just had this conversation with my partner, who\u2019s been work-dumping on me daily for over a month to the point I started crying over HIS stress while dealing with a pile of my own that I had been unable to work through. \u201cI want you to feel comfortable venting to me, but I also need you to check that I\u2019m in a good mental state to absorb your stress and anxiety.\u201d If anything, your response was passive aggressive and cowardly. \u201cYou said you needed space so I\u2019m giving it to you. I don\u2019t want to worry about being \u2018too much\u2019.\u201d Talk about emotionally immature, but I\u2019ll chalk that up to the fresh pain of your breakup. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to stop processing our own raw emotions to allow space for other people. But other people are not trash cans to dump your stress into, and their emotional needs also have to be respected even if it\u2019s not ideal for you\u2014you are not the only person in the equation.

You're exhausting.", "YTA. Being overwhelmed doesn\u2019t wait for the right timing. Emily got overwhelmed. It was not something she could control. Feeling hurt and upset after your heartbreak is also out of your control to a degree, but how you acted towards your friend was fully within your control. You were shitty to her. You don\u2019t get a hall pass to be shitty just because you are going through difficult times. Maybe she is too. You don\u2019t know what all is on her plate right now. It doesn\u2019t matter, though, it\u2019s not a competition. Respecting her when she needs to take a step back (and she informed you quite politely btw) is what a good friend would\u2019ve done. Find someone else to talk to during that time. Don\u2019t put all your troubles on one person\u2019s shoulders. And don\u2019t lash out at people when you\u2019re upset. This is how you ruin friendships. \n\nYou owe her and the others who were messaging you an apology.", "Soft YTA.

No one else can do it for you.", "YTA, but as said in other places,  a soft YTA.  \n\n\nI'll leave an analogy that might better explain things. When trying to help someone who is drowning, you have to be very very careful, as all too often those drowning end up drowning their rescuer with them as they lash out and flail in terror and panic.  \n\n\nIt is the same  when you seek to help those drowning in pain and grief, and this is what is happening here. You're hurting, and feeling wounded and vulnerable so you're lashing out in panic and despair at your friend. From your own post and replies, she DID come to your aid, several times over several days.  She didn't abandoned you, and she did stop her world to help you, she just wasn't able to stop it indefinitely.  That is why she set up healthy boundaries, and still continued to check up on you.  Drowning together isn't going to help the situation. NAH for this part btw, you're in pain, and Emily is helping as she can.  \n\n\nSo where are YTA, albeit a soft asshole? Calling her a coward and shitty friend.  Remember, words said in anger, and words said in grief, cannot be taken back. Emily was there for you, and from the sounds of it, is still there for you. When you're in a better spot, hopefully you will see that.", "Soft yta.  It kind of sounds like she is going through something herself right now.  She wasn't in the right headspace to be a comfort for you.  Sending others to check on you seems like she cares about you but was in a bad place also.

And honestly, given what they told you about her being busy \u2026 I think that these others friends either know something else is going on with Emily OR know that Emily doesn\u2019t actually have the ability to provide this type of support and are stepping up to help you \u2026. And you got snotty with them rather than appreciate the support. You owe those other women an apology", "NTA. I actually have a friend like that as well. It's all good when she needs emotional support, etc, but when it's the other way around, it's too emotionally taxing on her, or she offers advice that is not helpful. Apparently, she believes she is an empath. Just relegate that friendship to happy topics only and reach out to someone more caring in your times of need.", "She has a right to look out for her own mental health, but the way she communicated that was cruel.", "NTA she can be a good friend for a couple days. If she cant drop her ass. God reddit hates doing anything to help someone else its embarrassing", "OP, I'm sorry so many people are being harsh and telling you that a breakup isn't that big of a deal. That's an unfair thing to say as they know nothing about your relationship and your pain. \n\nI think your friend handled things poorly. Very poorly. No, you can't expect someone to drop everything anytime you need them, but I did not get the sense that you intended that at all. Instead, it seemed like you just wanted your friend to help while you were alone and heartbroken in a foreign country. \n\nI'm sorry for all the casual and cruel comments and I hope that you are on your way toward healing. You deserve better friends and a better boyfriend.", "Uh, I\u2019m shocked by all the Y T A votes.\n\nI\u2019d say, NAH. \n\nA break up sucks, especially one in that happens in a scenario like this.\n\nYou reached out to a friend, probably a mess (understandably so), and probably laid a lot of emotion on her.\n\nShe\u2019s not wrong for needing a break or not feeling up to supporting you with the Netflix watch that day.\n\nBut like, what exactly changed in one day? Why did she have to word it in such a harsh, mean way?\n\nIf I had been her, and not been in the mood to comfort an obviously distraught friend, I\u2019d just say \u201chey, it\u2019s been a really long day and I\u2019m not sure I can be the support you need tonight. Can we reschedule tomorrow?\u201d\n\nThere are nice ways to turn a friend down.\n\nYou aren\u2019t wrong to feel hurt by her response, though I do think all the drama afterwards is a bit unnecessary.\n\nI think, once the break up has processed, you need to evaluate your friendship with her - not because she did anything wrong, but because I think something else is going on here.\n\nHer reaction seems like someone who never gets to share her feelings with you. Is she always comforting you? Is she always listening to your problems? Do you make sure you ask her about her life? Do you give her a chance to open up?\n\nMaybe the answer is yes, and this was just a bad day for everyone. But, maybe she\u2019s been feeling like the friendship is emotionally one-sided and this was her breaking point.\n\nBut again, I don\u2019t think her response was the way to handle this, I don\u2019t think your response to her friends was right, but I don\u2019t think either of you are AHs. It just sounds like too much emotion in too short of a timeframe.\n\nI hope you two can work through this!!\n\n*edit: fixed some grammar", "NTA I feel like Emily's reaction would have made more sense if you'd been venting to her for a week or more. But it sounds like you were only venting for less than a day?", "JFC your 30, not 18. You should be totally capable of being alone in a city and handling your own break up. You friend Emily doesn't need to bend over backwards for you, she has her own life and her own shit. Not once did you even indicate that you care about anything she's dealing with. It's all about you. No wonder she has to set boundaries wtfh you. Grow up. YTA.", "So your good friend was honest with you that she couldn\u2019t meet your needs right now, but she still cared enough for you to try and find other people to help you out.\n\nYou\u2019re ungrateful and demanding.\n\nYou are the shitty friend.\n\nYTA", "She couldn't support you for the first 72 hours of a bad breakup that was throwing your life into chaos, and was mad you cancelled on a remote movie watching evening because you are exhausted? Unless you're omitting some critical details/backstory that would justify her reaction, that's not best friend behavior.  NTA.", "I mean, she also tried again and OP refused. \"So be there, but also no, I won't have you\" just builds on the issue.", "Maybe I didn't write my post very well, I don't expect her to be there \"anytime\" I need her. This all happened within 48 hours of a very sudden breakup and I can't help but feel you try to be there for the people you love immediately after something life-altering like that happens", "I don't disagree about leaning on people in appropriate ways, however this was one of the hardest times in my life, and she was only able to be there for me for one day. I never meant to burden anyone with my problems and haven't really talked to anyone very much about the breakup since it happened (in May), but I don't think it's excessive to expect your closest friend to be there for you the first couple days after a BU especially considering all the extenuating circumstances like being stuck alone in his city", "Me being unstable a day after a huge life event? Am I really crazy to think friends are supposed to be there for each other during the hard time, especially RIGHT when the hard times happen? I would never abandon a friend who's going through something that hard because texting for half a day with them was \"too much\"", "OP is an emotional vampire. \n\nI had a friend like this. Ever since I dropped her as a friend my life is so much happier. People like this suck the life out of you. \n\nNote how she came on here asking if she\u2019s the AH and refusing to accept EVERYONE telling her that she is! Main Character Syndrome", "Makes you wonder about her a person and potential partner. Is she this selfish and self centered as a girlfriend?", "Yeah honestly I also get a little annoyed when a friend is leaning on me a bit tooooo much - but Jesus Christ there's a way to be honest without being so weird an impersonal. And it's so normal to need support after something so shitty. Idk - Feeling a little crazy reading these responses.", "Honey. No one as to go out of their way to make themselves available to you if you act entitled to their time.", "I agree. Feel insane reading these comments. \"Dont you know people in their 30s don't have time for friendships?! Have some boundaries!\" Honestly if the friend couldnt be there - thats one thing. But the friend seemed to go out of her way to say OP was \"too much\" etc. IE it's not about the friend, but implies OP was WRONG to dare message her in her time of need, how dare she not carefully craft and schedule messages with her friend in mind while shes having a massive emotional crisis. The friend not only wasnt there for her but went out of her way to make the crisis WORSE. She is a shit friend. OP it doesn't feel good but you're better off.", "A break-up sucks but it\u2019s totally unreasonable to expect specific people to be at your beck and call in the aftermath of one, even for 48 hours.", "I feel like this is still a situation of expecting her to be readily available. Of course sitting and listening, and helping with what they can is expected for a friend, but sometimes people can be going through things in their own lives, and your friend was good to express her boundaries openly to you. I am sorry for your situation.", "She did. And then you broke plans. \n\nAnd then you demanded more time and it so happened she couldn't. \n\nAnd then she reached out and you blew her off.", "She isn\u2019t responsible to manage your emotions for you", "no, it\u2019s way too much to expect someone to be there for you at the drop of a hat and for 48 hours straight. people have their own lives", "It\u2019s a break up, grow up. No one is going to take bereavement time to coddle a full grown woman. She let you talk and get it all out. She made plans to do more and YOU canceled. You are selfish to think she has to do more. She\u2019s not a therapist, she isn\u2019t here for you to dump all your emotional trauma on to.", "It sounded like she stayed up and was with you one of the nights. Then worked while you slept and she needed to sleep too. Am I getting the timeline correct?", "The way you are acting sounds unhinged. Have you thought this behavior pushed your ex to cheat on you?", "I've been where you are. I totally get it. But you're also cutting off your nose to spite your face. When she DID come back and expressed concern and care for you, you opted not to take it. That's ok, but it sounds like the only reason you did so was out of resentment that she took some space. I know you might say you really were anxious about being too much, and that might be true as well... but come on now, that's totally something someone with hurt feelings would do.  \"Oh well if I'm too much then I shouldn't talk to her at all!\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt seems like you're hurt because of her saying she felt responsible for your happiness, and also that she wasn't meeting your expectations of care and comfort that you want from a close friend. Adults with busy lives make it difficult to fully commit to long emotional sessions that easily. While you have every right to want your friends (and hope) that they'll be there for you, don't confuse your hopes with reasonable expectations. I personally think her wording reveals a little more about your patterns of behavior here than initially meets the eye. I would consider that you possibly ARE a lot to handle emotionally when you need support. Instead of being resentful at her, reflect a little and try and assess if it's true and reasonable. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy last point is about your reaction to others texting you. I totally totally totally get your feelings here. But calling her a shitty friend for following up with you in different ways after you've been shutting her out is not ok. She's actually the opposite of shitty for trying various means of reaching out to you when you essentially ghosted her because your feelings were hurt. That IS a really caring friend. Even then, you still aren't 100% sure that was the case either, so saying it with such confidence is really risky. If you're wrong, you look absolutely fucking nuts. Either way, not ok to call her things like that. I advise to understand that she's allowed to take care of herself too, and to learn to appreciate the care and time you are able to get, and not take things for granted.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like you were up for 10 mins of support if that\u2019s what she had. More like hours.", "You should count yourself lucky that you have a friend who could be there for you that day. She probably had things going on too and unexpectedly dedicating that time to you meant it was not going to other things. You don't know if she had a stressful work project, her own relationship issues, or was just tired and overwhelmed. Whatever she had going on, she put it aside but you're telling her that wasn't enough and you needed more of her time, energy, and attention. It sucks, but adulting sucks a lot of the time.", "She can be there for you for the first couple of days by spending an hour listening and talking to you, but it s a lot to ask to expect her to drop everything for the entire day. She might have a lot going on I her own life.", "Grow up", "I think what people are saying, is you didn\u2019t consider that your friend might have had other things going on - she might of had a high stress deadline at work, things going on with the kids (if she has kids), other issues you weren\u2019t aware of creating stress for her. \n\nShe was there for you to listen, but as others have said, there\u2019s only so much to say about such an event before you start going over old ground. \n\nIt is possible that the combination of listening to your challenges on top of what else might of been going on for your friend means she needed to put some boundaries up so she can get through whatever she needs to get through (ie the working week). That has obviously hurt your feelings, but you have to appreciate that your friends life does not revolve around you and she can\u2019t be there to listen to you all the time, even if it is just a day or two after the event.\n\nYour response to her was unnecessarily rude. YTA", "Yeah it\u2019d be nice to have a friend there constantly while you\u2019re dealing with something, but everyone\u2019s lives don\u2019t stop while you\u2019re having a crisis. People work, they have families, other friends, stresses and responsibilities and priorities that still require their attention.

Also, you then broke plans. Then you wanted plans again. She very well may have moved things around you didn't know about only to be blown off. \n\nAnd, it's ironic you say you'd never abandon a friend while treating yours like this?", "At 30 years old while people have jobs and other life things going on texting half a day is a lot. She didn\u2019t abandon you. Assuming she isn\u2019t a therapist, and if she did she would definitely need boundaries, you said yourself you processed everything by talking to her. That is a LOT for someone who wasn\u2019t in the relationship and also wasn\u2019t expecting to be emotionally needed so suddenly. Essentially your \u2018needs\u2019 put her time at your whim for 24-48 hours. You said you talked to her while it was raw.  You texted her half a day which was either a work day for her or a day off she spent focused on you. You cancelled because you needed sleep but it hasn\u2019t yet occurred to you that she may have had things going on that she set aside for you to process your feelings. It hasn\u2019t yet seemed to occur to you that she offered you a LOT of her time, of which many of us don\u2019t have much to spare, and then when she recognized she wouldn\u2019t be able to be the person you needed t vent to she asked others to check in on you where you then called her rude names as you lashed out. \n\nWhat did you expect her to do? Call in sick to work to spend 12 hours on the phone with you while you watch TV? Answer the phone any time you called regardless of time and what she had going? Cancel any of her plans, of which you may not be aware of, so that she could listen to you process again and again? Because that\u2019s what happens after break ups. You go over everything that happened from every angle to try and figure out what went wrong. You can only give so much advice for that. Not once in your post or your comment have you given any thought to what \u2018dropping everything\u2019 and being there for a friend costs that person. In this case, she recognized that it was costing her mental health and short of her taking on suffering to witness you suffer, she asked for some space. This was best case scenario. You blew it with your inability to step outside of yourself and consider others", "Oof I\u2019ve been your friend in this situation and it sucks. I have little doubt that you have probably complained/leaned on her a lot when you\u2019ve had other issues in your life which is why she set boundaries after another long \u201cprocessing\u201d session.\n\nNo one owes you their time and consoling a friend is draining. You don\u2019t know what your friend is going through, maybe she\u2019s in a bad headspace herself and needs to take care of herself.
