There is one student in my class who I am not particularly fond of. He\u2019s very bright, he just talks a lot and gets distracted easily, and as a result, distracts his classmates. Earlier today, he asked me if he could use the restroom, and I told him no, and that he should have used it earlier. He looked at me confused and left anyways. I was in disbelief. When he came back, I asked him why had he left when I told him he couldn\u2019t. He asked me if I expected him to hold it for the rest of class time, which would have been around half an hour. He also informed me that he never thought asking for the rest room was for permissions sake anyways, as no teacher had ever told him no. I didn\u2019t really care for his excuses, so I told him he was being disobedient and would call his mother. He shrugged and said she\u2019d be on his side anyways. I called her and she asked was there a specific reason I wouldn\u2019t let him go. I responded no, and she said she would have walked out too, and to stop being so petty and controlling as to not let near adults use the restroom. This annoyed me, and I later asked my husband about it. He also asked my reason for not letting him go, and upon not providing one, also sided with the student. I\u2019m very confused by this; students should respect a teacher\u2019s authority.

Look, I'm getting downvoted in another standing up for a teacher, but you've been asked 3 times why and if all you can bring is \"respect authority\" then YTA. Otherwise, this reads that you denied him just cause you don't like him. Whats the instructive/maturation reason for denial?", "So please tell us who the fuck you are to tell someone to control their bodily functions??? \n\nSounds like you just don't like the kid. \n\nYTA - no one likes teachers like you", "YTA.  He may have had a truly urgent need to use the bathroom at that moment.

They should have peed on the floor? Do you understand that bathrooms in schools can be crowded and sometimes you can't use it in the very short time between classes?", "YTA. You should not refuse a student's reasonable request to use the restroom. It reads as you really refused because you don't like the kid. If he had caused issues with restroom breaks before I might could understand, but this doesn't seem to be the case. \n\nKids are not dumb. This kid knows you don't like him and trying to demand respect is going to backfire. If he's as bright as you say, he's likely bored and should be moved to an advanced class.", "YTA.  Holding it in too long is known to have health problems, and it sounds like you're just on a pointless power trip that you need to work on if you're intending on staying in teaching", "YTA. Bodily functions are not optional. Power tripping is. Make a better choice next time. Something tells me you might not", "I remember a Psychology 101 professor who told our class that teachers and cops tended to be personality types who either (a) genuinely care about people and want to help or (b) were sociopaths who want to wield power over others.

YTA in a major way!", "YTA. Someone as vindictive and petty as you shouldn't be in a classroom. Your authority as a teacher ends when it interferes with a student's bodily autonomy. You were actually willing to keep a kid from going to the bathroom merely to flex your authority. This is a blatant abuse of power. You should be embarrassed. You're the one who should be disciplined, not the student. No one should have to ask permission to take care of a basic bodily function. Everyone has to use the toilet and no one has the right to get in the way of that. Look for another job. You lack the maturity to be responsible for kids.", "As a girl I can\u2019t tell you how many times I ended up completely embarrassed, picked on and in tears with ruined jeans because some teacher told me I couldn\u2019t go to the bathroom when I felt the sudden need.

Flexing your \"authority\" over bathroom breaks is a really shitty thing to do. And does not speak well for your ability to manage and control a classroom.", "YTA. A teacher did that to a girl I went to school with and she pissed her pants in front of the whole class. You should be ashamed.", "Most parents I'd imagine would tell their kids to just go regardless. You're not gonna get many on your side here.

Going to the bathroom is a right not a privilege and you don\u2019t get to choose when people need to go to the bathroom or not, forcing some to hold it is inhumane.", "YTA. ..I honestly only read the title cause I don\u2019t really care what the reasoning is. Unless you have proof that he doesn\u2019t actually go to the restroom when he leaves then I see no reason to force someone to uncomfortably hold their bladder or bowels. I have to pee a LOT and it\u2019s impossible for me to focus on anything else when I need to go", "YTA and I think you kinda know it. You're going to deny a kid the right to go piss because what? You don't like him? \n\n> I called her and she asked was there a specific reason I wouldn\u2019t let him go. I responded no\n\nThat's fucked up and medical concern. You self proclaimed that you didn't like this kid. \n\n>There is one student in my class who I am not particularly fond of\n\nIf I were that student/parent I would report you to higher ups. It sounds like you became a teacher because you wanted authority and not because you care about kids. Maybe rethink your profession.", "YTA. \n\nDisobedient? You teach junior English. \nIf you are so concerned about controlling potty time..Maybe try a dog daycare instead?", "YTA \n\nLove that \"respect mah authority!\" bit you added at the end. Respect is something you earn, not something you enforce. Nobody respects a petty tyrant who uses their limited authority to pull meaningless power trips like this, you just look insecure.\n\nThere was absolutely no reason for you to say no other than flexing the small amount of power you have as a teacher. Literally no reason at all.", "YTA jfc what is wrong with you?", "YTA. Where I live and work it\u2019s illegal to not let a student go to the restroom. I absolutely understand that kids love to roam the halls during class but, so what? If they are disruptive wouldn\u2019t it be more beneficial if they left the class?", "YTA. Where is the lesson that he would take from this? Obey your teacher even if its mean wetting yourself? 30 mins is too long of a wait, heck there are people that cant retain more than 5 and your reasoning is just petty with no substance whatsoever. I could understand it if it was 1 min till the dismiss of the class, heck i could understand it if it was him being as petty as you, just to annoy you but no.", "YTA. You cannot force students, or anybody, to respect you. You tried to use your \u00abauthority\u00bb just because you wanted to. That is actually misusing your power. If you want your students respect you have to respect them. You showed lacking respect big time. (Sorry for bad English - not my language)", "YTA - Normally I would say, yes students should listen to the instructions of their teachers.  But, you don't indicate there was a pattern of abusing bathroom privileges from this student or give any reason for saying no.  In fact, you say there was no reason for denying the request.  Be honest, you did it just because you don't like this student.   That's not the behavior of a good teacher.", "YTA\n\nYou said no because you dislike the student, not out of some misguided desire that he respect your authority. Schools are not prisons where you raise your hand and ask to pee. \n\nEveryone is against you because you're an asshole.", "The stupidest thing to DATE was raising my hand in college to go to the restroom. 10 years later, and no one ever asks about restroom breaks. With love and light YTA - do better. That\u2019s just not how the real world works.", "YTA. Lol you tried to bully a kid because you thought you had a bit of power over him. You for some reason admit to not liking him and use this as the reason to deny him the ability to go to the bathroom. He called your bluff.", "YTA. Any reasonable person would have gone, and I hope you wouldn't let anyone treat you that way. You don't like this kid, who sounds like he might have ADHD and doesn't know how to sit down and shut up. But you don't mess with his bathroom needs. Not ever.", "When I was in 3rd grade, I watched as this girl Brenda begged the teacher to let her go to the bathroom and the teacher kept saying no. She was on her knees in front of the teachers desk, crying, but still no. I remember watching the puddle of urine form at her feet. I also remember the oversized pants she came back from the nurse's office in. \n\nI told my mom when I got home and she told me, in no uncertain terms, if I have to go to the bathroom and the teacher says no, I have her permission to ignore the teacher and leave to use the bathroom. \n\nMy mom is amazing. The kid in your story, his mom is amazing. You however are power tripping small children and it's making you a bad teacher. YTA", "YTA. You don't always get a ton of warning when you have to go to the bathroom. You're also TA for being vindictive, because I can only bet you would let any of the kids that \"you do like\" go without issues.", "YTA, absolutely. How do expect a student to concentrate if they have to go to the bathroom? Now if he asks all the time and takes his time, maybe I could see where you think he is taking advantage and just going off to miss class, but you did not say that, so I\u2019m assuming that is not the situation. He probably really had to go. Also, if it\u2019s like my daughters school they have about 3 minutes in between bells to get to the next class, not always enough time of your class is way on the other side of the school. You are just using your \u201cauthority\u201d to deny him for no good reason. No one should EVER be denied the use of the restroom. This makes me so angry. You are lucky I\u2019m not his mother, I\u2019d have given you a piece of my mind and called the principal.", "YTA. I promise no one respects your authority anymore after this dictatorial nonsense.

I know, I've had dozens of them. However, you're obviously applying your childish \"because I say so\" logic to how you teach him: you're not challenging or engaging him, *of course* he's bored.

There is one student in my class who I am not particularly fond of. He\u2019s very bright, he just talks a lot and gets distracted easily, and as a result, distracts his classmates. Earlier today, he asked me if he could use the restroom, and I told him no, and that he should have used it earlier. He looked at me confused and left anyways. I was in disbelief. When he came back, I asked him why had he left when I told him he couldn\u2019t. He asked me if I expected him to hold it for the rest of class time, which would have been around half an hour. He also informed me that he never thought asking for the rest room was for permissions sake anyways, as no teacher had ever told him no. I didn\u2019t really care for his excuses, so I told him he was being disobedient and would call his mother. He shrugged and said she\u2019d be on his side anyways. I called her and she asked was there a specific reason I wouldn\u2019t let him go. I responded no, and she said she would have walked out too, and to stop being so petty and controlling as to not let near adults use the restroom. This annoyed me, and I later asked my husband about it. He also asked my reason for not letting him go, and upon not providing one, also sided with the student. I\u2019m very confused by this; students should respect a teacher\u2019s authority. I\u2019m only posting here because everyone seems to be aiding against me.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Let\u2019s get a few things straight:\n\n1. In a child\u2019s potty training years, the number one thing we tell them is \u201clisten to your body. Go when you have to go.\u201d Then they get into US public schools (and I can tell that\u2019s what we\u2019re dealing with bc other countries don\u2019t have this power dynamic around restroom use with students,) and suddenly we flip the script. We treat children like inmates in a prison system, where they can\u2019t simply \u201cuse\u201d the restroom when they need to.\n\nThis leads me to \n2. There is no reason to engage in such a pointless power struggle with a child. You are a **teacher.** Use your common sense and recognize the difference between actual teacher authority and individual bodily autonomy. Going to the restroom when one needs to go is a perfect example of bodily autonomy. **Who are you to tell another human being when they can listen to their body and obey its functional demands?** And let\u2019s get something straight - excretion of waste is a literal **bodily function demand.** If a person doesn\u2019t excrete waste when they need to, horrific things can happen.\n\nWhich leads to \n3. Are you aware that holding one\u2019s bladder can lead to kidney stress, urinary tract infections, kidney failure, etc etc? Your bathroom restrictions out of an asinine and unhealthy desire to prove you hold the utmost power in the classroom are literally a lawsuit waiting to happen if a child gets sick, has an accident, or a parent deems that you\u2019ve caused psychological, physical, or emotional trauma. \n\n4. What **is** your plan for students who need to use the bathroom when you say no? I ask bc I **was** this student. I had a teacher who refused to let me go. I begged him. I was in 7th grade. I told him it was an emergency. He refused to go. I was terrified of getting punished for disobedience, so I didn\u2019t go. I literally **could not hold my urine,**  despite shifting my sitting position to one where I was digging my heel into my urethra. I pissed all over myself and my seat, and out of immense shame and humiliation, I said **nothing.** I used my uniform shorts and skirt to wipe up the mess as discreetly as possible and went into the bathroom and stuffed my underwear with toilet paper. That incident has haunted me for years. I feel rage whenever I think of that teacher and that incident. I felt so much shame for so long that I never said anything. I had to walk around wearing piss all day. I was a good, obedient, respectful student who got good grades. That teacher was on a power trip and he damaged me in ways he can never repair. I lost so much trust in teachers because of him.\n\nYou are a flagrant AH and quite frankly, this is child abuse. If this was my child, I would be demanding disciplinary action for you as a teacher, insisting my child be removed from your class, and consulting a lawyer about my options.

This does not apply to 99% of students.\n\nSurely, given your medical condition, you would have raised this with the school and got some sort of pass?", "Do you need to have a piss at the start of the lesson? Have a piss.\n\nDo you not need to have a piss at the start of the lesson? Wait until the end.\n\nThere is no way that your bladder can fill in an hour unless you have been drinking massive amounts of water. If you are daft enough to drink massive amounts of water before coming in to the lesson and then look surprised when that water moves to your bladder that's your own fault.", "Didn\u2019t mean to attack you at all.  Wanted to relay that your assessment is \ud83d\udcaf real and layered my hard ass judgement on top of it. \ud83d\ude0a", "I respected my teachers but not the ones that thought they could tell me not to go to the bathroom.", "absolutely this. i had a weak bladder in high school (i had a really bad bladder infection for a while) and absolutely needed to be able to use the bathroom whenever the urge to pee hit. \n\nwe had this one teacher in grade 9 who just *refused* to let kids go to the bathroom during his lessons, even if it was a double period, so i regularly had to just leave without permission or risk pissing my pants. \n\ni even came in with a note from my dad and then a note from my doctor, and he still didnt believe me, so i just resorted to threatening to piss directly on his desk if he didnt let me go because \u201cwell sir, either you let me go to the bathroom or i\u2019ll literally piss myself, and id rather make that a *you* problem than a me problem\u201d\n\nhe ended up getting fired because he refused to mark our work and had a mental breakdown over a mint being on the floor, but he was a very strange man", "A teacher at my school did it to a student this very day.

My mom raised hell. Teachers have always treated students like this.", "I\u2019m 6th grade I was getting used to a new medication that made me extremely nauseas daily. I would always throw up. One day I asked to be excused because I knew I was gonna puke. The teacher said no so I just let it happen. He then sent me to my moms room (she was also a teacher at the school) and said I could stay there so she sent me to the nurse and I went home. Some teachers are great some really really suck", "I also got in trouble for throwing up in class once. I had the flu (but didn\u2019t know it yet), got violently ill in class, then asked to go to the nurse\u2019s office so I could call my mom and go home. The teacher told me I had to clean it up before I left the room even though I felt like I was about to vomit again, so I just left.", "Yeah I got in trouble in fifth grade for having my period come in suddenly and needing to go to the nurse because I 'should have been tracking it by my age'", "A girl in my high school class got suspended for changing a tampon in class after being denied the bathroom.", "I will always remember the kid in my 5th grade who when told no, whipped it out and pissed on the floor. It was glorious.

At all. You went straight from one to the other. God forbid if you had to get from one end of the school to the other.\n\nTeenagers, weirdly, are human, and can't teleport.", "That\u2019s because teachers accept that things beyond their control are their fault. The correct behavior would be telling the student not to go if it\u2019s not an emergency, then radioing the admins if they do go and you\u2019re reasonably sure they\u2019re up to no good. Anything beyond that simply isn\u2019t your job and you should not be doing admin\u2019s jobs to cover for them.", "And how are you going to know who needs to go and who doesn't?  Or do you think only good kids ever need to pee?", "...you think you can get an IEP for your period?", "Yes. They also banned backpacks at the same time so imagine a bunch of dehydrated teens speed walking to class with literally all of their books in their arms at all times because they don\u2019t have time to go to their lockers. It only lasted about 3 months before they lighted up a little.", "Well, at least you admit you are also shit.", "I had a literal 504 plan for a disability that specifically said I could use the bathroom at any time. Many teachers still tried to tell me no. Also, not everyone is able to tell before the need becomes urgent\u2014for example, ADHD and autistic people tend to have poor interoception.

What then?", "100% not true. my bladder can sometimes hold pee for hours if I\u2019m busy. Other times I have to pee super bad after 15 minute of emptying my bladder. Case and point -chugged an energy drink and sipped on water at work and didn\u2019t have to pee for a good 4 hours until I forced myself to take a break. On the other hand me and my husband went to a movie and I had only had a 12oz drink in the morning cause we were moving things. Got to the movie and had to pee 3 times (all full bladder pees). Within that 2 hours of the movie (one of which was 10 minutes after I had just peed).", "Just because yours doesn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t mean that applies to everyone ever. Hyperactive bladder is a thing. An emergency is a thing. Teachers on power trips are also a thing.", "And what about people like me with kidney conditions etc? I have a partial blockage in one of my kidneys that whilst I've grown into it as an adult, I sure as hell hadn't as a kid. I would've been absolutely screwed with rules like this.\n\nAnd hell, what about temporary conditions like UTIs?

Going off about kids being problems if they needed the toilet regularly and making fun of them in front of the class. Real great.", "Heard a Reddit story on YouTube about a boy who was in second grade and after being denied  his request to go to the bathroom, stood and peed right in front of the teacher and because he was wearing basketball shorts it got all over the carpet. The kid\u2019s mothered was rightfully enraged and raised hell about it. The teacher got into trouble for denying the boy\u2019s plea to go to the bathroom.", "I had this happen to a friend In 2nd grade, that teacher was fired not long after for abuse and other issues.", "I also had this happen to me during computer lab back in 2001. I was also in first grade and it was so embarrassing.", "As a teacher, I would not want to have to deal with 'accidents' like this. I would always tell my students that if they have a real need to go, either to pee, poop or throw up, they can just rush out of the class and explain to me later. In all of my years of teaching (more than 20), I have never had anyone misusing this rule of mine.", "Similar to me, but higher grade", "Same, but my teacher was a nun and as far as I know there wasn\u2019t any hell raised. OP is YTA.", "Right i got first and last names of the various kids in various grades\n\n\n\nYes i said various its not confined to a specific grade or type of person\n\n\nJust based on the teacher", "I agree! As a teacher, that\u2019s what I always do. If there are students I simply don\u2019t trust because they do have those issues, I always call the office to have them escorted down, even if it sadly takes 20 minutes. But I do have friends in other districts who have gotten in a lot of trouble for stupid things such as letting kids go to the bathroom and the kids end up wondering the whole school. Unfortunately every school district is different and every Admin is different. I wish there was a better system in place.", "I never said that, but if you constantly use the bathroom in class or use the bathroom for long amounts of time don't get upset when they say no is my point.", "As a UK secondary (US high school equivalent) teacher you have my sympathy. That is the sort of rule introduced by fucking idiots.", "If you had a medical reason then denying you the use of a toilet is wrong.\n\nUsing autism and ADHD as an excuse is simply lazy - those people do not routinely piss themselves, ergo it is not much of an issue. I say this as someone further along the autistic spectrum than most people.\n\nSame question to everyone else - what would you do as the classroom teacher if everyone asked to go to the toilet at the same time? Would you let your whole class walk out?", "Ask to go to the toilet. If the teacher reasonably refuses, explain the situation.\n\nSame question to everyone else - what would you do as the classroom teacher if everyone asked to go to the toilet at the same time? Would you let your whole class walk out?", "oh my god that is unbelievably cruel", "That\u2019s horrible. Denying kids simple autonomy over basic bodily functions/needs is a simple control tactic meant to break kids. It\u2019s barbaric. I will NEVER allow my kids to be told they can\u2019t get water or use the bathroom. They can walk out and I\u2019ll handle it.", "So if a kid has diarrhea and therefore takes a long time to get back from the bathroom, the reasonable response is to make him stay in class and shit his pants? Sure, that sounds reasonable.", "Sure you did.\n\n\"ConsistentReward1348: No, you don\u2019t. Because you have no idea what someone\u2019s needs are. Bladder infection? UTI? kidney stones? **Period?**\"\n\nYou: \"that's why you get a 504 or IEP any accommodation\"", "Denying use of the toilet is wrong, period.\n\nAlso, I am also autistic. Just because YOU don\u2019t personally suffer from poor interoception doesn\u2019t mean others don\u2019t. Your experience of autism is not everyone else\u2019s. You don\u2019t have to \u201croutinely piss yourself\u201d to get a sudden urge to use the restroom, and there\u2019s no reason someone should be forced to wait and feel uncomfortable if they have to go.\n\nSeems like you might be a teacher and taking this personally. So I\u2019m assuming you could use your critical thinking skills here\u2014how likely would you say it is that every single person in your classroom has to use the restroom at once? You\u2019re using a VERY unlikely hypothetical situation to what-if your way into winning an argument, which honestly just boils down to you wanting authority and control to keep students from going to the bathroom.\n\nMeanwhile, disabled people are not unlikely\u2014we\u2019re everywhere. Seems much more reasonable and moral to just let the kids go pee when they need to, no matter if they have medical conditions!\n\nPS\u2014I did have a few teachers who let students use the bathroom freely, without asking, just got up and left. No one abused it. And if anyone ever did, I\u2019m sure there are ways to handle it that don\u2019t involve being petty and vindictive.", "I\u2019m sorry, to be clear, you are saying a teenage girl should have to tell her possibly male teacher about the state of her vaginal bleeding to get access to the bathroom? Fucking hell dude, get a grip.", "The state of my vagina is not my teacher's business.\n\nThey're teenagers, not idiots. Most bathrooms have 5, 6 stalls at most.

It won't only be me so that's an average of 5 students per class, 50 per year, 250 students wandering the school grounds.\n\nIf it's just 2 students per class, that's 20 per year, that's 100 students out of lessons.\n\nAlternatively I can tell students they are not using the toilet in my lesson and then, once the lesson has started, let out those who I genuinely feel need the toilet.", "Yes.\n\nIt's not difficult, something as simple as \"I'm on my period\" / \"That time of the month\" is more than enough.\n\nAre you a teacher? Have you dealt with the many, many excuses teenagers have to get out of lessons?#\n\nSame question to everyone else - what would you do as the classroom teacher if everyone asked to go to the toilet at the same time? Would you let your whole class walk out?", "As I said, explain the situation. It's not difficult. \"It's that time of the month\" will get most male teachers begging you to leave the room.\n\nSo you accept that 'needing the toilet' is not a valid excuse for everyone to walk out at once? Why is that a valid excuse for people to walk out one at a time then?", "You're not going to get an 504 or a IEP for a bladder infection either, my guy. Those can take AGES.", "This is so funny to me. Again with the critical thinking skills. You can\u2019t figure out any other solutions? A bathroom pass that the students take turns with? Do you not have hall monitors? This is seriously not difficult. Who you \u201cseriously feel need the toilet\u201d? Are you kidding me? Do you have xray vision that allows you to look into their bladders? I seriously hope you make a career change where you aren\u2019t responsible for the well-being of children.", "You say that, but there are really some grown men out there with jobs, wives, and kids,  that believe **people can just hold period blood like they hold pee**. When people gotta go, they gotta go.", "Nope. Not the teacher's business.\n\nIt's not about excuses. We'd have a conversation about the physical ability to all use the bathroom at once.\n\nAnd again, \"If my entire class needed to go to the bathroom at once, I'd be wondering if they all had food poisoning from lunch or something and be concerned.\"", "Yep, spot on. My 504 took ages to get and almost none of my teachers looked at it or respected it! People really don\u2019t get it lol.", "You complain that \"denying use of the toilet is wrong, period\"\n\nWhy do you have any other viewpoint? Anyone can be allowed to get up and leave, whenever they want, because they cannot be denied use of a toilet.\n\nIt's not complicated, I let out those students who I feel genuinely need the toilet. That is those who have asked me, waited a few minutes quietly and still want the toilet when I check with them 5 minutes later.\n\nThose who ask about going to the toilet, I tell to wait and have forgotten about it 20 minutes later I ignore.\n\nWell done on leaping to sarcasm rather than asking.", "Indeed. Those men are morons."]}
