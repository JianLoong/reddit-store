There is one student in my class who I am not particularly fond of. He\u2019s very bright, he just talks a lot and gets distracted easily, and as a result, distracts his classmates. Earlier today, he asked me if he could use the restroom, and I told him no, and that he should have used it earlier. He looked at me confused and left anyways. I was in disbelief. When he came back, I asked him why had he left when I told him he couldn\u2019t. He asked me if I expected him to hold it for the rest of class time, which would have been around half an hour. He also informed me that he never thought asking for the rest room was for permissions sake anyways, as no teacher had ever told him no. I didn\u2019t really care for his excuses, so I told him he was being disobedient and would call his mother. He shrugged and said she\u2019d be on his side anyways. I called her and she asked was there a specific reason I wouldn\u2019t let him go. I responded no, and she said she would have walked out too, and to stop being so petty and controlling as to not let near adults use the restroom. This annoyed me, and I later asked my husband about it. He also asked my reason for not letting him go, and upon not providing one, also sided with the student. I\u2019m very confused by this; students should respect a teacher\u2019s authority.

Look, I'm getting downvoted in another standing up for a teacher, but you've been asked 3 times why and if all you can bring is \"respect authority\" then YTA. Otherwise, this reads that you denied him just cause you don't like him. Whats the instructive/maturation reason for denial?", "So please tell us who the fuck you are to tell someone to control their bodily functions??? \n\nSounds like you just don't like the kid. \n\nYTA - no one likes teachers like you", "YTA.  He may have had a truly urgent need to use the bathroom at that moment.

They should have peed on the floor? Do you understand that bathrooms in schools can be crowded and sometimes you can't use it in the very short time between classes?", "YTA. You should not refuse a student's reasonable request to use the restroom. It reads as you really refused because you don't like the kid. If he had caused issues with restroom breaks before I might could understand, but this doesn't seem to be the case. \n\nKids are not dumb. This kid knows you don't like him and trying to demand respect is going to backfire. If he's as bright as you say, he's likely bored and should be moved to an advanced class.", "YTA.  Holding it in too long is known to have health problems, and it sounds like you're just on a pointless power trip that you need to work on if you're intending on staying in teaching", "YTA. Bodily functions are not optional. Power tripping is. Make a better choice next time. Something tells me you might not", "I remember a Psychology 101 professor who told our class that teachers and cops tended to be personality types who either (a) genuinely care about people and want to help or (b) were sociopaths who want to wield power over others.

YTA in a major way!", "YTA. Someone as vindictive and petty as you shouldn't be in a classroom. Your authority as a teacher ends when it interferes with a student's bodily autonomy. You were actually willing to keep a kid from going to the bathroom merely to flex your authority. This is a blatant abuse of power. You should be embarrassed. You're the one who should be disciplined, not the student. No one should have to ask permission to take care of a basic bodily function. Everyone has to use the toilet and no one has the right to get in the way of that. Look for another job. You lack the maturity to be responsible for kids.", "As a girl I can\u2019t tell you how many times I ended up completely embarrassed, picked on and in tears with ruined jeans because some teacher told me I couldn\u2019t go to the bathroom when I felt the sudden need.

Flexing your \"authority\" over bathroom breaks is a really shitty thing to do. And does not speak well for your ability to manage and control a classroom.", "YTA. A teacher did that to a girl I went to school with and she pissed her pants in front of the whole class. You should be ashamed.", "Most parents I'd imagine would tell their kids to just go regardless. You're not gonna get many on your side here.

Going to the bathroom is a right not a privilege and you don\u2019t get to choose when people need to go to the bathroom or not, forcing some to hold it is inhumane.", "YTA. ..I honestly only read the title cause I don\u2019t really care what the reasoning is. Unless you have proof that he doesn\u2019t actually go to the restroom when he leaves then I see no reason to force someone to uncomfortably hold their bladder or bowels. I have to pee a LOT and it\u2019s impossible for me to focus on anything else when I need to go", "YTA and I think you kinda know it. You're going to deny a kid the right to go piss because what? You don't like him? \n\n> I called her and she asked was there a specific reason I wouldn\u2019t let him go. I responded no\n\nThat's fucked up and medical concern. You self proclaimed that you didn't like this kid. \n\n>There is one student in my class who I am not particularly fond of\n\nIf I were that student/parent I would report you to higher ups. It sounds like you became a teacher because you wanted authority and not because you care about kids. Maybe rethink your profession.", "YTA. \n\nDisobedient? You teach junior English. \nIf you are so concerned about controlling potty time..Maybe try a dog daycare instead?", "YTA \n\nLove that \"respect mah authority!\" bit you added at the end. Respect is something you earn, not something you enforce. Nobody respects a petty tyrant who uses their limited authority to pull meaningless power trips like this, you just look insecure.\n\nThere was absolutely no reason for you to say no other than flexing the small amount of power you have as a teacher. Literally no reason at all.", "YTA jfc what is wrong with you?", "YTA. Where I live and work it\u2019s illegal to not let a student go to the restroom. I absolutely understand that kids love to roam the halls during class but, so what? If they are disruptive wouldn\u2019t it be more beneficial if they left the class?", "YTA. Where is the lesson that he would take from this? Obey your teacher even if its mean wetting yourself? 30 mins is too long of a wait, heck there are people that cant retain more than 5 and your reasoning is just petty with no substance whatsoever.

You cannot force students, or anybody, to respect you. You tried to use your \u00abauthority\u00bb just because you wanted to. That is actually misusing your power. If you want your students respect you have to respect them. You showed lacking respect big time. (Sorry for bad English - not my language)", "YTA - Normally I would say, yes students should listen to the instructions of their teachers.  But, you don't indicate there was a pattern of abusing bathroom privileges from this student or give any reason for saying no.  In fact, you say there was no reason for denying the request.  Be honest, you did it just because you don't like this student.   That's not the behavior of a good teacher.", "YTA\n\nYou said no because you dislike the student, not out of some misguided desire that he respect your authority. Schools are not prisons where you raise your hand and ask to pee. \n\nEveryone is against you because you're an asshole.", "The stupidest thing to DATE was raising my hand in college to go to the restroom. 10 years later, and no one ever asks about restroom breaks. With love and light YTA - do better. That\u2019s just not how the real world works.", "YTA. Lol you tried to bully a kid because you thought you had a bit of power over him. You for some reason admit to not liking him and use this as the reason to deny him the ability to go to the bathroom. He called your bluff.", "YTA. Any reasonable person would have gone, and I hope you wouldn't let anyone treat you that way. You don't like this kid, who sounds like he might have ADHD and doesn't know how to sit down and shut up. But you don't mess with his bathroom needs. Not ever.", "When I was in 3rd grade, I watched as this girl Brenda begged the teacher to let her go to the bathroom and the teacher kept saying no. She was on her knees in front of the teachers desk, crying, but still no. I remember watching the puddle of urine form at her feet. I also remember the oversized pants she came back from the nurse's office in. \n\nI told my mom when I got home and she told me, in no uncertain terms, if I have to go to the bathroom and the teacher says no, I have her permission to ignore the teacher and leave to use the bathroom. \n\nMy mom is amazing. The kid in your story, his mom is amazing. You however are power tripping small children and it's making you a bad teacher. YTA", "YTA. You don't always get a ton of warning when you have to go to the bathroom. You're also TA for being vindictive, because I can only bet you would let any of the kids that \"you do like\" go without issues.", "YTA, absolutely. How do expect a student to concentrate if they have to go to the bathroom? Now if he asks all the time and takes his time, maybe I could see where you think he is taking advantage and just going off to miss class, but you did not say that, so I\u2019m assuming that is not the situation. He probably really had to go. Also, if it\u2019s like my daughters school they have about 3 minutes in between bells to get to the next class, not always enough time of your class is way on the other side of the school. You are just using your \u201cauthority\u201d to deny him for no good reason. No one should EVER be denied the use of the restroom. This makes me so angry. You are lucky I\u2019m not his mother, I\u2019d have given you a piece of my mind and called the principal.", "YTA. I promise no one respects your authority anymore after this dictatorial nonsense.

I know, I've had dozens of them. However, you're obviously applying your childish \"because I say so\" logic to how you teach him: you're not challenging or engaging him, *of course* he's bored.

There is one student in my class who I am not particularly fond of. He\u2019s very bright, he just talks a lot and gets distracted easily, and as a result, distracts his classmates. Earlier today, he asked me if he could use the restroom, and I told him no, and that he should have used it earlier. He looked at me confused and left anyways. I was in disbelief. When he came back, I asked him why had he left when I told him he couldn\u2019t. He asked me if I expected him to hold it for the rest of class time, which would have been around half an hour. He also informed me that he never thought asking for the rest room was for permissions sake anyways, as no teacher had ever told him no. I didn\u2019t really care for his excuses, so I told him he was being disobedient and would call his mother. He shrugged and said she\u2019d be on his side anyways. I called her and she asked was there a specific reason I wouldn\u2019t let him go. I responded no, and she said she would have walked out too, and to stop being so petty and controlling as to not let near adults use the restroom. This annoyed me, and I later asked my husband about it. He also asked my reason for not letting him go, and upon not providing one, also sided with the student. I\u2019m very confused by this; students should respect a teacher\u2019s authority. I\u2019m only posting here because everyone seems to be aiding against me.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Let\u2019s get a few things straight:\n\n1. In a child\u2019s potty training years, the number one thing we tell them is \u201clisten to your body. Go when you have to go.\u201d Then they get into US public schools (and I can tell that\u2019s what we\u2019re dealing with bc other countries don\u2019t have this power dynamic around restroom use with students,) and suddenly we flip the script. We treat children like inmates in a prison system, where they can\u2019t simply \u201cuse\u201d the restroom when they need to.\n\nThis leads me to \n2. There is no reason to engage in such a pointless power struggle with a child. You are a **teacher.** Use your common sense and recognize the difference between actual teacher authority and individual bodily autonomy. Going to the restroom when one needs to go is a perfect example of bodily autonomy. **Who are you to tell another human being when they can listen to their body and obey its functional demands?** And let\u2019s get something straight - excretion of waste is a literal **bodily function demand.** If a person doesn\u2019t excrete waste when they need to, horrific things can happen.\n\nWhich leads to \n3. Are you aware that holding one\u2019s bladder can lead to kidney stress, urinary tract infections, kidney failure, etc etc? Your bathroom restrictions out of an asinine and unhealthy desire to prove you hold the utmost power in the classroom are literally a lawsuit waiting to happen if a child gets sick, has an accident, or a parent deems that you\u2019ve caused psychological, physical, or emotional trauma. \n\n4. What **is** your plan for students who need to use the bathroom when you say no? I ask bc I **was** this student. I had a teacher who refused to let me go. I begged him. I was in 7th grade. I told him it was an emergency. He refused to go. I was terrified of getting punished for disobedience, so I didn\u2019t go. I literally **could not hold my urine,**  despite shifting my sitting position to one where I was digging my heel into my urethra. I pissed all over myself and my seat, and out of immense shame and humiliation, I said **nothing.** I used my uniform shorts and skirt to wipe up the mess as discreetly as possible and went into the bathroom and stuffed my underwear with toilet paper. That incident has haunted me for years. I feel rage whenever I think of that teacher and that incident. I felt so much shame for so long that I never said anything. I had to walk around wearing piss all day. I was a good, obedient, respectful student who got good grades. That teacher was on a power trip and he damaged me in ways he can never repair. I lost so much trust in teachers because of him.\n\nYou are a flagrant AH and quite frankly, this is child abuse. If this was my child, I would be demanding disciplinary action for you as a teacher, insisting my child be removed from your class, and consulting a lawyer about my options.

Is going to the bathroom sometimes taken advantage of? Sure. Do you need to take care to rectify this BEFORE refusal? Yes. Yes you do. \n\nFor one, as girls are developing & needing to use the restroom during critical times of the month, sometimes the need is frequent, forgotten, unexpected. \n\nSecond, who the hell are you to decide if a kid has a stomach ache, or an illness that when they need to go, they need to GO. \n\nThird, have you ever been a 12, 14, 16 yr old kid & tried to take a crap with 750 (middle school size) or 4,000 (high school size) other kids around? Sometimes, going in the middle of class gives a little more privacy to those who are sensitive to that. (Me. I HATE even peeing & thinking someone is listening to me). \n\n\nFourth-passing periods are in theory meant to be able to access the bathroom. Sometimes-it is LITERALLY impossible to get from point A to point B & go to the bathroom in the allotted time. \n\nWhen teachers like YOU get on your high ass horse, I think YOU should have to ONLY use the bathroom the same as you expect the kids to. ONLY during passing periods. Not during your off hour. Not in the teachers lounge. March your happy butt into the bathroom w 30kids in & out, stand in line & get back to your classroom by the time the bell rings. \nThen think again if going during class is THAT big of a deal to you \n\nMy kids know that if they are EVER denied use or are told no, whether it's to them directly or to the class, they have every right to go & let me handle the consequences that follows.

Definitely bottom. \n\nGranted if it's young children that would make sense, but if you were in high school and were taking a piss when you came back the door would be locked, and a teacher would be wandering the halls and/or would check the bathroom.
