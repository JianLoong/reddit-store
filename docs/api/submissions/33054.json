It doesn\u2019t matter how many lines were open, you had a customer waiting. YTA and I\u2019d be grateful I still have a job.", "INFO how long was the conversation?", "YTA.  It's fine to chat with customers, but not when it holds up the line. Especially once he commented that it was bothering him, you should have just rang up the customer and stopped talking. Ringing up customers promptly isn't rushing them, it's doing your job.", "YTA. When you're at the register, you are the face of the company. And the face of the company can't turn to a customer and say \"I don't like you,\" no matter how rude they are.  You save that shit for the break room.\n\nPart of surviving retail is learning the balance between being friendly and chatty with the customer in front of you while still moving them along so you can help the next person.  You are there to ring people up and get them out the door, not to be their new best friend.", "YTA\n\nYour there to serve all the customers not just the ones that you feel are more worthy.

There is nothing wrong with getting chatty when things are slow, but the moment anyone is waiting on you is when you need to politely bow out and attend to them.", "So here's the thing.  YTA because I don't have time while you spend all day chatting people up.    Your job is to be friendly yes, but also to not hold up a line while you have a conversation.  There are very nice ways of rushing people out.  You start ringing up the people behind them when the initial chatty people are done.  You can even say, I have to ring them up because I will get in trouble otherwise.", "YTA. There was no need to tell the customer you don\u2019t like him. That was a stupid thing to do.

There's nothing wrong with being friendly, but you also need to be professional. The annoying guy is still a paying customer like the two veterans in front of him, and while he was rude, he did have a point. It's fine to talk to them while you're ringing them up, but NOT to stop and have a conversation. You don't have to be friendly with the people that are rude, but you still need to be just as polite with customer #3 as you were with customers #1 & 2, EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE THEM.

Yikes.  YTA, get a different job if you can't provide service to the customers you were hired to help.", "YTA. Retired vet here. First, what he said is 100% what I'd have said. Second, our veteran status doesn't entitle us to be dicks at the store, nor for people who work there to shirk their professional responsibilities because they feel like talking to us.\n\nYour manager let you off far too light. You should have been formally disciplined twice, once for socializing instead of doing your job, and once again for being rude to a customer who just wanted to go tf home. What if you were forced to wait unpaid a minute longer at work for every minute you held someone up like that? Pretty shitty right? Well, that's what you did to someone else, then you were a dick to them about it.\n\nVeteran worship always comes up when it's something you want - you wanted to talk to these people, so you point to their veteran status. Well let's reverse that. Let's say they're just two random people you're enjoying talking to, and the vet is the one with places to be who asks you to move it along. I can tell you from personal experience you'd invent some reason why it was ok to be rude to the vet this time. Leave us out of your crap.", "YTA.

With the old dude that probably only ever talks to you and with the other customer that is in such a rush he acts like a jerk, maybe he has a valid reason to be in a rush or maybe he is always like that, can you imagine to live a life like that?\n\nAnother way to rush it, if i understood correctly you said there were 3 clients? You ask the next client to start placing his things on the cash register belt.\n\nEven if the old man is telling you a more interesting story you can ask him to give you a min so you charge the other clients and he can finish the story.\n\nMany ways to move things along.\n\nRegarding the other guy when it is his turn, you just smile and you can even say sorry for the delay. And that's it. You don't say to a customer that is already angry \"I dont like you\", some people has killed for less. You don't expose yourself to such danger over something like a job. It is not only the image of the company you should worry about. It is your safety and your coworkers and even customers safety.\n\nAlso not everyone likes veterans. Some people actively dislikes them, like children of veterans that were abusive. And those guys were on their early 60s, some people havent even retired yet, don't act like they are such elderly delicate people.\n\nYou did wrong, that other dude was wrong too and the guy holding the line talking nonsense was wrong too.\n\nESH", "Then the other cashier is just as shit at their job as you are.", "If he commented on social hour, I am inclined to believe it wasn't just the transaction holding them up.\n\nAlso, if his assessment was wrong, then the better move on your part is to correct him (politely), not insult him.", "Yes you were supposed to tell them it\u2019s nice seeing you here/chatting /thanks for your service, I have another customer. \nIt is annoying to have to edit while servers make friends/small talk instead of ringing people up. \nSixties is not elderly. They got another twenty five years they don\u2019t need you hanging off them because they were in the military a long time ago.", "Oh. Sorry.", "On that, we agree. Everyone was wrong.", "No, the gentleman was telling me how he got 2 dollar bills from the bank. Which he was then paying with. I feel like I was in a lose/lose situation.", "I don't see how it was a lose-lose situation for you.\n\nYou complete their transaction, even if they need to finish their story. If you can't politely rush them, you can always politely apologize to the guy behind them for being stuck in that situation. And maybe even try to lighten the mood by noting how old people get or something.\n\nDozens of ways to placate everyone and you decided to insult someone. Reality check: most people are not very considerate--for you, it was the other guy but for him and some of us the vets dicking around are also inconsiderate. Most people are going to disappoint you if you give them enough time: you need to have a better strategy for dealing with that than antagonizing them.", "I'd also like to say, as a veteran, politeness isn't reserved for vets, and beta don't deserve extra politeness. We did a job, yes that job may have risks or lives more than others, but we were compensated (and probably are still being compensated) for that service. \n\nTreat everyone with respect, kindness, and dignity no matter their past.", "Also, the early 60s is not some ancient age they don't know where they are anymore. And I would imagine veterans understand context. Op is acting like he was handling people in the verge of death.", "Lol I just presumed he has a thing for military guys"]}
