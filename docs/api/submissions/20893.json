She's merely facing the consequences of being a raging asshole.", "Agreed. She needs a dog trained to stuff its paw in her mouth to shut her up.", "My wife has an \u201cinvisible\u201d disability and appears to all to be a normal functioning human being, but the amount of suffering and anguish she goes through is something few people will ever see.

I have a genetic joint problem and some deformities in my joints which causes balance and mobility issues. I'm clumsy as fuck and its getting worse the older I get. I also have a limp, but on my good days its generally not noticeable unless you watch me walk for a while. It gets worse quickly. I have a disability plate and use both a cane and a wheelchair on occasion, but there are times I'm out and about in public looking and walking pretty much normally.\n\nI'm getting a mobility dog after we move, for both support and balance, to help me pick things up if I drop them (I do so a lot, and it is painful and difficult most of the time to bend and pick them up again) and to help me if I take a fall and happen to be alone. \n\nI can't WAIT /s for all the ableist activists to start telling me I look fine and confronting my need for the dog.

Thank you both sincerely for serving.", "The issue with \"legal documentation\" is that there unfortunately isn't any. Any person can buy a certificate online and say it's a service animal.

There's no agency that actually verifies anything and it's illegal for places to ask for paperwork to allow a service animal in general.", "Did you, personally, somehow physically bar her from the flight, log into the airline's computers and revoke her boarding pass, or threaten that if she got on the plane, you'd hurt her?", "She was a disruptive ah who harassed you and repeatedly distracted crew members from their duties. That's aaaaaaalllllllll on her. The last thing a flight needs is a combative asshole throwing tantrums - there's no way to get space snd deescalate in a sealed metal tube full of stressed people. You did nothing wrong, and were way more obliging and accomodating than you needed to be.

You might've prevented her from harassing someone else who isn't able to speak out, in the future.\n\nHopefully from this incident, she learned a lesson about kindness and empathy.", "It's not that she was refused because you complained, it's that she was refused because the airline examined her behavior and determined they didn't want her on the flight. It wasn't your fault, if she'd been perfectly well behaved and you complained about her, nothing would have happened. If someone else had complained about her, she would still have been refused.

Theoretically, any person with a dog could get that paperwork as long as they fill in the right paperwork (pretty much someone attesting that the dog is healthy, well behaved, and that it is a service dog.) It's just to cover airline's and DOT's asses from everyone bringing their untrained/non working dogs on the planes. A lot of why this is is that some people will train their own service dogs, some people go with a private trainer, some people go through agencies. There's so many ways to get a service dog that it's really difficult to regulate them. It also lessens the very limited  accessibility of service dogs already to require government registration or an official license. It also really starts to creep on to infringing people's right to medical privacy if they're required to show paperwork like that. A lot of people will get \"proof\" or paperwork online stating that they have a real service dog, but if you just drop a little money anyone can get that too. This does tend to make some people argue less so it might be worth having, but it's nothing official from any governing body. \nIt sucks for a lot of reasons that there's no for sure registry of service animals, but it also can help make service dogs more attainable for lots of people.", "So sorry you had to experience this asshole op. Very clearly NTA. \n\nPlease don\u2019t waste your time interacting with people like this.

Service dogs don't require any certification papers. You were a lot more patient with her than i would've been.", "Wow. NTA. That lady was a huge asshole though. Sorry you went through that. I hope most people treat you and Charlee with the respect you deserve. I despise the way people seem to think its ok to go up to/annoy service dogs and their owners. I adore dogs. I love petting them.
