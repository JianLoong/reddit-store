Good for you for standing up for yourself and obviously the airline agreed with you", "Devildog, you're not required to request mast here. Just tell anyone who asks \"That is information I am not at liberty to discuss with you.\"  Because ultimately, the needs your dog serves is of a medical nature, it can be protected by federal ADA laws.

If you were the reason she was refused entry, good for you.  What an entitled pain!  You did not deserve any of that.", "10000% NTA. She dealt with the consequences of her own actions. You and Charlee did nothing wrong. Really sorry that this happened to you, SD handlers really just can\u2019t catch a break.", "NTA.\n\nThis person was determined to be entitled and unreasonable. There was no \u201cwin\u201d for anyone in engaging with her.", "NTA. This woman doesn\u2019t understand that some conditions are invisible. Did she want you to have horrific scarring to be valid? Did she think every service member has to be missing a leg?\n\nYour PTSD and injuries are valid, as is your service dog. You can only educate daft people so much. Their brain has to meet you halfway. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you dealt with this, and that your time in the service impacted you in this way. I hope your pup continues to help you and that others you meet will not be as condescending as this woman.", "NTA", "NTA, but why are you explaining your circumstances to randoms in a plane? Let the staff deal with that person and don't engage.", "NTA whatsoever. You have a legit service dog, for not just 1 but 2 valid reasons, and had legal documentation. You handled that 100x better than I would have.", "NTA.. you shouldn't have been harrassed like that. I would have love to sit next to you and the dog. I might have been tempted to ask about the dog but I take a hint quickly if its bothersome.", "NTA - people really need to learn that service animals are basically medical devices. What a terrible woman.", "obvious NTA.", "The fact you have any doubt because of that shows you are a compassionate person and definitely NTA.", "She did this herself and you should have asked since when she graduated as a doctor and when she consulted you to know your medical record.\n\nYou were extremely patient considering what a huge ah she was.

NTA don't you dare feel bad for a brat having to face the consequences of their own actions.", ">she would have had to make re-arrangements to he net destination.\n\nMaybe that gave her the chance to think about her behaviour. Probably not though. Glad the airline took steps against her.", "Well then she should have thought of that. Not your fault", "Exactly. She wasn\u2019t denied access to the next plane because of OP\u2019s complaint, she was denied because of her own outrageous behaviour. \n\nShe has no one to blame but herself. \n\nNTA, OP.", "NTA. You ended up next to a jerk. A lot of people don't understand service vs. support animals. You can tell a real service animal by its behavior and demeanor.\n\nIt is very unfortunate that there is no true register or standard for service animals. I think we all believe that someone who truly needs a service animal ensures that the animal has the ability to do what is needed. \n\nI wish that all service people could have a companion animal of their choosing to support them as they need.", "NTA.  Charlee is clearly a real SD, but there isn\u2019t actually any proof, if you are in the US.  If you have a card from the training organization, that isn\u2019t proof. Showing it to businesses just makes it harder for the next team.  Random people have no right to even ask. The airline makes you do their legal paperwork.  The woman had no business being TA to you and to the staff.  That was why they rejected her.  \n\nThe most you might be expected to say about him jumping on you is \u201cdogs are allowed to sit on your lap if they fit or are tasking, per FAA guidelines\u201d.  And if she continues, \u201cI have read the regulations from ACAA, you clearly have not.  Go read them before bothering me any more\u201d.  (Assuming you have, if you haven\u2019t, please do. It makes life with an SD a bit easier to know exactly how the rules are written.  Also the ADA FAQ. And you can call people liars, because you HAVE read the regs and they clealry havent and when you say that, you can say, \u201cyou are lying.  I know because I\u2019ve read the regs.  We both know you haven\u2019t\u201d.)", "NTA and this woman probably knows so much about those fake certificates you can buy online because she has one and it didn't work to get her dog on the plane so that's why she's pissed! Just speculating of course but it does fit lol", "NTA\n\nYou put your ass on the line and paid a heavy emotional, psychological, and physical toll through your Marine service. \n\nYou have a service animal that provided you the trained service you need and deserve on the flight. \n\nYou suffered abuse on your flight from an ignorant/entitled woman. T\n\nhe flight crew may not have had a good in-flight solution, but they provided an excellent solution during the layover. \n\nRest easy, you are not the AH.", "NTA and I'm sorry that happened to you. You have no obligation to provide \"proof\" of needing a service animal to strangers. She could have asked to be moved if it bothered her so much. Wow.", "NTA\n\nShe wouldn\u2019t have missed her next flight if she just minded her own business. As I get older I realize more and more than a lot of problems can be avoided if people follow this simple rule.", "NTA.

Anyway, I'm sorry you had to put up with that.", "NTA - I would have said some nasty stuff to that lady.  Good job keeping your cool in that situation.", "Nta", "NTA.  You should have told her to shut up and mind her own business much sooner.  You don't have to explain yourself or your dog, you don't have to show proof to anyone who isn't an employee of the airline!  Next time you run in to someone like her, ignore them or tell them to mind their own business.", "NTA. On your behalf, I'm saying this out loud for all to hear:\n\n*Ma'am. I suffered trauma to defend the Constitution that allows you to sit here and harass me for needing support to handle my trauma. When you (1) have proper documentation for a service dog, (2) earned it by putting your life on the line and suffering trauma, and (3) learned to give the appropriate space and respect for a service dog to do her job in peace... then - just maybe - you, too, can have your own service dog on a plane to keep you from being startled, having a panic attack, or a seizure. And maybe you, too, can spend your flight being harassed by an ungrateful, entitled citizen.*\n\nI hear the rest of the plane that you were on cheering for you right now.\n\nThank you for your service.", "Charlee obviously has a lot of tasks.\n\nNTA\n\nWhoo-doggy, the other passenger was her own tempest in a teapot though.", "NTA. Obviously. She is a terrible self centered centered garbage person", "NTA. She sucks as do all the people that travel with their fake support animals and I\u2019ll throw in a negative shout out to those the use handicap placards that belong to their relatives (and double to those that keep one from their deceased relatives)", "NTA, but there's no actual way to \"prove\" it's a service dog as there is now regulatory agency for service animals. All those cards and shit don't actually mean anything legally. But either way, you NEVER are required to explain why you need a service animal to anybody. Especially a B like that. NTA for any of this. Your dog and your disability is only your business.", "NTA. Most of us are willing to accept the very simple fact that actions have consequences. She decided to be an obnoxious jerk, so she gets to be treated like an obnoxious jerk. It is not your fault she was not allowed on the plane, try not to worry too much about it. Hope you and Charlee are well.", "NTA.  And good for the airlines for refusing her entry.  I'm sorry the flight attendants didn't step in and move her away from you before then.", "NTA\nYou don't need to explain yourself to people who are determined to misunderstand you", "NTA charlee sounds like a wonderful friend. the woman in the plane, less so. let's be fair, you could see an initial questioning but the fact she kept going and rubbish like 'you could have faked it\" -if she was making a fuss about her dog I'm guessing they were already watching her.", "NTA friendo. She's merely facing the consequences of being a raging asshole.", "Agreed. She needs a dog trained to stuff its paw in her mouth to shut her up.", "My wife has an \u201cinvisible\u201d disability and appears to all to be a normal functioning human being, but the amount of suffering and anguish she goes through is something few people will ever see.  She doesn\u2019t work and I do and I\u2019d never switch places with her if it meant I had to suffer the way she does.", "I'm concerned about this crap when I get my own service dog. I have a genetic joint problem and some deformities in my joints which causes balance and mobility issues. I'm clumsy as fuck and its getting worse the older I get. I also have a limp, but on my good days its generally not noticeable unless you watch me walk for a while. It gets worse quickly. I have a disability plate and use both a cane and a wheelchair on occasion, but there are times I'm out and about in public looking and walking pretty much normally.\n\nI'm getting a mobility dog after we move, for both support and balance, to help me pick things up if I drop them (I do so a lot, and it is painful and difficult most of the time to bend and pick them up again) and to help me if I take a fall and happen to be alone. \n\nI can't WAIT /s for all the ableist activists to start telling me I look fine and confronting my need for the dog. I already get it sometimes when I'm using the chair and stand up to walk for any reason, or when I park in the disabled slot and am not using my cane or what have you on that particular day.\n\nThis guy was so much nicer than I would have been.", "Well said. Thank you both sincerely for serving.", "The issue with \"legal documentation\" is that there unfortunately isn't any. Any person can buy a certificate online and say it's a service animal. Which super sucks for people like OP, who actually have one.", "There's no \"real\" certificate is the issue. There's no agency that actually verifies anything and it's illegal for places to ask for paperwork to allow a service animal in general.", "Did you, personally, somehow physically bar her from the flight, log into the airline's computers and revoke her boarding pass, or threaten that if she got on the plane, you'd hurt her?", "She was a disruptive ah who harassed you and repeatedly distracted crew members from their duties. That's aaaaaaalllllllll on her. The last thing a flight needs is a combative asshole throwing tantrums - there's no way to get space snd deescalate in a sealed metal tube full of stressed people. You did nothing wrong, and were way more obliging and accomodating than you needed to be. I'd suggest getting some over the ear headphones so if you have a similar issue in the future you can just pretend to \"not hear\" the bullshit instead of engaging.\n\nYou did nothing wrong, and that lady is lucky she's not on the permanent no fly list.", "Good. Hopefully she learns that actions have consequences. You did nothing wrong.", "Good, it\u2019s her own fault. NTA. It\u2019s a win-win, she got what she deserved due to her trash behavior & you got to have a nice, quiet flight without her harassing you.", "NTA. She FAFO.  Hopefully she'll keep her mouth shut in the future.", "DOT gives a license for the dog, normally is required to get on an airplane with a service animal. Does that not count?", "My boyfriend is a flight attendant and they give people a lot of chances to not get denied boarding. It's actually more paperwork and stress. so, if she was denied boarding, then she was a PITA and they were done with her. \n\nI bet other people complained about her too.", "It's good that you complained and that she wasn't allowed to fly! She was harassing you unfairly about personal information she had no right to know or question. If you didn't stand up for yourself that time she could have done it again, to someone that felt too uncomfortable to speak out, and been able to keep harassing people with her rude and ableist behaviour. You did a good thing.", "You shouldn't feel bad for advocating for yourself. You might've prevented her from harassing someone else who isn't able to speak out, in the future.\n\nHopefully from this incident, she learned a lesson about kindness and empathy.", "It's not that she was refused because you complained, it's that she was refused because the airline examined her behavior and determined they didn't want her on the flight. It wasn't your fault, if she'd been perfectly well behaved and you complained about her, nothing would have happened. If someone else had complained about her, she would still have been refused. It was her actions that had consequences, all you did was stick up for yourself. NTA at all", "She was making the flight unsafe", "Just complaining does nothing unless she is really bothering the staff, too.", "She must have REALLY pissed off the staff, or they wouldn\u2019t have done this.", "You probably weren't the only one to complain about her behavior.\n\nNTA"]}
