Idk how you could think you may be an AH for someone elses behavior.", "She was refused not because of you but for her improper behavior and harassments.", "She can blame you all she wants; it's still her fault. NTA.

It she was clearly the asshole and you are entitled to complain when people harass you for no reason.", "You probably were not only complainer since she was bothering everyone and not obeying personnel", "They wouldn\u2019t have done that if your complaint wasn\u2019t valid. Good for you for standing up for yourself and obviously the airline agreed with you", "Devildog, you're not required to request mast here.

You and Charlee did nothing wrong. Really sorry that this happened to you, SD handlers really just can\u2019t catch a break.", "NTA.\n\nThis person was determined to be entitled and unreasonable. There was no \u201cwin\u201d for anyone in engaging with her.", "NTA. This woman doesn\u2019t understand that some conditions are invisible. Did she want you to have horrific scarring to be valid? Did she think every service member has to be missing a leg?\n\nYour PTSD and injuries are valid, as is your service dog. You can only educate daft people so much. Their brain has to meet you halfway. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you dealt with this, and that your time in the service impacted you in this way. I hope your pup continues to help you and that others you meet will not be as condescending as this woman.", "NTA", "NTA, but why are you explaining your circumstances to randoms in a plane? Let the staff deal with that person and don't engage.", "NTA whatsoever. You have a legit service dog, for not just 1 but 2 valid reasons, and had legal documentation. You handled that 100x better than I would have.", "NTA.. you shouldn't have been harrassed like that. I would have love to sit next to you and the dog. I might have been tempted to ask about the dog but I take a hint quickly if its bothersome.", "NTA - people really need to learn that service animals are basically medical devices. What a terrible woman.", "obvious NTA.", "The fact you have any doubt because of that shows you are a compassionate person and definitely NTA.", "She did this herself and you should have asked since when she graduated as a doctor and when she consulted you to know your medical record.\n\nYou were extremely patient considering what a huge ah she was. NTA at all. Stop feeling guilty as there is no reason to feel it", "She was the asshole, not you or your dog. Forget about that insensitive woman and live your best life. Thank you for your service.", "She was refused because she was being a giant AH. NTA. People like this don't deserve an explanation from you. She doesn't own the airline.", "She did the fucking around, and found out. NTA at all bud.", "Oh dear, she had to face the consequences of her actions.  Anyway, hope aside from that the trip want well for you.", "Don't feel bad she needed a time out and that's what she got.\n\nPetulant children need correction from time to time. NTA don't you dare feel bad for a brat having to face the consequences of their own actions.", ">she would have had to make re-arrangements to he net destination.\n\nMaybe that gave her the chance to think about her behaviour. Probably not though. Glad the airline took steps against her.", "Well then she should have thought of that. Not your fault", "Exactly. She wasn\u2019t denied access to the next plane because of OP\u2019s complaint, she was denied because of her own outrageous behaviour. \n\nShe has no one to blame but herself. \n\nNTA, OP."]}
