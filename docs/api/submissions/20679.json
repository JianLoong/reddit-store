I had another person living with me but they moved out and the mother moved in. I don't mind living with her and her kid. It's fine and we kind of do our own thing.

I don't make lots of money either. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever I've noticed that my food would go missing or portions would be taken from it. I assumed it was her kid so I asked her if she'd stop him from eating my food. I was calm about it and she just said she would. It didn't really upset me when it first started. It started getting annoying when I'd get home from work and expect to have a meal's worth of leftovers in the fridge only to see it picked through or just gone. I kept bringing it up and she started getting annoyed with me bringing it up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust from observing them I realized that neither of them ever eat vegetables. And judging by the food that would get picked through and the food that would be untouched. Anything with green in it was avoided. Orange chicken would be gone but chicken and broccoli would be untouched. So I started putting vegetables in EVERYTHING. I find vegetables to be delicious. And anything green or not a potato does not get eaten. So I could mix some bell peppers into the food and it would be fine. I make a big portion of vegetables pretty frequently anyway so I just started putting it in everything I eat. If I had leftover mashed potatoes i'd pour green beans in and mix it up. If I had leftover cheesy/bacon fries I'd pour broccoli all over it and mix it in. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUsually my homemade stuff has vegetables in it but I started making sure everything did. I made a pot of mac n cheese(the kid's favorite thing) and poured in roasted brussel sprouts. Which is actually delicious to me and I'm eating more vegetables so it's a win win. She had been seeming annoyed but we were all home when I made the pot of mac n cheese. She was in the living room and saw me get out the brussel sprouts and was like \"what are you going to do with that?\" and I poured them in. She said I was being greedy and annoying. I just said \"I like brussel sprouts\" and that was it. She said \"we need food\" and I told her to go get some. Or stop buying only prepackaged things and your money will go further.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think she sees this as some big act of revenge but I just simply want to be able to eat my food. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1687819991, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14jw0zk/aita_for_putting_vegetables_in_all_my_food_so_my/", "score": 1270, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not your responsibility to feed her and her kid. She's the one who's greedy and annoying!!

They\u2019re taking advantage of you, you\u2019re feeding three people like this.", "NTA and I think it\u2019s a great way to fend off food thieves.

Is she receptive to help with learning how to make the food she\u2019s buying? Working with you to make extra portions of stuff they like? Teaching her kid to cook? Learning to like vegetables? I think, for your sanity and peace, making an effort to get to the bottom of the problem will help, or at least make splitting up the arrangement less stressful. I don\u2019t know if you want to make the effort, but if you do, stop short of cooking for them. Make sure you point out this is a take-away gift for the rest of their lives, if they know how to make their own food.
