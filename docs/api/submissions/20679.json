I had another person living with me but they moved out and the mother moved in. I don't mind living with her and her kid. It's fine and we kind of do our own thing. I spend a lot of time at my boyfriend's place or working. Our work schedules collide so we really don't interact much but when we do it's fine. No issue there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to start with saying that she clearly struggles financially but I don't think it's an excuse. I don't make lots of money either. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever I've noticed that my food would go missing or portions would be taken from it. I assumed it was her kid so I asked her if she'd stop him from eating my food. I was calm about it and she just said she would. It didn't really upset me when it first started. It started getting annoying when I'd get home from work and expect to have a meal's worth of leftovers in the fridge only to see it picked through or just gone. I kept bringing it up and she started getting annoyed with me bringing it up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust from observing them I realized that neither of them ever eat vegetables. And judging by the food that would get picked through and the food that would be untouched. Anything with green in it was avoided. Orange chicken would be gone but chicken and broccoli would be untouched. So I started putting vegetables in EVERYTHING. I find vegetables to be delicious. And anything green or not a potato does not get eaten. So I could mix some bell peppers into the food and it would be fine. I make a big portion of vegetables pretty frequently anyway so I just started putting it in everything I eat. If I had leftover mashed potatoes i'd pour green beans in and mix it up. If I had leftover cheesy/bacon fries I'd pour broccoli all over it and mix it in. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUsually my homemade stuff has vegetables in it but I started making sure everything did. I made a pot of mac n cheese(the kid's favorite thing) and poured in roasted brussel sprouts. Which is actually delicious to me and I'm eating more vegetables so it's a win win. She had been seeming annoyed but we were all home when I made the pot of mac n cheese. She was in the living room and saw me get out the brussel sprouts and was like \"what are you going to do with that?\" and I poured them in. She said I was being greedy and annoying. I just said \"I like brussel sprouts\" and that was it. She said \"we need food\" and I told her to go get some. Or stop buying only prepackaged things and your money will go further.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think she sees this as some big act of revenge but I just simply want to be able to eat my food. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1687819991, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14jw0zk/aita_for_putting_vegetables_in_all_my_food_so_my/", "score": 99, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your choice.  You\u2019re not ruining your food and making it inedible out of spite - you\u2019re adding ingredients you like to ensure it doesn\u2019t get eaten by people who didn\u2019t contribute to the cost.\n\nYou are not responsible for feeding your roommate and her child. Hardship or no, that\u2019s her responsibility.", "NTA! Ingenious idea. Can you get a fridge safe? Or a lockable mini fridge for your bedroom? \nKeep adding them greens. Sugar snaps are also yum with mash.", "NTA\n\nCook your food how you like. If it discourages food thieves, even better.", "That was a brilliant solution. And obviously she was stealing and totally acting like she was entitled to your stuff. NTA\n\nETA: You should tell her she's welcome to have some (after you doctor it with veggies). How can you be greedy if you're offering? LOL", "NTA.  Sounds like a good solution.  And eating more vegetables is always good for you.", "NTA... I had a roommate that would eat a lot of my food. So I started to either add hot sauce or certain veg to my food so she wouldn't eat it all. It's frustrating to come home and think you have dinner already made only to discover that it has all been eaten.", "NTA. An act of revenge?? Your roommate sounds entitled and delusional. It's not your responsibility to feed her and her kid. She's the one who's greedy and annoying!! She sucks.\n\nYou shouldn't have to do that to your food so your mooch roommate and her kid don't scarf it down. They need to buy their own damn food. I'd be mad as hell.", "NTA, how are you responsible for her not getting food for herself and her child? They\u2019re taking advantage of you, you\u2019re feeding three people like this.", "NTA and I think it\u2019s a great way to fend off food thieves. Nobody should be taking your food without your permission. If they asked you to share in return for, say, doing extra chores around the house, that would be fine. But just taking it is wrong, and you\u2019ve got a good response to it.", "\"I don't understand why you are complaining... You already agreed to not let him eat my food, so why does it matter to you how I make it?\"\n\nNTA. You also would not be an AH if you locked up your food or if you started charging her if either of them eat any more food without permission", "NTA\n\nYou did what you had to do to be able to eat your own food. \n\nIs she getting WIC?", "NTA-I would\u2019ve had more respect if the mom would have been honest about not having food from the beginning (makes me wonder if it wasn\u2019t just the kid or if she was aware of his behavior the entire time). Also sad that after you confronted her, the behavior didn\u2019t change. On a side note I also love Brussels sprouts and might have to try adding them to Mac and cheese lol.\n\nEdit-Also honestly it would benefit them if they would get more veggies in their diet anyways lol.", "NTA at all. It's a non-confrontational way to deal with the situation.", "NTA, it is your food. Perhaps a bit passive aggressive, but you did address the problem with her before bringing in the veggies, and I\u2019m not one to judge for being passive aggressive since I do it too. \n\nIt may be unwarranted, but you may want to keep watch on your rm\u2019s finances (or as much as you can without crossing the line). If she has trouble with her food budget it could easily escalate to rent.", "NTA but maybe give her some brochures on where there are food banks and churches if she's that hard up on food.", "NTA, this is quite a non-confrontational solution.\n\nSeems fit for r/pettyrevenge or a similar sub.", "NTA", "NTA. It's not your responsibility to feed them. \n\nThere's so much I want to say about how she's actively harming her kid but I'd probably be banned.", "NTA.  She needs to look into food pantries and food stamps.", "NTA. You don't have any agreement to share food, it's your food and you can do what you like", "NTA. I can sympathize with her struggling,  but that doesn't entitle her up take your food. It would have been different if she had told you she was a little short on food that week and asked for something for her kid,  but taking and denying don't cut it. If you want to be charitable,  you could look up info on food banks near you and leave out for her,  but it'll be on her to get it.\n  \nAlso, diced jalape\u00f1os or broccoli are great mixed in with Mac and cheese", "NTA", "NTA. You are not responsible for them.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t think the kid is either, who wants to live with a hungry child? Mom just needed to be upfront, or at least honest, and she wasn\u2019t so that makes her the AH.\n\nThat being said, it sounds like they are struggling, and you have the ability to if not alleviate the problem, point out that you are willing to help, but on your terms.\n\nDoes she know how to cook at all? Is she receptive to help with learning how to make the food she\u2019s buying? Working with you to make extra portions of stuff they like? Teaching her kid to cook? Learning to like vegetables? I think, for your sanity and peace, making an effort to get to the bottom of the problem will help, or at least make splitting up the arrangement less stressful. I don\u2019t know if you want to make the effort, but if you do, stop short of cooking for them. Make sure you point out this is a take-away gift for the rest of their lives, if they know how to make their own food.  If they do, great, you\u2019ll have a prep cook or two, if not you can happily eat your Brussels sprouts Mac and cheese with no guilt.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
