I had another person living with me but they moved out and the mother moved in. I don't mind living with her and her kid. It's fine and we kind of do our own thing.

I don't make lots of money either. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever I've noticed that my food would go missing or portions would be taken from it. I assumed it was her kid so I asked her if she'd stop him from eating my food. I was calm about it and she just said she would. It didn't really upset me when it first started. It started getting annoying when I'd get home from work and expect to have a meal's worth of leftovers in the fridge only to see it picked through or just gone. I kept bringing it up and she started getting annoyed with me bringing it up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust from observing them I realized that neither of them ever eat vegetables. And judging by the food that would get picked through and the food that would be untouched. Anything with green in it was avoided. Orange chicken would be gone but chicken and broccoli would be untouched. So I started putting vegetables in EVERYTHING. I find vegetables to be delicious. And anything green or not a potato does not get eaten. So I could mix some bell peppers into the food and it would be fine. I make a big portion of vegetables pretty frequently anyway so I just started putting it in everything I eat. If I had leftover mashed potatoes i'd pour green beans in and mix it up. If I had leftover cheesy/bacon fries I'd pour broccoli all over it and mix it in. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUsually my homemade stuff has vegetables in it but I started making sure everything did. I made a pot of mac n cheese(the kid's favorite thing) and poured in roasted brussel sprouts. Which is actually delicious to me and I'm eating more vegetables so it's a win win. She had been seeming annoyed but we were all home when I made the pot of mac n cheese. She was in the living room and saw me get out the brussel sprouts and was like \"what are you going to do with that?\" and I poured them in. She said I was being greedy and annoying. I just said \"I like brussel sprouts\" and that was it. She said \"we need food\" and I told her to go get some. Or stop buying only prepackaged things and your money will go further.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think she sees this as some big act of revenge but I just simply want to be able to eat my food. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1687819991, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14jw0zk/aita_for_putting_vegetables_in_all_my_food_so_my/", "score": 7589, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not your responsibility to feed her and her kid. She's the one who's greedy and annoying!!

They\u2019re taking advantage of you, you\u2019re feeding three people like this.", "NTA and I think it\u2019s a great way to fend off food thieves.

Is she receptive to help with learning how to make the food she\u2019s buying? Working with you to make extra portions of stuff they like? Teaching her kid to cook? Learning to like vegetables? I think, for your sanity and peace, making an effort to get to the bottom of the problem will help, or at least make splitting up the arrangement less stressful. I don\u2019t know if you want to make the effort, but if you do, stop short of cooking for them. Make sure you point out this is a take-away gift for the rest of their lives, if they know how to make their own food.

Obviously she has never seen my channel so today we\u2019re picking this open with a banana because I want a challenge.", "I truly don\u2019t understand how people can be so entitled. Seriously. What on earth is happening in their head?", "Tbh I always thought I was immature or something that I struggled to drink water, tried for years to like it. It always tasted bad and I struggled. Then I realized that 25ml of Lemon or lime juice to 1 liter of water made it taste like like other people say water tastes.\n\nI think some of us are just overly sensitive to something in our local water supply or maybe sensitive to the pH/slight alkalinity", "I feel the same way about grown people who dont eat vegetables.", "N T A.  My friend who recently passed away from a drugs overdose would continual ask me for money for \"food\".  When I said I'd happily meet her in Tesco to buy a weeks worth of grocery \ud83d\udecd,  she would come up with excuses that she wanted KFC etc .  I offered to deliveroo them to her, but it became obvious that she wanted the money for drugs.   The guilt I felt when she was found in a filthy flat, having been dead for nearly a week still haunts me.  \n\nHer family also blamed me in part for her death,  but drug addicts are so convincing in their attempts to get money out of you \ud83e\udd75", "How do you react to wasabi or horseradish? That's a different chemical again.\n\nEdit\" Oh, I saw your other comment. Nice that wasabi still works as intended!", "Or go to a food bank.", "Depends on how rich you are. I\u2019d help as a group. Or direct them to a food bank.Not alone, I\u2019m a student so hell no.", "My daughter is diagnosed autistic and only drinks water and teas. She doesn\u2019t like fruit juice as it\u2019s too strong and absolutely hates anything fizzy. So it\u2019s water for cold drinks and tea for hot and that\u2019s it. Luckily she eats a variety of things without any real sensory issue.", "Apparently a lot of places will cheap out on the wasabi and just use horseradish that's dyed green, so it makes total sense you would sometimes get wasabi that's spicy (*actual* wasabi) and sometimes end up with bland green horseradish.", "You should totally record yourself doing the one chip challenge, it would be so funny seeing someone eat them like regular chips with no reaction to the spice", "lol same, I\u2019m pregnant so now Im probably gonna be craving Mac and cheese lol", "If you season the ground beef well, and add some cheese to the soup, it can be really good.  That is how we made marzetti growing up (sans cheese) my sister added that to the recipe after she moved out and it was a vast improvement.", "Most restaurants do. Real wasabi is like 50 bucks for a root or something.", "Not just bagels, it gives pizzas a crisp crust and a chewy interior - even a takeaway pizza I had was gorgeous, and it was the first (and only) times my husband willingly ate bagels because they were so good"]}
