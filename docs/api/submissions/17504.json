Because they\u2019re in a destination people visit often. The last time we visited was 4 years ago, just before Covid.\n\nThey were all excited for us to come but actually being there was kind of awful. They have very odd, strict rules, and we had to walk on eggshells around them. Put something back in the fridge? Oh no, that\u2019s not the spot we put it in. Washing the dishes? We like to keep the water on this temperature. Basically everything we did was micromanaged, from what time we woke up, how we made breakfast (we were expected to buy all the food and cook but oh no! The toast wasn\u2019t toasted quite enough- you guys actually like it like that??), how long we showered (under 6 minutes only), and so on.\n\nWe also weren\u2019t able to do anything separate from them. They chose what we did during the day, what movies we watched at night, etc. We didn\u2019t get to go out to eat and barely got to go to the beach. We mainly sat in their house, made small talk, and watched movies.\n\nLastly, we had to thank them over and over for what they DID provide us. They would prod us if we didn\u2019t: \u201cwow, wasn\u2019t that so nice of mom? She deserves a big thank you for that.\u201d And about kind of random things, like showing us a movie we hadn\u2019t seen, or getting someone a wine glass.\n\nIt was just a super weird trip. I don\u2019t think they meant to be bad, but it was honestly a terrible time and is not something I want to repeat (and definitely not for multiple weeks!). They\u2019re really pushing us to come and have been for the last year. My husband wants me to go this fall to keep the peace. AITA if I refuse? He is welcome to go alone, but he says that his mom will start to get upset (and he was already getting upset in the convo).", "created_utc": 1684356821, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13kdrif/aita_if_i_refuse_to_visit_my_mils_house_after/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your husband obviously knows that his parents are dreadful hosts, and asking you to submit to that torture just to keep the peace is a terrible precedent to set in a relationship.  Don't do it. \n\nFirmly but kindly send him off - ALONE - to deal with his mum and dad until he grows a spine and can promise a more reasonable outcome.

That way he can spend alllllll day and evening sitting around their house and you can go beach bum it. At least part of the time, you'll probably need to spend at least one evening with them.", "NTA, that sounds awful. \n\nI\u2019d still offer to visit your MIL for a meal or coffee or something brief since she\u2019s your husband\u2019s mother (if your husband still wants to stay for an extend period with his mother, that\u2019s his prerogative).

That\u2019s a nope.", "NTA.  I wouldn't want to go either. Obviously, your husband's used to his mother's very controlling, oppressive behavior and has learned not to rock the boat by doing exactly what she wants.  But that's not healthy and he can't expect you to do the same.   They timed your showers, wouldn't let you go out, or leave you alone, and made you buy and cook all the meals for everyone?!! WTF? No.  \n\nWhy don't you invite them to your home first for a visit and show them what normal hospitality is like?  Then when they insist that you visit them, have your husband ask them if they enjoyed staying with you and why? This would be an opportunity to have an honest adult conversation with his mother about her behavior. If they can't treat you like you treat them in your home, then it's best to stay at a hotel or rent a place when you visit so you can control the weirdness or at least have a refuge from it.", "Nta.

Most of them try to arrange visits so that the other partner doesn't (or physically can't) go. And this works out well. However it took a while for these friends to be able to work these arrangements out.\n\nYou need to explain that you will find the experience stressful and need a holiday to recover from the holiday. He can't understand this because he is used to the vibe and probably has ways of navigating through it. It is fine to ask if he can visit at a time when you have something else on.  Its perfectly fine to say something like: \"my wife is doing this massive project and basically be working late nights. Maybe I could come stay with you for the week? She gets a distraction free environment and I get a holiday?\" (or whatever event might be happening).", "NTA these people sound weird as hell. My in laws are pretty crazy, and I still go because it means a lot to my husband, but he is willing to work with me so it isn\u2019t terrible. If you go keep it short (four days max), rent a car, stay in a hotel, take breaks and schedule time to just hang out with your husband, and have a code word for when you need to leave and go back to the hotel.

Tell him he can stay at his parents and you stay at a hotel.

I enjoy having them in my home because were able to set some of the boundaries. But now they have visited us 3+ times and are looking for a visit back.\n\nI think the problem is that MIL feels indebted to her partner (they have separate accounts but he covers everything) so she wants everything to be perfect for him.

It's fine if he wants to go visit on his own, but you want to actually relax. Hill to die on, because if he's going to keep expecting you to indulge this nonsense, I foresee I need for massive therapy after every trip.
