I told him it was awkward, as I didn't like sports but I didn't want to be banished to the kitchen with \"the women\".

When you try to uncover who they really are, you may be disappointed because what you might find that their real selves have been subsumed.

Leave your judgement at the door and be as pleasant as is possible. \n\nFor years, my Thanksgiving tradition was to throw an informal rather raucous party. My brothers and I did most of the cooking while guests brought desserts and sides. Football might have been on the TV, music was playing, and we would often do goofy childish arts and crafts. These parties were always well attended and a lot of fun. I was with my ex for many many years. This meant that half the time, I was with her family which was just she, her brother, her mom, and her aunt. All of these people were unsociable, boring, quiet, and awkward.

However I do have to say that it was my favorite part of the holidays growing up. The men would be sitting in the living room watching football and the women were technically in the kitchen cooking, but mostly they were in the kitchen drinking and playing poker and the older aunts were telling bawdy stories with a glass of sherry in their hands. We also mostly kept the snacks in the kitchen, so the men didn't get much of that. That was mostly ours.

I am extremely feminist but this \"I refused to be exiled to the kitchen so I tried to interrupt their football viewing with my own conversation\" business is obnoxious for an outsider. No one kicked her out of the tv area because she had to serve them. No one told her to be their beer wench. There was no intricate dance of plate fixing for the menfolk while also not obstructing the view of the tv. No rush to get food out to coincide with halftime.", "Three ducks on the wall and a framed Jersey?", "\u2018The family tradition is for the guys to watch football and the ladies hang out in the kitchen and make the meal.\u2019", "Did he warn you about the dynamic? Or was it a surprise?", "Could be the kids that wanted to watch football, were watching my football, and the kids who didn't want to were watching... *Christmas movies*, that happened to be going on in the kitchen.", "Also, OP doesn't specify what \"watching the kids\" entails the ages of the kids.", "Honestly, it sounds more like she expected to be her bfs center of attention at a family gathering.", "In my family it's usually just volunteers later in the evening. Usually more men than women.", "Nah, in the 70s it was those paintings of squash lol.", "\"There were about 15 women in the kitchen, so not all were helping when I was in there, though I did hear orders being given from the livingroom multiple times, so I am not sure who was doing what.\" From what OP has said she was never expected to help out. You think 15 females can fit in a kitchen? I have an averagely sized one and even when my husband and I cook together we still fight for space", "But nobody made her not watch the game or forced her to help in the kitchen. Is it sexist? Yes, but I get the feeling that if she had been interested in the game, the men would have welcomed her.", "and of course her BF could have been more diplomatic ie introduced her to all the guys watching football (they'd probably grunt but at least he'd of done his part), gotten her a drink and went with her to say hi to all his women relatives and introduce her THEN go become a couch potato with the dudes. One gets to talk to their partners all the time - personally I don't need my husband attached at my hip & vice versa. This would have been a chance to mingle and form relationships with the women relatives - get a feel for the family dynamics etc.  find out if she likes everybody or not, It sounds like Mom is very welcoming so if she was seriously thinking about this guy as 'forever' now was her chance to see what her potential MIL was like away from the BF.", "Oh, well, she\u2019s a guest, so she\u2019s allowed to sit, same as bf. And she\u2019s allowed not to be thrilled about the expectations placed on her."]}
