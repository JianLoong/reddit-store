When you try to uncover who they really are, you may be disappointed because what you might find that their real selves have been subsumed.

Leave your judgement at the door and be as pleasant as is possible. \n\nFor years, my Thanksgiving tradition was to throw an informal rather raucous party. My brothers and I did most of the cooking while guests brought desserts and sides. Football might have been on the TV, music was playing, and we would often do goofy childish arts and crafts. These parties were always well attended and a lot of fun. I was with my ex for many many years. This meant that half the time, I was with her family which was just she, her brother, her mom, and her aunt. All of these people were unsociable, boring, quiet, and awkward.

However I do have to say that it was my favorite part of the holidays growing up. The men would be sitting in the living room watching football and the women were technically in the kitchen cooking, but mostly they were in the kitchen drinking and playing poker and the older aunts were telling bawdy stories with a glass of sherry in their hands. We also mostly kept the snacks in the kitchen, so the men didn't get much of that. That was mostly ours.

All the guys (but the host) cleaned everything. Host got to sit on his butt which is all he wanted lmao. It worked great cause we couldn't have trusted those early 20s boys to cook a feast, but damn it they can wash a dish!

That\u2019s not misogyny, that\u2019s just women making the decision to enjoy themselves away from their husbands for a while with like company. \n\nPlus, the men didn\u2019t kick her out of the living room- if the men had a sign in the living room that said \u201cno girlz allowed\u201d or something, then sure I\u2019d go with you there on the misogyny bit.

Yes, most of the women cook and most of the men do chores in the older generation, but in the younger one, it's a lot more evenly split (and if you're not cooking, you're responsible for watching kids, which means the men usually do the majority of the childcare on Thanksgiving.)  \n\nThe main point is everyone is contributing.

She wasn't told she was unwelcome watching football or anything.", "ha I'm Italian and my family always does this and I (male, oldest) always stay in the kitchen and drink with the women actually making the food. Get all the gossip and everything, it's way more entertaining than any sports.", "Where does it say OP was ever expected to serve anybody?", "Do you think if the women decided to also watch football that anyone would cook the meal?", "You don't have to participate, but you dont get to dictate what everyone else does either. You didn't want to hang out in the kitchen, you didn't want to watch sports, so I'm confused as to what would have made you happy? Everyone else was fine with what they were doing but it sounds like you wanted them all to stop to...entertain you? It sounds like you were more than welcome to join either group.", "Right but that's irrelevant, the point is here that there were people who were trying to engage with you, and you just immediately like ditched them to go sit next to your boyfriend and the men and trying to force them to engage with you, when that's not what they wanted to do. Why was being around the other women so awful?", "My family has never had a formal Thanksgiving to sit down, too big for it. We do a misshapen circle for \"prayers\" and then we find an available space to sit and eat. Usually clustered into the same groups you were in before.", "Lol, \"banished to the shiny distraction box\".", "That a good point, it's like how some people view a 'mancave' as \"oh my husband gets a room all to himself because he's the man of the house\" instead of \"I put all of his dumb shit in this room so I don't have to see it\".", "Who says the women want them to sit down for a family meal with them? Don\u2019t assume that what you might want is what they wanted. It sounds like there were 15 adult women; I\u2019m not going to assume that none of them are able to speak up if it bothered them. \n\nYou\u2019re also assuming that the women cooking and eating together isn\u2019t valuable or important to them. They may enjoy spending that time together with, just us girls, as much as the men enjoyed spending their time together.", "[deleted]", "Funny. This is how YOUR family does it. So.your family is the only right way? \n\nIn my family no one is in charge of the kids other than the parents. The kids are free to roam.so one minute the people in the kitchen are watching, next the people out back are watching. This is hoe MY family does it. It's not.the only right way. \n\nAlso,  most young kids find the chatter, cookies, and Christmas movies more interesting than the quiet football game. So you know, they gravitated towards the more fun area too.", "Half of his family! The icing on the cake here is that the men loaded up their plates then went back to watch television.", "Don\u2019t forget the macrame plant hangers and sand candles!", "Oh for sure!  I learned all my best shit talk that way too.", "See, this is exactly why I don't think they're being sexist. My family is like this too (Also Italian). And while the men do tend to go to the living room and the women stay in the kitchen, no one bats an eye if a woman ventures into the living room or a man joins us in the kitchen. And we were never told where we had to go growing up. My sister and one aunt rarely leave the living room. And I have a few guy friends who prefer to stay in the kitchen. I don't care what sex in the room watching TV or what they're watching. It's annoying when you're trying to pay attention and someone keeps trying to talk to you.", "If she's expected to help \"the womenfolk\" make the food, she's expected to help serve the men who can't get off their asses to help.", "No way to answer that question.", "It sounds like she was trying to converse with the people that were near her boyfriend. Literally nothing wrong with it. I have social anxiety, especially with people my partner knows, and I do the same. I\u2019m not going to wander off by myself to chat with complete strangers. Even if I do, barely, know a few of the people in the other group.", "> Not arguing about the sexist part but it sounds like you think meeting the MEN is more important the women.\n\nYeah, I got that vibe too.  Especially with complaining that the men weren't chatty and so she wasn't able to get to know his family.  But the women greeted her warmly and invited her to join their activity!  But I guess only the menfolk count as 'family' in OP's book.", "I'll argue about the sexist part.... It's very possible that's what these women like to do. I (a man) love spending hours cooking in the kitchen. It doesn't seem like they weren't allowed to watch football, just that they would prefer to spend the time in there", "That's what's bothering me. Because it does feel like she's saying that because everything didn't switch up as soon as she arrived there's a problem. Like people are allowed to do their own thing and she's the outsider walking in who needs to figure out where she fits in with the vibe", "Yea, our Thanksgivings were pretty large. Either a long table inside, or multiple tables outside, depending on how many showed up that year. But at some point, everyone is sitting, eating, and socializing with \"their group.\"", "Well that is what it does. Plop a child or man in front of it. Boom a half hour or more of them being to distracted to get in the way or but into things.", "That part really bothered me - couldn\u2019t they at least all sit down together and talk for a half hour and show appreciation for the meal? I would hate a day like this, especially if I worked to put that dinner together - might as well just order a pizza at that point.", "Neither did I. I mentioned sensory overload which is totally different and can happen to anyone.\n\nI'm saying the description of the kitchen would have had me bowing out quickly, no matter how welcome people seemed to be.", "I didn't mention sensory processing issues.\n\nYou can still experience sensory overload and be neurotypical, especially when unprepared.   It would of course be worse if otherwise (diagnosed or not. Let's not forget the disproportionate amount of women who don't get diagnosed until later in life).", "She wasn\u2019t banished to the kitchen. She could have sat with the guys and talked football (which they clearly were interested in) or she wanted to have more active conversations, talked with the women. NAH", "Except it literally says the men folk got up, made themselves a plate, and then went back to the table.\n\nI'm not trying to argue that this 'tradition' isn't sexist, but it does not seem like OP was ever expected to serve anyone.\n\nIt also, in fact, seems like it as never once expected for OP to help out with the food as well.", "I don't think she was expecting to be the center of attention for him, but I do think she was (reasonably) assuming that he would introduce her, start some conversations with her and others, spend a good amount of time hanging out where she was... You know. Providing social lubrication. At the event he invited her to. With his family. That he knows and she doesn't.", "..do you really think the men would all get up and cook a Thanksgiving dinner if the women came in and were like hey we'd rather watch football this year?", "Yeah, I'd definitely choose a Christmas movie in the background whilst cooking & chatting over watching NFL (or any sport not featuring my fave team/competitors) any day. Sounds like the girls in the kitchen would've had the most fun of the day!", "I didn't  mean to imply only Autism. I thought there might be other disorders that could cause that as well. I'm a late in life diagnosis too. Didn't get diagnosed with Autism until 32", "Maybe not literally serve the food directly to them, but the women are expected to engage in service for everyone while the men do nothing. \n\nI don't think OP had the correct reaction though. I'd have hung out with the women and dumped the boyfriend after.", "Funnily enough, that's not what they said.", "100% she can do what she pleases, I just think her attitude about not wanting to talk with the woman because they were around the kitchen was kinda rude", "She had two options though. Join the others in the kitchen or watch Tv with her BF and family. \n\nIt might be a tradition in their family that they are happy to do without enforcing on others. They didn\u2019t complain or say she had to cook in the kitchen. She didn\u2019t want to do that and she was able to join the other activity. \n\nWhat else could be done?", "It sounds like the women are just expected to hang in the kitchen, the closest we got in this post to someone expecting OP to actually do anything was her BF saying \"The family tradition is for the guys to watch football and the ladies hang out in the kitchen and make the meal.\""]}
