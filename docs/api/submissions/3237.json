I told him it was awkward, as I didn't like sports but I didn't want to be banished to the kitchen with \"the women\".

When you try to uncover who they really are, you may be disappointed because what you might find that their real selves have been subsumed.

Leave your judgement at the door and be as pleasant as is possible. \n\nFor years, my Thanksgiving tradition was to throw an informal rather raucous party. My brothers and I did most of the cooking while guests brought desserts and sides. Football might have been on the TV, music was playing, and we would often do goofy childish arts and crafts. These parties were always well attended and a lot of fun. I was with my ex for many many years. This meant that half the time, I was with her family which was just she, her brother, her mom, and her aunt. All of these people were unsociable, boring, quiet, and awkward.

However I do have to say that it was my favorite part of the holidays growing up. The men would be sitting in the living room watching football and the women were technically in the kitchen cooking, but mostly they were in the kitchen drinking and playing poker and the older aunts were telling bawdy stories with a glass of sherry in their hands. We also mostly kept the snacks in the kitchen, so the men didn't get much of that. That was mostly ours.

All the guys (but the host) cleaned everything. Host got to sit on his butt which is all he wanted lmao. It worked great cause we couldn't have trusted those early 20s boys to cook a feast, but damn it they can wash a dish!

That\u2019s not misogyny, that\u2019s just women making the decision to enjoy themselves away from their husbands for a while with like company. \n\nPlus, the men didn\u2019t kick her out of the living room- if the men had a sign in the living room that said \u201cno girlz allowed\u201d or something, then sure I\u2019d go with you there on the misogyny bit.

Yes, most of the women cook and most of the men do chores in the older generation, but in the younger one, it's a lot more evenly split (and if you're not cooking, you're responsible for watching kids, which means the men usually do the majority of the childcare on Thanksgiving.)  \n\nThe main point is everyone is contributing.

Everyone's got traditions they love and if it works for them and they are happy that's their choice. \n\nIf your family loves traditions he may not like thats yalls is like what it is. \nMaybe before Christmas ask about traditions so you don't get mad?  Or you can choose to spend it with your family.  Either way have these big talks so you know what to expect and not be mad. \nLike I said everyone has a right but some like their traditions.  But please be respectful to them about it. \n Tbh I look at a little differently than most I guess. How would I feel if i was with a group of family doing something we were all really into and someone didn't wanna be involved  and someone interrupts what I'm doing to talk about something else other then that. There are two sides here.  I'd try to include them whatever I was talking about but if they don't like it. You're talking about a group of guys talking to you . They talk sports.   If you wanted to be more comfortable talk to the women.  The women are at least talking  and watching movies. \nYou could have found out all the embarrassing stories and fun stuff out your bf.

The men sat around the fire outside while the women did ALL the meal prep and cleaning. If it was just us two couples, I would feel like a lazy bum if I stayed outside with the guys while she was in doing everything. It made me so mad, but apparently that was the agreement that that couple had made and she didn't work outside the home, but he did. Ughhhhh, so gross.

Yeah, he could have escorted you into the kitchen to make introductions and stay at your side. But if this is how his family has always done it? It likely didn't cross his mind. And that's not to say he was right, but also not particularly wrong. No one \"banished\" you anywhere. You could have asked questions about the game and the guys probably would have tried to explain things. Or just gone to hang out in the kitchen. You had a choice. You made a choice. I honestly don't think anyone is the asshole here. Everyone seemed happy with what was going on, except you. So now you know in the future that this is what holidays are like with them.

Did you expect the family to change everything they've been doing for years simply because you were in attendance? \n\nNow granted, your BF should have ensured you were comfortable by introducing you to ALL members of his family and not just a few male members.

The thing that nobody will admit is that the arrangement is based on the idea that male tastes, hobbies and enjoyment are more important so group events should be organized around them.

I\u2019m not a super extroverted person, but if people are around and make even a slight suggestion to include me, I will certainly sit and talk with them.", "This should be on the top. I agree with all of this. Women in my family banish the guys from the kitchen and guess what we are ok with it but they gossip the shit out of all of us.

I can cook a good turkey but they ask us to let them do it.", "You said it beautifully.", "Yea she was focused on the misogyny of it all. We can sometimes forget that people can be happy in traditions like this. \nAlso BF didn't banish her to the kitchen. It's more likely that the many of the women weren't interested in the sports of it all and went to the kitchen themselves.

If OP doesn\u2019t like sports, she was likely annoying them as well as making herself miserable.  I\u2019m all for breaking down sexism, but not by making yourself miserable.  It sounds like OP would have been happier in the kitchen in this specific situation.\n\nI love football and hang out with the men and few other women who do - we also have a small nerd group that watches cool documentaries together, and women with some of the men play board games in the kitchen - they aren\u2019t solely cooking, and the turkey is deep-fried by my dad.  It breaks down mostly be sex, but that is of each person\u2019s choosing, and people wander in and out of the various areas.\n\nOne year one of the new girlfriends did what OP did and kept yammering through the game.  It was at a pivotal moment, tight game with 4th and short for the trailing team in the final minutes, and she suddenly stands in front of the TV and wants everyone\u2019s opinion on what shade of pink her sweater is.

Give me a break.", "I mean, I dunno, in my experience if I'm a guest in someone's house we hang out in the kitchen because football is annoying and loud and woe betide the guest who tries to actually do anything.  That's just the place where the non-football people hang.", "We only stayed until shortly after dinner and went to a friend's for dessert, so I don't really know", "This was my vote too. They never told her she HAD to stay in the kitchen. OP's boyfriend suggested she'd be happier there because she was complaining about football and the lack of chatting.", "This. People are so quick to label it misogynistic when the kitchen is the most fun place to be on Thanksgiving.", "I don\u2019t particularly like cooking, but I like Christmas movies way more than football \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 I\u2019d probably just be hanging out in the kitchen and checking the food for quality control lmao", "It's the equivalent of men not wearing pink because it's perceived as gay. Going into the kitchen and cooking for ya man is seen as a bad thing to this chick lol", "When you live in a misogynistic society and in a misogynistic family theres not a lot of space to feel differently and theres a ton of pressure to do what others are doing.

But she\u2019s an adult. You meet people. I\u2019ve never seen so many people afraid to interact with strangers. Social media has done a wonder! First people afraid to talk on the phone so they text, afraid to approach or be approached to date, so they use Tinder, afraid to answer the door so they speak through ring doorbells. \n\nI\u2019m introverted. Haven\u2019t left my house or spoke to a person all day. But, I do not need someone I know to hold my hand because I\u2019m afraid of strangers. \n\nHow can she expect to get to know family when she\u2019s stuck next to her boyfriend, only engaging with him? It\u2019s not abnormal for women to feel confident enough to engage in conversation and bonding without a male overseer.", "That\u2019s a mighty big leap you\u2019ve made there. \n\nMy ex bfs family had a traditional set up so I would hang out with his mom in the kitchen while she cooked and he and his dad and brother watched football in the living room. I was welcome to join them but it was boring as fuck", "OP said she was uncomfortable and he ignored her and made no effort to make her comfortable with his family.

That lack of invitation suggests she was in fact being banished to the kitchen.", "Yes! I wonder who cooked the thanksgiving meal and prepped in all of the households of the people saying NTA.", "This!!", "This. It blows my mind that there are so many NTA\u2019s\u2026she had two choices and didn\u2019t like either so decided to be incredibly rude at a family holiday for a problem she completely fabricated. Hope the boyfriend sees this as the red flag it is.", "This was my thought too. She went to someone else\u2019s thanksgiving dinner and was given a few different options of activities to participate in. She decided she didn\u2019t want to do any of them and then complained. It\u2019s as simple as that. No need to bring gender roles into this. No one seemed to care that she would prefer watching football instead of doing \u201cwomen kitchen stuff\u201d\u2026until she made it clear that she didn\u2019t actually want to watch football\u2026 she just wanted to interrupt everyone watching football because she would rather them sit around and talk to her instead.

You made an issue out of nothing.", "I didn't think anyone could be this wrong, but here we are.\n\nFar be it for OP to be uncomfortable being expected to help in the kitchen for hours after being invited to Thanksgiving, where the men can't be bothered to do a god damn thing except get their own plate and slunk back to the TV. And you think OP is the entitled one? What a pathetic take.", "I'd like to point out that the women aren't expected to cook. They just usually hang out in the kitchen while some women cook. It's not sexist for this dynamic to exist, it's sexist if the dynamic is automatically expected. Op wasn't asked to cook or stay in the kitchen with the women and many women in the kitchen weren't even cooking, just talking.", "My exes family did too. He did all of the cooking and cleaning in the relationship so, not necessarily the bar.", "How was he expecting her to hop in like a 50s housewife? She was originally sat with the men watching football and then he suggested she could go talk to the ladies when she complained about not liking it. He never asked her to cook or expected her to. And as OP stated, there were a lot of women in the kitchen who weren't cooking at all.", "It's also the fact she said \"I'm upset out here because nobody's talking\" and then followed it up with \"no! I don't wanna go to the kitchen where everyone's talking, it's misogynistic!\"", "Its not her responsibility to help in the kitchen. And she wasn't even warned. \n\nAnd my family was sexist growing up. If I dated a guy who expected me to go help out at the kitchen without warning me, I would be also sitting around or out the door. \n\nShe shouldn't be expected to cook. And maybe she wanted to spend time with her boyfriend.", "Exactly. The women in the kitchen were probably moms who wanted to keep an eye on their kids and make sure the food turned out okay.

Also happy cake day!", "My husband had a similar dynamic on a smaller scale, with his parents, sister, and her husband. And not just Thanksgiving, but any whole-family gathering. He was pretty clueless about the dynamic until I pointed it out. \n\nFor a smaller group, the best solution is not to refuse to help, but that the bf break tradition by getting up and help with the prep and clean up himself. \n\nIn a larger group, the group dynamic is more set. And this gendered dynamic genuinely does work for some people, but unless your bf wants to change it, you're looking at your potential future.", "Yeah I kindof don\u2019t mind this, I don\u2019t have to make food but if it\u2019s more interesting to hang with the ladies then I\u2019d do that. I just treat it like any party \u201coh this isn\u2019t working I\u2019m going over there.\u201d And if neither works I\u2019ll do what\u2019s most comfortable (probably sit and read an e-book) and I just won\u2019t go next time.

He could've encouraged the OP to join him and get to know his female relatives better. It's not perfect, but it would've shown that his expectations aren't like those of his family's patriarchs. Who knows, maybe there are other men in the family who prefer cooking and conversation to watching American football, who might see that and want to join in.", "Empathize with his girlfriend. Tell her, \u201cI know this dynamic is reductive and misogynistic, and I\u2019m very sorry you felt awkward and alienated. I can promise that if we ever have the chance to host Thanksgiving together, it won\u2019t be like that because I don\u2019t want a wife who will serve me; I want to be part of a team.\u201d \n\nWhat OP got was \u201cSuck it up and deal with it, your feelings don\u2019t matter here.\u201d", "And OP didn\u2019t, she raised it with her boyfriend in the context of her feeling uncomfortable \n\nI didn\u2019t read that it was raised with anyone else", "He could have spent some time with her instead of packing her off to the kitchen to be a good little woman and make the men folk dinner who will be exhausted after a hard day sat on their arses watching football.\n\nI agree that at a bare minimum he should have given her a heads up \"this is what we do in my family\" and she can then decide if that's how she wants to spend her day or not.", "So... you mean the kids congregated to where there was food, laughter, and fun Christmas movies rather than boring quiet football? \nDid you want the kids to be bored and hate Thanksgiving?", "No where was it stated that she was expected to cook anything", "That\u2019s nice, but I really don\u2019t enjoy standing around in a kitchen personally. That\u2019s why people should get to do what they want not based on their gender.", "You sir, are a keeper.", "Just to add, it didn't seem that the women were even banished form the area with the men. The women seemed to prefer the kitchen because they can talk about anything and watch tv and munch on food. This is where I'd want to be. I assume the ones who want to cook, bc there are some women who genuinely like to show off their talent, are the only ones who cook. Sure she could have offered to help maybe mash something but it doesn't even seem like they were expecting her to do that. They just wanted to talk and get friendly but OP left. The men weren't upset that OP was in the room with them. They just didn't want to talk about anything other than the game that we were all watching before she got there. Not a crazy concept. She wanted to strike up conversations when they clearly were not there to do that. They weren't rude. She could have easily talked to the women who anted to talk in the kitchen.  I personally would prefer the kitchen just because it seemed lighter and more friendly chat. If she does find error with this system she should probably reflect whether this is the right family for her because I don't think they're going change.", "Yes, and I think the bigger problem is that OP is not familiar with the family and yet thrown into a situation  where striking a conversation is difficult. \n\nNot sure about the dynamics in the kitchen but I guess being a guest it will be more comfortable to be able to be included in the activities and conversations no matter in the kitchen or living room?", "I find it highly unlikely that if she had actually hung out in the kitchen that they would've put her to work. From the very little we were told the women seem pretty cool.", "Because it's very awkward when the only person you know has decided that you are either to sit quietly next to him and not talk or go hope the people she doesn't know are charitable if she does enough service? The point of having a partner at an event like this is the buddy system, and her buddy abandoned her because of a gendered tradition she wasn't informed of.", "It\u2019s not her not wanting to go into the kitchen that makes her the asshole it\u2019s that she was given two options and didn\u2019t like either of them but that\u2019s what was happening that day. A holiday meal was being prepared and people were watching a football game. She didn\u2019t like either option and expected to be catered to. She was welcomed enthusiastically by mom and sister of bf that wasn\u2019t good enough.  She was welcomed to watch the football game in the living room and that was t good enough.  People don\u2019t need to revolve the entire day around one person that\u2019s arrogant and entitled way of thinking.  That\u2019s why she\u2019s the asshole. She knew going in she only knew OP at the family holiday meal. What did she expect?", "plus she was offered a drink, if she really didn't want to work, she should have sucked down her drink and got to know the women.  \nTrying to talk to anyone, man or woman, when they are fixated on a sporting event, is not a realistic goal unless the goal is to irritate the viewers.", "OP sounds like a pick-me and \u201cnot like other girls\u201d. She admitted she\u2019s not interested in football\u2026 so why did she continue to sit there awkwardly when the women in her bf\u2019s family invited her to spend time and talk to them? I feel like women are constantly criticized and looked down on for enjoying stereotypical feminine activities as it is and people like OP ignore the fact that cooking or being in the kitchen is a way of bonding\u2026 maybe they\u2019d show OP some family recipes if she had bothered to hang out with them. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f she made it weird. BTW OP, YTA.", "What may have been misogynistic was her boyfriend assuming she\u2019d be ok with staying in the kitchen.  AH move, not caring if she was comfortable or properly introduced, or even giving her a head\u2019s up.  OP however did not try to make the best of the situation at all.

My husbands family did that, but he mostly stayed with me because I wasn\u2019t really comfortable. They all lived in the same place all their lives and knew everything and everybody and talked about everybody in a small rural area.  I was from a city quite a ways from them, didn\u2019t know anybody, didn\u2019t want to listen to gossip etc.  so he stayed for a very little bit with the men, then came in with the women or I went in with men.  Wasn\u2019t real long til they just all started mingling. Don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen here.  I\u2019ll be honest some of the women would have preferred the separationstaying as it was.", "Yeah, that jumped at me too. When supper is served, you shut the fucking idiot box off and come to the table.", "It doesn\u2019t have to be an explicit rule for it to be socialized sexism.

Anyone walking into this setup would know the expectation just by looking around the room", "I think it\u2019s weird af and would have wanted to leave asap. I\u2019m not socially awkward. I just don\u2019t want to meet a partner\u2019s family for the first time alone without him by side being forced into a sexist setup without warning. An entire day of choosing between being silent or being forced to cook and do child things with a group of people I don\u2019t know? It\u2019s not awkward at all to not want that. It\u2019s just as normal as whatever your perspective is", "It's not abnormal to want to see *your partner who invited you* at some point other than him grabbing his plate or leaving. It's not that she wants a male overseer, it's that she wants the person who invited her to engage with her even a little instead of expecting her to do all that work herself. She was expecting a Day to be made of it, not \"ok, you go over there now.\"", "I agree. When you start a new job you put yourself out there and introduce yourself, ask their name, etc. Volunteering, PTA, classes, you meet people. It\u2019s not weird to make friendly with your bfs family. Why does bf have to hold her hand?

That is weird.", "The fact that none of the men helped make any food, set the table, or sat together and enjoyed family time with the women is enough for me to see that this is not the family environment OP wants for her future. I also would not want to spend time with those men. It\u2019s disrespectful to ignore a guest and not even bother to get to know them when they try to make conversation.", "That's alot of assumptions you are making, yikes.", "Eh, NTA. That tradition is sexist and it's fucked up he didn't properly warn you and expected you to play along because it's \"tradition\". You've been put into a situation where you could only lose. The only other thing you could have done would be to overplay it and swallow your pride and go to the kitchen with the other women. I'm rolling my eyes writing this.\nWould i have done that? Probably. Would i be disappointed in myself and my partner afterwards? Yup. \n\nINFO: Is he an okay partner normally? Does he listen to you and acknowledge your feelings? Does he understand how uncomfortable the situation he put you into is?", "A good way to weed out the ones that aren\u2019t THE ONE is by seeing how well they get along with your family. My daughter is 9 and can walk into an event knowing only my husband and I and walk out with a room full of friends. You have to be willing to put yourself out there a bit for his family to get to know you, if you see a future with this man. It doesn\u2019t seem like you tried to get to know ANYONE.

A group very much in to whatever ball game is on, a group talking up a storm and drinking while people cook in the kitchen, the octogenarians reminiscing at the dining table, a pack of feral children stealing food. It's not divided by men and women, a little age but you're welcome to sit in with any group and participate as much as you want. OP might have enjoyed sitting in the kitchen with the women but it sounds like she wasn't comfortable enough to go alone, she should have asked bf to join her for a bit and introduce her.", "As someone who grew up in this kind of lifestyle, the women would've told OP's boyfriend to get out of what was already a crowded kitchen.", "What I\u2019m saying is, there\u2019s not really anything he could have done at that moment to help her out. The people chatting were in the kitchen and she decided not to join them.", "Obviously no one wants kids to be bored during thanksgiving, but the women can\u2019t be the only ones responsible for the children just because of the atmosphere.

Italian-American family here and same. Mostly women in the kitchen/dining room, mostly men in the living room. Totally cool to rotate if you want, also totally cool to set up shop in one or the other all day regardless of gender. I (female) tend to find the kitchen more fun, my husband (who graciously married into our crazy) spends more time in the living room.\n\nI've never seen it as sexist or weird though. Just that women tend to relate better with other women and same for men. It's not like anyone actually forced OP into the kitchen or anything.", "I especially don't enjoy standing around in a kitchen full of people I don't know. I'm terribly shy and can't make small talk to save my life, so I just don't say anything until I'm ready to burst with tears. This entire scenario is some people's nightmare.", "Did they prohibit her from watching the game?", "It doesn\u2019t sound as though anyone had a problem with her hanging out in the living room, though? If she had been interested in football, I doubt anyone would have batted an eye. It sounds like she was obviously NOT into football, and no one batted an eye. The dynamic might be gendered, and that might be worth examining, but no one asked her to set the table or help with cooking. That would be a problem with his family. \n\nIf I were in that situation, I\u2019d be angry at my boyfriend for throwing me into his family dinner with no introduction or help getting to know them. I\u2019d bet she would have felt just as abandoned if there had been mixed genders in both rooms. He walked into the house, grabbed a beer, and told her to fend for herself for the rest of the day. She\u2019s focusing on his family dynamic, but he\u2019s the only one who behaved rudely (according to the post.)", "She might not want that information about a misogynist she\u2019ll most likely be dumping.

Gender roles aside, OP was expected to mix with people she had either barely or never met.  In that scenario, I would want my bf to stay with me for at least part of the time to make me comfortable, rather than being with strangers.", "So we should high-five the family for not telling her she was unwelcome watching football? The point is she wasn\u2019t told in advance about any of this and why should she have to spend the holiday quietly sitting down watching a sport that the gf said she wasn\u2019t really interested in?

There's no indication that the women in this story were anything but happy with the arrangement", "Yes. Because I doubt that 15 people preparing food is that big of a task that they would all boycott, no notice, without any type of adult conversation. \n\nI, personally, enjoy food prep, especially if I can snack, watch Christmas movies and converse with other women. So, even.if all the \"menfolk\" are watching football myself and quite a few other women will continue cooking because, you know, we enjoy it.", "Sounds like there was a TV set up in the kitchen, since OP mentions Christmas movies playing. It doesn't sound like anyone was forced or excluded, so I'm leaning NAH", "Yes. Usually women do the cooking in my house but when we are more social the men pick up the slack.", "because the person she knows is her boyfriend, most likely and probably felt a bit anxious to separate from him.", "Yes!", "I can see your point. And I think I forget that like\u2026 I\u2019ve known my in laws for almost 10 years, and I probably have forgotten the anxiety of thanksgiving with your SO if it\u2019s the first or second time. In that case, he should have tried to mingle with her more- went in to the kitchen to get conversation started maybe and then frequently checked in on her and the gals or talked to her more during the game and tried getting her involved in conversation with the guys. \n\nBut yes, she also could have done more to make the best of the situation.", "Personally, I enjoy some separation time from my husband at gatherings. I love the man, but I live with him lol I see him all the time. It\u2019s nice to have some breathing room.Typically, he goes and plays with the kids/nephews with his brother and they catch up, and I chat in the kitchen and talk with my SIL and MIL. I enjoy this dynamic, and we all come back together for dinner and then usually separate again.

Have them play in the same room so they can watch the game and still keep an eye on them? Wild.", "Yes. IF they want to. It doesn't seem like this family wanted to. There was absolutely nothing stopping the women from \"chilling\" in the living room. Other than them enjoying the kitchen atmosphere more. \n\nThe only person complaining is OP. Who went into the living room.", "This may be true for most people, but since OP's BF verbatim told her that the men sitting and watching football, drinking beer while the women go in the kitchen to cook and talk was their tradition, I still think they're sexist. \n\nFrankly I'd be disappointed just because he said they make a whole day of it, which to me makes it seem like they do stuff OTHER than food prep for Thanksgiving fun while they have the whole family around, like games and stuff.", "I would agree with you but ONLY the women were in the kitchen and hey BF basically told her that's where she should go.", "I used to think it was so weird that a lot of people play board games or party games at family holidays. But now I understand that that\u2019s because a multigenerational family is often a group of people without many shared interests.

They\u2019re just pointing out that she could\u2019ve learned a lot. The women were welcoming and warm to her and she chose to go into the other room where they were already watching football. That\u2019s like walking up to a group of people playing cornhole and horseshoes and then complaining that you don\u2019t like yard games. Like wtf. They were already doing that thing before you got there. We\u2019re they supposed to turn the games off? That would\u2019ve made it even more awkward.

Pick one", "If they were misogynistic they wouldn't have let her stay with the men and watch the game.", "I wish I had an award to give for this.", "Yup. It was on OP's boyfriend to hangout with her in the kitchen area and help her integrate better with the family. Instead, he chose to be selfish and watch the match.", "Then she could've chatted up the women who warmly invited her to join them and offered her a drink.", "Except.... no one said she had to cook or help cook. She was invited to hang out with them while They are cooking and having fun. Football games are not for talking and getting to know someone. \n\nAnd besides, when did it become a bad thing to be a girl? I love being a girl and just so happen to love cooking so everyone comes to chill with me in the kitchen \ud83d\ude0a She chose to be miserable because gawd forbid she would have to set foot in a kitchen to enjoy herself. \nY'all are seriously missing out on so much fun in life by always trying to be mightier than thou.\n\nIf the ladies were hanging in the living room instead of the kitchen, would she have still hollered misogyny?", "Nowhere was it stated she was expected to help\n\nYou're making up your own additions", "So the men could just as easily have watched football in the kitchen and cooked while they did so, while women sat and watched movies until the meal was ready. And yet, I would bet money they would never agree to that. It doesn't have to be \"forced\" to make it a stupid \"tradition\".", "Yes there is\u2026.. it would not be cooked.  And the women would be blamed for it.  This \u201ctradition\u201d goes back at least 3 generations possibly 4 depending on how old OP is - since football games were televised  in the 1950\u2019s.", "Then grow the fuck up. This is some first day of kindergarten shit. I don\u2019t know how some of these people get through the first day of work at a new job.", "She said she\u2019d met the bf\u2019s mom and sister a few times before so that\u2019s not true.", "Yeah, I've been warned that the groups for the Thanksgiving I'm going to tomorrow (haven't seen this part of the family in 9 years) breaks apart into the heavy drinkers and thise who don't. So yay.... \n\nBut yeah, everyone breaks up into their \"groups\" because of like interests. Most of these groups will slowly merge and break apart.", "I never saw the shed this way before. I might latch onto this.", "Aye, but there\u2019s no space at all in the bf\u2019s family\u2019s setup for anything else. There\u2019s no flexibility, no diversity. It\u2019s one way or nothing at all. No place for women who don\u2019t want to muck about with children, or only cook and hang with other women all day. Seriously\u2014six hours or or of strange women\u2019s small talk and no connection with the person who brought me? I\u2019d be so bored.", "Me too.", "This. OP WAS out with the guys watching the game. She brought up not wanting to sit there and watch the game with them because nobody was talking, and the boyfriend suggested she could to talk to the others in the kitchen. Nobody was forcing her to do anything.", "Sure it may have had you bow out due to sensory overload, but what the commenter you are replying to is saying is that  op never said that was an issue. their only cited issue was that it was sexist.", "Do you know if OP was experiencing sensory overload?? It doesn\u2019t matter how you *would have felt*", "He didn't throw her in the kitchen, nor did he toss her out of the living room either! \n\nNo one asked her to do food prep OR  watch kids. If *that* had happened, I'd be with you. Oh heck no, we are gonna have a convo.\n\nHe just said that is where the people who talk hang out and talk up a storm when she said she was feeling uncomfortable (that's not on the table here though, which is unfortunate).\n\nShe said in another comment that there were women who weren't doing food prep that were just hanging out and chatting. \n\nSo...just hang out and talk with people who actually want to talk and be social? I think it's the locations that is the the problem which happens to be broken out along 1950s white middle class gender systems.", "And so was this family. No one objected to OP going to the living room and hanging out with the men.", "Jesus Christ this has to be a Guinness world record for reaching. You got all that from her being nice to OP?", "I disagree that it is sexist. I see it as how this family just splits apart. No one was forced or coerced one way or another. Saying \"men can't watch football\" is sexist. If THAT family I'd happy with how.it is, then it is NOT wrong.", "Fair enough.", "Families can do as they please", "I think it was a poor choice of words on his part. Because if the tradition was for men to watch football and women to stay in the kitchen than they w weouldn't have let her in the living room when she tried or the other women would have stopped her from leaving the kitchen. I don't think the tradition is \"MEN in the living room and WOMEN in the kitchen\" I think it's \"FOOTBALL in the living room and TALKING in the kitchen\". Does that make sesne? It's just that up until not all the men chose the living room and all the women chose the kitchen. (Technically this is still the case. OP wanted to talk. But for some reason she wanted to talk in the football watching room.) \n\nCooking and watching football IS a whole day of fun for some people. My fianc\u00e9's favorite thing is to sit on the couch and watch football. *I* don't get it, but it makes him happy. I, on the other hand, would love to spend the whole day cooking and talking. So I don't think it was strange that the boyfriend described it as\"making a whole day out of it\". It is a whole day of fun for them. I think it's completely find that OP isn't loving this situation. Some people are just too different in all the wrong ways. Nothing wrong with that. But I also don't think everyone else is an AH for being okay with their Thanksgiving arrangements. \n\nI do think it would have been nice of the BF to stay with her in the kitchen for a few minutes until she got acclimated with everyone.", "I mean he was right. She didn't want to watch football so she would have been happier in the kitchen where there was no football. And I guess no other women wanted to watch it either. And I guess none of the guys wanted to cook or talk. That's all okay. It's okay to conform to stereotypical gender norms if that's what makes you happy. It's also okay for OP to not like it. But it's not okay for OP to think other people should stop doing what makes them happy because it doesn't make her happy. I'm not sure if I explained that well or not.", "I agree with you.", "But the family is not *him*. That\u2019s getting to know the relatives \u2014 not interrogating them about his past which is what the comment suggested. All their examples revolved around him when she probably already knows her bf and was more interested in the others. \n\nYes; she could\u2019ve sucked it up in order to accomplish her goal but she was stuck between a rock and a hard place. Either she: 1) performs obligatory traditionally female labor in order to \u201cget to know the family\u201d \u2014 which would just have been the women or 2) avoids the labor she does not enjoy to hang out w/ her bf but he\u2019s gonna ignore her to be one of the guys. There\u2019s no winning for OP.", "She did.", "Fixed a plate and went back to the TV, she said. If the women sat at a table I hope OP at least joined them then.", "Getting your own plate is the literal least amount of effort the men could have put forth lol. To act like cooking and preparing the entire meal isn't \"serving\" people because the men were able to tear themselves away from the TV for 30 seconds is laughable. \n\nWho do you think was responsible for cleaning everything up? Hint: I'll bet it wasn't the men.", "It stupid too you, doesn't make it stupid for everyone. Stop FORCING your values on others.", "So basically taking the people that are happy to cook and replacing them by the people who would no be?", "Maybe the women like doing it? There\u2019s a similar arrangement in my family because while both parties enjoy cooking, the women insist on it. Don\u2019t know what OP expected. If you don\u2019t like watching football and don\u2019t like hanging out in the kitchen, then go home.", "Everybody's mad about men not cooking. I would roll over and die before eating anything the men in my family cooked.", "Bingo.", "We don't know how old she is. It could be her first time being an in law. We don't know her personal life, whether she's prone to social anxiety or not. His family sounds massive and some people don't do well in large groups of strangers.", "Doesn't mean they're close or she feels comfortable with the. there was about 15 of them as well, ans they know each other well as family. She came with her boyfriend, and the mum and the sister probably wouldn't have been solely socialising with her so she'd be left on her own a bit. Sounds intimidating to me!", "Sure can. Even if that means upholding ridiculous family traditions where all the responsibilities fall upon the women of the family.", "Man I would be SOL at your Thanksgiving. I hate football AND cooking. This makes me feel like there should be some sort of disclosure or something. Like \"hey, two options for tomorrow. Hopefully you like one of them\"", "This is the perfect explanation! If they would have chased her out for being a woman folk, then it would have been an issue. But she was doing the wrong activity in the wrong room. The BF should have made sure she felt comfortable in an unfamiliar place instead of just assuming OP could dive right in and start acting like old friends with everyone was shitty of him. HE is comfortable there so he may have forgotten SHE wasn't comfortable there and totally innocently too. Personally, I can start up conversations with just about anyone and I rarely meet a stranger. 2 of my 3 kiddos are the same. My husband and our oldest are the opposite. They are not totally hopeless and awkward, but they are not randomly making friends in public like the rest of us are either. OP sounds like my husband and oldest. The boyfriend needs to be a good person and help her out with introductions.", "So then she shouldn't whine.  She wasn't banned from hanging out with the guys. She just didn't like what their event had.", "Idk if it was just op\u2019s word choice but she said most, not all of the women were doing food prep, idk if it was actually expected of her to help out in the kitchen or she was just welcome to join them and hang out.", "That's called weaponized incompetence.", "Sometimes things are between the lines", "I\u2019m prone to social anxiety, I had to integrate into a large loud family. Was it my favorite thing ever? No. Did I do it because I knew it was important to my SO? Yes. Have a drink, talk, and try to be normal.", "Sounds like she expected for everyone\u2019s attention to be on her or for everyone to reach out to her when it goes both ways? And also yeah they wouldn\u2019t have just been focused on her because thanksgiving is about spending time with family and friends\u2026 there\u2019s probably people they haven\u2019t seen in a long time and they wouldn\u2019t be wrong for interacting with everyone. The mom and sister were being welcoming and OP decided she\u2019d rather sit with all the men watching a football game that she wasn\u2019t interested in, while complaining that it was awkward. It seems the men weren\u2019t talking to her and her bf was paying attention to the game, so why didn\u2019t she just go socialize with people that were actually talking and socializing?", "Hahahaha! I mean we try to be good hosts, you wouldn't be forced to do either! Do you like to read or crochet? I do those things too. \ud83d\ude02 My fianc\u00e9...uhh...yeah no he just watches sports. Hahaha! I think a lot of families are different and you just kind of know that in life. I don't really expect other families to be just like mine. I think it's only an issue when you're dating/thinking about marrying into said family. Like I can be bored for a few hours at a friends house. But marry into that? Ehh no.", "Definitely think it could have been an innocent mistake on the boyfriend's part. OP's boyfriend and you sound a lot like my fianc\u00e9. He never meets a stranger and had no problem chatting with anyone and everyone. I am soooo socially awkward and always anxious in social situations. So it was really hard for me when we first started dating and his family would throw these big parties all the time. And he knew and loved these people so it never occurred to him that I might feel awkward. Thankfully his mom picked up on it and helped me. (God I miss that women. I hit the MIL jackpot with her.) Granted, he was only 19 (I was 17). But I can still see how even an adult might not pick up on it. Especially if they're naturally just social AND around people they already know and are comfortable with.", "The ladies have to make the meal while the dudes just get to hang out and drink beer. Women are expected to hang out in the kitchen? What is this? The 1940s? Cmon.", "Sometimes, yeah, but this isn't one of those times.", "Yes but people do what is more comfortable to them in difficult situations. That would be staying near their SO. That's the done thing if you're a +1.", "Yeah you are right. I feel she felt out of her depth in both situations (with her boyfriend but felt awkward) and with a lot of people she didn't know and misinterpreted this discomfort as her being uncomfortable because its misogynistic. But her feeling banished is probably from her feeling abandoned by her boyfriend, with the added layer of possibly looking after the kids and cooking the dinner.", "I think people always go into things assuming that there is malice and/or a set up in everything instead of the actual innocence of the situation. Because I will just go and chat to people, especially cute little kids because I wanted to be a Speech Language Pathological, even got as far as finishing my first semester of grad school before my physical disabilities put the brakes on that. We also got married young, 19 and 18 and are 37 and 36 now and he knows to just let me kinda go off and socialize for a bit lol. If OP feels like the situation is sexist, then maybe that is how she is viewing it, but I think if she looks at it through our lens, it may change her view. Not men vs women, but talking vs football.", "Then sit there and watch football even if you don\u2019t like it and not bitch about it. My in laws watch the Santa Clause 3 every year, it\u2019s an ass movie but it\u2019s their favorite movie. Guess what I watch every year with them without a peep of complaint? Fucking Santa Clause 3. Because I know it\u2019s important to them. Adapt or be alone."]}
