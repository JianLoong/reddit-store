The family tradition is for the guys to watch football and the ladies hang out in the kitchen and make the meal.\"\n\nI told him I found that extremely misogynistic, and I was not interested in \"going to the kitchen\" while the men sat around drinking and watching TV.\n\nI ended up just sitting around awkwardly watching them all talk sports until basically dinner was served, at which point  they got up, got a plate and went back to watching tv. \n\nI told my bf after that I was upset and he said I was over reacting. I told him it was awkward, as I didn't like sports but I didn't want to be banished to the kitchen with \"the women\".

When you try to uncover who they really are, you may be disappointed because what you might find that their real selves have been subsumed.

Leave your judgement at the door and be as pleasant as is possible. \n\nFor years, my Thanksgiving tradition was to throw an informal rather raucous party. My brothers and I did most of the cooking while guests brought desserts and sides. Football might have been on the TV, music was playing, and we would often do goofy childish arts and crafts. These parties were always well attended and a lot of fun. I was with my ex for many many years. This meant that half the time, I was with her family which was just she, her brother, her mom, and her aunt. All of these people were unsociable, boring, quiet, and awkward.

However I do have to say that it was my favorite part of the holidays growing up. The men would be sitting in the living room watching football and the women were technically in the kitchen cooking, but mostly they were in the kitchen drinking and playing poker and the older aunts were telling bawdy stories with a glass of sherry in their hands. We also mostly kept the snacks in the kitchen, so the men didn't get much of that. That was mostly ours.

All the guys (but the host) cleaned everything. Host got to sit on his butt which is all he wanted lmao. It worked great cause we couldn't have trusted those early 20s boys to cook a feast, but damn it they can wash a dish!

That\u2019s not misogyny, that\u2019s just women making the decision to enjoy themselves away from their husbands for a while with like company. \n\nPlus, the men didn\u2019t kick her out of the living room- if the men had a sign in the living room that said \u201cno girlz allowed\u201d or something, then sure I\u2019d go with you there on the misogyny bit.

Yes, most of the women cook and most of the men do chores in the older generation, but in the younger one, it's a lot more evenly split (and if you're not cooking, you're responsible for watching kids, which means the men usually do the majority of the childcare on Thanksgiving.)  \n\nThe main point is everyone is contributing.

Everyone's got traditions they love and if it works for them and they are happy that's their choice. \n\nIf your family loves traditions he may not like thats yalls is like what it is. \nMaybe before Christmas ask about traditions so you don't get mad?  Or you can choose to spend it with your family.  Either way have these big talks so you know what to expect and not be mad. \nLike I said everyone has a right but some like their traditions.  But please be respectful to them about it. \n Tbh I look at a little differently than most I guess. How would I feel if i was with a group of family doing something we were all really into and someone didn't wanna be involved  and someone interrupts what I'm doing to talk about something else other then that. There are two sides here.  I'd try to include them whatever I was talking about but if they don't like it. You're talking about a group of guys talking to you . They talk sports.   If you wanted to be more comfortable talk to the women.  The women are at least talking  and watching movies. \nYou could have found out all the embarrassing stories and fun stuff out your bf.

The men sat around the fire outside while the women did ALL the meal prep and cleaning. If it was just us two couples, I would feel like a lazy bum if I stayed outside with the guys while she was in doing everything. It made me so mad, but apparently that was the agreement that that couple had made and she didn't work outside the home, but he did. Ughhhhh, so gross.

Yeah, he could have escorted you into the kitchen to make introductions and stay at your side. But if this is how his family has always done it? It likely didn't cross his mind. And that's not to say he was right, but also not particularly wrong. No one \"banished\" you anywhere. You could have asked questions about the game and the guys probably would have tried to explain things. Or just gone to hang out in the kitchen. You had a choice. You made a choice. I honestly don't think anyone is the asshole here. Everyone seemed happy with what was going on, except you. So now you know in the future that this is what holidays are like with them.

Did you expect the family to change everything they've been doing for years simply because you were in attendance? \n\nNow granted, your BF should have ensured you were comfortable by introducing you to ALL members of his family and not just a few male members.

The thing that nobody will admit is that the arrangement is based on the idea that male tastes, hobbies and enjoyment are more important so group events should be organized around them.

I\u2019m not a super extroverted person, but if people are around and make even a slight suggestion to include me, I will certainly sit and talk with them.", "This should be on the top. I agree with all of this. Women in my family banish the guys from the kitchen and guess what we are ok with it but they gossip the shit out of all of us.

I can cook a good turkey but they ask us to let them do it.", "You said it beautifully.", "Yea she was focused on the misogyny of it all. We can sometimes forget that people can be happy in traditions like this. \nAlso BF didn't banish her to the kitchen. It's more likely that the many of the women weren't interested in the sports of it all and went to the kitchen themselves.

If OP doesn\u2019t like sports, she was likely annoying them as well as making herself miserable.  I\u2019m all for breaking down sexism, but not by making yourself miserable.  It sounds like OP would have been happier in the kitchen in this specific situation.\n\nI love football and hang out with the men and few other women who do - we also have a small nerd group that watches cool documentaries together, and women with some of the men play board games in the kitchen - they aren\u2019t solely cooking, and the turkey is deep-fried by my dad.  It breaks down mostly be sex, but that is of each person\u2019s choosing, and people wander in and out of the various areas.\n\nOne year one of the new girlfriends did what OP did and kept yammering through the game.  It was at a pivotal moment, tight game with 4th and short for the trailing team in the final minutes, and she suddenly stands in front of the TV and wants everyone\u2019s opinion on what shade of pink her sweater is.

Give me a break.", "I mean, I dunno, in my experience if I'm a guest in someone's house we hang out in the kitchen because football is annoying and loud and woe betide the guest who tries to actually do anything.  That's just the place where the non-football people hang.", "We only stayed until shortly after dinner and went to a friend's for dessert, so I don't really know", "This was my vote too. They never told her she HAD to stay in the kitchen. OP's boyfriend suggested she'd be happier there because she was complaining about football and the lack of chatting.", "This. People are so quick to label it misogynistic when the kitchen is the most fun place to be on Thanksgiving.", "I don\u2019t particularly like cooking, but I like Christmas movies way more than football \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 I\u2019d probably just be hanging out in the kitchen and checking the food for quality control lmao", "It's the equivalent of men not wearing pink because it's perceived as gay. Going into the kitchen and cooking for ya man is seen as a bad thing to this chick lol", "When you live in a misogynistic society and in a misogynistic family theres not a lot of space to feel differently and theres a ton of pressure to do what others are doing.

But she\u2019s an adult. You meet people. I\u2019ve never seen so many people afraid to interact with strangers. Social media has done a wonder! First people afraid to talk on the phone so they text, afraid to approach or be approached to date, so they use Tinder, afraid to answer the door so they speak through ring doorbells. \n\nI\u2019m introverted. Haven\u2019t left my house or spoke to a person all day. But, I do not need someone I know to hold my hand because I\u2019m afraid of strangers. \n\nHow can she expect to get to know family when she\u2019s stuck next to her boyfriend, only engaging with him? It\u2019s not abnormal for women to feel confident enough to engage in conversation and bonding without a male overseer.", "That\u2019s a mighty big leap you\u2019ve made there. \n\nMy ex bfs family had a traditional set up so I would hang out with his mom in the kitchen while she cooked and he and his dad and brother watched football in the living room. I was welcome to join them but it was boring as fuck", "OP said she was uncomfortable and he ignored her and made no effort to make her comfortable with his family.

That lack of invitation suggests she was in fact being banished to the kitchen.", "Yes! I wonder who cooked the thanksgiving meal and prepped in all of the households of the people saying NTA.", "This!!", "This. It blows my mind that there are so many NTA\u2019s\u2026she had two choices and didn\u2019t like either so decided to be incredibly rude at a family holiday for a problem she completely fabricated. Hope the boyfriend sees this as the red flag it is.", "This was my thought too. She went to someone else\u2019s thanksgiving dinner and was given a few different options of activities to participate in. She decided she didn\u2019t want to do any of them and then complained. It\u2019s as simple as that. No need to bring gender roles into this. No one seemed to care that she would prefer watching football instead of doing \u201cwomen kitchen stuff\u201d\u2026until she made it clear that she didn\u2019t actually want to watch football\u2026 she just wanted to interrupt everyone watching football because she would rather them sit around and talk to her instead.

You made an issue out of nothing.", "I didn't think anyone could be this wrong, but here we are.\n\nFar be it for OP to be uncomfortable being expected to help in the kitchen for hours after being invited to Thanksgiving, where the men can't be bothered to do a god damn thing except get their own plate and slunk back to the TV. And you think OP is the entitled one? What a pathetic take.", "I'd like to point out that the women aren't expected to cook. They just usually hang out in the kitchen while some women cook. It's not sexist for this dynamic to exist, it's sexist if the dynamic is automatically expected. Op wasn't asked to cook or stay in the kitchen with the women and many women in the kitchen weren't even cooking, just talking.", "My exes family did too. He did all of the cooking and cleaning in the relationship so, not necessarily the bar.", "How was he expecting her to hop in like a 50s housewife? She was originally sat with the men watching football and then he suggested she could go talk to the ladies when she complained about not liking it. He never asked her to cook or expected her to. And as OP stated, there were a lot of women in the kitchen who weren't cooking at all.", "It's also the fact she said \"I'm upset out here because nobody's talking\" and then followed it up with \"no! I don't wanna go to the kitchen where everyone's talking, it's misogynistic!\"", "Its not her responsibility to help in the kitchen. And she wasn't even warned. \n\nAnd my family was sexist growing up. If I dated a guy who expected me to go help out at the kitchen without warning me, I would be also sitting around or out the door. \n\nShe shouldn't be expected to cook. And maybe she wanted to spend time with her boyfriend.", "Exactly. The women in the kitchen were probably moms who wanted to keep an eye on their kids and make sure the food turned out okay.

Also happy cake day!", "My husband had a similar dynamic on a smaller scale, with his parents, sister, and her husband. And not just Thanksgiving, but any whole-family gathering. He was pretty clueless about the dynamic until I pointed it out. \n\nFor a smaller group, the best solution is not to refuse to help, but that the bf break tradition by getting up and help with the prep and clean up himself. \n\nIn a larger group, the group dynamic is more set. And this gendered dynamic genuinely does work for some people, but unless your bf wants to change it, you're looking at your potential future.", "Yeah I kindof don\u2019t mind this, I don\u2019t have to make food but if it\u2019s more interesting to hang with the ladies then I\u2019d do that. I just treat it like any party \u201coh this isn\u2019t working I\u2019m going over there.\u201d And if neither works I\u2019ll do what\u2019s most comfortable (probably sit and read an e-book) and I just won\u2019t go next time.

He could've encouraged the OP to join him and get to know his female relatives better. It's not perfect, but it would've shown that his expectations aren't like those of his family's patriarchs. Who knows, maybe there are other men in the family who prefer cooking and conversation to watching American football, who might see that and want to join in.", "Empathize with his girlfriend. Tell her, \u201cI know this dynamic is reductive and misogynistic, and I\u2019m very sorry you felt awkward and alienated. I can promise that if we ever have the chance to host Thanksgiving together, it won\u2019t be like that because I don\u2019t want a wife who will serve me; I want to be part of a team.\u201d \n\nWhat OP got was \u201cSuck it up and deal with it, your feelings don\u2019t matter here.\u201d", "And OP didn\u2019t, she raised it with her boyfriend in the context of her feeling uncomfortable \n\nI didn\u2019t read that it was raised with anyone else", "He could have spent some time with her instead of packing her off to the kitchen to be a good little woman and make the men folk dinner who will be exhausted after a hard day sat on their arses watching football.\n\nI agree that at a bare minimum he should have given her a heads up \"this is what we do in my family\" and she can then decide if that's how she wants to spend her day or not.", "So... you mean the kids congregated to where there was food, laughter, and fun Christmas movies rather than boring quiet football? \nDid you want the kids to be bored and hate Thanksgiving?", "No where was it stated that she was expected to cook anything", "That\u2019s nice, but I really don\u2019t enjoy standing around in a kitchen personally. That\u2019s why people should get to do what they want not based on their gender.", "You sir, are a keeper.", "Just to add, it didn't seem that the women were even banished form the area with the men. The women seemed to prefer the kitchen because they can talk about anything and watch tv and munch on food. This is where I'd want to be. I assume the ones who want to cook, bc there are some women who genuinely like to show off their talent, are the only ones who cook. Sure she could have offered to help maybe mash something but it doesn't even seem like they were expecting her to do that. They just wanted to talk and get friendly but OP left. The men weren't upset that OP was in the room with them. They just didn't want to talk about anything other than the game that we were all watching before she got there. Not a crazy concept. She wanted to strike up conversations when they clearly were not there to do that. They weren't rude. She could have easily talked to the women who anted to talk in the kitchen.  I personally would prefer the kitchen just because it seemed lighter and more friendly chat. If she does find error with this system she should probably reflect whether this is the right family for her because I don't think they're going change.", "Yes, and I think the bigger problem is that OP is not familiar with the family and yet thrown into a situation  where striking a conversation is difficult. \n\nNot sure about the dynamics in the kitchen but I guess being a guest it will be more comfortable to be able to be included in the activities and conversations no matter in the kitchen or living room?", "I find it highly unlikely that if she had actually hung out in the kitchen that they would've put her to work. From the very little we were told the women seem pretty cool.", "Because it's very awkward when the only person you know has decided that you are either to sit quietly next to him and not talk or go hope the people she doesn't know are charitable if she does enough service? The point of having a partner at an event like this is the buddy system, and her buddy abandoned her because of a gendered tradition she wasn't informed of.", "It\u2019s not her not wanting to go into the kitchen that makes her the asshole it\u2019s that she was given two options and didn\u2019t like either of them but that\u2019s what was happening that day. A holiday meal was being prepared and people were watching a football game. She didn\u2019t like either option and expected to be catered to. She was welcomed enthusiastically by mom and sister of bf that wasn\u2019t good enough.  She was welcomed to watch the football game in the living room and that was t good enough.  People don\u2019t need to revolve the entire day around one person that\u2019s arrogant and entitled way of thinking.  That\u2019s why she\u2019s the asshole. She knew going in she only knew OP at the family holiday meal. What did she expect?", "plus she was offered a drink, if she really didn't want to work, she should have sucked down her drink and got to know the women.  \nTrying to talk to anyone, man or woman, when they are fixated on a sporting event, is not a realistic goal unless the goal is to irritate the viewers.", "OP sounds like a pick-me and \u201cnot like other girls\u201d. She admitted she\u2019s not interested in football\u2026 so why did she continue to sit there awkwardly when the women in her bf\u2019s family invited her to spend time and talk to them? I feel like women are constantly criticized and looked down on for enjoying stereotypical feminine activities as it is and people like OP ignore the fact that cooking or being in the kitchen is a way of bonding\u2026 maybe they\u2019d show OP some family recipes if she had bothered to hang out with them. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f she made it weird. BTW OP, YTA.", "What may have been misogynistic was her boyfriend assuming she\u2019d be ok with staying in the kitchen.  AH move, not caring if she was comfortable or properly introduced, or even giving her a head\u2019s up.  OP however did not try to make the best of the situation at all.

My husbands family did that, but he mostly stayed with me because I wasn\u2019t really comfortable. They all lived in the same place all their lives and knew everything and everybody and talked about everybody in a small rural area.  I was from a city quite a ways from them, didn\u2019t know anybody, didn\u2019t want to listen to gossip etc.  so he stayed for a very little bit with the men, then came in with the women or I went in with men.  Wasn\u2019t real long til they just all started mingling. Don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen here.  I\u2019ll be honest some of the women would have preferred the separationstaying as it was.", "Yeah, that jumped at me too. When supper is served, you shut the fucking idiot box off and come to the table.", "It doesn\u2019t have to be an explicit rule for it to be socialized sexism.

Anyone walking into this setup would know the expectation just by looking around the room", "I think it\u2019s weird af and would have wanted to leave asap. I\u2019m not socially awkward. I just don\u2019t want to meet a partner\u2019s family for the first time alone without him by side being forced into a sexist setup without warning. An entire day of choosing between being silent or being forced to cook and do child things with a group of people I don\u2019t know? It\u2019s not awkward at all to not want that. It\u2019s just as normal as whatever your perspective is", "It's not abnormal to want to see *your partner who invited you* at some point other than him grabbing his plate or leaving. It's not that she wants a male overseer, it's that she wants the person who invited her to engage with her even a little instead of expecting her to do all that work herself. She was expecting a Day to be made of it, not \"ok, you go over there now.\"", "I agree. When you start a new job you put yourself out there and introduce yourself, ask their name, etc. Volunteering, PTA, classes, you meet people. It\u2019s not weird to make friendly with your bfs family. Why does bf have to hold her hand?

That is weird.", "The fact that none of the men helped make any food, set the table, or sat together and enjoyed family time with the women is enough for me to see that this is not the family environment OP wants for her future. I also would not want to spend time with those men. It\u2019s disrespectful to ignore a guest and not even bother to get to know them when they try to make conversation.", "That's alot of assumptions you are making, yikes.", "Eh, NTA. That tradition is sexist and it's fucked up he didn't properly warn you and expected you to play along because it's \"tradition\". You've been put into a situation where you could only lose. The only other thing you could have done would be to overplay it and swallow your pride and go to the kitchen with the other women. I'm rolling my eyes writing this.\nWould i have done that? Probably. Would i be disappointed in myself and my partner afterwards? Yup. \n\nINFO: Is he an okay partner normally? Does he listen to you and acknowledge your feelings? Does he understand how uncomfortable the situation he put you into is?", "A good way to weed out the ones that aren\u2019t THE ONE is by seeing how well they get along with your family. My daughter is 9 and can walk into an event knowing only my husband and I and walk out with a room full of friends. You have to be willing to put yourself out there a bit for his family to get to know you, if you see a future with this man. It doesn\u2019t seem like you tried to get to know ANYONE.

A group very much in to whatever ball game is on, a group talking up a storm and drinking while people cook in the kitchen, the octogenarians reminiscing at the dining table, a pack of feral children stealing food. It's not divided by men and women, a little age but you're welcome to sit in with any group and participate as much as you want. OP might have enjoyed sitting in the kitchen with the women but it sounds like she wasn't comfortable enough to go alone, she should have asked bf to join her for a bit and introduce her.", "As someone who grew up in this kind of lifestyle, the women would've told OP's boyfriend to get out of what was already a crowded kitchen.", "What I\u2019m saying is, there\u2019s not really anything he could have done at that moment to help her out. The people chatting were in the kitchen and she decided not to join them.", "Obviously no one wants kids to be bored during thanksgiving, but the women can\u2019t be the only ones responsible for the children just because of the atmosphere.

Italian-American family here and same. Mostly women in the kitchen/dining room, mostly men in the living room. Totally cool to rotate if you want, also totally cool to set up shop in one or the other all day regardless of gender. I (female) tend to find the kitchen more fun, my husband (who graciously married into our crazy) spends more time in the living room.\n\nI've never seen it as sexist or weird though. Just that women tend to relate better with other women and same for men. It's not like anyone actually forced OP into the kitchen or anything.", "I especially don't enjoy standing around in a kitchen full of people I don't know. I'm terribly shy and can't make small talk to save my life, so I just don't say anything until I'm ready to burst with tears. This entire scenario is some people's nightmare.", "Did they prohibit her from watching the game?", "It doesn\u2019t sound as though anyone had a problem with her hanging out in the living room, though? If she had been interested in football, I doubt anyone would have batted an eye. It sounds like she was obviously NOT into football, and no one batted an eye. The dynamic might be gendered, and that might be worth examining, but no one asked her to set the table or help with cooking. That would be a problem with his family. \n\nIf I were in that situation, I\u2019d be angry at my boyfriend for throwing me into his family dinner with no introduction or help getting to know them. I\u2019d bet she would have felt just as abandoned if there had been mixed genders in both rooms. He walked into the house, grabbed a beer, and told her to fend for herself for the rest of the day. She\u2019s focusing on his family dynamic, but he\u2019s the only one who behaved rudely (according to the post.)", "She might not want that information about a misogynist she\u2019ll most likely be dumping.

Gender roles aside, OP was expected to mix with people she had either barely or never met.  In that scenario, I would want my bf to stay with me for at least part of the time to make me comfortable, rather than being with strangers.", "So we should high-five the family for not telling her she was unwelcome watching football? The point is she wasn\u2019t told in advance about any of this and why should she have to spend the holiday quietly sitting down watching a sport that the gf said she wasn\u2019t really interested in?

There's no indication that the women in this story were anything but happy with the arrangement", "Yes. Because I doubt that 15 people preparing food is that big of a task that they would all boycott, no notice, without any type of adult conversation. \n\nI, personally, enjoy food prep, especially if I can snack, watch Christmas movies and converse with other women. So, even.if all the \"menfolk\" are watching football myself and quite a few other women will continue cooking because, you know, we enjoy it.", "Sounds like there was a TV set up in the kitchen, since OP mentions Christmas movies playing. It doesn't sound like anyone was forced or excluded, so I'm leaning NAH", "Yes. Usually women do the cooking in my house but when we are more social the men pick up the slack.", "because the person she knows is her boyfriend, most likely and probably felt a bit anxious to separate from him.", "Yes!", "I can see your point. And I think I forget that like\u2026 I\u2019ve known my in laws for almost 10 years, and I probably have forgotten the anxiety of thanksgiving with your SO if it\u2019s the first or second time. In that case, he should have tried to mingle with her more- went in to the kitchen to get conversation started maybe and then frequently checked in on her and the gals or talked to her more during the game and tried getting her involved in conversation with the guys. \n\nBut yes, she also could have done more to make the best of the situation.", "Personally, I enjoy some separation time from my husband at gatherings. I love the man, but I live with him lol I see him all the time. It\u2019s nice to have some breathing room.Typically, he goes and plays with the kids/nephews with his brother and they catch up, and I chat in the kitchen and talk with my SIL and MIL. I enjoy this dynamic, and we all come back together for dinner and then usually separate again.

Have them play in the same room so they can watch the game and still keep an eye on them? Wild.", "Yes. IF they want to. It doesn't seem like this family wanted to. There was absolutely nothing stopping the women from \"chilling\" in the living room. Other than them enjoying the kitchen atmosphere more. \n\nThe only person complaining is OP. Who went into the living room.", "This may be true for most people, but since OP's BF verbatim told her that the men sitting and watching football, drinking beer while the women go in the kitchen to cook and talk was their tradition, I still think they're sexist. \n\nFrankly I'd be disappointed just because he said they make a whole day of it, which to me makes it seem like they do stuff OTHER than food prep for Thanksgiving fun while they have the whole family around, like games and stuff.", "I would agree with you but ONLY the women were in the kitchen and hey BF basically told her that's where she should go.", "I used to think it was so weird that a lot of people play board games or party games at family holidays. But now I understand that that\u2019s because a multigenerational family is often a group of people without many shared interests.

They\u2019re just pointing out that she could\u2019ve learned a lot. The women were welcoming and warm to her and she chose to go into the other room where they were already watching football. That\u2019s like walking up to a group of people playing cornhole and horseshoes and then complaining that you don\u2019t like yard games. Like wtf. They were already doing that thing before you got there. We\u2019re they supposed to turn the games off? That would\u2019ve made it even more awkward.

Pick one", "If they were misogynistic they wouldn't have let her stay with the men and watch the game.", "I wish I had an award to give for this.", "Yup. It was on OP's boyfriend to hangout with her in the kitchen area and help her integrate better with the family. Instead, he chose to be selfish and watch the match.", "Then she could've chatted up the women who warmly invited her to join them and offered her a drink.", "Except.... no one said she had to cook or help cook.

I love being a girl and just so happen to love cooking so everyone comes to chill with me in the kitchen \ud83d\ude0a She chose to be miserable because gawd forbid she would have to set foot in a kitchen to enjoy herself. \nY'all are seriously missing out on so much fun in life by always trying to be mightier than thou.\n\nIf the ladies were hanging in the living room instead of the kitchen, would she have still hollered misogyny?", "Nowhere was it stated she was expected to help\n\nYou're making up your own additions", "So the men could just as easily have watched football in the kitchen and cooked while they did so, while women sat and watched movies until the meal was ready. And yet, I would bet money they would never agree to that. It doesn't have to be \"forced\" to make it a stupid \"tradition\".", "Yes there is\u2026.. it would not be cooked.  And the women would be blamed for it.  This \u201ctradition\u201d goes back at least 3 generations possibly 4 depending on how old OP is - since football games were televised  in the 1950\u2019s.", "Then grow the fuck up.

I don\u2019t know how some of these people get through the first day of work at a new job.", "She said she\u2019d met the bf\u2019s mom and sister a few times before so that\u2019s not true.", "Yeah, I've been warned that the groups for the Thanksgiving I'm going to tomorrow (haven't seen this part of the family in 9 years) breaks apart into the heavy drinkers and thise who don't. So yay.... \n\nBut yeah, everyone breaks up into their \"groups\" because of like interests. Most of these groups will slowly merge and break apart.", "I never saw the shed this way before. I might latch onto this.", "Aye, but there\u2019s no space at all in the bf\u2019s family\u2019s setup for anything else. There\u2019s no flexibility, no diversity. It\u2019s one way or nothing at all. No place for women who don\u2019t want to muck about with children, or only cook and hang with other women all day. Seriously\u2014six hours or or of strange women\u2019s small talk and no connection with the person who brought me? I\u2019d be so bored.", "Me too.", "This. OP WAS out with the guys watching the game.

Nobody was forcing her to do anything.", "Sure it may have had you bow out due to sensory overload, but what the commenter you are replying to is saying is that  op never said that was an issue. their only cited issue was that it was sexist.", "Do you know if OP was experiencing sensory overload??

If *that* had happened, I'd be with you. Oh heck no, we are gonna have a convo.\n\nHe just said that is where the people who talk hang out and talk up a storm when she said she was feeling uncomfortable (that's not on the table here though, which is unfortunate).\n\nShe said in another comment that there were women who weren't doing food prep that were just hanging out and chatting. \n\nSo...just hang out and talk with people who actually want to talk and be social? I think it's the locations that is the the problem which happens to be broken out along 1950s white middle class gender systems.", "And so was this family. No one objected to OP going to the living room and hanging out with the men.", "Jesus Christ this has to be a Guinness world record for reaching. You got all that from her being nice to OP?", "I disagree that it is sexist. I see it as how this family just splits apart. No one was forced or coerced one way or another. Saying \"men can't watch football\" is sexist. If THAT family I'd happy with how.it is, then it is NOT wrong.", "Fair enough.", "Families can do as they please", "I think it was a poor choice of words on his part. Because if the tradition was for men to watch football and women to stay in the kitchen than they w weouldn't have let her in the living room when she tried or the other women would have stopped her from leaving the kitchen. I don't think the tradition is \"MEN in the living room and WOMEN in the kitchen\" I think it's \"FOOTBALL in the living room and TALKING in the kitchen\". Does that make sesne? It's just that up until not all the men chose the living room and all the women chose the kitchen. (Technically this is still the case. OP wanted to talk. But for some reason she wanted to talk in the football watching room.) \n\nCooking and watching football IS a whole day of fun for some people. My fianc\u00e9's favorite thing is to sit on the couch and watch football. *I* don't get it, but it makes him happy. I, on the other hand, would love to spend the whole day cooking and talking. So I don't think it was strange that the boyfriend described it as\"making a whole day out of it\". It is a whole day of fun for them. I think it's completely find that OP isn't loving this situation. Some people are just too different in all the wrong ways. Nothing wrong with that. But I also don't think everyone else is an AH for being okay with their Thanksgiving arrangements. \n\nI do think it would have been nice of the BF to stay with her in the kitchen for a few minutes until she got acclimated with everyone.", "I mean he was right. She didn't want to watch football so she would have been happier in the kitchen where there was no football. And I guess no other women wanted to watch it either. And I guess none of the guys wanted to cook or talk. That's all okay. It's okay to conform to stereotypical gender norms if that's what makes you happy. It's also okay for OP to not like it. But it's not okay for OP to think other people should stop doing what makes them happy because it doesn't make her happy. I'm not sure if I explained that well or not.", "I agree with you.", "But the family is not *him*. That\u2019s getting to know the relatives \u2014 not interrogating them about his past which is what the comment suggested. All their examples revolved around him when she probably already knows her bf and was more interested in the others. \n\nYes; she could\u2019ve sucked it up in order to accomplish her goal but she was stuck between a rock and a hard place. Either she: 1) performs obligatory traditionally female labor in order to \u201cget to know the family\u201d \u2014 which would just have been the women or 2) avoids the labor she does not enjoy to hang out w/ her bf but he\u2019s gonna ignore her to be one of the guys. There\u2019s no winning for OP.", "She did.", "Fixed a plate and went back to the TV, she said. If the women sat at a table I hope OP at least joined them then.", "Getting your own plate is the literal least amount of effort the men could have put forth lol. To act like cooking and preparing the entire meal isn't \"serving\" people because the men were able to tear themselves away from the TV for 30 seconds is laughable. \n\nWho do you think was responsible for cleaning everything up? Hint: I'll bet it wasn't the men.", "It stupid too you, doesn't make it stupid for everyone. Stop FORCING your values on others.", "So basically taking the people that are happy to cook and replacing them by the people who would no be?", "Maybe the women like doing it? There\u2019s a similar arrangement in my family because while both parties enjoy cooking, the women insist on it. Don\u2019t know what OP expected. If you don\u2019t like watching football and don\u2019t like hanging out in the kitchen, then go home.", "Everybody's mad about men not cooking. I would roll over and die before eating anything the men in my family cooked.", "Bingo.", "We don't know how old she is. It could be her first time being an in law. We don't know her personal life, whether she's prone to social anxiety or not. His family sounds massive and some people don't do well in large groups of strangers.", "Doesn't mean they're close or she feels comfortable with the. there was about 15 of them as well, ans they know each other well as family. She came with her boyfriend, and the mum and the sister probably wouldn't have been solely socialising with her so she'd be left on her own a bit. Sounds intimidating to me!", "Sure can. Even if that means upholding ridiculous family traditions where all the responsibilities fall upon the women of the family.", "Man I would be SOL at your Thanksgiving. I hate football AND cooking. This makes me feel like there should be some sort of disclosure or something. Like \"hey, two options for tomorrow. Hopefully you like one of them\"", "This is the perfect explanation! If they would have chased her out for being a woman folk, then it would have been an issue. But she was doing the wrong activity in the wrong room. The BF should have made sure she felt comfortable in an unfamiliar place instead of just assuming OP could dive right in and start acting like old friends with everyone was shitty of him. HE is comfortable there so he may have forgotten SHE wasn't comfortable there and totally innocently too. Personally, I can start up conversations with just about anyone and I rarely meet a stranger. 2 of my 3 kiddos are the same. My husband and our oldest are the opposite. They are not totally hopeless and awkward, but they are not randomly making friends in public like the rest of us are either. OP sounds like my husband and oldest. The boyfriend needs to be a good person and help her out with introductions.", "So then she shouldn't whine.  She wasn't banned from hanging out with the guys. She just didn't like what their event had.", "Idk if it was just op\u2019s word choice but she said most, not all of the women were doing food prep, idk if it was actually expected of her to help out in the kitchen or she was just welcome to join them and hang out.", "That's called weaponized incompetence.", "Sometimes things are between the lines", "I\u2019m prone to social anxiety, I had to integrate into a large loud family. Was it my favorite thing ever? No. Did I do it because I knew it was important to my SO? Yes. Have a drink, talk, and try to be normal.", "Sounds like she expected for everyone\u2019s attention to be on her or for everyone to reach out to her when it goes both ways? And also yeah they wouldn\u2019t have just been focused on her because thanksgiving is about spending time with family and friends\u2026 there\u2019s probably people they haven\u2019t seen in a long time and they wouldn\u2019t be wrong for interacting with everyone. The mom and sister were being welcoming and OP decided she\u2019d rather sit with all the men watching a football game that she wasn\u2019t interested in, while complaining that it was awkward. It seems the men weren\u2019t talking to her and her bf was paying attention to the game, so why didn\u2019t she just go socialize with people that were actually talking and socializing?", "Hahahaha! I mean we try to be good hosts, you wouldn't be forced to do either! Do you like to read or crochet? I do those things too. \ud83d\ude02 My fianc\u00e9...uhh...yeah no he just watches sports. Hahaha! I think a lot of families are different and you just kind of know that in life. I don't really expect other families to be just like mine. I think it's only an issue when you're dating/thinking about marrying into said family. Like I can be bored for a few hours at a friends house. But marry into that? Ehh no.", "Definitely think it could have been an innocent mistake on the boyfriend's part. OP's boyfriend and you sound a lot like my fianc\u00e9. He never meets a stranger and had no problem chatting with anyone and everyone. I am soooo socially awkward and always anxious in social situations. So it was really hard for me when we first started dating and his family would throw these big parties all the time. And he knew and loved these people so it never occurred to him that I might feel awkward. Thankfully his mom picked up on it and helped me. (God I miss that women. I hit the MIL jackpot with her.) Granted, he was only 19 (I was 17). But I can still see how even an adult might not pick up on it. Especially if they're naturally just social AND around people they already know and are comfortable with.", "The ladies have to make the meal while the dudes just get to hang out and drink beer. Women are expected to hang out in the kitchen? What is this? The 1940s? Cmon.", "Sometimes, yeah, but this isn't one of those times.", "Yes but people do what is more comfortable to them in difficult situations. That would be staying near their SO. That's the done thing if you're a +1.", "Yeah you are right. I feel she felt out of her depth in both situations (with her boyfriend but felt awkward) and with a lot of people she didn't know and misinterpreted this discomfort as her being uncomfortable because its misogynistic. But her feeling banished is probably from her feeling abandoned by her boyfriend, with the added layer of possibly looking after the kids and cooking the dinner.", "I think people always go into things assuming that there is malice and/or a set up in everything instead of the actual innocence of the situation. Because I will just go and chat to people, especially cute little kids because I wanted to be a Speech Language Pathological, even got as far as finishing my first semester of grad school before my physical disabilities put the brakes on that. We also got married young, 19 and 18 and are 37 and 36 now and he knows to just let me kinda go off and socialize for a bit lol. If OP feels like the situation is sexist, then maybe that is how she is viewing it, but I think if she looks at it through our lens, it may change her view. Not men vs women, but talking vs football.", "Then sit there and watch football even if you don\u2019t like it and not bitch about it.

Tell the women to come in and watch football? While it is pretty sexist, it\u2019s what these people have been doing (seemingly happy) for years. If you didn\u2019t like it, don\u2019t go next year. Also, they let you watch the football game with them, they didn\u2019t banish you to the kitchen! The two activities were: watch movies and cook or watch football. Sorry you were bored.", "C- minus.

She clearly didn\u2019t want to watch football and she clearly didn\u2019t want to be in the kitchen. If everyone is having a good time, don\u2019t see this as sexiest or misogynistic. Nobody was forcing her to be somewhere specific. People need to chill out on on all this crap. Sounds to me like she didn\u2019t like the family dynamics and made a stance. She was invited to hang out, chose where she wanted to interact even though she didn\u2019t know anything about football or even like it. Nobody banished her anywhere and she\u2019s not entitled to people entertaining her so she can satisfy her views on family dynamics. \n\nYTA", "YTA \"Banished to the kitchen\"  no.

Also, if you weren\u2019t a fan of football you shoulda tried to bond with the women, they seemed accepting.

You had two options: sit with the men and watch football, or join the women in the kitchen. Women are allowed to enjoy traditionally feminine things. Men are allowed to enjoy traditionally masculine things. Both are allowed to enjoy things that are not traditionally prescribed to them. You didn\u2019t want to do either. You were a bad guest. Get over yourself. People like you give real feminists a bad name. Not everything is a social justice issue. You sound insufferable.", "ESH - yeah so it\u2019s a shitty tradition, and they should have included you more, but this is really not uncommon.  His female family sounded lovely, you should have just gone, talked to them and chilled.  Yeah you don\u2019t want to be relegated to the kitchen, but those women are there because they don\u2019t like sports.

No one had an issue with you just sitting and watching with them, and maybe all the women in the family just enjoy cooking for thanksgiving. \n\nFrom the sounds of how you described them, I doubt the women would have had any issues with men coming to help and cook either, it\u2019s just what they choose to do. At my celebration, it\u2019s actually mostly the men who cook and I\u2019m the only woman that helps. At my bf\u2019s house, his mom is the only one that really cooks, but only because she likes things done a certain way and enjoys doing it.\n\nI feel like you should\u2019ve talked more to the women there about how they felt about it before making any assumptions.", "YTA. You said you didn\u2019t like football, obviously the men do and obviously the women don\u2019t or they would be in there watching it as well. You were invited to hang out with the women.

Get used to it or move on.", "This was every Thanksgiving in my family until I left home.  The only difference is that my aunts, female cousins, grandmother and mother all sniped at each other while the meal was being prepped. I always hated Thanksgiving. But I'm 64.

I am an introvert and generally reserved with people I don't know well so.just the thought of going from 10am until whenever in a house full of people I've never met would be a big NOPE for me. Add in the choice of watching football or being stuck in the kitchen with a pack of women gossiping/cooking and I would opt for a root canal.", "I mean, she wasn\u2019t shunned from watching the game when she initially went and sat down. The ones cooking apparently have no interest in the game. She admits she didnt eitherand wanted to yap through it. I think the men could stand to help cook while having the game on the kitchen but there\u2019s no definitive indication they wouldn\u2019t help cook. OP wants to have her bf full attention and is pissed he\u2019s watching football. We used to deal with this every superbowl. Most of us were into the game and would therefore cook ahead of time or during breaks and we had a few friends we couldn\u2019t not invite but who would show up and yip yap all through the game as though everyone was as disinterested as them.", "Leaving aside the problematic gender divide...\n\nWhen you bring a plus one to a gathering where you know everyone and they know noone, it's rude and isolating to join in a silent, non-interactive activity (like watching sports, playing video games, sitting around reading books) and expect your plus one to fly solo and meet strangers on their own. That's not what a good host does. \n\nImagine that there was a pretty even mix of men/women watching football, and in the kitchen. Knowing your gf doesn't enjoy football and knows no one else at the party, it's pretty rude to go silently watch football and give her the options to sit there awkwardly watching you watch football, or venture out alone with strangers when they are supposed to be your guest.", "Eh. Join them to chat, sure. But I\u2019d never ask a guest to cook for my family. That\u2019s just wtf.", "I don't agree with this entirely. Sure, OP was introduced to some family members, but common sense would dictate that since she didn't know mom/sister well, BF can't just dump her with them. There's a great relationship psychology book called \"Wired for Love\" that talks about the importance of making sure your partner feels safe and socially comfortable in social situations to which you've brought them along. BF didn't do this. You can't just dump your partner with people they barely know, and expect them to get along fine because they're all the same gender.", "The men didn't even care she joined them but she insisted on people intensively watching football talk to her about something else that interested her. \n\nOther things OP likes to do includes going into movie theaters and loudly gossiping.", "I completely agree with YTA. I can't believe how many people are saying otherwise. How rude of her to show up as a guest and demand everyone else do something differently because she doesn't like either option. Had they forced her to cook, then she could have a point.  She had the option to hang out with the ladies and watch Hallmark movies or watch football with her BF. A lot of guys like to watch football on Thanskgiving and many women prefer cooking on Thanksiving. I personally would prefer to cook with the football game playing in the kitchen, but I'll never turn down a Hallmark Christmas movie either! OP was incredibly rude and I doubt she will be invited back.

Now he knew I wasn\u2019t about that kinda life so you know what he did? He got up and started to help me set the table together. His grandmother was trying to get him to sit down but he helped me until everything was set and he continued to do this every single time we went and got dinner. A couple of the other husbands started to get the message and eventually started helping out.

Given that his family tradition would make this very difficult, his other option was to admit to his gf that he didn't think things through, and even though he had originally assumed he could mindlessly drink beer and watch football all day, since he had invited a guest it really behooved him to find some way they could both enjoy the day.  Maybe takeout Chinese food at home?", "I think he assumed she would be a good girl and do as she was told.  He could have taken his ass to the kitchen and showed the guys a different option.", "Idk. Engage with her somehow.

It's just that what you got to know was, well, THAT. You learned they aren't a good fit for what you want for yourself.\n\nI don't like all the \"but this is how they are!\" responses. Their \"traditions\" are misogynistic, your boyfriend didn't have your back and listen when you brought it up, and really, what are the odds any of this will ever change?\n\nWhatever their traditions are, it doesn't matter because you were so uncomfortable. Think long and hard about what you're signing up for.", "Well, you DID get to know his family. You learned that his family has extremely strong gender roles, and that the men don't even join in on the Thanksgiving dinner that takes hours to prepare but instead eat it in front of the tv. You also learned that your boyfriend sees absolutely nothing wrong with this dynamic.", "Gotcha. There's some weirdness here:\n\n- having Thanksgiving dinner on a TV tray while watching football is disrespectful to the people that made it.\n- you boyfriend saying that you 'overreacted'. Maybe he meant 'you misread the situation', but he needs to communicate that better. Or maybe I'm being too generous towards him and he was really trying to dismiss your feelings.\n- what sounded like banishing into the kitchen. I'd understand if my wife wasn't comfortable just being thrown into a social situation with a bunch of strangers. But my response wouldn't be \"Go away, men are relaxing here\"\n\nYour boyfriend's handling of the situation sucks, and he's an asshole for sure.\n\nI don't agree with the people telling you that you should have just gone and hung out in the kitchen. I have social anxiety, and hate being thrown to the rest of the family, no matter how friendly and well intentioned it was.\n\nMy judgement is that: If this was a social anxiety thing where you just weren't comfortable hanging out with a bunch of people you didn't know, then you're in the clear. Same if they were just looking to put you to work for them. Otherwise, I think you were a bit rude to his mother / sister who were trying to include you, and you missed an opportunity to get to know his family better.", "Oh come on, you know what happened. They continued to watch football and waited for the pie to be brought to them.", "So maybe you should\u2019ve stayed and see what happens?

If no one\u2019s making a fuss about it then, unless you yourself plan on making the fuss, don\u2019t be upset when no fuss is made?\n\nBasically it sounds like upon hearing the women happily being in the kitchen and watching the kids, you, without asking those women what their opinions and thought were on it or if the men will help clean up later or basically anything about this, decided yourself to be offended on their behalf because \u201cWOMEN???

In this culture, roles are very gendered and you visit on a holiday. The men sit around the fire outside playing card games/socializing/etc. your friend introduces you to the matriarch who invites you to join the women in the kitchen preparing meals. Personally, you don\u2019t spend your holidays cooking meals. But, would you shun her family\u2019s tradition, outcast yourself and risk offending them after they\u2019ve excitedly welcomed you to their home? Or would you go along with it for the day bc while you know you will never live like this after you get home, you would like a chance for a new experience, to meet nice new people, explore a new culture and deepen your relationship with your friend before returning to your regular life? You\u2019d be an inflexible AH to consider doing the former, that\u2019s just not the right way to do life. Now translate this to this one day with your boyfriends seemingly nice family. To prove a point, you forewent a chance for an interesting afternoon with nice new ppl that your bf loves. There were only 2 things going on, football and food. You were welcome to join either. It\u2019s not really his fault you didn\u2019t like the options and didn\u2019t want to try to go with the flow. Almost all couples have some story of being confronted by something new and challenging when joining a family, and how they navigate those moments often influences the outcome of those relationships.

My own choice in the past---when I've been with a guy where socializing is like this---is to get through the event as best I can, but avoid socializing with that group in the future. My explanation has been that when I'm with you, I want to be with you, not a bunch of women. \n\nI have also made it clear that it's totally okay with me for BF to go to events like that in his own.

My mom, aunt (T's MIL) and I (f) had a marvelous time in the kitchen. The food was all cooked, (major, wonderful potluck!) so we were just doing last bits of arranging, reheating in the oven.  None of us watched sports at Xmas/Thanksgiving in our family. We wandered around, conversing, lending a hand, setting the table, men too.  My uncle, a professional butcher & good cook, was in charge of carving the turkey. Afterwards, all we young folks, both genders, including my husband, brother and male cousins, pitched in to store leftovers, repack cookies, clear the table, load dishwasher, (and the guys also washed the heavy pots),  take out the garbage. Except Terri, who just sat and watched everyone. It was very strange.   \n\n\nNow, my dad was fairly useless, in a kitchen. But other male persons knew how to do their part, and you better believe that the women had explained this, and they already knew. We didn't want Terri to do drudge work, just be part of the family, working/helping with all the others, as part of our community effort. It was getting to the point where we all were taking pressure off the senior women, my mom and my aunt (Terri's MIL). Sorry for over sharing here. My two traditional Southern families shared the load, even between genders. A guest should never be abandoned, as OP was.", "Okay. I have some thoughts here\u2026\n\n>He said they make a whole day of it, so we would be heading over around 10am.\n\nSo clearly this was going to be a whole day affair \u2014even if the family eats their traditional meal around lunchtime that is still several hours at least \u2014not to mention the fact that OP clearly stated that everyone ate and continued to hang out. BF should have definitely explained to OP what to expect.\n\n>When we arrived there were several men sitting in the livingroom watching football.\n\n>There is a cooler in the middle of the room and my bf grabs a beer and sits down to watch the game. \n\nSo, tv and beer \u2014not a female in sight here.\n\n>His mom and sister come in to say \"hi\" and his mom says \"perfect timing! We are just getting going in the kitchen! Come on let's get you a drink!\"\n\nBy stating \u201cwe are just getting going in the kitchen\u201d, it is clear that mom is trying to usher OP into the kitchen to stay. This tradition has been normalized for years in their family. They literally don\u2019t know any other way. The women were clearly being friendly and polite. However, just because they are happy in this misogynistic dynamic doesn\u2019t mean that OP has to be okay with it too \u2014and just because the other females were being nice to her doesn\u2019t mean that OP should feel obligated to bend to their sexist tradition and stay in the kitchen. Staying with the other women in the kitchen \u2014regardless of how nice and fun the other women were \u2014would have allowed herself to be treated in a sexist manner. \n\nLet\u2019s not fool ourselves. Men are not the only people who encourage misogyny. Women do it too. Many of you are doing it when you tell OP she should have just \u201cgone into the kitchen and talked about it later with the bf\u201d. Ladies, when you just \u201cwalk into the kitchen\u201d in a scenario like this, you have just encouraged misogyny to continue \u2014and you are the target!

The family tradition is for the guys to watch football and the ladies hang out in the kitchen and make the meal.\"\n\nSo, clearly the family expectation is that the women stay in the kitchen and make the meal. I mean, OP stated that clearly. I don\u2019t know why so many people seem to be confused about this.\n\n>I ended up just sitting around awkwardly watching them all talk\n\nSo, clearly all of the men were talking. They simply didn\u2019t care to talk to their guest. I know several families that would have done this for different reasons. \n\n1) It\u2019s possible that they were just rude. I don\u2019t know any families that group-watch sports in silence. If you are already talking amongst yourselves, you can talk to your guest a bit and get to know them.\n\n2) It is definitely possible that they were being petty about the fact that OP wasn\u2019t in the kitchen. I have actually experienced this type of behavior so it\u2019s not outside the realm of likely possibilities. \n\nEither way, the men were being rude \u2014and the BF tried to make it OP\u2019s fault by pointing out that if she \u201cdidn\u2019t like it\u201d she had the kitchen option.\n\nSo\u2026 NTA. OP, you were thrown into an awkward, all-day, situation without warning. You were basically given the choices to either sit around with people that wouldn\u2019t talk to you (BF included) and watch something that doesn\u2019t entertain you or demonstrate compliance to sexism by going into the kitchen. I feel like sitting in the living room was your only choice. \n\nYour boyfriend made it clear that he was okay with this family \u201ctradition\u201d. You are clearly not.

Like, yeah, there aren\u2019t many options, but you\u2019re a guest and he should have at least introduced you, made an effort to make you more comfortable, given you a fidget toy or something. \n\nOverall, holidays are generally\u2026what\u2019s the word\u2026traditionalist.

I wanted to hear the juicy stories and be helping cook. Everyone is acting like these women are second class citizens, but in actuality they are the heartbeat of the holidays. A lot of them probably don't get to see each other often and that is their time to catch up, gripe about the men, laugh, gossip, and just enjoy the company.

What happens when you\u2019re instantly outvoted? I say this because I\u2019ve been in group situations like this where neither of the options available appeal to ME personally.

Would you like it if someone chattered through a movie you really wanted to watch?", "Exactly. As women we are taught by society that our role is to please others and meet others needs, and that we should get validation from this rather than from things which meet our individual needs (like men). So even if on the surface it seems like 'all the women prefer making a massive meal that's loads of work' over chilling out watching the game, it's very possible that some of us (not all) only enjoy this or think we do as it helps us fulfil our role of pleasing others and meeting their needs, which is how many (not all) women now in adulthood were raised as young girls. For example, when I worked in a nursery (around 15 years ago) all the stories about boys were about bravery, individual achievement and adventure, and the stories centring girls were more often about being kind, helping others and being a 'good' (ie socially palatable and useful) person. This has changed a lot over recent years thankfully but that kind of conditioning can get very ingrained.", "As I understand this ritual, it is a bonding ritual amongst the women. They are free to talk to other women who more than likely know all the members of each other's families and they can talk freely while they cook and clean up.

The man on the other hand I'm not sure what it is they do except quietly watch football until it's time to jump up because their wide receiver missed the catch and lost the game.", "\"No one is *really* talking to me\"\n\nIn other words they're not talking about the topics that interest her.\n\nShe's not the center of the universe.", "That could have happened without any sugar.

If OP had maybe spent some time in the kitchen, immersing herself in what was actually going on in there, she might have been less bored. The immediate assumption that \"women in the kitchen\" equates to some sort of servitude situation is odd. \n\nUltimately, though, OP was deserved some attention as her boyfriend's guest. He invited her, he's responsible for making her feel welcomed and comfortable.", "She was & she did.

I understand being bored by football; I\u2019m not into it either and where I\u2019m from in the U.S., football is a *huge* deal-particularly college football. But even though I don\u2019t care for it and have never sat down and watched an entire game, I\u2019ve still witnessed enough instances where *others* were watching it and I\u2019ve been capable of reading the room and figuring out that people who are enthralled by a football game aren\u2019t really available to engage in conversation with. I don\u2019t take *offense* to it because that\u2019s ridiculous; it\u2019s just how it is. I\u2019m sure that OP has things that *she* loves to watch that she\u2019d not want to stop concentrating on for the sake of everyday conversation. \n\nThough I will say that it was a bit excessive for the men to get their meal and eat it in front of the tv. At all of the holiday celebrations I\u2019ve been to, football was watched either before dinner, after dinner, or both-but never *during*. Meals were always a group affair where everyone in attendance sat down at the same time at a table or a group of tables.

The men don't want her either it seems. \n\nThis family will not ever change to make everyone contribute.", "It's fine if they like it. \n\nThe key factor is, if anyone is (low key) pressured into a role (due to gender). \n\nIs it an offer to either hang out in the kitchen with movies (cooking optional), or watching football? Or is it implied if she's hanging out in the kitchen she needs to cook and since she's a women it's expected that she stays in the kitchen. \n\nThat's an important distinction. \n\nIf most of the women in the family simply have a passion for cooking and love to get together and make something great, that's great, if it works for them. But men should be invited to hang out in the kitchen and help too and vice versa. \n\nAlso, what happens if you choose to not participate in these roles? OP was basically grey rocked by the men. Will the women now shun her because she didn't help?  \n\nI'm not American so no Thanksgiving for me, but with my partner if my family hosts, I assist with small prep work or serving or cleanup or whatever. If it's his family event he takes that role and supports his family or makes a dish to bring.

When it was clear that she was going to watch football, why weren't his family trying to get to know her? She is the new one which can be very uncomfortable since you don't know all the social norms, so they, who are in the group, should take the initiativ. If they don't you are spending your whole day feeling like the elephant in the room. Her boyfriend could have done so much more to \"bridge the gap\" between his girlfriend and family.

You still try.", "He could\u2019ve hung out with her instead of just doing his own thing. He could\u2019ve gone into the kitchen and hung out with her a bit so that she\u2019d warm up to the ladies.

And maybe if he did that who knows, maybe she would\u2019ve felt more comfortable around the women and hung out with them and the bf could\u2019ve gone back to watching football.\n\nMeeting your partners family for the first time is always daunting and it sounds like the bf just dropped her off and was like ok, figure it out.", "Fair. You cook, you don\u2019t clean.", "I feel like this might be OP's situation to some extent. Like, the first time she complained about not liking football, coukd the BF not have gone to the kitchen a bit to get things going there, or even started a 3rd gender neutral activity like a game of cards ir something? Once OP is comfortable with other people, he can go back to football.\n\nThe worst part of this whole story is that they apparently don't even sit at the table for the meal. So there was no point where OP could hang out with her BF without the game on.", "I totally get this. I'm neurotypical but being in a hot kitchen that's noisy, full of people I've never met and have to spend the entire day with, and a bunch of kids running about sounds like hell on earth.

It's sad that anyone would settle for a life of being treated like less because of their gender.", "its very telling that you assume the women will be gossiping", "Yeah, I'm really digging all the 'enlightened anti sexists that don't need feminism anymore' acting like this isn't sexist and isn't part of an older, grander tradition of sexism.", "They could have put on those movies in living room. Then the kids would not bother women who were doing work and men could have look after them.", "Well put.", "This, yeah. I get not wanting to do kitchen duty just because she\u2019s a woman. But sitting with the men watching a game she has no interest in seems like cutting off your nose to spite your face.", "And I think the idea being threaded between these comments is that it's sexist that the women's side is responsible for kids and cooking and the men's side isn't responsible for anything.", "I wonder if next year the men will watch football in the kitchen while doing food prep and the women will watch Christmas films in the living room.", "Because it's almost 2023 and not 1950. This gendered, misogynistic bullshit should be more extinct than the Dodo bird by now.\n\nAlso her BF is an asshole for just walking her into the house and then dumping her on a bunch of strangers.

Now leave me alone while I ignore you and drink.", "Agreed!\n\n Usually the first thing we \"womenfolk\" in my social circle chat about is work, careers. The usual pleasantries/greetings how's your family, how's the weather, then we talk work or some topical subjects. But the prevailing idea when one uses the word gossip is diminutive in nature. No, our entire gender is not a 1950's sitcom but this thread is turning into one.", "What is this sexist nonsense?

Men talk constantly during those games.", "I\u2019m not really a sports fan, but every time I\u2019ve been to a Super Bowl party, everyone always talks during the game.

This would suck even if it wasn't Thanksgiving.", "THIS. I get that she always had the option to leave the livingroom and talk to people in the kitchen, but when a partner is introducing their significant other to their family (but what is essentially a group of strangers to the partner) it is on the partner to facilitate that introduction. \n\nThere was no reason he couldn't have 1. Had conversations with his SO while they watched football, or 2. Hung out in the kitchen with her and the more talkative group. That is what a supportive partner would have done.", "See, I wouldn't necessarily have thought of it as being stuck in the kitchen. Every good party centers around the kitchen.

Those who didn\u2019t were in the kitchen drinking, talking, some watching tv and some but not all were cooking.  The mother and sister both warmly greeted you and invited you to join them.  That would have been a good time for you to get to know some of the other family members.  I\u2019m not sure what you expected your boyfriend to do because this seems like this \u201ctradition\u201d has been established and unlikely to change without pushback.  Ask yourself, if he had told you in advance what Thanksgiving was like with his family, would you have still attended?", "Lord almighty anyone who goes to your SOs family gathering and expects it\u2019s going to be a whole lot of time with your SO is just clueless.", "Also considering she thought she would be spending the day WITH her bf and he literally spent the entire day ignoring her watching football, yikes", "You are completely ignoring the fact that she is more or less a captive audience. He probably watches football all the time. No mention of her complaining in the past; why? Because she can do her own thing. She's not trapped at someone elses house.\n\nThis is like going to any party with a friend where you don't know anyone there. Then your one friend basically goes off and ignores you. It's going to suck, and your friend sucks for bailing on you. It's worse because they are a couple.\n\nShe doesn't want to control the situation, she just doesn't want to be miserable.", "When she told him she felt awkward and uncomfortable and not able to fit in anywhere that was his cue to stop watching tv and chat with her for an hour. To get up and go into the kitchen with her and participate in a conversation in there with her and his family. To take her for a walk or anything. \n\nHe insisted they come and spend a full whole day here, it was his job to host her at this event and instead he ignored when she wasn\u2019t having a good time and stayed glued to the tv.", "YTA its his family's tradition....alright the women cook the men watch football, no one yelled at you for watching the game so it's not like \"no girls allowed\" you made yourself feel uncomfortable, they were obviously watching the game no one ones to chit-chat you wanted to talk he said go in the kitchen...his family...his \"traditions\"....ya did it to yourself....\n\nI'm sure I'm gonna get downvoted beyond oblivion, I'm not saying women HAVE to cook and men HAVE to watch football. You just made a way bigger deal than need be. Meeting families for rhe first time is always awkward. Put in a little effort FFS crawl out of your boyfriends ass.... \n\nHe could have made a little effort on your end though too...sooo", "Ehhh, ESA but leaning more towards YTA. \n\nThanksgiving is a family holiday, you went to your boyfriends family's thanksgiving, where presumably they will carry out their family tradition. \n\nShould your boyfriend have told you beforehand? Maybe. \n\nI've never once told my husband what my holidays consisted of other than food, unless I had to actually warn him about something. (my family has a lot of health problems that have made some holidays... interesting) \n\nNot everything that's a tradition has to be misogynistic. You have no idea what the men did before you arrived or even the day before. Maybe they did all the grocery shopping, maybe they moved all the tables and chairs so the family could get together, spruce up the yard and maybe cut the grass. These are all just guesses but equally as baseless as your misogynistic claims. \n\nIf your boyfriend loves football, maybe try to get into it. If you hate it then don't, but what's stopping you from asking when you're not at a holiday event and he's watching it at home, what's going on and what they're doing. Football is fun when you actually understand it, but most girls call it stupid. \n\nIt seems like there was no way BF was gonna get out of this without some form of an upset GF. You even said you WANTED to learn more about his family but made zero effort. BF knows his family, did he need to take you around to every person himself to get you to talk to them? \n\nYou sound like you intentionally made the day miserable and pouted so you could pick a fight with your BF about some bullshit because of a situation you let yourself stay in. \n\nYou should have, gotten a drink, asked how everyone was and enjoyed the holiday but you didn't and you ruined your boyfriends in the meantime. \n\nThe more I think about it. Yes, YTA.", "YTA - you weren't excluded from the men's activity - an activity that's essentially a tradition (watching football on Thankgiving). You weren't told to leave. You weren't told to do anything. You went to a family gathering and expected your BF to ignore his family and spend time with you doing things that none of his family were doing. \n\nIs that reasonable? \n\nThis is one day - a day of celebration and tradition.\n\nCertainly have a talk with your BF about whether or not this tradition will continue in your own home, but you don't have the right to judge his family's tradition, especially if they seem happy with it and you weren't forced to do anything here. You simply didn't like what was on offer and pouted.", "i\u2019m gonna go with a soft ESH \u2026 your bf and his family are TA for obvious reasons, but i also think you\u2019re TA. it\u2019s a bit entitled to show up to another  family\u2019s holiday celebrations and expect them to cater to you specifically, especially if it\u2019s your first time meeting them. i\u2019ve been uncomfortable during holidays at other people\u2019s houses plenty of times but also recognized it wasn\u2019t my place to push my expectations of the holiday onto them.\nalso - the women tried to reach out to you and be welcoming and you completely blew them off. i\u2019m not saying you had to help cook or spend your whole day in the kitchen with them, but you could have at least tried to get to know them? they\u2019re still part of your bfs family.", "YTA, you are selfish. You tried to talk over the game while a group of people, who were all there before you, were trying to pay attention to what they were watching (something they were all probably looking forward to as well). The only thing that was awkward was you, and you made it that way.\n\nNo one said you had to go make the food. They were all invested in something and you were upset you weren't getting the attention you wanted.", "His family tradition is pretty straightforward. \n\nIf you're in the football room then it's for watching football.   If you want to chat then you don't go to the football room.\n\nYou wanted to chat in the football room with people that only wanted to watch football.  There was a whole room full of people that would have loved to chat with you but they were beneath you apparently. \n\nMy wife's family has the same tradition as well.  The men watch football and the women chat.  If a man wants to chat he leaves the football room and goes to the chatting room.  If a woman wants to check on the score she leaves the chatting room and goes to the football room.\n\nI don't think it's actually about your gender, it's really whether or not you respect the purposes of the rooms.", "Personally I think you wanted thanksgiving to be about you and you pouted away the day.  I've done that - it's not fun for me.  Most days in this life are not about you and fitting in is the mission.  Other days that are about you, help other people fit in and find happiness.", "YTA - it does not sound like misogyny to me. \n\nIt sounds like half the group likes football and bond over it and the other half doesn't. \n\nSo they instead were in the kitchen hanging out (and watching TV in there you said?).\n\nSo you chose to go hang out with the people watching football instead of the group talking which is what you were doing and wanting to do? Instead trying to talk and make conversation as they watch football is a little rude too. Let them enjoy it. \n\nYou did not have to help with food prep. You could have just went in there and talked with people because that's what it sounded like you wanted to do?\n\n\nEdit - Now I agree the men should have helped more. Did they clear the tables, take out trash? Cook the chicken? I hope they did something otherwise that's really not fair.", "I think op is overreacting", "YTA. Just go to the kitchen and spend some time with them. They seemed very inviting and cooking for Thanksgiving is a joy for some people. I feel like you are leaving alot out of this story...", "ESH. No, the men should not be expecting the women to do all the meal prep so your BF is definitely the bigger asshole here but you are also somewhat one for expecting your BF to not watch football because you personally don't like it. There are times when your S/O can take the time and do something they are interested in and not be focused on you all the time.", "YTA for not trying to make friends and getting to know the people in the kitchen and/or not trying to enjoy the football with the people watching it. At no point did anyone tell you that you can't watch football because you are a woman, you just don't want to because you don't like football. The kitchen ladies seemed like they wanted to spend time with you and you rebuffed them. Sometimes you have to do things that other people like instead of just doing what you like all the time. \n\nWhat exactly did you want your boyfriend to do, anyway?", "\u201cI don\u2019t like sports and no one was talking to me, but I refuse to go where they will\u201d\nFeminism is a disease.

It sounds like you didn\u2019t like what you saw, so you didn\u2019t give it much of a shot. Not even trying to hangout with the girls of his family, IMO, is a bad look even if you didn\u2019t like their traditions.

Where's the sexism? You don't like football? Don't watch.  Don't want to cook? Don't.

Perfect opportunity to bond with the people closest to him and you blew it.Nothing wrong with the guys chilling for a bit . Why should your boyfriend hold your hand the whole time you are there? \nAs an adult it\u2019s extremely important to be able to hold a conversation with people. It\u2019s hard to get to know people if you are clinging to your boyfriend and being awkward. \nBtw I\u2019m a woman and I\u2019m sick and tired of men being accused of being misogynistic when in a lot of cases that\u2019s not the case. You just sound a bit immature and socially akward", "I think YTA - like other people said, you were \u201cinvited\u201d not \u201cbanished\u201d to the kitchen, to where the people who don\u2019t care about football were hanging out. \n\nI come from a large Irish family and this is how a lot of holidays pan out - the women (but actually anyone not bothered about racing or football or any other sport that might be on) having fun, chats and drinks in the kitchen and helping as needed, then another group watching sports and drinking beers in the living room. \n\nThe kitchen\u2019s always where the craic is.\n\nAll that said, the boyfriend\u2019s also a bit of an arse for not taking more pains to help you settle in and not feel banished.", "ESH. Your boyfriend should\u2019ve gone in the kitchen with you and your mom and introduced you to everyone, asked what you wanted to do, and THEN go sit down and watch football.

Yes he didn\u2019t introduce you, but you could\u2019ve just as easily gone into the kitchen where your boyfriend\u2019s mom invited you and she would\u2019ve picked up the introductions/including you, it sounded like she\u2019s pretty friendly from how she received you. His family sucks for having gender segregated holidays, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll change just because you don\u2019t like it, because apparently that\u2019s how they like to do things.

I would rather sit and watch sports, even ones I do not follow or like, to be close to my husband. The kitchen is one place i am not comfortable in, (my husband is a way better cook then me and does most the cooking while I do all the cleaning..works for us).  If OP stays with BF then she will know what to expect next time and if she does not want to be in the kitchen dont go, if she doesnt like sports, bring a book or something to do while sitting close to BF. No need to try to talk to those enjoying the game or those that enjoy cooking. Entertain yourself. I love reading so I would bring a book. Bring something you enjoy.

You're the asshole because you want an entire family to confirm to your gender ideals. They like their traditional gender roles. Fine. But they weren't forcing them on you. As far as I can tell nobody told you that you had to be in the kitchen with the women. They said you could go in there if you were in the mood for conversation and welcomed you warmly. Nobody told you that you couldn't be with the men watching football but that wasn't to your liking because they were concentrating on the game instead of entertaining your conversation. They were there because they wanted to watch football and talk about football.

Instead of spending time getting to know them you insulted them by claiming there\u2019s something sexist about the way they spend time getting to know each other. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with traditions where men spend a bit of time with men and women a bit of time with women - obviously if anyone is non-binary then they can choose what they\u2019d rather be doing, and any woman is free to do what they want, but you literally complained about both options instead of simply picking what you\u2019d rather be doing. I don\u2019t blame you too much because we live currently in a society that puts a lot of social pressure on women to feel like there\u2019s something inherently wrong with this, it leaves plenty of people confused, just like here: \u201c lI didn\u2019t want to be watching football and would rather have been getting to know some of his family, but being told I should join the other people who didn\u2019t want to watch football and would rather be talking getting to know each other (and god forbid being welcomed/integrated into the family like a daughter while preparing some food) is soooo sexist so instead I made an issue about that so I complained that I didn\u2019t get to know any of his family.\u201d\n\nIn countries with the highest equality of opportunity, we\u2019re seeing people finally breaking through some of this third wave feminist nonsense and realizing that it\u2019s ok if in some ways some times our actions indicate that (shocking!) our preferences reveal that while it\u2019s completely ok when people are the exception to any \u201crule\u201d, there are things that a majority of men will enjoy more than women and vice versa. \n\nThis is true of nearly every species, definitely so with mammals, and will be true with us. \n\nThe only reason YTA is the entitled way you went about it.
