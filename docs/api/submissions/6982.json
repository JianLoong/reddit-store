You have no reason to tolerate their bullshit. Have you ever told them that this behaviour is way over the line for you and it's actually hurtful or are they the type to dismiss something like that and call you a snowflake? It's probably the latter. I hope you'll be able to escape them once college's over. Good luck, you'll ace that test!", "Your entire family sound like bullies. Your mom should be ashamed!

I have been to a few homes like that and ... never returned.  \n\nJust so you know, once you start to work hard, pull away, become independent, and then successful, jerks like your parents will attempt to manipulate you in different ways, including playing the victim.\n\nIn the future you might find it more productive to not \"storm out\" and to try to keep your cool.  Simply say that you think the way they are behaving is childish or mean and you have other things to do.\n\nGood luck on your test and keep working hard!", "NTA. Your family sounds awful. This is not normal or acceptable behaviour. Take your test, get your job and get the hell out of there.", "Wow, they all sound toxic.

If you can live on your own, I would recommend it. That environment is TOXIC and I feel like their acting on their jealousy of you... they are so jealous of you bettering yourself.

Your parents are clearly showing that they don\u2019t believe in your capabilities or of working hard. Mom actually sounds like she jealous of your achievements. She should be ashamed of treating a child like that instead of trying to encourage you. Good luck on your test, you\u2019ll do great!!", "NTA.", "NTA  have you tried laughing? If anyone made a face like that at me I'd have lost it. The next time she does that do it back and just repeat everything she says, bet she'll stop.", "NTA.  Don't give them space in your head, you got this!!  You are so ahead if them, you KNOW what they are doing and you are believing in yourself (and what a great professor!!!) We cannot wait for you to prove them wrong!", "NTA. Your family is just toxic. I'm sorry :/", "NTA.\n\nMy suggestion?  Greyrock to keep your cool, do NOT let them know how much you're making (while claiming to be dead broke), and save up enough to GET AWAY from them.", "NTA, and your mom sucks ass.", "Dude what the fuck\n\nNTA\n\nAt that point I think I would have raised hell\n\n(Also congratulations on getting so far in education!!! I hope the test goes well!)", "NTA, it\u2019s also good to remember that the non toxic family member always feels crazy because toxic people don\u2019t like anyone calling them out. \n\nHope you can get away and find a happy place and people to share your life with.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry your family treats you like that. If you can, maybe try to minimize the time you spend with them until you can move out (if that is your situation)", "You need to go out and get a found family. People who support you and who you enjoy. Your mom is a cruel person. The rest of your family is just complicit.  Don't listen to them.   I pray that you do well. You study hard and do your best. You said that your professor said that you could be successful either way. Good luck, and just shake off the haters.", "NTA - Your mom sounds bi polar with a narcissistic twist.  Ill mental health hurts everyone involved.  I tried making the screwed up face you described and got a kink in my neck.  See them only on holidays!", "I assume your family is paying for some or all of college.  Get what you can from them and then go no contact.  They are abusive, and you don't need that in your life.

If venomous words are all your mom has for you and she lashes out when you try to set boundaries, then she's not a person worth having in your life.  She will only ever cut you down to make herself feel good and the rest of your family apparently follow her lead so that she goes after you and not them.

What is your mom\u2019s deal, that sneering sounds so weird?? That sounds like a bizarre and hurtful conversation and you\u2019re right to feel like something was off.

I am sure she's never been accused of being senstive and supportive.", "NTA That is some horrible nasty interaction going on. Good choice to walk away. After your test is passed, maybe you should build a better family with people of your choice.", "If I told them I was upset and it crossed a line for me they would never let me live it down. My mom in particular is big on freaking the fuck out anytime someone else has hurt emotions but when she expresses hurt everyone is expected to listen.", "This kind of mother doesn\u2019t know the meaning of shame.", "It makes me so mad they can make me feel this way. Just this one morning was enough to take away all my confidence. I've had straight A's and was really hopeful about the test but now i'm terrified again and have ordered more study guides just to feel better. I wonder if i'll ever get to the point where I don't feel like i'm automatically wrong.", "The funny thing is they are paying for nothing. I am about 11K in debt now.", "NTA. \n\nI agree with your assessment. In my personal experience, when a toxic individual already has power over you. Telling them that their behavior is hurtful tends to fan the flames and cause more problems. Basically once they know it irritates you, they will do it more, and more.\n\nAs awful as it is, the only thing you can do is grey rock. Which means to give them zero information about anything. They can't harass you about something they don't know about.\n\nAnd just to reiterate others. Your family is hella toxic. Your sibling is probably just feeding off them and hopefully won't stay that way. But from the way you describe your mother... Well she seems like the kind of person who will eventually be disowned by her kids but never understand what it is she did to ever deserve this treatment (we know what she did).", "Have you browsed these other reddits related to your parents? r/raisedbynarcissists r/justnofamily and keep this one for when you get into a relationship r/justnomil", "Then you don't need them for anything.  Leave them behind, pass that test, get a good job and never think about them again."]}
