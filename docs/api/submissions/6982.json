Your parents are clearly showing that they don\u2019t believe in your capabilities or of working hard. Mom actually sounds like she jealous of your achievements.

I am about 11K in debt now.", "NTA. \n\nI agree with your assessment. In my personal experience, when a toxic individual already has power over you. Telling them that their behavior is hurtful tends to fan the flames and cause more problems. Basically once they know it irritates you, they will do it more, and more.\n\nAs awful as it is, the only thing you can do is grey rock. Which means to give them zero information about anything. They can't harass you about something they don't know about.\n\nAnd just to reiterate others. Your family is hella toxic. Your sibling is probably just feeding off them and hopefully won't stay that way. But from the way you describe your mother... Well she seems like the kind of person who will eventually be disowned by her kids but never understand what it is she did to ever deserve this treatment (we know what she did).", "Have you browsed these other reddits related to your parents? r/raisedbynarcissists r/justnofamily and keep this one for when you get into a relationship r/justnomil", "Then you don't need them for anything.

Not responding much may help you as getting to react and defend yourself probably delights your mom.  \n\nBe sure that when you are successful doing things your way, she will declare your success is because of her.  She will also start demanding the benefits of your success for herself while still running you down.  \n\nIt is inevitable, you can\u2019t change her, you just have to shut out the noise and not react or agree with everything she says and then do what you want.\n\nHopefully, your successes will help you move away at some point.", "Abusive parents. Say very little to them and plan your exit.", "Your mom is a narcissist", "NTA\u2026Don\u2019t let your families asshole behavior and fear of success stop you from succeeding and doing what\u2019s best for you.
