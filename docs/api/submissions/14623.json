We live at the same address and are constantly opening each other\u2019s mail. \n\nWhen my husband wanted to name our son after him (his dad passed away 3 years before our son was born so had ceased being \u201cLittle John\u201d for the most part at that stage) it was a hard veto from me.\n\n(Edit: used the inch symbol instead of foot symbol)", "I'm not even a Jr. I just have a vaguely similar name to my mother, and it has been flipping awful.", "It also makes legal stuff really obnoxious later. My husband has the same name as his dad, and that made it really easy for his dad to do some identify theft stuff. People also have no idea how messy it makes banking, which is kind of a big deal when the wrong person's info shows up on *your* credit report. Dad dies, credit card company receives death certificate, oops now both of your accounts were closed because you two had the same name in the same county and it's easy to make mistakes.\n\nHaving the same name as a parent creates a lot of headache that people don't think about at all", "Also if his fiance hates the nickname DJ, has OP told his family to stop calling him that or does the whole family think the mom who carried the baby every day for 9 months should get over it and let *everyone* ignore what she wants? The disrespect this family is showing this woman, yikes.", "Not really, you have the option of putting Jr, II, or nothing on the birth certificate.  Neither Jr or II is automatic.", "This is correct. People that put Jr or II or III on the actual birth certificate have no idea what they are doing.", "Pretty sure people who do it this way don't actually include the junior/senior in their name. Someone going to call their kid \"Michael Senior\" in the hopes that they then have a kid called \"Michael Junior\"? Or do they go and get their name changed as soon as they have a child to swap from \"Junior\" to \"Senior\". Also, here in the UK I've never seen someone who has the same name as their dad  include Junior in their birth certificate, or rarely even called junior, but have seen people with the same name as their dad having II involved..", "It is (at least in the US). For example even though my grandfather died my father still has the Jr suffix legally qnd unless he files a name change with the court that won't change.", "No, that\u2019s actually not how that works. My uncle is the fifth, his father was the fourth, his father before him was the third, etc\u2026 The point is to keep track of that name through generations, you don\u2019t scoot everyone up a rank when someone dies wtf.", "No. That\u2019s not how it works. The only one that changes is that when someone decides to make a Jr, they become a Sr. Henceforth, everyone in the succession after Sr would be Jr, III, IV, V, etc. If you are given the name Henry VIII at birth, it will not change whether you have more or less Henries.", "My suffix is on my birth certificate, social security card, voter registration, and driver's license. It's part of my legal name and will not change.", "That's not correct. My legal name has \"Jr.\" after my surname. It's on my birth certificate, and all my government information.", "Do you think Charles III is written on his birth certificate? They published the queens death certificate and II isn\u2019t written on it anywhere, in fact the only regnal number on there is \u201cKing George VI\u201d as her father\u2019s *occupation* because George wasn\u2019t even his actual name, never mind VI.\n\nThe number is a regnal number, it\u2019s used to distinguish between people who have the same name (birth or assumed) and who hold the same office, so unless both he and his child are going to become ruling monarchs or popes who keep their name, a name that is also different to any previous Pope or monarch, the use of regnal numbers when referring to them is pretty unlikely.", "The monarch titles are not the same as when you tack on a Jr, III, IV, etc...\n\nIf you name your child John David Smith Jr, that is their legal name.", "but u just explained he doesn't even need jr at the end. Legally it's II and not jr.", "Man, and here I am just happy my dad didn't get his way in naming me Tralfaz.", "Well...... at least it's the middle name, I inherited the first name because of my families Irish Catholic tradition of naming the first born after the father, a tradition I swore off when I changed my name.", "Honestly, that would be slightly better than sharing the same first name. ideally, a whole original name would be the perfect resolution for me, at least, hence why I changed my name", "Right. OP is totally out of line and has bizarre ideas about actually including \u201cJunior\u201d on the birth certificate. \n\nI was responding to the poster above.", "So what happens if your son continues the tradition? Will your grandkid have the same exact name as his Dad down to the \u201cjunior\u201d? Must be hell for banking and whatnot.", "She doesn\u2019t like the nickname JD and she doesn\u2019t want junior on the birth certificate. That\u2019s solid. She doesnt need \u201creasoning\u201d beyond \u201cI dont like it\u201d. She is already being more than accommodating with the first name.", "It's still a bureaucratic nightmare either way.", "They\u2019re not married, she\u2019s his fianc\u00e9e.  So she still has time to reconsider taking his name, which I personally would.", "I mean they\u2019re not married yet and most people wait until the wedding to change their name. A simple fix to the Junior part would be him taking her last name. There problem solved.", "1. It\u2019s a joke to point out how ridiculous the OP is being.\n\n\n2. They\u2019re not married so she most likely hasn\u2019t taken his name yet.\n\n\n3. Lighten up Francis.", "A double wide with a lease that's been handed down through the generations.", "For real!  I was reading this like...uhm...yall wanna give me a Small 40+ yr old house with no mortgage and land? JFC! I dont care if Groot himswlf lives in the garden!", "I'm guessing you're also Australian. I had the same reaction.", "Depends where the house and 2 acres are.", "I know I'd want that so badly tbh \ud83d\ude2d", "A 6\" man called \"Little John\" sounds completely reasonable. A 6' man on the other hand...", "I should\u2019ve added too that when people would call we would ask junior or senior anyway haha. Not that everyone could clarify and legit remember trying to keep up with what doctor belonged to who and blah blah when I would visit. \n\nUgh, that initial squabble too! My husband, his brother, and their dad share the same first initial and obviously last name. His brother is actually the longer version of his dad\u2019s name lol. And we get my in law\u2019s mail because they travel so often, snowbirds, and I have certainly sent our own stuff.", "I had a Big Anne and Little Anne (grandmother and granddaughter) in my family. I always wondered How Big Anne handled that (she died before I knew her).", "God the midcentury Johns! My ex husbands family had like 4 different Johns all around the same age. His mom has been calling her husband John Lastname pretty much their entire 60 year marriage, to distinguish him from her father and brother and cousin with the same name. \n\nAlso in that family are 5 different people with the same initials, including me :(", "My former MIL and I had the exact same name, except she uses the feminine ending of the Eastern European surname while I adopted the masculine version as it was easier in the UK. We never lived together but we had the same bank, dentist and doctor and at some point all three tried to use her details at my appointment. I can only assume she ran into the same issue, but I went NC with her shortly after my oldest was born. The funniest one was when I walked into the doctor's room, having signed in at the reception desk, and the GP did a comedy double take before double-checking my date of birth. She then said she was shocked because she'd been expecting a woman in her late 50s, and 28 year old me walked in. \n\nFor that reason, I am always so against people sharing names if it is avoidable. It's just unnecessarily difficult, and children deserve a name that is theirs.", "Ugh yes my husbands grandfather was Big John, his dad Johnny Mike (middle name Michael) and then my husband is the 3rd but thankfully goes by his middle name. I\u2019m pregnant with unknown gender and have been adamant to squash the John at the 3rd although I know his family expects it to continue. Let\u2019s just hope it\u2019s another girl ;)", "I mean, you can put Senior too, or IV for someone who's only second of their name. You can do whatever you want. \n\nBut what that person described for Jr vs II is the correct naming convention.", "\"Neither Jr or II is automatic.\"  \nYou're right. And neither one should, etiquette-wise, be put on the birth certificate.", "Whenever I hear anyone's name with a II, III, or IV, it makes me think of Thurston Howell III from Gilligan's Island. Maybe I just didn't run in those circles.", "Yeah I\u2019ve never heard of someone actually having junior in their name", "You know what? You're right. Just looked it up and I'm an idiot. Appreciate the info, tho...", "I am in the US. It wouldn\u2019t change until your dad has a junior himself. Then he would be the 2nd. I have a friend who is the fifth and he goes by Cinco for fun.\n\nYour dad will always be a junior until he has a junior.", "When you start a name, you\u2019re just the name. When you have a junior, you finally become a senior. You\u2019re not born a senior. When your junior has a child, he\u2019s the III. When the III has a child, they become the IV (the fourth) and so on and so forth. You\u2019re not born a Senior.", "Yeah, they are all suffixes. I/II/III/etc. remain regardless of whether a person is living or not. Sr./Jr. technically are only supposed to apply while the person is living. Sr./Jr. cannot skip generations (i.e., must be a father/son), while I/II/III/etc. can skip generations, because with both sets of suffixes, the full name (first, middle, and last) are supposed to be the same in order to truly be Sr./Jr. or I/II/III/etc. - this, of course, is not always practiced. Also, someone can be both a Sr. and I, or a Jr. and II, and so on. \n\nI have a cousin who is named after his father (first name), but my aunt intentionally refused to give him the same middle name so he \"couldn't\" be a junior because she didn't want him called \"junior\" and ironically their first names also start with D and she didn't like the nickname \"DJ\" either. \n\nIn the end, names, including suffixes and prefixes, are all made up anyway and you can go by whatever you want. lol", "Yes you do. Not \"scooting\" the numerals is what pretentious people that don't understand the etiquette do.\n\nIt makes you look prole not posh to have \"Joe Schmoo V\"", "Well in his particular case his legal name has changed several times since birth.\n\nBut the point is, he didn\u2019t become Charles II because the previous King Charles died. \n\nOP Junior, however, would have JR as his legal name which would not automatically change upon OP\u2019s death.", "No you\u2019re right. I\u2019m just embarrassed for him.", "Yes i agree with all of that.", "My mom and I share only a first name and up until I changed my last name after marriage I would have issues.", "I stand corrected.  \n\nSo unless OP changes his last name, the child won't be a junior.  \n\nProbably best solution here is for OP to give up naming the child after him.", "A family heirloom, if you will", "The family homestead.  It still has the original cabinets, carpeting, fixtures and roof from the 1970s.", "Groot in the garden would be a unique selling point.", "Nah US\u2026east coast beast coast", "No, if he'd had a son and given them the same name they would have been a III.\n\nIt wouldn't have happened because my mom vetoed it and they ended up with two girls.", "No, most people literally don't use Sr/Jr that way.  \n\nIf my dad was named after my grandfather, grandfather is the Sr, my dad is the Jr.  Then I'm given the same name, I'm now the third \"in line\" to be given that name, so I would be III or \"the third.\"  I wouldn't become the 2nd or \"junior\" when my grandfather died, because I still would have been the third \"in line\" that received that name.  While I'm technically the \"junior\" in status to my dad, from the point of view of the lineage of names, I would still be the third person in line to have the name, hence III.\n\nI get what you're trying to say, but almost nobody thinks of the names that way.  \n\n1st person in family to have a name:  They get the Sr.\n2nd person in family to have the name: Jr\n3rd person in family to have the name: III, or \"The Third\"\netc.", "Its also the FULL name. Family tradition is 1st born son get the first name, but middle name is maternal grandfather's first name. Because the middle names are different, technically there aren't Sr/Jr. I'm the 5th generation of this, but I'm not My Name the fifth. And it sure as hell doesn't go on the birth certificate.\n\nSo if John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt names his kid John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt, that kid is a Junior.\n\nIf his kid is John Jacob Jason Schmidt, he's not a Junior.\n\nIf John Jacob Jason Schmidt names his kid John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt, THAT kid is a Junior.\n\nYou are of course free to call them Junior, Johnny, JJ, or asshole. \n\nBut I really advise against naming your kid after yourself, as it today's automated society, the algorithms will fuck up and forever create havoc.", "Yeah, but I don't lose being the \"junior\" to my dad when he eventually passes.  I'm still <his son> Jr because I was directly named after him.", "I meant he would be considered the second. I find people drop junior and embrace II as junior can be emasculating", "Look, I think the whole thing is stupid, but think about it for a minute. What happens if you give your son the same name? Is he <name> jr jr?", "No, you do lose junior when your dad passes.  You can become senior.  You can keep II after your name if you are the second with the exact same name.", "Yea I read it a ton of times now and nowhere does it say middle name. I\u2019m just not assuming that OP is so dumb to think Junior is a middle name and y\u2019all are assuming that he is. Will hope for clarification \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe", "I just want you to know that I understand what you\u2019re saying here and it\u2019s logical", "The fuck you on? My brother is a junior. His birth certificate literally has Jr. At the end. He's legally First Middle Last Jr. That doesn't go away when our father dies.", "No. Just no. Wrong wrong wrong. When the Senior dies, most people either DROP or KEEP the Jr, not move up.", "Jr is on my birth certificate.  It's part of my name,  Jr stays when my dad passes because he still will have existed, and I have literally never used II on any documentation ever, so it wouldn't make sense.", "No. Just no. Wrong wrong wrong. When the Senior dies, most people either DROP or KEEP the Jr, not move up.\n\n\nETA - senior, Jr, the 3rd, the 4th, and so on designates what number of order they were named, and not WHOSE ALIVE WITH THAT NAME. it's not like when George Foreman dies, all of his sons named George or going to slide up one space.", "Fair enough, I was reading it that by D____ Junior he means to call him D_____ Junior Surname. Because he wants Junior on the birth certificate. Hopefully you're right and he's not that dumb.", "It sounds like your family didn't know how it works.", "Your family chose Junior as a name like some people choose Walter.  The way your family is doing it isn't the norm.  Sorry that learning about the centuries old naming convention is blowing your mind.", "and that's why this is a stupid idea, the Jr is supposed to distinguish the older from the younger, it's like a title, it's not supposed to be permanent", "I mean if he really wants the kids middle name to be Junior he\u2019s automatically an AH. Lol", "Naming your kid your name is stupid because of the bureaucratic nightmare that comes from the same names. The amount of times my dad and brother's stuff have been mixed up despite having separate SSNs is crazy. Even with the legal Jr after my brother's name. I am always warning people away from a lifetime of paperwork and confusion.", "Fully agree!"]}
