I can only assume she ran into the same issue, but I went NC with her shortly after my oldest was born.

She then said she was shocked because she'd been expecting a woman in her late 50s, and 28 year old me walked in. \n\nFor that reason, I am always so against people sharing names if it is avoidable.

I/II/III/etc. remain regardless of whether a person is living or not. Sr./Jr. technically are only supposed to apply while the person is living. Sr./Jr. cannot skip generations (i.e., must be a father/son), while I/II/III/etc. can skip generations, because with both sets of suffixes, the full name (first, middle, and last) are supposed to be the same in order to truly be Sr./Jr. or I/II/III/etc. - this, of course, is not always practiced. Also, someone can be both a Sr. and I, or a Jr. and II, and so on. \n\nI have a cousin who is named after his father (first name), but my aunt intentionally refused to give him the same middle name so he \"couldn't\" be a junior because she didn't want him called \"junior\" and ironically their first names also start with D and she didn't like the nickname \"DJ\" either. \n\nIn the end, names, including suffixes and prefixes, are all made up anyway and you can go by whatever you want. lol", "Yes you do.
