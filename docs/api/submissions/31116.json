She's kind, gentle, beautiful, and I love being with her. That being said, she's not the most confident person. When we were still just dating, she often talked down on herself or let other people talk down on her. I tried my hardest to instill some confidence within her, and although she still sometimes makes negative comments about her appearance or intelligence, she doesn't do it as often. All that to say, whenever I see an opportunity to uplift her, I take it. I've fallen into the habit of giving her compliments all the time (which I think is a normal thing for wives to do for their partners anyway).\n\nI come from a family of five (my mom, stepdad, older brother \"Greg\", me, and my sister \"Yvonne\") However, the problem lies with my sister. She recently got out of a long relationship that she always thought was going to last forever. I was sad for her because she was very upset but her ex wasn't really the nicest to her and she often complained about how he never complimented her. Our mother's birthday was a few days ago and she wanted to go out to a pretty fancy restaurant since this birthday was a milestone. My wife spent so much time shopping since she was convinced nothing she tried on looked good and then she finally found a dress she liked which she made look gorgeous and I made sure she knew it. \n\nWhen we got to the restaurant, my family complimented my wife on her new dress and me on my outfit. My stepdad remarked about how we \"made a lovely couple\". I could tell Yvonne was upset by the comment so I thanked my stepdad swiftly and changed the subject. We began our meal and everything was going great until I looked over and saw my wife smiling. I told her something along the lines of \"You have the most beautiful smile\" which again upset my sister. She then talked about how it was weird how \"obsessed\" I was with my wife, especially in public and around her when I knew she just had a really bad breakup. I felt bad at first but then she continued saying that \"\\[wife's name\\] wasn't that great and I needed to stop lying to her\" which I felt was super rude and uncalled for (I could also tell my wife was upset since she likes my sister and thought they were friends). I told her that she needed to grow up, stop making her failed relationship everyone else's problem, and that it was not our fault her boyfriend didn't like her enough to show her affection. Greg and our mother agreed that what Yvonne said was really rude but said that I could've saved my compliments until after the dinner so that I wouldn't upset my sister.

Your sister needs to accept that your compliments to your wife have nothing to do with her failed relationship. It's beautiful to see you uplifting your wife's confidence, and she deserves all the love and appreciation in the world. Keep being supportive of each other!", "You should have \"saved [your] compliments until after the dinner\" so that you wouldn't upset your sister? \n\nBwahahahaha!\n\nIs your sister made of tissue paper? Glass?\n\nNTA", "NTA, sounds like your sister thinks that a compliment to another person is somehow derogatory to her. she sounds low at the moment so I get why she is feeling Blue. but dont you change your relationship to suit her. explain how this is what a happy marriage is all about, that your sorry for her breakup, but the world doesn't revolve around her.  she can't expect people to walk on eggshells around her just because her relationship didn't work.", "Just because her world stopped doesn't mean everyone else's should too. If she can't handle someone complimenting their spouse then she probably shouldn't be going out to family dinners. NTA.", "NTA - Keep complimenting your wife. Tell the haters to fuck off.", "NTA. Your sister was projecting all the negativity she was feeling onto your wife. Jealous over the fact that her sister loves her wife and treats her well. It was an 'in your face' compare and contrast to how she allowed her ex to treat her. I think you did well in shutting her down right then and there. She spewed her venom on your wife in public and she deserved to have it handed right back to her in the same fashion.\n\nOP, relationships are hard and challenging times come to every couple. Don't you ever allow anyone to dull your wife's shine on your watch and hold onto these moments and memories. These are the things that will help the both of you get through the tough days.", "NTA. It\u2019s a shame Y said that to your wife. Obviously you\u2019ll need to tone it down around your sister in the future because she\u2019s struggling and complimenting your wife in front of Y will probably make your wife uncomfortable now, if your wife is even willing to hang out with Y again. I\u2019m not sure I would be. The only inappropriate person leading up to and causing this crisis was Y. Your response to your sister was unnecessarily harsh but not odd considering you must have been taken totally by surprise. Still, worth an apology when seeking to help your sister realign and make her own apologies.", "Your sister is immature and selfish. \n\nYour wife shouldn\u2019t be punished for your sister\u2019s insecurity. \n\nNTA.", "Her comment about your wife is clearly out of order, so I don\u2019t really blame you for your reaction, even if it does sound very harsh on the face of it. Of course away from the dinner table in private would\u2019ve been better, but in the heat of the moment I guess it wasn\u2019t possible \n\nHowever, if you were aware that she was upset in her relationship, partly because her partner didn\u2019t compliment her, then I really don\u2019t think you needed to choose that particular setting to shower your wife with more compliments. Especially because it sounds like your family already gave a couple of compliments to yourself and your wife when you arrived\n\nI\u2019m not gonna say you\u2019re an a**hole for this. I get your reason for doing that in general to boost your wife\u2019s confidence, which is great, but you easily could\u2019ve toned it down in this instance, IMO.\n\nHopefully it\u2019s all resolved now", "ESH:  Hey I was with you until you said. \n\n>that it was not our fault her boyfriend didn't like her enough to show her affection\n\nYour sister was being a jerk 100%, but that line you said just added to those feelings. You're saying it wasn't because he was a bad partner it was your sister fault he didn't compliment her.  \n\nThe way you build your wife up is great, but you just became one of those people who took your wife confidence away but to your sister.  Again everything else I agree with but that was a low blow", "ESH.\n\nDude I'm totally with you, it's perfectly normal for people who love each other to be obsessed (seriously,  nobody on the planet is a amazing as my husband,  10/10, totally obsessed). Your sister is out of line and needs to stop projecting her post-break up issues and talking negatively about your wife just because you're a solid spouse.\n\nThat said,  this:\n\n> and that it was not our fault her boyfriend didn't like her enough to show her affection. G\n\nwas an intentional low blow. Was it asked for and to be expected between siblings? Yeah, probably. But it was still a low blow.", "NTA. I would have looked at her and said, \u201cWhat, your boyfriend never complimented you?\u201d Then smirked and said, \u201dI can see why.\u201d\n\nYeah, I often respond to AHs by demonstrating that I can be a bigger AH.", "NTA but just because you may not have been wrong, doesn\u2019t mean there is not a better way. If some time has passed, it\u2019s normal to reengage but if this is fresh, there was better ways for both of you to handle the evening. But I f your wife needs constant compliments to feel confident, or you feel the need to constantly compliment her because you need her to know how much you love her, that\u2019s another issue.", "[removed]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not everything is about your sister even if she can\u2019t see that. Relationships are hard work and letting your partner know how amazing you think they are is a great way to keep the spark alive. Don\u2019t let her BS affect how you treat your partner and good on you for standing up for your wife. Your sister will hopefully realize rather than being jealous she should be happy her sibling is in the good kind of relationship she wants to find in the future.", "NTA\n\nwhy do they think they can police your words? that's just stupid.", "NTA. Sounds like your sister is extremely jealous of your wife. With her stank attitude I doubt she\u2019ll ever find a man who will love her and compliment her.", " NTA - sorry for your sister but she was out of live.", "Maybe you could\u2019ve refrained from complimenting her so much? Maybe\nBut your sister\u2019s comment perhaps is EXACTLY the reason why your wife needs that attention from you\n\nWhy TF would someone say something like that??", "Of course you're NTA. You treat your queen how you want to treat your queen.", "NTA.  Your sister is feeling insecure and bitter.  That is her problem, not yours.  Continue letting your wife know how much you love and appreciate her.  It is a wonderful thing to be in love with your other half, and it is amazing and so uplifting to hear from your spouse how much they love and care for you.", "NTA. You aren't obliged to treat your wife with less care to please your sister, whose bitterness is no excuse for being astonishingly rude. Your sister needs to step back and listen to herself because that kind of behavior is never ok.", "NTA. I could see the complaint of it being annoying when people pay lovey dovey compliments in front of other people. The only response I think is fair is \u201cmy gosh get a room haha\u201d. Sisters comments were rude and mean.", "NTA.", "NTA - you complimenting your wife is completely unrelated to your sister. She is being ridiculous", "NTA - now if it had been something like 'your tits look extra hot tonight,' then that would have been AH comment in the circumstances.\n\nETA, I meant to your wife, but it would be an awkward thing to say to your sister too", "NTA. Your sister could learn from you how people are supposed to treat each other in a relationship, but I guess she'd rather be bitter. Hopefully, she will heal and learn to be civil and happy for others someday. You sound like a great partner. Keep being you.", "Oh, come on, you know everyone is going to say NTA", "NTA\n\nIt's pretty self centred of your sister to expect the two of you to stop acting like a loving couple because she's broken up with her boyfriend.  \n\nHer comment about your wife was completely out of line and I wouldn't be surprised if she's damaged permanently their relationship because as someone with low self esteem myself, I  wouldn't forget a comment like that or feel the same about the person who said it.\n\nDon't even think about apologising unless she begs your wife's forgiveness and means it.", "NTA. Misery loves company.\n\nKeep complimenting your wife and being happy and in love.", "You and your wife are setting a great example of what a happy couple is. Your sister should take note, and find a partner who treats her with the same respect. \n\nNTA.", "NTA - grow up sis.", "Of course you are NTA. Your sister behaved like a child.", "She really does, and thank you.", "Right? How utterly ridiculous.   Sister needs to gtfu", "It sounds like OP said one thing, how is that 'showering' her wife with compliments?", "I get what your saying but I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s on OP that her sister didn\u2019t feel comfortable. Everyone has different love languages that they appreciate. I understand not everyone likes PDA and is comfortable with it, but she is giving her wife compliments. Would it have been easier to not say it to be easier on her sister? Yes. But I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s her job to tip toe around someone. It kinda feels like the sister took it personally and it wasn\u2019t directed towards.", "Nah, fuck that. Sister absolutely deserved it for directly, personally attacking OPs wife - who had done nothing at all wrong. And if that's the kind of mean-spirited petulant streak she has laying so close to the surface of her, then maybe there is something to be said about why her own boyfriend left her. Genuinely nice people - even if they are hurting terribly - won't make comments like that towards innocent parties. Like OP and his wife were here.", "This happened two days ago and the only reason I said that was because I was in shock although I regret being so harsh. I never said my wife needs constant compliments, just that I give her them because I like to. I don\u2019t really see how that\u2019s an issue\u2026", "???", "You working so hard to compliment your wife to counteract her low self-esteem is so kind and loving. Don't ever stop, no matter what anyone says!", "Totally agree.  You don't put other people down in order to lift yourself up.", "I don\u2019t. You added it. When unnecessary points are added deductions are made. What point does your wife\u2019s insecurities play into the story. Why did you feel the need to add that fact to a story about you and your sister?", "It was really a point to explain my complimenting her was a habit of mine and was not done intentionally to hurt my sister.", "Ah I see. Just seems weird to put your SO\u2019s insecurities out there. A simple, I adore my wife and love complimenting her would have sufficed. But I see why you added it. Hope all works out between you two. Sisters are so important. You both said harsh words, I hope apologies from both sides happen\u2026I hope she apologizes to your wife as well\u2026that was uncool", "FFS, it was obvious why OP included it.", "You have to put that your wife has insecurities to highlight why you enjoy complimenting her? I\u2019d hope a  spouse would love to compliment their spouse just because they love them, not because they may have had negative self talk when they were dating."]}
