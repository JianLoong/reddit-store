I also have a cat named Cloud.\n\nMe and some of my friends have been planning on going on a week-long road trip for a while now, and we finally found a day when all of us would be free.\n\nI called Lisa as soon as we found a date and asked her if she would be able to watch Cloud. My family lives out of state, and most of my other friends had their own things going on. Lisa was the only person who could watch him. \n\nLisa has been dealing with depression for a while, which I get is hard and I've tried to be very supportive. It causes her to have a lack of motivation to do things, which I understand but unfortunately, there are times when it gets way out of proportion.\n\nAs soon as I asked Lisa, she immediately refused. She said she doesn't need something else to take care of when she's apparently having trouble taking care of herself. I did understand, but it made me kinda pissed because I've done so many favors and I would've helped her if she was in my position, but when I brought that up a few times she agreed.\n\nDay of the road trip, I brought Cloud over to her dorm, and she immediately made a rule that Cloud had to stay in the bathroom. I was uncomfortable with this and didn't complain. I also brought Cloud's food and litterbox.\n\nAnyways, me and my friends went on the trip, had a blast, and I checked in on how Cloud was doing a few times, to which Lisa would reply 'Fine' too. \n\nLast night, I came back and drove over to pick up Cloud. \n\nWhen I came and Lisa let me in, she had a guilty look on her face which made me really suspicious. I ran to the bathroom and opened the door, and I was just fucking disgusted. Cloud's litterbox was filthy, and their bowl was nearly empty. Plus, Cloud in general looked miserable. \n\nI turned around and asked her what the fuck was the meaning of this, and she burst into tears and said she did her best to care of him. I yelled at her and said if she was doing her best, she wouldn't have let Cloud live in his own shit and fed him. She tried insisting she has been feeding him, but I wouldn't have it. I took Cloud and his stuff and left without another word. I understand depression, but I know I would never neglect someone I love's animal no matter how hard shit got for me.\n\nWhen I got home, their roommate sent me a long-ass text basically calling me a piece of shit for what I said to Lisa, and that I 'caused her to spiral'. And I texted back that sometimes she has to deal with the consequences of her own fucking actions and not everyone is going to kiss her ass 24/7.\n\nMe and Lisa haven't talked since all that's happened. I don't think I was wrong for what I said, but I also don't want this to end our relationship entirely either. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683061079, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13601xz/aita_for_yelling_at_my_gf_for_neglecting_my_cat/", "score": 126, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She told you no, multiple times, and explicitly told you it was because she was struggling to care for herself and did not believe she\u2019s be able to care for your cat.\n\nWhy would *you* neglect your cat by leaving them with someone who told you repeatedly they would be unable to care for them?", "YTA\n\n> I've done so many favors and I would've helped her if she was in my position, but when I brought that up a few times she agreed.\n\nYou guilted her into taking care of an animal she told you she couldn't. If YOU really cared about your car, you would've found it a proper sitter than can take care of it.", "YTA. \n\nShe said no and you guilted her into watching your cat when she **said no** and told you she didn\u2019t think she could manage it. Then, when exactly what she said would happen did, you blew up on her and were a complete and total ass. \n\nThe cat is your responsibility. You chose to leave it with someone who couldn\u2019t care for it and was upfront from the start that they couldn\u2019t care for it. \n\nIf she dumps you for how you acted you 100% deserve it.", "YTA - YOU abused your animal. Not her, YOU.\n\n>As soon as I asked Lisa, she immediately refused. Day of the road trip, I brought Cloud over to her dorm\n\n**You asked if she would cat-sit, she said no, and then you fucking abandoned your cat with her anyways.** You are disrespectful and entitled. You do not deserve to be a cat owner, and it is probably time to let go of the relationship with Lisa. She is not mentally in a place where she can be the type of partner you want or need, so move on and next time use an animal sitting service or don't go out of town. You own this pet, is it your responsibility to make sure it is properly cared for while you are away. Asshole.", "YTA because you guilted her into taking care of the cat when she told you she didn't feel capable of it. Then you screamed at her. You should have found someone else or hired someone to watch your cat.", "YTA. She was honest about her mental state. You proceeded to guilt her. You also minimize her condition. If she had a life-threatening physical illness, would you still be such a AH and ableist? You then berated her and yelled (emotionally abusive). Should a litterbox be cleaned more often? Sure. Is it the end of the world? No. And you have no proof that she didnt feed your cat so get off of that entirely", "YTA, obviously she was feeding him as the bowl wasn\u2019t empty and he was pooping in the litter box.  You guilt tripped her into taking care of a cat that she didn\u2019t want to take care of.", "YTA. You clearly do not understand depression. If she is struggling to take care of herself, then how do you think she would be able to take care of a cat. She told you, no and her why.   \n\n\nAnd instead of you finding someone else, you guilt trip her on all the things you have and would do for her. That's pretty shitty and asshole of you.", "YTA- You claim to \"understand depression\" but also said it \"gets way out proportion\" sometimes. How understanding. Then you guilt trip her into watching your cat after she clearly said she couldn't and didn't want to care for it. Then, due to this, as well as your reaction, exacerbate her mental health state and say she \"has to deal\". I feel bad for her.", "YTA you think you understand depression but it seems like you don\u2019t. She tried to tell you but you guilted her into agreeing to something she knew she wouldn\u2019t be able to handle.", "YTA\n\nAlso, the fact that you're holding your \"favors\" over her shows me that you didn't do those things to be kind and helpful but to hold something over her. Which, especially as you're 22 dating someone 18, gives me some inkling to the dynamic yall have.\n\nAnd the fact you bulldozed her first response and continually pushed her until she said yes?? You're a walking red flag, dude.\n\nAnyways, I hope she realizes what a shit partner you are and leaves you!\n\nEdit: also it's so funny that you're talking about how \"you understand depression\" but Lisa's depression \"gets out of control\" like??? That's the whole thing about depression????", "\ntake this as an example:\n> \"hey can you hold this book for me\"\n\n> \"hey man I love you but I am holding a lot of stuff and will drop your book\"\n\n>\"if you asked me to do it I would hold your book\" [holding nothing but the single book]\n\n>\"fine\"\n[falls and drops everything]\n\n>\"HOW DARE YOU DROP MY BOOK\"", "Yeah dude that's on you\n\n- girl tells you she can't take care of cat\n- you drop cat off anyway\n- didn't like the bathroom rule, but also didn't care enough to find a better solution\n- then get mad when things go about as well as they could have, going by what you wrote\n\n\"I understand depression\" no you don't\n\nYou abandoned your cat and gave it to someone who flat out _told you_ they weren't up to the task. Poor kitty deserves a better owner\n\n YTA", "YTA she said no because she knew she wouldn't be able to take care of the cat properly, you guilted her into doing it anyway, she didn't take care of the cat properly, and now you're mad. You owe her an apology. Next time someone says no, accept it as their answer.", "YTA. She declined to watch your cat.  You knew she wasn't feeling up to it, but you forced it on her and then have the audacity to judge her for not taking care of your cat to your standards.  While I feel sorry for your cat, YTA for putting it in that situation.", "YTA. She told you she wasn\u2019t up to it, and you didn\u2019t listen. I hope Lisa has a good think about your behavior. And poor Cloud didn\u2019t have his human truly looking out for him. If someone says no to taking care of a living creature, you listen and find someone else.", "YTA. \n\n< Asks gf to watch cat\n\n< GF says no\n\n< Gives her cat anyways\n\n< Surprised Pikachu when she didn't watch the cat well\n\nAlso just your general disregard for your girlfriend's feelings, the fact that you guilt tripped her, and were unwilling to take no for an answer is a major \ud83d\udea9", "YTA. She said no, your coerced her into doing it anyway. Do you do that a lot? With other things? No wonder she has depression.\nYou sent messages to check on the cat, but not your own girlfriend when you knew she was in alone in a depressive episode.", "So to summarize: you asked, she said no. You fully dismissed the depth and impact of her mental health struggles for your totally rad trip. You brought the cat anyway for her to watch, which, again, she said no to doing. She told you the cat would stay in the bathroom. And now you want to know if she\u2019s the asshole for doing literally what she said would do which went as badly as she said it would go when you originally asked her AND SHE SAID NO. \n\nINFO: Can you not afford a pet sitter? Do you not have any mentally well, pet loving friends? Or have you trampled everyone else\u2019s boundaries to the point that no one else would help you without literally forcing them to? \n\nYeah, YTA without any ambiguity.", "YTA\n\nBased on the title, I had assumed you asked and she said yes, but that's not what happened. You asked an 18 year old girl to cat-sit for you and she told you she could barely take care of her self. The neglect in on your part not her, because she was upfront about not being able to care for the cat, but you gave her the cat to care for anyways.  \n\nAnd damn, how badly did you yell at your \"girlfriend\" (I think she's dumping you by the way) for her roommate to get upset with you.", "YTA because you didn't take no for an answer. She had serious doubts about whether she would be able to take care of your cat in the first place, but you made her do it anyway. You could have used a professional pet sitter or something when she said no.", "YTA - she didn\u2019t want to take care of your cat and was clear it\u2019d be a burden. You pushed until she caved, despite knowing she was struggling. Sure, she didn\u2019t clean the box, but your cat was fed and alive. Next time, take better care of a pet you love by not pushing it on someone who has to be coerced into their care. There are always pet sitters and kennels you can pay.", ">Me and some of my friends have been planning on going on a week-long road trip for a while now\n\nwhy didn't you plan for cat-sitting services??\n\nWhy did you think your gf HAD to take our cat?\n\nYTA You bullied her into taking the cat after she said no. You failed to even consider a reliable sitter. You failed your cat. You failed your gf too.\n\nYou two should break up. She deserves someone who is more supportive, and your cat deserves someone who putscat least five minutes of thought into their care when they're planning a week long vacation.", "YTA. She initially said she didn't want to take care of the cat and you guilted her into it. You need to understand what severe depression can do to people. Sometimes it gets to the point where a person can barely function. You don't understand depression. Yes, YTA.", "YTA she tried telling you she wasn't feeling up to looking after him. Ultimately you were responsible for mkaing sure he was adequately cared for. You could have left him in a cattery or arranged a professional cat sitter, instead you browbeat a mentally unstable person into keeping him against her will and agreed to him being kept in a bathroom for a week. This is on you dude.", "YTA. Your 18 year old girlfriend said no. End of story.", "YTA\n\nYou knew your girlfriend was not a capable pet sitter. You were well aware she could not care for herself properly due to her depression. She told you multiple times *that she could not care for your cat*. Instead of accepting this, you pressured and bullied her into taking the cat, then dumped your cat on her.\n\nNo, Lisa was not \"the only person who could watch him.\" You could have boarded the cat at a licensed facility. You could have paid for a pet sitter.\n\nYou should be ashamed of yourself for leaving your cat in an unsafe situation because you are too cheap and lazy to arrange proper boarding.", "YTA - You said you've done so many favors and you would've helped her if she was in your position. **Except you're not in her position**. You do not have depression or a debilitating illness.\n\nWhat you were doing was like trying to force someone with a broken arm to carry stuff for you after you helped them carry their stuff. If you want to be transactional, at least use logic.\n\nBut it seems the core of the problem is that you don't take your girlfriend's depression seriously because of your ignorance of mental illness.", "YTA. She told you she was already having a difficult enough time taking herself as it is and didn't want to be responsible for caring for something else on top of that, and you pretty much guilted her into caring for the cat anyway.\n\nThrusting the responsibility of caring for a pet on a person who doesn't want that responsibility in the first place doesn't generally have a good outcome.", "YTA for not taking no for an answer when she said she didn\u2019t want to take care of something else. That\u2019s on you. You guilted her into it.", "YTA.\n\nYou knowingly left your cat with someone who flat out told you they weren\u2019t able to take care of your cat, and had a perfectly valid reason to do so, but eventually agreed because you bullied her into it.\n\nAnd then you have the audacity to blame her when the cat doesn\u2019t get 100 per cent fastidious care?\n\nOf course the cat was miserable. You left her in a bad situation.\n\nYou\u2019re right though, people need to deal with the consequences of their actions. Ie, your gf dumps you and your cat hocks up a hair ball into one of your shoes and you don\u2019t know it until you put it on.", "YTA. I guess I missed the part where leaving your cat with someone not even capable of caring for themselves is not neglect on YOUR part. And it doesn't sound like you \"understand depression\" at all.", "YTA\nyour cat is your responsibility. what I mean by that is, if you are to let someone watch your cat while you're away, you need to be sure they'll take proper care of cloud.\nYour gf had clearly declined to take care of cloud and even said they'll be kept in the bathroom for a whole week. It seems to me you didn't want to put in more effort in finding a better person for this and went with her because \n\n>I've done so many favors and I would've helped her if she was in my position\n\nwhile I do not agree with treating an animal like this at all, I still think you should have put in more thought into leaving your cat with someone who finds it hard to even take care of herself.", "YTA!! It\u2019s your cat dude. Either take responsibility for it or don\u2019t have a pet. You pawned your cat off on someone who said no and then got mad when your cat wasn\u2019t treated like royalty. This is on you.", "YTA\n\nYou guilted your girlfriend, who told you she couldn't do it, into taking care of your cat and you just assumed that she would take care of your cat the way you wanted.", "YTA.\n\nNo is a complete sentence. You should have hired someone to look after your cat. If you can't afford a sitter, don't go on vacation.", "YTA. You pressured her to do it when she was absolutely up front about not being equipped to handle it. You okayed her keeping you cat I t he bathroom, which is cruel, and ON YOU. You absolutely knew she was in no place to handle this- she TOLD you she couldn\u2019t handle it. You\u2019re the one who put your cat at risk. You should have respected your girlfriend\u2019s request and made alternate arrangements.", "So she said no and you brought the cat over anyway...yep YTA", "YTA\n\nShe told you she was unable to take care of the cat due to her emotion and mental state. \n\nYou didn't listen. Don't blame her. She told you she couldn't and you bulldozed her.", "Dude, don\u2019t leave your cat with someone who specifically told you they don\u2019t want to take care of your cat. You don\u2019t just dump a living creature YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR on somebody.\n\nShould she have taken better care? Yes, but she also TOLD YOU from the beginning that she was having a hard time taking care of herself much less another creature. Mental health struggles are real and she is aware of hers. YOU were the one decided your cat was not worth finding someone able and willing to care for the cat properly. \n\nYTA", "She lives in a dorm dude\u2026 If i had to take care of my now cat in my freshman dorm i\u2019d be miserable!! Are you out of college? and she\u2019s fresh outta highschool? How long have you been dating?? four year age gap isn\u2019t bad inherently but it seems like you\u2019re at two very different places in life", "YTA for guilt tripping and forcing her to watch Cloud when she refused. You should have respected her decision, and she should dump you.\n\nShe's also a SMALL A H for how she treated Cloud, but you should have NEVER put her in that position, and she would TOTALLY be an A H but you shouldn't have done this to Cloud. \n\nEdit: Yes, she should dump you. Also, why the fuck are you dating an 18 year old?", "Oh my, let's break this down:\n\n* You were trying to get this road trip going \"for a while now,\" but didn't think to ask your GF during that time if she could commit to watching the cat.\n* You \"understand depression\" but then *at every damn step in this story* demonstrate that you don't.\n* The entire justification here for dropping a live animal (that you theoretically care about) on your unwilling GF's doorstep seems to be that she... owes you. \n\nWhat about those other friends that \"had their own things going on\"? Are their commitments more important than your GF's struggle with depression? Did it occur to you to look into a pet hotel or any pet boarding solution?\n\nThis should end your relationship, full stop. It's pretty obvious you don't respect her. But, given that she seems to struggle with boundaries and her own self-worth I worry that she'll let things linger.\n\n**YTA**", "YTA because she essentially tried to tell you this would happen", "YTA. My sister and brother-in-law have a cat that may have to be boarded when they go on trips because he shows extreme fear aggression around other cats (except for the other cat that he lives with of course), and the 2 families that could watch him have cats. Your gf was not in the right frame of mind to be cat-sitting. You should have boarded your cat the second she said no.", "YTA. Your (hopefully EX) girlfriend TOLD you she didn't feel like she could properly take care of Cloud, and you STILL brought Cloud to her dorm for her to take care of. You were completely insensitive to both your gf's needs and Cloud's needs. Next time, board your cat or find someone else to take care of her. (Side note: on top of everything else, your gf could well have gotten in trouble for having a pet in the dorm, and you could have come home to your cat being at a shelter.)", "YTA - you asked someone to look after your cat, someone who was convenient but who had a severe medical condition and was barely coping. She said no, she couldn't manage. She understood her limitations but you decided you knew better and she owed you. So you browbeat her into accepting care of your cat because you were dismissive of her mental health condition. You brought your cat over and she gave you red flags which you dismissed.\n\nAnd lo and behold, she was right about her limits. She tried but if she can't look after herself, she couldn't look after a cat. And you screamed at her for being a failure when you set her up to fail. \n\nYou are a bad cat owner and a bad friend. And in your own words, \"sometimes you have to deal with the consequences of their own fucking actions\" and the only thing she really did wrong was \"kiss your ass\" and give in when she knew it was a bad idea. \n\nNext time, find someone who wants to look after your cat not someone you guilt into it even though they are telling you they can't cope. If you can't respect her illness and self knowledge, then maybe best to stay away. \n\nHope Cloud is ok. And his bowl was nearly empty, not empty so she had been doing her best to look after him. Bowl would have no food in at all otherwise.", "YTA. Next time someone says they can't take care of your cat, take no for an answer. What happened to Cloud is your fault.", "YTA\n\nShe refused  You kept whining and guilt tripping til she felt obligated to do it, then you screamed at her when she was unable to properly care for the cat?  She told you she couldn't do it! It's your responsibility to find PROPER care for your pet.", "YTA. she didn\u2019t not quickly agree to watch your cat, then neglect him. she said no and you pressured her into it anyways. she knew she wouldn\u2019t be able to care for him right. yes, his bowl should\u2019ve been filled and the litterbox should\u2019ve been cleaned, but she TOLD YOU that she was depressed and couldn\u2019t handle another thing on her plate, yet you dumped your cat on her anyway because you were too lazy to find a proper cat sitter who would\u2019ve given him what he needs. you owe her a huge apology, and don\u2019t be surprised if she decides to leave you over this.", "YTA- she said no AND claiming she\u2019s the only one isn\u2019t true. Pet sitters and boarding are available options. You chose to leave Cloud with someone who said she could not care for Cloud.", "YTA .. You saw the signs of depression. She told you no. It\u2019s your own fault.", "YTA.\n\nYou asked your gf to watch Cloud, she said no, and you abandoned him with her anyway. \n\n(I'm in no way excusing her neglect of Cloud. That's a whole other issue and I say this as someone who has depression. There is no excuse for neglecting a living being that depends on you for care.)\n\nBut when she told you she couldn't take care of him *that meant she couldn't take care of him.* That wasn't permission to dump him on her anyway.\n\nCloud is *your* responsibility. If you couldn't find anyone to care for him properly while you were away, then you shouldn't have gone on your trip. If you aren't willing to give him the priority he deserves, then you should rehome him with someone who will put his well-being first. \n\nYou should also end it with Lisa. Depression doesn't just magically go away. There is no pulling yourself up by your bootstraps out of it. If you can't handle being with someone who has it and all of the inconveniences that having a mental illness will inevitably cause to whatever lifestyle you want to have, then you need to be honest with her and go your separate ways, not try to force her to get over it just because you think how she's dealing with things is \"out of proportion\" to how you would.", "YTA.\n\nYou like claim many thing but you shown you're just ignorant or dismal what actually is depression. She said no, she gave CLEAR reason why it was a bad idea.\n\nYou had to GUILT a mentally ill 18 years old to take on a duty she was strongly against. Then had the balls to think you know what was her best was?\n\nWe certainly know your best is not much.\n\nCouldn't look beyond your GF for help? Dont have any other friends you can trust or you just didn't have guilt ammo to use against them? Couldn't look into cat sitting services? Couldn't do much more than lean on someone who can barely keep themselves up. That was your best it seems.", "YTA, she was upfront about her inability to properly care for your cat. You bullied her into it. \n\nAlso, a dorm doesn't sound like a good environment for a cat, even taking away the fact that she kept Cloud in the bathroom all week. Your cat was probably miserable because he was in an unfamiliar environment with people he didn't know. Next time, pay for someone to go to your place to care for your cat, he'll be much happier.", "YTA. You clearly don\u2019t understand depression nor do you have any empathy for your (hopefully ex) girlfriend. No is a complete sentence. Look into companies like pawshake next time you travel.", "YTA. She refused because she knew her limitations. You clearly haven\u2019t bothered to actually understand depression and what it can entail and basically guilted and forced her into taking your cat. Even though she told you she knew she couldn\u2019t do it. You reaped what you sowed at the expense of an innocent creature.  While I don\u2019t think she did the right thing either, you\u2019re definitely the bigger AH here.", "YTA. She said she did not want to watch the cat because she was struggling to care for herself. You pressured her into it, and are mad at her for it? She was clear she didn't want the responsibility. It's YOUR responsible to find suitable accommodation for your pet when you travel. This wasn't it, and she told you so but you made her watch the cat anyways.", "You said that you understand depression, but clearly you don\u2019t. She was trying to communicate to you the whole time what she was capable of and you didn\u2019t believe her. She set the boundaries, you pushed and ignored them. She then set up your expectations by saying that she would keep him in the bathroom and again you agreed. Then, when she did what she could you gave her crap? You shouldn\u2019t be surprised. \nAlso, you say that it pissed you off because you do her favors all the time and would have helped in her position. You forget that 1) favors aren\u2019t transactions, and 2) even if she did ask you it wouldn\u2019t be equivalent unless you had depression. \nListen to people when they tell you what they can and cannot do for you, and don\u2019t do \u201cfavors\u201d if you expect something in return. If you can\u2019t handle dating a depressed person then simply don\u2019t. \nYTA", "YTA. Why didn\u2019t you respect her statement to begin with? She said no because she can\u2019t take care of herself let alone an animal. You do not know what mental illness/depression is. This is your own fault for insisting she take care of the cat.", "YTA. She told you no. Why did you bring your cat over anyway?", "YTA she told you she wasn\u2019t up to it mentally and your forced her to do it.", "YTA. YOU left YOUR cat with someone who told you they did not feel well enough to take care of it. YOU felt uncomfortable with the situation, and still chose to move forward and push this task on your gf. If you cared about your cat or your gf\u2019s mental health, you would have figured out other arrangements.", "YTA\n\nYou should have hired cat sitter. Cats much better at their own place and saving 100 bucks does not worth all that problem forcing gf in something she can't do.\n\nYou should deal with consequences of your actions, you caused pain to your cat ( you agreed to keep him locked in bathroom? you are shitty owner ) and your gf.\n\nhuge AH.", "YTA.  She said she couldn\u2019t do it and you inexplicably still forced her and then entrusted the care of your animal to someone who said they were overwhelmed by the task.   You basically set her up.  If someone told me their mental health issues would make it difficult for them to care for my pet, I would find someone else to help or not go on my trip.  You are ultimately responsible for the situation with your cat.", "YTA. There's a service called pet sitting. Pay for it. Browbeating someone and then dumping your pet on them is not responsible pet ownership.", "Listen, what she did was bad but YTA. You guilted her into taking responsibility for an animal that she communicated to you that she wasn\u2019t comfortable with. She was open and honest with you that her depression is really bad, you could have found another option. She told you she wasn\u2019t capable, so why are you surprised?", "There's this thing called a boarding kennel. Try it. YTA.", "YTA", "YTA.\nShe said no and you forced her.\n\nyou keep saying you understand depression I really don't think you do...

I also have a cat named Cloud.\n\nMe and some of my friends have been planning on going on a week-long road trip for a while now, and we finally found a day when all of us would be free.\n\nI called Lisa as soon as we found a date and asked her if she would be able to watch Cloud. My family lives out of state, and most of my other friends had their own things going on. Lisa was the only person who could watch him. \n\nLisa has been dealing with depression for a while, which I get is hard and I've tried to be very supportive. It causes her to have a lack of motivation to do things, which I understand but unfortunately, there are times when it gets way out of proportion.\n\nAs soon as I asked Lisa, she immediately refused. She said she doesn't need something else to take care of when she's apparently having trouble taking care of herself. I did understand, but it made me kinda pissed because I've done so many favors and I would've helped her if she was in my position, but when I brought that up a few times she agreed.\n\nDay of the road trip, I brought Cloud over to her dorm, and she immediately made a rule that Cloud had to stay in the bathroom. I was uncomfortable with this and didn't complain. I also brought Cloud's food and litterbox.\n\nAnyways, me and my friends went on the trip, had a blast, and I checked in on how Cloud was doing a few times, to which Lisa would reply 'Fine' too. \n\nLast night, I came back and drove over to pick up Cloud. \n\nWhen I came and Lisa let me in, she had a guilty look on her face which made me really suspicious. I ran to the bathroom and opened the door, and I was just fucking disgusted. Cloud's litterbox was filthy, and their bowl was nearly empty. Plus, Cloud in general looked miserable. \n\nI turned around and asked her what the fuck was the meaning of this, and she burst into tears and said she did her best to care of him. I yelled at her and said if she was doing her best, she wouldn't have let Cloud live in his own shit and fed him. She tried insisting she has been feeding him, but I wouldn't have it. I took Cloud and his stuff and left without another word. I understand depression, but I know I would never neglect someone I love's animal no matter how hard shit got for me.\n\nWhen I got home, their roommate sent me a long-ass text basically calling me a piece of shit for what I said to Lisa, and that I 'caused her to spiral'. And I texted back that sometimes she has to deal with the consequences of her own fucking actions and not everyone is going to kiss her ass 24/7.\n\nMe and Lisa haven't talked since all that's happened. I don't think I was wrong for what I said, but I also don't want this to end our relationship entirely either. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
