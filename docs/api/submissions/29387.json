So I ask her if she's been living on fast food instead of actually eating healthy which she always talks about.

She's now mad at me because I'm no longer buying maybe groceries and I'm also not speaking to her. AITAH?\n\nUpdate: I'm broken.

Well, NTA for not wanting to make your wife lunch anymore.\n\nBut any particular reason you won't continue getting groceries?? Even if she won't eat lunches from you, she needs breakfasts and dinners, right?? \n\nI find it kind of... odd, that your focus was on \"are you eating healthy\" instead of, \"Wait, were you lying to me about wasting food?\" which seems to be the *way* more significant issue.\n\nI agree with others that something else seems to be going on. Throwing away a glass container is overboard - if she was desperate to hide it, she could have been giving her lunch to someone else/scraping it into the trash instead of dumping the whole thing?\n\nAnd lying about something so obviously, easily provable, just in general?
