Same with your grandchildren, the money they receive doesn\u2019t belong to your son.", "NTA. But I think the fundamental issue is that you both view an inheritance from you differently.  \n\nI think she's seeing this as, how much is she getting and how much are her brothers getting? But the point of the inheritance from you is not to make things equal between your sons and your daughter. \n\nThe point of this inheritance is to help future generations. There are no future generations coming from her, so she doesn't get extra money. \n\nIf I were you discussing this with her, I would avoid getting sidetracked into discussions about how her brothers are getting more, how unfair it is, etc. \n\nEvery time she tries, bring it back to the core point of the inheritance, which is concerned with supporting future generations. \n\nTurn the tables on her. Ask her, was it unfair for her grandparents to give her money? Should you ask her and her brother to give that inheritance back to you? Does it not make sense to ensure that future children are cared for? Etc.\n\nEdited to add: If she believes Earth will be overpopulated, doesn't it make more sense to ensure future generations are properly provided for?", "NTA. That is a matter for you and your partner only. Your children should be thankful for getting anything in the first place when they are really entitled to nothing.", "NTA, she has 0 power over how you split your inheritance. Seems like you're trying to split it equally based on how your parents have done, which makes you kind of a nice person not making your decision based on how much you like a certain child. It's her decision not to have children, she's already been granted a privileged start of life and she needs the money less than your grandchildren. She's the AH for trying to take what you want to give to someone else.", "NTA, one bit. Your money your choice. She is getting what 100% she is entitled to, nothing less. Even if her \"children\" were to get money, she wouldn't get any of it. She's absolutely entitled.", "Nta\n\nShe is essentially trying to double dip by saying she won\u2019t have kids and therefore should get more.", "NTA. You are not depriving her of anything. She is getting the exact same thing either way.  Can I ask if the trust's cover adopted children and stepkids?", "NTA, at the end of the day its your money and you can do anything with your money  \nyour children is not entitled for any of it and the fact she will be getting 5 grand from you  \nis already more than you can give her", "NTA. She's asking for money that she wouldn't get anyway if she had children. This isn't hard to understand.", "NTA. It seems that she hasn\u2019t properly appreciated that future hypothetical adult children are not an extension of herself. Also how old is she? I only ask as I do know other women who said they\u2019d never have children it went on to do so.", "NTA. Does she think her nieces and nephews are going to give a share of their inheritances to their parents? I doubt it. She's being treated quite fairly, and even if she weren't, it's your decision.", "Info: how much more money would the grandchildren get vs what she got from her grandma?\n\nPresumably she received a large cash sum from her grandma and having children or not wouldn\u2019t change that position vs her siblings, it\u2019s more jealousy of the younger generation. Possibly justified if they would be receiving substantially more otherwise it\u2019s just greed from her.", "NTA, you are free to leave whatever YOU decide to whoever. What your siblings leave for their children is their own choice just as much as it is yours.", "NTA your money your choice how you leave it to people. But sounds like she would challenge your will when you pass.", "I will go with NTA, but I see that there's a disconnect in your perspectives. \n\nFrom what you have set out, it sounds like your daughter views the inheritance in terms of family sub-units ie your daughter (and any children she may decide to have) as one sub-unit, whereas her brother (and his existing and any future kids) as another sub-unit. Therefore from that perspective, the more kids you have, the greater the share you would have in the overall pool if you have more people in the sub-unit.\n\nOn the other hand, where you're coming from is to view the family in generational \"layers\", ie your children as one layer to preserve the memories, the grandchildren as one layer to preserve the wealth. I admire your family's foresight to protect the next generation's ability to make a comeback even if an adverse circumstance were to occur to the generation above. \n\nBecause this is a trust and not a will, I would suggest that you sit everyone down and explain the perspectives and mechanics of how the trust is supposed to work and address their concerns on a fundamental level. You might also want to separately try to speak to your daughter again to explain where you're coming from. This would hopefully avoid disputes in future as to the operation of the trust to frustrate your good intentions.", "NTA. Your money, your will.", "NTA. It's kind of an old fashioned way of doing things, but you aren't the first.  She doesn't seem to understand that \"neices and nephews getting more\" isn't the same as \"I'm getting less\". She doesn't seem to be worried about how unfair it would be for her to receive much more money than her brothers.\n\nIt's your money, you can do whatever you want with it. She chose not to have children so she shouldn't care about generational wealth.", "NTA and there is no logic in her request. There are two inheritances you get, one trustfund as a grandchild, and personal belongings/small amount of money as a child. Her wanting another trustfund is greedy, against the family tradition and unfair to her siblings. As others have pointed out, the trust fund would be her kids and she would not have access to the money. And for her to see money her hypothetical kids would get as her own, shows what kind of mother she would\u2018ve been.\n\nKeep holding on to your tradition!", "NTA. You could leave ALL your money to retired circus monkeys if you so decided. It is your money your \"rules\".", "I can see both sides of this. You are not the AH here tho. She doesn\u2019t get to decide what other people do with their money. \n\nYour daughter already inherited her amount. She can\u2019t also collect money for kids that she doesn\u2019t have for herself. \n\nI feel like you are doing the right thing and if she loves family more than money, she will understand this in the future.", "NTA and she's just being greedy and trying to use her feminism to manipulate you. Her logic is completely flawed for the reasons you explained. The only hypothetical people missing out on anything are her non-existent children. Her siblings are getting the same amount and she received her grandchild amount already so WTF does that have to do with the patriarchy? This coming from someone who sees the effects of our patriarchal society in almost anything. The only way she could play that card would be if your children received a personal inheritance based on how many children they had. Kinda curious how old she is because she sounds a bit immature still.", "NTA, inheritance really is one of those things where the person leaving the inheritance has the right to do basically whatever they want.\n\nIn your case, inheritance essentially skips a generation.  Your daughter already got a trust fund from her grandparents, just like her siblings did, so she wasn't excluded from anything. There are no grandchildren to inherit anything, so it makes perfect sense that no trusts are set up.\n\nIt's sort of strange that she would want anything, because if they were set up for her kids she wouldn't get any of that money either \u2013 her kids would. It's not like she would take that money from them, I hope. Your system is a little unorthodox but completely fair.\n\nMaybe you could set up some provision in case she changes her mind and does have kids? It's not really necessary but it might make her feel included, though it feels a bit overcomplicated and might lead to legal issues.", "\"It's a tradition\" is not a good reason in itself\n\nDo you actually think that this is the fairest thing to do, or the thing that will bring you the most happiness, or the thing that will result in your family all having a good relationship?", "NTA.\n\nYou should go back to her and thank her for deciding not to become a mother.", "NTA. Seems patriarchal to expect an inheritance", "Well if she is a smart girl she could always take control over your finances while you are alive. Courts are very willing to grant that power to kids.\n\nBefore you know it you are locked in a nursing home.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That way young generations can have a good start in life.

The estate is divided equally amongst grandkids and not amongst \u201cfamilies\u201d.

Screw tradition. Is he screwing over the grandkids by doing this so they would get less? It\u2019s your money and you can do what you want, but your daughter can\u2019t guarantee at this age that she\u2019ll never have children.", "NTA is your money though I can see where your daughter is coming from", "NTA\n\nInheritance isn't a right.\n\nBut... there is an issue with this. Ehat if a grandkids is born after the grandparents pass away. In this case, they get nothing then.", "INFO: So... why isn't your daughter getting your parents' money?

If so, maybe you can create a much much smaller trust, which she can use for medical care for her pets", "NTA. It's really not any more complicated than this. Money left to her children would not have been her money. BTW, the Bronfman fortune was/is set up in exactly the same way as this.", "She is already getting more money by not having kids.

The trust's are set up for any grandchildren who exist while the grandparents are alive. There is a family trust that sets up trusts for any grandchildren born afterwards but it has rarely been used.", "It is more or less the same if you account for inflation.  It's enough to pay for a university education and have a good start on life.  One of my cousins got a doctorate and then went to work for a non profit since they would not have to worry about having to support a family on his salary.", "Yeah but even then it's in no way justified because you inherit based the assets the person who passes has to give you.

OP might conclude that it a fair thing to do in the circumstances. Now consider whether \"fairness\" is the absolute guiding principle or whether \"family harmony while I'm alive\" might be also an important factor. Two choices move be similar on the fairness axis but very different in the happiness axis. \n\nAnd you might not want to go calling people \"fellow\". I'm sure you intend to sound jovial and like a mug of mead is on offer, but it also sounds as if you think everyone is a man.", "I agree. She is making a perfectly reasonable and probably quite good choice.\n\nIf she cannot understand the seperate nature of children from their parents...it is for the best.", "It is indeed mean. I was only halfway serious. Yes, because it's the truth. No, because it won't help her or anyone else.", "So if it\u2019s a generation skipping trust though, while the trusts assets may only go to the grandkids for whom it was set up for, it\u2019s pretty common for any income generated by the trust assets to go to benefit the \u201cskipped\u201d generation - in this case that would mean op\u2019s kids that had grandkids are all benefitting from the income generated by the assets of the next generation\u2019s trusts tax free. But op\u2019s daughter doesn\u2019t actually get this same semi regular income benefit that the children that went and had kids do get. This might be a negligible amount that barely covers the cost of raising kids but given how organized and regular op\u2019s family is with this process it\u2019s probably a pretty penny.\n\nIf op\u2019s family trusts are set up in this manner then the daughter does kind of have a point. It\u2019s unclear though - just a major point I think a lot of people are missing", "Not always. And even then, that money is meant to support the children. She doesn\u2019t have the extra cost of raising children; she doesn\u2019t need child support.", "Considering options is a good idea, yes, though I personally wouldn\u2019t as all the daughter seems to want is more money herself.\n\nFamily harmony would probably kept alive by keeping \u201ctraditions\u201d alive, as that will make the older gens happy and most of everyone, except for the daughter \n\nFellow is a gender-neutral word, which is why I choose to use it in conversations.
