Same with your grandchildren, the money they receive doesn\u2019t belong to your son.", "NTA. But I think the fundamental issue is that you both view an inheritance from you differently.  \n\nI think she's seeing this as, how much is she getting and how much are her brothers getting? But the point of the inheritance from you is not to make things equal between your sons and your daughter. \n\nThe point of this inheritance is to help future generations. There are no future generations coming from her, so she doesn't get extra money. \n\nIf I were you discussing this with her, I would avoid getting sidetracked into discussions about how her brothers are getting more, how unfair it is, etc. \n\nEvery time she tries, bring it back to the core point of the inheritance, which is concerned with supporting future generations. \n\nTurn the tables on her. Ask her, was it unfair for her grandparents to give her money? Should you ask her and her brother to give that inheritance back to you? Does it not make sense to ensure that future children are cared for? Etc.\n\nEdited to add: If she believes Earth will be overpopulated, doesn't it make more sense to ensure future generations are properly provided for?", "NTA. That is a matter for you and your partner only. Your children should be thankful for getting anything in the first place when they are really entitled to nothing.", "NTA, she has 0 power over how you split your inheritance. Seems like you're trying to split it equally based on how your parents have done, which makes you kind of a nice person not making your decision based on how much you like a certain child. It's her decision not to have children, she's already been granted a privileged start of life and she needs the money less than your grandchildren. She's the AH for trying to take what you want to give to someone else.", "NTA, one bit. Your money your choice. She is getting what 100% she is entitled to, nothing less. Even if her \"children\" were to get money, she wouldn't get any of it. She's absolutely entitled.", "Nta\n\nShe is essentially trying to double dip by saying she won\u2019t have kids and therefore should get more.", "NTA. You are not depriving her of anything. She is getting the exact same thing either way.  Can I ask if the trust's cover adopted children and stepkids?", "NTA, at the end of the day its your money and you can do anything with your money  \nyour children is not entitled for any of it and the fact she will be getting 5 grand from you  \nis already more than you can give her", "NTA. She's asking for money that she wouldn't get anyway if she had children. This isn't hard to understand.", "NTA. It seems that she hasn\u2019t properly appreciated that future hypothetical adult children are not an extension of herself. Also how old is she? I only ask as I do know other women who said they\u2019d never have children it went on to do so.", "NTA. Does she think her nieces and nephews are going to give a share of their inheritances to their parents? I doubt it. She's being treated quite fairly, and even if she weren't, it's your decision.", "Info: how much more money would the grandchildren get vs what she got from her grandma?\n\nPresumably she received a large cash sum from her grandma and having children or not wouldn\u2019t change that position vs her siblings, it\u2019s more jealousy of the younger generation. Possibly justified if they would be receiving substantially more otherwise it\u2019s just greed from her.", "NTA, you are free to leave whatever YOU decide to whoever. What your siblings leave for their children is their own choice just as much as it is yours.", "NTA your money your choice how you leave it to people. But sounds like she would challenge your will when you pass.", "I will go with NTA, but I see that there's a disconnect in your perspectives. \n\nFrom what you have set out, it sounds like your daughter views the inheritance in terms of family sub-units ie your daughter (and any children she may decide to have) as one sub-unit, whereas her brother (and his existing and any future kids) as another sub-unit. Therefore from that perspective, the more kids you have, the greater the share you would have in the overall pool if you have more people in the sub-unit.\n\nOn the other hand, where you're coming from is to view the family in generational \"layers\", ie your children as one layer to preserve the memories, the grandchildren as one layer to preserve the wealth. I admire your family's foresight to protect the next generation's ability to make a comeback even if an adverse circumstance were to occur to the generation above. \n\nBecause this is a trust and not a will, I would suggest that you sit everyone down and explain the perspectives and mechanics of how the trust is supposed to work and address their concerns on a fundamental level. You might also want to separately try to speak to your daughter again to explain where you're coming from. This would hopefully avoid disputes in future as to the operation of the trust to frustrate your good intentions.", "NTA. Your money, your will.", "NTA. It's kind of an old fashioned way of doing things, but you aren't the first.  She doesn't seem to understand that \"neices and nephews getting more\" isn't the same as \"I'm getting less\". She doesn't seem to be worried about how unfair it would be for her to receive much more money than her brothers.\n\nIt's your money, you can do whatever you want with it. She chose not to have children so she shouldn't care about generational wealth.", "NTA and there is no logic in her request. There are two inheritances you get, one trustfund as a grandchild, and personal belongings/small amount of money as a child. Her wanting another trustfund is greedy, against the family tradition and unfair to her siblings. As others have pointed out, the trust fund would be her kids and she would not have access to the money. And for her to see money her hypothetical kids would get as her own, shows what kind of mother she would\u2018ve been.\n\nKeep holding on to your tradition!", "NTA. You could leave ALL your money to retired circus monkeys if you so decided. It is your money your \"rules\".", "I can see both sides of this. You are not the AH here tho. She doesn\u2019t get to decide what other people do with their money. \n\nYour daughter already inherited her amount. She can\u2019t also collect money for kids that she doesn\u2019t have for herself. \n\nI feel like you are doing the right thing and if she loves family more than money, she will understand this in the future.", "NTA and she's just being greedy and trying to use her feminism to manipulate you. Her logic is completely flawed for the reasons you explained. The only hypothetical people missing out on anything are her non-existent children. Her siblings are getting the same amount and she received her grandchild amount already so WTF does that have to do with the patriarchy? This coming from someone who sees the effects of our patriarchal society in almost anything. The only way she could play that card would be if your children received a personal inheritance based on how many children they had. Kinda curious how old she is because she sounds a bit immature still.", "NTA, inheritance really is one of those things where the person leaving the inheritance has the right to do basically whatever they want.\n\nIn your case, inheritance essentially skips a generation.  Your daughter already got a trust fund from her grandparents, just like her siblings did, so she wasn't excluded from anything. There are no grandchildren to inherit anything, so it makes perfect sense that no trusts are set up.\n\nIt's sort of strange that she would want anything, because if they were set up for her kids she wouldn't get any of that money either \u2013 her kids would. It's not like she would take that money from them, I hope. Your system is a little unorthodox but completely fair.\n\nMaybe you could set up some provision in case she changes her mind and does have kids? It's not really necessary but it might make her feel included, though it feels a bit overcomplicated and might lead to legal issues.", "\"It's a tradition\" is not a good reason in itself\n\nDo you actually think that this is the fairest thing to do, or the thing that will bring you the most happiness, or the thing that will result in your family all having a good relationship?", "NTA.\n\nYou should go back to her and thank her for deciding not to become a mother.", "NTA. Seems patriarchal to expect an inheritance", "Well if she is a smart girl she could always take control over your finances while you are alive.

I was only halfway serious. Yes, because it's the truth. No, because it won't help her or anyone else.", "So if it\u2019s a generation skipping trust though, while the trusts assets may only go to the grandkids for whom it was set up for, it\u2019s pretty common for any income generated by the trust assets to go to benefit the \u201cskipped\u201d generation - in this case that would mean op\u2019s kids that had grandkids are all benefitting from the income generated by the assets of the next generation\u2019s trusts tax free. But op\u2019s daughter doesn\u2019t actually get this same semi regular income benefit that the children that went and had kids do get. This might be a negligible amount that barely covers the cost of raising kids but given how organized and regular op\u2019s family is with this process it\u2019s probably a pretty penny.\n\nIf op\u2019s family trusts are set up in this manner then the daughter does kind of have a point.

Sis actually wants to receive more money than all of her siblings so she is doing some mental gymnastics to justify her greed.\n\nThis system actually makes a lot of sense. It is fair and actually very generous since kids get access to family resources when they are still pretty young. They are also not at the mercy of irresponsible parents and it also doesn't reward or punish family members for having or not having kids.", "This - no one is entitled to an inheritance. It is a gift, a gift to be given however the giver deems fit.", "This is the biggest thing to me. She got the benefit of this system already. It\u2019s a little late to be upset about it now.", "a childless/selfish person shouldn't receive a penny.", "Is that a Brady Bunch reference?", "There's a family trust set up in case kids are born after the grandparent passes. IF she has any kids in the future, they will receive a fund as well. Ops daughter already got her inheritance from her grand mother. She's being greedy.", "But they already got their inheritance, from the grandmother.  OP didn't get money from that go round. Everyone gets money.  It just skips a generation.", "I did not get any money for having children.", "Parents of kids don't get extra money for their kids under this system. The inheritance is the children's money, set up in a trust as the OP describes.", "What\u2019s wrong with it. The kids get a trust from their grandparents and a some items and a token amount from their parents.", "Split between my grandchildren and the family trust.", "WTF, I wish you become a parent and your children the same to you for some petty bucks. \nPeople like you shouldn\u2019t exist.", "Aside from the obvious shitbaggery you\u2019re proposing, the entire point of a trust is that it can\u2019t be messed with.", "Lol courts don't work like that.", "Inheritance - money and/or possessions passed from one person to another on their death.\n\nUniversity - where students go after high school at 18 to get degrees.\n\nFamily - group of people who are connected either legally or by blood and have lived together at one point\n\nTrust - hard to explain but basically money or land managed by one person on behalf of another.\n\nI can see the argument that, by not having children, OPs inheritance will be split 3 ways rather that 4. The brother and his kids will get more as the inheritance is split less ways.  Daughter feels entitled to that 4th share rather than brother and his kids getting 2/3rds of it thanks to her choice.  I don\u2019t think OP is an AH for sticking to the system though.", "Your money.  Do what you want.  Children aren't entitled to anything it's a gift if they get something.  NTA", "[deleted]", "I really like this whole concept! My parents managed to set me up in a similar way, where my education was entirely covered and there was enough extra to eventually allow me to purchase an apartment, and now because I only owe my maintenance, I can work \u00e0 relatively low paying job that I find meaningful, and my gratitude for that freedom is ABSOLUTELY INFINITE!", "Is the amount relatively fixed? I\u2019m curious what happens if Generation A has two grandchildren, but Generation B has five.\n\nWhat will happen with your brother\u2019s grandchildren, if any?", "So is like the 5 grand a typo or something", "The contents of a will should not go to grandchildren in the first place. This is not fair", "A good lawyer I imagine.", "The grandparents provide the trust to the grandchildren.  OP would provide the trust to potential grandchildren.", "The 5grand is what OP is giving her. She received a trust from her grandparents, not OP. And OP is setting up a trust for his grandchildren, just as he did not receive a trust from his own parents, but rather his grandparents.", "No", "Is that not up to the person who is writing the will. If he want he can give all his money away", " Why? How is it not fair?", "Having worked with trusts in one capacity, in the UK, this isn't correct - though the income generated by the assets, whilst the children are still minors, may be used for the **children's** expenses before they get to an age where they can access the assets unchallenged, to inherit outright.\n\nThe living expenses of the children can include the accommodation of the children but with this level of family wealth then the parents will have used the grandparental money to provide that. Nobody in this family is going to be renting. Though some of living expenses for the accommodation will also be covered and since two people can live together for less than the cost of two singles (if you do it right) then their parents might get some minimal help with their living costs. \n\nBut it's all comparatively minor. There has to be at least a 'comfortable' level of wealth in OP's family, to be able to set up significant grandchildren's trusts so early in their own lives, and still live comfortably plus leaving a little for their own children.\n\nOP's ***IS*** giving his children the same: they will have had trusts from his parents and can expect to inherit a minimal amount plus sentimental items when OP & his wife finally die. She doesn't see that as she has worked out that her siblings are getting a greater proportion of the overall family wealth and refuses to acknowledge that the grandchildren are being provided for in those bigger proportion so her own siblings are not really personally benefitting from that extra money going to their branch of the family.\n\nThe daughter has made a socially beneficial decision but making it doesn't entitle *her* to additional money from you. Though maybe you could put additional money into a different trust that is set-up for the specific purpose of environmental issues but which could be converted into a trust for a future grandchild (a lot of people decide not to have kids and stick to that but some people *do* change their minds later). She shouldn't gain access to that trust as trustee until she's at an age where she can't change her mind, and it's base purpose should be firmly set for environmental purposes (or grandchild). So you are supporting her contribution to the future but not effectively changing the family practice - that would be unfair to your other children.", "Op most likely inherited money from his grandparents and he told his daughter that she inherited money from her grandmother. He said that his brother blew his trust fund but his (brother's) kids' money was protected. I think that's a great way to do things. I  wish my Dad would have had a will when he  di. I never knew my grandparents on either side, so I don't know if they had money or not. I was told that when Dad died, between his life insurance and bank account, there was enough money for my brother & I to attend college without needing financial aid. Mom blew all of that money on a new car,  new furniture, and a new wardrobe for her. Because we were both minors, my brother & I had to sign over our Social Security and Veterans benefits to her. When we went to college, we had to get all kinds of financial aid because Mom spent like a ship full of drunken sailors.", "How does it work if the someone generates wealth independent of the trust?  OP said that her daughter\u2019s inheritance from her was $5k. If OP has a job that pays $300k and saved $2m from that job, who gets that $2m when she dies?  Is it added to the trust?", "S op got her own trust from her grandparent\n Her time is done", "Ok I'm saying 5 grand isn't much of a inheritence", "So you can like retire on 5 grand?", "Actually it\u2019s not in most jurisdictions.", "That is an excellent idea. I feel that it would keep the tradition the same and address OPs daughters complaint.", "I would also add provisions for god children or stepchildren \u2013 maybe set a sum aside she can  declare recipients of, like charities.", "You are not entitled to an inheritance 5 grand is better than nothing, plus she already has a trust fund from her grandmother, she is just a greedy trust fund baby.", "That\u2019s from OP - the parent. She already received the larger sum from her grandparents.", "Are you saying that there are limitations on who you can bequeath assets to in a will? \n\nIf so, this is news to me and I have been the executor of a few wills. Since, as executor, I am liable if I do something wrong, I have looked pretty closely into this. \n\nThere are limitations to wills (ie, they cant be inherently illegal) but no limitations as to who the beneficiaries can be.
