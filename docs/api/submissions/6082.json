Same with your grandchildren, the money they receive doesn\u2019t belong to your son.", "NTA. But I think the fundamental issue is that you both view an inheritance from you differently.  \n\nI think she's seeing this as, how much is she getting and how much are her brothers getting? But the point of the inheritance from you is not to make things equal between your sons and your daughter. \n\nThe point of this inheritance is to help future generations. There are no future generations coming from her, so she doesn't get extra money. \n\nIf I were you discussing this with her, I would avoid getting sidetracked into discussions about how her brothers are getting more, how unfair it is, etc. \n\nEvery time she tries, bring it back to the core point of the inheritance, which is concerned with supporting future generations. \n\nTurn the tables on her. Ask her, was it unfair for her grandparents to give her money? Should you ask her and her brother to give that inheritance back to you? Does it not make sense to ensure that future children are cared for? Etc.\n\nEdited to add: If she believes Earth will be overpopulated, doesn't it make more sense to ensure future generations are properly provided for?", "NTA. That is a matter for you and your partner only. Your children should be thankful for getting anything in the first place when they are really entitled to nothing.", "NTA, she has 0 power over how you split your inheritance. Seems like you're trying to split it equally based on how your parents have done, which makes you kind of a nice person not making your decision based on how much you like a certain child. It's her decision not to have children, she's already been granted a privileged start of life and she needs the money less than your grandchildren. She's the AH for trying to take what you want to give to someone else.", "NTA, one bit. Your money your choice. She is getting what 100% she is entitled to, nothing less. Even if her \"children\" were to get money, she wouldn't get any of it. She's absolutely entitled.", "Nta\n\nShe is essentially trying to double dip by saying she won\u2019t have kids and therefore should get more.", "NTA. You are not depriving her of anything. She is getting the exact same thing either way.  Can I ask if the trust's cover adopted children and stepkids?", "NTA, at the end of the day its your money and you can do anything with your money  \nyour children is not entitled for any of it and the fact she will be getting 5 grand from you  \nis already more than you can give her", "NTA. She's asking for money that she wouldn't get anyway if she had children. This isn't hard to understand.", "NTA. It seems that she hasn\u2019t properly appreciated that future hypothetical adult children are not an extension of herself. Also how old is she? I only ask as I do know other women who said they\u2019d never have children it went on to do so.", "NTA. Does she think her nieces and nephews are going to give a share of their inheritances to their parents? I doubt it. She's being treated quite fairly, and even if she weren't, it's your decision.", "Info: how much more money would the grandchildren get vs what she got from her grandma?\n\nPresumably she received a large cash sum from her grandma and having children or not wouldn\u2019t change that position vs her siblings, it\u2019s more jealousy of the younger generation. Possibly justified if they would be receiving substantially more otherwise it\u2019s just greed from her.", "NTA, you are free to leave whatever YOU decide to whoever. What your siblings leave for their children is their own choice just as much as it is yours.", "NTA your money your choice how you leave it to people. But sounds like she would challenge your will when you pass.", "I will go with NTA, but I see that there's a disconnect in your perspectives. \n\nFrom what you have set out, it sounds like your daughter views the inheritance in terms of family sub-units ie your daughter (and any children she may decide to have) as one sub-unit, whereas her brother (and his existing and any future kids) as another sub-unit. Therefore from that perspective, the more kids you have, the greater the share you would have in the overall pool if you have more people in the sub-unit.\n\nOn the other hand, where you're coming from is to view the family in generational \"layers\", ie your children as one layer to preserve the memories, the grandchildren as one layer to preserve the wealth. I admire your family's foresight to protect the next generation's ability to make a comeback even if an adverse circumstance were to occur to the generation above. \n\nBecause this is a trust and not a will, I would suggest that you sit everyone down and explain the perspectives and mechanics of how the trust is supposed to work and address their concerns on a fundamental level. You might also want to separately try to speak to your daughter again to explain where you're coming from. This would hopefully avoid disputes in future as to the operation of the trust to frustrate your good intentions.", "NTA. Your money, your will.", "NTA. It's kind of an old fashioned way of doing things, but you aren't the first.  She doesn't seem to understand that \"neices and nephews getting more\" isn't the same as \"I'm getting less\". She doesn't seem to be worried about how unfair it would be for her to receive much more money than her brothers.\n\nIt's your money, you can do whatever you want with it. She chose not to have children so she shouldn't care about generational wealth.", "NTA and there is no logic in her request. There are two inheritances you get, one trustfund as a grandchild, and personal belongings/small amount of money as a child. Her wanting another trustfund is greedy, against the family tradition and unfair to her siblings. As others have pointed out, the trust fund would be her kids and she would not have access to the money. And for her to see money her hypothetical kids would get as her own, shows what kind of mother she would\u2018ve been.\n\nKeep holding on to your tradition!", "NTA. You could leave ALL your money to retired circus monkeys if you so decided. It is your money your \"rules\".", "I can see both sides of this. You are not the AH here tho. She doesn\u2019t get to decide what other people do with their money. \n\nYour daughter already inherited her amount. She can\u2019t also collect money for kids that she doesn\u2019t have for herself. \n\nI feel like you are doing the right thing and if she loves family more than money, she will understand this in the future.", "NTA and she's just being greedy and trying to use her feminism to manipulate you. Her logic is completely flawed for the reasons you explained. The only hypothetical people missing out on anything are her non-existent children. Her siblings are getting the same amount and she received her grandchild amount already so WTF does that have to do with the patriarchy? This coming from someone who sees the effects of our patriarchal society in almost anything. The only way she could play that card would be if your children received a personal inheritance based on how many children they had. Kinda curious how old she is because she sounds a bit immature still.", "NTA, inheritance really is one of those things where the person leaving the inheritance has the right to do basically whatever they want.\n\nIn your case, inheritance essentially skips a generation.  Your daughter already got a trust fund from her grandparents, just like her siblings did, so she wasn't excluded from anything. There are no grandchildren to inherit anything, so it makes perfect sense that no trusts are set up.\n\nIt's sort of strange that she would want anything, because if they were set up for her kids she wouldn't get any of that money either \u2013 her kids would. It's not like she would take that money from them, I hope. Your system is a little unorthodox but completely fair.\n\nMaybe you could set up some provision in case she changes her mind and does have kids? It's not really necessary but it might make her feel included, though it feels a bit overcomplicated and might lead to legal issues.", "\"It's a tradition\" is not a good reason in itself\n\nDo you actually think that this is the fairest thing to do, or the thing that will bring you the most happiness, or the thing that will result in your family all having a good relationship?", "NTA.\n\nYou should go back to her and thank her for deciding not to become a mother.", "NTA.

No, because it won't help her or anyone else.", "So if it\u2019s a generation skipping trust though, while the trusts assets may only go to the grandkids for whom it was set up for, it\u2019s pretty common for any income generated by the trust assets to go to benefit the \u201cskipped\u201d generation - in this case that would mean op\u2019s kids that had grandkids are all benefitting from the income generated by the assets of the next generation\u2019s trusts tax free. But op\u2019s daughter doesn\u2019t actually get this same semi regular income benefit that the children that went and had kids do get. This might be a negligible amount that barely covers the cost of raising kids but given how organized and regular op\u2019s family is with this process it\u2019s probably a pretty penny.\n\nIf op\u2019s family trusts are set up in this manner then the daughter does kind of have a point.

I don\u2019t understand the idea of \u201cexpecting\u201d? \u201cDemanding\u201d? Inheritance. Go earn your own money", "NAH. This is a really interesting ethical and logical dilemma, and you both have valid points. You make your points clearly, but here\u2019s a way you could frame her position: Essentially, the trusts are set up to support the contributions to future generations that your children make. In the past, these contributions have always been human members of those future generations. Your daughter\u2019s contribution to future generations is to refrain from bringing more humans to an overpopulated planet. She, in essence, is making space and additional resources available for your other kids\u2019 children and all future children with this choice. What she\u2019s saying is, honor that space as you would honor a child because that space matters. \n\nMore importantly, it\u2019s not quite accurate to say that, even if she\u2019d had children, she wouldn\u2019t have gotten any of this trust. Most children take care of their parents eventually, and a trust fund definitely makes it more likely children will, as you say, get off to a good start in life. So your grandchildren will probably be able to take better care of your children in emergency and old age than kids without trust funds can. By not having children, your daughter is forgoing a very real safety net that people create for themselves by having children. When your daughter ages, when her spouse dies, as her friends die, she\u2019ll be entirely on her own. That\u2019s a very real material and emotional sacrifice she\u2019s making. You could see giving her a share of the trust as compensation for that sacrifice, as providing a very small version of the safety net that her children would have been. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s stepping out of tradition as much as you think to honor your daughter\u2019s unselfish choice by giving her one or two grandchildren\u2019s worth of your estate. If you want it to serve only in this safety net capacity, you can arrange that her share will go in a trust that\u2019s only accessible to her in case of a serious health situation or after the age of 65.", "Nta.

And she\u2019s being greedy.", "NTA; it's your money and you get to do with it as you choose. BUT, as a child-free woman, I sympathize with your daughter. The conditions under which your family established its traditions have changed. Back then, the world was not crashing in a fiery spiral of human-caused annihilation, and having more children actually helped a family's economic situation. You have it in your power to start a new tradition that reflects our contemporary realities: rewarding  children who do more than their fair share to look after the planet and their family finances by \\*not\\* having kids.\n\nAn extra bump of cash would also acknowledge that child-free people get dinged in all sorts of ways, including in our careers and finances. We pick up the slack at work when other folks go out on maternity/paternity leave. We do more than our fair share of elder care and kin care. When we get old, it's on us to make sure we've tucked away enough cash for our own care, because we don't have any kids to look after us. And day in, day out, we put up with all sorts of nonsense stereotypes about being barren spinsters, witches, misfits, etc.\n\nAnd so while you are not ethically compelled to cut your daughter a larger chunk of inheritance\u2014once again, it's your money, and you get to do with it as you wish\u2014there are good environmental and economic reasons to do so.", "Nta because your will is your desire.

Other things require consideration - when his aunt got divorced and her ex cleaned her out (excluding the trust) and vanished, the trust paid rent for her and her kids until she stabilized, but she couldn't buy a house with it.\n\nIn another case, his 'uncle' (technically a cousin, but super close family) developed MS young - never going to have kids,  and he needed a lot of assistance and eventually residential care. In that case, the trust was converted to pay his expenses, but everyone of his generation had to agree before the firm would create an 'exception' ... getting 15 people to agree on the use of multiple millions is not an everyday occurrence (this one was easy, but it's the only time in four generations a trust has been repurposed for the recipient's benefit).\n\nIt means that every kid in four generations has got a top-flight education without debt, and had the opportunity to pursue extracurriculars that they were really interested in. It doesn't pay for housing, or cars, or fancy clothes, or trips (with the exception of some school-related things), and I think there's a clause that says if you fail more than 1/4 of the credits required for a degree the trust stops paying until you've passed X courses and then will reimburse after the fact.\n\nBut it let my friend go to medical school without debt; his sister went to law school the same way, and that's a hell of a leg up.", "In American law there is a limit on provisions in a will that extend more than 21 years after the death of the originator.

Why did they do it?", "I really don't understand why some people chooses to be child free.\n\nHave they ever stop and think about who's going to avenge their death if they get murdered?", "This is just a child trying to get more money. Unless she signed over the inheritance she already got to her parents, this is just greed dressed up as 'fair'. \n\nNTA.", "What about children born after their grandparents have died?", "She's TA.", "Sadly, entitlement seems to be a trait of the current generation.  She **has** her inheritance from her grandmother, same as her siblings. Your money doesn't belong to her, it never did, and was never going to. NTA", "But she is not being punished.", "Why?", "She is not being excluded, she received her inheritance same as her siblings.", "Which is the whole point of the system. It was never her money.", "No she doesn't. The major point you're missing you're missing is that she already got hers with the passing of OP's parents (or future passing; doesn't matter). And since she doesn't have kids, she has already theoretically saved far more money. Whether she blew that money or not is beside the point.", "Didn't we settle it that the world is overpopulated with overconsumers? \n\nLike it's not the fault of subsistence farmers who have a bunch of kids, but people who are wealthy enough to have trusts?", "I don't know \u2639\ufe0f sounds like rich people problems. I cannot judge this.", "So here is a novel idea.... OP can do whatever she wants with her money and OPs daughter can do whatever she wants with HER money ... that's how it works. An aging parents accumulated wealth does not equal a payout for their kids upon their death. The daughter with entitlement issues needs to get a grip\n\nNTA", "NTA, and this seems like a current issue with more people choosing to be child free they think they are entitled to more. Now there is more for potential grandchildren. This sounds like a great solid plan, and shes just being greedy", "NTA.", "NTA. But if you wanted to make an offer your daughter might possibly believe to be more \u201cfair,\u201d you could offer to set aside the same amount designated for her nieces\u2019 and nephews\u2019 futures and offer her the opportunity to support future generations by donating it to a charity of her choosing or to create a trust fund for another child of her choice (perhaps a more distant relative\u2019s child, a relative of her significant other, or the child of a friend less well off). You\u2019re, of course, not at all obligated to do this, but she might accept this as a more equitable way to distribute the wealth and allow for the portion that would have gone to her child to also help the next generation.", "I like how you put it, she received money from the grandparents so she and her siblings aren't getting more simply because of having children, it's for the children's future as long as the parents don't guilt trip them or ask to borrow the money.", "NTA. This is where even if you are a religion hating atheist, the parable that Jesus told of the prodigal son can teach us a lot. Your daughter is being extremely disrespectful because she seems more concerned with you being dead than being alive. I would give back the thousands of dollars my grandparents gave me just to spend another day with them. Tell your daughter that you\u2019ve decided to donate her inheritance to her favorite charity.", ">I\u2019d recommend you sell the concept even\n\nGeneration skipping trusts have been a thing for quite a while now.", "Mkay\u2026OP said.\n\nMy point is how common is it... I wouldn\u2019t know, if you do that\u2019s cool to know. Please don\u2019t say pretty common\u2026lol", "There's normally a clause built into the trust if or when the trustees no longer exist, called a dissolution. It's possibly set to donate to charity assuming the last of the progeny die.", "> So essentially her siblings that will have children will get more money for their family unit regardless of who gets it whereas her family UNIT will get less.\n\nMore people get more money, more at 11.", "> If grandparents left a modest inheritance vs a massive inheritance from OP. \n\nFrom what OP says in their comments, the trust has a formula built in to work out inflation, and any additional money goes into the general trust for future grandkids if one is born while the grandparents are gone, and the excesses go to charity.", "That makes sense.", "NTA\n\nLet her know she can hand over the trust from\nGrandma if she doesn\u2019t like the tradition.", "NTA. No one should feel entitled to an inheritance.", "YTA for not raising your daughter right.  Had you raised her properly, she would respect and trust you and wouldn't have this entitled attitude.", "NTA, if she doesn't get it with a sime explanation then use the judge judy paper trick. Makes me laugh everytime watching the cogs turning while she does it.", "More info: if being childfree was not a choice but due to infertility, would you still have the same stance?", "NTA. No one is entitled to your money or an inheritance from you. How you choose to bequeath your money is your choice. It's entirely your decision if you want to ensure the long-term financial stability of your grandchildren.", "NTA\n\nIt is a tradition she was well aware of and already had the benefits. She eceived money from the grandma. \n\nIt is her choice to have kids, but the argument is bull. If you want to have less people force families to have just 1 kid. In 1 generation, you will cut the population in half...\n\nAlso, people with kids do not get more, the kids get their own money. If she has 10 kids, she will still get the same amount.", "Info: Would you consider bequeathing a charitable gift to a charity of her choice in place of what a child of hers would've gotten, if she does remain child free? Do you think this would make her feel any better about the situation?", "Her complaint is invalid. No change necessary. If she actually gave a shit, then why didn't she make that suggestion in the first place? Exactly. She wanted to spoil herself with the inheritance. Her reasoning is an excuse. If she actually cared about overpopulation, she would have been cheering on COVID to take as many old people as possible.\n\nAnd even if she was rooting for COVID, she's going to waste that money on untrustworthy \"efforts,\" as most are scams. If she actually cared, she would train her nieces and nephews and leave them the money as to invest in them being environmentally charged philanthropists who would actually make a difference. Again though, she just wants the money to blow it on herself.", "NTA. I honestly can't really argue with this, you have a working system with a built in fail safe, this is a good way of going about it.", "NTA no one is entitled to inheritance. I will tell her straight up either be grateful for what you have or don\u2019t take it.", "NTA, she should be grateful for whatever she receives. I\u2019ve never inherited anything, and probably never will."]}
