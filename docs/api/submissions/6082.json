Same with your grandchildren, the money they receive doesn\u2019t belong to your son.", "NTA. But I think the fundamental issue is that you both view an inheritance from you differently.  \n\nI think she's seeing this as, how much is she getting and how much are her brothers getting? But the point of the inheritance from you is not to make things equal between your sons and your daughter. \n\nThe point of this inheritance is to help future generations. There are no future generations coming from her, so she doesn't get extra money. \n\nIf I were you discussing this with her, I would avoid getting sidetracked into discussions about how her brothers are getting more, how unfair it is, etc. \n\nEvery time she tries, bring it back to the core point of the inheritance, which is concerned with supporting future generations. \n\nTurn the tables on her. Ask her, was it unfair for her grandparents to give her money? Should you ask her and her brother to give that inheritance back to you? Does it not make sense to ensure that future children are cared for? Etc.\n\nEdited to add: If she believes Earth will be overpopulated, doesn't it make more sense to ensure future generations are properly provided for?", "NTA. That is a matter for you and your partner only. Your children should be thankful for getting anything in the first place when they are really entitled to nothing.", "NTA, she has 0 power over how you split your inheritance. Seems like you're trying to split it equally based on how your parents have done, which makes you kind of a nice person not making your decision based on how much you like a certain child. It's her decision not to have children, she's already been granted a privileged start of life and she needs the money less than your grandchildren. She's the AH for trying to take what you want to give to someone else.", "NTA, one bit. Your money your choice. She is getting what 100% she is entitled to, nothing less. Even if her \"children\" were to get money, she wouldn't get any of it. She's absolutely entitled.", "Nta\n\nShe is essentially trying to double dip by saying she won\u2019t have kids and therefore should get more.", "NTA. You are not depriving her of anything. She is getting the exact same thing either way.  Can I ask if the trust's cover adopted children and stepkids?", "NTA, at the end of the day its your money and you can do anything with your money  \nyour children is not entitled for any of it and the fact she will be getting 5 grand from you  \nis already more than you can give her", "NTA. She's asking for money that she wouldn't get anyway if she had children. This isn't hard to understand.", "NTA. It seems that she hasn\u2019t properly appreciated that future hypothetical adult children are not an extension of herself. Also how old is she? I only ask as I do know other women who said they\u2019d never have children it went on to do so.", "NTA. Does she think her nieces and nephews are going to give a share of their inheritances to their parents? I doubt it. She's being treated quite fairly, and even if she weren't, it's your decision.", "Info: how much more money would the grandchildren get vs what she got from her grandma?\n\nPresumably she received a large cash sum from her grandma and having children or not wouldn\u2019t change that position vs her siblings, it\u2019s more jealousy of the younger generation. Possibly justified if they would be receiving substantially more otherwise it\u2019s just greed from her.", "NTA, you are free to leave whatever YOU decide to whoever. What your siblings leave for their children is their own choice just as much as it is yours.", "NTA your money your choice how you leave it to people. But sounds like she would challenge your will when you pass.", "I will go with NTA, but I see that there's a disconnect in your perspectives. \n\nFrom what you have set out, it sounds like your daughter views the inheritance in terms of family sub-units ie your daughter (and any children she may decide to have) as one sub-unit, whereas her brother (and his existing and any future kids) as another sub-unit. Therefore from that perspective, the more kids you have, the greater the share you would have in the overall pool if you have more people in the sub-unit.\n\nOn the other hand, where you're coming from is to view the family in generational \"layers\", ie your children as one layer to preserve the memories, the grandchildren as one layer to preserve the wealth. I admire your family's foresight to protect the next generation's ability to make a comeback even if an adverse circumstance were to occur to the generation above. \n\nBecause this is a trust and not a will, I would suggest that you sit everyone down and explain the perspectives and mechanics of how the trust is supposed to work and address their concerns on a fundamental level. You might also want to separately try to speak to your daughter again to explain where you're coming from. This would hopefully avoid disputes in future as to the operation of the trust to frustrate your good intentions.", "NTA. Your money, your will.", "NTA. It's kind of an old fashioned way of doing things, but you aren't the first.  She doesn't seem to understand that \"neices and nephews getting more\" isn't the same as \"I'm getting less\". She doesn't seem to be worried about how unfair it would be for her to receive much more money than her brothers.\n\nIt's your money, you can do whatever you want with it. She chose not to have children so she shouldn't care about generational wealth.", "NTA and there is no logic in her request. There are two inheritances you get, one trustfund as a grandchild, and personal belongings/small amount of money as a child. Her wanting another trustfund is greedy, against the family tradition and unfair to her siblings. As others have pointed out, the trust fund would be her kids and she would not have access to the money. And for her to see money her hypothetical kids would get as her own, shows what kind of mother she would\u2018ve been.\n\nKeep holding on to your tradition!", "NTA. You could leave ALL your money to retired circus monkeys if you so decided. It is your money your \"rules\".", "I can see both sides of this. You are not the AH here tho. She doesn\u2019t get to decide what other people do with their money. \n\nYour daughter already inherited her amount. She can\u2019t also collect money for kids that she doesn\u2019t have for herself. \n\nI feel like you are doing the right thing and if she loves family more than money, she will understand this in the future.", "NTA and she's just being greedy and trying to use her feminism to manipulate you. Her logic is completely flawed for the reasons you explained. The only hypothetical people missing out on anything are her non-existent children. Her siblings are getting the same amount and she received her grandchild amount already so WTF does that have to do with the patriarchy? This coming from someone who sees the effects of our patriarchal society in almost anything. The only way she could play that card would be if your children received a personal inheritance based on how many children they had. Kinda curious how old she is because she sounds a bit immature still.", "NTA, inheritance really is one of those things where the person leaving the inheritance has the right to do basically whatever they want.\n\nIn your case, inheritance essentially skips a generation.  Your daughter already got a trust fund from her grandparents, just like her siblings did, so she wasn't excluded from anything. There are no grandchildren to inherit anything, so it makes perfect sense that no trusts are set up.\n\nIt's sort of strange that she would want anything, because if they were set up for her kids she wouldn't get any of that money either \u2013 her kids would. It's not like she would take that money from them, I hope. Your system is a little unorthodox but completely fair.\n\nMaybe you could set up some provision in case she changes her mind and does have kids? It's not really necessary but it might make her feel included, though it feels a bit overcomplicated and might lead to legal issues.", "\"It's a tradition\" is not a good reason in itself\n\nDo you actually think that this is the fairest thing to do, or the thing that will bring you the most happiness, or the thing that will result in your family all having a good relationship?", "NTA.\n\nYou should go back to her and thank her for deciding not to become a mother.", "NTA. Seems patriarchal to expect an inheritance", "Well if she is a smart girl she could always take control over your finances while you are alive.

I was only halfway serious. Yes, because it's the truth. No, because it won't help her or anyone else.", "So if it\u2019s a generation skipping trust though, while the trusts assets may only go to the grandkids for whom it was set up for, it\u2019s pretty common for any income generated by the trust assets to go to benefit the \u201cskipped\u201d generation - in this case that would mean op\u2019s kids that had grandkids are all benefitting from the income generated by the assets of the next generation\u2019s trusts tax free. But op\u2019s daughter doesn\u2019t actually get this same semi regular income benefit that the children that went and had kids do get. This might be a negligible amount that barely covers the cost of raising kids but given how organized and regular op\u2019s family is with this process it\u2019s probably a pretty penny.\n\nIf op\u2019s family trusts are set up in this manner then the daughter does kind of have a point.

I don\u2019t understand the idea of \u201cexpecting\u201d? \u201cDemanding\u201d? Inheritance. Go earn your own money", "NAH. This is a really interesting ethical and logical dilemma, and you both have valid points. You make your points clearly, but here\u2019s a way you could frame her position: Essentially, the trusts are set up to support the contributions to future generations that your children make. In the past, these contributions have always been human members of those future generations. Your daughter\u2019s contribution to future generations is to refrain from bringing more humans to an overpopulated planet. She, in essence, is making space and additional resources available for your other kids\u2019 children and all future children with this choice. What she\u2019s saying is, honor that space as you would honor a child because that space matters. \n\nMore importantly, it\u2019s not quite accurate to say that, even if she\u2019d had children, she wouldn\u2019t have gotten any of this trust. Most children take care of their parents eventually, and a trust fund definitely makes it more likely children will, as you say, get off to a good start in life. So your grandchildren will probably be able to take better care of your children in emergency and old age than kids without trust funds can. By not having children, your daughter is forgoing a very real safety net that people create for themselves by having children. When your daughter ages, when her spouse dies, as her friends die, she\u2019ll be entirely on her own. That\u2019s a very real material and emotional sacrifice she\u2019s making. You could see giving her a share of the trust as compensation for that sacrifice, as providing a very small version of the safety net that her children would have been. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s stepping out of tradition as much as you think to honor your daughter\u2019s unselfish choice by giving her one or two grandchildren\u2019s worth of your estate.", "Nta.

And she\u2019s being greedy.", "NTA; it's your money and you get to do with it as you choose. BUT, as a child-free woman, I sympathize with your daughter. The conditions under which your family established its traditions have changed. Back then, the world was not crashing in a fiery spiral of human-caused annihilation, and having more children actually helped a family's economic situation. You have it in your power to start a new tradition that reflects our contemporary realities: rewarding  children who do more than their fair share to look after the planet and the family by \\*not\\* having kids. \n\nAn extra bump of cash would also acknowledge that child-free people get dinged in all sorts of ways, including in our careers and finances. We pick up the slack at work when other folks go out on maternity/paternity leave. We do more than our fair share of elder care and kin care. When we get old, it's on us to make sure we've tucked away enough cash for our own care, because we don't have any kids to look after us. And day in, day out, we put up with all sorts of nonsense stereotypes about being barren spinsters, witches, misfits, etc. \n\nAnd so while you are not ethically compelled to cut your daughter a larger chunk of inheritance\u2014once again, it's your money, and you get to do with it as you wish\u2014there are good environmental and economic reasons to do so.", "Nta because your will is your desire.

However, I came down on YTA because I think the whole \"tradition\" is based on patriarchal values where everyone will have multiple children to leave the money to and things will end up fairly equal down the generations. But when some generations stop having kids or having far fewer, there is going to be a lot of money being saved \"for future generations\" that could be used to provide more of a safety net for the current and upcoming generations.", "I'm not advising it. It is just something that happens quite a lot", "That depends on when the money enters the trust. Really you didn't think that comment through", "They do. This is actually a pretty big issue in the USA", "You don't actually keep up with the news or the legal system. That's fine", "Exactly.  She's already planning to rob her kids of their college funds. \nNTA OP. Don't buckle to her ridiculousness", "This. I honestly don't get the whole idea of being entitled to money someone else made. I don't expect to get anything from my parents and hope they enjoy spending the money they worked for all their lives.", "It very much depends - so, for example, a friend of mine's family has something like this; one of his great aunts died young, so the trust was returned to the family 'pot' and was put into the next generation's distributions. \n\nIn his case, each person gets a trust, which is established when you're born, but controlled by a law firm. The trust cannot be spent on YOU, only on your children - and expenditures are from a list and approved by the firm. So, education fees, some extracurriculars, medical expenses the province doesn't cover... Those things are easy. Other things require consideration - when his aunt got divorced and her ex cleaned her out (excluding the trust) and vanished, the trust paid rent for her and her kids until she stabilized, but she couldn't buy a house with it.\n\nIn another case, his 'uncle' (technically a cousin, but super close family) developed MS young - never going to have kids,  and he needed a lot of assistance and eventually residential care. In that case, the trust was converted to pay his expenses, but everyone of his generation had to agree before the firm would create an 'exception' ... getting 15 people to agree on the use of multiple millions is not an everyday occurrence (this one was easy, but it's the only time in four generations a trust has been repurposed for the recipient's benefit).\n\nIt means that every kid in four generations has got a top-flight education without debt, and had the opportunity to pursue extracurriculars that they were really interested in. It doesn't pay for housing, or cars, or fancy clothes, or trips (with the exception of some school-related things), and I think there's a clause that says if you fail more than 1/4 of the credits required for a degree the trust stops paying until you've passed X courses and then will reimburse after the fact.\n\nBut it let my friend go to medical school without debt; his sister went to law school the same way, and that's a hell of a leg up.", "In American law there is a limit on provisions in a will that extend more than 21 years after the death of the originator. So presumably OP's will would have to specify what happens to the money if no grandchildren were born in that time frame.", "But it sounds like this trust system takes care of a lot of that.  A paid for education and money to start life.", "Woah woah woah no. That\u2019s not what a trust is. Assets and income generated in a trust are to be used for the benefit of the beneficiaries of the trust.", "Nope. This has been going for a while.", "Not for generation skipping trusts . They are different - I\u2019ve set them up for clients and am a U.S. attorney. They\u2019re a little different than a traditional/standard one", "Fair enough - my experience was in British discretionary trusts.", "Sure, generally. But the goal of this specific trust appears to be about setting up the grandkids in adulthood. At least that\u2019s how OP appears to describe it.", "Depends on the country. some country's require that children be given a certain amount in there parents wills", "Uh no op is describing a generation skipping trust - the kids don\u2019t have access to the assets in it and the grandkids are presumably at least 37.5 years younger than the testator / individuals setting up these trusts so it\u2019s a generation skipping trust. Sounds like there is an additional dynasty trust for the family with very specific rules and limited access to support any omitted / pretermitted grand kids", "Totally understandable- most trusts in the us are pretty much as you described anyway but gsts are irrevocable rather than discretionary  and just a weird specific nuance that are absorbed into other forms of estate planning in most other jurisdictions so tour comment makes complete sense  to me and I totally agree with you overall !", "Except that the world\u2019s population is not distributed evenly and having an aging population is bad for individual societies. Many first world countries are below replacement levels of reproduction as it is, and that is already having negative societal impacts.", "Which is literally how I\u2019ve heard every single gst described by people that have them. I mean I totally get it - don\u2019t get me wrong it\u2019s totally valid and fine to do (the problem is the underlying law is immoral imo but I also cannot fault someone for wanting to provide for their family down the road and ensure their familial created wealth helps yo support and keep their family\u2019s kids from having hard lives and struggles). I think that it needs to be changed majorly but an exception for education is totally fair and should exist.\n\nBut if it really was about education, the best way would be to enshrine that in the terms of the trust or create a specific trust for that purpose alone. The brother blew his on bad investments so it\u2019s clearly not the only case in which it can be used. It sounds like that was his is important to op that it be used for education support basically and so I see nothing wrong with her position at all. But that doesn\u2019t make the daughter\u2019s point about the overall system\u2019s shortcomings moot if that makes sense ?", "A fair comment. I am only familiar with my countries laws regarding this", "But it\u2019s not just for education. It\u2019s for giving the kids a headstart in adulthood. That could (and probably should) mean paying for education, but, presumably, it could also mean a downpayment for a house, or a fully paid-off car etc.\n\nI had a small trust. Since my college was paid for with scholarships, I use it to buy my first car, pay deposit on my first apartment etc.", "To a point I can understand why some countries do it the way they do, but I also see it as a way for people to abuse that system.", "Interesting I hadn\u2019t thought of the interest alone part and that makes total sense ! I also have dealt with land / business interest heavy ones too so that makes sense that I would deal more with ones where traditional interest goes back into the trust but income is treated separately- thanks for bringing this up! Estate planning can be so varied so it\u2019s good to remember that for me!\n\nAnd lol I feel like a lot of times it happens when I bring up a legal nuance that is different than common understanding people downvote me - cest la vie \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "But yours wasn\u2019t a gst and in a family that has some sort of dynasty trust it\u2019s just not the same thing. You\u2019re comparing your experience with your trust to one that\u2019s not actually the same. Op has indicated it\u2019s important to her that education be supported - a gst is not something you need to do for that reason. I fully agree with you generally speaking, re the point of a trust."]}
