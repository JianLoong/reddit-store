{"id": 18029, "submission_id": "13q6f2a", "title": "AITA for expecting a free coffee after I spilled my first one?", "selftext": "Yesterday I ordered a hot latte at this coffee shop I frequent. This place doesn't put a lid on your coffee when they give it to you--instead the lids/sleeves are on the counter and you do it yourself. They are also a dog friendly establishment and customers often bring their pets along with them.\n\nSo right as I was putting the lid on my coffee, this dog barked behind me. It's a small place and it was really loud and unexpected, and scared the shit out of me. My hand instinctively jerked up and I spilled hot coffee all over my arm and the counter. \n\nI apologized and helped the barista mop up the mess with the available napkins, and then asked if I could get another coffee since there was barely any left in my cup. She said that I'd need to wait in line so I could re-order and pay again. I replied that I'd already paid and hadn't had a chance to drink it at all, but she said it was their policy and it didn't matter.\n\nI didn't feel like arguing and was in a fair amount of pain from the spilled coffee, so I just said, \"Fine whatever,\" tossed my cup in the trash and left. Someone called me a Karen on my way out. Now that I've had some time to cool down (physically as well as emotionally lol), I'm wondering if it was entitled of me to expect a free replacement coffee. Also while I didn't make a scene, I wasn't particularly polite to the barista.\n\nEDIT: Thanks everyone for your input! To clear up a few questions/comments I keep seeing:\n1. They didn't offer any medical aid but I didn't ask for it--my arm wasn't seriously burned and I'm fine \n2. When I say I wasn't polite to the barista, this was after we'd had the brief exchange about getting a new drink on the house. I was very apologetic immediately after the spill. After she refused the refill, I just kind of rolled my eyes, said fine whatever, and left quickly. Under less stressful circumstances I'd be a lot more pleasant--I do think my response was kind of rude but I wasn't causing a scene.\n\nIt's split between YTA and NTA--I'll take the L in this case because after all I was the one who spilled the coffee, not the barista, and I shouldn't have pressed the issue. I'm not leaving a bad review but I'm probably not going back (mainly because of their dog policy--I like dogs but not too early in the morning!)", "created_utc": 1684889634, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13q6f2a/aita_for_expecting_a_free_coffee_after_i_spilled/", "score": 1025, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

While I have never spilled coffee, I have been in situations in which someone tips over the soda on a table and it is always filled with a smile.\n\nYou were not an arse for asking for a refill - it's not as if you had drunk most of it and were attempting to get something for nothing.", "NTA. if this place cared about customer service then you wouldn't have needed to ask.

Their insurance would absolutely end up paying out for a claim like this.  Customer injury on-site is a major liability. \n\nIf I handed one of my customers a pizza, and they got startled and dropped it on the way out or even right after they\u2019d gotten home, I\u2019d replace it for them.  And pizza has much higher overhead than coffee.  It\u2019s good business. And it\u2019s the right thing to do.

I wouldn\u2019t visit this place again, and I\u2019d try to get ahold of the owner to let them know what happened, and be sure to mention that you were burned by the coffee and that a rowdy dog startled you, causing the spill.

They should have given you a new cup, it costs them like 30 cents. And I wouldn't go back, leave a negative google review. Sounds like a dumb place anyways. Dogs, crazy.

The fact that they not only would make you pay again but also wait in line again is horrible customer service.

While it would have been nice to get a free refill I understand it. The barista didn't spill the coffee. You did even though it was an accidental spill. Also it wasn't just a black coffee it was a latte so it must be made. It has Expresso,steamed milk and frothed milk. Each has to be made separately. Those things cost the shop. You said it was a small shop so I'm also going to assume it's not a chain like d* kin or *bucks. Most importantly the barista is only following policy. She's doing her job. If you have a problem with that then contact the head person but don't be rude to a person only following the rules of her job. Being a barista or any type of hospitality job isn't easy. Especially in today's climate. No matter the job no one will risk their job for any reason. Bosses aren't always known to be reasonable. If she gave you the free coffee and someone was there who happened to have had a previous spill and didn't get one that could have caused problems for her if they complained. I think a simple apology is in order. The owner of the dog is the one who should have maybe replaced your latte. Even on that case it's hard to control when a dog barks or not.

This place doesn't put a lid on your coffee when they give it to you--instead the lids/sleeves are on the counter and you do it yourself. They are also a dog friendly establishment and customers often bring their pets along with them.\n\nSo right as I was putting the lid on my coffee, this dog barked behind me. It's a small place and it was really loud and unexpected, and scared the shit out of me. My hand instinctively jerked up and I spilled hot coffee all over my arm and the counter. \n\nI apologized and helped the barista mop up the mess with the available napkins, and then asked if I could get another coffee since there was barely any left in my cup. She said that I'd need to wait in line so I could re-order and pay again. I replied that I'd already paid and hadn't had a chance to drink it at all, but she said it was their policy and it didn't matter.\n\nI didn't feel like arguing and was in a fair amount of pain from the spilled coffee, so I just said, \"Fine whatever,\" tossed my cup in the trash and left. Someone called me a Karen on my way out. Now that I've had some time to cool down (physically as well as emotionally lol), I'm wondering if it was entitled of me to expect a free replacement coffee. Also while I didn't make a scene, I wasn't particularly polite to the barista.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I did it again last week, and it never even crossed my mind that they should pay replace it, I didn't even ask.

They remade my drink, no questions.", "I kind of get them asking OP to wait in line again. It sucks, but either OP has to wait or the other customers have to wait so everyone gets their stuff. That doesn't seem that unreasonable. They should have remade it though. \n\nSometimes people are just jerks though. Once in a McDonald's drive thru I ordered a mocha and the guy handed me large coffee cup and I didn't notice the lid was only half on. It fell off and black coffee, which wasn't even my order, went all over my hand and my lap when I took it into the car. He just started at me when I asked for more napkins even. It hurt like hell and he acted like I was inconveniencing him. I was so startled that I actually yelled something like \"holy shit ow, also this isn't even mine.\" I was trying to get napkins to get this burning coffee off of my skin and he was trying to herd me away from his window. Smh.", "Maybe this has changed, but when I was a barista and we were busy we weren't steaming individual amounts of milk per order. If you have three skim drinks in line you're steaming enough to make all three skim drinks at once. So while it wouldn't have been as easy as pouring a drip coffee, one latte wouldn't have significantly impacted the line.\n\n(And you know how many drinks you have because your coworkers are calling down the line so you can work on them as the person on the cash register is doing their part. A coffee shop that, in a rush, waits to make a drink until it's paid for is a slow-ass coffee shop.)", "I used to work at a Tim Hortons and a young lady bumped her shoulder on the pickup counter when leaving with her coffee. It spilled everywhere and the cup was basically empty. I ran around with a mop and asked if she was alright cuz it was really fresh and hot. She was ok and asked to pay for another coffee. I told her to wait there and I\u2019d get her a new one no charge. It took all of 5 minutes and she gave me like a $10 tip cuz of it. Every time she came back she always gave a tip of some form, she said it was cuz we were so nice to her", "Might be saying something about the type of customer OP is if they're a regular and the barista makes this call.", "Mmm, ass pizza.", "I worked in restaurants for almost fifteen years (thirteen years at places that served pizza) and never had anyone knock their entire pizza off the table. I\u2019m not doubting you, I\u2019m just curious why that was a thing that repeatedly happened \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "We would still make you wait to the end of the line, if the spill wasn\u2019t our fault. A bummer of a klutz move doesn\u2019t justify inconveniencing the whole queue.", "But I've never worked in a coffee shop that wouldn't have you make another one in a heartbeat for an honest accident. It's sixty seconds MAX when the machine is hot.", "Actually lattes are easy and pretty quick to make. They definitely should have replaced OP's drink.", "3-4min is not time consuming.  That cafe just has a shitty policy regarding customer service.", "20 years ago I was a barista, and it really isn't time consuming at all. I could make one in under a minute.", "Exactly! McDonald\u2019s and Tim Hortons have lattes! If Starbucks can have my latte out the window by the time I drive around, then it\u2019s not that big a deal. \n\nPeople here saying it takes 3-4 minutes to make a latte! Like, is it made from the milk of a prized and rare mountain cow, which needs to be simmered exactly at the temperature where liquid turns to steam or it\u2019ll curdle, then topped with gold flakes that need to be scraped with the teeth of a Venus fly trap?\n\nIt\u2019s a latte\u2026 and if I were the barista, I\u2019d have seen that it wasn\u2019t her fault and remade the drink. Worked a lot of barista jobs and the rule was if it didn\u2019t go out the door or was above 75% full, we\u2019d remake it.", "Wait was it McDonald\u2019s, I\u2019m confused why you used italics. It\u2019s almost like you are trying to make some sort of secondary point", "Its kinda gross that dogs are allowed in restaurants and cafes to begin with.", "I have 3 dogs. One would be absolutely miserable going most places with me. He loves people but doesn\u2019t like new places. They make him nervous. My second dog is too excitable. He doesn\u2019t bark but thinks everyone is his new best friend. I know that he can be overwhelming, and I can\u2019t imagine subjecting unsuspecting people to that. My 3rd dog does go almost everywhere with me, but she\u2019s a task trained service dog. She\u2019s quiet, doesn\u2019t want to be bothered when she\u2019s on duty, and people only know she\u2019s with me if they see her. People tell me it\u2019s not fair to only bring one with me but I think it\u2019s unfair to people to have to deal with a dog that doesn\u2019t have public manners.", "Seriously!? Dogs are amazing and simple creatures. Mine is happy barking at squirrels and sleeping on the beanbag chair she stole. It's 6 feet across. She rolls her eyes like the proper cranky old lady she is, and I can't imagine wanting to take her into a Restaurant or anywhere around strangers. She's friendly enough, but hoomans man.", "That depends on the dogs personality and temperament", "They did the same thing for me as well. They made my drink and sandwich and told me to call the store I accidentally placed my order at.", "As a former batista there at one point, you are right. It would have been replaced without the customer even asking.", "My eyebrows would have visibly risen, and I would have done/said something similar. Then I\u2019d never go back.", "She got burned by hot coffee in addition to being startled by an untrained dog. Plus, she hadn't had her coffee yet, which can contribute to irritability.  I give her a pass on this one.", ">denied a new cup and sent  to the back of the to repay also sounds embarrassing\n\nIf it were me I feel like I'm being scammed", "i\u2019m saying this because I work at a grocery store.. it\u2019s policy. it\u2019s not the employees going above and beyond, it\u2019s literally in our training. as much as i\u2019d like to not give a replacement to the person thats rude when THEY were the one that broke something, I have to give it to them- cuz policy.", "I also don't see how bring startled by a barking dog is the Barista's fault.", "She got and she spilled it.  If the *Barista* spilled it, then that'd be different.", "She was putting her lid onto the top of her coffee.  At which point would it be considered she got her coffee?", "Heck better not put them near roads either an ambulance siren could go off.", "Well, yes, had they put lids and sleeves on the cups like almost every other coffee shop, it wouldn\u2019t have spilled. That\u2019s kind of the reason coffee shops do that for you. I used to work at Starbucks and their old policy was that even if a customer asked we could not give them a coffee without a lid because of liability. And a dog inside of a business should not be barking. \n\nOP still spilled it so yes technically their fault, but external circumstances created by the coffee shop is what caused them to have that reaction.", "all of which seems relevant to the story.", "You don't understand what the word sarcasm means.", "OP can't take a joke like how did they not tell", "That\u2019s what the spill-happy cabal want you to think. Ha!", "Actually the beverage probably costs 50 cents to re-brew?", "OP wasn\u2019t abusive and it\u2019s really not ridiculous to ask for a replacement cup, when it costs the company less than $1 to make, and they don\u2019t even put a lid on for you. Which obviously increases spills.", "Was OP really being abusive?", "I'm salty from years in hospitality as well but she apologized and helped clean up.\n\nYou could literally be on fire and some people would still flag you down for another round of cocktails", "It's the curse of inside knowledge - you can never win. \nWe're forever cursed to stack all our dishes at the end, insist on packing up our own food and leave our glasses on the bar on the way out with a 50% tip\n :)", "I was kind of thinking the same thing. 15 year old me wouldn't have given a free coffee in this situation, for a multitude of reasons. Close to 40 year old me absolutely would have.", "That's what training is for. A manager simply saying, \"Use your best judgment. If the customer deserves to have their drink remade, then remake it, no matter the policy.\" \n\nI used to be the trainer at a restaurant I worked at for 6 years. Young, new servers are often nervous and unsure. Especially about when it's required to follow policy and when it's okay to bend the rules. That's why I purposely included things like that in training. We don't want to piss off a customer because anxiety-filled Makaylah **assumes** she has no flexibility in handling situations herself.", "Yes! Dogs where food is served is super weird to me.", "Well that\u2019s my choice as a customer.\nIt was an accident, it happened immediately, and that\u2019s pretty shitty customer service.\n\nWhere I live there are great coffee shops everywhere.\nWhy would I go back?", ">You wouldn't return to a shop because they didn't replace your coffee?  \n\nIt's not the matter of money. It's matter of principle. And also how nice they treat their customer.", "For me, it's the \"it's policy\" line that would make me never return. It's not about the money. It's about the obvious lack of general common sense and the refusal to be flexible in case of accidents. \n\nIf their policy is completely inflexible or cannot be ignored when a customer has lost their drink **through no fault of their own within seconds of it being handed over** then that establishment considers their customer's experience to be unimportant. \n\nIf they think my experience in their business is unimportant, then I won't be rewarding that attitude with more of my patronage.", "I totally did that at a fast food place once. Paid and then just drove away! A few minutes later, I realized and went back, laughing my head off. They were really confused, but they still had my food, so they just gave it to me.

What we had was a family owned coffee shack. It was a dive!!! We made the best coffees ever. It wasn't rocket surgery, and it took one minute to make a latte.

At the bare minimum I expect to be able to leave the store with the product I bought.
