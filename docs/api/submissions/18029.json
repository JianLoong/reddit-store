{"id": 18029, "submission_id": "13q6f2a", "title": "AITA for expecting a free coffee after I spilled my first one?", "selftext": "Yesterday I ordered a hot latte at this coffee shop I frequent. This place doesn't put a lid on your coffee when they give it to you--instead the lids/sleeves are on the counter and you do it yourself. They are also a dog friendly establishment and customers often bring their pets along with them.\n\nSo right as I was putting the lid on my coffee, this dog barked behind me. It's a small place and it was really loud and unexpected, and scared the shit out of me. My hand instinctively jerked up and I spilled hot coffee all over my arm and the counter. \n\nI apologized and helped the barista mop up the mess with the available napkins, and then asked if I could get another coffee since there was barely any left in my cup. She said that I'd need to wait in line so I could re-order and pay again. I replied that I'd already paid and hadn't had a chance to drink it at all, but she said it was their policy and it didn't matter.\n\nI didn't feel like arguing and was in a fair amount of pain from the spilled coffee, so I just said, \"Fine whatever,\" tossed my cup in the trash and left. Someone called me a Karen on my way out. Now that I've had some time to cool down (physically as well as emotionally lol), I'm wondering if it was entitled of me to expect a free replacement coffee. Also while I didn't make a scene, I wasn't particularly polite to the barista.\n\nEDIT: Thanks everyone for your input! To clear up a few questions/comments I keep seeing:\n1. They didn't offer any medical aid but I didn't ask for it--my arm wasn't seriously burned and I'm fine \n2. When I say I wasn't polite to the barista, this was after we'd had the brief exchange about getting a new drink on the house. I was very apologetic immediately after the spill. After she refused the refill, I just kind of rolled my eyes, said fine whatever, and left quickly. Under less stressful circumstances I'd be a lot more pleasant--I do think my response was kind of rude but I wasn't causing a scene.\n\nIt's split between YTA and NTA--I'll take the L in this case because after all I was the one who spilled the coffee, not the barista, and I shouldn't have pressed the issue. I'm not leaving a bad review but I'm probably not going back (mainly because of their dog policy--I like dogs but not too early in the morning!)", "created_utc": 1684889634, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13q6f2a/aita_for_expecting_a_free_coffee_after_i_spilled/", "score": 2157, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

While I have never spilled coffee, I have been in situations in which someone tips over the soda on a table and it is always filled with a smile.\n\nYou were not an arse for asking for a refill - it's not as if you had drunk most of it and were attempting to get something for nothing.", "NTA. if this place cared about customer service then you wouldn't have needed to ask.

Their insurance would absolutely end up paying out for a claim like this.  Customer injury on-site is a major liability. \n\nIf I handed one of my customers a pizza, and they got startled and dropped it on the way out or even right after they\u2019d gotten home, I\u2019d replace it for them.  And pizza has much higher overhead than coffee.  It\u2019s good business. And it\u2019s the right thing to do.

I wouldn\u2019t visit this place again, and I\u2019d try to get ahold of the owner to let them know what happened, and be sure to mention that you were burned by the coffee and that a rowdy dog startled you, causing the spill.  They should be putting lids in those coffees anyway, unless they\u2019re being served to consume on site.", "NTA in the future I would not go back there and I would also leave an honest negative review if they have a webpage, and one thing that really annoys me is people having to bring their dogs everywhere not everybody thinks they are cute, I can't even go to the grocery store anymore without encountering someone walking their dog or having it in a basket in the store, places need to let in service dogs only the rest of them need to stay outside or at home.", "Honestly NTA for asking. They should have given you a new cup, it costs them like 30 cents. And I wouldn't go back, leave a negative google review. Sounds like a dumb place anyways. Dogs, crazy.

The fact that they not only would make you pay again but also wait in line again is horrible customer service.

While it would have been nice to get a free refill I understand it. The barista didn't spill the coffee. You did even though it was an accidental spill. Also it wasn't just a black coffee it was a latte so it must be made. It has Expresso,steamed milk and frothed milk. Each has to be made separately. Those things cost the shop. You said it was a small shop so I'm also going to assume it's not a chain like d* kin or *bucks. Most importantly the barista is only following policy. She's doing her job. If you have a problem with that then contact the head person but don't be rude to a person only following the rules of her job. Being a barista or any type of hospitality job isn't easy. Especially in today's climate. No matter the job no one will risk their job for any reason. Bosses aren't always known to be reasonable. If she gave you the free coffee and someone was there who happened to have had a previous spill and didn't get one that could have caused problems for her if they complained. I think a simple apology is in order. The owner of the dog is the one who should have maybe replaced your latte. Even on that case it's hard to control when a dog barks or not.

This place doesn't put a lid on your coffee when they give it to you--instead the lids/sleeves are on the counter and you do it yourself. They are also a dog friendly establishment and customers often bring their pets along with them.\n\nSo right as I was putting the lid on my coffee, this dog barked behind me. It's a small place and it was really loud and unexpected, and scared the shit out of me. My hand instinctively jerked up and I spilled hot coffee all over my arm and the counter. \n\nI apologized and helped the barista mop up the mess with the available napkins, and then asked if I could get another coffee since there was barely any left in my cup. She said that I'd need to wait in line so I could re-order and pay again. I replied that I'd already paid and hadn't had a chance to drink it at all, but she said it was their policy and it didn't matter.\n\nI didn't feel like arguing and was in a fair amount of pain from the spilled coffee, so I just said, \"Fine whatever,\" tossed my cup in the trash and left. Someone called me a Karen on my way out. Now that I've had some time to cool down (physically as well as emotionally lol), I'm wondering if it was entitled of me to expect a free replacement coffee. Also while I didn't make a scene, I wasn't particularly polite to the barista.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I did it again last week, and it never even crossed my mind that they should pay replace it, I didn't even ask.

Like the og comment said, it costs very little to replace something and businesses want repeat customers. Businesses aren\u2019t *expected* to do that but a lot of them are very happy to, and OP should probably go to those places instead", "I went to Panera once and they forgot to give me my coffee, so my mom went back, it\u2019s pretty close to my house, and the barista offered to make me a second one for free since whoever gave us the order forgot to give us the coffee, and I was it the car at the time while my mom grabbed the to go order. Some ppl are just super sweet, and it definitely makes you want to go back to an establishment when you know nice kind ppl work there.", "I paid once and drove off, forgetting to take my coffee... came back expecting to pay and start  over, and the good people working there made me a whole new latte.", "Yes.   I was standing in the middle of the cafe once and just feel over. (Been a super klutz my entire life) Nothing tripped me, scared me, there was no reason. They remade my drink, no questions.", "I kind of get them asking OP to wait in line again. It sucks, but either OP has to wait or the other customers have to wait so everyone gets their stuff. That doesn't seem that unreasonable. They should have remade it though. \n\nSometimes people are just jerks though. Once in a McDonald's drive thru I ordered a mocha and the guy handed me large coffee cup and I didn't notice the lid was only half on. It fell off and black coffee, which wasn't even my order, went all over my hand and my lap when I took it into the car. He just started at me when I asked for more napkins even. It hurt like hell and he acted like I was inconveniencing him. I was so startled that I actually yelled something like \"holy shit ow, also this isn't even mine.\" I was trying to get napkins to get this burning coffee off of my skin and he was trying to herd me away from his window. Smh.", "Maybe this has changed, but when I was a barista and we were busy we weren't steaming individual amounts of milk per order. If you have three skim drinks in line you're steaming enough to make all three skim drinks at once. So while it wouldn't have been as easy as pouring a drip coffee, one latte wouldn't have significantly impacted the line.\n\n(And you know how many drinks you have because your coworkers are calling down the line so you can work on them as the person on the cash register is doing their part. A coffee shop that, in a rush, waits to make a drink until it's paid for is a slow-ass coffee shop.)", "I used to work at a Tim Hortons and a young lady bumped her shoulder on the pickup counter when leaving with her coffee. It spilled everywhere and the cup was basically empty. I ran around with a mop and asked if she was alright cuz it was really fresh and hot. She was ok and asked to pay for another coffee. I told her to wait there and I\u2019d get her a new one no charge. It took all of 5 minutes and she gave me like a $10 tip cuz of it.

She was vilified by the whole country. But in reality she was so severely burned she was in the hospital for a while and had to have skin grafts. She was older and wearing clothes she couldn\u2019t get out of easily which attributed to the burns, but still! I burned my mouth on their coffee once and it was once of the worst burns I\u2019ve ever had.

The coffee shop isn't loud, a lot of people are doing remote work. They have ample indoor and outdoor seating, I only sit inside with her if we can have our own space.

Or, if not their fault then their responsibility to respond to anything that happens because of their dog. Dogs bark, yes, but if you know you have a very loud dog maybe the dog shouldn\u2019t be in a coffee shop (altho im picturing an enclosed, tight space, so maybe this is different?) I only say this because I have a toddler. Toddlers are allowed most places but I purposefully don\u2019t take him where he has a high chance of being destructive (tight spaces, nicer glass-filled restaurants, etc), and if he ever did cause someone to spill a drink by yelling excitedly like kids do, I\u2019d immediately offer the person a new drink.", "Yeah, I had a customer juggling a pizza box and keys and lose an XL pizza in our parking lot.

It's the norm.\n\nWhy? Because it fosters good customer relations and customer loyalty more effectively than any marketing you could pay for at a much higher price. It's stupid and short sighted from a business perspective not to replace it.", "Regardless of how you\u2019d personally feel, watching a customer accidentally spill hot coffee on themselves then telling them they need to pay again for a product that costs you nearly nothing is just an incredibly dumb way to run a restaurant.

Especially for a loyal customer, it's not worth it to hold them to the letter of the law. Now they've lost OP as a customer, too. Not sure how worried the staff were about their injury, either.\n\nI'm kind of salty about this because years ago, I burned my mouth on a fondue in a cafe, and they wouldn't let me take a bottle of water to try to calm the pain.

Free merch, free visit, free coffee. At the end of the day, losing $6 over a coffee and having the customer inclined to return, tell their friends, etc. is worth far more than earning $6 and losing a customer, their word of mouth, etc. And the establishment I worked at was experience-based and way less likely to get repeat customers as, say, a coffee shop. Still, making the experience excellent and accommodating for the customer always trumped losing some money.", "It's not the barista's fault, no.

Many places would know you by name if you are a regular. \n\nSo replacing a spilled coffee should really not be a big deal. Technically it\u2019s OPs fault. But poor customer service.", "OP wasn't just clumsy, they were startled by a barking dog.", "But if you think of it in a good customer service sense and not in a property sense it makes total sense to refill the coffee. Drip coffee costs a few cents to these businesses and the opportunity costs is seconds to refill. So they lose almost nothing but providing a good customer service experience creates loyal customers, and a base of loyal customers is invaluable - definitely worth a few cents. Refilling this customers cup (especially without them asking) not only shows good customer service to the patron but also any other patrons that are watching. \nIs OP owed more coffee? No but it will cost the business almost nothing to provide and the value they get in return is worth it.", "Completely agree. I have been in this exact situation where I spilt my coffee all over myself. The waiter not only helped me clean it up, he brought me a new coffee without asking and did not charge me. I felt like that was above and beyond customer service (I left them a great review and a good tip).

And I will go there again!", "And you still remember it and have probably told other people so this one act of kindness has created a ton more business for that shop. So the cost of the coffee was a solid investment.", "I was at a kinda fast food / restaurant place once and for some reason someone in my family decided that I should be the one to go get the food tray. Probs because I was the youngest sibling. The issue is I\u2019m also the clumsiest person I know. I fell down the stairs at least twice a week at school. I should note this was one of those places that put your food in baskets with the pretty paper so nothing was closed up at all. Drinks were on the tray too in glasses. Anyway the inevitable happened and I tripped over nothing and spilled my entire family\u2019s food. The workers rushed to help me up and clean the spilled food and glass and then comforted me while getting new food for my family for free. I\u2019m still not allowed to carry food trays probably a decade later! \n\n\nUnfortunately that place has closed since but after the way we were treated there it became a near weekly tradition to go there for lunch after church!

I cheerfully griped that the day before I'd dropped my drink getting out of the car at work -- didn't even get a sip of it.  Got my drink for free.

It can be a pain when we're busy, but profit margins on something like a latte are so high that it's much more important to just keep customers happy.", "I think part of the disconnect is the fact that a lot of people in service positions aren\u2019t the ones to make that call, nor should they be. I had a similar incident happen while I was working at an ice cream shop in high school, where a customer immediately dropped an ice cream and angrily asked for a free replacement, and I was scared that doing so would put my job at risk. Of course now I realize that replacing an ice cream isn\u2019t a big deal, but I remember at the time being surprised at the lack of empathy from the customer towards my position and that getting a free product was more important to them than my source of income. \n\nNow if something like this was company policy, that\u2019s a different scenario.", "I also think this situation would be different if they put the lids on the drink before giving it to the customer.

I worked as a barista for a few years and i definitely would\u2019ve given her a refill. It\u2019s  usually made in a large batches and I hated having to throw away the leftover coffee anyway.

That was all I asked.\n\nThe people at that restaurant went completely above and beyond for my daughter.  They made her single servings of each dish that were nutfree, just so she could try everything.  Despite being a buffet, my daughter got table service.\n\nYou'd better believe I told EVERYONE about how amazing that place was.  Seven years later, and I'm still raving about it.", "They even got the money in this case.

This was more the dog owner's fault than the restaurant, they're not courteous and may have lost a customer but that isn't the crux of OP's post, the focus is about the reason that caused this scenario.
