She has a very entitled attitude about many things she does, and me and my little brother (19M) call her out a lot on it, and sometimes we get extremely embarrassed about the way she speaks or acts. Some examples include, but aren\u2019t limited to: cutting in line, calling out very loudly to waiters, being very annoyed when the service isn\u2019t quick enough (even when the place is packed), and some others that don\u2019t come to mind atm. To her credit, when we call her out, she usually protests a little bit but then calms down, and otherwise she\u2019s a good mom. \n\n\nHowever, she has this\u2026 habit. She can never say please AND thank you. Sometimes she doesn\u2019t say either! And she does it so condescendingly. Per example, instead of saying \u201cCan I have some bread please ? [gives bread] thank you!\u201d She will say \u201ccan I have some bread ? Thanks.\u201d BEFORE the person hands her the bread. Or she\u2019ll just outright say \u201ccan I have some bread\u201d, and when given bread will not say anything. My little brother and I cannot stand when she does that, ESPECIALLY to waiters. We\u2019re kinda used to it, even though when she does that I tell her \u201cyou\u2019re making my ears bleed\u201d lol. \n\n\nAnyways, we\u2019re on vacation atm, and since we eat all the time together I\u2019ve seen her do this for about half a week now, so I thought I\u2019d give her a taste of her own medicine. I\u2019ve stopped saying both. I\u2019ll just go to her and ask her something without saying please or thanks (with a demanding tone), and to her credit, she hadn\u2019t noticed it at first. \n\n\nThis morning I told her \u201cpass me the salt\u201d and she looked at me and said \u201cwhy have you been so rude lately?\u201d And I innocently said \u201cwhat do you mean, mom?\u201d, holding back a grin. She said \u201cyou haven\u2019t been saying please or thank you, it\u2019s very demeaning.\u201d AHA. I looked at her and said, \u201cbut\u2026. Don\u2019t you do that all the time?\u201d. She looked at me with a frown and I started grinning. My brother started laughing and she didn\u2019t say a word. My stepdad came to me later saying that I was a butthole for doing this to my mom just to teach her a lesson. He said that me being rude made her think something was wrong, and not that I was just being petty. That we\u2019re on vacation, not here to fight, and that she doesn\u2019t want to have to be careful about everything she says in front of her 22 year old daughter when she\u2019s 50, and it\u2019s hard to change bad habits.\n\n\nNow I feel bad because she\u2019s been kinda pouting and I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d take it that bad.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1671700147, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zshjx9/aita_for_not_saying_please_or_thank_you_to_my_mom/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It seems like your mom isn't a bad person but has bad manners and bad habits. Showing her how it feels to be spoken to rudely without knowing why is a good lesson. It sucks that a 22 year old has to teach a 50 year old lessons in manners, but it seems like it's working.
