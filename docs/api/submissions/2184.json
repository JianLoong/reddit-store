I know the title makes me seem awful already, but here\u2019s the situation before you make up your mind:\n\nI recently transferred schools my junior year, and I joined theater. I have a lead role in our fall play. I have been at rehearsals for it M-F after school for weeks, since September. Our opening night is this Wednesday 11/16.  I want my family to come see me obviously!\n\nMy dad asked me if my younger sister could \u201cbring her iPad to the show since she would be bored.\u201d That\u2019s when I started to get sad. I told him that is a little insulting to me, but he kept saying \u201cshe won\u2019t enjoy the show.\u201d\n\nI started to feel mad and I started to yell and I told him that this is really insulting to my hard work, and that all I wanted her to do was watch. I also called her a spoiled brat. I don\u2019t care if she loves it or hates it, I just want her there for me. Not playing a silly little iPad game\u2026\n\nMy dad told me that I\u2019m \u201cjealous\u201d of her and that I can\u201dt \u201calways get my way.\u201d Now he is insanely mad at me. Maybe I\u2019m wrong, but to me I just want her to come and see me on my opening night on something I\u2019ve worked so hard for.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT:\nI missed a few important facts.\n1. She has sat through plays and dance recitals of mine before without an iPad before. She was fine, she behaves. I don\u2019t know what changed.\n\n2. The show is 35 minutes at first, then intermission, then another 35 minutes. In terms of shows, it\u2019s one of the shortest ones I know of and probably the shortest I\u2019ve done.\n\n3. She has been incredibly clingy to her iPad lately and won\u2019t even put it down at dinner, for bed, etc. It\u2019s hysteria and tears everytime she has to put it down. My dad doesn\u2019t get mad at her either about it.", "created_utc": 1668289346, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ytj7wp/aita_for_telling_my_dad_my_little_sister_is_a/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's a bright ass screen in a dark room. It won't kill an 8 year old to sit still for a short while to watch a show. She doesn't need her iPad at all times.", "NTA. When I was in kindergarten I silently sat and enjoyed my older siblings\u2019 theatre productions. 8YO can and should do the same.", "NTA. Your fathers comment was out of line. He shouldn\u2019t have said you are jealous.  She is 8. She can sit and deal with being bored.  Too many kids don\u2019t learn how to deal with being bored.  And you are right. She might not be bored at all she might like it and be fascinated at the game of \u201cpretend\u201d. \n\nYour dad is being a lazy parent really by not teaching an 8 year old how to sit still and shut up for a short time. \n\nYou are not jealous you just want an 8 year old to be able to behave properly for her age.", "NTA. Your younger sister has to realize she can\u2019t always have her iPad with her at all times and it sounds like she needs restricted screen time such as only using the iPad for maybe 30 minutes a day.", "Based on the info given, I think your Dad is in the wrong here and you slightly for calling your sister a brat.  Unless your sister is demanding to bring the iPad, it sounds like the fault is entirely on your Dad for being unsupportive and lazy.  You shouldn\u2019t take your frustrations out on your sister, but take issue with your Dad.  If he can\u2019t watch your play and take care of a bored/disruptive child for a couple hours, then he is being a bad parent.  Who knows, your sister could end up liking the play and be totally fine, but regardless it\u2019s on him to be a good parent.  I\u2019ve gone to many plays with younger siblings and an infant nephew and it\u2019s manageable to do so without being disrespectful by bringing an IPAD.  \n\nAlso, you should start by saying how using a phone or iPad during a performance is extremely rude and disrespectful regardless of age.", "NTA, and I hope your dad sees this so he knows that he needs to step up and be a parent, starting with taking her iPad away.", "NTA.\n\nWon\u2019t your parents and your sister get kicked out of the theater for doing that?!", "I mean she\u2019s 8 when I was 8 I brought coloring sheets to my brothers stuff maybe that would be a better solution and less distracting to others. Some kids can\u2019t sit still. what\u2019s the show because some things an 8yr old just wouldn\u2019t enjoy are really understand. \n\nAlso the fact that you\u2019re dad says you\u2019re jealous of her makes me think there is more going on because that\u2019s a weird thing for him to say and a red flag", "Doesn\u2019t sound like your sister is the main problem. I think it\u2019s your dad. I\u2019d be super unhappy if my father acted like the play would be boring having never seen it NTA", "tell your dad you dont want or need him there anymore as he seems more concerned for your sister than he does for you good luck", "ESH.\n\nShe\u2019s 8. We don\u2019t know what your play is about, but there\u2019s a good chance that she will not get the subject, nor understand everything and that it would be too long for a child to follow through. You\u2019re old enough to understand that and not take it personally if she actually gets bored on your big day. It has nothing to do with you working hard or the play not being interesting enough, she\u2019s just not part of the targeted public. Yelling that she was a spoiled brat when it\u2019s your dad who\u2019s insisting about the iPad was uncalled for. Don\u2019t feel offended at the thought that she might be bored. She might be. That\u2019s no big deal.\n\nBut also, usually, no phones, no iPad, not anything disturbing in the public is expected for a play. And your father overly insisting is not okay. If your sister is bored, she can absolutely be bored silently on her chair and tell you how long it was for her afterwards. There is no need to make specific changes for her.\n\nIt escalated because both of you felt attacked and attacked back. You took personally the fact that he expects your sister to be bored at the play, and he felt attacked in his parenting when you said your sister was a spoiled brat. Is it just this time or has he shown signs of favouritism on several occasions ? It sounds like the background lead to the situation more than the situation itself.", "NTA my three year old cousin can sit well behaved through a two hour play\u2026. Pretty sure an eight year old can too", "YTA\n\nYour dad is right.  She is going to get bored.  It\u2019s not realistic or developmentally appropriate to expect an 8 year old to sit through a high school play, and not fidget /squirm / become bored.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course her ipad is more interesting to her than your show. What would you expect. She is 8. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" I also called her a spoiled brat. I don\u2019t care if she loves it or hates it, I just want her there for me.\" ..

Don't do it yourself. They'll make you buy her a new one.", "I sat through three hours of my sister\u2019s high school graduation with no problems when I was four. Ab eight year old can absolutely watch a play with no problems. NTA.", "Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have called her that, I agree. She just gets away with a lot. And yeah, it\u2019s just not proper theater etiquette. What makes it odd is that she\u2019s sat through plays and dance recitals of mine without any issue before? Now she needs an iPad?", "Yeah!", "He doesn\u2019t even parent her in the first place. He\u2019s an enabler for bratty behavior. Yes, a lot led up to this. He doesn\u2019t discipline her, but when I was 8? Good god I got yelled at for breathing the wrong way. It frustrates me with the way he just isn\u2019t teaching her better.", "Wait what? My autistic 7yr old sat through hus cousins play, my developmentally delayed 4yr old sat through his uncles graduation. You honestly are trying to peddle a 8yr old who absolutely has the ability to comprehend empathy and the basics of manners can't sit through a play... they can.  She could her dad just doesn't want to have to parent her.\n\n8yr olds aren't toddlers.  And most schools start trips to the local theater in grade 1.  So yes at 8 she can sit through a play.", "She has sat through a few before + dance recitals of mine without an iPad. What changed?", "A high school play is probably shorter than most Marvel movies, and 8 years olds manage those just fine. If anything it's easier than a movie because there's an intermission.", "You don\u2019t understand how insulting that is, but okay. Whatever you say!", "Sounds like she's got a good start on having a tech addiction. This can turn into a really big problem. Your dad needs to put his foot down.", "I\u2019m wondering whether or not your father wants that to happen.", "Did you watch her and see how she behaved during those?", "Do you honestly think a high school play is as interesting or as stimulating as a marvel movie?", "Yes. She was fine. No tears, no antics.", "You literally just said earlier that she would probably not understand the content of the play. You expect her to understand the content of a marvel movie? I'm 17 and *I* barely understand marvel lol.", "Really?  Your measure of whether or not she behaved is *tears*?\n\nYou were on stage.  I highly doubt you were watching her and noticing her squirming as much as your dad, who was sitting beside her.\n\n\u201cSit here and be bored because your sister says so\u201d is not fair to her.  Yes, individual children may be capable of sitting for that long without disturbing other audience members, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right to force them to.", "I never said she wouldn\u2019t understand it.  I said she would be bored, and that it\u2019s not developmentally appropriate to ask her to sit through a high school play that is boring to her.", "I\u2019ve asked before and my dad has told me. He has told me she was good and sat and watched. His words, not mine.  Besides, it\u2019s also not proper theater etiquette to be on a device anyways."]}
