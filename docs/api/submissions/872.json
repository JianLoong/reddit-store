BG: Ellie and her brother Leo and late brother Josh were raised by my MIL. MIL was a former foster child who never found a forever family in the system and was never able to track down any biological family though she does believe she'd have half siblings somewhere. When Ellie and her brothers dad then decided to quit his job and leave her on her own to raise the kids she struggled. Then she lost Josh, the oldest, when he was 16 years old. It tore them apart and was yet another big hit for my MIL who did everything she could for her kids.\n\nEllie has talked about how her mom suffered terribly with her mental health under the strain of everything and how she's grateful that she was able to recover enough to be present in their lives today.\n\nToday MIL is starting to financially be in a better, more stable place, but she's far from rich. She's also not dropping everything to help her kids all the time. Ellie and Leo have told me before that their mom had to give away so much of herself when they were growing up, had to spread herself so thin, that they don't think she could do it anymore, because she had no support and only had her kids, who she didn't want to burden. So even though we live close to MIL and Leo, she's not offering to be our childcare (not that we expect her to but I will get to why I say that) and she didn't pay for our wedding or throw us a big massive baby shower. She's a wonderful person and Ellie will always say she is the best mom and would never ever want to lose her.\n\nMy parents were visiting this weekend and we had the argument. Back when we were engaged they had commented that our wedding was not as big as they would have expected and that my MIL had not paid for anything. I told them it was our wedding, not MILs, so she had no reason to pay for it. I told them not to bring it up again. They knew they history then. But it was bothering them that we chose to live close to her when she \"gives nothing and does nothing a mother and expectant grandmother should do\". They then started talking about how it must kill my wife that her own mother doesn't care, is a crappy mother and how they know she likely hoped MIL would offer to watch our child while we both work, and throw her a big baby shower and offer to be on hand to help with every little thing. I told them they had no right to speak about what my wife wanted, and how dare they judge MIL so harshly when they know what she has been through. I told them I did not want them upsetting my family (wife, BIL and MIL) with those opinions and I made them leave.\n\nThey told me I was punishing them for having sympathy for my wife and for wanting better for her than her own mother does. They said I should have let my wife decide if they spoke out of turn. But she was upset. She simply knows I am happy to step in and deal. But was my reaction too harsh?

It's not up to them to decide what your MIL can or cannot afford to do, either in terms of money or time. You have done well for your wife here.

A lot of people often side with their parents, unfortunately. You made the right call, and you weren't too harsh, they have no right to meddle, and they were extremely rude.", "NTA I applaud your quick decisive action and standing up for your upset wife and entire family. Having rules and boundaries are so necessary to have healthy relationships. You knowing this and being able to stand up for them before your child is born is going to help you parent a lot better. I applaud you. You let your wife have her feelings you stood up and decided to be the person of action and make sure that people were separated and emotionally safe. It sounds like you and your wife need to have a discussion before people are allowed in the house of what set rules and boundaries are and share with family and visitors what those boundaries are ahead of time so they can make the decision whether or not to visit.", "NTA, clearly. But there's a major issue here - your parents are being ridiculous and I'd make very clear to them that it will never be tolerated. Because they'll keep pushing it. It's absolutely none of their business what your MIL does. And it isn't any grandparents job to offer childcare, and it's not any parents job to pay for a wedding. These things are nice, sure, but not everyone is in that position and no one has the right to demand these things from their relatives, and especially not the parents of the couple. What the hell is that about?? \n\nI also want to thank you for standing up for your wife. I can't tell you how many stories I hear of the husband's parents treating people rudely, and he cowers instead of confronting them and sticking up for his wife and her family. You did a good thing here, but I expect it's not over yet. You will need to set a hard boundary in the near future.

Really callous of your parents to act how they did. Good on you for standing up to them.", "NTA.  You would never just stand by and let a stranger attack your wife and her family verbally, why would you think it's wrong to defend her from people you know?\n\nBut even more so, since they are your parents, your wife would have held her tongue out of respect for you, not them.  So it was truly your responsibility to set the boundary and show your wife and parents that these insults and invasion of privacy would not be tolerated. \n\nGood for you.

As the saying goes, if you have nothing good to say, don't say it at all.", "NTA\n What your wife's mother is and isn't able to do is none of your parents business.

Your parents need to back off and accept that you do know your wife, her mother and her brother well enough to have their backs.

I would hope that they\u2019ve learned to not cross that boundary again or you\u2019re just going to keep doing it or go LC", "NTA. They wanted to force a pregnant woman to confront them if their opinions upset her. They wanted the mother of their grandchild to let them know if they crossed the line. They're fools and assholes. There is no reason to cause your wife such stress and its not good for the baby (whether pregnant or not, babies also sense a mother's stress as infants.) They don't have to care for or respect anyone but their nonchalance about hurting your wife while pregnant is pretty wild and out of line.\n\nOf course they are the ones who want to grandparent compete with a woman just trying to cope with trauma and poverty. My inlaws are the same people, honestly. My inlaws told me upon becoming engaged that I was finally joining a real family. One of their favorite pass times was to start conversations with \"what kind of mother/father/brother...\" before they criticize my relations with my family. Good for you for shutting it down. It always feels like a personal attack when my inlaws do this and my husband is not always prepared to address it. Thus I won't speak to my inlaws unless he is close enough to hold hands.

I've been a solo parent for most of my childrens' lives, since my oldest was 2 and my youngest 8 months old. They're now young adults.\n\n\n\nWhen I tried to date as an early-20s solo mom, most of the men who asked me out would tell me they weren't ready for kids or didn't want to date a single mom. Since I had kids and was a single mom, we didn't date. Not that I went on a lot of dates. But enough that I gave up after a couple years and focused on my kids, working, and school and stopped dating completely until the kids were adults. I especially had no life as I was taking care of my kids, working full time, and going to undergrad then grad school full time.\n\n\nNow that I'm 41 and my kids are grown, I'm out of school, and have two decent jobs, most single men my age are divorced or have kids who are toddlers through elementary school aged. And they always get upset at me when I refuse to date them. They say I'm a single mom. I should know how hard it is and not be prejudice. \n\n\n*Yes. I know how hard it is. Which is why I don't want to do it again.* \n\n\n\nI love being a mom. I loved being a solo parent for the most part. What I don't love is thinking about doing it all over again. I had my kids. I served my twenty years. What I don't want to do is have to do it again even as a stepmom. I don't want kids in my house. I don't want to have to do kid-friendly things. I don't want to monitor or be responsible for any kid for a long, long time.\n\n\nSure, if my kids have kids, I can help. But I'm not going to be a professional grandma. I will assist in any way I can, but I'm not going to put my life on hold *again* unless, God forbid, and emergency happens.\n\n\n\nNTA, OP. MIL deserves to move on with her life however she sees fit. Your family needs to butt out.", "Someone should point out to ops parents that they did far less for their child then mil ever did.
