{"id": 15206, "submission_id": "12sabl2", "title": "AITA for not allowing my son to go to his friend's house because of his parent's alternative lifestyle?", "selftext": "Over the current school year my 7 year old son has become good friends with a boy in his class. I've allowed the boy to visit for playdates at my home but made excuses when his mom invites my son to her house. I feel like a prude to say it, but I don't agree with their lifestyle and don't want my son exposed to whatever goes on in their house.\n\nThe boy's mom is in her early 30's and his father is around 60. They are also polyamorous, and another woman lives in their house, and she also has children with the father. The father has a lot of children, many of them adults now, and has grandchildren and a great-grandchild that are older than his youngest child. \n\nI don't want my son exposed to their family dynamic as I think having multiple partners living with your children is wrong and this will set a bad example for my son. He has already asked me questions because he has been confused about what his friend has told him and doesn't understand how his friend has 2 moms and a dad. \n\nI am also concerned about what he may see or hear at their home as they are very alternative parents. There are several teenagers who live in their home, and I would be concerned about how they would treat my son or what he would learn from them. The family has a bad reputation locally and I haven't heard great things. A mom friend of mine lives on their street and says they regularly have loud parties with all sorts of people there and the kids are constantly riding dirt bikes up and down the street (they're semi-rural but still it's noisy). The mom seems very nice, and the boy has been polite and mostly well behaved at my home (some swearing but after I told him we don't allow it he stopped).\n\nThe last time I turned down they boy's mom's offer to a playdate she wasn't taking no for an answer. The mom told me she could do anytime and day, would pick him up and drop him off. I couldn't say no so I told her I would get back to her and have been avoiding her ever since. My son has also been begging to go over to his friend's house as his friend told him that his mom had asked, and I said no. He's brought it up a lot and has called me rude names over it. Apparently, his friend has a skate ramp in his backyard, as well as a tree house, trampoline and zipline. To him that sounds awesome, to me it sounds dangerous.\n\nMy husband thinks I'm being an asshole by not allowing the playdate for superficial reasons and that I'm upsetting our son for no reason. He admits he shares my concerns over the polyamorous relationship the parents have and isn't sure our son she be exposed to it but argues he already has been exposed from his friend who talks to him about it. Am I the asshole for denying a playdate? I'm not stopping them from being friends and still allow they boy around my house. I don't see why it matters where they play and therefor would prefer it happening in my home where it is safer.", "created_utc": 1681938715, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12sabl2/aita_for_not_allowing_my_son_to_go_to_his_friends/", "score": 112, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Until....\n\n> in my home where it is safer.\n\nYTA. I understand that you have your morals/ethics and you don't agree with those of the other parents. However, that doesn't mean yours are better or safer. Polyamory would not work for me. Doesn't mean it doesn't work perfectly well for others. I think it has a stigma it doesn't deserve and you are reinforcing that.", "YTA. Do you also keep your son away from anyone in the LGBT community because you don\u2019t want to explain it to him? You sound like that type of person. Your family dynamic is the only correct way to live, right? Jfc. Your kid is going to be just as intolerant and closed-minded as you if you never expose him to people with different lifestyles than yours.", "My grandkids have an uncle who is poly. He\u2019s in a throuple. The kids of their own accord realized that this is kind of unusual but they don\u2019t care. They love their three \u201cfuncles\u201d and it hasn\u2019t created an problems. They easily accept that some people do things differently from the typical. \n\nThey also have gay relatives and it doesn\u2019t faze them. They\u2019re taught that love is love. No one is trying to \u201crecruit\u201d anyone.", "NAH- I can understand why you are concerned, but the only way to adress this problem is head-on. I think you yourself should go over to the house and stay there for the first playdate, you could bring a cake or whatnot so you and the mum can have tea and chat while the boys play. Then you will be able to see what your son could be exposed to at the house and decide what's best from there. Personally I think the biggest issue would be cleanliness, with that many people living in 1 house it surely can't be easy to keep the dirt away but then again that's not really a reason to tell your son he can't go either.", "YTA and this is no different than saying you wouldn\u2019t let your son go to a friends house cause they have gay parents. rather than have an open and honest conversation with your child about how some people love each other differently and form relationships differently, you\u2019d rather keep him sheltered and keep him from forming a strong friendship with a friend he obviously really likes and wants to spend time with.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't have a problem with the polyamory part. I'm more concerned about the family having a bad reputation in town, known for throwing loud parties with lots of people around. That's a red flag to me. \n\nIf it was just the poly/ age difference stuff I would say you should be more open minded, but everything you've mentioned all put together, well, that would make me concerned as well. \n\nUltimately, you have no obligation to send your son anywhere you don't want to, so,  NTA\n\nEdit- >I think having multiple partners living with your children is wrong \n\nYou're definitely the asshole for this. Mind your own business.", "YTA. What exactly do you think is going to happen? I highly doubt they would be going into specifics about who sleeps with who. \nYour son is going to have to realize that not everyone's family is exactly like his. \nIf you're going to continue to not allow the play dates, at least be honest with your kid and the other mother about why. If you feel strongly enough about it to ghost another parent and refuse to show your son to spend time with his friend, you should have no problem being honest about why. If explaining your reasons to the other mother or your son embarrasses you is because you know your reasons are petty and judgmental.", "NTA\nAs your son gets older hes going to be exposed to things you wont like or feel safe with. Right now hes 7. Stand your ground on what you feel comfortable with. But I would be honest with the Mom knowing that it probably will be the end of the boys friendship. The hard decisions are just beginning. Always.follow your gut instinct.", "NTA", "yes YTA", "NTA- he's only 7. If there is partying going on, he's not really able to get himself out of the situation if something goes wrong. I would not drop off a young child to anyone I do not know well, particularly if there are older teens in the house and semi-dangerous activities readily available. \n\nIf he was older, or you just were being judgy about their polyamory, I'd have a different answer.", "NTA", "YTA  \n\n\nIf you aren't comfortable with such things... it might be time to move out of Utah.", "YTA, you'd deny your kid a friendship over the parents' lifestyle, that won't affect you or your child.  That's a bit much.", "YTA\n\nYou sound very holier than thou.  Stop judging this family and the wonderful friendship their son has provided.  Would you make the same decision if it was a single mom?  A gay couple?  A trans parent?\n\n\nAnd don't judge because \"they have a good reputation.\" Have the whole family over for dinner and judge for yourself. Nothing you have said makes them sound like a bad family.  They are probably just parents doing the best they can just like you.", "Absolutely NTA.  You are concerned for your child, and your instinct is the way to go.  Follow your gut, Mama Bear.", "YTA. Families come in all shapes and sizes.  There's nothing objectively wrong with having multiple partners or children with multiple partners. If you don't like it, don't do it!  The cat is out of the bag - your kid knows his friend has two mom and a dad. To tell him otherwise its to lie.   \n\nHow do you explain it? \"Some people want multiple partners and some don't. They do, we don't.\" That's it. \n\nIf you have concerns about the family, then talk to the family. Use your words like the adult you claim to be.  Ask about their teenagers and their (objectively awesome) backyard.  Set ground rules like okay, son can go over, but can't go on the zipline until he's older. \n\nYour husband is right (except for his bigotry). \n\n Honestly, sounds like you're just jealous this family is way cooler than you'll ever be, LMAO.", "YTA.\n\nhe needs to learn that there are different type of people and family systems in the world. you can't keep him in a little bubble forever. why not sit down w/ the parents and discuss your concerns? or learn more about how their household works? Sounds like you need some major education on the poly lifestyle", "YTA could you compromise and allow him to go over but but also go yourself so you can keep an eye on him and maybe get to know the family better?", "YTA. Your son is making a friendship that he is not only excited for, but could also enhance his view of the way other families and individuals in society exist. Not everyone fits, not needs to fit your white picket fence, 1 mum 1 dad 2 kids mold.", "YTA", "NTA.  While I am very liberal and believe kids should be exposed to many different things, this just sounds too over the top.  Not sure how to address it, though, with the son so that he would understand why he can't go over to the friend's.", "YTA. They live a poly lifestyle, who cares. Are you going to be concerned too if another friend has LGBTQ+ parents, or they\u2019re black?", "NTA", "NAH imo. An older man with significantly younger partners is something that you shouldn\u2019t be pressured into exposing your child to. I agree with some other comments that you go with your son a few times and get to know the other family so that you can feel more comfortable with the situation.", "YTA. Here's an idea....why not go over there for the first play date and get a lay of the land. Instead of listening to town gossips about \"how dangerous and bad\" this family is. Just because their family dynamic doesn't work for you, doesn't mean it's wrong. They could be a very nice family. But you have your blinders on because of the parents relationship status. Would you be this way if the kid had 2 moms or 2 dads. I'm gonna guess yes. Why not get to know the family before passing judgment. You know what they say when you assume. Don't you?", "NTA without question. You are not obligated to bring in any people into your life you don't want to.  Polyamory is not normal and shouldn't be exposed to children.", "NTA.", "YTA. It's ok to not understand peoples lifestyle choices, but judging them because of those choices isn't ok, especially when those choices are doing no direct harm. I totally get the safety concerns, but they feel like a convenient reason to double down on what seems to be a prejudice regarding polygamy. I get it...my partner is who I love and she's the only person I need in my life to be that intimate with. But that doesn't mean it's the only way, and some people need more than that to make all of their emotional nuances make sense and feel fulfilled. So what if your kid asks questions about it? In order to tackle life to the best of our abilities we need as much information as possible to make informed decisions. If your son has been presented with this situation but is left without all the data he may well come to an ill informed decision about what's going on. Please don't stop him going to his friends house, it'll create an imbalance in their relationship and that stuff can be hard to fix further down the line.", "YTA in so much as your child is old enough to have conversations with this kid and your child enjoys this child regardless of his family life. He has already asked questions you stated above and honestly you need to answer those, and honestly, or your child is going to go argue with this kid about this kid\u2019s life and that won\u2019t lead anywhere good. Your son seeing two women in a home with an older Dad and lots of kids will be different for sure but \u2018setting an example\u2019 means encouraging action by action. If you think your son will be encouraged to be polyamorous at age 8 because he sees his friend\u2019s family this way, that\u2019s just not true. Just as being in a home with two Dad\u2019s isn\u2019t going to make your son want to be gay. That isn\u2019t how this works. \n\nYou are well within your rights to contact the mom over concerns of dirt bike activity not being safe or concerns regarding who and how many people will be in and out of the home as that can pose safety issues. But their lifestyle has already been exposed to your child by this kid being honest about his life. You can\u2019t push that toothpaste back in the tube but you can have a good conversation with your kid and answer whatever questions HE has without pre-emptively answering questions he doesn\u2019t", "YTA man you're judgy as hell. Also your children will learn about polyamory eventually, whether you like it or not.", "NTA. Who the hell puts their business out their like this to where the parents of their classmates know and possibly the kids?", "YTA - the better approach, rather than sheltering your son from the realities of the world (which WILL cause more harm than good), would be to explain to him the differences in lifestyles and how families and people come in all shapes and sizes and everyone deserves to be treated with respect and kindness (which you are not doing). \n\nWorrying about there being older teens around is a great opportunity to talk to your son about what is appropriate and inappropriate behavior from older kids AND adults. As for the toys and activities you\u2019re worried about, speak with the mother and let tell her you\u2019re uncomfortable with your son participating in XYZ activities and you would like it if she refrained from allowing your son to participate in those.\n\nYTA..MAJORLY..for judging an \u201calternative\u201d lifestyle. \n\nAre you sure their reputation is actually bad or is it a bunch of puritanical judgmental AHs gossiping about the \u201calternative\u201d \u201cunholy\u201d family?", "NTA for feeling protective of your child. YTA for deciding ahead of time that your child would be exposed to this, that and the other. That is all in your imagination - you have no proof to back up any of that.\n\nYou say you don't see why it matters where they play. But it does matter to those kids. It is perfectly normal and natural for kids to play at one another's house. I think it is a huge compliment the mom wants your child over there. You must be raising a great kid.\n\nBottom line is: your child can be exposed to every one of the things your imagination listed (and more) in a household where there is not a polyamorous relationship going on, or age gap romance. You are not wrong to be cautious and concerned. But I think you are wrong to assume things with no proof or not seeing yourself. Why not invite yourself over for a cup of coffee while the kids play?", "YTA and I really agree with your husband. You are being way too protective. I understand that you want what's best for your son, but just turn things around.\n\nThe other kid's parents have this alternative lifestyle, yet they have no problem with their kid visiting you. They aren't afraid of any bad influences, even though they have a completely different way of living. Denying your kid the opportunity to explore different families isn't beneficial for his childhood\n\nWhy not go with him, or talk to the mother about your concerns?  I come from a 'normal' family and had a friend who's parents where full blown hippies and lived in a community. I played there a lot when I was young. Another friend was a very strict Muslim. I played with him a lot too. In the end these kind of experiences really make kids be more understanding and tolerant towards others", "YTA. People lead different lives there\u2019s no reason to shield your son from it, from being friends with this kid he already knows anyway. Polyamory isn\u2019t wrong you just don\u2019t like it.", "YTA\n\n\u201cdont want my son exposed to them\u201d\n\n\u201cset a bad example for my son\u201d\n\n\u201calready asked me questions because he\u2019s been confused\u201d (tones negatively)\n\nhmmm where have i heard this before, oh ye, racism, homophobia, transphobia etc. ye this isnt any different", "You're letting local gossip prevent your son from having a friendship. YTA.", "I lean NTA, but I also think you should consider getting to know the family better since the boys seem to play so well together. Some of your characterizations are judgy and based on hearsay. Your son is 7, I don't think you need to have an in-depth conversation about polyamory with him. A simple \"some families look different and that's okay\" would probably be sufficient.\n\nWhy can't you go with him to their house on a playdate? It is not common where I live to just drop your kid off at a house for a playdate, especially a 7 year old. A supervised playdate would allow you to get a better sense of the home environment so you don't have to rely on gossip and can make a more informed choice on how you can foster your sons' friendship.", "NTA. You are allowed to set your boundaries. You\u2019ll get a lot of YTA here because people won\u2019t like you daring to criticize polyamory but too bad for them. \n\nStand your ground.", "NAH.\n\nBut you are potentially over-protective.  Seems like a great opportunity to have a discussion with your child about your family values and expectations.  And remind them that others my have different views, and while they are free to have their own views, it doesn't change your expectations.\n\nUsing your son's friends swearing as an example, they already \"get it\" (to some extent). You let him know that swearing isn't allowed at your house, and sounds like he's respected that.  Do you think your son is less capable of understanding and following expectations?\n\nLastly, you are worried about what \"might\" happen.  There might be no need for concern or your son might get a chance to show they are more mature than you realize. Or if your fears come true, you can remind your son about your family values and expectations, and if that isn't working - then you have justification to be more concerned.", "YTA. Tell your kid that \u2018families are all different\u2019. You seem to be throwing in the \u2018safety\u2019 issues to make yourself feel better. You know the real reason is because you are judging their lifestyle, so why even mention those things?", "It's your right to keep your kid from going somewhere you aren't sure he'll be safe. However, polyamory isn't a red flag. Having a large mixed family isn't a red flag. Dirtbiking and having awesome fun equipment in the backyard aren't red flags. Sounds like you're judging this situation based on superficialities. Have you considered going over, introducing yourself, and getting to know your kid's friend's parents and household? Then you can get a sense for what they're actually like. You can also discuss specific boundaries for if and when your kid visits, such as which awesome backyard activities he will enjoy. Until then, YTA.", "NTA", "YMBTAH;  Why don't you talk to the mother and express your concerns, with her lifestyle they may be used to being shunned which isn't the best. But that being said she may be open to explaining or being more understanding of your concerns.  Talking is better than assuming and you may actually gain a friend and find out that they are just like you (just a little different).  Things are changing and hiding your son is not always the way to go.\n\nGive them a chance to show you that they are also good people.", "YTA", "The family has a bad reputation\u2026.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike, a bad reputation for kids cracking their head open from using skate ramps, trampolines, and zip lines unsupervised?\n\nA bad reputation for giving kids drugs and alcohol? For leaving firearms out unattended? For being sexually inappropriate around 7-year-olds?\n\nOr a bad reputation solely based on having two moms and a senior citizen dad?\n\nIn other words, what are you really afraid of? If it\u2019s that your son will be in danger, NTA. If you\u2019re hung up on three adults in a consensual relationship, that\u2019s not a good reason to deprive your kid of buddy with a zip line.", "NTA-You are still letting them be friends and play at your house where it's safer. You don't need to let your kids play at any house or place that you're not comfortable with.", "From what I read YTA.\n\n\n>. The family has a bad reputation locally and I haven't heard great things. A mom friend of mine lives on their street and says they regularly have loud parties with all sorts of people there and the kids are constantly riding dirt bikes up and down the street\n\nThis could be a concern, but you cannot judge by rumours. They are inviting him to a playdate, not a loud party.\n\nLeave your bible at home and go with your son and see what it really is like.\n\nYou can of course set boundaries for your son, but first you need to know what you are talking about.", "NTA. Would you feel guilty if your concerns were because they had a religion you completely disagreed with? Or they were big hunters and your family was vegan? Your son is 7. He has his whole life for the world to expose him to all kinds of things. You have no idea what will or won\u2019t be said in that house when you\u2019re not there. And that\u2019s true of any house but when you can clearly see areas of concern it\u2019s wrong to ignore it. Now. That being said, I do think it would be a good idea to speak with the other mom when the children cannot hear and have an honest conversation about it. Go with your gut after the conversation but you really should talk to them", "NTA. You mentioned concerns about dangerous activities, so that\u2019s reason enough.\n\nBut why not just let the mom know you\u2019d like to come and join your son so you get to know them - double playdate? \n\nWhile that lifestyle may not be yours (or mine, so I\u2019m just speaking from a place of tolerance) perhaps spending time there would give you more of a chance to make a decision about whether the playdates should continue.\n\nJust an option that allows a win all the way around.", "I\u2019m going with YTA \n\nYou sound how my mom sounded about me wanting to hang out with friends who had divorced parents/blended families and non-religious families.\n\nWhy not use this situation to educate your son on the fact that a relationship isn\u2019t always one woman and one man? Why not let him go over and play and stay for awhile to observe the dynamic instead of making judgements from afar?", "YTA - your child is going to be exposed to these things at some point in their life anyway. This gives you an opportunity to speak to your child about it and show them that we can be kind and accepting of other lifestyles even if we do not choose to live the same way. \n\nIf you are that concerned, why don\u2019t you offer to accompany him on the play date. That way you can see for yourself if it\u2019s a bad situation, and you can show you son an example of being kind to people who are different. \n\nIf it goes well, you can feel good about doing it again and letting your child have the friends that he choose. If it does not go well,  then you have a concrete reason to explain to your son why it\u2019s no longer and option rather than hearsay.", "YTA. You're being extremely petty honestly. Just let him go over to the house. If he has questions, just answer them. Just tell him that the parents have a different dynamic that you might not agree with.", "Your son has already been \"exposed\" to their \"lifestyle\". He has spoken to his friend, and seems to have questions. \nNow is the time for you to decide what kind of parent you want to be. Do you ignore reality? Do you shield your child from anything that might confuse him? Do you just deny the existence of the things you disapprove of? Be honest with us, and with yourself: what are you really afraid of? \nAre you afraid your son is going to be mistreated, or abused in any way? Are you afraid he is going to be convinced to become polyamorous? Are you afraid he is going to see polyamorous relationships as \"normal\"? \n\nPolyamorous families exist. Lgbtq families exist. Blended families exist. Unconventional families exist. Multigenerational households exists. Your son is going to be in contact with these families. How he reacts will mostly depend on how you deal with the current situation. Do you teach him to be open minded and tolerant of others? Do you teach him to have values? \n\nNAH, really. You want to protect your son, and that's a valid instinct. But denial and intolerance are not the way to go.", "YTA What is the actual fear here that your kid will become accepting and tolerant to those with other life styles????? Are you going to make it so he can\u2019t go to any friends houses if the kids have siblings that are teenagers?? If you don\u2019t want him to go in the zip line/trampoline/ramp/riding dirt bikes then fair enough but just tell the parents you don\u2019t want them to do that? You can also always just go to their house with him, spend some time getting to know these people yourself. I have a feeling that this rural area is full of people like you who don\u2019t actually know anything about their character and are just judging based on their family dynamic", "NTA because some of your reasons aren't superficial (some might be though). Your son already has heard about their family so having to answer more questions really isn't the issue any longer. Just do your best to answer his questions and show him that he can come to you with them without you being upset. \n\nIf you have safety concerns because unless they've taken the right precautions the trampoline and zip line might be dangerous (my parents had those in their backyard for some of the grandkids and it can be done safely). I think one solution to this might be just to explain to her that you're a worrier and you'd like to go over and hang out with everyone for the first time. \n\nPutting it back on you takes some of the sting out of it but she already knows you don't trust your kid around her. Then you go over and see how it feels to you. Rumors are terrible things and have a life of their own. They might all be nice people and even rough around the edges teens can be good around little kids. \n\nAt this point the only thing you have to lose is chasing away your son's friend for reasons he can't understand.", "YTA\n\nYou're closed minded and bigoted and you want your son to be just as close minded.\n\nHe's not going to know who is whose partner. He's just going to enjoy playing with his friend. It's not like these people are going to take him in the bedroom to witness whatever they do behind closed doors.", "NTA. That whole dynamic isn\u2019t healthy i don\u2019t care how many people try to say it is.", "YTA\n\nThis is a growth opportunity for your son AND for you.\nSomething you could have conversations about, and do some reflections with.\nMaybe you could try to spend some time with the mom and get to know her?\n\nFor me, it sounds very much like a \u201cfear of the unknown / anything unknown is bad\u201d situation", "YTA.

Invite her  for coffee when the kids are in school.  Ask questions, but not in a judgemental way.  Because I have questions. \n\nJealousy? Why such an older man? Who disciplines whose children? What would your son be exposed to at their home? PDA, nudity, ....I  think your son would be curious about having two moms and a dad, but once he saw it, he wouldn't even blink an eye.\n\nMy biggest concern would be all the different people in the house coming and going. They are all strangers to you. NTA, but your husband seems to have a laissez faire attitude to your son spending time with strangers just because they have cool toys.", "**NTA.** I understand your concerns, but you're over worrying about what your son will see or learn. \n\nYou can go with him if that makes you feel better. You can let him go and see what he says or asks when he returns. Never offer more information when your child asks a question. Keep it short and simple. Q: \"Why my friend has 2 moms and 1 dad?\" A: Not all families are the same and that's the way his family is.\n\nFor the people calling this mom so ugly names, it's totally unfair. A parent has the right to have fears and doubts. Obviously, she wants to do what's best for her son and that's why she's posting and asking. Don't be AH to the mom for asking.", "YTA. If you told me your main concern was the trampoline, zip line and, dirt bikes I would agree but your main concern is their sex lives? Gross.", "Nta, you don't agree with that lifestyle and thats fine. People that say yta are the ones that love shoving polyamory down everyone's throat, because they just cant accept that others dont agree with their views on marriage and relationships.", "NTA - honestly the 30 year age difference it what i would be worried about the most xD  \n\n\nits your kid and if your not comfortable to have them at someone's house for ANY reason, that's fine. wither its the lifestyle or the trampolines, your the parent and its your call.

I've allowed the boy to visit for playdates at my home but made excuses when his mom invites my son to her house. I feel like a prude to say it, but I don't agree with their lifestyle and don't want my son exposed to whatever goes on in their house.\n\nThe boy's mom is in her early 30's and his father is around 60. They are also polyamorous, and another woman lives in their house, and she also has children with the father. The father has a lot of children, many of them adults now, and has grandchildren and a great-grandchild that are older than his youngest child. \n\nI don't want my son exposed to their family dynamic as I think having multiple partners living with your children is wrong and this will set a bad example for my son. He has already asked me questions because he has been confused about what his friend has told him and doesn't understand how his friend has 2 moms and a dad. \n\nI am also concerned about what he may see or hear at their home as they are very alternative parents. There are several teenagers who live in their home, and I would be concerned about how they would treat my son or what he would learn from them. The family has a bad reputation locally and I haven't heard great things. A mom friend of mine lives on their street and says they regularly have loud parties with all sorts of people there and the kids are constantly riding dirt bikes up and down the street (they're semi-rural but still it's noisy). The mom seems very nice, and the boy has been polite and mostly well behaved at my home (some swearing but after I told him we don't allow it he stopped).\n\nThe last time I turned down they boy's mom's offer to a playdate she wasn't taking no for an answer. The mom told me she could do anytime and day, would pick him up and drop him off. I couldn't say no so I told her I would get back to her and have been avoiding her ever since. My son has also been begging to go over to his friend's house as his friend told him that his mom had asked, and I said no. He's brought it up a lot and has called me rude names over it. Apparently, his friend has a skate ramp in his backyard, as well as a tree house, trampoline and zipline. To him that sounds awesome, to me it sounds dangerous.\n\nMy husband thinks I'm being an asshole by not allowing the playdate for superficial reasons and that I'm upsetting our son for no reason. He admits he shares my concerns over the polyamorous relationship the parents have and isn't sure our son she be exposed to it but argues he already has been exposed from his friend who talks to him about it. Am I the asshole for denying a playdate? I'm not stopping them from being friends and still allow they boy around my house. I don't see why it matters where they play and therefor would prefer it happening in my home where it is safer.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA and a judgmental one at that. All indications (boy is mannerly, well behaved, no problems in school) seem to be that he\u2019s been brought up well but you would rather listen to the town gossip instead because that\u2019s juicy and it allows you a sense of superiority. Why don\u2019t you just bite the bullet and ask the mom if you can meet her prior to setting up a play date? You might be surprised. And you wouldn\u2019t have to see your son lose a good friend because of your bigotry.", "YTA.\nSo because they're polyamorous, they're going to be fucking on every surface in front of the children are they? Behave yourself. You're not worried about your son, you're offended that these people have a life that works differently to yours.\n\nThey sound happy.\nYou sound ignorant and rude.\nImagine being this het up about your son witnessing a functioning household that loves one another and not realising you're an AH.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t let my child around that either. The polyamory thing is strange. Anyone who says it isn\u2019t weird is kidding themselves. You\u2019re doing a good job as a parent protecting your kid from weirdos.", "YTA, not for your concerns, I totally understand the concerns of safety with the number of kids in the home, the activities from the ramps, dirt bikes, etc. I also understand your concerns for a 60 year old man having two potentially much younger partners in the home (I only saw one of the women's age being 30 and not the others) but instead of offering to meet with them to see if your concerns are justified or not, you're basing your decision on hearsay from around town (which seems mostly about the older kids' dirt bikes and loud parties being annoying) I'm not saying you should send your son over there without meeting them, but maybe meet them somewhere neutral so you can make a decision based off of who they actually are instead of just what you've heard. If meeting them doesn't make you feel any better about your son being around them then fine, you're protecting your kid, but you're doing so based off of actual information instead of rumors and avoiding them so you don't have to explain why you're uncomfortable with it.", "You are 100% the asshole.", "YTA. As much as you may want to, you can\u2019t protect your son from the world. Just because you see something in your environment doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to strive for it. My brother dated a girl whose parents were swingers and it was well known and she never once did or said anything that made anyone uncomfortable. She was actually a lovely girl. I can\u2019t imagine if people had refused to let her friends go to her house (though I\u2019m sure there were some) when she has no control over what decisions her parents make for their own personal, romantic lives.", "The solution here is to say he can come over, but you want to hang out, you'll drop him off and can chat with the mom while the kids play, and then take him home.\n\nThis way you can see for yourself what the actual dynamic in the home is like.\n\nWe are not polyamorous, and my husband is only 3 years older than me, but we have a treehouse and a zip line, and my husband makes the kids wooden axes and swords that they then use to \"mine\" the yard in one area that's all dirt.  But we keep a close eye on them, and they only zipline when we have two adults out there...  \n\nthen if you hate their home dynamic and want to tell your son he can't go over, you will have legitimate reasons to give him, and maybe he'll understand!", "YTA - there are all kinds of families in this world. How are you planning on teaching diversity and acceptance without exposing him to other types of families?", "YTA you are a prude, why not go over with him, broaden your horizons and find out for yourself rather than just listen to local gossip. Different isn\u2019t necessarily bad. A family with skate ramp, trampoline and treehouse seem invested in their kids, I\u2019d rather mine were out doing all that than stick to their screens tbh.\n\nYou can\u2019t stop him being exposed to \u2018lifestyles\u2019 you may not agree with but you have a chance to explain things in a non-judgemental way. E.g. all families are different, some are blended, some are single parents, some kids have same sex parents, some parents have more than one partner and that\u2019s their choice and, as long as everyone is treated with love, kindness and respect, that\u2019s fine.\n\nIf it does turn out this family demonstrates actual negative qualities and values then that\u2019s a teaching moment too.", "YTA because you aren\u2019t being honest with the other family. If your honest reasons make you feel like a jerk, maybe they\u2019re jerky reasons. If you think they\u2019re legitimate reasons, speak them out with your whole chest and own them. You\u2019re a coward otherwise.", "YTA nothing wrong with having more then one partner. Nothing is wrong being in poly relationships or swingers.", "yta", "I don't think you are being an AH, but you are being overly protective and ineffectively sheltering your son. Your son already knows about his friend's family. You have described your son's friend as polite and well behaved. Your son will be exposed to polyamory (and what honestly sounds like religious polygamy in some ways) at multiple points in his life. So there is really no great reason for not letting him go to his friend's house.\n\nLetting him go there would give you a great opportunity for *you* to teach him about polyamory, teach him your beliefs about, and teach him how to be tolerant of other people who make different choices than you do.", "YTA I genuinely forget that some people are willing living such a sheltered life as OP is.", "NAH\n\nThe family has a very bad reputation locally and you say you've heard some disturbing things.  That alone is a good reason to limit or supervise contact.\n\nI would have a lot of questions about how old the mother of this kid was when she got romantically involved with her husband as I don't see a lot of 20 year olds interested in 50+ year old men.   But I live in Utah, where this set up would scream \"child brides in forced marriage.\"\n\nIf you aren't comfortable asking those questions or telling the other mom about your concerns, you could simply tell her that you've heard they have a skate ramp and motorbikes, and those make you very nervous.  Go over and supervise a couple playdates.\n\nThat will give you more information to make an educated decision on whether this family is one you are okay with or not instead of relying on rumors.", "NAH\n\n>Apparently, his friend has a skate ramp in his backyard, as well as a tree house, trampoline and zipline. To him that sounds awesome, to me it sounds dangerous.\n\nFirst of all, that *does* sound awesome. \n\nIt's tough sending your kids over to someone else's home. 7 is still really young. My daughters are 8 and 9 and I don't think polyamory would be all that difficult to explain (Some people love multiple people! Cool, huh?) However, a 60ish year old man with multiple partners significantly younger than him would give me pause. \n\nBut why not go with him? See for yourself what the home is like and how they treat your son and his friend? Or meet the mom at the park for a neutral playdate? All you have to say is that you're not ready for him to go places without you yet and you'd rather get to know her first.", "YTA why not go over with your son and see how it is for yourself? You guys can always leave if your uncomfortable/find it to be unsafe and you may even have a good time.", "How about going over there with him. Your making sure he\u2019s safe and you can talk to the mom", "YTA\n\nWhat's the actual fear here, that they're going to try to brainwash him or something? You're making your case worse; nothing will make him more open to polyamory than you keeping him away only for him later to understand it's just a personal choice.", "You can set any rules you like, but YTA. There's nothing to protect your son from, there's no abuse going on. Do you think your 7-year-old is suddenly going to have multiple wives in a few weeks time? There's two living moms to look after the kids, lots of brutes and sisters to play with, and it looks like lots of fun stuff to do.", "YTA\n\nNothing you've said makes it sound like an unsafe or unhealthy place for a child. It's all just \"But my pearls! They need to be clutched!\"\n\nMy advice is get over yourself. Your way is not the only way. And, frankly, I can't believe it's taken you this long to learn that.", "YTA. I could understand feeling like safety is an issue if it was something like unsecured firearms in the house, but it seems like you are more concerned with... People showing affection? Language you don't approve of? What?", "It's difficult because, as a parent, I understand wanting your children to have good influences around.\n\nUltimately, you're not comfortable and you don't need a reason, so NTA.\n\nThis said, I will tell you this: my daughter is only 6, and she's already getting exposed to all kinds of things in grade 1. I was tucking her into bed recently, I usually lie there with her for 5 minutes or so and talk about our days or whatever, and as I was leaving the room, she asked me \"can girls be boys, or boys be girls?\" woooooooh boy. You are 6! I was hoping to avoid dealing with this question until maybe 8 or 10, but I think that was wildly naive of me.\n\nWhile I have no problem with what anyone chooses to do, I really don't care what you do, you do do, *that* is a very, very loaded and complex question that requires a complex explanation. So, I climbed back into bed with her and explained as best as I can that most people identify as the gender they are born as, but some people don't, and that doesn't make them bad or wrong or anything other than people - some of them *can be* bad people, just the same as any other group of people, but most are just trying to live their lives and enjoy their time on the Earth, just the same as most everyone else.\n\nThe whole point to my story is, they're going to be exposed to all kinds of things one way or another. If I was you, I'd probably invite myself for coffee. At least then, you are present when he is getting exposed, you know what he saw and what he did, and you are more prepared to answer any questions he may have. I'd much prefer to introduce that to my kids while being there, rather than having them hear who knows what at school, and then come home and ask you a loaded question that you have no context for and have no clue where that thought came from.", "Nta.
