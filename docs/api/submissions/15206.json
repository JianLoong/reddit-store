{"id": 15206, "submission_id": "12sabl2", "title": "AITA for not allowing my son to go to his friend's house because of his parent's alternative lifestyle?", "selftext": "Over the current school year my 7 year old son has become good friends with a boy in his class. I've allowed the boy to visit for playdates at my home but made excuses when his mom invites my son to her house. I feel like a prude to say it, but I don't agree with their lifestyle and don't want my son exposed to whatever goes on in their house.\n\nThe boy's mom is in her early 30's and his father is around 60. They are also polyamorous, and another woman lives in their house, and she also has children with the father. The father has a lot of children, many of them adults now, and has grandchildren and a great-grandchild that are older than his youngest child. \n\nI don't want my son exposed to their family dynamic as I think having multiple partners living with your children is wrong and this will set a bad example for my son. He has already asked me questions because he has been confused about what his friend has told him and doesn't understand how his friend has 2 moms and a dad. \n\nI am also concerned about what he may see or hear at their home as they are very alternative parents. There are several teenagers who live in their home, and I would be concerned about how they would treat my son or what he would learn from them. The family has a bad reputation locally and I haven't heard great things. A mom friend of mine lives on their street and says they regularly have loud parties with all sorts of people there and the kids are constantly riding dirt bikes up and down the street (they're semi-rural but still it's noisy). The mom seems very nice, and the boy has been polite and mostly well behaved at my home (some swearing but after I told him we don't allow it he stopped).\n\nThe last time I turned down they boy's mom's offer to a playdate she wasn't taking no for an answer. The mom told me she could do anytime and day, would pick him up and drop him off. I couldn't say no so I told her I would get back to her and have been avoiding her ever since. My son has also been begging to go over to his friend's house as his friend told him that his mom had asked, and I said no. He's brought it up a lot and has called me rude names over it. Apparently, his friend has a skate ramp in his backyard, as well as a tree house, trampoline and zipline. To him that sounds awesome, to me it sounds dangerous.\n\nMy husband thinks I'm being an asshole by not allowing the playdate for superficial reasons and that I'm upsetting our son for no reason. He admits he shares my concerns over the polyamorous relationship the parents have and isn't sure our son she be exposed to it but argues he already has been exposed from his friend who talks to him about it. Am I the asshole for denying a playdate? I'm not stopping them from being friends and still allow they boy around my house. I don't see why it matters where they play and therefor would prefer it happening in my home where it is safer.", "created_utc": 1681938715, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12sabl2/aita_for_not_allowing_my_son_to_go_to_his_friends/", "score": 3606, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Until....\n\n> in my home where it is safer.\n\nYTA. I understand that you have your morals/ethics and you don't agree with those of the other parents. However, that doesn't mean yours are better or safer. Polyamory would not work for me. Doesn't mean it doesn't work perfectly well for others. I think it has a stigma it doesn't deserve and you are reinforcing that.\n\nEDIT: If you mean safer because you don't have a skate ramp, zip line, trampoline, or treehouse in your backyard; then you're just being overprotective. I can tell you from personal experience that only works until you don't have control over him (and YTA still).", "YTA. Do you also keep your son away from anyone in the LGBT community because you don\u2019t want to explain it to him? You sound like that type of person. Your family dynamic is the only correct way to live, right? Jfc. Your kid is going to be just as intolerant and closed-minded as you if you never expose him to people with different lifestyles than yours.", "My grandkids have an uncle who is poly. He\u2019s in a throuple. The kids of their own accord realized that this is kind of unusual but they don\u2019t care. They love their three \u201cfuncles\u201d and it hasn\u2019t created an problems. They easily accept that some people do things differently from the typical. \n\nThey also have gay relatives and it doesn\u2019t faze them. They\u2019re taught that love is love. No one is trying to \u201crecruit\u201d anyone.", "NAH- I can understand why you are concerned, but the only way to adress this problem is head-on. I think you yourself should go over to the house and stay there for the first playdate, you could bring a cake or whatnot so you and the mum can have tea and chat while the boys play. Then you will be able to see what your son could be exposed to at the house and decide what's best from there. Personally I think the biggest issue would be cleanliness, with that many people living in 1 house it surely can't be easy to keep the dirt away but then again that's not really a reason to tell your son he can't go either.", "YTA and this is no different than saying you wouldn\u2019t let your son go to a friends house cause they have gay parents. rather than have an open and honest conversation with your child about how some people love each other differently and form relationships differently, you\u2019d rather keep him sheltered and keep him from forming a strong friendship with a friend he obviously really likes and wants to spend time with.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't have a problem with the polyamory part. I'm more concerned about the family having a bad reputation in town, known for throwing loud parties with lots of people around. That's a red flag to me. \n\nIf it was just the poly/ age difference stuff I would say you should be more open minded, but everything you've mentioned all put together, well, that would make me concerned as well. \n\nUltimately, you have no obligation to send your son anywhere you don't want to, so,  NTA\n\nEdit- >\"I think having multiple partners living with your children is wrong\"\n\nYou're definitely the asshole for this. Mind your own business.", "YTA. What exactly do you think is going to happen? I highly doubt they would be going into specifics about who sleeps with who. \nYour son is going to have to realize that not everyone's family is exactly like his. \nIf you're going to continue to not allow the play dates, at least be honest with your kid and the other mother about why. If you feel strongly enough about it to ghost another parent and refuse to show your son to spend time with his friend, you should have no problem being honest about why. If explaining your reasons to the other mother or your son embarrasses you is because you know your reasons are petty and judgmental.", "NTA\nAs your son gets older hes going to be exposed to things you wont like or feel safe with. Right now hes 7. Stand your ground on what you feel comfortable with. But I would be honest with the Mom knowing that it probably will be the end of the boys friendship. The hard decisions are just beginning. Always.follow your gut instinct.", "NTA", "yes YTA", "NTA- he's only 7. If there is partying going on, he's not really able to get himself out of the situation if something goes wrong. I would not drop off a young child to anyone I do not know well, particularly if there are older teens in the house and semi-dangerous activities readily available. \n\nIf he was older, or you just were being judgy about their polyamory, I'd have a different answer.", "NTA", "YTA  \n\n\nIf you aren't comfortable with such things... it might be time to move out of Utah.", "YTA, you'd deny your kid a friendship over the parents' lifestyle, that won't affect you or your child.  That's a bit much.", "YTA\n\nYou sound very holier than thou.  Stop judging this family and the wonderful friendship their son has provided.  Would you make the same decision if it was a single mom?  A gay couple?  A trans parent?\n\n\nAnd don't judge because \"they have a good reputation.\" Have the whole family over for dinner and judge for yourself. Nothing you have said makes them sound like a bad family.  They are probably just parents doing the best they can just like you.", "Absolutely NTA.  You are concerned for your child, and your instinct is the way to go.  Follow your gut, Mama Bear.", "YTA. Families come in all shapes and sizes.  There's nothing objectively wrong with having multiple partners or children with multiple partners. If you don't like it, don't do it!  The cat is out of the bag - your kid knows his friend has two mom and a dad. To tell him otherwise its to lie.   \n\nHow do you explain it? \"Some people want multiple partners and some don't. They do, we don't.\" That's it. \n\nIf you have concerns about the family, then talk to the family. Use your words like the adult you claim to be.  Ask about their teenagers and their (objectively awesome) backyard.  Set ground rules like okay, son can go over, but can't go on the zipline until he's older. \n\nYour husband is right (except for his bigotry). \n\n Honestly, sounds like you're just jealous this family is way cooler than you'll ever be, LMAO.", "YTA.\n\nhe needs to learn that there are different type of people and family systems in the world. you can't keep him in a little bubble forever. why not sit down w/ the parents and discuss your concerns? or learn more about how their household works? Sounds like you need some major education on the poly lifestyle", "YTA could you compromise and allow him to go over but but also go yourself so you can keep an eye on him and maybe get to know the family better?", "YTA. Your son is making a friendship that he is not only excited for, but could also enhance his view of the way other families and individuals in society exist. Not everyone fits, not needs to fit your white picket fence, 1 mum 1 dad 2 kids mold.", "YTA", "NTA.  While I am very liberal and believe kids should be exposed to many different things, this just sounds too over the top.  Not sure how to address it, though, with the son so that he would understand why he can't go over to the friend's.", "YTA. They live a poly lifestyle, who cares. Are you going to be concerned too if another friend has LGBTQ+ parents, or they\u2019re black?", "NTA", "NAH imo. An older man with significantly younger partners is something that you shouldn\u2019t be pressured into exposing your child to. I agree with some other comments that you go with your son a few times and get to know the other family so that you can feel more comfortable with the situation.", "YTA. Here's an idea....why not go over there for the first play date and get a lay of the land. Instead of listening to town gossips about \"how dangerous and bad\" this family is. Just because their family dynamic doesn't work for you, doesn't mean it's wrong. They could be a very nice family. But you have your blinders on because of the parents relationship status. Would you be this way if the kid had 2 moms or 2 dads. I'm gonna guess yes. Why not get to know the family before passing judgment. You know what they say when you assume. Don't you?", "NTA without question. You are not obligated to bring in any people into your life you don't want to.  Polyamory is not normal and shouldn't be exposed to children.", "NTA.", "YTA. It's ok to not understand peoples lifestyle choices, but judging them because of those choices isn't ok, especially when those choices are doing no direct harm. I totally get the safety concerns, but they feel like a convenient reason to double down on what seems to be a prejudice regarding polygamy. I get it...my partner is who I love and she's the only person I need in my life to be that intimate with. But that doesn't mean it's the only way, and some people need more than that to make all of their emotional nuances make sense and feel fulfilled. So what if your kid asks questions about it? In order to tackle life to the best of our abilities we need as much information as possible to make informed decisions. If your son has been presented with this situation but is left without all the data he may well come to an ill informed decision about what's going on. Please don't stop him going to his friends house, it'll create an imbalance in their relationship and that stuff can be hard to fix further down the line.", "YTA in so much as your child is old enough to have conversations with this kid and your child enjoys this child regardless of his family life. He has already asked questions you stated above and honestly you need to answer those, and honestly, or your child is going to go argue with this kid about this kid\u2019s life and that won\u2019t lead anywhere good. Your son seeing two women in a home with an older Dad and lots of kids will be different for sure but \u2018setting an example\u2019 means encouraging action by action. If you think your son will be encouraged to be polyamorous at age 8 because he sees his friend\u2019s family this way, that\u2019s just not true. Just as being in a home with two Dad\u2019s isn\u2019t going to make your son want to be gay. That isn\u2019t how this works. \n\nYou are well within your rights to contact the mom over concerns of dirt bike activity not being safe or concerns regarding who and how many people will be in and out of the home as that can pose safety issues. But their lifestyle has already been exposed to your child by this kid being honest about his life. You can\u2019t push that toothpaste back in the tube but you can have a good conversation with your kid and answer whatever questions HE has without pre-emptively answering questions he doesn\u2019t", "YTA man you're judgy as hell. Also your children will learn about polyamory eventually, whether you like it or not.", "NTA. Who the hell puts their business out their like this to where the parents of their classmates know and possibly the kids?", "YTA - the better approach, rather than sheltering your son from the realities of the world (which WILL cause more harm than good), would be to explain to him the differences in lifestyles and how families and people come in all shapes and sizes and everyone deserves to be treated with respect and kindness (which you are not doing). \n\nWorrying about there being older teens around is a great opportunity to talk to your son about what is appropriate and inappropriate behavior from older kids AND adults. As for the toys and activities you\u2019re worried about, speak with the mother and let tell her you\u2019re uncomfortable with your son participating in XYZ activities and you would like it if she refrained from allowing your son to participate in those.\n\nYTA..MAJORLY..for judging an \u201calternative\u201d lifestyle. \n\nAre you sure their reputation is actually bad or is it a bunch of puritanical judgmental AHs gossiping about the \u201calternative\u201d \u201cunholy\u201d family?", "NTA for feeling protective of your child. YTA for deciding ahead of time that your child would be exposed to this, that and the other. That is all in your imagination - you have no proof to back up any of that.\n\nYou say you don't see why it matters where they play. But it does matter to those kids. It is perfectly normal and natural for kids to play at one another's house. I think it is a huge compliment the mom wants your child over there. You must be raising a great kid.\n\nBottom line is: your child can be exposed to every one of the things your imagination listed (and more) in a household where there is not a polyamorous relationship going on, or age gap romance. You are not wrong to be cautious and concerned. But I think you are wrong to assume things with no proof or not seeing yourself. Why not invite yourself over for a cup of coffee while the kids play?", "YTA and I really agree with your husband. You are being way too protective. I understand that you want what's best for your son, but just turn things around.\n\nThe other kid's parents have this alternative lifestyle, yet they have no problem with their kid visiting you. They aren't afraid of any bad influences, even though they have a completely different way of living. Denying your kid the opportunity to explore different families isn't beneficial for his childhood\n\nWhy not go with him, or talk to the mother about your concerns?  I come from a 'normal' family and had a friend who's parents where full blown hippies and lived in a community. I played there a lot when I was young. Another friend was a very strict Muslim. I played with him a lot too. In the end these kind of experiences really make kids be more understanding and tolerant towards others", "YTA. People lead different lives there\u2019s no reason to shield your son from it, from being friends with this kid he already knows anyway. Polyamory isn\u2019t wrong you just don\u2019t like it.", "YTA\n\n\u201cdont want my son exposed to them\u201d\n\n\u201cset a bad example for my son\u201d\n\n\u201calready asked me questions because he\u2019s been confused\u201d (tones negatively)\n\nhmmm where have i heard this before, oh ye, racism, homophobia, transphobia etc. ye this isnt any different", "You're letting local gossip prevent your son from having a friendship. YTA.", "I lean NTA, but I also think you should consider getting to know the family better since the boys seem to play so well together. Some of your characterizations are judgy and based on hearsay. Your son is 7, I don't think you need to have an in-depth conversation about polyamory with him. A simple \"some families look different and that's okay\" would probably be sufficient.\n\nWhy can't you go with him to their house on a playdate? It is not common where I live to just drop your kid off at a house for a playdate, especially a 7 year old. A supervised playdate would allow you to get a better sense of the home environment so you don't have to rely on gossip and can make a more informed choice on how you can foster your sons' friendship.", "NTA. You are allowed to set your boundaries. You\u2019ll get a lot of YTA here because people won\u2019t like you daring to criticize polyamory but too bad for them. \n\nStand your ground.", "NAH.\n\nBut you are potentially over-protective.  Seems like a great opportunity to have a discussion with your child about your family values and expectations.  And remind them that others my have different views, and while they are free to have their own views, it doesn't change your expectations.\n\nUsing your son's friends swearing as an example, they already \"get it\" (to some extent). You let him know that swearing isn't allowed at your house, and sounds like he's respected that.  Do you think your son is less capable of understanding and following expectations?\n\nLastly, you are worried about what \"might\" happen.  There might be no need for concern or your son might get a chance to show they are more mature than you realize. Or if your fears come true, you can remind your son about your family values and expectations, and if that isn't working - then you have justification to be more concerned.", "YTA. Tell your kid that \u2018families are all different\u2019. You seem to be throwing in the \u2018safety\u2019 issues to make yourself feel better. You know the real reason is because you are judging their lifestyle, so why even mention those things?", "It's your right to keep your kid from going somewhere you aren't sure he'll be safe. However, polyamory isn't a red flag. Having a large mixed family isn't a red flag. Dirtbiking and having awesome fun equipment in the backyard aren't red flags. Sounds like you're judging this situation based on superficialities. Have you considered going over, introducing yourself, and getting to know your kid's friend's parents and household? Then you can get a sense for what they're actually like. You can also discuss specific boundaries for if and when your kid visits, such as which awesome backyard activities he will enjoy. Until then, YTA.", "NTA", "YMBTAH;  Why don't you talk to the mother and express your concerns, with her lifestyle they may be used to being shunned which isn't the best. But that being said she may be open to explaining or being more understanding of your concerns.  Talking is better than assuming and you may actually gain a friend and find out that they are just like you (just a little different).

For leaving firearms out unattended? For being sexually inappropriate around 7-year-olds?\n\nOr a bad reputation solely based on having two moms and a senior citizen dad?\n\nIn other words, what are you really afraid of? If it\u2019s that your son will be in danger, NTA.

You don't need to let your kids play at any house or place that you're not comfortable with.", "From what I read YTA.\n\n\n>. The family has a bad reputation locally and I haven't heard great things. A mom friend of mine lives on their street and says they regularly have loud parties with all sorts of people there and the kids are constantly riding dirt bikes up and down the street\n\nThis could be a concern, but you cannot judge by rumours. They are inviting him to a playdate, not a loud party.\n\nLeave your bible at home and go with your son and see what it really is like.\n\nYou can of course set boundaries for your son, but first you need to know what you are talking about.", "NTA. Would you feel guilty if your concerns were because they had a religion you completely disagreed with? Or they were big hunters and your family was vegan? Your son is 7. He has his whole life for the world to expose him to all kinds of things. You have no idea what will or won\u2019t be said in that house when you\u2019re not there. And that\u2019s true of any house but when you can clearly see areas of concern it\u2019s wrong to ignore it. Now. That being said, I do think it would be a good idea to speak with the other mom when the children cannot hear and have an honest conversation about it. Go with your gut after the conversation but you really should talk to them", "NTA. You mentioned concerns about dangerous activities, so that\u2019s reason enough.\n\nBut why not just let the mom know you\u2019d like to come and join your son so you get to know them - double playdate? \n\nWhile that lifestyle may not be yours (or mine, so I\u2019m just speaking from a place of tolerance) perhaps spending time there would give you more of a chance to make a decision about whether the playdates should continue.\n\nJust an option that allows a win all the way around.", "I\u2019m going with YTA \n\nYou sound how my mom sounded about me wanting to hang out with friends who had divorced parents/blended families and non-religious families.\n\nWhy not use this situation to educate your son on the fact that a relationship isn\u2019t always one woman and one man? Why not let him go over and play and stay for awhile to observe the dynamic instead of making judgements from afar?", "YTA - your child is going to be exposed to these things at some point in their life anyway.

That way you can see for yourself if it\u2019s a bad situation, and you can show you son an example of being kind to people who are different. \n\nIf it goes well, you can feel good about doing it again and letting your child have the friends that he choose. If it does not go well,  then you have a concrete reason to explain to your son why it\u2019s no longer and option rather than hearsay.", "YTA. You're being extremely petty honestly.

Are you afraid he is going to be convinced to become polyamorous? Are you afraid he is going to see polyamorous relationships as \"normal\"? \n\nPolyamorous families exist. Lgbtq families exist. Blended families exist. Unconventional families exist. Multigenerational households exists. Your son is going to be in contact with these families. How he reacts will mostly depend on how you deal with the current situation. Do you teach him to be open minded and tolerant of others? Do you teach him to have values? \n\nNAH, really. You want to protect your son, and that's a valid instinct. But denial and intolerance are not the way to go.", "YTA What is the actual fear here that your kid will become accepting and tolerant to those with other life styles????? Are you going to make it so he can\u2019t go to any friends houses if the kids have siblings that are teenagers?? If you don\u2019t want him to go in the zip line/trampoline/ramp/riding dirt bikes then fair enough but just tell the parents you don\u2019t want them to do that? You can also always just go to their house with him, spend some time getting to know these people yourself. I have a feeling that this rural area is full of people like you who don\u2019t actually know anything about their character and are just judging based on their family dynamic", "NTA because some of your reasons aren't superficial (some might be though). Your son already has heard about their family so having to answer more questions really isn't the issue any longer. Just do your best to answer his questions and show him that he can come to you with them without you being upset. \n\nIf you have safety concerns because unless they've taken the right precautions the trampoline and zip line might be dangerous (my parents had those in their backyard for some of the grandkids and it can be done safely). I think one solution to this might be just to explain to her that you're a worrier and you'd like to go over and hang out with everyone for the first time. \n\nPutting it back on you takes some of the sting out of it but she already knows you don't trust your kid around her. Then you go over and see how it feels to you. Rumors are terrible things and have a life of their own.

I've allowed the boy to visit for playdates at my home but made excuses when his mom invites my son to her house. I feel like a prude to say it, but I don't agree with their lifestyle and don't want my son exposed to whatever goes on in their house.\n\nThe boy's mom is in her early 30's and his father is around 60. They are also polyamorous, and another woman lives in their house, and she also has children with the father. The father has a lot of children, many of them adults now, and has grandchildren and a great-grandchild that are older than his youngest child. \n\nI don't want my son exposed to their family dynamic as I think having multiple partners living with your children is wrong and this will set a bad example for my son. He has already asked me questions because he has been confused about what his friend has told him and doesn't understand how his friend has 2 moms and a dad. \n\nI am also concerned about what he may see or hear at their home as they are very alternative parents. There are several teenagers who live in their home, and I would be concerned about how they would treat my son or what he would learn from them. The family has a bad reputation locally and I haven't heard great things. A mom friend of mine lives on their street and says they regularly have loud parties with all sorts of people there and the kids are constantly riding dirt bikes up and down the street (they're semi-rural but still it's noisy). The mom seems very nice, and the boy has been polite and mostly well behaved at my home (some swearing but after I told him we don't allow it he stopped).\n\nThe last time I turned down they boy's mom's offer to a playdate she wasn't taking no for an answer. The mom told me she could do anytime and day, would pick him up and drop him off. I couldn't say no so I told her I would get back to her and have been avoiding her ever since. My son has also been begging to go over to his friend's house as his friend told him that his mom had asked, and I said no. He's brought it up a lot and has called me rude names over it. Apparently, his friend has a skate ramp in his backyard, as well as a tree house, trampoline and zipline. To him that sounds awesome, to me it sounds dangerous.\n\nMy husband thinks I'm being an asshole by not allowing the playdate for superficial reasons and that I'm upsetting our son for no reason. He admits he shares my concerns over the polyamorous relationship the parents have and isn't sure our son she be exposed to it but argues he already has been exposed from his friend who talks to him about it. Am I the asshole for denying a playdate? I'm not stopping them from being friends and still allow they boy around my house. I don't see why it matters where they play and therefor would prefer it happening in my home where it is safer.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Why don\u2019t you just bite the bullet and ask the mom if you can meet her prior to setting up a play date? You might be surprised. And you wouldn\u2019t have to see your son lose a good friend because of your bigotry.", "YTA.\nSo because they're polyamorous, they're going to be fucking on every surface in front of the children are they? Behave yourself. You're not worried about your son, you're offended that these people have a life that works differently to yours.\n\nThey sound happy.\nYou sound ignorant and rude.\nImagine being this het up about your son witnessing a functioning household that loves one another and not realising you're an AH.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t let my child around that either. The polyamory thing is strange. Anyone who says it isn\u2019t weird is kidding themselves.

If meeting them doesn't make you feel any better about your son being around them then fine, you're protecting your kid, but you're doing so based off of actual information instead of rumors and avoiding them so you don't have to explain why you're uncomfortable with it.", "You are 100% the asshole.", "YTA. As much as you may want to, you can\u2019t protect your son from the world. Just because you see something in your environment doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to strive for it.

Your son already knows about his friend's family. You have described your son's friend as polite and well behaved. Your son will be exposed to polyamory (and what honestly sounds like religious polygamy in some ways) at multiple points in his life. So there is really no great reason for not letting him go to his friend's house.\n\nLetting him go there would give you a great opportunity for *you* to teach him about polyamory, teach him your beliefs about, and teach him how to be tolerant of other people who make different choices than you do.", "YTA I genuinely forget that some people are willing living such a sheltered life as OP is.", "NAH\n\nThe family has a very bad reputation locally and you say you've heard some disturbing things.  That alone is a good reason to limit or supervise contact.\n\nI would have a lot of questions about how old the mother of this kid was when she got romantically involved with her husband as I don't see a lot of 20 year olds interested in 50+ year old men.

I was tucking her into bed recently, I usually lie there with her for 5 minutes or so and talk about our days or whatever, and as I was leaving the room, she asked me \"can girls be boys, or boys be girls?\" woooooooh boy. You are 6! I was hoping to avoid dealing with this question until maybe 8 or 10, but I think that was wildly naive of me.\n\nWhile I have no problem with what anyone chooses to do, I really don't care what you do, you do do, *that* is a very, very loaded and complex question that requires a complex explanation. So, I climbed back into bed with her and explained as best as I can that most people identify as the gender they are born as, but some people don't, and that doesn't make them bad or wrong or anything other than people - some of them *can be* bad people, just the same as any other group of people, but most are just trying to live their lives and enjoy their time on the Earth, just the same as most everyone else.\n\nThe whole point to my story is, they're going to be exposed to all kinds of things one way or another.

There are dysfunctional and abusive poly relationships, but there are also supportive and healthy poly relationships, just like there are both healthy and unhealthy monogamous relationships. The fact that they are poly is not in and of itself cause for concern. The 'exposed to whatever goes on in their house' makes it sound as though you assume they're involved in nonstop orgies out in the open or something. I apologize if I'm misreading that, but I don't think the fact that they're polyamorous means there is any more chance of the kids being exposed to something sexual than there would be with a heterosexual couple. If you simply mean 'exposed' as in, 'aware of their existence'...well, the cat is already out of the bag on that one, and I don't think that's a bad thing. Kids need to learn that not every family works the same way as theirs does, and that's ok.\r  \n\r  \n\"There are several teenagers who live in their home, and I would be concerned about how they would treat my son or what he would learn from them.\"\n\nThis seems ridiculously overprotective.

I get that it's possible for a kid to fall out of a tree house or off a trampoline, but there is a certain amount of risk involved just in being alive. I spent a lot of time in treehouses growing up, and my family had a big trampoline, and neither I nor my sister were ever injured on it. The most serious injuries either of us ever got was tripping over a rug in the living room and cracking our skulls open on the TV stand (not at the same time, several years apart). The zip line I'm a little more understanding of; that would give me pause as well, because when I think ziplines I think of something high off the ground, but as I'm writing this I just remembered that my neighbor had a zip line growing up, and it was all of six feet in the air at the highest point, so zip lines aren't necessarily dangerous.

It seems like this boils down to two issues: your child being exposed to an atypical lifestyle, and your son's safety. \n\nIssue 1: Polyamory is a unique lifestyle, and it's normal to be apprehensive of it. However, whether it's for you or not it exists in the world, and works for some people. Your son will grow up knowing about this, and his lifestyle will eventually be his decision. The best thing you can do IMO is to try and expose him to loving families of all kinds, showing him examples of lifestyles that exist and make people happy and to let him forge his own path. You can heavily sway his decision by maintaining a happy two parent household for him to grow up in. \n\nIssue 2: I totally understand your desire to keep your son safe. While many of the things you mentioned can be very fun for a child his age, they can also be very dangerous without proper supervision. My advice here would be to go with your son on one of these playdates! This would allow you to make sure your son is being safe, while still letting him have fun. Additionally you'd have an opportunity to talk to these people and maybe learn a perspective you didn't have before. Then, if you think these people would have a bad influence on your son, you can make an informed decision. This would set a good example for your son - to try things before deciding you don't like them!\n\nTL;DR Set up the playdate and go with your son. That way you can set a good example for him by trying something before deciding it's bad (and avoid being the bad guy outright in his eyes). Also maybe bring a bike helmet for him.\n\nEdit: Forgot to add NAH.

It would probably have built resentment in me if I had the opportunity to try those things and my mom was saying no because she didn't like that the kid had two moms and a dad.   \n\n\nVisit the house together, get to know the parents while you allow your kid to play at the house, and then decide if it's okay if he continues to visit or not. You are around your kid more than any other set of parents will be, you will be the primary influence on what your son believes \"proper\" romance and homelife is. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest of luck.", "NAH. I would be happy that they are at least honest about it. A ton of people seem perfectly average in public but turns out they are not at all that way at home.

Your son will meet older kids, and bad influences throughout his life. The only thing you are protecting him from is finding out later, and being comfortable talking to you about it. \n\nAlso, if you try to make it seem these communities are doing bad things, he will figure out you are biased and wrong. Think of it as a different religion. \n\nWould you stop him from going to a friend's house if the friend was Jewish, or Muslim? At least one of those groups believe and live differently than you.

So I may get down voted for this, but it has nothing to do with the polyamorous relationships. For me, I'd be concerned with my 7 year old child being at anyone's home where there are multiple people in and out that I don't know (and not sure who lives there or coming in and out). You absolutely cannot police anyone else's home, but you can decide if you're comfortable with sending your kid.\n\n For me, 7 years old is too young to send to a school friend's home. I have a rule/agreement with my older son. I will not let him go to a friend's home until he is old enough to get himself out of an unsafe situation. Like until he has his own cell phone, or is can get to a phone/get help. My husband and I both work in fields where we have seen the worst happen to children and it is usually at the hands of someone that was trusted with the child. Family members and friends or older children/teens are usually the perpetrators. I know my kids will be exposed to different lifestyles and I'm fine with that.

Its all a huge cult, maybe not your family (which is absolutely foreign to me, cause SALT LAKE CITY), so realising my family was eXtRa is weird.\n\nLike if someone had a dirt bike I'm pretty sure you'd be shunted to some reform program like they did Josh Duggar (fundie not Mormon I know but we have those too) and yeah we had the same shit with SA and all that in our families to. It was bad where I grew up.\n\nSo I apologise to those who didn't experience this, cause I keep forgetting I was raised in the \"everyone wears matching clothes\" sect of the religion.", "Oh dear fuck this is yet another one of those times I find out my family was extra-culty.\n\nSorry I have a bad yardstick to measure this.\n\nAnd in hilarious timing I just booked tickets to go kayaking next week.", "Just to clarify, Im talking about the FLDS (multiple marriages, child brides, Utah, all that stuff), not your average Mormon.", "Yeah other comments pointed out my fam was good ol Salt Lake City extra Mormon Mormons.", "Yikes.

But none of them are protected and enabled by enormously wealthy organizations with no oversight and protection by police and local government. \n\nReligious men (or women) are probably not statistically any more predatory than any other slice of society. It's just that their predators are much, *much* more enabled and protected from consequences.", "Fair point.", "Especially if you're looking at multiple younger wives you're probably looking at fundamentalist LDS, forced child marriage type shit.", "I'll give you an upvote for that", "I think the term you're looking for is high-demand religion. As in, as soon as you're baptized you basically have a calling, a book group, dinners at people's houses to go to, etc. You can say no and keep coming, but they frown on it.

Probably for the best, but it really sucked at the time.", "And thus the cycle of bigotry continues.", "Ok but the sub isn\u2019t \u201cam I within my rights\u201d", "It's also ignorant and bigoted AF. That's the same excuse people use for not allowing their children around gay people. It doesn't rub off", "Mormons don't party, and they definitely don't allow their kids to swear. This definitely sounds more like your run-of-the-mill polyamorous couple with poor boundaries.", "Mormons who practice polygamy and Mormons who let their kids swear and go to public/secular school are two distinct and non-overlapping groups. FLDS (which is different from modern mainstream Mormonism, which condemns polygamy) tend to be fairly isolationist, homeschool their children, and dress very distinctively. OP would know if they were FLDS, even if they didn't know specifically what the sect is called.\n\nThis is much more likely the Fetlife kind of poly than the religious fundamentalist kind.", "Oh come on, you're not serious are you?  There is nothing in the definition of polygamy that says you abuse 12 year olds.  It sounds like you're changing a definition so that it fits your world view.  What you're talking about is purely about a common execution of the practice and not about the definition.\n\nThe primary difference in the actual definitions of polygamy vs. polyamory is that polygamy involves being married to multiple partners, which is illegal, and polyamory involves being in a relationship (not married) with multiple partners.  As soon as a poly amorous group decided to all get married to each other they are now committing bigamy and are polygamists. \n\nSince I likely can't just state facts without being accused of supporting something I don't, I'll just say that I definitely don't support polygamy, because it's illegal and so often it is executed in a way that is abusive.  IMO ultimately if everyone is consenting (not groomed), free to leave whenever, and healthy/happy then have whatever lawful relationship structure you want.", ">rules for thee but not for me\n\nShe literally is supportive of abortion in the cases from your previous comment, and she votes Democrat because she's not a single-issue voter and is left on other topics.

It's not 'live and let live' when one side is using the cover of 'but surely the laws will be reasonable and not monstrous' to pass monstrous legislation. There are no such things as exceptions in anti-abortion law. From scared hospital admins to religious doctors to vindictive ex-husbands suing years after the fact; anti-abortion statues mean that women's health is compromised and abortion inaccessible. If the writer doesn't understand this, she won't teach her friend. We have to use every tool we have right now, including social shame and pushback, because they are coming for every state as we speak, and birth control is already on the chopping block. Anti-trans laws are being written in such a way as to allow for harassing 'indecently dressed' women, let alone how absolutely fucked the whole premise of them is to start with. Republicans are trying to push us into a religious theocracy and white male supremacist society. Being pushy in the other direction on the internet is literally the least we can do.", "Not OP but that sounds awesome, thanks!", "Funnily it's not a vacation it's a work thing!

Why family why.\n\nBut obviously from my cursing and past tense you can see its been behind me for awhile.
