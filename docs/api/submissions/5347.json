(I'm betting she's pregnant and they planned on announcing it at your party.)", "NTA they showed you where you are on their hierarchy, you\u2019re just following suit.", "NTA. Petty though? Hell yeah. And I respect you for that lmao", "NTA - invite who you want there and don\u2019t invite who you don\u2019t want there.\n\nAfter all, you\u2019re just having a \u2018smaller\u2019 Christmas party with * *checks notes* * 200 guests, right?", "I might be in the wrong for this but this NTA. \n\nI thought this was going be a tit for tat situation, but it seems like you thought more highly of them than they think of you. Especially a \u201csmall\u201d wedding. Which they invited other friends. Which is fine, it\u2019s their wedding. But, they also gotta realize this your Christmas party and you can invite who you want.", "NTA, it\u2019s your party so you can do what you want , also they might just want an invite to your party to use as another announcement opportunity, maybe they are pregnant now and want to use your party and piggy back off of it like they did for their engagement announcement", "NTA. Normally I'd say that they can invite or not invite whoever they want to their wedding. But by that same logic, you can invite whoever you want to your party. You're upset they didn't invite you, they're upset you didn't invite them. \n\nThe difference is they're using your Christmas party as a celebration of *their relationship*. They feel entitled to your Christmas party because it's iMpOrTaNt to their relationship, but they don't view you as important. They'll keep using your party to announce life events because they feel *entitled* to your party as a celebration of them.\n\n200 people is *not* a small wedding, but if they think it is, you have 2 new friends you've invited and you just couldn't fit them in, too. So sorry, darlings, it's just a small party, you understand, right?", "NTA. I think it's pretty clear that despite being the reason they met, you weren't important enough to be invited to their wedding when 200 other guests were. So I don't see why they're entitled to an invite to your Christmas party.", "NTA what did they expect. I would of done the same thing as you.", "NTA - they chose not to invite you, you can do the same. \n\n200 isn\u2019t a small wedding - they deliberately cut you out. Why on earth do they deserve an invite to your party?", "NTA. They just wanted to get a free party for when they first met. They already got an \"engagement party\" out of you after all. They didn't owe you an invite, but the fact that they didn't even think  that it would be nice to do so is telling. They didn't even bother to talk to you in person. Have a great party with people who do actually consider you.", "Totally NTA. I am surprised at the people trying to find the reason to blame you. It\u2019s like pulling feathers on an egg. It\u2019s their responsibility, civility to be eligible to get an invite and they are not civil enough.  What ever hell the reasons are . They did not show them for announcing in her house .", "NTA. I am glad that you are keeping the same energy.", "NTA - it\u2019s your party and you can invite who you want - that being said they can invite whoever they want to the wedding.\nWhat sucks is they are trying to use mutual friends to blackmail their way back in by oh you should just invite them so we don\u2019t stab you in the back movement!  Nope sorry they suck for that, also to say are you being petty yes but I get that you, introduced them and they announce their engagement at this party, so now they have decided it\u2019s not your party it\u2019s theirs that you throw for them! At your cost!", "i\u2019m leaning against NAH and a bit of NTA, you weren\u2019t invited to their wedding, and they aren\u2019t invited to your Christmas party. seems legit", "NTA. It\u2019s your party. Invite whoever you wanna invite.", "NTA, but I would question how you would move forward with them as friends. Everyone viewed the relationship differently and now that it\u2019s in the open, you should prioritize as well. With this level of awkwardness between everyone, I can only imagine there would be drama if you were to extend an invitation after not sending one. Life\u2019s too short to spend it with people who don\u2019t appreciate you.", "&#x200B;\n\nNTA, it's YOUR party, you can invite whoever you want.\n\nAnd seriously you'd think if you INTRODUCED them, the least they'd do would be invite you to their wedding.\n\nI wouldn't be overly petty, or make a big deal out of it, or go out of your way to tell them WHY... no sense in starting drama where it doesn't need to be, but also... Your party, your rules. I'd have been peeved in your situation too.", "NTA\n\nIf your friends bring it up again, I would say something like- they don't actually want to see me though, do they. They want to come to my house because that's where they met and announced their engagement. They are upset is because they use my party, which I loving arrange for people I care about, as a nostalgic relationship moment. They don't actually care about me and my partner and what the party is actually about, which is friendship, they only care that its special for them. I am sure they wouldn't even being talking to other about the party if I had a summer garden party and didn't invited them.", "NTA - I would totally not invite them either. However, something isn\u2019t adding up. I would put it out there that you\u2019d invite then if you knew the REAL reason you weren\u2019t invited to their wedding. Then, make a decision on if they should be there or not.", "**NTA**. Are you being petty? Yes. Are you entitled to be petty about who you invite to your parties? Also yes.\n\nProbably you're torpedoing this friendship permanently, and it may damage your other relationships as collateral as it's going to be obvious to people why you're acting like this, but I think not inviting them is understandable after they basically spurned you in the first place.", "They at least, like, told you ''im sorry for not inviting you for xyz reasons''? Or they straight up didn't invite and life goes on? because for them to have the audacity to still be mad about it, they at least have to have made you a nice apology, i mean, they literally met because of you and announced their engagement at your party apart from the friendship they had with you previously, the right thing was for them to see it coming and just pretend that this year there wasn't a christmas party lol  \nNTA btw", "NAH. You're both allowed to invite, or not invite, whoever you want to your celebrations.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Honestly it kind of sounds like they are upset because they wanted to use you and your dime to announce something (like a pregnancy) or just take over the party gushing to everyone about how they met at this same place \"they just knew they were meant for each other\" or something gag worthy cringy. $10 says they would have left you out of their gushing too. If my hubby and I ever got officially married the friend we met through would be one of the VIPs on the list because who knows if we would have met without our friend. They didn't see fit to include you, they can find another party to take over lol.", "NTA", "NTA, I may be wrong, but it just seems that they're more upset about not being invited to an event they now consider their 'own special day' instead of how they feel about you as 'their friend' doing that to them.", "You did nake a stink over it, that's what you are doing now. \n\nInfo: have you seen them since the wedding?", "Nta.

That should have been you btw. Instead of, \"Well, I'm going to uninvite you right back!\" as a reaction, when they'd been back from their honeymoon a month more, it should have been, \"Hey, we didn't get an invite; did we offend you? We really treasure your friendship and feel like we did something wrong.\" You're past that point, and now that they're missing out on something, they're being just as petty as you were. Everyone's behaving like entitled, passive-aggressive children here. Their wedding is their business, and your house parties are yours. Supportive friends respect each other's boundaries and engage in honest communication.", "I'm gonna go with a soft YTA for both sides. While both sides are allowed to invite whomever they want, both sides should have invited the other. Especially when you introduced them at your party. That said, your friends are technically correct. Your only reason for not inviting them was because they didn't invite you, which is in fact being petty.", "NAH - You have the right to invite or not invite whoever you want to your party for whatever reason (or no reason at all).

I don\u2018t find that petty.", "Not petty, letting go of friendships that are no longer valued isn't petty, it's healthy. Nothing I read makes it sound like it was a revenge uninvite.

It started out small when we were younger and now it's this big thing. I just don't like being taken for granted.", "The fact that they didn't even bother to apologize to you, shows to me that you were in a friendship where you valued them more than they value you, if i was you i would just stick with it and don't invite then,  and I would leave someone at the entrance because seeing their attitude I wouldn't doubt them trying to go without invitations, like being someone +1", "I mean, that kind of makes YTA though, right? They might have had a valid reason, but as it stands, you have no idea. Don't get me wrong! I get it. But, you probably should've verified facts with them first.", "200 is not small.", "ok", "Thank you for point that out.  I missed that.  I'm changing my vote.", "That sounds awesome! I'll be your friend. :D", "Yeah this is all making a lot more sense now. You go out of your way every year to throw this huge party for everyone and now they're upset they're the only ones that are missing out.\n\nNot like they cared when all of your friends went to their wedding and YOU were the only ones missing out.\n\nScrew these people, you don't owe them anything.", "If I value someone's friendship and am getting married I'd at least talk to them about why I couldn't invite them.", "If they wanted them there but couldn\u2019t have them they would\u2019ve said so. They said nothing for like 6 months, so\u2026"]}
