Especially a \u201csmall\u201d wedding. Which they invited other friends. Which is fine, it\u2019s their wedding. But, they also gotta realize this your Christmas party and you can invite who you want.", "NTA, it\u2019s your party so you can do what you want , also they might just want an invite to your party to use as another announcement opportunity, maybe they are pregnant now and want to use your party and piggy back off of it like they did for their engagement announcement", "NTA. Normally I'd say that they can invite or not invite whoever they want to their wedding. But by that same logic, you can invite whoever you want to your party. You're upset they didn't invite you, they're upset you didn't invite them. \n\nThe difference is they're using your Christmas party as a celebration of *their relationship*. They feel entitled to your Christmas party because it's iMpOrTaNt to their relationship, but they don't view you as important. They'll keep using your party to announce life events because they feel *entitled* to your party as a celebration of them.\n\n200 people is *not* a small wedding, but if they think it is, you have 2 new friends you've invited and you just couldn't fit them in, too. So sorry, darlings, it's just a small party, you understand, right?", "NTA. I think it's pretty clear that despite being the reason they met, you weren't important enough to be invited to their wedding when 200 other guests were. So I don't see why they're entitled to an invite to your Christmas party.", "NTA what did they expect. I would of done the same thing as you.", "NTA - they chose not to invite you, you can do the same. \n\n200 isn\u2019t a small wedding - they deliberately cut you out. Why on earth do they deserve an invite to your party?", "NTA. They just wanted to get a free party for when they first met. They already got an \"engagement party\" out of you after all. They didn't owe you an invite, but the fact that they didn't even think  that it would be nice to do so is telling. They didn't even bother to talk to you in person. Have a great party with people who do actually consider you.", "Totally NTA. I am surprised at the people trying to find the reason to blame you. It\u2019s like pulling feathers on an egg. It\u2019s their responsibility, civility to be eligible to get an invite and they are not civil enough.  What ever hell the reasons are . They did not show them for announcing in her house .", "NTA. I am glad that you are keeping the same energy.", "NTA - it\u2019s your party and you can invite who you want - that being said they can invite whoever they want to the wedding.\nWhat sucks is they are trying to use mutual friends to blackmail their way back in by oh you should just invite them so we don\u2019t stab you in the back movement!  Nope sorry they suck for that, also to say are you being petty yes but I get that you, introduced them and they announce their engagement at this party, so now they have decided it\u2019s not your party it\u2019s theirs that you throw for them! At your cost!", "i\u2019m leaning against NAH and a bit of NTA, you weren\u2019t invited to their wedding, and they aren\u2019t invited to your Christmas party. seems legit", "NTA. It\u2019s your party. Invite whoever you wanna invite.", "NTA, but I would question how you would move forward with them as friends. Everyone viewed the relationship differently and now that it\u2019s in the open, you should prioritize as well. With this level of awkwardness between everyone, I can only imagine there would be drama if you were to extend an invitation after not sending one. Life\u2019s too short to spend it with people who don\u2019t appreciate you.", "&#x200B;\n\nNTA, it's YOUR party, you can invite whoever you want.\n\nAnd seriously you'd think if you INTRODUCED them, the least they'd do would be invite you to their wedding.\n\nI wouldn't be overly petty, or make a big deal out of it, or go out of your way to tell them WHY... no sense in starting drama where it doesn't need to be, but also... Your party, your rules. I'd have been peeved in your situation too.", "NTA\n\nIf your friends bring it up again, I would say something like- they don't actually want to see me though, do they. They want to come to my house because that's where they met and announced their engagement. They are upset is because they use my party, which I loving arrange for people I care about, as a nostalgic relationship moment. They don't actually care about me and my partner and what the party is actually about, which is friendship, they only care that its special for them. I am sure they wouldn't even being talking to other about the party if I had a summer garden party and didn't invited them.", "NTA - I would totally not invite them either. However, something isn\u2019t adding up. I would put it out there that you\u2019d invite then if you knew the REAL reason you weren\u2019t invited to their wedding. Then, make a decision on if they should be there or not.", "**NTA**. Are you being petty? Yes. Are you entitled to be petty about who you invite to your parties? Also yes.\n\nProbably you're torpedoing this friendship permanently, and it may damage your other relationships as collateral as it's going to be obvious to people why you're acting like this, but I think not inviting them is understandable after they basically spurned you in the first place.", "They at least, like, told you ''im sorry for not inviting you for xyz reasons''? Or they straight up didn't invite and life goes on? because for them to have the audacity to still be mad about it, they at least have to have made you a nice apology, i mean, they literally met because of you and announced their engagement at your party apart from the friendship they had with you previously, the right thing was for them to see it coming and just pretend that this year there wasn't a christmas party lol  \nNTA btw", "NAH.

Of course, if you actually talked about it that way, people would realise they're wrong, but it's trickier when it's subconscious.\n\nWhen they invite people to their wedding, they feel like it's their event. Of course it's still rude of them to not invite you, but it's not your right to come. But when you don't invite them, it is more like being disinvited from a community party that they have a more impersonal right to attend.\n\nThey've stopped seeing you as a friend, and started seeing you as an Organiser, and your party as some sort of common good.\n\nOf course, this is a (possible) explanation, not an excuse at all.

It should make them realise that if they keep pushing, they aren't getting an invitation next year either. And if they do keep pushing, revoke their invitation this year.

No way, they don't deserve to come. Don't just give in like your husband wants you too.", "What puzzles me is why no wedding invite. It just doesn't make sense. There has to be some kind of fairly extreme reason.\n\n- Are OP & partner a nontraditional couple in some way? Was the wedding exclusion bigotry? Or maybe the reverse - friends are a nontraditional couple & OP or spouse are known to be bigoted towards couples of that category, whatever it might be?\n\n- Is there some history of OP or partner making drunken scenes or otherwise causing drama? Or always having to be the center of attention? (Though it sounds far likelier that latter is typical of the \"friends,\" given their using OP's Xmas party for their engagement announcement.)\n\n- Are OP & partner much more sensible than the \"friends\" about COVID precautions like masking? If \"friends\" thought someone masking at their wedding would make ppl uncomfortable by reminding them there's a pandemic, they might have not invited them for that reason. Ppl who mask get both harassed and excluded a lot these days. However, the fact that OP is throwing a 200-person party & \"friends\" threw a 200- person wedding would seem to argue that they're all on the same risky page, so this explanation seems unlikely.\n\nLeaving aside that one very puzzling aspect, it sounds to me like these \"friends\" view OP's party not so much as a private party but more as an almost public event.\n\nAnd, as others have pointed out, they were likely planning on using it as \"their\" announcement party again this year.\n\nBut circling back, I'd be awfully curious to know if any of the possible wedding exclusion reasons above seem to strike any chords with OP!\n\nOh, and in any event, NTA. Even in the worst-case scenario (that OP or partner have a history of being disruptive at other ppl's events), the \"friends\" still have no good reason to expect an invitation.

With 50 people you know? Considering they met through you and announced their engagement at your house, you\u2019re not wrong for feeling snubbed. They\u2019ve shown how they feel. You handled it well, especially since you didn\u2019t make a big thing of it and let them enjoy their wedding drama free. You are allowed to invite whoever you want, just like they did with their wedding. They just want to use your house and party as a venue and make it about their anniversary.
