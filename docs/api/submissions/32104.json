It's only 20 minutes away. \n\nYou are wasting gas and pouring extra emissions into the atmosphere everyday. There's no reason to do this. It isn't good for your vehicle. This routine of yours serves no purpose and puts yourself in danger for no reason. It isn't uncommon for criminals to target people for robbery (or worse) at closing time.\n\nhttps://www.consumerreports.org/cars/cars-driving/should-you-warm-up-your-car-before-driving-a5580016349/\n\nConsumer Reports\u2019 chief mechanic, John Ibbotson, says that giving the engine a chance to run for a minute before driving on a cold day is smart but that there isn\u2019t a need to let it run longer beyond warming the cabin and\u00a0defogging the windshield. And there\u2019s a real downside: wasting fuel and generating emissions.\n\nAn engine is fully lubricated long before it reaches full operating temperature. When your car sits for an extended period of time, the oil drains down to the bottom of the oil pan. Once you start the engine, the oil pump quickly circulates the oil throughout the motor, lubricating all the necessary moving engine components. A cold engine idles at 1,200 rpm or more, making quick work of the lubrication process. Being mindful to give your engine a chance to lubricate, along with being diligent about routine maintenance, can help most modern engines last 200,000 miles or more. \n\nThere used to be a saying about older engines that the worst thing you could do for a motor was to start it, because for a split second those engines were somewhat dry and weren\u2019t well lubricated with oil.\n\nModern cars have improved in technology to the point where your engine is fully lubricated within 20 to 30 seconds. By the time you get in, start the car, put on your seat belt, and get comfortable, the engine might not be fully warm. But it\u2019s completely lubricated, and you\u2019re okay to drive at this point.\n\nWhen temperatures drop during winter, it\u2019s a good idea to let the car run for about a minute. Some drivers prefer to let the engine idle for 20 minutes or longer to get everything\u2014including the cabin\u2014really warm, but the fastest way to warm up an engine is by driving. Just remember not to rev the engine hard for the first few minutes of driving until you see the temperature gauge move off the cold reading.\n\nIn terms of comfort, when you drive the car it\u2019s going to warm up in just a few minutes vs. idling for 15 or 20 minutes. Extended idling just wastes gas.", "I work construction as a foreman and I don\u2019t leave the parking lot till my crew is gone.

I live in a semi-urban city in Michigan, one night as I was leaving my house, I saw two men walking down the street.  I waited until they had got to the corner of the block and was crossing unto the the next block.  I exited my house, got into my car, put the key into the ignition and looked into my purse to make sure I had my wallet inside.  The next thing I knew was someone was knocking on my driver side car window.  I looked up and there was one of the men knocking on my window with the butt of his gun.  He said \"Get out of the car B\\*\\*ch and leave the purse\".  I have a habit of automatically putting my keys (house and car) inside of my pocket whenever I exit my car or home.  The guy with the gun got in on the driver's side when I exited my car and the other guy got in on the rear driver's side.  The guy with the gun said \"Where's the key B\\*\\*ch\", it was then that I realize that I had automatically placed the key in my pocket when I exited the car, so I said the key was in the car.  Both men started looking inside the car which gave me the chance to run into my backyard, jump my fence and jump several other neighbor's fences and hide in the third neighbor's backyard.  It wasn't even a full minute of my looking inside of my purse for these guys to run back to my car from half a block and try to car jack me.  So you just sitting there eating a snack and/or scrolling through your phone is giving someone the chance to run up on you.
