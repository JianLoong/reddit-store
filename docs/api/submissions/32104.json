You are a grown woman and you can tell someone when you don't like something. \n\nI would warn you about your mindset. The \"trouble won't find you unless you are looking for it\" is a horrible statement. Yes, it does sound like victim blaming but if someone is going to shoot or rob you, they are going to do it. Crime doesn't care if you are organized and saying \"well it hasn't happened yet\" means nothing with something does happen. There are countless stories of victims minding their own business getting robbed or shot.", "NAH.  \n\nHe was just trying to be kind, and as you said yourself, \"I know that danger exists and that I'm a woman sitting in a parking lot...\" You said he was older\u2014maybe he is just doing what he would hope someone would do for his daughter (or son, or wife). He certainly wasn't doing anything wrong, and don't let the scolds on here try to twist this into some evil act.\n\nAnd you did nothing wrong in asking him to leave. You're an adult, and entitled to your own decisions. You're also entitled to your own risk assessment. Your co-worker gets picked up every night? I bet she feels less comfortable in the parking lot than you do, and that's probably what Ned is responding to in your case. But if you are more comfortable, you go for it.\n\nMaybe the lightest You're TA because you could have been gentler and more thankful when dismissing him; this was the first time you asked, so you probably didn't need to be harsh about it.", "NTA.

First the engine needs to warm up.", "INFO: Does he make his wife sit with him with him and wait or are they in separate cars?", "Kinda YTA, yes. As a group of coworkers, you make a point of going to your cars together for safety purposes - and then you decide to stay behind. So Ned is faced with the decision to either let you sit there alone, or wait with you. He made the choice to put your safety (remember, the thing you left work in a group for?) over his convenience. That's a good thing. Then you decided to rebuff him over it. That's not a good thing.", "NTA as it is your choice.", "I would say you're a soft YTA.  You have said the location isn't the best, you are a lone in parking lot late at night , scrolling your phone, so your focus isn't on everything else.  You have someone who is looking out for you and you're upset?  Is it because he's a man watching out for you?  Maybe he just wants to make sure his coworker is safe late at night.  So far nothing has happened, but this world is getting more crazy by the damn hour.  If it bothered you that bad, you could have been a little nicer in asking him to leave.", "YTA, you're doing something you know isn't the safest decision, and he's just watching out for you. People can call it sexist if they want, but a woman sitting alone in a dark parking lot is more likely to get attacked than a man in the same situation. He stays in his car, and it's not like he's trying to get into yours.", "NTA\n\nProtecting a woman who doesn't want to be protected is pure chauvanism.", "Asshole: I feel where you\u2019re coming from, but, I think you could have handled that a little more gracefully. I\u2019d apologize if it were me in your shoes. The amount of people getting mugged and beaten half to death by some crazy homeless dude is crazy. Lots of people would love a guy like Ned.", "Info:  You say the neighborhood is bad.  But are we talking downtown Chicago bad, or like rural Kentucky bad?\n\nEither way, you're an adult who has the right to decide how you live your life and the actions you take.

People (men & women) do this kind of stuff all the time. Look out for each other & wait for everyone to drive away. For all Ned knows you have car problems. Why didn\u2019t you just roll down your window & let Ned know he could leave? \n\nThis works out for both of you. Ned can leave, get home earlier & you can sit for as long as you want scrolling on your phone in an empty parking lot.\n\nNAH", "NTA\n\nNed is being covertly sexist. Acting like you\u2019re a damsel in distress that needs protecting, and he doesn\u2019t seem to care whether you want his help or not. Fuck Ned and his feelings over this.

Women sitting in cars in parking lots are at the most risk of abduction/harm. And you aren't just sitting for 2 minutes to fiddle with your keys, which is already more time than a jerk with a gun needs.   \nYou yourself admitted that to stay safe in that neighbourhood you need to be organized and avoid looking for trouble, but \"looking for trouble\" is *exactly what you're doing.* Don't make the mistake so many before you have, by convincing yourself the worst cannot possibly happen to *you.*  \nI really hope your 20-minute parking lot snack habit doesn't wind up with you becoming a statistic on the evening news.", "There's INFO missing here.\n\nDid you have some other problems with Ned in the past? \nWhat makes him stay and watch over you for nothing more than light care?\n\nSpit it out. You probably know this guy for 7 years aprox. I bet hard cash that this isn't the first time something out of the ordinary happened.", "INFO. So is he there on his own? Why?
