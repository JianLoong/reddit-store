Our house is for sale, and we are splitting the rent on an apartment until we find a buyer. So the girls live in the house full time and we switch off between house and apartment. It is weird, but it works. So here's the drama.\n\nMy wife and her mom used to always get into these huge fights and vow never to speak to each other again, and then a month later they are each other's rocks and love each other more than anything. When she was my wife, I would always be on her side. When mom was persona non grata, I was anti mom, when she was beloved again, I was her loyal son. They got into another fight over the weekend, and my ex texted me to say her mom can't come over anymore.\n\nSo I texted back that now that we are divorced, I'd rather not be involved in their fight. Like, let's say I do this, and a month later they make up, her mom might still resent me, and she might say stuff about me to the girls. I'd rather not offend her mother, because she might not forgive me like she will my ex. My ex said it's \"completely different\" this time and they are \"cutting contact for good\" (she always said that before too) and that we need to be a \"united front.\"\n\nI countered that we aren't a united front anymore, so please don't involve me in the fights with your mom. I'm not inviting her over for dinner, but I'm not going to stop her from seeing the girls either, because I know in a month you'll both be saying how horrible I was for doing that. She called me an asshole for not supporting her, but it's not my job to support her anymore, right?\n\nAm I breaking the divorcee code?", "created_utc": 1673396374, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/108pywk/aita_for_wanting_to_be_switzerland_in_family/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re no longer her emotional support person and you are allowed to maintain a cordial relationship with your former MIL.

Unless it's something for which MIL should be banned - like abuse of some sort or endangering the kids - then it seems reasonable for you to stay out of it.  \n\nBut I would not let MIL fight with mom and then spend a lot of time on your days with the kids to rub it in Mother's face.  You can be not fighting with MIL, but still not enabling her to up the drama with Mother.", "As long as you have kids together you\u2019re going to need to deal with her and her mother.

You're one half of a gatekeeping team who allows access to those kids, and if MIL did something so terrible that she should *rationally* be denied access to them, then you'd need to pick a side. \n\nHowever, it sounds likely that your ex-wife just wants support in holding a temporary (emotionally-charged, but ultimately unnecessary) grudge.", "NTA. \n\nWalking away from the other persons drama is often what divorce is about.
