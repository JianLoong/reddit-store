My wife was upset but shrugged it off. I told her I would speak to him but she told me not to bother. I asked if she wanted to swap but she said it was ok. \n\nMaybe an hour in my wife wanted to sleep as it had been a hectic trip and she was tired so tried to recline her chair to get comfy. The guy started pushing her chair back up to prevent it from reclining. I told her to try again and used a lot of my own strength to physically force it into the recline position (got there after a few go's). The person behind started to tap and bounce more on the back of her chair. Not much sleep was had. \n\nThe food came round and my wife put her seat up to allow the person behind to enjoy there meal comfortably. After the meal trash was thrown away she wanted to sleep again and the battle to put down the chair began once more until she was reclined.\n\nShe managed to get to sleep and had napped for maybe 20 minutes when he really started moving the back of her hair and she woke up with a fright.\n\nAt this point I turned around and tried to calmly say \"Hey, please can you stop leaning on my wife's seat as she is trying to sleep and you have woken her up\". He replied saying that she shouldn't be reclining her chair because it's rude. I responded saying that there is room for everyone to recline their chairs and that he can recline, then the person behind can too and so on. He said he wouldn't be rude to the person behind him. I said that my wife can recline is she wants to and asked him again to please stop leaning and I left it at that.\n\nIt was fine for 15 minutes and then she was woken up again with him leaning on the top of her seat with his phone this time. I turned around (and less politely) told him that he had already asked him to stop and that he had woken my wife again. I told him I would get a flight attendant if needed and he told me to \" go ahead, get someone\". I left it at that.\n\nI had to go to the bathroom and when I returned he had swapped seats with his partner and was now leaning on the back of a new person's seat who was watching a movie and not reclining. \n\nAITA or was I justified?", "created_utc": 1683212196, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/137oii9/aita_for_telling_the_guy_behind_us_to_not_lean_on/", "score": 3696, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You drew the inappropriate comparison between child labor in the 20th century with reclining a fucking seat in a plane. How red is this herring. The person you are replying to did not say that child labor is ok, but here you are making that argument that never existed.\n\nIf you don't want to contribute to \"big plane\" then don't fly? People pay for seats that recline and fly with the understanding that other seats also recline. You are not entitled to a seat beyond a non-reclining person, it's just that simple. Child laborers in the 20th century did not consent to dangerous labor practices, and the entire societal dynamic that allowed for the human rights abuse that is child labor is not comparable to a person reclining their seat in front of you. In this argument, who is the seat recliner analogous to? A factory owner? How absurd.", "First of all, it's a lot more comfortable and secondly, all the seats recline. It's not a surprise function.

This isn\u2019t a hypothetical lol. I\u2019m a frequent flyer for work.", "Well I'm glad some people have some sense. This was a clear cut case of a false comparison logical fallacy.", "It really is and my opinion is just as valid as yours. I just had someone recline so fast and far into me that my soda spilled on me and my neighbor.  It was 3 in the afternoon. It was her right, though?  The seats should be pre-reclined and left that way because of rude arses who can't consider anyone's comfort or inconvenience except their own. \n\nI hope for your sake you never get stuck in that last row with someone like you in front of them.  It truly sucks and I wouldn't wish that on almost anyone.", "The seats at the back.of the plane recline too. Everyone can and should recline", "If you\u2019re pushing against the seat, and the person complaint to the flight attendant, the flight attendant will tell you to stop pushing on the seat.

Look around and you\u2019ll see it.  Some people have a curved back with their head set further forward. Others have a straight back, with the back of their head in line with their back. \n\nAirline seats are made for the first group, with the head rest places further forward than the back support.  \n\nIf you\u2019re in the second group, the seat forces you to sit with your head pushed forward for the whole trip.  It\u2019s uncomfortable to do that without reclining a little.", "There is a large group of people who believe it is rude to recline your airline seat the 4 inches at the top that they are able to recline.

That is petty", "What was the issue? Him using the screen he is also entitled to and the wife didn\u2019t like that?

I have to consciously fight against my impulse to do this when I\u2019m on a flight or in public. She might not have even realized she was doing this, and I hope if ever I inadvertently fling my hair in someone\u2019s space they would kindly let me know so I could fix it.", "I have. Kids behind my sister on a flight back from Spain were playing a game for hours and I watched her being head bouncing on her headrest. She finally lost her cool. Not the kids' fault, not my sister's fault. Stupid airlines fault for installing touchscreen games on their screens. Leave the games for hand held devices.", "This has happened to me on a red eye. Between it and the crying baby, it was a horrible experience, but no way in heck would I ever blame the person in front for not proclaiming their intent to recline. You've gotta be ready for that or accept that you weren't.", "I'm genuinely trying to picture how a warning would work and can't see how it would be practical. The person in front is facing forward. They can't see behind them without standing up and turning around. So I see 2 options: 1. Stand up, turn around 2. Announce a warning into the air.\n\nEither seem like they'd be annoying and disruptive to everyone else around if everyone on the plane did it every time they want to recline.\n\nAm I missing some method that would be less disruptive than just slowly leaning back?", "Spoken like somebody who has never been on a long flight.

She was getting mad at him for using the screen even though he has that right", "Economy is hell, especially if you're on a long haul flight. I was behind someone who wanted to put their seat back for the entire flight. When I asked them to sit forward during the meal, you'd think I'd asked him to eject himself from his seat. As soon as he'd finished eating, his seat went back. I thought he was being a \\*\\*\\*\\* but from his point of view, he was justified. Urgh. I don't go on holidays often, but if I was rich I would definitely fly private so I could avoid this lol.", "I'd be that one weirdo sitting straight up for a whole flight. Idk if it's my posture from decades of vocal music training or my giant ass but I'm most comfortable sitting up straight. Of course, I also recognize that I am a weirdo so I would simply tolerate the person in front of me reclining. Luckily,  I have shorter than average legs for my height. \n\nAlthough the airline would probably make me buy two seats anyway for the aforementioned giant ass. I have no plans to ever get on an airplane, though. Everything about it sounds terrible.", "Similar thing happened to my daughter on our last flight.  The woman in front of her reclined her seat as far as it would go, and then kept throwing herself at the back of the seat, like that would somehow make it recline even further.  Made using the tray or enjoying a film pretty much impossible. It was a daytime flight.  6 hours of that, with a brief pause at meal time.", "Really? I've never flown longhaul without them doing it, they always walk up and down telling people to stop reclining when they are about to serve food.\n\nAirlines I have flown include Qantas, Emirates, Singapore Airlines, KLM, Royal Brunei, Malasia Airlines etc.", "It\u2019s not a bed either for people to fall asleep. Stop with these uneducated comments.", ">If you want to lay down to sleep, pay for the upgraded seats that allow you to do so without affecting other people.\n\nBut can\u2019t you just buy an extra legroom seat?

Period.", "Not going away. Its gotten worse. Now you pay for onboarding lanes. You pay more for aisle seats and the seat beside the aisle seat at concerts and events.", "Exactly, like if you\u2019re sitting in the seat normally and minding your business, the person in front reclining their seat shouldn\u2019t be a bother. And besides, airplane seats literally don\u2019t even recline that far. Just enough to tilt you back a little. Some people just were never shown consequences to their shitty actions, so they go through life not caring how their actions affect others.

That\u2019s just basic human decency.", "Most people understand, but some get pissed. Sorry, but I am not sawing off part of my femur so you can recline.\n\nClearly, the government needs to regulate seat size, because airlines won't be decent.", "nope, not at all. You just lack the logic to see it. It's called hyperbole for a reason.", "And that's completely fair. We're all suffering through economy together here. I'll recline as far as I can go (without injuring any legs of course) cause I wanna try to get as comfortable as I possibly can while sleeping. I also will not get mad if the person behind me is tapping away at the screen while I'm trying to sleep.

Several glares and then multiple stern warnings before actually doing something seems to track with British personas.", "Personally the way the seats are designed I basically have to recline the seat at least an inch in order to be at all comfortable. I guess I am short enough that the way the head rest protrudes it hits at the top of my head and forces my neck back at an awkward angle unless I sit up straight without leaning against the chair at all. Some planes have adjustable head rests now that make this much better, but I have had excruciating back pain after flights I couldn't recline on if there was a tall person behind me.\n\nMy Mom and sister are about the same height and always have the same issue.\n\nI just find it odd that people assume I'm being rude by reclining the seat when I have a need to do it to avoid being in pain.\n\nA lot of car seats are also really uncomfortable for me for this same reason. In some cars I basically have to sit straight up to avoid having my head tilted down at a 20 degree angle.\n\nAnyway, I don't often see people mention how short people can end up with back pain if they can't recline the seat in these discussions. Some people have a real physical need to recline.", "That's... not how airplane tray tables work.  They're mounted to the seat, not to the back.  When the chair reclines, they don't move.  And most airline seats recline about 10 degrees total.

They don\u2019t build the seats to recline that far back, and the \u201cgoblets\u201d they give you are small cups. Even been fine eating meals on the table with someone in front reclined.

The girl in front of me was literally in my lap almost the entire flight. I am a small person, and I could see her entire body, seat, and the seat in front of her.
