My wife was upset but shrugged it off. I told her I would speak to him but she told me not to bother. I asked if she wanted to swap but she said it was ok. \n\nMaybe an hour in my wife wanted to sleep as it had been a hectic trip and she was tired so tried to recline her chair to get comfy. The guy started pushing her chair back up to prevent it from reclining. I told her to try again and used a lot of my own strength to physically force it into the recline position (got there after a few go's). The person behind started to tap and bounce more on the back of her chair. Not much sleep was had. \n\nThe food came round and my wife put her seat up to allow the person behind to enjoy there meal comfortably. After the meal trash was thrown away she wanted to sleep again and the battle to put down the chair began once more until she was reclined.\n\nShe managed to get to sleep and had napped for maybe 20 minutes when he really started moving the back of her hair and she woke up with a fright.\n\nAt this point I turned around and tried to calmly say \"Hey, please can you stop leaning on my wife's seat as she is trying to sleep and you have woken her up\". He replied saying that she shouldn't be reclining her chair because it's rude. I responded saying that there is room for everyone to recline their chairs and that he can recline, then the person behind can too and so on. He said he wouldn't be rude to the person behind him. I said that my wife can recline is she wants to and asked him again to please stop leaning and I left it at that.\n\nIt was fine for 15 minutes and then she was woken up again with him leaning on the top of her seat with his phone this time. I turned around (and less politely) told him that he had already asked him to stop and that he had woken my wife again. I told him I would get a flight attendant if needed and he told me to \" go ahead, get someone\". I left it at that.\n\nI had to go to the bathroom and when I returned he had swapped seats with his partner and was now leaning on the back of a new person's seat who was watching a movie and not reclining. \n\nAITA or was I justified?", "created_utc": 1683212196, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/137oii9/aita_for_telling_the_guy_behind_us_to_not_lean_on/", "score": 1097, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He\u2019s just trying to be a dick to punish her for doing what the airlines clearly state is well within her rights", "How would he have touched her hair if it was on her side of the seat?", "Hence the ESH.  Neither party were blameless, both did things to annoy.  Would be interesting to see his side of the story.  If she had long hair then it might have been difficult not to touch it.  If she had short cropped hair then it's an automatic report to cabin crew."]}
