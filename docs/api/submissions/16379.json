My wife was upset but shrugged it off. I told her I would speak to him but she told me not to bother. I asked if she wanted to swap but she said it was ok. \n\nMaybe an hour in my wife wanted to sleep as it had been a hectic trip and she was tired so tried to recline her chair to get comfy. The guy started pushing her chair back up to prevent it from reclining. I told her to try again and used a lot of my own strength to physically force it into the recline position (got there after a few go's). The person behind started to tap and bounce more on the back of her chair. Not much sleep was had. \n\nThe food came round and my wife put her seat up to allow the person behind to enjoy there meal comfortably.

He replied saying that she shouldn't be reclining her chair because it's rude. I responded saying that there is room for everyone to recline their chairs and that he can recline, then the person behind can too and so on. He said he wouldn't be rude to the person behind him. I said that my wife can recline is she wants to and asked him again to please stop leaning and I left it at that.\n\nIt was fine for 15 minutes and then she was woken up again with him leaning on the top of her seat with his phone this time. I turned around (and less politely) told him that he had already asked him to stop and that he had woken my wife again. I told him I would get a flight attendant if needed and he told me to \" go ahead, get someone\". I left it at that.\n\nI had to go to the bathroom and when I returned he had swapped seats with his partner and was now leaning on the back of a new person's seat who was watching a movie and not reclining. \n\nAITA or was I justified?", "created_utc": 1683212196, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/137oii9/aita_for_telling_the_guy_behind_us_to_not_lean_on/", "score": 251, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don\u2019t get to insist that the person behind you sit still when they are using their own tray that you\u2019ve pushed into their lap.  Some people lean on their trays to nap or game, that\u2019s not wrong.\n\nBut\u2026 if he\u2019s reaching over her seat back to play with her hair - CREEPY.  Or if he\u2019s somehow not sitting in his seat straight, but turned sideways or using both hands to grab her seat directly to shake it - that\u2019s aggressive.  \n\nThe fact that the behind guy was happy to have the attendant called makes me look askance at OP.", "Was he 12 feet tall? I'm tall and airplane seats are very small but I still wouldn't be able to pull that off without the person in front of me being reclined", "No it isn\u2019t.  People can\u2019t sleep upright, and the stress on the back is too much in these long flights.  So no, it\u2019s not an AH move to recline a seat.  That\u2019s BS.  The airlines are TAH for making seating so sub-compact that this is even a topic.  If a seat reclines, using it is perfectly fine.  Period.", "He was over the top of the seat well before she reclined it though?", "No it isn\u2019t. They are intended to recline. Expect it to happen.", "My whole point is that it doesn't matter who is correct about airplane courtesy, when there was a solution that didn't involve starting a fight with a total stranger right in front of them that they chose not to use. You can be \"right\" and still an asshole.", "Absolutely disagree.  It\u2019s totally an AH move to care about only yourself and completely disregard the person behind you.", "And his arms are designed to rest on things", "Maybe you should. That's a young child that accidentally tripped.", "That\u2019s what I would assume, too, and I can promise I wasn\u2019t. I don\u2019t get THAT excited about word searches! LOL", "Fair enough, and apologises if I misread.\n\nTo be honest that should have been the first thing the OP did once there was an impasse so I can actually thing that would have been the nice thing to do, getting a knowledgeable impartial  person to sort things out.", "They had one objective which was to make as much money as possible while throwing everything else out the window.", "Airlines find it difficult enough to seat families together. You know that if the plane had a \"reclining\" and a \"no reclining\" section, that it would just cause much more bad feeling.", "Agree with all of this. He would surely be sitting purposely leaning over to achieve what OP has accused him of. And he would have had to put his hand over the seat to touch her hair... unless it was in his space. In which case it's unavoidable.", "He was looking up at his phone with his arms above his head. I had never seen someone sit like this before. It was from the beginning of the flight before takeoff so the seat definitely wasn't reclined at that point.", "I can see it being possible but it sounds ridiculously uncomfortable to do for any period of time", "\"I can do it so its not rude if I do it\" is some horrible logic.  \nEverybody reclining is overall less comfort than nobody reclining especially because the last row cant recline at all so its rude to recline.", "Disagree.  It is designed *to be able to* recline.  Under certain circumstances it\u2019s no big deal. How so many people came to view reclining as a \u201cright\u201d and can completely disregard the experience of the person behind them is shocking and disappointing.", "Tapping on the seat and leaning on it can also be expected. The fact is, even if the seat reclines it IS still kinda rude. Flights don\u2019t have much space, period.", "They did not start the fight. The guy behind them did by invading their space. I would have called the flight attendent as soon as he did not listen to my request.", "It\u2019s more entitled to think someone else shouldn\u2019t be able to use the features on their seat because the person behind them didn\u2019t take steps to ensure that they could also be comfortable on their flight. Let\u2019s be real, most people aren\u2019t really effected when the other person reclines there seat. If it\u2019s an issue for you, then it\u2019s an issue you *are aware of* and you can take steps to ensure your own comfort by paying for more legroom. I don\u2019t get how people think they\u2019re entitled to dictate how people use their own seat. Either deal with it or plan better. Ugh.", "Bad comparison unless there are armrests on top of all the seats", "They are. And they even have things designed for that. They\u2019re literally called \u201carmrests.\u201d", "Because their parent was letting them run up & down the aisles, should have clarified. And I was dead asleep. \n\nKids get restless on planes, I get it. But making everyone else miserable isn\u2019t how to handle it.\n\nEdit: did clarify. the airplane aisles aren\u2019t your kid\u2019s jungle gym.", "Right.  Just saw a comment by OP that his hands and elbows were leaning on the top of her seat/head.  That\u2019s not possible unless she was literally reclined into his lap, assuming he was sitting with his butt in his seat and he has normal, human sized arms.  None of this makes sense in reality.", "Yeah, F that.  It is NOT rude if a) the seat is sold as a reclining seat, b) it is a benefit of overnight/long haul travel.  That YOU are choosing to call it \u2018rude\u2019 is some messed up logic, as if you are entitled to tell other people what they can and cannot do with a product/service sold to them.  That\u2019s BS.  Take your problem up with the airlines, not the passengers who are fully within their not rude rights to recline seats that are made to recline.  Period.", "Lmfao y\u2019all are so ridiculous. The seats recline enough to offer comfort but not so much to infringe on the people behind. Y\u2019all are just whiny and expect everyone to sit rigidly because you don\u2019t want to pay to accommodate your gangly legs.", "Right if she has a right to recline, he has a right to tap on his screen and, as for moving her hair, that suggests that she had it over the seat.", "I do not expect someone to touch my hair or fight my own chair. No I don\u2019t expect people to lean on MY seat. Lean on your own seat that you paid for. You use YOUR seat. I\u2019ll use MY seat.", "I have a question for you... WIBTA if I was standing in line in a grocery store, and some asshole cut in front of me right before my turn and started unloading my groceries BUT coincidentally some other cashier opened up at the lane next to me right at that exact moment, and I chose to start arguing with the person who cut me rather than just quietly moving over to get served by the cashier who just opened? Yes, of course we can all agree cutting in line is wrong and the cutter \"started\" it, but with a perfectly acceptable solution right there (the newly opened till), it really is \"starting a fight with a stranger\" to chose to fight rather than take the easy solution that's been handed to you.\n\nI see this as a similar situation. OP's wife was trying to sleep and the person behind her was leaning on her chair and didn't want her to recline, ect ect. She had a seat available to her (OP's) which didn't have this issue that she could have switched to any time. Instead of switching, the pair of them chose to fight with a stranger. That was a choice they made, when there was an alternative solution that didn't require an argument available.", "Tray tables are meant to be used as well. It\u2019s a feature. So if I have my tray table open to use my laptop and you recline making it impossible for my laptop screen to stay open, who wins?!", "I don't know how he found it comfortable but each to their own. I'll try and describe it better. He was leaning forward and he was resting his phone on the very top of the headrest, supporting it with his hands. Kind of similar to when you might use the headrest to pull yourself up. I have never seen someone sit like this before.", "Would you be an asshole for telling someone who blatantly and rudely cut in front of you that they were rude? No, you wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m all for not starting unnecessary fights, but people who knowingly do things like that are banking on people being conflict averse and not calling out their behavior. \n\nAnd a better example would be someone cutting in line while there were others behind you, and so you go to the new checkout and let the rest of the people in line decide whether to confront the selfish person who inconvenienced them. Because this did not really solve the main issue (which was the behavior before the reclining), it just moved it to someone else.", "I use my laptop on flights all the time when someone is reclining the seat in front of me. It\u2019s not an issue. I have a huge laptop and all I have to do is pull it slightly forward. So just try that next time. I hope that tip helps!", "So his rear end was sitting in his seat as normal, seatbelt could have been on, and his arms were extended straight out in front of him and up at say  45 degree angle and the phone was in his hands? And his arms reached that far while he was in a sitting position?  And then he used his fingers to play with her hair by reaching over her seat from there?", "Clearly he was holding his phone in the Lion King being presented to the world pose", "Yes, as one does for 8 hours straight on a transatlantic flight between bouts of reaching such abnormally long arms even further down to play with the hair of the woman in front.  \n\nSince OP said in another comment that he was resting his elbows on top of the seat while it wasn\u2019t reclined, I guess this gentleman had an upper arm length of 36 inches? So total arm length per arm of 48 inches?"]}
