The main disagreement we have is about her dog, Coco. \r  \n\r  \nLisa has had Coco for six years before we met her, so needless to say they are very attached to each other. I\u2019ve never been a pet person, I\u2019ve just never had one growing up and I also migrated from a country where there are a lot of stray dogs that just coexist with us, they\u2019re not as adored or treated as part of the family as much as the Americans do. However, Coco is a small dog and Lisa loves her, so I\u2019ve also taken on a caretaker role with Coco, such as buying her food & treats, cleaning up after her, walking her, etc. \r  \n\r  \nThe main problem I have with Coco is having her on the bed every night when I sleep over at Lisa\u2019s house. Every single night she will snuggle her way into sleeping in the middle, and usually kick me off the bed by slowly edging me out, getting aggressive when I try to move her. Every single time she hears a small noise in the house she will jump off the bed using my chest as a launch pad (a few times every night) which will wake me up. Half the time I\u2019ve slept over at Lisa\u2019s, I always end up sleeping on the couch. Having sexy time with Lisa is always an issue for us because Coco will jump on the bed every chance she gets, and when we ask her to step down she just stands there and stares, which is kinda weirds me out. When we put her outside the bedroom, she will bark/wail all night until we let her back in. Imagine trying to do it with a small dog running around on the bed every few minutes and hearing her wail loudly outside the door when we kick her out, it usually kills the mood fast. Coco also tends to get very aggressive at random times when I get physically close to Lisa, so I usually have to be very careful not to make sudden movements around Coco (one time she bit me when Lisa was tickling me so I bear hugged her and tackled her to the sofa jokingly. Another time she bit me again when Lisa dropped a large box in the kitchen and I ran in from the other room to see if she was ok) Lisa is used to everything since she\u2019s had Coco for a long time. \r  \n\r  \nI am completely okay with not moving in together mainly because of Coco and I like having a place to myself where I can sleep peacefully all night, but my lady is basically getting mad I don\u2019t want to move in and insists on us getting a place together. I told her that she either let Coco live at her mother's (5 mins walk away from where our new house will be) or I wont move in with her. I genuinely can\u2019t imagine having to sleep on the couch every night in my own house or having to watch my back every time I want to hug my girlfriend if we were to move in. Lisa thinks I\u2019m being the biggest douche for saying I won\u2019t move in with Coco, but I\u2019m just mostly concerned about my sleep and since Lisa is always against disciplining Coco, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that absurd for me to not want to move in unless my condition is met. \r  \n\r  \n", "created_utc": 1703725098, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18sgol4/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_i_dont_want_to/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She treats you like the dog is her partner and you\u2019re just there. She has no intentions of training her dog. No need to move in when you won\u2019t be seen or treated as an equal.", "NAH You're discovering that you two are not compatible long-term.\n\nIt's okay that you not want to move in with a dog person, but don't ask them to get rid of the dog.  Take it as a sign you're not right for each other instead of insulting them like that.", "that dog does not seem ok.\n\nNTA", "So I\u2019m going with you would be the A if the only option was rehoming. I\u2019ll second what everyone has said about training, but wonder specifically what it would look like to kennel train her and start by kenneling her far away from the bedroom. Lol", "NAH just be prepared for the relationship to end as this sounds like it could be a deal breaker if noone wants to compromise", "NTA. Look, I\u2019m a dog person. Love them. Love the snuggles. But it sounds like although you wouldn\u2019t get a dog for yourself, you understood they were a package deal and were good with that. That\u2019s all your girlfriend can ask. It\u2019s unreasonable to ask someone to live with an animal with a history of biting. I don\u2019t care if the dog is 10 pounds or 110 pounds. Biting isn\u2019t something she should be permitting. She should be getting training for her dog. If the wrong person gets bit her dog will be reported and she could be in legal trouble. It\u2019s dangerous when a pet owner writes off such aggressive behavior because the dog is small or any other reason. \n\nThe bottom line is the dog is aggressive to you. The dog prevents you from sleeping in the same bed. The dog has a history of biting. Specifically biting you. Your girlfriend is an irresponsible pet owner is she\u2019s not addressing these issues with a qualified trainer.", "NTA it's not so much that you have a dog problem but that you have a girlfriend not understanding what you go through in the bed with the dog problem. What I do recommend is checking with her and seeing if videotaping a sleeping night over at her place is okay with both of you. Do so and show her what's going on. And you know some people think oh it's great when your toddler sleeps between the parents but when they see what happens in reality it kind of wakes you up too no wonder you're not sleeping. Since she is not receiving this treatment and it's not waking her up she's not seeing how the impact to your sleep is happening. Sometimes having it visually shown what happens can really let the other person realize how bad it is. Once that occurs then you guys come up with a plan of how to train the dog to sleep in a dog bed either outside of the bedroom or inside the bedroom whatever that you both agree with. And once that becomes a habit then talking about living together can happen.", "Nta. Coco needs training and she should step up as a responsible petowner. It's so unfair to the dog not to train properly. Imagine the anxiety.\n\nIt's also very unfair to you and she is showing a very inconsiderate side of herself here.", "You honestly don't expect she will ditch a 8+ year dog she had from a puppy for a 2 year relationship, do you?", "NAH. The dog needs help from a behaviorist. She seems reactive, protective, and generally entitled. But it's up to the owner to do something and if she doesn't want to well...hell, I'm a trainer and I don't believe in overtraining. A lot of these behaviors are easy solves, it just takes a little work. \n\nIt's totally fair to not want to live with her under those circumstances but you're not going to get your gf to remove her dog in favor of you. If my HUSBAND told me it was him or the dog I would tell him to get packing. She was here first and I'm responsible for her wellbeing.", "NTA\n\nYour gf needs to train her dog. So many people don't train their dogs, especially small dogs. My wife and I have a mini poodle, and we did obedience classes, and every day has training opportunities. \n\nA good dog trainer will use positive reinforcement, so your gf doesn't need to think that she has to be harsh on the dog. \n\nRight now, she is being an irresponsible dog owner, and a crappy gf. If her dog bites someone else, there's a good chance that it will have to be put down. Training is both for the safety of others, and the safety of the dog. \n\nIf your gf won't even try to train the dog, even to be in a crate at night in the room without freaking out, or to not bite you, I'd suggest that moving in with her is a bad idea.", "If you just said \"I don't want to move in UNLESS she rehome her dog\" then NTA.\n\nIt's not like you're making her choose between you and the dog, you're telling her that you are uncomfortable staying with her dog and would prefer your own place without a dog; the only way you agree to be in a new place if there's no dog.\n\nHaving said that generally dogs could last for 10-20 years, you sure you can wait?", "NTA, I love dogs but I would absolutely never agree to move in with someone who\u2019s dog randomly bites me, sure a small dog won\u2019t kill you, but they can still do some serious damage", "Question, what happens with the dog when your gf  ones to your house.", "NTA. That sounds terrible. I don't know how you've lasted 2 years under these circumstances.", "YTA for asking her to rehome her pet. This dog precedes you and it\u2019s unfair to ask her to rehome. She\u2019s attached and loves her pup. It\u2019s so cruel to her and the dog to rehome it. She\u2019s TA for not setting boundaries. It\u2019s important for dogs to sleep in their own bed - this is why. They disrupt sleep and it\u2019s not healthy. They\u2019re also filthy and washing them daily or even weekly can cause skin conditions. So the filthy dog shouldn\u2019t be sleeping in the bed and setting their butt where you set your face. Dogs always love to sit on pillows. Also, dogs shouldn\u2019t be in the room when you have sex. I always put the animals out for this. It\u2019s so weird because they love to just.. stare. It\u2019s weird. I love pets but they\u2019re so bizarre. She needs to set boundaries and you shouldn\u2019t make her rehome her dog. ESH but she\u2019s definitely worse and has a way too close relationship with Coco, but don\u2019t make her get rid of the dog. She\u2019ll drop you before she drops that dog", "NTA but only if your girlfriend tries (and is hopefully successful) to retrain the dog to not sleep on the bed and not be so possessive of her.\n\nRight now the dog believes it sits over you in the pecking order... which is not the right place to be.  Your girlfriend is allowing this to happen.\n\nIt's a difficult place to come back from when the dog has been allowed to do whatever it wants and now can't.\n\nBut this is a young dog that may live for another 10 years so this behaviour is not sustainable.  The other issue your girlfriend may have is if she has kids... the dog won't like that either... so re training now is better than leaving it because then the only option will be rehoming before someone could be very badly injured (which could have an outcome worse than rehoming).\n\nI wouldn't be moving in but this is not just a matter of saying rehome the dog or else.  There are some steps before that that your girlfriend could try.  How that goes depends on what you then do or say.", "NAH but be prepared for the relationship potentially not surviving this issue. Coco has been in her life longer than you have.", "Coco needs training, and Lisa needs to step up and commit to training her for her own good. Why not suggest a dog trainer or behaviourist? You\u2019re jumping straight to \u201cit\u2019s me or the dog\u201d and the dog is family so she\u2019s going to resent you for making her choose.", "NTA. You have a gf problem not a dog problem. She refuses to train her dog, despite it biting. She prioritises the dog's comfort over yours. Personally, the first time the dog woke me up/behaved badly I'd let my partner know they need to discipline their dog to ensure it respects my place in the hierarchy (dogs have a hierarchy). If she's not willing to do that I'd leave the house. If I'm not above a dog, I'm out. I would leave every time the dog made me uncomfortable and she refused to sort it out. Do not move in. It's bizarre she can't see how disrespectful this is. It's bizarre she thinks it's OK for you to go without sleep or be threatened or bitten.", "NTA\n\nYou need you rest and it's very important. You are not pet person and it's totally ok - not all ppl like pets and it's teir own business. So move in with a person with opposite view of comfort is insane.", "NTA\n\nNot really. You have a valid reason. But did you talk about it earlier, before raising the topi\u0107 about moving in together? Did you consider going to a dog behaviorist for advice?", "NTA. Crate the dog at night", "If you give up your home to move in with her and that yelping banshee of a dog, you will never have any peace until the dog dies.\n\nIf your girlfriend can\u2019t understand that, well, you know the next steps. She\u2019s being incredibly selfish in expecting you to put up with that.\n\nNTA", "NTA\nYou\u2019re willing to live separately so Coco doesn\u2019t have to be re-homed. Being able to sleep at night is important.", "Buddy. If someone has a pet before meeting you, never ask them to rehome said pet. Even if you are justified, 99% of the time you will get dumped", "NTA", "NTA. I was so ready to be against you. But you\u2019re being completely reasonable. You\u2019re happy with the way things are. You\u2019d be unhappy with the changes proposed.  Your girlfriend can live with you or with her dog but not both. Totally fair.", "NTA\n\n\nYou can't move in with an agreement for training either.  GF hasn't trained the dog in 6 years and probably won't/can't now but you'll be locked in to the lease and/or having to deal with moving and expenses to get out of the situation.", "NTA. That dog needs training and a dog owner who knows how to be one. \n\nI love dogs and have had many over the years, but you are totally right to not want to move in with Lisa. Your sleep and well-being are important and your girlfriend needs to respect that or she really doesn't deserve to be a girlfriend. \n\nI'm going to reserve judgement on Lisa depending on whether she's open to training Coco or not.", "Everything that you dont like about coco is 100% trainable.\n\nYes, you would be T A if you said Coco needs to go. Suggest training instead. Tell your gf cocos behavior makes you uncomfortable, and that is why you don't want to move in. \n\nIf coco got training and got those behaviors corrected (not snapping at you, not launching off your chest, sleeping on the floor or getting off the bed when told, barking/wailing when not in the room or locked up) then there would be no issue with moving in, right? These behaviors are happening, so her method of training is not working. Time for her to try a new approach.\n\nIf, after a reasonable time that you both agree on, coco is not better...then you need to decide next steps.", "YTA\n\nIf you think this behaviour is bad, you would not like cats. If it\u2019s this much of an issue, don\u2019t date a person with pets. Same way you don\u2019t date single parents if you don\u2019t like or care for kids.\n\nIf you\u2019re determined to make this relationship work, asking a dog trainer for their professional opinion is the first thing you should do. And maybe look into couples counselling if that doesn\u2019t help solve the problem.", "YTA - For jumping right to rehoming. \n\nBy all means address those issues, and they are issues, but you dont just get rid of a dog so quickly. Had you mentioned Lisa refusing to train the dog Id call her an AH but it doesn\u2019t sound like youve even had that conversation", "NTA. I was ready to go with YTA, but the dog is unfriendly, bite you for no reason and stop you from sleeping, so it is a problem.", "NTA\n\nWhat happens if her dog bites someone who doesn't love Lisa enough to just let it go? Lisa is being a bad pet owner.", "NTA.\n\nYour own home must be a peaceful place for you. No relationship is worth that. See about getting some training for the dog, dogs are more malleable than you might think, you just need some discipline.", "NAH\n\nGF is a dog person, and you don't like dogs. You're both free to feel the way you do\n\nYou should both face the reality though that this is a dealbreaker for you both, and your relationship isn't going to progress further. Either make peace with this, or move on", "I think you need to let Lisa and Coco-nut live happily ever after, on their own. You cant teach an old dog new tricks.\n\nNTA", "NTA, it\u2019s ok for you to set boundaries and limits on the relationship. If this dog is one of those then that is totally ok.", "You and Lisa are incompatible.  NAH", "Honestly nta, but it sounds like it\u2019s better to break up then move in because she will 100% go back on her word and bring the dog in once everything is settled and she thinks you won\u2019t pull the trigger of breaking up because it will be too much hassle", "ESH I would never relocate my dog for anyone. But my dog is trained and if a new problem arises I call in her dog trainer to adress the issue. And that's where your GF sucks. Her dog is obviously very untrained and that should change immediately. She should call in a dog trainer and work on those issues. A dog shout NOT bite anybody, should not wail when left in the other room and should be trained to sleep elswhere than your bed. Instead of demanding that your GF should relocate the dog you should demand that the dog is properly trained before you move in.", "You\u2019re NTA for asking. \n\nBut she would be an asshole for doing it. Pets aren\u2019t like toasters. You don\u2019t just give them away when they become less convenient.", "Thanks for reminding me to socialize my puppy so this doesn't happen to me. \n\nAmericans are weird about dogs, we regard them as family members. There's no way she's getting rid of that dog, if she does that's just the countdown to slowly and bitterly ending your relationship with resentment. \n\nNTA, but date a cat person next time. You are going to have a problem with about half of American dog owners. Like, have fun if you meet a gal with a pittie she can't control but says is the sweetest little baby eater ever.", "ESH never demand someone regime their pet! But your gf is an arsehole to, it's her responsibility to train her dog! Not teaching your dog appropriate behaviour is a form of neglect!

You are not *forcing* her to rehome the dog or to move in with you. \n\nShe is unwilling to train her dog at all. My dog was six too when I met my now-husband and she slept in bed with me every night. When we moved in together, she started sleeping in her own bed on the floor next to me.", "NTA. You have made your wishes clear and honestly showing her this post would be a great example of why you don't want to move in. Or get a giant dog that bites her, humps her, breaks things, and uses Coco as a toy, then ask her if you think you should train your dog? If she says yes then you stare at her, for as long as it takes for her to get the point. Animals need training, they are animals, and while this thing may love her it doesn't seem to like you, so unless she doesn't love you it's on her to do something to fix this. She just doesn't seem to understand this is genuinely affecting you so much, so help her understand.", "NAH. But there's several other pisdivke solutions like each having your own bedroom and coco not being allowed in yours, for eg.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t want to live in the situation you described either. Your girlfriend needs to train her dog properly or have it live with her mom.", "Get a dog trainer involved.

She loves her dog, you have issues with the dog.", "NAH - It sounds like Coco needs training, but I'm reluctant to call GF an AH over that.\n\nThat said: there's basically zero chance that anyone who has had a pet for *six years* is getting rid of it for someone who has been in their life for less time than the pet has.

Small dogs easily live to be 15-18 years old, Coco has half her life ahead of her still.", "If Lisa is unwilling to train Coco to at least stay out of the bedroom, I would not move in either.

You\u2019re not asking her to send the dog to the pound. It would be 5 mins away with her mom!!", "I mean, if the dog wakes you up at night and bites, that is a reasonable reason to hold off on moving in together. At first I thought, just don't let the dog in the bedroom anymore, she'll whine and bark the first few nights but if you hold firm she'll learn. And then you explained Lisa is against disciplining the dog, which leads me to suspect she won't hold firm when the dog starts messing with her sleep too. \n\nYou also look after the dog by getting the food, taking her on walks, etcetera. So it isn't like you are making a rigid ultimatum. The situation just doesn't allow you proper sleep at night and requires you to be on your guard in case the dog thinks she needs to save her human or gets jealous. It's understandable you'd rather not live with that and at the moment you both have your own place and it works. It doesn't have to change right now, you sound like you're fine with the way things are.\n\nNTA", "Asking someone to rehome their pet is instant red flag.  \n\nThere are so many other steps", "I did not make it past the second. Paragraph yes you are the asshole. She had her dogs for six years and you have been around less than her fuck off you are the asshole fuck off.", "Nta. The dog bites will only get worse and imagine life with no quality sleep.", "NTA. Lisa needs to be a better dog owner. She hasn\u2019t properly her dog and now it\u2019s affecting other aspects of life. Not ok.", "NAH\n\n  \nBut your relationship will be over soon.", "Dog trainer! Asap, if you intend on making the relationship work \n\nMy sisters friend is a well known dog trainer and these are all things that can be fixed, but it\u2019s going to largely be on your gf\n\nNot that you won\u2019t be a part of it, but you don\u2019t live together yet \n\nHow well the dog does over the next 6 months is going to be a huge indicator of whether the relationship will work", "NTA. That is one dangerous dog.", "NTA", "Yes, Coco is resource guarding your girlfriend and definitely needs training. I would talk to Lisa and recommend getting a trainer that can help resolve these issues so you can move in together happily. One of my pups has his own dog bed at the corner of my bed to sleep in so he doesn\u2019t disturb me, mainly because I have insomnia. Not sure what to suggest for the other but definitely time to get a trainer involved. Rehoming the dog, even with family, I\u2019m afraid will be too upsetting to your girlfriend.", "It sounds like Lisa could use some training as well. Techniques to identify this behavior and nip it in the bud early in the future.", "I love dogs and all other animals but I completely agree with every word of this.\n\nCoco needs training with a professional to address her resource guarding and aggression, that's not acceptable behaviour in a dog of any size. \n\nYou also need to be able to sleep properly, decent sleep is massively important for both physical and mental health and having your sleep constantly disrupted will take its toll on you really quickly.", "Every single fucking letter of this", "Yeah, I find myself saying NTA for the same reasons here.  I was ready ro judge from the title and come in here all like \"Dogs are family!  You don't just get rid of a dog, especially of 6 years!\" And so on forth.\n\nBut I think OP can see that.  The expectation is a realistic one.  He's fine not moving in at all together and that's basically what would be on the table with me were I in this situation.  I've had my dog for 15 years now.  She's an old girl.  Luckily my GF is also a big animal person.  But if she weren't and I was going to have grief over my pup, we simply wouldn't be living together.  I wouldn't get rid of my dog, I wouldn't expect anyone else to give up theirs either.  But that doesn't mean you have to live together and just cave, either.  Especially if that dog is biting and showing signs of aggression.  Absolutely not, then.  Having seperate living arrangements is indeed the solution here.", "Definitely trainable, but not easily at 6 years old. This really should have been sorted when the dog was a pup", "Please listen to this, OP! Rehoming the dog is a very last resort. The behaviors aren\u2019t acceptable but they are trainable.", "And honestly? If you're doing it, ignore the dog. Pop on some loud music and try to see if you or the dog can be louder (I just hope you aren't in an apartment)", "Sounds like the GF needs to take the initiative in training the dog, but won't because she doesn't care about OP's feelings.", "Yeah, agreed.", "GF is a *shitty* dog person.  \n\nThere is a world of difference between not liking dogs, and not liking being bitten by a dog, and hand-waving the biting as a non-issue is bullshit on her part.\n\nNTA.", "Underated comment", "Lots of countries love their dogs, its not an ameircan thing. I react accordingly to the dopamine my dogs release in my brain. I don't think loving animals that make you feel happy is werid.  Love and affection translates across all living beings.", "In England if a dog bites it has to be put down. This dog needs training and anyone who comes into the home is at massive risk of being attacked. I don\u2019t care if your dogs tiny or massive TRAIN YOUR DAMN DOG. I have a pug and he\u2019s been attacked more by little dogs than big dogs. Dogs should not be biting someone for bear hugging another person. He can use any ultimatum he wants because for SIX YEARS she\u2019s refused to train her dog. Little dogs can mail kids faces off too you know! I love my pug but if someone with an aggressive and dangerous dog wanted me to move in I\u2019d fully say it\u2019s me or the dog. SIX whole years and not been trained at all?! That\u2019s not good pet ownership at all.", "I'm not reluctant. GF is an AH for not training her damn dog.", "If you don't care your dig bites, you're an AH.", "\ud83c\udfb6 Haven\u2019t you people ever heard of closing the damn door \ud83c\udfb6", "My god", "But OP is not the one initiating the moving in together. OP states he is perfectly content with not moving in together. It is OP's girlfriend who insists on OP moving in with her, and when confronted with several issues as to why it is not possible for him, is then mad at him instead of training her dog or addressing the issue.\n\nI don't see why OP is TA here.", "\u2018Old dogs can\u2019t learn new tricks\u2019 is simply not true. They\u2019ll be ok!", "I've lived in multiple countries across four continents. I'm not saying Americans are the only people in the world who love dogs. Turkish people are famous for being lovely to animals. What I'm saying is Americans can be weirdly extreme about it, as they can be about all things.", "It doesn't have to be put down. It's up to the discretion of the person who was bit to report the animal. I have been bitten by Chihuahuas and Chihuahua/medium sized dog dybrids. I have been accidently bitten by large bully breeds during play, and I have been bitten by a GSD for not knowing boundaries. I have been through it, from ankle biters to large teeth big Bois, most dog bites do not need reporting. A bite and a maulling are completely different things. A bite is a quick thing that leaves only puncture wounds. Usually a warning, or sometimes an accident. I would feel terrible if a dog got put down for a bite.... context and nuance are missed.. most dogs, like small ankle biters, need constant supervision and in-depth training to remove their fear based aggression. Or their compensating dominant behaviours.", "And basically not taking any action even though her dog bit her boyfriend TWICE. Thats so effed up!", "Yes I get the quote!\n\nBut the OP said the dog wails outside the door till it is allowed in!  So this won't quite work.", "\ud83d\ude02", "There's nothing extreme about love, dude. As an English gal to whoever you are, love who loves you, and the love will grow. My dog has a lot of great qualities that are hard to find in people. He's not easily replacable by humans. People are not as wholesome \ud83d\ude42", "It was a joke. But also if the dog had been trained from day one that it doesn\u2019t sleep in the bed this wouldn\u2019t be a problem by the time OP came around.", "I also generally like animals better than people."]}
