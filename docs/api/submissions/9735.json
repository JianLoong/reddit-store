Sure, if the function is for attention, then planned ignoring could be *part* of the solution (there should also be replacement behaviors - how to seek attention in more appropriate ways- being taught). But if the behavior is due to trying to escape/avoid something, due to a sensory issue, or due to trying to gain access to something, the appropriate response would be different.", "Y\u2019all in this thread sound nuts. I keep seeing this sentiment, having tantrums is totally normal for a 3 year old, so you aren\u2019t even supposed to bring your child around family? Y\u2019all act like people with kids should be locked away from society and only allowed to dare interact when the kid is at least 10. If your family can\u2019t handle being around a loud toddler, or heaven forbid actually helping rather than judging, your family sucks. \n\nOh and in the OP it sounds like the OP was the only one who actually had a problem.", "Usually a big tantrum is only going to last five minutes. I think it's pretty important to note that the OP was the only person really bothered by it because no one else really made a stink about it or said anything. They also said that they are now being treated like they are the AH. Probably because the tantrum wasn't very big or long lasting, and they are now getting responses from their family that reflects an overreaction on the OP'S part.", "Children are people too - they are dealing with their feelings the only way they know how. How would you feel if, in the middle of dinner you received terrible news (e.g. a death) and began crying/sobbing and you were treated with disdain and made to leave because you were \u201cdisturbing the guests\u201d. Children tantrumming are really going through that intense level of emotion, just over something that seems \u201csmaller\u201d to adults. It\u2019s absolutely okay for everyone in a room to be having and expressing their feelings, and if you really can\u2019t handle that, you should step out.", "Yeah, I\u2019m not sure why that seems to be out of the question for most of the comments. Like, you don\u2019t even have to go home and just not have a night out, just take the screaming elsewhere until the child calms down.", "Sometimes there has to be some give and take and it\u2019s beyond rude to subject others to the ear piercing screams that come with tantrums.  My oldest used to throw tantrums like this and you can absolutely move them to another room without giving them a lot of attention.", "Yes!! \n\nI did edit my comment to clarify that when we didn't remove the kids from the table, we are all home.

But strictly speaking the behavior will discontinue sooner (in  calendar time) if you ignore it entirely. And partial reinforcement makes it more resistant to being extinguished. They should also (when he is calm and open) be teaching him what to say when he\u2019s tired, or needs help, etc.  Thus, if the behavior is on a downward trend, providing attention could make it get worse in near future (a set back).", "They went to a dinner party...with a 3 year old. They should expect that a three-year-old would behave in a developmentally appropriate way.

They could have taken him to another room yes but a baby isn't being \"a brat\" when it cries. What's your alternative? Threatening/spanking your child into submission? This goes pretty much against all evidence-based research there is on child/emotional development and oh yea, CHILD ABUSE.", "They are family.

I was surprised to see a behavioural therapist agree that ignoring is the best approach to tantrums.", "Yes, because removing a child from a situation until they are no longer screaming is definitely the same thing as locking them away forever. Get real, please. Did you hurt yourself doing those mental gymnastics?", "If adults begin screaming and throwing things in a public space, they are asked to leave or physically removed if they refuse (sometimes even by police). Children are people, and people don\u2019t have the right to continuously scream while everyone else is just trying to have a nice time out. Children are developing humans who rely on their parents to aid them in this development, which includes teaching them how to behave in various situations and how to deal with their feelings. There is absolutely nothing wrong with removing a child from a situation until they calm down. I couldn\u2019t imagine being so entitled that I would think it\u2019s appropriate for everyone else to deal with my screaming child.

She learned it did not get her the desired results and never did it again.", "I learned from being around a couple different cultures that 3 year olds are perfectly capable of doing things like be nice through a dinner.  Thankfully I learned that before I became a parent.  Kids really do rise to expectations.  Parents who expect hellions get hellions because they just shrug, declare is normal and unfixable, and don't deal with the situation, exactly like the parents in the story.", "Because \"children should be seen and not heard.\" I can't tell you how many times I have heard that growing up. It's fucking stupid. That's why. We have multiple generations of people who have internalized that.", "Some parents don't care or don't have an issue with it because \"kids need discipline\" and \"I turned out fine!\"", "Crying is one thing... throwing things on the floor is being a brat.  Also, a 3 year old is not a baby nor did I say anything about threatening or spanking.  Learn to read and comprehend.  If you are subjecting everyone else to your child's temper tantrum without attempting to calm the child down then you are a bad and/or lazy parent.  At that point, yes, the child is ruling the roost and controlling the environment of everyone there.   And we wonder why children keep acting more and more entitled.  How about actually parenting and teaching kids appropriate behavior at all stages of development instead of sticking their butts in front of a tv and ignoring bad behavior.  Parents can do whatever they want in their own homes but when in public/large gatherings they should be cognizant of how their kids behavior affects everyone else.  Taking a child to calm down in another room is not a lot to ask.", "A three year old is not a baby. It is a toddler who is developmentally able to understand that throwing a tantrum is not proper. Why are you going straight from throwing a tantrum to stopping it by spanking? There are other options, you understand that, right? (And btw, a simple spanking-a swat or two on the behind-is NOT child abuse)", "What does being family have anything to do with it?  Just because you're family you're required to listen/watch someone being a shit?  I don't think so.  Kids are not the end all be all in this world nor should everything revolve around them.", "No, parents can and should control their kids.", "I\u2019ve been in plenty of situations where other people have to listen to a tantruming child. And there was no effort to speak to the child, take them outside etc.", "Also, this may be a more personal approach, but planned ignoring doesn\u2019t have to (and depending on the circumstances, shouldn\u2019t) involve ignoring the person completely. A better way to phrase it would be not reacting to the behavior of concern. A three year old should still be supervised for safety as well, so full on ignoring is going to be inappropriate most of the time.", "If they are in the US, then that is not the correct title (not sure about elsewhere in the world). An RBT is registered behavior technician. The qualification requires 40 hours of specific coursework, a competency assessment by a BCBA, and then passing a written exam. They usually have good basic knowledge to implement behavior change programs, but not to develop the programs and choose the interventions themselves - that is a BCBA\u2019s job, which requires a master\u2019s degree, a couple thousand hours of supervised fieldwork, and passing an exam.", "Except it isn't poor parenting. It doesn't teach them that they are right. They are 3 and can't articulate why they are mad and have no better way of expressing it. So it's better to just go ahead and let them feel what they are feeling until it passes. Anger, fear, sadness, etc are all temporary. They are emotions that can't stick around. Little ones expend a lot of energy when they have tantrums. Sometimes they do it simply because they are sleepy and are fighting the urge to sleep because things are happening around them and they are overstimulated. The only thing that maybe they should have done differently is take the kid to another place and let them go nuts there instead. But it would still be loud and annoying. When they get to be a little older you can talk the situation through, but at 3 they're not going to understand. I think it is important to point out that the OP was alone with their reaction. That's because everyone else in the room either didn't get as upset about it, or they also knew to simply ignore it. Which is a completely appropriate response.", "Let me see if I follow...\n\nThe professional on behavior has weighed in, and they have offered a position that you don't agree with.  So instead of saying \"dang, new studies and information and trends yield generally better results, perhaps I should adjust my position\" you decide to double down and call it poor parenting?\n\nHoly Duning-Kruger, Batman.", "Lol people like you make me feel better about my own self. Get off reddit and get some real experience. You clearly need a dose of reality. The real world isn't perfect and ordered for a reason. We aren't raising future pets who have no free will or leadership skills needed. Kids are little human adults without the experience or knowledge. They can't be controlled like you seem to think. \n\nAnd they are 100% correct. Reacting to the tantrum teaches the kid what works and on who. They're little devils, if they think you'll cave to a tantrum, they will shamelessly abuse that character flaw you have shown. Raising children isn't just stomping out bad behavior. It's mostly showing through example how behave. If you freak out, they assume that is a healthy way to react to things that bother them. If they want to leave, they'll blow their top. Ignoring it teaches that patience and discipline are rewarded. It's a tough fight, and no parent gets it all right, but tell me with a straight face the worse kids you knew growing up don't come from parents who will do anything to shut their kid up. I meet plenty of adults who still think a tantrum might push me over the give in. It's not pretty.", "Haha touche\nAnd yet...a 3-year-old will act exactly the same way at both.", "Completely agree. They weren't rewarding the behaviour with a reaction. This is life with a 3 year old.", "Ignore someplace where everyone else doesn\u2019t have to hear them.\n\nMy daughter had tantrums and managed to recover when she was removed from the scene. No one had to listen to her while they were trying to enjoy their dinner.", "Honestly I think that\u2019s a valid point. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m absolutely not a parenting expert, but my limited experience is that kids don\u2019t consistently repeat behavior unless it gets them something they want in one way or another. I don\u2019t buy that the cousins usual MO is to let the kid wear themselves out. I realize I\u2019m making an assumption here, but my guess is the parents only ignored the tantrum in this environment because they wanted to enjoy the dinner, not because it\u2019s how they handle the tantrum normally. Even though I think OP was being a bit of an asshole, I do kind of get where they\u2019re coming from because tbh it would bother me too if they just ignored a disruptive behavior issue because they didn\u2019t want to deal with it at the moment. But again, I\u2019m certainly no expert, and I\u2019m inferring context we don\u2019t know for sure.", "In my experience, anyone who says that phrase most assuredly did NOT \u201cturn out fine,\u201d lol.", "Why should everything revolve around a petulant adult who can't deal with kids being kids?
