Other times they are just frustrated and don't know how else to get it out of their system. If the outburst is that bad take the kid oitside. It's a child. Mind your business next time, you sound exhausting to be around.", "The irony is he responded by laughing. Now the kid could thunk the tantrums are funny to other people.", "Right? Even negative attention is still attention.", ">Best way to deal with temper tantrums is to ignore them.\n\nNot when that tantrum is negatively affecting everyone else. We're not all the parent to your child.", "You're completely wrong but go off LOL", "Obviously not", "Please come down from your high place and listen. Being a parent does does not mean yours gets to scream and throw things and disrupt a group dinner. You should know this. \n\nAlso, not having kids doesn't mean one can't be offended by unchecked tantrums at dinner, in a theater, the grocery store, etc.", "How long did it last? You seemed like the only one bothered by this kid. So was it only a minute or maybe it was bratty behavior spread out in segments? Some people wait and base their reaction to tantrum off how long or big the tantrum is", "Yep, they are called \u201cthreenagers\u201d for a reason!", "Hopefully most of the people in these comments aren't parents if they think it's fine to let a 3 year old have a tantrum while they do nothing.", "Ignoring the tantrum is literally the advice that's given. What are these \"far better ways\" that even the doctors don't know about?", ">Regardless whether or not they're terrible parents, you can't say that to people.\n\nWhy not?", "Yeah no one should EVER face the consequences of their actions (in this case poor parenting) because it might hurt their feelings! how TERRIBLE for OP to do that!", "That is true.  But as a parent, to NOT TRY is irresponsible, to a criminal level.", "I'm really done with full grown adults who don't have kids thinking that children are remote controlled. \n\nAbsolutely baffling that kids are going to act like kids.../s\n\nKids are little people who have no idea how to regulate their emotions yet, and telling them to stop isn't going to do anything.", "We don't know what the tantrum was like. Maybe he just whined a threw his fork once every couple of minutes. Something that stops if you ignore it. I doubt he was laying there screaming for minutes. I normally give my kid 30 seconds to a minute to calm down before I take them away. But honestly if it was in bursts I'd probably stay and ignore, especially if its just a family dinner and they aren't that bad.", "He\u2019s only 3, still a baby. Babies cry, they scream, because they\u2019re 3", "Agreed!", "Have you never heard of the concept of someone disagreeing with you? Weird", "Tantrums are done for attention. Period. You're saying they should have tried every way they could think of to try and give him attention. Therefore teaching him tantrums are effective.", "The more you pay attention to a tantrum, the more they realize they get xyz when they do it. Sometimes you gotta let them rage a bit so they learn that it wont get any reaction and for most neurotypical kids - they learn that it\u2019s not worth it over time.", "Thank god someone has a sane answer.", "Thank you! \n\nOP is NTA", "Good point. Parents know and understand their children. Observers don\u2019t.", "Three year olds aren't babies, but they don't give fucks about advice either. My kid is 4.5 and she still won't listen on behaving better.  I am the type that will drag her into the bathroom and give her a talking to when she's misbehaving. It's honestly one of the most fustrating parts of parenting. We also don't know if this kid has sensory issues or whatever", "I think it depends on the kid. My daughter learned how to fake cough in order to get my attention. She wasn't sick, but figured out how to pretend to be sick because...more cuddles. My cousins would throw big tantrums. My aunt learned that the best thing to do was to just let them blow up, but simply not give in to their whims. She always pointed out how silly they looked by being fussy. They did eventually stop when they would be really tired afterwards with no reward. When I see kids having a tantrum, I usually ignore them. As long as they are safe and are not doing anything that is dangerous let them get it out of their system. They will get over it. Particularly stubborn kids will escalate and even feed into the situation if you don't approach them correctly. So it's sometimes better to just leave them be, and let them run out of steam.", "Like what? It is a common and acceptable technique for adults to ignore the tantrum altogether. It\u2019s called \u201cextinguishing the behavior.\u201d If you don\u2019t give the tantrum oxygen, it dies down. If you can\u2019t come up with a solution better than \u201cdo SOMETHING\u201d then shut up.", "I just think it's kinda harsh to jump to they are bad parents. Because they didn't handle the tantrum in a expected way. People aren't perfect.", "Ah so you haven\u2019t spent much time with 3 years olds?", "Yes because if you don\u2019t stop a child from behaving like a three year old when they\u2019re three, they\u2019ll just keep acting like a three year old when they\u2019re sixteen, said the nonparent.", "Yes, you are. If you were not potty trained and shit your pants, then you are a pathetic AH.", "Wow! What type of a disgusting person are you?", "We\u2019re not sure if OP parents were tho?\n\n\nEdit:typo", "I mean we don't know how long it lasts. My kid will wail for like 30 seconds and be done so why rush them out? Also sounds like a private family dinner, not like they were at Olive Garden or something.", "This was a *family dinner*, and kids are going to be kids. Go hang out at a bar if you don\u2019t want to be around children. Of course, you\u2019d have to leave yourself at home, so that could be awkward. \n\nYTA", "Yep and kid was probably bored, so any attention is going to fuel the fire.", "If this was a public restaurant I'd agree, but an in home danily dinner? No,  the best approach is to ignore the tantrum.", "As a Registered Behavioral Therapist, \nthey are actually correct. That\u2019s called negative reinforcement and will increase the problem. Any attention, (I.e. \u201cgood\u201d attention like talking it out when the child is upset or \u201cbad\u201d attention such as yelling or disciplining) will cause the behavior to increase. It\u2019s better to wait till they calm down and talk immediately after, and let them know what\u2019s right or wrong about the behavior. Sometimes, it is best to just fully ignore it (called \u201cplanned ignoring\u201d) and when the behavior is over, don\u2019t acknowledge it at all.", "I know but I gotta hear it from them lmao", "You know nothing about children.\n\nIf you give toddlers any sort of attention when they tantrum, they learn that throwing a tantrum gets them attention. To a toddler, negative attention is still miles better than no attention.\n\nThe only way to train them out of it is to ignore them completely until they\u2019ve calmed down.\n\nOlder children can be reasoned with and given consequences. Toddlers won\u2019t understand any of that and can\u2019t even effectively process language when their emotions are high. They\u2019re tiny balls of raging id, and every one of them will go through a phase where they tantrum. The ones who get through that phase the quickest are the ones whose parents just calmly ignore them until they run out of steam. Sure, if you\u2019re in a restaurant or the grocery store you should probably pick the kid up and walk out, though even that much interaction can feed a tantrum. In a family member\u2019s house? Of course you just ignore it. Literally every parenting expert will tell you this, and there\u2019s a large body of child psych research that backs it up.", "Let me clarify: you can't say that to people and expect them to remain your friends. Because \"feedback\" is always a bad idea if not given with a loving, coaching mentality.", "If they're bad parents, there's a built-in natural consequence for that: bad children and lower quality of life. Why does the OP get to dole out additional consequences?", "You do understand that at a certain point you have to giving attention to a child when they throw tantrums? It teaches them that temper tantrums do not work. So eventually they will stop trying in general. It's the same way parents are told at some point you have to stop responding when your child crying when you put to bed. You can't keep reinforcing negative behaviors.", "No, ignoring a tantrum is actually how you're supposed to handle it.", "I\u2019m not arguing, it probably literally nothing kids cry. you can\u2019t always comfort them.", "This grown ass adult couldn\u2019t even control HIS OWN emotions at the dinner table, and yet here he is judging a 3 year old. Yikes, OP. YTA.", "And when they do that you remove them from the situation until they calm down so they don\u2019t disturb everyone else\u2019s evening with an outburst\u2026.", "He's not a baby. He's a toddler. Quit romanticizing the situation.", "well the parents can ignore the tantrum but not at the cost of other people at the party! \n\nand you are rude ah af geez calm tf down", "When my little ones fussed or cried in restaurants, I\u2019d take them outside and/or walk them around until they settled and were ready to sit and eat. I also came prepared for wait times with activities. Occasionally, meals out with little ones don\u2019t work and the food has to be taken home. But with practice and clear expectations\u2014we leave if you scream\u2014kids quickly learn how to behave in public. \n\nOP sounds obnoxious, but allowing a child to wail and throw things to \u201cget it out of his system\u201d in a restaurant is definitely not appropriate parenting and ruins other diners\u2019 experiences.", "Because I don't think someone who clearly lacks the basic understanding of how a downstairs brain meltdown on a young child is not a situation to hysterically laugh at doesn't have children until they grow enough in their own empathy and understanding to handle said situation? Yes. I'm horrible.", "30 seconds is a long time tbh and i\u2019d still be annoyed whether it was at home or in a restaurant", "That's fine and dandy in your own home.

If they were at a restaurant then yes I agree fully with you. You can\u2019t necessarily control your kid but you can remove them. I would be super embarrassed to let a kid \u201cget it out of their system at a restaurant\u201d. However if we were at grandma\u2019s house or another intimate family setting then you might make the decision to ignore the tantrum if they aren\u2019t hungry, tired or need a hug.", "I am laughing at at your disgusting and cheap thinking that just because OP was blunt and called out bad parenting she doesn't deserve to be a parent? \n\nMan I hope you don't have children and if you do I am so so sorry for them! \n\nMy condolences!", "In a public setting, yes, you should take a screaming child aside so you don't disturb others.\n\nBut I would hope that at a family dinner, with *family*, that the family would be a bit more understanding.", "I think a behavioral therapist is going to be far more educated on the matter than a regular person.
