It was a lovely time and my friend was so happy that I could make it for her. \n\nI'd been invited last minute and wasn't really given a clear dress code. I naturally called my friend and asked what I should wear and she told me that she didn't really care. I made sure to press for her preferences bc I know sometimes certain clothing choices can disrespect the event or outshine the bride, all that jazz I wanted to avoid. So she told me the theme and just to fit in with those colors. So I gathered what I had: a greenish shirt with a cute animal in the center, black pants, and boots. I tucked my shirt in, wore the jewelry I had and braided my hair. I did what I could to look nice. \n\nCame to the wedding and immediately regretted my choice in clothing. I felt like an idiot with how many of my friends and the other attendants wore dresses and suits. I was embarrassed and basically ignored. While I had fun, I had gotten so many smug and dirty looks from the older folk. A lady in particular kept scowling at me everytime a picture from the photographer was taken. \n\nAlthough I was beyond upset with myself, I hid it all and focused on my friend. It was her moment, not mine. When I got the chance to hug her after the ceremony, I apologized profusely for my choice of clothing. She reassured me and said that all she really cared about was that I was able to come. The rest of the time after, I ignored the looks and just stayed in my bubble. I had tried to make small talk with some of them as to not seem awkward but they didn't make the effort back and just kinda stared at me. \n\nI loved the wedding and my friend was happy I came but I can't stop thinking that I messed up her moment by wearing these casual clothes. So AITAH?\n\n(Just a Lil note, I'm replying to some people about the kind of clothes I have, what was on the shirt, etc. I'm in no way trying to dismiss or lighten my actions.

What were you expecting at a wedding.", "Your friend was happy you came. Your judgment was poor. You don\u2019t wear clothes with animals on them to a wedding. You just don\u2019t.

It doesn\u2019t matter and it is not a reason to feel bad about yourself.\n2. Buy yourself a nice, plain dress in a nice colour - blue or green is always good and I recommend a crossover dress because they look good on everyone, can be dressed up or down and work for basically any occasion.

It'll become a funny story, eventually.   \n\n\nI showed up at my best friend's wedding in India wearing what his dad told me to wear.... \"It'll be so hot and you won't be used to it.... just wear shorts\".

She shouldn't have to spend time reassuring you on her wedding day.  It's done - and even if she thought it way wayy too casual there is no way to say that without being rude.

I've been to weddings where guests have been more casual than appropriate, but I wouldn't give them dirty looks and make them feel uncomfortable.", "OK but common sense says :idc what you wear to a wedding\" means use some common sense. as in \"i dont have a strict dress code but dont be dumb.\"", "I already am, thanks for a little understanding. It was rushed and while, at the time, I thought I did my best, I could've done better.", "Thanks for being nicer to this young lady. Looks like you and I were fortunate enough to have parents with common sense and decency who knew how social events and etiquette worked, but I'm amazed at the amount of people who either have no taste whatever or do but can't be bothered to take their children places and teach them. A school near me has a \"Young Gentlemen Club\" where men from the community volunteer and teach kids about business attire, handshakes, eye contact and appropriate behavior in job interviews, at formal events, etc. So a lot of young people really haven't been taught what \"it doesn't matter what you wear\" REALLY means or how to carry themselves at such events", "I agree with this.   I think a basic level of dressing somewhat formal is kind of expected with a wedding invite, but I don\u2019t friends wedding in any way.  I think the op looked foolish, but I\u2019m guessing it didn\u2019t really bother the bride.", "Agree, NAH, it sounds like OP did not previously have the life experience to know what might be expected and had tried to ask.
