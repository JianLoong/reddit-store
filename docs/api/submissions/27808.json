They always complain that I rarely visit or call. My reasons are like yours: they're verbally abusive and they scream at me every time I go there. So I avoid it as much as possible. I told them why, but like your father, they refuse to listen because they're convinced that they're the victims. People like my parents and your father are selfish. They are mainly concerned with what other people give them; they're entitled. But you are old enough to make up your own mind. And no child or teen, regardless of age, should have to tolerate that crap from their parents.", "Absolutely f*** nta, I'm so sorry.", "NTA.\n\nHe \"doesn't know where he went wrong with you\"?! Does he need you to paint him a picture or draw him a comic strip?

Weren't you listening?\"", "NTA\n\n It takes a lot of bravery and courage to stand and tell someone so close to you that they hurt you and how they treated you was unacceptable. Be proud of yourself for knowing your self worth and standing up for yourself. If your dad really wants a relationship with you he will think about what you said and do what he can to apologise and make things right x", "NTA dude you are in no way the asshole your father is.\nI understand if you have empathy for him feeling bad but you explained your side and he gave no farther information that you hurt him and that he is automatically deserving of your love and respect. That\u2019s not how it works. I understand and implore people to respect their parents and others in general but if given a reason for them to lose your respect, you don\u2019t owe them anything. If anything he owes you a lot an apology and him taking accountability for one thing definitely needs to happen for a healthy relationship. But again if you don\u2019t want a relationship at all with him that\u2019s your prerogative. Also from someone who\u2019s been through some issues with there father themselves it\u2019s ok to still love him and not want to be around him or to just hate him for it.\n Never let anyone say shit to you about how you look or how much you weigh your amazing and honestly very smart for going about this in such a mature way.", "What a nasty asshole. Even if he did the decent thing and apologise to you and say that he would try better it wouldn\u2019t make him any less of a asshole.

You explained why you don't want to spend time with him. If he chooses to play dumb, that's a him problem. NTA", "NTA. You did a good thing. How does your father not understand what you told him? You were pretty specific about it. Your dad sounds a little narcissistic, meaning he feels like his feelings matter more than anybody else's. But the fact is that he's the adult, and he's expected to take your feelings into account in how he raises issues with you. It doesn't sound like he takes your feelings into account, but expects you to make his feelings all-important. That's just not right.", "NTA, \n\nand I snorted out loud over his hurt feelings... really? he just didn't like being called out.  \n\nGood for you!", "NTA. Your dad is an absolute jerk and seems like a massive narcissist. You did nothing wrong. Dad asked a question, tough shit that he didn\u2019t like the answer.

I'm so sorry.", "If your father had any decency he would have been apologetic for abusing you. But all he did was abuse you some more. \n\nWhy is an adult making it all about him? His feelings?

Your issues are not with him but you know you\u2019re fucking up but won\u2019t face it.\n\nDo something about your problem and stop blaming your dad.", "NTA - The fact that he yelled at you again instead of apologizing and trying to mend the damage shows that you not going to him was the right thing.", "A decent parent would wash their mouth out with bleach before speaking to their child as your father did to you. \n\nYou did absolutely nothing wrong, and your father has a lot of gall to whine about his hurt feelings when he is verbally and emotionally abusive. \n\nNTA.", "Wait a minute... you're 15 and your dad is fat shaming you for being average weight. At 5ft 8 average weight should be between 58kg and 71kg... even then its no one else's problem what weight you are than your own. You are totally NTA for telling this man how toxic he really is.", "NTA at all. I really wish I had the courage to say this to my dad when I was your age. This was a man who, when I was 3, literally tried to force feed me spaghetti. I started gaining weight at about 9 after my mom and dad divorced and when I was a teenager weighed between 200-250 pounds.  He used to corner me and say things like \"don't come crying to me if you get sick.\" Unfortunately it never occurred to me that I had a choice about not coming to see him and even now for that reason and others I rarely speak to him. So, seriously, good for you and good for your Mom.", "NTA. Wow, your dad is clueless. Refusing to acknowledge how he hurt you is incredibly immature.", "NTA. Your father is an abusive A-hole. You told him exactly what he needed to hear. Yes he didn't like it and he tried to gaslight you, but you didn't take any of that either. Awesome job for standing up for yourself and to your mother for sticking to your side of the whole thing. Keep it up hun.", "NTA You handled yourself quite well in explaining to him what he did and how it affected you as the reason why you no longer just came over to see your dad.\n\nAnd how he handled it pretty much validated your reasoning and just reinforced the fact that youi no longer want to see him anymore.", "NTA Wow. You-- \"I don't come because you scream at me.\"  \nDad--proceeds to scream at you.", "You are NTA!! You are amazing. Your father is an epic AH. Stay away from him as he is a manipulative abuser. And your mother knows too. Much love.", "NTA. I just looked up what that translates to in pounds for context (live in the US), and that is not only an incredibly healthy weight for your height, but also you don\u2019t have to have an explanation as to why you make the decision to spend time with the people you do or why you don\u2019t spend time with those that you don\u2019t. You have to protect your peace, and staying silent only protected his while it gave you only chaos in your heart. I\u2019m so sorry this all happened to you. Fathers are supposed to tell their daughters how beautiful and worthy they are which I\u2019m sure is the truth for you. Stay strong, gorgeous!", "NTA, don't let him ruin your relationship with food forever.
