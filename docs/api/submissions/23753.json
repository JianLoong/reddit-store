NTA", "NTA. I definitely feel like you should discuss names you like and consider a more unique middle name, but ultimately this IS a person not a pet. Lots of these names are more appropriate for pets. Your wife needs to be a bit more grounded in her selections. Fern isn't bad. Quincy isn't terrible either. But please don't name your kid Zoomer.", "I want to say N A H but those names are just terrible, so NTA. You seem to be looking for compromises and she's not. It sucks that it came out this way, but she doesn't seem to be getting how much you dislike her suggestions. Unfortunately, baby names are a situation where a parent has veto power. \n\nI think your suggestions are reasonable and could lend themselves to a nickname that's her style without being the legal name. Could you be more flexible with a middle name?", "NTA. So many people naming their kids like a 9 year old naming a goldfish or a valley girl naming a pocket dog.  Unfortunately, it indicates that the parent considering these names does not see the child as a person, but a thing, an amusing accessory to show all her fans how cool she is.\n\nThis is the first of many battles for the identity and autonomy of your child.", "NTA in general but this is tricky territory, and when you treat her badly you slip straight into AH territory.  You are definitely looking out for your child here, and your wife isn't thinking about the bullying these \"unique\" names will bring your child.\n\nWhen my husband and I were playing the \"name game\", part of the rules was to also think of what kind of taunts those names could turn into. Buck is an easy one to dismiss because it's one letter off from \"fuck\".  \"Fucky Bucky\", doesn't that sound like a great nickname? Lol.\n\nI think you'll find the perfect name but give her suggestions serious consideration like you expect her to give yours, then you can both play the name game and see how many awful nicknames might come out of them. \n\nAt least you'll be prepared and perhaps your wife will think a little bit more about what your child might have to endure depending on the name you both choose.", "My suggestion as someone who banned my husband from coming up with names..

As long as it wasn\u2019t more over the top than this post implies, I think you\u2019re good. But now that she knows, don\u2019t harp on it too much - just veto ones you hate and try and find a great name in between traditional & unique. \n\nOne of my favorites is Finley, or Finn! Since I see a lot of F/Ph names I thought I\u2019d throw it out. Close to her suggestions but more traditional. Or maybe find names that mean fox, or mean phoenix, etc. I bet you\u2019ll be able to find names close to her ideas that are more middle-of-the-road.", "NTA - while I do think acting in the way you did with your pregnant partner late in the pregnancy was ill advised, you ultimately do have your child's best interests at heart and you are right, it needed to be said. \n\nFor example, I was born in Europe and have a unisex name, when we moved to the states when I was a kid, I found out that (at least in the 90s) it was seen as a girls name. I was dragged for that the entire four years we lived there. And I genuinely have a fairly common name.

You don't sound like you were that rude; you only said the names were \"ridiculous.\" I think she overreacted. Maybe there was something in your tone of voice that made you sound ruder. Otherwise, it doesn't sound like she had any reason to cry.\n\nPersonally, I think most of her names are monumentally stupid. So I might've been ruder to her than you were. I thought your compromise choices were sensible. Though I can't see what was wrong w/her suggestions of Fern or Quincy. Fern's a pretty \"American heartland\" type of name (name of the girl in Charlotte's Web).\n\nAnd BTW. Don't think that a \"regular\" name will keep your kid safe from being bullied. Even if a kid's named \"Tom Smith\" a bully will find a way.\n\nReminds me a guy I knew who, in his punk rock days, named his dog \"Satan.\" He thought it was funny. When he got a bit older, he became embarrassed and changed the name. Don't let this happen to your kid!", "NTA. \nGood luck! Maybe the two of you could split the difference and have a more traditional first name and then the middle name can be less...like Oliver Phoenix or Elizabeth Fern?", "NTA. It's two yeses or one no for names. Can you compromise with a more unique first name and traditional middle name? Or vise versa. \n\nOf the names she suggested I think Rhodes or Buck are still somewhat common.", "NTA.

You recognized that snapping at her was the wrong thing to do, and make sure to own up to that with her.  But I can\u2019t lie, these names are terrible. As others have said, pick one for a nickname or a middle name, and perhaps agree on a family name for the first. My parents gave  me a non traditional nickname. Although the rest of the world knows me by my given name, they still call me by my nickname. It\u2019s a special name that I share with them.", "NTA those names are stupid and you would be setting your child up for problems.\n\nPerhaps a traditional name that can be shortened into a nickname.", "Dear god.

Fern for a girl is fine, so is Quincy or Buck for a boy.  Plenty of precedents for all three.
