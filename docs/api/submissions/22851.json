And you sound jealous, because I'm sure you're not doing it to defend the honor of the women he invited over by misrepresenting his wealth.\n\nPicking up girls by saying you're a millionaire is also trashy as fuck.  Especially when it's presented as if he has access to liquid assets, which is how most people interpret wealth.\n\nNo lady hears, \"I'm a millionaire,\" and assumes they're real estate rich and cash poor.  When you hear someone claim they're a millionaire, you assume they could take you on a nice vacation on short notice or get them a nice gift, like an expensive handbag or something similar, without having to go through escrow.  I guess he could technically open a HELOC, but seeing as he can't cover property taxes with his own income I would call that mismanaging money rather than \"being rich.\"\n\nIf you brag about your wealth but can't even afford the property taxes on your home you are technically a millionaire but not rich as most people would interpret the term. He's being technical and misrepresenting himself to get laid, and he knows it.\n\nSerious Question: Is the place still decorated like an old man lives there?  Is he really an investment advisor (I am guessing not, most people in the field say Financial Advisor).", "Info: is he an investment advisor? That feels very important as to the amount of \u201ccringe/being deceitful\u201d", "NAH\n\nWhat I take from this is not about the money, but about disapproving of his behavior. Lying about who he is and what he does to get laid is not a new thing, guys have been doing this forever. But yeah, I hate this behavior myself and find it kind of pathetic. Now technically speaking, if the house is worth a million and there is nothing more owed on it he is a millionaire. The house may not be a liquid asset, but it is an asset none the less. But the argument over semantics is pointless. I would we willing to bet that after renting it out to multiple friends, having parties, and trying to look like the cool rich guy he will fall in debt and the place will end up trashed and he will either have to sell it to pay off his debt or the back taxed he falls behind on. Either way, these stories usually end up the same way.", "YTA since he is right: if you own assets worth over a million, you\u2019re a millionaire.", "Yup. Elon musk doesnt have massess of cash in the bank. Or if he does he's an idiot", "his friend isn't lying though.    doesnt mean his friend isnt an ass for bragging about it", "I agree on the YTA part, but disagree on the friend (exfriend) not being a millionaire. I think the most common definition of a millionaire is someone with a net worth of a million dollars or more, NOT someone with a million or more in the bank. \n\nWhen Forbes does their richest people assessment a lot of that is tied in stock/company worth, not just how much they have in the bank.", ">ESH\n\nFor what? All the friend did was inherit property from a relative, tell the truth about his financial status, and have consensual sex with willing partners.", ">if the house is worth a million, he is a millionaire.   OP is jealous.", "thats not how it works.  if your net worth is greater than 1 million you are a millionaire.    its not about cash in a savings account", "And he technically is a millionaire. He could A.) sell the house and have a millions dollars in his bank account. B.) get a mortgage and have a million dollars in his bank account.\n\nCurious to know your definition of a millionaire OP.", "I think for that matter, you're right, his worth scales him up to millionaire standards. However, the friend does sound a like an idiot, most people have no idea how to handle money and it's highly likely he loses everything if he starts blowing the fortune in stupid things instead of investing it and accumulating more wealth. Being rich or a millionaire is not only about owning a million I think. But also about the financial education and mindset to keep it and grow it.\n\nHope he doesn't spend it stupidly and manages to stay rich.", "I don't understand why people think u need to have a million dollars in cash to eb a millionaire?? Isn't that called a cash millionaire or smtg?", "\"Being rich or a millionaire is not only about owning a million I think. But also about the financial education and mindset to keep it and grow it.\"\n\nNow I think you are conflating being a smart \"rich or millionaire\" with being a millionaire. I think it is black and white are you worth 1 million or not. If your net worth is 999,999.99 you are not a millionaire if it is 1,000,000.00 you are a millionaire. Your status can change depending on the second/minute/day/year as property values fluctuate. \n\nSo friend might be a millionaire right not but they might not always be if they spend it poorly. \n\n\" He rents out several bedrooms to make up for the taxes because he can\u2019t afford the upkeep of the home on his own.\"\n\nHonestly it sounds like friend while maybe not a smart millionaire is not a dumb millionaire, because he is taking roommates to afford the taxes on the place."]}
