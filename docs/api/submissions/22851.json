Now technically speaking, if the house is worth a million and there is nothing more owed on it he is a millionaire. The house may not be a liquid asset, but it is an asset none the less. But the argument over semantics is pointless. I would we willing to bet that after renting it out to multiple friends, having parties, and trying to look like the cool rich guy he will fall in debt and the place will end up trashed and he will either have to sell it to pay off his debt or the back taxed he falls behind on.

We don't know if the women slept with anyone, just that they came back to swim at the former friend's pool and have \\[blank\\], which I assume to be drinks. \n\nAssuming OP is a reliable narrator, his former friend is absolutely misrepresenting his wealth if he's casually dropping it as a pickup line.  Despite that, the women felt comfortable enough with OP and his friend group to join them after the club.  What this says about either the men or the women who were at the club that night is up to the reader, as none of us were there.", "I agree, but he has to rent out some rooms to afford covering the expenses that come with owning such a house. Technicaly, he is a millionare, just not in how much money he has in the bank.", "I mean he is blatantly lying about being an investment advisor", "Yes and no, the house may be worth 1 million dollars, but he has to rent out some rooms to cover the house expenses.", "> I don't know, I just can't wrap my head around having all of it just sitting in the bank.", "The smart thing is not to have much cash. \n\nMost of it should be assets. Shares, bonds etc.", "Fair comment, although I\u2019d say the amount was lower maybe 3.5 million to parental assistance.", "Lol, sure they are bud. \n\nBy self made you mean the sort of \u201cmy father gave me a small loan of two million dollars\u201d and access to contacts expertise and things like accountants lawyers ect.\n\nElon says he\u2019s self made, yet his dad owns a mine in South Africa and repeatedly floated his business start up expenses. \n\nMost successful people like to think they made it themselves, and rarely accept their privilege was a major factor in their own success.", "Mostly because of retirement savings.   401(k) plans can get big in the run-up to retirement.  A lot of that is employer contributions.  Is that still \"self-made\"?", "hahahahahhahahahaha", "Well, OP did say get laid. Let's say it is just swimming in the pool. Then it's even more of a non-issue. Though it doesn't change the fact the reason the women were interested and went back to the house was because of his wealth. Without further details, OP's friend is NOT misrepresenting his wealth. He is telling then he is a millionaire, which he is. If a man told me he was a millionaire, I would ABSOLUTELY assume that most of it is in money markets, real estate, stocks, bonds,etc. You keep a little liquid for when you need cash fast but otherwise it's dumb af to just leave it all in sitting in the bank.", "Has to or chooses to? \n\nIt\u2019s unlikely he was left a million dollar asset without any form of liquid - indeed the inheritances taxes on the estate would probably have forced a sale of the house if that had been the case. \n\nMaybe he just likes living with his boys and reducing his overheads ? He\u2019s quite a young guy, be weird to be on his own in a big house. \n\nOP just sounds very bitter this friend has gotten a big leg up in dating and finance.", "And that affects someone how?", "He has assets worth around million dollars so he's a millionaire.\nI cant understand why this bothers OP or anyone,only reason is jelaousy.", "That isn\u2019t a determining factor in whether someone is a millionaire.", "Well I know of 5 truly self made millionaires personally. No sense in arguing with a jealous person. Go read the research it'll prove I'm right.", "Well I don't know about you but my employer only matches 10% so no I don't think that's a lot. Most of my worth is real estate land investments that believe it or not I did not inherit anything although I'm not worth a million yet but hopefully one day I will be.", "The post gave me the impression he has to. In the end, it doesn't matter what I think, I'm not the one with a million dollar house or a (former) friend of someone who owns one.", "erm . . .", "None of us are \u201ctruly self-made.\u201d We all benefit from our circumstances in one way or another. Everything we do well or do right was done just as well or just as right by someone who didn\u2019t have the same good luck as we did.\n\nWe get what we get, not what we deserve. That is the human condition.", "I\u2019m not jealous mate, I have a great life. Own a bunch of different food vans hit the festival scene up and got some sites at a few tourist destinations which basically print money and manage themselves. \n\nPart time it work wise maybe 20 weeks a year if that, spend the rest of the time off with my kid and part time teacher girlfriend. We literally go on holiday every half term break. Life is really good man.\n\nI\u2019m just honest enough to say the only reason I managed to accomplish this is because my rich grandad bought me the vans, the commercial kitchen and storage and the first few site booking fees. And then decided to forgive the considerable debt as a birthday present. \n\nBut I could just as easily talk here about how I worked my ass off in other restaurants  from the the age of 15, starting out pot washing. Did 70 hour weeks before i got the first Van and then two and did it all myself - which is the way most successful people spin it, I just think it\u2019s deeply misleading mate.", "Defending rich people on the internet will definitely get you there! That\u2019s how it works!", "Im not even sure OP is a reliable narrator tbh, I read it more as bitterness like \u2018look he can\u2019t afford it he had to rent the rooms out\u2019 as opposed to a pretty sound decision to reduce overheads and possibly even bring in income. \n\nPlus live with your friends is really fun at that age particularly in a big house with a pool. Honestly sounds like the mate is living the dream tbh.", "OP is jelaous his friend is getting laid bruh,what a loser", "All I am saying the post is about a guy being jelaous because he thinks his friend is lying to be a milionaire not being a invesment advisor", "Wrong.", "Exactly. People tend to highlight everything they did right, everything that makes them feel deserving, and dismiss all the ways in which they were simply fortunate. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean people no one worked hard to get what they have; it just means that we shouldn\u2019t be so full of ourselves as to believe that our good fortune is the inevitable outcome of our own efforts.", "Was I defending anyone? I don't believe so. Just stated a fact that was from a few research studies. Not some bs pulled out of my ass like the person I replied to originally.", "Not defending anyone.  I'm suggesting your wealth threshold is low.", "yah whenever someone points out you might be doing something bad they are just jelly bro", "Oh sorry! I thought I was replying to Larry", "He didnt point out he is wrong,he told him he isnt a millionaire and try to convice him he isnt...thats just sad being that jelaous", "You were replying to Larry. Looks like Larry has a second account and forgot which one he was using."]}
