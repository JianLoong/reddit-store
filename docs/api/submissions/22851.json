Now technically speaking, if the house is worth a million and there is nothing more owed on it he is a millionaire. The house may not be a liquid asset, but it is an asset none the less. But the argument over semantics is pointless. I would we willing to bet that after renting it out to multiple friends, having parties, and trying to look like the cool rich guy he will fall in debt and the place will end up trashed and he will either have to sell it to pay off his debt or the back taxed he falls behind on.
