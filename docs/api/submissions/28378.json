She gets a surprising amount of sales on there too, and has great reviews.\n\nThe issue is that EVERYWHERE we go, EVERY conversation she has, she slips in something about her shop and tries to promote it. Talking to a friend? She'll casually mention a big sale she made or a custom order she got and not-very-subtly mention that she'd give her friend a coupon or something similar. Talking to our waiter?

I went with my wife, and she's a pretty social person even outside of promoting her shop so she was quickly making conversation with my family. Of course not 5 minutes later she was showing someone the bracelet she had on that she made and mentioning that she sells them and talking about how since they were family she would happily give them a 25% discount. She probably had that exact same conversation with at least 5 people during the 2 hours we were there.\n\nAs soon as we left I spoke to her and said she needs to quit doing that.

She got upset and said that she just wants to spread her product and doesn't see what she's doing wrong and hasn't spoken to me much since. I feel like I'm the asshole since I will admit I had a pretty harsh tone and could've been a lot nicer during that conversation, plus I get she's just trying to sell her products, even if it gets obnoxious.

I hate pushy sales people.  She can promote her jewelry on instagram or even set up a special facebook page and invite people to join.  But every conversation, that's a \"no\" from me.", "INFO\n\nDoes it just bother you or does it bother other people as well? Does your wife try to promote to the same person more than once? \n\nIf no to both of those, then you would be TA because your wife can do what she likes and you should be supportive of her.\n\nIf yes to those questions, then everyone sucks. It would be rude of her to keep trying but you would also suck a little for being too harsh.", "There's middle ground here, but I'm going with YTA because of your delivery.\n\nShe has a right, and if she's really trying to make a go of the business, an obligation to promote herself. She chooses to do it informally, person to person, which is just fine.\n\nI can see, however, that the two of you probably need to have a \"no business hats\" night where the focus is on each other.\n\nMaybe bring that up (gently) after apologizing to her for being TA here.", "YTA for what you said and how you said it. You are NTA for having these feelings though. It comes across quite rude and self absorbed to always be plugging your own business at every opportunity so its understandable. Apologise and explain to her nicely", "Esh you were harsh and she sounds excessive. I don't want to have products pushed on me when I go to an event with family or friends, personally, unless the event is explicitly for that.", "YTA for your approach. NTA for trying to keep her from damaging her relationships. People are going to g to start avoiding her. She sounds like an MLM Hun, only she actually does have her own business. But she\u2019s going to end up a lonely woman with a thriving business.", "YTA even the way you talk about her shop when she isn\u2019t promoting isn\u2019t nice\u2026. \n\n\u201cShe gets a surprising amount of sales on there too\u201d \n \nWhy? You admitted her work is good, what\u2019s wrong with you. Have you done anything to show your support of her? Word of mouth is the best for small businesses. She\u2019s networking with the resources available. Authenticity sells. With a faux supportive partner, someone has to do it. \n\nYou are correct in feeling like TA. You shit on her passion.", "ESH.  Her for pushing her products on anyone and everyone she has a conversation with.  That's not going to help her business in the long run.  And family should be off limits unless they specifically ask her about her shop (because clearly they've all heard about it by now).  But you are also TA for the way you talked with her.", "Sounds like her business is doing pretty well, and consistently promoting it is probably at least part of the reason for that. Also, it just seems to me that she\u2019s just very passionate and excited about what she does. You should be proud of and happy for her; not everyone has the opportunity to do what they love and be successful at it. Verdict: YTA. Not the worst one I\u2019ve seen on here by any stretch of the imagination, but it sounds like you owe her an apology. In the future it would probably be helpful to refrain from these types of remarks. She\u2019s not doing anything wrong, and while you\u2019re certainly entitled to your own opinion, when all it does is hurt a loved one\u2019s feelings maybe it\u2019s best kept to yourself.", "As someone who was a server, it made me slightly uncomfortable when people tried to push that stuff on me. But as an artist I get it but it\u2019s kinda like the vegan who has to tell everyone they are vegan\u2026 it\u2019s annoying. You should have been nicer but she doesn\u2019t have to tell absolutely everyone.", "NTA  \n\n\nShe is doing it over and over.   \n\n\nI sell on eBay, have for 23 years. I make damn good money.

There is a great divide between business and socializing.", "Always Be Closing, amirite?", "Yes, you answered your own question. You were harsh and there\u2019s no need to be.", "It comes off disingenuous for a person to just talk about their products or business. It shouldn\u2019t take over one\u2019s body identity or ability to just socialize with family and friends. I personally cannot stand that type of person. NTA.", "NTA She is annoying and needs to back off.  I go to family events to relax and enjoy the company, not deal with commercials.", "You really need to ask whether or not you're the asshole?!\n\nYou admit you were rude, harsh, and basically crapped on your wife. You also admit you could've been a lot nicer.\n\nOf course, she's not talking much to you, because she thinks her husband really doesn't support her or has her back.\n\nYou really stepped in it. Explain your position, which is a very reasonable position, without being a complete AH about it. \n\nYTA.", "YTA- she\u2019s doing what smart successful people do to make money, which is market literally every second you can. She\u2019s motivated and has the guts to put herself out there and market. Good for her, you\u2019re being an ass about it.\n\nYou might not care, but who knows who else will and she had every right to talk about such an important part of her life. Mind your business, these conversations didn\u2019t seem to involve you anyway", "How is it supposed to turn into a big business if she doesn\u2019t promote it? Like really think about that", "YTA. That\u2019s exactly how you drum up business when you\u2019re a small business owner. Word of mouth is so vital. Support her, also tell people about her jewellery. \n\nI\u2019m shocked that you even have to ask if YTA to be honest.", "ESH. People like your wife drive me crazy. But you went nuclear.", "YTA.\n\nBruh, your wife is *hustling*. Have you never been to a networking event or conference? This is literally how you recruit people and market your products! At the end of the day, it doesn't matter if your product is software or a bracelet, marketing is marketing. This is what it takes to make that product succeed and not taking those opportunities, not telling people your name and your product, is why small businesses fail with no one even knowing they existed to begin with. She has guts!\n\nJust because you don't get it or have the capacity to understand basic marketing doesn't mean she's the problem here.", "YTA", "YTA. \n\nYou should support your partner's endeavours as a good, supportive partner anyway.  \n\nAlso, you didn't mention any negative/awkward reactions from others, just your own... Maybe people are not so bothered or think too much of it. Worst case scenario they will not buy anything. That's it. \n\nSounds like you are embarrassed and if you really said to her that nobody cares about her small business (while she clearly does) then I hope her talent and sales skyrocket her into a millionaire and dumps your butt.", "YTA, support your wife buddy. Even if it annoys you to death.", "YTA. A small business owner has to promote themselves and the best way to do that is in their every day interactions with people. It\u2019s effective and it\u2019s free. It sounds like she\u2019s just informing people that she has a product they might enjoy. She\u2019s not pushing them to buy jewelry. \n\nIf you don\u2019t like the fact that she is using your social outings to promote her business, why not help her do other things to promote it? For example, she can do paid advertising on social media or she could set up a booth markets or events where she could sell her products in person. That costs money though. You could make it a compromise: if you help her establish a regular flow of customers, she will stop promoting her jewelry whenever you go out.", "YTA. Most likely, her attitude is the reason for the success of her small business. You should be happy for her.", "YTA. Are you always so nasty to her? Do ever actually show her any encouragement? Are you jealous of her success? You don't sound like much of a partner.", "YTA\n\nIf a family or friend was making and selling something like this I wouldn't mind at all if they told me about it. So long as she isn't annoying people or being on obnoxious. You haven't said anyone has complained about it, so sounds to me like she knows when to stop.", "YTA\n\nHow is she supposed to promote her shop if she doesn't talk about?\n\nNow she knows/thinks you are not supportive.", "That\u2019s hella mean! She\u2019s just passionate and loves what she\u2019s doing. I feel like it\u2019s only a problem if you\u2019ve gotten feedback regarding her \u201cpushiness.\u201d YTA for kinda lashing out. Your feelings are valid but it should have been a separate conversation on a different day.", "YTA\n\nIt's not like she is hardselling the jewelry. She's selling her jewelry in the most polite way a friend/family member can.", "Wow encouraging partner alert she is proud of her work she should show it of good on her you should also do it to show your support. I hope she only gets better in spite of your lack of support", "YTA. What do you think networking events are? Small business owners need to market and she\u2019s choosing to do it organically when she\u2019s out and about. That is perfectly fine! Clearly something is working since she\u2019s making sales.\n\nI work in marketing. I\u2019m an analyst but still, I\u2019m in the industry. She\u2019s doing it correctly.", "YTA. Time for her to put you on the clearance page. I mean really - do you even like your wife?", "YTA, she\u2019s your wife and you admit she\u2019s good at what she does.

If she keeps doing this to friends and family she is going to get slotted into the same category as religious people who proselytize everywhere they go: someone to be avoided. There\u2019s a difference between talking about your business (or religion) and promoting it. Talking to friends and family is fine, but promoting to people you see often is obnoxious. If they are interested in buying they will ask.\n\nThere is also a difference between a captive audience with a power differential and one that can freely  walk away.  Someone who\u2019s job it is to serve you like a wait staff don\u2019t have the freedom to not listen to her sales pitch because they are relying on your tip and their job is to \u201cmake you happy.\u201d They  have no way of knowing how your wife will react to being cut off so they are forced to listen.\n\nYou suck for the way you had the conversation. She sucks for making the conversation necessary.", "ESH.  Your wife needs to find a balance between promoting her business and not pushing it incessantly.

You both need to talk this out together.", "NTA, your wife sounds rather pushy, and people absolutely will get tired of it and just avoid her if she continues to make every conversation and basically her entire personality all about her business and jewelry.

But it seems to me that if it came to the OP's attention that this upsets others, he would include it in his post. So it seems to me that only he is upset by her attitude.

Her work is great and definitely deserves the sales it gets", "Most successful business owners say the exact opposite of what you\u2019re saying. Everyone you interact with is a potential customer including family members. For most business owners, their customer base began with their loved ones.

Great. Leave her alone and let her do her things because clearly it\u2019s working. She has those sales in part because she promotes", "But it sound like she's one of those people who ruin things by immediately bringing up their shop/product and pushing it on people.  I say that based on what OP says in his post.  It's one thing if someone compliments something she's wearing and she then says \"oh I made it myself.  I have a shop if you want to check it out.\"  It's another to hunt for some opening to bring it up.  Like the \"Oh, I've earrings on my shop that would compliment your eyes.\" she says to their waitress.  If I was the waitress that would cause me to have a hard eye roll and reply back, Oh, OK.  Then I would go about my work.", "No, this is MLM business advice. Actually successful business owners in this model don\u2019t start out by shilling to their friends and family - they start out taking requests from loved ones to create jewelry or cakes or whatever they\u2019re good at, realize what they could be popular with a wider audience, and start charging for it. \n\nPeople generally don\u2019t like it when family members treat them the same way a watch salesman at the mall would. It breeds resentment, and that\u2019s not only bad for relationships, it\u2019s bad for business. If she wants to sell to friends and family, she\u2019d be better off creating social media and a mailing list so there\u2019s a separation between business and personal interactions, and so people can opt out of being sold to.", "Except he said in another comment that his family is not receptive to it and she pitches to the same people often. That\u2019s not acceptable.", "I\u2019m the exact opposite. I love jewelry and clothing so I\u2019m always interested in talking about things like this. You and I are different types of people but a business owner wouldn\u2019t know which type of person they\u2019re speaking with until they actually start the conversation.", "I disagree. I\u2019ve heard many independent business owners give this advice to people who are just starting out. It doesn\u2019t sound like OP\u2019s wife is acting like a salesman in a mall. She\u2019s just letting people know that she\u2019s still making jewelry and she\u2019s willing to give a discount if they\u2019re interested."]}
