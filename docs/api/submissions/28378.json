Of course not 5 minutes later she was showing someone the bracelet she had on that she made and mentioning that she sells them and talking about how since they were family she would happily give them a 25% discount.

Not the worst one I\u2019ve seen on here by any stretch of the imagination, but it sounds like you owe her an apology. In the future it would probably be helpful to refrain from these types of remarks.

Compromise is key.\r  \n\r  \nPromoting is a must for any small business, but discretion and timing are also important for maintaining relationships. Maybe try roleplaying some scenarios with her so she can practice reading social cues better.

With open communication and flexible boundaries, I'm sure you can find a balanced approach.", "Self promotion is not a bad thing, and you should mention your business as much as possible.
