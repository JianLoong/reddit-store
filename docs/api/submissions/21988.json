If she was really giving the wrong number to people on accident then why is she cussing you out for telling the people looking for her the correct number.

I came to the conclusion she must have had my number as a house phone number a long time ago and with age her memory would slip and she'd give out her old number. It was so annoying. Kept telling these people over and over to check with her for her actual number. Nothing changed. Until the day some called for her and I told her Hatriet had died \ud83e\udd37. That shit got fixed immediately,  never had a call for her again. Do what ya gotta do.", "NTA. I have a number very similar to a business.
