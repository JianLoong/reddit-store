I didn't even know how to spell her name in the beginning either so I couldn't find her on social media to tell her to stop.\n\nAbout 4 years ago though, I was at PetSmart and gave them my phone number for rewards points. I noticed that Jane had used my phone number and even updated it to her name. I took the opportunity to take a picture of her name to look it up later. Lo and behold, there's only two people in US with that name. One lives in CA, and the other lives in GA (where I live). I found her address on a public website and sent her a letter.\n\nNext morning, I received a phone call and the number was very similar to mine. Let's say last 4 digits of my phone number is 1234, and the other party's ends with 1324. The rest are the same. I answered it and it's the Jane lady. She was apologizing profusely and said it'll never happen again.\n\nFor a couple of months, it really did stop. The second it started again, I texted Jane that she needs to stop. She got upset and claims she's never used my phone number for anything. (I mean... 5 different OBGYN's offices in 3 years says a lot.)\n\nAfter that interaction, I started giving out Jane's phone number whenever I got calls asking for her. Now Jane is upset by this and has been cussing me out.\n\nI've already blocked her and laughing about it. Petty, yes, but I don't think I'm an asshole.

Well, I let them know it was the wrong number and the caller was confusing because they had just received this number the week before. I let them know that I'd had the number for a couple of years and been fielding these calls the whole time. She seemed very interested to learn this thanked me and hung up.\n\nFrom then on, whenever I got calls for this person I let them know they're being dodged. If I got texts to confirm things, I always canceled. Doctors appointments, even some court dates if I understood right.\n\nIt fills me with a wonderful sense of schadenfreude.  Haven't had an issue with the number in several years now.

So if she hasn't malicious intends and is handing the wrong number out on purpose you are doing everyone a favour? Her and the people looking for her. How could this be considered petty? Its not even revenge, you are just correcting a mistake someoneelse made. Also I doubt the phone number is the only way a dept collecter could find her and hold her accountable.
