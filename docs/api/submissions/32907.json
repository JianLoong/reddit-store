AITA if i dont let her around me or my child again? some people think im the asshole if i do because itll effect my dad but i tried doing things his way and im just done. im not going to be disrespected that way, not after all the other shit ive let go for my dads sake.

I\u2019d just like to make a couple of points:\n\n1. Your stepmother was out of line, and so was your father. They don\u2019t know the pain you\u2019ve been through, and belittled your concern.\n\n2. This may be off base, but I\u2019m speaking as someone who has seen this first hand. PLEASE don\u2019t keep your child in a \u2018bubble\u2019. Once he gets vaccinated, it is important to socialize babies and take them out and about. Vaccines are an important part of building an immune system, as is mother\u2019s milk. SO IS exposing them to normal, every day people. He will catch a bug now and then, but it will help his immune system to grow and adapt.\n\nNow of course, if he develops an autoimmune condition, then that is a different story, but that\u2019s a bridge you cross when you get there.\n\nI only say this because I\u2019ve seen other parents overcompensate and it ended up being harder for all concerned.\n\nGod bless, and congratulations again!", "This woman sounds like a narc and your dad is the enabler.

He chose to continue to let his wife disrespect you and your rules. Why does he get extra chances?\n\nCut them both out and keep your baby safe.", "Absolutely edited as pointed out NTH. You have your reasons for your rules. The child is vulnerable. At this point in time.  Whether or not they may have developed immunity from you is irrelevant you need to be cautious, and therefore should be.\n\nYou certainly do need to keep your child safe. There may be a time in the future after your child has been vaccinated, that you may feel more comfortable.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems your stepmother feels like she\u2019s entitled in above any rules. You are focused on your child as it should be.", "INFO: What rules were broken exactly? It sounds she wasn't actively sick, but has gotten sick in the past. Also, did you already know she worked in elementary education? \n\nIn general, I would say NTA for breaking the rules, but I'm just overall curious about the exact rules because it sounds like she may not have intentionally broken the rules.", "NTA\n\nMy best friend has an immune disorder, and it's not just me who's extremely careful, my entire family and all my friends, even my co-workers, do everything they can to help. If anyone has gotten sick after seeing me, or they've been in contact with people who are sick, they let me know. We all do our best to ensure that she can lead as normal and healthy a life as we can manage.\n\nWhile none of us is under the illusion that we can keep anyone completely safe, especially since covid hit, and the whole world (or most of it, anyway) got a wake-up call about how vulnerable we now all are, we do try. And no, you won't be able to shield your child entirely, that's just not possible, your father's wife should **not** have done this with a child who's too young to be fully vaccinated, especially when you have no way of knowing if he has inherated a immune deficiancy. We were incredibly cautious with my best friend's son until he was vaccinated, and still did our best after, because, like your child, he may have a genetical disposition.\n\nPlease send my comment to your father, because even if he is trying to be a good husband, he should understand the risks he is inflicting on his grandchild. It is not just irresponsible, it's cruel and he should be ashamed of the dangers he willingly exposed both his own daughter and his grandchild to.", "INFO: Which of your \"rules with germs\" do you believe she actually broke?

She gets so many respiratory issues because she smokes which was another discussion with her that she ignores. I\u2019m so tired of it and now my son has to come first and my dads feelings no longer matter", "Thank you so much! She is definitely out of line and definitely not considered my stepmother lol that\u2019s part of the problem with her, she thought when she married my dad she was finally getting daughters because she only has a son but we were adults, we were grown. We also never developed a relationship with her because of who she is as a person and when the baby came into the picture the entitlement blew up and she became very pushy and then very petty and would do cause problems and throw a fit because she wasn\u2019t getting her way. She\u2019s really shown her true colors through all this. Also absolutely, we plan on bringing him out once he has his vaccines. My oncologist told me the same thing about if he\u2019s in a bubble his whole life it\u2019ll only cause issues so it\u2019s better to give him exposure safely, we just really wanted to be extra careful before the vaccines which her and my dad knew", "That\u2019s exactly was this was, it was her revenge for me not giving her what she wants. She\u2019s absolutely a narcissist and she manipulates my dad.

I also named my son after my dad and the idea of my son not knowing his namesake is killing me", "That\u2019s what bothers me too, it wasn\u2019t like I was saying had I known this information she would never see my child, I explained to them after the fact I would have waited until after his vaccines, she feels entitled to the things my parents have and that I allow them to have. Me and my sister consider her my dads wife, we were adults when they got together and she\u2019s never been a parent to us, she has a son but wanted daughters and she thought me and my sister would play that part but we were grown and we don\u2019t exist to fill a void in her life. We were always nice and civil despite her being the way she is and causing problems through the years and any other relationship with her never developed, she\u2019s uncomfortable to be around and to interact with so nothing formed. When they baby came into the picture it was all about trying to be grandma and all this other stuff but when I would try to meet her halfway and compromise she would throw a fit and cry to my dad and put him in the middle. She wanted a name, I gave her a nickname, she didn\u2019t like it, asked for the name my mom was going to use, I said no and now she was going by her name and she threw a tantrum. She wanted to be at the hospital, I said no, she threw a tantrum so I had to tell my dad he wasn\u2019t welcome. The baby shower she asked my sister to help plan it my sister said she didn\u2019t need help my mom was helping, she cried to my dad and had him text my mom to ask her to include her, it\u2019s things like this, like she expects to do mother things when there\u2019s no relationship and she\u2019s jealous of my mom and the fact my parents stayed friends and has ruined their friendship because of the shit like this she pulls, she\u2019s delusional and feels entitled to things she\u2019s not a part of, won\u2019t accept any compromise and then does things like expose my child on purpose just to get her way and feel like she\u2019s having the last laugh, I\u2019m tired of it", "I think you meant to put NTA.  N A H means no assholes here, and it\u2019s pretty clear OP\u2019s stepmother is an AH", "She\u2019s always sick, she is not a careful person, she\u2019s had Covid so many times lol and the rules were especially because me and my fianc\u00e9 know people and family with kids in school or who work in school, the rule was none of them can visit or be around baby until he has his vaccines to lessen his chances of getting sick, she has never worked in education and technically she\u2019s a class volunteer, she knew If I knew this I would not have brought the baby so she withheld that information and only told me after as a kind of F you situation. Another rule was if they were in crowds or out an about a lot that week to wear a mask, I was assured they were careful and didn\u2019t go anywhere that week and if they did they wore a mask and it wasn\u2019t crowded. They didn\u2019t wear masks. I went over the rules with her again right before she held me she assured me she\u2019d never put him at risk and then does exactly that. I also made sure she knew if the rules were broken there were no second chances", "Thank you for understanding and for being a good friend to your friend who goes through this. I completely understand that things happen and even with being careful someone can still get sick, and I also understand the position my dad is in and I\u2019ve been very sympathetic to that for years. If it would\u2019ve been just like they were around someone sick but they had no symptoms and didn\u2019t think of it to let me know because it slipped their mind or they didn\u2019t find out until after, that\u2019s understandable but this feels deliberate and when I brought it up to my dad the next day when I called him he for the first time in my life he sounded insincere and like he didn\u2019t care which is strange because he\u2019s always been careful with me with my autoimmune", "We set rules that people who were going to meet the baby had to have TDAP and our friends and family who worked with kids or have kids in school would have to wait until after the baby had his vaccines to meet him and hold him. She knew that rule. We also had asked her and my dad if they\u2019re were in any crowded places or exposed to anything, they said they weren\u2019t. They both knew had they told me she was working with kids I would\u2019ve waited for her to meet him until after his vaccines and my dad\u2019s visits would\u2019ve been stopped until the vaccines as well. We are very careful and put rules in place specially to avoid the kind of exposure that comes with school aged children", "I really did try, so many conversations, I brought my dad with me to my therapist, I made compromises, I tried to be a reasonable adult but this woman is incapable of being one. She has pushed and pushed and I absolutely feel like she did this deliberately to get back at me. We definitely want no contact with her, unsure about my dad", "She\u2019s completely out, I\u2019m still trying to figure my dad out. I\u2019ve had so many conversations with him explaining he\u2019s risking his relationship with me and his grandson and I didn\u2019t want it to get to this point, I tried to cut her out before the baby was born but as a courtesy for my dad I agreed that once I was settled after baby was born I\u2019d meet with them and see if we can work through these issues and I explained to him she had one chance, if she disrespected me that was it and the first thing she did was disrespect, I just can\u2019t keep doing this and I won\u2019t put my son in the middle of this or at risk again. She is toxic and if he wants that in his life that\u2019s fine but it won\u2019t be in mine or my sons", "Definitely where I\u2019m at", "My priority is definitely my son, I am absolutely done making My exceptions for him. I did so because for a bit after the baby was born he was great, he seemed to have really heard my concerns and he was respecting my rules and boundaries and I also have to think about my sister, I don\u2019t want to make her life and relationship with him complicated, even though she is 100% on my side and has had my back and she also doesn\u2019t like his wife, I don\u2019t want her to be put in the middle when it comes to events. I made it clear to her I won\u2019t be at anything that they\u2019re at and she respects that but she also doesn\u2019t want to have to split things even more than they already are which I get. Also my dad was doing great at respecting my boundaries after I cut his wife out the first time, this is the first time since the baby was born that he fucked up, and most of his fuck ups while I was pregnant was more so him calling me every time his wife cried or bitched or threw a tantrum and would see if I\u2019d consider a compromise and if I\u2019d do it for him or he would try to make her seem like a sad little victim who is just sensitive and just wants to be included but she made it clear just being included isn\u2019t enough for her, my dad is just living in the illusion that we can get past anything and all be able to be civil and get along but we are past that now", "She definitely doesn\u2019t clean herself properly, she\u2019s a smoker and I told her ahead of time no smoking if she wants to hold baby, no perfume, wash hands and I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s currently sick or the last time she was sick, she made it point to tell me the kids have already gotten her sick twice since she started there a few weeks ago. I wouldn\u2019t put it past her to be sick. She tried to take baby out of my arms as soon as I walked in, without washing hands and I had to remind her before she held him to wash hands. But this is also a woman who I\u2019ve witnessed smoke two cigarettes near a baby and after smoking those cigarettes not wash her hands and feed that baby with her hands and put them in the baby\u2019s mouth and it was good the baby wasn\u2019t supposed to eat and she also didn\u2019t know the baby or the mother, it was my sisters niece that she was just meeting, another reason I had set certain rules with her, she doesn\u2019t think before she says or does anything because all she cares about is herself", "Thank you! And oh yea, I called him the next day and called him out on it cause if I would\u2019ve said something when she told me as they were leaving it would not have been pretty. His excuse was it never crossed his mind and because I don\u2019t ask about his wife it never came up. That conversation was the first in my life that I had with my dad that felt so insincere. He then texted me after to tell me she\u2019s only there 3 days a week for a couple of hours, as if that matters. I texted back it doesn\u2019t matter how long, there are kids in daycare for a few hours 3 days a week and are always sick and getting other people sick, it\u2019s not how long she was there, it\u2019s not even that she is there, I think it\u2019ll be good for her to spend time in the school and to back off my child, it\u2019s the fact they didn\u2019t tell me so that I could make the conscious decision of whether to hold off on the visit or not, I then texted him and told him me and my fianc\u00e9 are very upset with him and we need some space so we can focus on our child", "She absolutely is and I know! I used to work in childcare but obviously with my autoimmune it didn\u2019t work out lol I was constantly getting sick and having to take time off cause I didn\u2019t want to spread anything back to the kids, it\u2019s a vicious cycle in the schools, it goes around and around. She\u2019s never worked with kids before, she\u2019s not around kids a lot and when she is she has zero common sense, I\u2019ve watched her meet a baby for the first time, smoke like two cigarettes near the baby and then with her dirty hands take a piece of cake that the baby was too young to have and put it in her mouth with her fingers and let baby lick the icing off her finger, the baby\u2019s mother was appalled and didn\u2019t even know what to do or how to approach it. This woman has zero social skills, respect, common sense or decency, I have yet to meet someone who enjoys being around her. She\u2019s technically retired but what I\u2019m guessing happened is that when I had originally cut her out months ago and told my dad the reasons why I had mentioned I thought she had some form of untreated mental illness and needed therapy and he made a point to tell me a few weeks ago she was in therapy, so I think the therapist probably told her to start volunteering with kids so that it wouldn\u2019t matter she wasn\u2019t allowed near mine. She\u2019s never expressed a desire to work with kids, she complained about the work and just made a point to tell me they consider her the class foster grandma and that they lover her so much they\u2019re always hugging her and because of that they\u2019ve gotten her sick twice and she\u2019s only been there a few weeks, so it\u2019s literally just about her being able to play grandma to a bunch of kids or something, it\u2019s very strange to me", "OP clarified them in the comments", "One of the rules was that people who work with children shouldn't hold the baby until after vaccinations.", "She withheld information that puts my son at risk. The tdap does not cover Covid which she had constantly, doesn\u2019t cover rsv, the flu, a common cold at this point for an infant especially one that might have an autoimmune is risky. I should also add to this that in this same week my son was referred to a neurosurgeon for an issue with his skull so it was already a rough week for me with worrying about him so maybe it is a little paranoia but I don\u2019t appreciate them withholding information and lying to me when I ask about exposure. My dad and his wife were already on thin ice because of all the issues they caused when I was pregnant and this was supposed to be us working things out and they just straight up disrespected the rules and broke mine and my finances trust", "My rules are for safety and they aren\u2019t a million, the ones that were stressed for safety which millions of moms put in place are no visitors who don\u2019t have their tdap, no visitors who traveled recently, no one who works with kids can hold the baby until he has vaccines and they have to wear masks, same if they were in crowded place like an event, wear a mask when visiting, no school aged kids around baby and no parents of school aged kids holding baby until he has vaccines, no kissing the baby, wash your hands, no touching his face and we asked anyone who held him to just not hold him by their face. The rules that we broken were I was not made aware that she started volunteering at a school with kids ahead of time, I would not have let her hold him otherwise or I would\u2019ve at least asked she wore a mask, I\u2019m not unreasonable. The problem is I went over these things before I handed him to her and she said nothing, not until after and she made sure to tell me she\u2019s been sick twice in the last few weeks that she\u2019s been working there, which I also didn\u2019t know. Her intentions were to disrespect me and that\u2019s the problem, and I know her intentions were to disrespect because this isn\u2019t the only issue with her, she\u2019s mad because she\u2019s not getting her way and I\u2019ve set boundaries in my life and that she doesn\u2019t have the relationship she wants with me and my sister", "It\u2019s not just that she put my baby at risk, she did it purposefully for one to get back at me because I won\u2019t give in to her entitled demands. She\u2019s caused so many issues, this meeting was not just a meeting, it was a huge step for me to agree to see her for one and two let her meet my baby, I agreed for my dads sake to give her a chance to show me I could trust her and that she would respect the rules and boundaries and she deliberately and immediately did not. This was me giving her a chance and it wouldn\u2019t be such a big deal had they told me she was working in a school, I would\u2019ve just asked that we wait until baby had vaccines or even if once I got there they told me, I would\u2019ve just either had them wear a mask or just not hold the baby yet. I\u2019m not unreasonable I would\u2019ve worked with them, but every single time I try to work something out with this woman or compromise she creates a huge problem, this was just the last straw, you don\u2019t get to cause all these issues and then when I try to fix things for my fathers sake you risk my child\u2019s health", "My child was held by everyone in our lives by the time we left the hospital. She never got sick. She actually never got sick in the first 3 years so I was beginning to worry that she wasn't getting immunity to anything but I didn't have to worry...she started Kinder and got 200 viruses in a day so we're good now \ud83e\udd74\n\nUltimately, this isn't the woman's daughter and it's not her grandchild - she needs to focus on her relationship with the husband and let the rest go.", "NTA your dad knew she was working in a school with young kids and that they get her sick and he didn\u2019t say anything. He asked you to let his wife hold your baby. It\u2019s not just his wife pushing your boundaries and not respecting you, it\u2019s him too.", "It sounds like you have the bases covered. Awesome!", "Forgive me but a good man does not put his own grandson at risk of germs and diseases. And a good man stands up for what is right, even if it makes some people unhappy.", "Okay, with that being cleared up, NTA for me. Especially if her job changed and is now working with kids and never has before type of thing.", "Ah. That makes this pretty simple. NTA.", "Respect is a two way street. She obviously has none for you. The question now is does your father??  Hopefully so. If not, he\u2019s made the choice for you as hard as that may be. \n\nIt just starts here. It can easily get much worse.", "Good for you. This is the way. Having contact with our kids is not a right. It is a priviledge.", "I agree, I have no idea what to do about my dad. I literally named my son after him and wanted so bad for them to have a good relationship, I made so many exception for him and compromises when it came to his wife for him and he couldn\u2019t even do me the courtesy of giving me a heads up. He 100% did it to shut her up and make her happy and I understand and respect that\u2019s his wife and he\u2019s going to want to keep her happy but it shouldn\u2019t be at the expense of his daughters rules and boundaries and his grandsons health", "He used to be like that, it\u2019s only been the last few years he\u2019s been like this, I think he\u2019s afraid to die alone and with his age he\u2019s just letting things slide. He\u2019s highly allergic to cats but allowed her to get them, he can\u2019t breathe in his own house, he\u2019s confided to one room that he won\u2019t allow the cats in and has to go for allergy shots and take medication, I feel bad for him", "I don\u2019t feel like any rules I had set were unreasonable, they were put in place for safety and what we were comfortable with but this woman pushed every rule and boundary and I was used to her pushing my ones about her but the ones about safety, I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d sink this low", "She has zero respect for me, she wants what she wants and I won\u2019t give it to her so now she just causes issues wherever she can. We were civil before this, I never liked her but I was always respectful and nice for my dads sake because I never wanted to make his life hard or effect his marriage, I only want to see my dad happy but I can\u2019t make him happy in this situation and he has to either accept that or step away", "I love that, it definitely is a privilege especially in this instance. I didn\u2019t always have the best relationship with my dad, it took us a long time and a lot of work on both of our parts to build a good relationship and once we had, I cherished it, we had become very close and then a few years later he met his now wife and it changed again, I never addressed it until my son, I had kind of just accepted this was how it was now but then with my son, I just wanted me dad back, I wanted to be close again, I named my son after him thinking that would be a way to rebuild that bond and to bond him and my son and to also always keep him close to me. And then his wife started so many problems and I tried so hard for my dads sake cause I don\u2019t wanna break his heart and cut him out but he\u2019s not really leaving me a choice", "NTA, and I'm sorry, but actions speak louder that words.  \nI'm in my 50s, and spent the 1st 35ish years of my life making exceptions and excuses for my dad. In the end, it's just that, actions speak louder that words.  \nHe said what he did, so she would get what she wanted, her want is more important than his grandsons health or your boundaries.  \nThat wont change.", "That just says that he needs to think about his relationship with his wife.\n\nGet him the help he needs through the proper channels. \n\nBut are you really going to risk your son, just for that?\n\nIf I were you, I'd avoid all physical contact. Stick to phone calls and texts.", "Not unreasonable at all! Autoimmune diseases are no joke and after Covid... Well, doubly so. Perfect clear cut boundaries. NTA", "Not unreasonable. I\u2019m sorry for the hurt your father is inflicting on you. He can visit you in your home alone or not at all. His choice.", "I really wanted it to change but I\u2019m starting to think it won\u2019t", "I will never risk my son, I\u2019ve already told my dad I need space and won\u2019t be seeing him and I plan to have a conversation with him after the holidays so my sister can have a good holiday with him because we had already decided before baby was born we weren\u2019t attending holidays because he wasn\u2019t going to have his vaccinations yet, so for my sisters sake I\u2019m going to wait to drop the bomb about her being cut off and him on his way there if he doesn\u2019t shape up. I wish I could get him help but he\u2019s a grown man, I can\u2019t tell him what to do, I\u2019ve tried to make him see the things every one else sees but at the same time, if he\u2019s happy and he says he is even though no one believes it, I can\u2019t get in the way of that, I can only distance myself from it. It also doesn\u2019t help that being a child of divorce whenever you don\u2019t get along with the parents partner people just assume it\u2019s because you still upset about your parents not being together or things along those lines and it\u2019s never been like that, me and my sister wanted our dad to find someone and be happy, we want our mom to find someone too and we\u2019re also thankful that our parents waited until we were adults to start dating and that they stayed friends, things were ALOT better after they split and we were all better for it", "That\u2019s how it\u2019s been, he\u2019s only been allowed to come see the baby alone at my house, that was the first time she met the baby. And every time he came to the house he wore a mask because he was afraid and wanted to be careful, that\u2019s why his part in this surprises me so much because he was so careful, I never even made him wear the mask, he chose to, except for that day with the both of them", "Just let your dad see his grand kid.  She is not the grandmother, she doesn\u2019t get a vote.  If he doesn\u2019t agree then he doesn\u2019t get access either.  Maybe in a few years she can join in a public setting.  The go from there", "NTA. If she'd put your baby's life at risk then why would you be around her? Idc who it is. She obviously wants to push your buttons and now that she has its your turn to go thru with the consequences. She did it on purpose, screw her.", "NTA no second chances.. they literally knowingly broke everything right away.  \n\n\n>i go over our rules with germs and everything once again and explain if these are broken there are no second chances\n\nI swear.. they knew she works with kids and gets sick often SO WHAT DO THEY WANT.. to meet your unvaccinated infant. I would feel different if your child already had vaccines.. but since they dont.. They dont care about your safety and they dont care about your childs safety.", "I think you can just invite your dad as long as he follows your rules. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason to really include her. It doesn\u2019t seem like she adds anything family wise anyway. \nIf anybody questions, your reasoning, explain to them again that you refuse to bury another child. She had her chance and she shit and pissed all over it. You are not obligated to keep feeding her chances.  NTA", "If they can't perform basic respect then they can piss off. Sometimes you have to cut your family off for your own sanity.", "I\u2019m confused. Was she showing symptoms? \n\nOr are they only allowed around a baby if they\u2019ve quarantined away from other people for a specific period of time?", "NTA\nTell your dad. If your child gets sick, all bills will be sent to him. If this child dies, so does he. (Obviously not literally but in your heart and life). What he pulled, because he knew all this and let it happen. Is the one at fault.", "Your son and your health come first. She has already demonstrated so many times that she doesn\u2019t care about your boundaries or your health so eliminate that germ from your life. Your dad should have been on your side and made certain that his wife understood the boundaries. He didn\u2019t do that. I would go no contact with her and low contact with your dad. For right now, tell both of them that you don\u2019t want to see either one for the foreseeable future.", "So in late 2020, I told my mom that I was uncomfortable with her hanging out with my son any longer if she didn't want to get vaccinated or be cautious about covid(wearing a mask,etc). I was hoping it would make her realize that my son was more important than her ideals. The next day, she packed up all his stuff she had for him and told me to come grab it. A few weeks later, her boyfriend was hospitalized with covid pneumonia from one of the anti-mask protests he and she were going to. \n\nNTA. Only your child's safety matters,you keep being the best parent you can be and ignore the rest. I wish you and your baby nothing but the best.", "[removed]", "NTA \n\nDon't let this entitled witch within a mile of your kid. If your dad doesn't like it, tough.", "NTA your dad can see his grandchild without the woman he married \ud83d\udc85", "I mean your dad married her why would you assume he\u2019s different from her?\n\nYou should\u2019ve gone no contact after she disrespected you several times during your pregnancy. At least do so now", "It\u2019s funny you say that because I did exactly that when I was pregnant the first time I cut her out lol . I wrote my dad a letter and me and my sister met him at my therapists and spent two hours talking to him about all the issues and how we felt and he had completely understood and felt awful about how we felt and things changed for the last few weeks of my pregnancy where she wasn\u2019t allowed around and after the baby was born, just my dad was allowed and then he started asking if there was any way we could work through things and she could meet the baby, I did tell him I believe she does these things deliberately and she makes it pretty obvious she does and I told him I believe shes undiagnosed something and she should really get some help. I think the whole reason she started working with kids is because her therapist probably recommended it. This particular situation was definitely deliberate, she made that clear, I also unfortunately think my dad purposely withheld the information for her, though he denies it. I gave her this last chance for his sake and she literally threw it down the drain so he can\u2019t blame me for this, I tried", "That\u2019s how I feel too, but he definitely has to earn my trust back first, me and my fianc\u00e9 told him we needed some space and are going to focus on our son and wait until he gets his vaccines after the holidays before we consider him visiting again", "I couldn\u2019t agree more", "I would feel different too if he had his vaccines, it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal, it\u2019s the audacity of the whole thing, the whole visit that day was nothing but audacity and I\u2019m really just over it, I\u2019m over trying and having her be manipulative and disrespect me on purpose and my dad making excuses for her saying it\u2019s just a misunderstanding, it\u2019s exhausting and disappointing and frustrating", "Thank you, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve wanted to do all along but I allowed myself to be guilted into giving her a chance and pressured to keep the peace for my dads sake, I also don\u2019t want to hurt him and I know it will hurt him but really she\u2019s the one causing it. He will have to just accept it for what it is now, he can\u2019t blame me for this", "That\u2019s exactly what my fianc\u00e9 said, it sucks but if it has to be done it has to be done", "It\u2019s more so the fact I was told ahead of time that she started volunteering in the school so that I could decide whether I wanted my son exposed to that or not, which I wouldn\u2019t, I would\u2019ve told them they could\u2019ve waited until after the holidays when gets his vaccines. They purposely didn\u2019t tell me so that she could meet the baby. They disregarded his health and safety regardless if she had symptoms, she\u2019s exposed to multiple sicknesses weekly and I deserved to know this information beforehand since it affects my baby. I understand that most people don\u2019t see the big deal if she wasn\u2019t having symptoms but it\u2019s more than that, she did this as a power move against me, she\u2019s caused so many issues throughout my whole pregnancy and she knows what I\u2019ve been through, she knows I\u2019ve already had to bury a son, I\u2019ve lost multiple babies after that and had a hard time conceiving and had to go through fertility treatments and she knows I have auto immune conditions and she knows me and fianc\u00e9 are worried our son will inherit them, so we are a little more careful than most people would be and a little more strict, but most people would understand where we are coming from and respect that and give a little heads up with information like working with kids, the issue is the audacity and blatant disrespect and this was just the last straw for me, I will not risk my son", "I pretty much told him that, I told him I won\u2019t bury another baby and if he ends up sick and in the hospital or god forbid worse, I will never speak to him again and that it will be their fault for being so selfish", "Pretty much what we\u2019re doing. He had respected them at first and he had assured me if I agreed to give his wife another chance that he would make sure she respected them and followed them, he didn\u2019t so now that\u2019s done and over with.

Maybe he\u2019ll be fine. But why take the risk? Any sane, reasonable person will understand that. I would cut my arm off before willingly putting a baby at risk?

Maybe some day if she works on herself and stops being how she is and causing issues but I don\u2019t have high hopes for her, I never really did. Time will tell if my dad will respect my wishes. I will never put my son at risk and I feel terrible that allowed this to even happen because I should\u2019ve known better than to give her a chance.
