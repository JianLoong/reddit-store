He wants you to cook, AND he wants to tell you what to cook and how often? Just... no. \n\nAt our house, if someone's cooking, they get to decide what to make because they're the ones putting in the time and effort. Of course, if I want to do something nice, I'll field requests, but sometimes I don't want to cook and I'm it, so I have to. In that case, I'll feed people, but it might be eggs and toast or something else super easy. \n\nAfter 20 years of making people food, I'm so tired of it.
