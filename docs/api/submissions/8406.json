When we both work, I usually sleep most of the time he is at work and vice-versa.\n\nHe doesn't seem to like the idea of me making large dishes to eat throughout the week on my days off, but instead wants me to cook something fresh every day he works. This would be fine, but I inevitably end up working the same days as him at certain points. Despite the fact that I also am working, he wants me to cook something fresh for us before I go to work or after getting home.\n\nI wouldn't be against this if it were easy meals that he was wanting, like a frozen pizza or something, but we're talking like actual full meals with a main dish and sides. Frankly, I think it's kind of ridiculous, especially considering I don't expect him to really cook for me at all. I'm fine making/getting my own food.\n\nNot to mention the fact that as of recently I no longer have a car, and am riding an electric bicycle to work 7 miles to and from each day that our shifts overlap. I'm not in the best of shape, and while I actually do enjoy biking, I don't want to bike a total of 14 miles and work an 8 hour manual labor shift, just to come home and cook a full meal before going to sleep and doing it all over again.\n\nI've voiced my concerns to him, but he doesn't seem to understand why I am upset about this, and recites the fact that he works more than I do, so I should be willing since I have so much free time compared to him.\n\nI make this post because I'm genuinely unsure if I'm being lazy or he is expecting too much from me.

If he wants fresh cooked food everyday then he can cook himself.\n\nEven if he does other things in the house etc this is not a fair request.", "Hang on, with that schedule, he works a total of 15 shifts in 4 weeks am I right?\n\nwouldn't that be a total of 180 hours or an average of 45 hours a week? i.e. he's not working *that* much more than you overall.\n\nHe doesn't get to decide that you have to cook fresh meals for him daily *anyway* but if your average difference in working hours is a whopping 5 hours a week it's even worse.\n\nwhat does he do around the house/for the household economy, that he thinks having a personal chef is a fair trade?\n\nNTA", "NTA - Why dont you ask him what he would do if you weren't around anymore to cook for him? Would he just starve to death and die? This is a grown ass man. If he wants a freshly cooked meal then he can easily make it himself its really not hard at all.   \nSounds like you guys need to research crockpot recipes or learn how to prep when you get groceries so either of you can just throw some chicken and veggies in the oven and walk away for 30 mins and come back to a delicious hot meal.", "YTA to yourself for not leaving his ass", "Ugh. He wants you to cook, AND he wants to tell you what to cook and how often? Just... no. \n\nAt our house, if someone's cooking, they get to decide what to make because they're the ones putting in the time and effort. Of course, if I want to do something nice, I'll field requests, but sometimes I don't want to cook and I'm it, so I have to. In that case, I'll feed people, but it might be eggs and toast or something else super easy. \n\nAfter 20 years of making people food, I'm so tired of it. So now we share the task, and I'm just happy to be fed. If someone doesn't like what's for supper, they can always make a sandwich instead. \n\nYou have the right to negotiate the division of chores in your own household, and you get a say. What's fair isn't always about exact hours of work, but also about what you can live with doing over and over again. Life is a marathon, not a sprint, and exhausting yourself cooking overly complicated meals takes away from other things. Only you can know how much is too much for you, and your partner should respect your limits and be contributing, too.", "NTA\n\nI'm the main cook of my household. I don't make fresh meals every day. Sometimes I do, but when I decide on a dish that WILL have ample leftovers, no one complains. They're just grateful I cook because they have too much chronic pain to handle standing in the kitchen for 1-2 hours.\n\nIf he wants fresh meals every single day, then he can do it. If he decides his time outside work is too \"precious\" to do that but you're isn't, then I advise you not give him a choice and search for greener pastures. You're his boyfriend, not his personal chef.", "NTA.  Cooking a full meal fresh every day is fine if the cook wants to do it, but it's a ridiculous thing to require even if you didn't work at all.  You both work full time, so regardless of his longer hours, he should be doing half the total chores - among cooking, cleaning, shopping, everything.", "Info: how are the other household chores split?", "NTA your boyfriend is a grown man. He can cook for himself or buy himself food", "NTA\n\nExpecting a full meal every day, and not accepting a frozen pizza or prepped soup is a very 1950's husband move. A full fresh meals with side dishes every day is an unreasonable expectation for anyone other than a private chef. Also I don't know what the hell he is talking about him working more than you do and you having, \"so much free time compared to him,\" when he works 42 hours a week on average, and you work 40. Plus you are working nights, which is so much harder on your body and mind. It seems like the other chores are split evenly, you're working about the same amount, so it makes no sense for him to demand such meals. You two need to have a serious talk because you are not on the same page on what the workload is, and how it's being shared because he is not seeing the amount of work that you put in both at home and at work.", "Hang on, how does he work more than you? \n\nBe careful what precedent you set. His expectations are unreasonable. \n\nDude needs to learn to cook for himself. NTA", "He is TAH! If you are cooking then you do it the way it works for you. If he wants to cook he gets to do it his own way. \n\nDoes he ever cook? Your hours seem about equal his days might be longer but he gets more days off?", "NTA Cooking takes time and energy, you're both working and I don't think it's fair to expect someone to have dinner ready for you. I mean if he wants meals, why not try cooking together sometime? That way you both get to eat a good meal and get to spend some quality time together. Not sure why he didn't ask that instead of demanding food.", "NTA but it sounds like your boyfriend sure is. Why are you supposed to cook for him again?", "NTA, the person cooking decides what they are making, you're not a restaurant,  that's if YOU decided to cook that evening.", "NTA \nUnless he is paying more rent, chores are supposed to be divided equally. \nIf your thing is meal prepping he can either decide to eat that too or cook his own food.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Besides that, have a discussion about it. Maybe some days a 'real' meal can be prepared while other times you cook the larger meal for the subsequent leftovers.

If you do dishes and laundry and cook? He better be doing almost everything else like vacuum, yard work, clean bathrooms etc. Even my dad who is way old school with \"women's work\" attitude would cook meals on occasion for the family usually every Sunday and on a few other occasions as well. But if he does ALL the cleaning and what not then and only then would it be y, t, a", "NTA. He is expecting too much of you. Next, he'll expect the toilet to be cleaned every day while he is gone, and please vacuum the whole house. When he is home, these things aren't necessary of course. 8 hours of manual labor plus a 14 mile bike ride are tiring. You shouldn't have an elaborate third shift because the man wishes fresh food. You should probably mealprep together so that both of you can assemble a fresh and healthy meal within 10 minutes.", "NTA\n\nI'm a shift worker.  I know nobody that makes meals every day or expects their partner to make meals for them every day.  I make my meals or have them ready (frozen pizza at least once a week for me....love me some pizza) for the duration of my shift the day before I start it.  I do 4 on 4 off rotating (days and nights) 12 hr shifts.  Everyone where I work either has their food ready for the 4 shifts or pick up something on the way in if they didn't have something prepared in advance.

No. I was doing the same thing a couple of years ago and there\u2019s no way in hell I would make a fresh meal everyday. If he wants you to prepare a full meal everyday you need to be the stay at home partner so that your job is the up keep of the house. You\u2019ve made a compromise where you make a couple of meals and reheat. Cooking is hard work and I doubt he\u2019s going to help with the clean up. Where\u2019s time for you in all this. You are not his house keeper, you are his partner in every way including a bread winner. Tell him to cook his own meals if he doesn\u2019t want to take your compromise.
