And since business is business there is no need to be salty, I will just say I don't have money available when they ask. They are short on just $115 from last time that I will ask them to return later today. Although being open and telling them how I fell would be better, the burden to open up is too great for someone that prefers to avoid conflicts as I do.

If it's your business, can't you stop \"them\" displaying the card?", "Yes, and I'd say it BEFORE they ask for money. Saying it when they do could be perceived as vindictive and they might talk behind your back but giving them a heads up that that's how you feel is completely reasonable.", "Lovely delivery.", "The coffee store co-owner set it on their own counter and where people sit to eat.

They are displaying it on their store, on their counter and tables. I saw it causa when I arrived at work because I went in their store to say good morning as I do everyday. That's why I think I would be an asshole as I'm not entitled to their business space.", "Oh, I guess they're free to place advertisements in their coffee shop. However, I would probably stop giving loans to people that actively promote a competitor of yours. I wouldn't make a big problem over it, but it's pretty reasonable to expect a favor for favor. If they had to place someone's advertisement in there then maybe they could've used yours as an appreciation for your willingness to help with their finances.", "Your original post said that the competitors' cards were on display in *your* store:\n\n> I am a small business owner and have a small store that sell cellphone cases. Today when I arrived at work I saw they were displaying one of my competitors business card\n\nThis isn't making much sense. Are you trying to say that you arrived at your store and a nearby coffee shop was displaying the competitors' cards?", "You are not entitled to their business space or free advertising.  \n\nThey are also not entitled to your loans.  \n\nI'd tell them this-  'I can't order you to promote my store or not promote theirs.  However, I thought we had a friendly informal alliance of basic mutual interest- when my store does well I can afford to lend you money, when your store does well you can afford to pay me back.  That, to me, makes us basic allies of mutual interest- you want me to succeed, I want you to succeed.  \nWhen you promote my competition, that's sending business to them instead of me, they succeed and I don't.  Maybe you get more benefit from them than you do from me, that's just business and I understand you gotta do what's right for your business, no hard feelings.  But I'm not going to help a shop that helps my competition, that's counterproductive for me.  That's just business, and I hope you understand.  \nAs of today, I've loaned you $x.  If we aren't allies going forward, then I'll be needing that to be paid back soon, at least $x/month until we're even, because I may need the money soon to compete with this new store.  \nI don't need a decision right this second, but soon.  And whether our companies are allied or not, I still consider you a friend.  Let me know what you decide soon, okay?'

So when OP came to work in the morning and went to say good morning to their friends as they do every day, they noticed the coffee shop was advertising the competitor in the shop (counters and tables) and asked the coffee shop owner about it.", "I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s strings attached. OP loaned them money in good faith because they\u2019re friends and OP wants to support their friends who are struggling right now, and the money is coming from OP\u2019s business. So for them to advertise a competitor a) shows they don\u2019t care about OP\u2019s business which is not something you should do to a friend and b) they want to have their cake and eat it too, take money from OP\u2019s business and take money from the competitor.  \n\nI would cut the money too because it\u2019s clear those people don\u2019t see OP as a friend since friends don\u2019t do that to each other.
