Ian has a fianc\u00e9 named Tara (24 female). Me and Tara do not get along at all. I hate her personality and the way she is overall. Tara is the type to think her opinion just needs to be said even if the situation is bad. She is the type to think everything is about her. And she is very demanding. She\u2019s very irresponsible with their money which Ian turns a complete blind eye to. Not many people in the family like her.\n\nI have five other kids other than Ian. Ian, Vivian(15 female), Lucas (11 male) and my 6 year old triplets. Ian and Tara decided to make their wedding child free which is their decision and I\u2019m not complaining about that. But it also excludes Vivian who turns 16 before their wedding. I found that to be rather absurd because normally child free weddings excludes young kids. Not 16 year olds. I can get Lucas because he hates events like this and I know he won\u2019t sit sit but Vivian is a very well behaved child. She loves weddings and Ian knows this.\n\nI asked Ian about this because I know asking Tara would only bring issues. Ian said it wasn\u2019t his decision but Tara\u2019s decision. So I ended up speaking to Tara and she specifically said she doesn\u2019t know Vivian all that well and that she doesn\u2019t want strangers at her wedding. I can totally get it if it\u2019s a friend\u2019s partner you haven\u2019t met yet but this your soon to be husband\u2019s little sister not a stranger. They\u2019ve met plenty of times before but they aren\u2019t like close.\n\nI didn\u2019t argue but did tell the both of them I wouldn\u2019t be attending anymore because this situation was unfair and cruel to Vivian who thought she would be attending her brother\u2019s wedding. Not to mention there are other teenagers Vivian\u2019s age who is attending the wedding. Tara called me cruel for not wanting to attend my own son\u2019s wedding. I told her she was cruel for not wanting to invite her fianc\u00e9\u2019s sister to their wedding. She said \u201cher wedding, her choice\u201d. So AITA?\n\nEdit: Vivian is a rather quiet person. She has spoken to Tara before but she is very much introverted so there has never been full conversations between the both of them. Vivian does interact much around people she isn\u2019t comfortable with which includes Tara.\n\nAlso other than my relationship with Tara Vivian has a very good relationship with Ian so this came as a shock and a good relationship with Tara. There has never been an issue between them.", "created_utc": 1679004848, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11t80xa/aita_for_telling_my_son_i_am_not_attending_his/", "score": 186, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Tara is making the wedding only about her. She's excluding anyone she doesn't know well... even if your son does.\n\nThis is such a huge Red Flag about how their marriage are gonna be. No wonder you don't like her very much.\n\n__________\n\nSecond. People are free to exclude whoever they want from their wedding, they also have the right to demand whatever they want from the guests. No children, 20000 dollars gifts, everyone wears blue hats. They have this right.\n\nBut then people are also free to refuse to attend the wedding. They can't make demands of people, and expect everyone will be OK with them.\n\nGetting mad at people refusing to attend a wedding because of the demands, is shittier than people getting mad at the demands itself.", "Nta.

Does he have no spine?

I guarantee if she was excluded from holiday events/family gatherings she would be pissed, rightfully so.", "NTA. It seems a little personal, probably has something to do with you two not getting along. Now she doesn't have to worry about you being there and she has some ammo to use against you with Ian.

This was always gonna be at least a small YWBTA, but her saying his sister is a stranger is just too much...", "NTA how can you make a wedding without calling the siblings of one side (husband's) just because the wife wants it 'childfree' lol that makes 0 sense. This woman is dangerous and she will keep away Ian from everyone I'm sure of it, she will be very manipulative. It already has began, your son turned into her puppet. Prepare to live hard times with that woman. She called her partner's siblings (and soon her in law siblings) 'strangers' wow what an AH. Don't go to that circus wedding.", "If they want to be rigid and unreasonable, then you can be too!

Maybe Tara\u2019s family pressured her about her own younger family members being there. Maybe her own family didn\u2019t like the adults only rule. Who knows. Maybe there\u2019s limitations on the amount of heads allowed. Who knows. Who is flipping the bill for the wedding? Communication would help there\u2019s not a lot of information provided. It\u2019s Al\u2019s on possibility that this is Ian passing the buck and possibly using Tara as his out. There is a possibility that Ian\u2019s family isn\u2019t necessarily ideal I\u2019m either maybe there is a reason behind this. We don\u2019t know. We can only assume based on the title information op has provided.   My post may have been downvoted but I merely pointed out op is an AH for the fact that her decision could ultimately destroy her relationship with her son. If she\u2019s down with that it should be no issue. Just because that\u2019s something somebody doesn\u2019t want to hear doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s being said to hurt anybody and it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a huge possibility.  Either way there needs to be more communication and not just leaving Ian to use Tara as his out. There needs to be more of a direct line of communication with Tara herself if she\u2019s intended to be part of the family. That part is worrisome.", "That doesn't make OP NTA, that just makes the daughter in law also an asshole. She should retain the moral high ground. I think people are confusing being justified as an asshole with not being an asshole", "Right?  The fact that the bride is completely ok with inviting her own siblings (ages 12-18), but refuses to allow her groom-to-be\u2019s sister (age 16 by the wedding) is the height of hypocrisy!   \nHow can she NOT see that she wants to play by one set of rules, but expects her groom/his family to play by another?  She seems to have low emotional intelligence or this is just about control.", "Right. I suspect Tara doesn\u2019t want OP to come, but wants it to be OPs choice. Vivian is just collateral damage.", "There are four that are her age but the others are ages 12-18.", "YES! but the couple NOT the grooms mothers perception of the bride. ( or vice versa ) \n\nMy MIL doesnt like me much  because her son stopped drinking with my help, she loved the  fact that he still relied on her. Doesnt makes me terrible even though she thinks I am.", "It will because I\u2019m going to spend time with her on that day and try and take her mind off it.", "Yet the bride has her teenage cousins as guests yet her future 16 year old sister in law can\u2019t come? Read OPs comments. She\u2019s NTA. Her STB DIL sounds like a nightmare.", "No there not when you call a kettle a kettle you\u2019re just not an AH.\nWhen you call out bad behaviour you\u2019re not an AH.\nWhen you refuse to enable said behaviour you\u2019re not an AH.\nThat\u2019s why In this case OPs NTA the brides a massive AH and the groom is either a massive AH too or just being played by a younger woman.", "Oh, absolutely NTA", "She's not just bridezilla, she's mechabridezilla", "Yeah because helping a man stop drinking and isolating him from his entire family are the same thing aren\u2019t they? \nJust because OPs a MIL doesn\u2019t automatically mean the DIL is the blameless party. Yeah there are terrible MILs out there but not all of them are like that. And just because the DIL is a DIL she\u2019s somehow the innocent party here. \nGet your head on straight", "Or, hear me out here, she is actively trying to separate her future husband from his whole family. \n\nThat's not bridezilla, that's controlling and I wonder if she's financially abusive. (Being bad with money could go either way)", "Um, my head is well and truly on straight. I did not insult you please give me the same respect. \n\nMy point is that weddings are not always a family affair. The couple make the decisions and the family need to respect them, I didnt ever say the DIL is completely blameless ( or even right ) but she's still the bride, she's still the priority.", "No. There\u2019s no excuse here. Bride\u2019s teenage siblings and cousins can attend, but the groom\u2019s teenage sister can\u2019t? \nGroom is getting married here too and should have a say. He should be standing up to her which makes him TA as well.", "How am I making excuses? \n\nBecause we are getting the story from the groom's mum we dont know the whole story, if the couple have chosen to have her teenage siblings there and not his then that is their decision and they have to live with whatever consequences it brings. Right or wrong, if is their decision."]}
