{"id": 12476, "submission_id": "11t80xa", "title": "AITA for telling my son I am not attending his wedding anymore", "selftext": "All fake names\n\nI(39 female) have a 24 year old son named Ian (I know I had him young don\u2019t comment on this). Ian has a fianc\u00e9 named Tara (24 female). Me and Tara do not get along at all. I hate her personality and the way she is overall. Tara is the type to think her opinion just needs to be said even if the situation is bad. She is the type to think everything is about her. And she is very demanding. She\u2019s very irresponsible with their money which Ian turns a complete blind eye to. Not many people in the family like her.\n\nI have five other kids other than Ian. Ian, Vivian(15 female), Lucas (11 male) and my 6 year old triplets. Ian and Tara decided to make their wedding child free which is their decision and I\u2019m not complaining about that. But it also excludes Vivian who turns 16 before their wedding. I found that to be rather absurd because normally child free weddings excludes young kids. Not 16 year olds. I can get Lucas because he hates events like this and I know he won\u2019t sit sit but Vivian is a very well behaved child. She loves weddings and Ian knows this.\n\nI asked Ian about this because I know asking Tara would only bring issues. Ian said it wasn\u2019t his decision but Tara\u2019s decision. So I ended up speaking to Tara and she specifically said she doesn\u2019t know Vivian all that well and that she doesn\u2019t want strangers at her wedding. I can totally get it if it\u2019s a friend\u2019s partner you haven\u2019t met yet but this your soon to be husband\u2019s little sister not a stranger. They\u2019ve met plenty of times before but they aren\u2019t like close.\n\nI didn\u2019t argue but did tell the both of them I wouldn\u2019t be attending anymore because this situation was unfair and cruel to Vivian who thought she would be attending her brother\u2019s wedding. Not to mention there are other teenagers Vivian\u2019s age who is attending the wedding. Tara called me cruel for not wanting to attend my own son\u2019s wedding. I told her she was cruel for not wanting to invite her fianc\u00e9\u2019s sister to their wedding. She said \u201cher wedding, her choice\u201d. So AITA?\n\nEdit: Vivian is a rather quiet person. She has spoken to Tara before but she is very much introverted so there has never been full conversations between the both of them. Vivian does interact much around people she isn\u2019t comfortable with which includes Tara.\n\nAlso other than my relationship with Tara Vivian has a very good relationship with Ian so this came as a shock and a good relationship with Tara. There has never been an issue between them.", "created_utc": 1679004848, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11t80xa/aita_for_telling_my_son_i_am_not_attending_his/", "score": 1124, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

People are free to exclude whoever they want from their wedding, they also have the right to demand whatever they want from the guests. No children, 20000 dollars gifts, everyone wears blue hats. They have this right.\n\nBut then people are also free to refuse to attend the wedding. They can't make demands of people, and expect everyone will be OK with them.\n\nGetting mad at people refusing to attend a wedding because of the demands, is shittier than people getting mad at the demands itself.", "Nta.

Does he have no spine?

This was always gonna be at least a small YWBTA, but her saying his sister is a stranger is just too much...", "NTA how can you make a wedding without calling the siblings of one side (husband's) just because the wife wants it 'childfree' lol that makes 0 sense. This woman is dangerous and she will keep away Ian from everyone I'm sure of it, she will be very manipulative. It already has began, your son turned into her puppet.

Don't go to that circus wedding.", "If they want to be rigid and unreasonable, then you can be too!

If he doesn\u2019t care or respect his own sister/family why should she?", "NTA\nThey made their choice, you respected it, now they need to respect yours.

Honestly, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever actually even been invited to a child free wedding. The closest I\u2019ve ever come was a good friends wedding where only the reception was child free. The ceremony was not. It actually worked out perfectly because my daughter was a flower girl and my dear friend really wanted my mom to also come to the wedding. We all attended the ceremony, and then my mom (who doesn\u2019t drink or stay up late) took my kids home with her and I attended the reception.", "The son should prepare himself not to be allowed to see his \"siblings\" anymore because his soon-to-be wife doesn't want that because they are \"strangers\" with whom she doesn't want anything to do. He doesn't see them as family either, otherwise he would take his dog's leash off and tell his fiancee that her 16-year-old relatives shouldn't be allowed to come either.", "So...OP's TA because she's offended her future DIL purposely excluded her daughter from the wedding with rules that suddenly don't apply if it's her own siblings and cousins? And with her son just going \"well that's what she wants\"? And she's still expected to attend the marriage of these two dicks who insulted her and her family?", "I\u2019m gonna start saying grow a snipe", "So it\u2019s not a rule? She is just not inviting his siblings? That is a key point. \n\nDefinitely NTa", "My eldest brother had a (mostly) child free wedding. The only children there? The flower girls, ring bearer, and poor 15 year old me who barely knew anyone lmao. Still, my SIL had the decency to invite me, unlike the posts one", "Maybe it won't make her less sad about not being invited, but at least she'll know her mother has her back.", "that\u2019s not what femdom is. femdom is a sexual thing where a woman takes on the dominant role in sex. this just sounds like abuse", "So what does she/he say when you point out that others are going that are younger? \n\nBc it\u2019s clearly not a rule - she is just not inviting his sibling", "And that\u2019s fine but op must also realize she may lose contact with her son.  Just because it\u2019s something she may not want to hear doesn\u2019t meant it might not occur.  Also it seems like alot of information is being omitted and I don\u2019t think OP is entirely innocent with her own attitude and misgivings based on her reactions with not hearing something sugarcoated. Everybody is an AH in this situation and everybody seems to be hurt and acting out.   They\u2019re better off getting a court house marriage to avoid this drama.", "I kept trying to look for this edit and I don\u2019t see it. Where is it mentioned?", "Yeah, definitely. Unless Tara is (in public) dressing in latex and stepping on Ian\u2019s balls it\u2019s probably not a femdom thing.", "In OP's comments.", "Oh no wonder I didn\u2019t see that I didn\u2019t see her comments I only read her main post. I didn\u2019t skower other peoples comments. I kept going back to see if she had edited it in. Thank you for clarifying."]}
