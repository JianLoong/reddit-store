It\u2019s not my day to day job, but I do some catering on the side for extra money sometimes. One of my closest friends is getting married this summer and I am super excited for her wedding. \n\nShe told me recently that she wanted to use me for catering for the wedding. I told her I was honored that she thought I was a good enough cook, but if I provided catering, I wouldn\u2019t be able to really enjoy the wedding as a guest and I hadn\u2019t really been planning on working all day for my friend\u2019s wedding. She told me that providing the catering could be my wedding gift instead of an actual gift. I explained that if I was catering the wedding (it\u2019s 40/50 people so small for a wedding, but still obviously a lot of cooking and prep) that I couldn\u2019t attend it because I\u2019d be making Hors D\u2019oeuvre during the day and ceremony and dinner during the reception. So if I\u2019m not attending the wedding, I didn\u2019t owe her an expensive gift so she needed to pay me if she wanted me to cater. She is now mad at me because she was trying to help boost my catering by giving me some exposure (again, this is not my main source of income and I\u2019m not looking for new clients). I feel bad that she is mad at me but I just don\u2019t see why i should cater meals and appetizers for free for her just because I am a good cook! It would be extremely expensive and super time consuming for me.
