Here's the back story...We never really have but it's been 1000 times worse since I let her & her 2 kids move in with me 8 years ago. It was only for 1 year but our relationship went even more downhill during that time. \n\nShe's a bit of a narcissist & when my daughter (4) was 6 months old, we found out she had tumors on her liver. We didn't know yet if it was benign or cancerous. \n\nDuring this time my sister called to talk to me about our relationship, which I thought had been going pretty dang well. We spoke to each other & saw each other more often since my daughter was born and I thought it was so great. My daughter seemed to bring us closer. \n\nDuring this convo though, she wanted to know why I treated her the way I did and she was tired of the way I was treating her, and blood is thicker than water (and so much more). \n\nI told her what was going on with my daughter and I really didn't have the capacity to go through this with her at the moment. She said, \"I'm really sorry to hear that but you've been acting this way for years.\" I was truly floored since I thought things were going so well between us. At this comment though, I entirely lost my patience.\n\nI told her I could not handle this with her again (she goes through cycles with this), that we weren't close, and never will be close but I was going to focus on my daughter who may or may not have a cancerous tumor (thankfully, we found out later it was benign).\n\nShe said all kinds of things to that through very long, elaborate texts and said she did not want me to be in her life. \n\nFine. In the time frame between then and now, we've been civil. I text her on her birthday & Christmas and when I have to talk to her about spending time with my niece (18) & nephew (13). She doesn't text or call at all. Then I got pregnant with my 2nd & had him 2 months ago. \n\nShe never calls my daughter or even texts to ask about her. So, I didn't tell her I was pregnant or when he was born but my mom told her. Mom also told me that my sister was upset because I didn't let her know about the pregnancy but especially his birth. I told my mom that's her own fault for 1 telling me she didn't want me in her life & 2 for not even trying to have a relationship with her niece just because she was angry with me. \n\nI still can't help but feel some guilt here though.
