Here's the back story...We never really have but it's been 1000 times worse since I let her & her 2 kids move in with me 8 years ago. It was only for 1 year but our relationship went even more downhill during that time. \n\nShe's a bit of a narcissist & when my daughter (4) was 6 months old, we found out she had tumors on her liver. We didn't know yet if it was benign or cancerous. \n\nDuring this time my sister called to talk to me about our relationship, which I thought had been going pretty dang well. We spoke to each other & saw each other more often since my daughter was born and I thought it was so great. My daughter seemed to bring us closer. \n\nDuring this convo though, she wanted to know why I treated her the way I did and she was tired of the way I was treating her, and blood is thicker than water (and so much more). \n\nI told her what was going on with my daughter and I really didn't have the capacity to go through this with her at the moment. She said, \"I'm really sorry to hear that but you've been acting this way for years.\" I was truly floored since I thought things were going so well between us. At this comment though, I entirely lost my patience.\n\nI told her I could not handle this with her again (she goes through cycles with this), that we weren't close, and never will be close but I was going to focus on my daughter who may or may not have a cancerous tumor (thankfully, we found out later it was benign).\n\nShe said all kinds of things to that through very long, elaborate texts and said she did not want me to be in her life. \n\nFine. In the time frame between then and now, we've been civil. I text her on her birthday & Christmas and when I have to talk to her about spending time with my niece (18) & nephew (13). She doesn't text or call at all. Then I got pregnant with my 2nd & had him 2 months ago. \n\nShe never calls my daughter or even texts to ask about her. So, I didn't tell her I was pregnant or when he was born but my mom told her. Mom also told me that my sister was upset because I didn't let her know about the pregnancy but especially his birth. I told my mom that's her own fault for 1 telling me she didn't want me in her life & 2 for not even trying to have a relationship with her niece just because she was angry with me. \n\nI still can't help but feel some guilt here though.

Every single time she said that I ask the same question. Her response is always the same, \"I'm tired of telling you. You should know by now.\"", "NTA\n\n\"Blood of the covenant is thicker than water of the womb\" is the full phrase. \n\nI.e. the bonds and relationships you make are worth more than family, you don't owe your family\"just because they are family\" \n\nYour sister sounds bipolar, mental. She's swings and roundabouts. Sounds like her emotions and therefore her thoughts flip flop with a gust of wind on any given day. Which would be exhausting to deal with. \n\nAdd that on top of your situation you were dealing with, she's all \"me, me, me\" main character syndrome. Not everything is about her! \n\nShe wanted you out of her life, you did it. She did it. You check in with her, she doesn't check in with you. You check with her kids, she ignores your existence. If she wasn't family you'd never have to hear about this again, so my guess is she's hurt or embarrassed and feels called out in front of other family, she's redirected her emotions to anger towards you instead of dealing with the root of the issue. \n\nShe caused this situation, and she doesn't want to be blamed..she wants you to be at fault. Fuck that noise! \n\nI'd continue on with my life and go no contact with her. You haven't had any form of relationship or contact with her in years, even when you reach out, she doesn't reply.

I just chose not to be stuck with them", "OP, the only people who have the right to demand your attention and expect you to make everything about them are your children, especially your newborn.\n\nThere is no need to have a self-centered person such as your sister bringing you down and wasting your time.

But she didn't say the entire phrase which is the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb? Which seems to mean the exact opposite of what she's trying to make it mean.

My sister told me that she didn't want me in her life or her son's (she weaponizes the kid a lot) but then got angry and upset two years later when \"her son didn't know his aunt\" -- ok...so I started to be involved at our mom's insistence, but it proved to be a bad choice that I now pay the consequences for (formed a relationship with her son at the time we were introduced and next child, and I can't just...abandon them, but children are a package deal with their parents so it's a balancing act I wish I'd never started).", "NTA. Also, her saying \"blood is thicker than water\" is inaccurate. The true saying is \"the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb.\" And it literally means that the bonds and friendships you choose are more important than bonds you had no say in forming. And your sister sounds incredibly draining and self-centered and I would recommend forming bonds that bring you peace and keep out those who bring you chaos and stress.", "NTA-  break those cycles, you can't live going round and round the 'why don't you like me more' train", "NTA, you could not pay me to interact with this person, blood or not.", "Wonder if sis could have bi-polar disorder. The thing about her cycling through periods of antagonism out of the blue stands out to me. \n\nIt happens a lot, people are fine(ish) they enter a manic phase and sometimes that takes the form of paranoia or aggressiveness. They get stuck on an idea, ruminate on it then head down a spiral to get into a frenzy and let loose. Elaborate texts and long non-stopping emotional rants can happen. \n\nIt by no means excuse what she did, but looking up ways to deal with people with bi polar or narcissism might give op some tools on how to deal with her sister if stuff like this happens again to protect her sanity.", "My sister blames me for our relationship being non-existent despite her:\nTrying to drown me in a creek as children\n\nTelling me from my earliest memories that she hated me/wished I'd die/wished I'd never been born\n\nTrying to break my arm\n\nBullying me/having her friends bully me from kindergarten - middle school\n\nTelling me to end my life/encouraging me to/telling me exactly how to do it\n\nTelling me I was a mistake/unloved and that no one wanted me around\n\nDespite that, I still tried to support her emotionally and financially until I hit a breaking point when she told me she'd never loved me, no one would ever love me, my only value is what others could take, and that I was stupid for ever thinking we'd have a relationship.\n\nSome people just suck and blame everyone else for it.\n*ETA: Formatting", "I'm NC with my sister but am allowed to interact with my siblings w/o talking to my sister outside of pickup dropoff.

Is there anyone who might be willing to be a buffer?", "Oh, yes, our mom does that for us but my sister is really dense and thinks she's entitled to a relationship with me because of her children even though I laid it out really clearly on why I don't want that anymore (I tried, sincerely). She, too, likes free babysitting too much but she still has drama flair ups. She's mostly not in my life at this point so it's getting better but she and her partner are really hard people to be around.", "Ugh, that sucks but I get it. The last time I picked my niece up for a visit my sister tried to have a pity party about her weight to the point she said she wished she had cancer so the chemo would make her skinny \ud83d\ude43\n\nI just told her to take some vitamins so she'd have enough energy to be active, grabbed the kiddo, and bailed because wtaf.

Your relative doesn't know the difference, didn't choose to be family, and is now confused why you're not treating them like family.", "NTA. First congratulations on your new born. Second, your sister wants have everything everyway she can. Life is not like that. I have an entitled sister as well, and the reality is they never change or take responsibility for their actions or decisions and always need to play the victim. Your daughter had a tumor, she's the victim cause your not giving the relationship she suddenly wanted to have with you enough attention. She doesn't want a relationship with you, how dare you not tell her about your life. No you shouldn't feel guilty, because the fact that you didn't tell her about your son means you acted from instinct and self preservation.", "Funny enough, her daughter is taking a psychology course in college & told her mom the same thing. That she thinks her mom is bi-polar & a narcissist."]}
