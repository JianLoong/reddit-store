Children are not as fragile as people and many kids who know about it early are proud of being adopted.\n\nInstead you made a lie like her being adopted was shameful, leading to a terrible reaction. You made it seem like you were ashamed of how she came into the family enough to lie for almost 27 years", "YTA \n\nAdoptee here, I've always known I was adopted. There was never a time I remember being \"told\", it always just was a fact. Being adopted is nothing shameful, but you've created stigma and shame around it by hiding it from her and lying to her and your other kids their whole lives.

It\u2019s been the recommended practice SINCE THE 1960s to tell a child from DAY ONE that they\u2019re adopted. That way they grow up always knowing.

They know the broad contours, and as they get more mature, I provide more details in age appropriate ways. There are some details that I don't think they can handle until they're adults (or maybe don't ever need, we'll cross that bridge in a decade). My kids were both adopted as infants from foster care,  and even as grade schoolers, there are parts of their story that they aren't ready for (your birth parents loved you but couldn't take care of you, but there are people whose job it is to give those kids safe and loving homes is basically the current explanation). But ultimately, it's their story, and they deserve to know it", "Honesty is the best policy", "Wow. YTA", "I have to go with YTA. I was adopted as a baby. As soon as I could comprehend and understand, my parents made sure I knew. All my siblings, aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins, etc treated me as family and no issues whatsoever.\n\nYes,  the adoption did happen due to a tragedy.

Maybe not beyond repair, but damaged nonetheless.", "YTA and I don't need context. I can tell by the title alone. There is no excuse for hiding such an important thing from someone.", "YTA. You lied to all of your children for their entire lives. You actively denied your daughter the right to know her father and denied her father the chance to get to know his daughter. There is no defending this kind of action as it was done selfishly. There is no reason to keep this information from her other than to make things easier for yourself. Keeping the massive, life altering secret from her is honestly just lazy and shameful. This would definitely cause me to question if you were trustworthy.

The very fact you think it was a success that she \"never even realized\" she isn't yours biologically is pretty horrifying. It's even worse that you convinced her she and your son were twins, presumably also potentially erasing her own birthday? For god's sake adoption was absolutely not taboo in the 90's, why did you do this? This is something people did 50+ years ago. I really can't understand your thought process with this at all. \n\nYou owe your daughter a massive apology and a lot of groveling. I also strongly suggest you read up on the effects adoption can have on something. You severely betrayed your daughter, and irreparably damaged your relationship with her.

YTA and so is your husband.", "As a birth mom and an adoptive mom.. what the fuck? \n\nYes you are a massive asshole. YTA", "YTA, 100%. As an adoptee who grew up just knowing she was adopted as an inherent fact (i.e. it was never a secret, it was just something I knew, there was not big \u201crevelation\u201d moment), it helped me understand a lot of things about my life and the way I was treated by people and some of my family. Knowing at a very young age helped me be able to form my identity about things I *had* choices in, and not just my adoption. It also helped me understand that families and love come in so many different forms, and that biological relationships aren\u2019t the end-all-be-all.\n\nThere\u2019s so much trauma that can come along with being adopted, and by letting us adoptees have our whole lifetimes to learn to understand with it, live with it, and navigate it throughout our lives is so much better than throwing us into turmoil later on in life where it\u2019s harder to learn the tools to function with the information and not feel so lost. There are also medical reasons for us to know, among many other reasons, and your husband was correct in actually telling her (albeit way too late) especially because you are hinting that her mother struggled with PPD which is important, potentially lifesaving information for Alice during this pregnancy. Stop making excuses. Yes, you raised her, but that\u2019s not an excuse for keeping an extreme secret from her. You didn\u2019t \u201cdo a good job because she never realized.\u201d You can\u2019t pat yourself on the back for that while you actively did her a disservice.

Withholding such fundamental information about who a person is, is wrong on so many levels.\n\nAlso - you raised them as twins?

Someone who if you talk to twins, you're connected to on another level. That deep connection and relationship she's had her entire life was based on a lie. If you're willing to lie about something like that then obviously little lies would mean nothing to you. So what else have you lied to her about? She's questioning her entire existence because of this. It's alot to take in already finding out you're adopted at that age. But then she's got so much else that was just a lie.

She should have been told from day one. Now she has to wonder why it was kept secret", "YTAThis isn't about you not raising her well. I'm sure she was raised well and truly loved. This is about the emotional feelings she is going through right now finding out her whole life and bloodline was a lie. Finding out that not only was she not actually a twin to her brother...but that she was adopted. Unless you have had one or both happen to you, you do not understand.\n\nRegarding the Twin thing: Look being raised as a twin honestly sucks as is. I am a twin btw. A lot of twins, myself included, truly struggle to figure out their own independent personalitys as adults because growing up...we are raised to be each others best friends. It's honestly rough when you start the separating process and are having to learn to be without your twin for the first real times ever. I wouldn't wish twinship on anyone to be honest. A lot of times it builds a heavy co-dependency for at least one of the twins, a lot of times you don't feel like your own person as you have to share everything, etc. It's not always the case, but for a lot of twins it is. A lot of people raise their twins on the premises of \"aww it's cute they get to do everything together\" but reality is a lot of us twins want to be raise and treated as separate units like every other person.\n\nBut pretending that they are twins when they aren't? They were never twins and should never have been raised like they were. I don't doubt you love Alice the same as George, but...this is something you should never had lied about. They are not twins. They should not have been forced to act as twins in false pretenses. And you should have never had your family lying for you. Alice deserved to have her own birthday, her own space to be her own person. Alice deserved the truth of her age and birthday from the start.\n\nAnd then you also hid her adoption from her. So when she is already struggling with finding out this information, she has another hit come onto her. She has to now come to terms with the fact that not only is she adopted...her real mother chose to....well...end things...rather then be with her. That essentially is a wave of \"my mother didn't want me so much, she ended things instead\" She has to come to terms with the facts she will never be able to know her real mother. Never be able to ask questions. Never be able to share memories.\n\nBut not only did she just found out her real mother truly left her the worst way possible, she's finding out the mother that raise her LIED to her the entirety of her life. That you and your husband hid from her that not only was she not a twin, she was adopted. That you hid that not only was she adopted, her mother ended her own life. And you decided to keep telling the lie because \"it's too late now\" Wrong. It's never too late to be honest yourself. But you weren't even honest yourself, your husband was but you were not. Adoptees also should be told from as early as they can that they are adopted so they can work through it in an easier enviroment.\n\nShe is understandably really confused and hurt right now.\n\nEverything about her life is being questioned in her mind right now. She has to come to terms with things in her own way. Eventually she will see you did love her truly, but right now you need to give her the space she deserves to work through this new information she has. How long will she not speak? Who knows. It depends what she processes first and how she deals with things. She could just need a few days, she could end up needing longer. Either way it has to be on her terms now.\n\nIt's obvious you truly love her and only wanted to protect her from pain...But these kinds of things are not something you should ever lie about. I do think you will learn from it and do better about trusting she can handle the truth in the future too.\n\nYour other kids aren't as hurt by it, not even George, that's why they \"take your side\" on it. For George, he only found out he was lied to about being a twin. Yes, his own world is being questioned, but not nearly as much as Alice's world right now. This isn't about who is right and who is wrong. This is about Alice finding out her entire life was one big lie.   \n\n\nYour husband, while he is still an AH for waiting so long, is right. She needed to know so she could take care of her baby to the best of her ability. Including about the heavy PPD her mother had, as it might be something she ends up struggling with. If any side is \"right\" right now, it's him for telling her the truth so she could have her medical history.", "YTA\n\nI think adopting her was great.

And proud of yourself for doing such a good job she never realized.. that just has to make the lie hurt worse and the identity crisis she\u2019s going through that much more profound. \n\nI can\u2019t help but wonder if you all (your whole family) also wanted to forget your guilt.

Especially because saying \u201cI have all of my family history available to me\u201d and \u201chalf my family history is unknown\u201d can be important information. OP sounds so annoyed with the person for telling her, no remorse for her actions and for the horrible turmoil her adopted child and birth child both are probably experiencing because of this.\n\nI mean a big complaint of adopted families both for parents and adoptee, is that you don\u2019t often have answers, which is why a lot of parents choose to hide it like OP did.

It doesn't matter that the situation was hard on OP she did the wrong thing just like every other adoptive parent who tries to hide it.", "You tell the story in an age appropriate manner, but you are always honest.  At younger ages you explain that her mother, your sister, loves her very much, but died young.  You loved her so much that you took her in to care for raise as your own child.  The story can evolve with age as the girl begins to ask questions and has a greater capacity to understand.  You can even say that some of the details will be explained further when she is older.

When she asked about her birth mother, she should have been told age appropriate info. Even 4 yr olds can understand suicide.

Then she could have grown up knowing exactly who her mom was. Yes, the details would slowly be told to her as she got older and asked questions. \"Who is my daddy?\" Then you explain who he was and that he was not ready to be a daddy so he let them raise her. \"How did my mom die?\" That would be a hard talk but start the same. With simple info and let them ask questions.", "Try being adopted and lied to, the rage comes naturally. And no, OP is the biggest asshole I've ever seen on this sub. You're carrying water for someone who lied for decades about something born children take for granted: where did I come from. \n\nPut yourself in an adopted person's shoes and ask yourself the same question. You can never know for sure, and asshole lying parents only make it worse.", "No. Adoptive parents who lie and don\u2019t tell children are awful people.

I agree there's serious issues about the narrative spun in this case but kids can get really fucked up when they're told their parents aren't their \"real\" parents. They often get the rejection complex. There's also no point telling children about death when they're too young to understand it and you stay well clear of suicide. By aged 10 they'd then know their Mum killed herself, blame themselves and that's some burden to carry (even though it's not remotely their fault). Ultimately, it's up to the adoptive parents how they deal with it, we shouldn't judge. I regret commenting on this thread in the first place now.", "OP is not a robot. Her sister died in such a manner, I wouldn't trust anyone to be able to talk objectively.", "I agree with most of what you've said but it's real life and not everything follows a text book. The OP was grieving for her sister and did what she thought was right to include the child into her family as seamlessly as possibly. She hasn't handled it well at all but I won't slag her off for it. The  only thing I will disagree with you on is telling them from the beginning. That's just my opinion and is pretty irrelevant at this stage. I just hope they can repair their relationship and the OP understands why her daughter is so angry.b", "OK. That's your opinion. However, I believe people who make sweeping generalisions about others, particles those who adopt with the best intentions, are awful people.

This occurred in the late 90s- not the 60s.", "Regarding Amended Birth Certificates, adoptee here. It depends on the way they did the amended BC. Mine did not have a raised seal on it, and so when the Real ID law/regulation went through a few years ago, my new driver's license said my driver's license couldn't be used for Identification. This was because my birth certificate didn't have a raised seal, and said, \"Amended for adoption\" at the top of it. So, it was no longer good enough.\n\nSo wound up spending a day in our state capital trying to get a proper birth certificate issued, which required me to actually go to court (on my dime), present a need to the court why this is necessary (It's your law, dumbasses...I can't get on a plane anymore without it, and they are refusing to renew my passport), and get various bits signed at vital records and the adoption agency. The judge decided to unseal the original, and allow them to draw up a new amended one but this time with a seal. And I wasn't the only adult adoptee dealing with this on that day. Most of them were from catholic family services as I was.\n\nStill salty over how much MY OWN BIRTH CERTIFICATE properly formatted to satisfy the government requirements cost me. It was not cheap. \n\nAs for OP....a bit fat YTA. Adoption is traumatic to kids. Sometimes it's necessary, but it's still traumatic.

What the actual hell?
