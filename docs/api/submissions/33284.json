That trust is shattered. And don't you dare think about blaming your husband for this. He's equally the asshole to for waiting so long.

So it was never a surprise. \n\nOf course you had to tell her - your husband is absolutely right that she especially needed to know now that she\u2019s expecting herself - she\u2019s missing 50% of her medical history!!!

There\u2019s a LOT of information out there in the adoptee and donor conceived community about best practices and you blatantly ignored your kid\u2019s trust and right to form her own identity in certain ways.

Children are not as fragile as people and many kids who know about it early are proud of being adopted.\n\nInstead you made a lie like her being adopted was shameful, leading to a terrible reaction. You made it seem like you were ashamed of how she came into the family enough to lie for almost 27 years", "YTA \n\nAdoptee here, I've always known I was adopted. There was never a time I remember being \"told\", it always just was a fact. Being adopted is nothing shameful, but you've created stigma and shame around it by hiding it from her and lying to her and your other kids their whole lives.

It\u2019s been the recommended practice SINCE THE 1960s to tell a child from DAY ONE that they\u2019re adopted. That way they grow up always knowing.

I'm an adoptive parent, and pretty much everything I've ever seen indicates that they should know right away because it is hugely upending to find out when they are older (basically everything they've known now feels like a lie).

They know the broad contours, and as they get more mature, I provide more details in age appropriate ways. There are some details that I don't think they can handle until they're adults (or maybe don't ever need, we'll cross that bridge in a decade). My kids were both adopted as infants from foster care,  and even as grade schoolers, there are parts of their story that they aren't ready for (your birth parents loved you but couldn't take care of you, but there are people whose job it is to give those kids safe and loving homes is basically the current explanation). But ultimately, it's their story, and they deserve to know it", "Honesty is the best policy", "Wow. YTA", "I have to go with YTA. I was adopted as a baby. As soon as I could comprehend and understand, my parents made sure I knew. All my siblings, aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins, etc treated me as family and no issues whatsoever.\n\nYes,  the adoption did happen due to a tragedy.

Maybe not beyond repair, but damaged nonetheless.", "YTA and I don't need context. I can tell by the title alone. There is no excuse for hiding such an important thing from someone.", "YTA. You lied to all of your children for their entire lives. You actively denied your daughter the right to know her father and denied her father the chance to get to know his daughter. There is no defending this kind of action as it was done selfishly. There is no reason to keep this information from her other than to make things easier for yourself. Keeping the massive, life altering secret from her is honestly just lazy and shameful. This would definitely cause me to question if you were trustworthy. You have failed your daughter and arguably your biological children as well.", "YTA, what a miserable lie and secret to keep from someone.", "YTA - you\u2019ve created an avoidable disaster for your family.

The very fact you think it was a success that she \"never even realized\" she isn't yours biologically is pretty horrifying. It's even worse that you convinced her she and your son were twins, presumably also potentially erasing her own birthday? For god's sake adoption was absolutely not taboo in the 90's, why did you do this? This is something people did 50+ years ago. I really can't understand your thought process with this at all. \n\nYou owe your daughter a massive apology and a lot of groveling. I also strongly suggest you read up on the effects adoption can have on something. You severely betrayed your daughter, and irreparably damaged your relationship with her.

YTA and so is your husband.", "As a birth mom and an adoptive mom.. what the fuck? \n\nYes you are a massive asshole. YTA", "YTA, 100%. As an adoptee who grew up just knowing she was adopted as an inherent fact (i.e. it was never a secret, it was just something I knew, there was not big \u201crevelation\u201d moment), it helped me understand a lot of things about my life and the way I was treated by people and some of my family. Knowing at a very young age helped me be able to form my identity about things I *had* choices in, and not just my adoption. It also helped me understand that families and love come in so many different forms, and that biological relationships aren\u2019t the end-all-be-all.\n\nThere\u2019s so much trauma that can come along with being adopted, and by letting us adoptees have our whole lifetimes to learn to understand with it, live with it, and navigate it throughout our lives is so much better than throwing us into turmoil later on in life where it\u2019s harder to learn the tools to function with the information and not feel so lost. There are also medical reasons for us to know, among many other reasons, and your husband was correct in actually telling her (albeit way too late) especially because you are hinting that her mother struggled with PPD which is important, potentially lifesaving information for Alice during this pregnancy. Stop making excuses. Yes, you raised her, but that\u2019s not an excuse for keeping an extreme secret from her. You didn\u2019t \u201cdo a good job because she never realized.\u201d You can\u2019t pat yourself on the back for that while you actively did her a disservice.

Withholding such fundamental information about who a person is, is wrong on so many levels.\n\nAlso - you raised them as twins?

Someone who if you talk to twins, you're connected to on another level. That deep connection and relationship she's had her entire life was based on a lie. If you're willing to lie about something like that then obviously little lies would mean nothing to you. So what else have you lied to her about? She's questioning her entire existence because of this. It's alot to take in already finding out you're adopted at that age. But then she's got so much else that was just a lie.

She should have been told from day one. Now she has to wonder why it was kept secret", "YTAThis isn't about you not raising her well. I'm sure she was raised well and truly loved. This is about the emotional feelings she is going through right now finding out her whole life and bloodline was a lie. Finding out that not only was she not actually a twin to her brother...but that she was adopted. Unless you have had one or both happen to you, you do not understand.\n\nRegarding the Twin thing: Look being raised as a twin honestly sucks as is. I am a twin btw. A lot of twins, myself included, truly struggle to figure out their own independent personalitys as adults because growing up...we are raised to be each others best friends. It's honestly rough when you start the separating process and are having to learn to be without your twin for the first real times ever. I wouldn't wish twinship on anyone to be honest. A lot of times it builds a heavy co-dependency for at least one of the twins, a lot of times you don't feel like your own person as you have to share everything, etc. It's not always the case, but for a lot of twins it is. A lot of people raise their twins on the premises of \"aww it's cute they get to do everything together\" but reality is a lot of us twins want to be raise and treated as separate units like every other person.\n\nBut pretending that they are twins when they aren't? They were never twins and should never have been raised like they were. I don't doubt you love Alice the same as George, but...this is something you should never had lied about. They are not twins. They should not have been forced to act as twins in false pretenses. And you should have never had your family lying for you. Alice deserved to have her own birthday, her own space to be her own person. Alice deserved the truth of her age and birthday from the start.\n\nAnd then you also hid her adoption from her. So when she is already struggling with finding out this information, she has another hit come onto her. She has to now come to terms with the fact that not only is she adopted...her real mother chose to....well...end things...rather then be with her. That essentially is a wave of \"my mother didn't want me so much, she ended things instead\" She has to come to terms with the facts she will never be able to know her real mother. Never be able to ask questions. Never be able to share memories.\n\nBut not only did she just found out her real mother truly left her the worst way possible, she's finding out the mother that raise her LIED to her the entirety of her life. That you and your husband hid from her that not only was she not a twin, she was adopted. That you hid that not only was she adopted, her mother ended her own life. And you decided to keep telling the lie because \"it's too late now\" Wrong. It's never too late to be honest yourself. But you weren't even honest yourself, your husband was but you were not. Adoptees also should be told from as early as they can that they are adopted so they can work through it in an easier enviroment.\n\nShe is understandably really confused and hurt right now.\n\nEverything about her life is being questioned in her mind right now. She has to come to terms with things in her own way. Eventually she will see you did love her truly, but right now you need to give her the space she deserves to work through this new information she has. How long will she not speak? Who knows. It depends what she processes first and how she deals with things. She could just need a few days, she could end up needing longer. Either way it has to be on her terms now.\n\nIt's obvious you truly love her and only wanted to protect her from pain...But these kinds of things are not something you should ever lie about. I do think you will learn from it and do better about trusting she can handle the truth in the future too.\n\nYour other kids aren't as hurt by it, not even George, that's why they \"take your side\" on it. For George, he only found out he was lied to about being a twin. Yes, his own world is being questioned, but not nearly as much as Alice's world right now. This isn't about who is right and who is wrong. This is about Alice finding out her entire life was one big lie.   \n\n\nYour husband, while he is still an AH for waiting so long, is right. She needed to know so she could take care of her baby to the best of her ability. Including about the heavy PPD her mother had, as it might be something she ends up struggling with. If any side is \"right\" right now, it's him for telling her the truth so she could have her medical history.", "YTA\n\nI think adopting her was great.

And proud of yourself for doing such a good job she never realized.. that just has to make the lie hurt worse and the identity crisis she\u2019s going through that much more profound. \n\nI can\u2019t help but wonder if you all (your whole family) also wanted to forget your guilt.
