When my in-laws found out about her grades and the fact that a $5,000 scholarship probably won't be renewed next year, they told her she needs to live at home during the summers and get a job, along with getting a job while at college.

Tara is an adult. They can get on board of get out of the way. There are no third options.", "NTA - She's an adult and she made an arrangement with you. Her parents not liking it doesn't mean a thing. Her parents need to respect their daughter's wishes. She may or may not fail, but that's beside the point.", "NTA but I can see where the parents are coming from.\n\n1. Tara is an adult\n2. While I generally agree that working a job through college is good for a number of reasons, I do agree with you that it's counterproductive that punishment for struggling academically is to get a job.\n3. That said, if she's not taking a full load of classes during the summer, I don't think a part time job would hurt, and would help teach her some financial responsibility. Letting her do nothing other than a few summer courses while you pay her rent/board seems like a bit of a potential for disaster.", "NTA Your logic tracks.", "NTA. Tara is an adult. You are an adult. It's between the pair of you. Parents need to stop treating her like a child. Maybe that has something to do with the problems she has.", ">My in-laws are upset, and confronted me at dinner the other night about stepping on their toes and undermining them as parents.\n\nNTA. What is it with this statement when they're talking about an adult? Probably part of her problem was they over managed her and so she had issues doing it herself. Are they paying for her schooling? I mean I would be upset she lost a scholarship too, do they have to make up for it? \n\nI mean if you cover her housing, it might even out. I'm trying to work out why they feel this is valid. Tara definitely needs to work on herself but I don't think a second chance is bad per se. She does need to work over the summer though. \n\n>They also suggested that she should consider living at home, holding down a job, and getting a degree from the local college instead.\n\nOh I bet that would really improve things. /s", "NTA.", "NTA OP!!!\n\nNot by a long shot. Your SIL is lucky to have you.", "NTA. Your sister in law is an adult so she shouldn't have to live under the thumb of controlling adults like your in-laws seem to be. She is also young and is having her first taste if freedom so she is obviously going to struggle a little with balancing her social life and school life, especially in her first year of schooling.\n\nLots of young people struggle with this kinda thing and need useful help, not punitive treatment that her parents seem to want to inflict.\n\nYou're right about how taking on a job would make her struggle even more with school than she already is.\n\nWhen I was in college I considered getting a part-time job, but when I saw my younger sister coming home at two in the morning because her boss asked her to stay late I knew it would be a mistake since I knew there would be no way I would be able to say no and my grades would suffer.\n\nFor me either my school work would suffer or my potential work history would suffer and I wanted to graduate. \n\nIt sounds like your young adult sister in law has realized her mistakes and wants to correct them and is willing to do the work in order to make that happen. But it sounds like her parents just want to drag her home so that they can take away any hope of a good future in order to punish and control her and her life.\n\nYou said it yourself about how making someone who is already struggling with school struggle with both school and a job would make matters worse.\n\nMake sure your husband can't prevent you from helping her financially. Your sister in law deserves another chance and shouldn't be punished for minor mistakes that almost everyone makes at some point.\n\nShe isn't a minor, so there is no legitimate claim that you are overstepping. You and she had a mature adult conversation where she told you what she was willing to do and you offered her help rather than drag her into a controlling situation. Sounds like her parents are probably ticked off that she lives six hours away and they can't control her anymore.\n\nIf she is going to make up for her mistakes she needs the chance to do so and you giving her that chance is a good thing. Thinking about what her parents are demanding of her sounds like she won't stand a chance of graduating any college and will be stuck is she is forced to go back home.", "INFO: what will you do a year from now if she's still failing her classes? Will you continue to financially support her? I don't think that what her parents want for her is entirely unreasonable. I understand why she doesn't want to go home; she wants to be free to do things her way. But doing things her way was what got her into this situation, so you should make it clear that you won't keep paying her bills if she continues spending more time drinking and dating than studying. Also, living in her own place doesn't necessarily mean she'll stop partying. She could easily host parties at her place, and if her friends trash the place you'll be on the hook with the landlord.", "YTA.\nSounds like you didn't discuss it with anyone else before making this big decision.\nYeah, SIL is a legal adult now. But she is obviously dependent on others.\nDid you talk to your husband about this before agreeing?", "YTA. Your are overstepping in multiple levels. You're not her parent and you don't get to use the she's an adult logic when you're not treating her like an adult but just paying away her problems for her.  Also, that his a huge amount of money to offer out without talking with your husband about it. You don't make major commitments like that without discussing it with your partner.", "YTA. Even though you meant well, you did interfere with their parenting. They weren't applying any strict punishments to her, they were making adjustments that would help her take more responsibility for the costs of schooling. I'm guessing they are incurring a lot of costs for this prestigious school that she might not be up for, or might not be treating seriously. So even though she's an adult, she is dependent on others and it's not fair for you to insert yourself when they have financial liability on the line. You seem incredibly presumptuous to be interjecting about the flaws you see in their reasoning, but they aren't ripping her out of this school, they are talking about what might be appropriate given how her first year went, and if she isn't going to spend her time at the school wisely it would indeed be better to gain some maturity and earn a credential, closer to home. \n\nThe fact that you did this without even talking to your husband, never mind his parents, is a major breach.", "I'm sorry but I'll go with YTA. Tara is not your daughter. It would have been best if you give her advice instead, ant not overstep boundaries. You probably hurt her parents by making a decision on your own, when they should be the one handling the situation.\n\nThey have the right to be mad at you, because what you did is enabling her actions and probably spoiled her a little bit.\n\nYes she is an adult, and that means she should know that her actions has consequences. You just taught her that she can get away with it, and not be responsible of her own bad decisions or actions.\n\nIt's not like her parents told her to stop going to school, they just want her to learn a lesson by doing the hard work. \n\nBut lastly, you are not the parent. Let parents be parents and teach their own kid a lesson.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not doing well her first semester should have been a wake up call.  Remember these are consequences to her actions. She needs to show some responsibility and remorse but instead went crying to someone who would listen and who would give her what she wanted. I think you jumped the gun on offering to pay for an apartment. Even though she is an adult she is still very dependent on her parents. You should have discussed this with your husband FIRST then their parents and come up with a plan together.", "I am impressed that she came up with some strategies to help her do better.", "Depending on the school summer classes might be 4/5 days a week with each class being half a day. A full load at the local colleges in my area for the summer is considered to be about 6 units/2classes.", "I was thinking the same.. probably overly sheltered and strict parenting is why SIL was a bit untethered during her freshman year. OP giving her that 2nd chance is super wholesome!\n\nThis is 2023.. if a young adult doesn't receive help from people; they will undoubtedly fail in life. Teaching \"independence\" by offering no financial help and saying \"get a job\" might have worked 30-40 years ago... but now they might as well be giving her a tent and saying \"see ya!\"", "They're not paying for anything continuously, but they did do things like furnish/decorate her dorm room and buy her a bunch of food when she started.", "\ud83d\udcaf%", "I told her that we would take a look at her grades and how she felt about how the year went and reassess, and that my support extended to this coming year only. One thing she said is that there's a ton of partying in the dorms but the apartments were quieter, and she thought there would be fewer people to knock on her door and tempt her to come to their room in an apartment than there would be in a dorm with roommates.", "Most adults are dependent on others. OP is limiting the amount of dependents that SIL needs to rely on. Especially with how 'DIY' The in laws seem to be. Probably boomers who think $8/hr is a living wage like 50 years ago. I doubt SIL's future would be too bright living at home with them.\n\nOP is NTA", "We have a joint account for joint expenses, but don't talk to each other about what we do with the money from our own salaries.", "She would only be overstepping if we were talking about a minor child. Tara made some mistakes and if OP is paying out of her own money she doesn't need anyone else's permission. \n\nJudging by what was described about the parents she won't stand a chance at getting a better education if she returns home. Working a job can cause one's grades to suffer, whether it's in college or high school.", "Most adults are dependent on others. Even successful adults end up relying on others.\n\nParenting is a foregone situation when the kid is no longer a kid.\n\nI wish I had a person in my life like OP when I was SIL's age.", "People are so punitive to young adults and think that \"teaching them a lesson\" is the appropriate path to success... my mom (passed away now) used this method on me when I had financial troubles at 20y/o.. now Im 31; have an awesome career, a whole family and... am still shackled by financial debts caused by those \"lessons\".. its 2023, credit scores exist and these \"lessons\" because a 20 y/o wants to be a 20 y/o can affect them long after they gain some responsibility...\n\nOP is an awesome person and SIL is lucky to have a rational and financially capable person in her life to make sure she isn't plagued by stupid punitive logic.", "That's it? That's $1K one time. They set up her dorm and gave her food at the beginning of the year and they're running their mouths about you stepping on their parenting of an adult? If they're not paying her bills, they don't get a say anymore. \n\nAre they going to have to cover the $5K loss? I'm very sorry, I just don't understand this. I get they want the best and want her to be more responsible but they had eighteen years for that.\n\nI don't understand these comments that you overstepped on their decisions because it's not their decision anymore. Tara needs to handle her problems, which she did, by speaking to you. They're just mad they can't yank her back.", "Once her friends find out she has her own place, they'll want to come over for parties because there'll be more room and no RAs telling them what to do. I think it's good that you want to help her. But I am a college professor. I've taught many students like your niece. They're smart but they get caught up in the college experience; they think that being smart is enough and so they slack off in their work. College professors generally expect students to work more independently than they did in high school, which is why it's a lot easier for students like your niece to skip classes and/or studying. But if she's already on academic probation, the college will only give her a set amount of time to get her act together before she gets kicked out altogether. So she needs to buckle down, go to tutoring centers if there are any at her college, go to office hours, stop drinking so much, etc. If she can prove to her parents that she can do it, maybe they'll back off. But at the same time it's quite possible that she'll continue to struggle this coming school year if she doesn't change her bad study habits."]}
