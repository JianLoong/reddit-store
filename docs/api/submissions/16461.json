She may or may not fail, but that's beside the point.", "NTA but I can see where the parents are coming from.\n\n1. Tara is an adult\n2. While I generally agree that working a job through college is good for a number of reasons, I do agree with you that it's counterproductive that punishment for struggling academically is to get a job.\n3. That said, if she's not taking a full load of classes during the summer, I don't think a part time job would hurt, and would help teach her some financial responsibility. Letting her do nothing other than a few summer courses while you pay her rent/board seems like a bit of a potential for disaster.", "NTA Your logic tracks.", "NTA. Tara is an adult. You are an adult. It's between the pair of you. Parents need to stop treating her like a child. Maybe that has something to do with the problems she has.", ">My in-laws are upset, and confronted me at dinner the other night about stepping on their toes and undermining them as parents.\n\nNTA. What is it with this statement when they're talking about an adult? Probably part of her problem was they over managed her and so she had issues doing it herself. Are they paying for her schooling? I mean I would be upset she lost a scholarship too, do they have to make up for it? \n\nI mean if you cover her housing, it might even out. I'm trying to work out why they feel this is valid. Tara definitely needs to work on herself but I don't think a second chance is bad per se. She does need to work over the summer though. \n\n>They also suggested that she should consider living at home, holding down a job, and getting a degree from the local college instead.\n\nOh I bet that would really improve things. /s", "NTA.", "NTA OP!!!\n\nNot by a long shot. Your SIL is lucky to have you.", "NTA. Your sister in law is an adult so she shouldn't have to live under the thumb of controlling adults like your in-laws seem to be. She is also young and is having her first taste if freedom so she is obviously going to struggle a little with balancing her social life and school life, especially in her first year of schooling.\n\nLots of young people struggle with this kinda thing and need useful help, not punitive treatment that her parents seem to want to inflict.\n\nYou're right about how taking on a job would make her struggle even more with school than she already is.\n\nWhen I was in college I considered getting a part-time job, but when I saw my younger sister coming home at two in the morning because her boss asked her to stay late I knew it would be a mistake since I knew there would be no way I would be able to say no and my grades would suffer.\n\nFor me either my school work would suffer or my potential work history would suffer and I wanted to graduate. \n\nIt sounds like your young adult sister in law has realized her mistakes and wants to correct them and is willing to do the work in order to make that happen. But it sounds like her parents just want to drag her home so that they can take away any hope of a good future in order to punish and control her and her life.\n\nYou said it yourself about how making someone who is already struggling with school struggle with both school and a job would make matters worse.\n\nMake sure your husband can't prevent you from helping her financially. Your sister in law deserves another chance and shouldn't be punished for minor mistakes that almost everyone makes at some point.\n\nShe isn't a minor, so there is no legitimate claim that you are overstepping. You and she had a mature adult conversation where she told you what she was willing to do and you offered her help rather than drag her into a controlling situation. Sounds like her parents are probably ticked off that she lives six hours away and they can't control her anymore.\n\nIf she is going to make up for her mistakes she needs the chance to do so and you giving her that chance is a good thing. Thinking about what her parents are demanding of her sounds like she won't stand a chance of graduating any college and will be stuck is she is forced to go back home.", "INFO: what will you do a year from now if she's still failing her classes? Will you continue to financially support her? I don't think that what her parents want for her is entirely unreasonable. I understand why she doesn't want to go home; she wants to be free to do things her way. But doing things her way was what got her into this situation, so you should make it clear that you won't keep paying her bills if she continues spending more time drinking and dating than studying. Also, living in her own place doesn't necessarily mean she'll stop partying. She could easily host parties at her place, and if her friends trash the place you'll be on the hook with the landlord.", "YTA.\nSounds like you didn't discuss it with anyone else before making this big decision.\nYeah, SIL is a legal adult now. But she is obviously dependent on others.\nDid you talk to your husband about this before agreeing?", "YTA. Your are overstepping in multiple levels. You're not her parent and you don't get to use the she's an adult logic when you're not treating her like an adult but just paying away her problems for her.  Also, that his a huge amount of money to offer out without talking with your husband about it. You don't make major commitments like that without discussing it with your partner.", "YTA. Even though you meant well, you did interfere with their parenting. They weren't applying any strict punishments to her, they were making adjustments that would help her take more responsibility for the costs of schooling. I'm guessing they are incurring a lot of costs for this prestigious school that she might not be up for, or might not be treating seriously. So even though she's an adult, she is dependent on others and it's not fair for you to insert yourself when they have financial liability on the line. You seem incredibly presumptuous to be interjecting about the flaws you see in their reasoning, but they aren't ripping her out of this school, they are talking about what might be appropriate given how her first year went, and if she isn't going to spend her time at the school wisely it would indeed be better to gain some maturity and earn a credential, closer to home. \n\nThe fact that you did this without even talking to your husband, never mind his parents, is a major breach.", "I'm sorry but I'll go with YTA. Tara is not your daughter. It would have been best if you give her advice instead, ant not overstep boundaries. You probably hurt her parents by making a decision on your own, when they should be the one handling the situation.\n\nThey have the right to be mad at you, because what you did is enabling her actions and probably spoiled her a little bit.\n\nYes she is an adult, and that means she should know that her actions has consequences. You just taught her that she can get away with it, and not be responsible of her own bad decisions or actions.\n\nIt's not like her parents told her to stop going to school, they just want her to learn a lesson by doing the hard work. \n\nBut lastly, you are not the parent.

Teaching \"independence\" by offering no financial help and saying \"get a job\" might have worked 30-40 years ago... but now they might as well be giving her a tent and saying \"see ya!\"", "They're not paying for anything continuously, but they did do things like furnish/decorate her dorm room and buy her a bunch of food when she started.", "\ud83d\udcaf%", "I told her that we would take a look at her grades and how she felt about how the year went and reassess, and that my support extended to this coming year only.

I think it's good that you want to help her. But I am a college professor. I've taught many students like your niece. They're smart but they get caught up in the college experience; they think that being smart is enough and so they slack off in their work. College professors generally expect students to work more independently than they did in high school, which is why it's a lot easier for students like your niece to skip classes and/or studying. But if she's already on academic probation, the college will only give her a set amount of time to get her act together before she gets kicked out altogether. So she needs to buckle down, go to tutoring centers if there are any at her college, go to office hours, stop drinking so much, etc. If she can prove to her parents that she can do it, maybe they'll back off. But at the same time it's quite possible that she'll continue to struggle this coming school year if she doesn't change her bad study habits.", "As much as I agree with you and your approach I am struggling to see how it's okay for you to make this type of financial decision without talking to your partner about it.\nThat's a LOT of money you promised his sister.\nSo I need more info.\nDo you guys have completely separate finances and you spending this amount of money has no effect on him?", "Ehhhhh.\n\nYou're NTA.

Good chance she was sheltered/controlled at home and not given a chance to get out in the real world and learn how to function in it.", "NTA.

I don't need to use your head to figure out my next move. I need to use my own.\"", "We will, and we talk/see each other more frequently anyway. I was typing quickly and basically just mean that the final data point will be her year-end grades.", "INFO: what\u2019s wrong with the local college and what field is it in? Nothing wrong with saving money and taking summer courses at a community college. I\u2019m an engineer and it doesn\u2019t matter much where you degree was from.", "You're majorly overstepping. YTA.", "NTA for wanting to help her out after struggling, but I see the parent\u2019s point of view. You basically are letting her get out of responsibilities and will pay for everything and even house her for a year. Personally I don\u2019t think she will magically change fully and get better, it\u2019ll be a process. Also I do think you kinda under minded them as parents, but your SIL can make her own adult decisions. You just gotta live with it that you kinda made your relationship with your in laws weird now.", "NTA - she\u2019s an adult & it doesn\u2019t seem like her parents are setting her up for success. Way to step in and make things right!", "That\u2019s awfully generous of you. Are you close to Tara?", "NAH\n\nI don't see what her parents were planning as punishment, necessarily. At least not if they took it step-wise vs making the full decision immediately (like...first, move home for the summer and work to make up the possibly lost scholarship, if that goes well try the college again). \n\nDealing with natural consequences of your actions (lose scholarship, have to warn the money yourself) isn't a punishment and can definitely help some people mature. Her parents possibly were jumping the gun, but your post doesn't say they decided against the prestigious school, it was just a consideration.\n\nYour support can also have the desired end effects, of course. Ultimately I think both sides here want the best outcome for her, they just have different approaches.", "NTA. from a parental point of view you are overstepping, from a human being point of view you are doing a good thing.  Tara is LEGALLY an adult but figuring out adulting is hard. You\u2019re giving her a chance to figure that out on her own after she has already learned what not to do. She\u2019ll (hopefully) always be grateful.", "That's extremely generous of you to finance her apartment and Summer school.  I think that is a nice compromise on everyone's part.   However you really need to make sure she understands the consequences if she wants to party and goof around instead of actually going to college.  I wasn't the best student but worked my rear end off, heck I can't even discuss what music was popular ten years ago.  NTAH on your part.", "NTA - we all deserve second chances. I hope the niece knows how lucky she is and values OP accordingly.", "NTA\n\n> My in-laws are upset, and confronted me at dinner the other night about stepping on their toes and undermining them as parents.\n\nTheir daughter is an adult; you giving an adult other options by offering financial support isn\u2019t undermining because they do not have authority over an adult.\n\n> They think that Tara needs to be taught a lesson \n\nThis is stupid.\n\n*Life* and the consequences of her own decisions will teach her lessons - like losing a scholarship. Trying to artificially impose consequences on an adult is inappropriate.\n\nThere\u2019s no harm to giving her this chance; because if she fails out, again, that will be the lesson. And then moving home to go to a local college will be a fall back option.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason to go totally nuclear here.\n\n> and learn some responsibility, which my bankrolling her won't give her. \n\nI think they are being pretty harsh on someone who is in the early years of adulthood; the transition from parental authority and oversight to independence can be tough.\n\nIf this is just the loss of a 5k scholarship and retaking one class\u2026\n\nHonestly that\u2019s not bad.\n\nI think they are overreacting. If it was a cost issue I\u2019d be more understanding - but wanting to punish an adult for not behaving perfectly is gross. She didn\u2019t hurt anyone. She didn\u2019t hit someone drunk driving. She didn\u2019t sexually harrass someone or participate in hazing where someone was injured.\n\nShe had to audit a class because she was going to fail it.\n\n> I also said that I genuinely don't think there's any lesson to be learned from forcing someone to struggle with both a job and school\n\nWell. I actually do disagree with this (but I don\u2019t think it makes you an asshole) having a job can actually help with learning time management, because it becomes much harder to skip studying etc as you don\u2019t have what may seem like endless time. \n\nGetting away from the dorm environment might certainly help though.\n\n \u201cDon\u2019t help my adult kid so I can teach them a lesson by making their life harder\u201d is gross.", "NTA- I feel like everyone especially sheltered kids go little nuts their first year of college. The biggest thing is that she's self aware enough to know where she messed up and what she needs to do to fix it.", "NTA\n\nI wish more kids had this kind of opportunity. The fact that she called you for advice, and then you both had what sounds like a very productive, mature discussion about it, tells me that you\u2019re making the right choice and she\u2019ll very likely get back on track. It\u2019s hard for parents to let go, but at some point we have to. Your in laws don\u2019t sound awful, I\u2019d guess this is the first time your SIL has made a decision of this magnitude without their help or input.", "To me at least OP sucks for not talking it through with her husband first, this is his family ESH", "What natural consequence? Sil got the consequence already\u2014 the loss of the scholarship and being put on academic probation. She also figured out a plan to get back on track. If that\u2019s not learning from mistakes, what is?", "Okay cmon she can work. Many people go to school early in the day and then work.", "Imo it sounds like your niece is selling you a bill of lies and you just bought her an all expenses paid party pad. In my experience, way more parting happened in apartments. Like the other commenter said, larger places and even less supervision.", "That\u2019s not bad, but if you\u2019re going to spend a huge amount on their family member then I think that should have definitely been discussed with them. I don\u2019t understand Reddit, they want people to be able to do whatever they want without discussing with a spouse. On certain things yes, but this should have been discussed.", "My college made everyone take a course on how to succeed in college. While working a full time job is doable, it\u2019s also not ideal. College expects you to study/do class work outside of class for 2 hours per week for every 1 of lectures. And work is assigned accordingly.\n\nWorking more than 10-15 hours a week while attending full time tends to result in lower grades and mental heath issues.", "It's incredibly presumptuous of you to get into our finances, particularly when I've explicitly said that our partner have agreed that we don't need to discuss these types of things. You're not married to either of us. Do you tell every couple you meet what they should and shouldn't discuss, or just strangers?", "You literally just asked a question on AITA about family finances and problems for all of reddit to answer \ud83d\ude02 so yeah, strangers are gonna are tell you.\n\nClearly your partner is feeling some new type of way about this arrangement because they got upset as well. Talk to them more than replying to me", "I asked a question about my actions toward Tara, not whether I should discuss the money with my husband. He's upset because he thinks I undermined his parents, not because I spent what was frankly a totally inconsequential amount of the money I earned at my job.", "Yeah I agree you also undermined them for sure. And helped her take the easy way out kinda by paying for everything now, but since you clearly make enough money I guess their opinion doesn\u2019t matter, right? But hey his SIL is an adult and can accept what she wants from you. You just gotta accept the in-laws are gonna feel some type of way toward you now \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Easy way out my ass. OP here seems to be the only one that cares enough about Tara to find out what the issues were and help Tara through the actual problems she was having. With parents that act like this, no wonder she didn\u2019t come for help from anyone else sooner.", "Then they need more of a compromise. Pay for her rent but have her get a part time and contribute $100 or pay for half of her summer courses and let her get a part time. Looks like it could add more structure to her life. Also let\u2019s remember why she started struggling and almost failing out, she was partying too much \ud83d\udc80 There is no excuse for this other than she is young and made a mistake. And now she gets everything paid for for free and if anything she\u2019ll start partying more now in her apartment. She isn\u2019t gonna become this super responsible person over night. Yes this is definitely the easier way out. If she isn\u2019t getting straight A\u2019s after her first semester back, I would cut it.", "NTA. She\u2019s an adult who made a choice.  She wants to try this.  She isn\u2019t someone to be directed anymore.  It\u2019s hard for some parents to let go but let go we have too. Children are gifts that are not ours to keep. We nurture them.  Love them. Teach them. And let them go.  They are now at the let her go part.", "NTA- She is an adult and asked for support. You stepped in due to her request. You both had a very nature conversation and came up with a plan. Ig anything you are upset that she has other options and doesnt have to fold to their control. What I wouldn't have given to not have had to struggle working over nights 6 days a week and school.", "NTA- Good for you helping your SIL.", "NTA.  Tara is an adult and you are doing her a solid as one adult to another.\n\nETA:  She is also a young adult who needs to be guided and advised like a young adult.  You're giving her a chance to prove that she can buckle down and work on her own.  Her parents want to pile more supervision on top of existing supervision.  I think one of you has figured out that Tara is an adult...", "You're N T A for helping Tara, but you are for not discussing this with your husband first, especially if it's joint money you're using to help her. So, I'm going with a soft ESH.", "NTA but also a part time job DURING college classes is like one of the worst ways to try to help a struggling college student. They want her literally too busy and overworked to drink or have a life instead of learning how to balance those things.", "YTA - this should have been discussed with your husband prior, the first conversation shouldn\u2019t be with his parents present. \n\nNot saying you need his permission as you have made clear in other comments that it is not joint money but it involves his family and would hope he is at least aware of your plans prior to you committing to them and ideally has some input or at least a chance to provide his opinion on the manner. This decision will not just impact your relationships but also your husbands with his Parents (and potentially his sister) which I assume is a higher priority for him than your relationship with them is.", "NTA \nYou came up with a plan fitted to your SIL's needs, rather than a blanket \"come back home where we can make you do what you need to do instead of learning.\" It's first year of college, she can learn and grow.\n\nIf you do this though, make sure you follow through on reassessing in a year. Don't make a habit of bailing her out if she refuses to learn from her mistakes, or she never will.", "Her parents don't mean for her to take summer courses, they want her to pack up and move back home and complete everything there. The college she's at now has a well-known program and plenty of networking opportunities that the local college doesn't have, plus it's in a city she wants to live in. It's basically like telling someone to drop out of NYU because SUNY Oswego is fine.", "Thanks, and yes.", "It's not joint money.", "I'm not sure what school she's going to, but at my school ND literally everyone else I have ever met thatbqent to college, way more partying was done at off campus housing than at school. You literally could not have huge parties in the dorms. Like 20 people max. I lived in a huge house and regularly had parties with upwards of 400 to 500 people in attendance.", "So it would be fine then to take summer courses at home and then go back the following school year. But isn\u2019t she potentially failing out vs dropping out?", "THIS", "Depends on how prestigious the university is. Some forbid you (not sure that's actually enforceable though) from having a job because it's just not possible with the workload and your studies will tank if you do", "Yup, no security, no RA\u2019s or CA\u2019s and way more room. Dorms had rules about alcohol and underage drinking(still happened of course)", "No, she's not on the verge of failing, but her scholarships have varying GPA requirements and she didn't meet them for the particular one she lost. She said she might have failed a class but she switched to an audit in time for the deadline instead.", "And oh my the sticker price difference between the two. If she lost the scholarship and it\u2019s going to be all loans\u2026..YIKES!", "This was particularly tricky for me because my family is very Catholic and the kids weren't being very holy! I was the aunt they came to when they got into trouble or needed to understand something their parents would have classified as 'sin'. I hold lots of secrets, and I just hope my sisters never find out!", "All she does is go to school and party. Working 12-15 hrs at a coffee shop isn\u2019t gonna ruin her \ud83d\ude2d would be better for her actually.", "Can you please show me what school that is that forbids you and that isn\u2019t a full time program or something like that. because she can get a full time job on campus like any regular college student. Harvard students have part times. She is not gonna stress and lose her mind over 12-15 hours a week at a coffee shop.", "So what happens if she doesn\u2019t pull it together after the 1 year lease is up, does she get to go live with you? She is an adult and as an adult shouldn\u2019t go back home.", "Well if u/Legitimate-State8652 has the list of what adults should and shouldn't do, then I guess we need to just defer to the list.", "Check all the comments, all in agreement that she is an adult and needs to cut free of her parents. Assuming that means not going back there\u2026..which they offered as presumably a way to get a degree without tons of debt.", "You don\u2019t understand how learning works, do you?", "YTA a big one! If your SIL is an adult, why are you paying for her? Let me answer for you, it's because she isn't.", "nta. youre a hero, shielding her from controlling parents", "Nta, those parents should be on their knees thanking you, what a wonderful thing you're doing for their daughter", "NTA", "NTA.  You are an adult; she is an adult.  Both of you are allowed to make decisions without having to run them by parents.  She might be your husband's sister, but she is still an adult and it is your money, so he really does not get a say either.  Husband is only ticked off because his parents are pissed, and the parents are only pissed because they wanted their daughter back under their roof and their control.  You messed that up so they're bitter.  Tough for the three of them - parents and son - but ultimately not their life, money or choice.  They either get over it or they don't.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA - I swear I just automatically have beef with a whole generation of older people for this weird mindset of \"struggling through everything makes you learn\"(in this case, anyway). You're giving her a summer to see if she improves in her studies, nothing wrong with that. After summer, everything will be reassessed, again nothing wrong there either. Her parents demanded she get a job over the summer and during the school year. For what reason other than to help pay tuition? You've found very reasonable solutions that favor your SIL. I also agree with you. There's no actual lesson to be learned. She's still a teenager, considered an adult, but still a teen.", "InshaAllah you\u2019re NTA and I\u2019m grateful that you see your SIL situation from a place of understanding rather than disappointment. For her sake I hope everything goes well!", "NTA. Have her contact the financial aid office. They may put her on a probationary period so she can keep her scholarship.

Good on you", "Yeah when you first move out away from your parents it's a huge adjustment. Plus college is so different from high school. It's fair to give her some leeway so she can figure things out.", "LOL!  My dad tried to tell me how late I could stay out with my cousins when I was 25 and had three kids of my own.  Said he was 'protecting' me cause my husband was overseas and someone needed to watch out for me.  Mom told him to remove himself to his fishing cabin for the remainder of my visit. Talk about a shocked Pikachu face!", "INFO\n\nIt really just depends on why she is failing. Is she failing because she is struggling with the material that has been presented to her or is she struggling because she is too busy goofing off and living the \"College Experience\" at parties?", "INFO: Do you share finances with your husband or is all your money separate?", "NTA\n\nWith control-freak parents like that, no wonder Tara had a hard time adjusting the first time she was out from under the parental thumb.", "NTA. You are awesome.", "YTA for not discussing this with your husband. I agree with you about your plan but it sounds like something you should have told your spouse. Maybe make the apartment conditional on her maintaining her grades each semester?", "Yeah, and OP might want to have a discussion with the husband to make sure their views on child rearing align.", "I agree with you but actually think this is an NAH situation. OP seems genuinely concerned about her SIL but also very naive. SIL doesn\u2019t know how to manage her time. She has trouble with self-control. She sounds like one of the kids who were smart enough that they didn\u2019t have to work particularly hard in high school and now she doesn\u2019t have good study skills to be able to be successful in college. Kids like that generally need more support and oversight to be successful, not less. Her parents are probably thinking that if she is at home they can monitor whether she is studying and check in with her regularly to make sure she is passing her classes. That\u2019s one way to make sure SIL completes college. Whereas OP\u2019s solution just seems to be to provide more independence and less oversight, which is likely just going to perpetuate the problem. I think what the SIL really needs is an intermediate level of support where someone checks in with her weekly to teach organization and study skills and make sure she\u2019s not partying too much.", "Why should OP discuss a decision between her and another adult with other adults? She and her husband have separate finances btw so this decision doesn't affect him in any way.", "A d what when they're done with college? Should parents still supervise them? This whole problem is born out of the parents having been over controlling, continuing that isn't going to help Tara.", "All classes at both the colleges local to me are 4 days a week without a lab, 5 days a week with, with labs on Fridays only. I would take 2 classes and be at the campus all day, from 8am to 5pm, Monday-Friday.

This is a very generous, really wonderful thing to do; she\u2019s going to (I hope, I expect) have a greater chance of success with a family member who actually is supportive and invested in her.", "Huh? Elaborate?", "NTA You might also ask Tara what it would take to get her grades up enough to have the scholarship next year. If she doesn't know, she can call the financial aid office and find out. If it's \"get all A's in five classes in summer school, then my suggestion would be to ask around and find 5 classes that are known for easy A's. It's okay if they're not required courses, she probably has to take X number of electives anyway.

I hope she doesn't squander this amazing opportunity you've given her.", "That\u2019s the bit that made me pause. It was straight up N T A for understanding and supporting her.
