I think you should still invite her if you want her to go. Just ask once and if she starts spouting this stuff, just shrug, say \"it's your choice\" then leave it alone. Don't play the games anymore.", "I have a (narcissist) sibling like this. She won't concede to come to anything bc she doesn't think the invitation was grand enough or I didn't grovel enough or something. She never thought I really wanted her to attend. Well guess what? Now I no longer want her or invite her. She created and fulfilled her own delusion.", "Info: I don't understand whom you're referring to. \"My mom declines...\" but you're \"ditching the M-I-L\"?", "Just stop arguing.

In fact right now, we can tell that my MIL has a big up her butt.  Over what? Who knows?  She goes radio silent.  We invited her over today for dinner.  Nope.  Fine with us.  We are not begging and we will not run any of my husbands juicy steaks over either.  She literally lives two minutes away.   I tell my husband, \u201cyou cannot control your mother, but you can control how you react to her\u201d.   Less and less he wants to bother.  He is tired of her drama.  I say invite her once, and that is it.  If she shows up, great.  If not, even better.", "NTA for choosing to no longer invite her. You are entitled to choose the relationships you want in your life. \n\nYTA for telling her \"that's an order\". You can't order your mom around.
