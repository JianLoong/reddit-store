They paid for the apartment and found him a job at McDonald\u2019s that payed decent money. He went to his job until being fired in the summer. At this point he was also on the verge of being kicked out of his apartment due to not paying rent. That\u2019s where I came in.\n\nMy parents asked me to do my \u2018big brother duties\u2019 of helping him pay the rent. I payed it, and he could continue living there. We were all pissed because he didn\u2019t even bother finding a new job or paying rent. He was kicked out last week.\n\nNow, he\u2019s back living with our parents, and they are asking me to give up 50% of my salary money to help him out.

Why are you asking us - you aren't sure if you should be a wage slave for a fat lazy ass adult? <Insert John McEnroe's catchphrase here...>", "NTA. \n\nSo assuming you live in the US, let me do a breakdown for you. \n\nMinimum wage jobs are awful, but very plentiful right now in any state in the USA. They are not enough for any independent person to live on, but are ideal for a high school student who lives at home. Well, that's your brother, at 28, he is living at home, so we can do a breakdown of him having a minimum wage job of let's say $10 an hour. If he worked 40 hours a week at that rate, he would make about $21k a year, so let's say take home pay of $15k. Since he has no rent and can likely get free food at home too, let's say he spends $500 a month on a cell phone bill and transportation, leaving him $9k. This is a very conservative math breakdown. Meaning he could be saving $9k in just one year of working at the lowest paid job we can find, and preparing himself to move out. Given his age, he wouldn't stay at minimum wage for long and at some point he was making enough of his salary to pay rent, so my guess is he wasn't getting that low of a wage. In one year of living at home, he would have enough to pay for and furnish an apartment, and then likely have a salary level to afford rent. He's also had 10 years to enact this plan. \n\nWhy should this man take away a dime from your daughter? Every penny you spend on him is less money for braces, private school, dance classes, college, or an emergency fund should something happen. He has had every opportunity in life and he has wasted them all, so why put him above your child's present and future needs? \n\nGive a firm no, then tell them there will be no money- zero- from you going forward. If it ever gets brought up again, you are exiting the conversation, and if they hound you about it, it will impact how much you visit and talk to them. Done.", "NTA tell your parents to stop enabling his poor behavior. They need to change the password to their internet and NOT give it to your brother.
