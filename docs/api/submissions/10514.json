I\u2019m betting that despite having a uterus, you had to learn.  Just like every parent of every gender who came before you.

Choosing to not learn how to take care of his kid is weaponizing his incompetence to force you to keep doing all the work.

How often do you successfully put her to sleep without nursing her?\n\nBecause if she only goes to sleep when she is nursed to sleep and put to bed like that then it is not a fair comparison at all. Of course it's going to be easier for you if she falls asleep easiest when breastfeeding.\n\nYou are both failing at having a proper bed time procedure - at 1 year old, you should be able to put her to bed awake and have her fall asleep.", "NTA. As for your edit OP, I think bringing up \u201cweaponized incompetence\u201d will just put him on the defensive. I\u2019d show him this [webcomic](https://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/) so he has a better understanding of the extra work you\u2019re shouldering without making it sound accusatory", "You can\u2019t just always do something for someone and then cal them lazy for not knowing and/or feeling comfortable how to do the thing!   \n\nIt\u2019s not weaponized incompetence unless you know for a fact that someone is absolutely capable of and comfortable doing the task- you have not ensured that your husband is absolutely capable of and comfortable putting his own daughter to sleep.   \n\nThis is only going to get worse as she gets older.  Nip all this in the bud now by making sure your husband knows how to do everything that you do for her, and not only knows how, but feels comfortable and confident doing it.  Every time you learn something new regarding a better way to deal with her or do something, you have to tell him as well.  You have to be equals if you want an equal!", "NTA. Everyone's right. Its weaponized incompetence. My solution: let him know that you hear and understand his concern, and you want to help. So from now on, he's in charge of bedtime, but you'll give him as much support and encouragement as he needs. From the sidelines. It'll be a bonding experience for him and your child, and you'll be able to rest assured knowing he's got it for next time.", "This. \"Our child is 1 and you'd rather call your mom to parent for you than learn to take care of her?

No one wants to hear an upset baby cry, and your husband can't nurse a baby. If grandma wants to come over and help, let her or stay home the extra half hour. This clingy time is gone so quickly.

But as a mother who nursed for almost 2 years I get it.  My daughter was the same. However if I was out she was fine. If I was home there was no way my husband could put her to bed.

He's never been able to successfully do it bc well she's a nursing toddler.  However I do think you both should practice and maybe you should try to go out a little more.", "ESH.. Perhaps start removing yourself from the bedtime routine a bit. Start slowly adding one activity each week. dad does bath time, then the book reading, then a bottle (or you can nurse), then dad does final settling etc. sometimes it\u2019s not laziness or incompetence but a confidence thing that gets hidden. Especially if dad isn\u2019t around to help out much during the day etc it can be hard to know what to do when your other half just does it easily and naturally. I know you said it\u2019s easier if you do it, but that\u2019s an easy trap for you both to fall into. Let his mum come help for the first few times but you keep going out for him to practice doing it without you. He\u2019ll learn and adjust.", "NTA.  Most parents alternate nights or split duties evenly. Unless he\u2019s picking up the slack for other portions of the day then he needs to be the one to put her to bed every other night. \n\nIt will suck for him and your daughter.  That is only because he\u2019s delayed putting in the work for so long to help her adjust to being familiar with him putting her down. Its his fault for being lazy and a little your fault for enabling the behavior. They\u2019ll both have to suffer, but they\u2019ll get through it.", "NTA. You\u2019re 100% right - he is super lazy and a bad parent for not even trying.", "NTA\n\nThis is weaponized incompetence", "I\u2019m a little late to this, but I\u2019ve got a 1 year old top who used to nurse to sleep. Idk, I feel weird saying this but I also kinda feel for your husband here. Your daughter is gonna be a nightmare to put down sans boob, mine was. One way to think about this is that the overall system isn\u2019t working because nursing to sleep means you are tied to every nap and bedtime - not fair! Ok, so the system is broken. \n\nNTA because he seems fine with the status quo and isn\u2019t taking initiative to be able to take the load off you, but a soft one, because yeah, this is hard. \n\nWhen we hit this point, we ended all nursing to sleep. It was hard, and honestly it meant it was way easier for dad to put her down, bc he didn\u2019t smell like milk. Even until recently when I put our daughter down, she just signs for milk over and over. It\u2019s a hard association to break, and we did it months and months ago now. \n\nSo idk if your husband is being as much of a jerk as everyone is saying. Sleep associations are real, and nursing to sleep means it will be very hard for him to put her down. I think his response of just send in the grandparents majorly sucks. But I feel like this is a good chance to revisit the whole system and come up with a new one. Maybe he does half of bedtimes so she can learn to fall asleep with him without nursing with their own rhythm. Maybe it\u2019s no nursing to sleep. Whatever. But it\u2019s a puzzle for you to solve together, because you now know the current system isn\u2019t working, and you need a new one.", "You're right it does need to be talked about. He's the father, and he should be able to put your child to bed without help. It definitely sounds like weaponized incompetence to me, too. When you talk to him about it I don't think it would be productive to use that phrase. Just bring up your concern that he should be able to do it without help. NTA", "It's also wildly short-sighted of him to use weaponised incompetence or wail for his parents to do basic things that he could muddle through. \n\nWhat happens if OP has an accidental car accident and is away in hospital for some weeks? What happens if OP got a bad bout of flu and really couldn't be looking after children during the day - for the children's sake (a violently infectious person doing close nursing has to be extremely undesirable) as well as her own need of recovery time? Does he really want to be stuck in a situation where his determination to leave everything to his wife means he is unable to provide basic care (for what are *his* children too) in an unexpected emergency?\n\nI'm old but even my own father (born 1915 - no joke), who had been brought up in a very old-fashioned household, was able to do basic household tasks (do enough laundry/baseline cleaning) and feed his children (even if the food was all fried....) when my mum got ill. It's part of emergency planning - what's OP's husband going to do if his wife has an accident when his parents are on holiday? As an independent adult he needs to be able to step up and look after his children. Unless they're wildly rich, he's hardly going to be able to splash out immediately to pay for a cleaner, take-outs to feed the kid(s) and a nanny in such a situation.", "Since OP says either grandmother can put the child to bed successfully, the child doesn't HAVE to nurse to fall asleep.  It is her first preference when available, but when it isn't available, no reason Dad can't learn to manage as well as the grandmothers.", "We all know that he WON\u2019T take responsibility. Her husband is being a lazy asshole.", "She is not even giving him a chance, she is far too controlling.", "She has given him chances. He just has his mother take care of it.
