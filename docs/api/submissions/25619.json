If not, is that a feasible thing to do?\n\n- Show him how much the water bill is and how much you each pay. My impression is that you take care of that and haven't necessarily shown him the figures (granted he should ask). An alternative could be he pays more of the water bill. Could also motivate him to consider alternatives if he can't afford that.\n\nSome alternative suggestions from a person with a bad back who loves a hot as you can stand bath: \n\n- plug in heat pads. Like 20 quid on Amazon etc. Heat up really fast, quick to run, cut off after about 3 hours, but you can just turn off and on again and they start back up. Absolute game changers. You can get different sized/shape ones so you can really target the relevant area (I've got like a little shoulder cape one as my shoulders are bad sometimes) and they generally strap around you\n\n- ibuprofen gel for pain relief. I can't take ibuprofen tablets but the gel really does work well. \n\n- you can probably get water temperature things you can put in the bath as you run it, if he's struggling to judge it right. I run mine as I about 2/3 fill the bath just with hot, then top off with cold while I'm in the bathroom so I stop the cold as soon as I can just get in it.

I'm a thrifty person, mostly because waste just doesn't make sense, logically, and *it's so easy* \nAll this first-world entitlement despite everything we know, all the messages out there about energy and water usage, the environment and the climate.  And these morons are ignoring all that, plus going to work to earn money, then pouring it down the drain. No gain, no pleasure, just complete unthinking stupidity.", "Yep, this is what I do, sit in there while it fills and move the water around a bit to mix it well when making adjustments.  And if I didn't have a mixer tap (OP is in the UK, so they likely have separate hot and cold water taps), it's *definitely* what I'd do.", "He's not running the cold tap at all.  You know, that thing 99.9% of people with access to indoor plumbing do to run a bath, regulating the temperature.", "It does matter.  Yes, there will be some electrical or gas expense even if the water is never used, but those bills are higher when more is used.\n\nWater heaters are well-insulated, they don't lose a lot of heat just standing there - this is why they're so cool to the touch.  New water coming in is *cold.*  It doesn't need a quick top-off of heat every now and then like water which has already been heated, it needs to be heated all at once to the set temperature from a cold starting temperature, then the heater moves into maintaining its temperature.  When using hot water, you're causing a refill which triggers more first-time heatings.\n\nHe's using the same total water (ignoring the small evaporation), so water expense is the same, but he's using significantly more *hot* water, so gas or electric expense rises.\n\nHe could use maybe half as much hot water (meaning only half as much needs to be newly heated) combined with cold water to get to the same temperature for the bath that he's currently waiting for.\n\nOP also can and probably should see about reducing the thermostat on the heater a bit.  If it's currently 60C it could be dropped to 49C to save not only on BF's bath habits but a bit on maintenance heat as well.  If it's currently at 71C it should definitely be reduced.", "No, just most of them based on estimates from 5 yrs ago. Any extra, I absorb.", "Get a bath thermometer maybe (or make him get one!). I got one for my baby but found it so handy for my own baths too. If he argues with the numbers on the thermometer, then it\u2019s not about him wanting the right temperature, he\u2019s just being a wasteful AH", "I feel ya , currently teaching my partner that we don\u2019t need to fill a whole kettle for two cups of tea. It\u2019s taking longer than I thought..", "Look he very well may not *be* stupid overall, but on this subject specifically he is *being* stupid.  And at this point, stubbornly so.", "I\u2019m going to reduce the heat on the thermostat. Usually I like talking things through and trying to understand each other but I\u2019m too old for that nonsense. It\u2019s like trying to communicate with someone with a hole in the science corner of their brain. So I\u2019m planning to just inhibit his ability to annoy me!", "But water heaters are well-insulated. A maintenance heat cycle is not at all the same as first-time heating of freshly filled cold water in the tank.", "Sure there\u2019s a cost, because if you empty the hot water tank more than necessary it is going to run longer than that cycle normally requires to heat the extra cold water he introduces to the system.", "I sing that when I'm filling the kids paddling pool! \ud83c\udfb6so I must go to fetch the water, til the day that I am grown\ud83c\udfb6", ">It is tricky to mix hot and cold water so that you get an as-hot-as-you-can-stand bath.\n\nIt's not though, not for anyone with the competency of a person over about the age of 13", "He doesn\u2019t though. He runs a bath, then wanders off for an hour, apparently having deep thoughts while gazing out the living room window. I can do all my morning ablutions and more. He doesn\u2019t mind me using the bathroom for the entire time he is waiting for the bath to cool", "https://youtu.be/Ta1mzaqOp4Q?feature=shared"]}
