My impression is that you take care of that and haven't necessarily shown him the figures (granted he should ask). An alternative could be he pays more of the water bill. Could also motivate him to consider alternatives if he can't afford that.\n\nSome alternative suggestions from a person with a bad back who loves a hot as you can stand bath: \n\n- plug in heat pads. Like 20 quid on Amazon etc. Heat up really fast, quick to run, cut off after about 3 hours, but you can just turn off and on again and they start back up. Absolute game changers. You can get different sized/shape ones so you can really target the relevant area (I've got like a little shoulder cape one as my shoulders are bad sometimes) and they generally strap around you\n\n- ibuprofen gel for pain relief. I can't take ibuprofen tablets but the gel really does work well. \n\n- you can probably get water temperature things you can put in the bath as you run it, if he's struggling to judge it right. I run mine as I about 2/3 fill the bath just with hot, then top off with cold while I'm in the bathroom so I stop the cold as soon as I can just get in it.

He is being extremely foolish.", "I'd be in hot water if I ever did this growing up.", "I'm confused here is he just letting it run down the drain or is he just filling up and taking an hour long bath?", "NTA Try offering to fix a bath for him. Then, when he sees it can actually work, he'll get it.", "NTA\nYou could turn the temp of your hot water down at the boiler or invest in a thermostatic tap so that he can set the temperature he wants.\nI'd be doing the first so he doesn't know it's cooler", "NTA\nIf you have a smart meter, show him the day-to-day impact of one of those baths on the bill.", "If I was going to do this, the only reason is that adding cold water, can create pockets of cold, and letting the water cool a bit mean I'd loose heat gradually, maybe tell him to try being in the bath whilst it's running then he can tune it where it should be.", "Why not run a test, ask him to do it your way for one month so you can see if there are any savings on the next bill.  If there are he must agree to pay you the difference or use a mix or hit and cold. You might be correct that it's chewing up money bit what if the difference is 2 pounds and you've been so upset over only 2 pounds. The fact is neither of you really know the actual cost. So find out first.", "NTA -Have you guys tried heat pads and hot water bottles to help with his pain? They really help my friend with her bad back. I'd definitely say it sounds like maybe his mental health has declined a bit, have you tried to talk to him about how he is feeling when not in mid-argument?", "NTA - is he literally so stupid that he thinks it doesn\u2019t cost more money to heat a full 380 litres up to 70 degrees centigrade and let it cool to 40 and then use it than it does to ONLY heat half that and mix it with cold from the mains and use straight away. It literally costs almost twice as much per bath.", "NTA. So I have a back injury, and I\u2019m currently pregnant with baby number 3. You can imagine that my lower back & hips are pretty freaking uncomfortable these days. \n\nI like a magnesium bath to help with the discomfort, but I run the bath at the right temperature and hop straight in. I don\u2019t want to waste any time in which I could be experiencing relief from the pain. I\u2019m mindful that I\u2019m also not using up all the hot water before my husband & kids can have baths or showers. So if the water is cooling down a bit, I will get my husband to boil the kettle/pot to top up the tub.", "It wouldn't be ok even if he was the one paying the bills. It's just stupid.", "NTA\n\nYour bf does not have a different view on physics, he is too lazy to do something sensible because he doesn't pay for it. \n\nYour bf is behaving like a brat.", "I have really bad arthritis and a few slipped disks in my neck and spine. The pain to stand up straight when it flairs is a bad a kidney stones and there's days i can't feel my fingers and toes from the arthritis so, I know what he's going though but i can understand you as well. \n\n  There are some better ways of treatment for him.  Heating pads work great but, sun rooms help the most during the day. That warm light does wonders.  Also most chairs only aggravates the pain more with the poor posture they provide us in the way we sit. Just have him look up other ways that are out there. That's what i did.  Shit in the fall and spring i sit out with a fire pit blaring my God does that feel good.  I sleep better afterwards too! I have a friend who has extreme eczema who has this light box contraption her husband built her with uv lights she sits in to treat it.  She she uses it more now after she hurt her back in a car accident then she did before.", "NTA. That is just stupid behavior and a waste of energy and of course costly. He should just get the temperature down to something which doesn't burn him right from the start and get in at once.", "I would turn the boiler water output Temp down if it's a combi then he wouldn't have to wait so long and you would use less gas", "I was going to say you were definitely the AH, financially but when I think about it that\u2019s not an unreasonable request. Why would he run the tub at its hottest if he can\u2019t actually handle sitting in it? He can literally set the water to be the temp he can handle.", "It's easy not to care when someone doesn't pay for it.  Ask nicely if he wants to start splitting on the utilities, at least. Especially considering the rise in cost of living.", "NTA. He either pays the gas or electric bill fully depending on the type of water heater you have or he acts like a normal person and runs a bath while adjusting the temperature as you go so you can get into the tub without waiting an hour", "Info- Is he on the spectrum or does he have any OCD tendencies?", "Why do only you pay the bills? Time to get him to ante up and pay his way. \n\nI have a bad back - baths are grossly unhygienic and a real waste of money, so I ditched mine years ago and now have a walk-in shower. When I need extra support for my back pain, I stand in the shower for an extra few minutes with the jet of water just focused on the painful area. Then I take paracetamol, and prepare a hot water bottle. It hardly adds to the electric bill and, even more importantly, it helps manage the pain. \n\nIf he wants to continue with expensive and inconsiderate behaviour, he needs to pay for it. He is direspecting you and showing you he doesn't care about your opinion. NTA, but don't let this selfish attitude continue.", "NTA\n\nHe's not changing because you've just been asking him to change. He knows he can just let you yell at him and then it'll be over and he can take his long bath anyway.\n\nAt this point, you're asking him to stop with the bathing is way more than just that. You're asking him to give you basic respect and for him to treat you as a human being. Him choosing to continue with the bathing is him saying that his wants are more important than yours. He's making a conscious choice to do it.\n\nYou've gotta teach people how they teach you to treat them. Your BF is showing you that he doesn't care about what you think or want. He refuses to communicate. If he refuses to communicate, you're either turning the water off or putting locks on the bathroom door. \n\nI'd dump him by now tbh.", "NTA. He can pay for the water bills if he really wants the hot water that much. Surely that\u2019s more than fair?", "The most supported explanation is that hot water evaporates faster, so it has a smaller volume to freeze.", "Of get him out, also a valid option.", "https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/exactly-how-much-running-bath-28908613\n\n>Running a bath - 87p cost per single-use\n\nSo $1.09, though that should be a normal bath where someone is not filling the bath with hot water alone. So a bath of the BF should cost closer to $2.", "He is a moron.", "Would a moist heating pad or an extra large hot water bottle be an option? You are NTA, btw, but I also have a bad back...so I understand. I do a ton of stretches, because my condition can be alleviated by that (I know this won't work for all), and have a heating pad that I can dampen the cover for and use for a wet heat. Although, since the heating pad requires electric, it may not be the best option either.", "Well... having no comprehension of basic science is what puts one in the \"not so smart\" category. Make him pay for it and then maybe he'll start understanding basic economics.", "Um, he IS stupid.  This is a concept a 4 year old could understand.", "Just buy him a bath thermometer - the kind you buy for newborns' bathing. So he can check the temperature of water he likes most and the next time try to fill the bathtub the way so the water has the desired temperature.", "Hmm, do you think you could persuade him to run the bath using hot and cold water for a single month and then show him the difference in the gas bill?", "I could not live with that.  It would drive me mental.", "Roommate isn't wrong.  Look up Newton's Law of Cooling.  Cooling rates are different for things that start at wider temperatures.  Also look up the Mpemba effect, which explains this paradox at lot more than.", "I thought this too till I dated a physics major in college. Your roommate is correct bro. I know it blew my mind too.", "The boyfriend is objectively wrong and wasteful, and is deaf to reason. It's not petty for OP to be frustrated at his lack of communication and waste of her money.", "I live in a desert, and the water waste is seriously killing me inside.", "Maybe he sees the question as an accusation.  Or maybe you're hoping for a one-sentence answer he isn't prepared to give.  Or maybe you don't accept his answer as \"clear.\"  Or maybe you're the type of person who feels that the Socratic approach is the way to get the bottom of this, but to him it's just dismissing him and telling him he's wrong.\n\nI'm not saying any or all that is necessarily true, but I could think of many reasons a person would do such a thing and many reasons another person would think that it's wasteful and crazy.  And this might be less a crazy boyfriend people than a communication style problem.", "Is the tub thick cast iron? Has he complained about wanting to warm the tub up first too? Only logical reason I could see but even then, 10 min max to heat up.", "The Mpemba effect is thus far unexplained, has been difficult to replicate in experiments with more specific measuring techniques, and is not widely accepted in the field. \n\nThe most supported explanation is that hot water evaporates quicker, so it's a smaller volume to freeze. Nobody has been able to replicate the experiment when you *end* with the same volume of water", "Your physics major ex is incorrect. This all stems from a lone and thus far unreproducible experiment.", "I can vouch for the heat pads they are a heaven sent item for my chronic pain I use mine daily and have had it almost 4 years it feels like a warm hug when I'm anxious too to double benefit good luck resolving this issue.", "Trick is to just do your best to 90% full.  At that point you can go all hot if you are worried it won\u2019t be hot enough, and it will be plenty hot, but also worst cast just a few degrees over.", "My go to is filling it half with warm not hot water, then get in and add hot water till I reach the ideal temp.", "or like add hot water then add cold/warm water\nand mix?", "No, it\u2019s plastic", "Exactly.  It\u2019s not some law of physics.  It\u2019s a weird POSSIBLE edge case where sometime in some conditions hot water seems to freeze faster.\n\nBut it\u2019s 100% not a law to the degree where using hot water in your ice cube tray makes any sense.", "But then he'd have to wait a little bit before...\n\nNevermind."]}
