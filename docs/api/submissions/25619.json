Does your boyfriend understand how water taps work? You mix the cold and hot water to get the desired temperature. It's absurd to run a bath, empty the hot water tank, wait for the water to cool down and pay to refill he tank and reheat the water.

Whether that be sitting in the bathroom longer than needed, letting a cup of tea brew for a minute or two longer or just finding those small excuses to not be bothered by people as I struggle to get time to fully switch off. This could be the case for your boyfriend. \n\nI\u2019m not suggesting that he wants to be away from you necessarily, but depending on how stressful his life is he might need that complete switch off, and so this bath thing gives him an excuse to be \u2018busy\u2019 in the way that no-one will ask him to do anything whilst not actually needing to do anything. Particularly if he\u2019s struggling at all. Us blokes are awful at expressing emotion, especially here in the UK, and a lot of us find it easier to have a shit excuse to be left alone than having a conversation with the Mrs explaining that we\u2019re too stressed and need to be alone for a minute. \n\nYou are NTA either way, but perhaps this has a deeper reason than him just being a bit thick.", "I'm so confused. If he wants cold water why not just fill it with cold water? \n\nNTA unless he discovered some new water physics.", "NTA. Fellow UK Redditor here. The cost of living crisis here is astonishing and the fact that your boyfriend is costing you money for something easily remedied is so unfair. Why isn't he contributing towards the bills?

My cousin is on the spectrum - it's not pronounced and she's very clever...except...she'll wait for her hair to air dry after a shower...then hours later, will proceed to blow dry it for a minimum of 20 minutes. It's not to style it, she just points it at her head. I imagine it's some sort of self soothing routine.", "Do you own your home or rent an apartment?

Then fill the kettle to the 2 litre mark with cold water to show him that he will get his 2 litres of water at the desired temperature (45C) in less time. \n\nHowever, I think this is simply a bad habit of him rather than not understanding this.

It's because there is a lag between when you adjust the knobs, and when the bath temperature adjusts, and I find the waiting for it to adjust hard and always overcorrect, and always overcorrect wrong, so I wind up with a lukewarm tub. The literal only two ways I have ever found to have a fully hot tub is to run the hot water straight, then 1) add cold water until it is hot enough that it hurts to sit down, whereupon I swirl and it's fine, or 2) leave it straight and let it cool. However, the first method requires you to be pretty agile, as it's easy to fuck it up and need to leap out of the tub quickly lest you get scalded. If he has physical issues he may not want to do that.   \n\n\nA possible solution would be to have you fill the tub to a reasonable water temperature if you're good at it and it annoys you?", "NTA\n\nIf he wants to run baths like this he should be the one paying the bills, i don\u2019t understand the logic here just add cold water and then you dont have to wait for it to cool down", "Ok, NTA. I actually use this method because I have a tank, which is heated and as it runs, it tops up the tank with cold so you end up with this weird horrible tepid water for the rest of the day & need to use the booster.\n\n\nSo I just have it run hot, I can tolerate very hot as it relaxed my muscles and it's usually running cold after the tub is 1/3 full, so it ends up at a decent temperature anyway.\n\n\nBut he's just running it and then not getting in...

This is going to sound patronising but have you tried literally spelling it out for him? Like write the maths down on a piece of paper.

That matches up with my real life experience too. That all means at most the bill is going to be about 130% of what it would otherwise be.\n\nThat is wasted money, but its nothing like triple the usual cost.", "I have tried to explain but keep on hitting a brick wall. \nYou may be right about there being some ritual around it but I think he just gets distracted with other things and then defensive when I point it out.", "Thankyou, but I\u2019m not going to dump him over this.

I can't afford the cost of the way you run them. It also means I can't use the bathroom for hours at a time too, which isn't workable. \n\nCan we come up with some alternatives?\"\n\n- hopefully addressing it as a team will help get past any defensiveness which may be what the feeling like you're talking to a brick wall is coming from. I red your comment below about him being worried about work about this, so I think approaching it in a \"I want to help, let's tackle this together\" way is probably the one I would go with. \n\n- is he seeing a doctor/physio/chiro? If not, is that a feasible thing to do?\n\n- Show him how much the water bill is and how much you each pay. My impression is that you take care of that and haven't necessarily shown him the figures (granted he should ask). An alternative could be he pays more of the water bill. Could also motivate him to consider alternatives if he can't afford that.\n\nSome alternative suggestions from a person with a bad back who loves a hot as you can stand bath: \n\n- plug in heat pads. Like 20 quid on Amazon etc. Heat up really fast, quick to run, cut off after about 3 hours, but you can just turn off and on again and they start back up. Absolute game changers. You can get different sized/shape ones so you can really target the relevant area (I've got like a little shoulder cape one as my shoulders are bad sometimes) and they generally strap around you\n\n- ibuprofen gel for pain relief. I can't take ibuprofen tablets but the gel really does work well. \n\n- you can probably get water temperature things you can put in the bath as you run it, if he's struggling to judge it right. I run mine as I about 2/3 fill the bath just with hot, then top off with cold while I'm in the bathroom so I stop the cold as soon as I can just get in it. You have to stir the water round to properly distribute the cold water though, i use the handle of one of those long handled loofahs I bought when I had surgery and couldn't reach my back for a few months.\n\nHopefully this helps!", "If he's running up higher bills for no good reason then it's 5 years passed time he start paying more.

We use way less water & gas than most households of similar size and uts been really helpful to have those trends - esp when the gas co tries to tell me my monthly DD needs to be increased cos they're just concerned I'm not accidentally underpaying and it's fine, if there's a surplus by April they'll refund \ud83d\ude44 Yeah, nope \ud83e\udd23\n\nAnyway, my point is, do you have your old bills, or some companies will even show you a little graph of your usage in your online accounts. If you can show him how your household usage hasn't changed in the last 5 years but the cost is now double or whatever, it might help??
