So I (f26) have been seeing my bf (29m) for about a year. For reference, he had a bit of a tricky upbring. His mum ran off when he was about 6, and then his dad looked after him for a year but was doing such a terrible job. The house was falling apart quite literally as he purchased a cheap 'diy' house, but then didn't do the diy. There were cigarette butts everywhere and my bf looked like he would go into the care system. Agast, his grandparents swooped him to raise him. They did overall a decent job, only they are quite conservative. My bf is quite liberal, although still on a little bit of a learning journey because of it. This is all quite important as because of the way he was raised, he's always felt he owes them, even though it isn't a narrative they have pushed. He worries what would have happened if he ended up in the care system.  \nBecause of this, he wanted to wait a little bit extra before I met them, as wanted to show them that this was more than a fling. Fine with me, I've been in no rush. A couple of weeks ago, he mentioned whether I would be interested in coming over for Sunday lunch (this is UK, so it was your standard roast).   \nMe and my bf are really into our gaming and anime, it's how we first met. I'm not really into fashion, or going out. I'm certainly not a girly girl and my wardrobe reflects that. Pumps and trainers instead of heels, bf jumpers that I can snuggle up in, and then just loads of shirts that represent what I am into. Last year in particular we really got into elden ring and my bf bought me an Elden ring t shirt for my birthday which I thought I would wear. So this was one of the first things they saw once I had taken off my jumper.  I guess I didn't think much about it because I know I am nice person, and that's what they would want to get to know, not what I was wearing.  \nI thought the lunch went well enough. They were a little cold to me, but I thought that was just because they were protective of him. I went home, but he stayed the night with them.   \nThe next day when I went over to his flat, he was struggling to communicate. Finally got it out of him and he said I hadn't made a great impression because of what I was wearing. The t shirt revealed that I do have tattoos on my arms (again more references to gaming) and I also had my piercings in (multiple ear piercings, nothing else).   \nHe gently, but firmly, said that I should have worn something a little bit nicer and appropriate for them, and that he had spent all evening trying to convince them that I am a good and wholesome person. But they are really stubborn and stuck in their ways, and their approval means so much to him. He said it's gonna take a long time for them to come round from this.  \nSo AITA for wearing what I feel comfortable and presenting myself as me, or should I have worn something more conservative even though I would not be comfortable in it?", "created_utc": 1679640533, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120bwyj/aita_for_not_allowing_my_boyfriends_grandparents/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They also arent policing your outfit - it doesnt sound like they really did anything to you. \n\nBut really at 26 meeting your BFs \u201cparents\u201d you should have put in a little more effort than a graphic tee if you wanted to make a good impression.", "Sorry to say it, but YTA.\n\nDressing appropriately is part of being an adult. It would have been respectful to dress up a little bit when meeting your partner\u2019s parents.\n\nThere is a time and a place for gaming T shirts and baggy jumpers. First time meeting the parents is not that time.", "ESH \nYou can wear what you want, but they can react to it like they want. Its bullshit to say appearances dont affect first impressions. If he is your person, and you know what his grandparents are like, why guarantee an issue. Youre not claiming you were attached to your outfit, or opposed to something else, judt thst this is how yiu normaly dress. Why make the relationship with his famil harder from the word go....why put him in that position.\nThey should not be so judgmental and look to your charachter not you clothes. \nHe should have asked.", "YTA. There was a post yesterday portraing the same exact situation. You already know they were conservative, and how much they mean to him. You should have put more thought into it. I think there are ways to dress nice without go full barbie.", "NTA, but also soft YTA. \n\nNo, you shouldn\u2019t have to hide who you are as a person (tattoos, piercings, etc.) but a first meeting of your SO\u2019s family isn\u2019t the place for graphic tees and \u201ccomfy\u201d clothes. Not saying you have to be full princess or anything, but a nice top and pants with flats or low-tops will go a lot further for your first impression.", "YTA. You\u2019re 26 and by now you should know that not all your outfits are supposed to represent what you are into. \n\nWould you wear an Elden ring t-shirt to a job interview? How about a funeral? There\u2019s a time and place. \n\nYou should have worn less casual clothes to meet his grandparents, especially since you already knew that they are conservative and that your bf cares about them. \n\nI don\u2019t think they were trying to police your outfits at all, since they didn\u2019t comment on your clothes or ask you to change. You just made a bad first impression.", "NTA, and it wasn't about the clothes. The grandparents clearly don't think much of tatts or piercings on women.", "NTA. Be comfortable. Be who you are. Your boyfriend and his grandparents can take it or leave it. Too bad.", "Dress to impress", "NTA - if what you were wearing was inappropriate, your BF should have told you before. Actually, he could have made suggestions if it were that important. He probably didn't realize that the GP would make such an issue out of it. BTW, what was he wearing? As for the tattoos and piercings, they would find out eventually. Best not to try and hide stuff like that.  Eventually, they will come around and see you for who you are on the inside, not the outside.\n\nJust an FYI, when meeting someone important to your SO, you might want to dress more business-casual rather than just casual. Maybe ask if you appearance will be important to the host(s). Just a thought. While it really shouldn't matter, first impressions are important. Hard to undo a bad one. Good Luck!!", "NTA. You showed up as yourself. I can\u2019t believe your boyfriend has the nerve to tell you to tone yourself down/ change. Your clothes, tattoos, etc don\u2019t matter. They should love you coz he does. He shouldn\u2019t be excusing their behaviour here and putting it on you. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you were treated poorly luv. Be yourself, you sound awesome as you are", "Soft YTA. \n\nGenerally, when you meet family for the first time, you want to put your best foot forward. Dressing up a bit shows that you understand this is important to your partner and that you are aware that there are different clothes for different zones. \n\nThere are plenty of dressy items out there that reflect your love for gaming. Nowadays, us gamers are a little spoilt for choice when it comes to showing our passions and doing it in style (whatever that is for you). So switching to a a collared shirt with a nice pattern, wearing some cool earrings with your favourite sigil, or if you really want to go for it, a mid length skirt with some nice tights underneath. \n\nThe main thing is, sometimes we have to dress a little differently from how we normally do. Dressing up a bit doesn\u2019t deny who you are, it expands. Viewing it as a problem instead of a challenge will set you up for a lot of stress.", "YTA. \n\nFirst time meeting the parents is not the day for your favorite T-shirt. If you can, match the level your partner is dressing for the event. \n\nI\u2019m a comfort over fashion person, to the extreme. I never wear heels and if I can get away with pjs I will. (I married into a family that does formal wear for Christmas which takes away one of my die hard \u201cpjs all day\u201d days) \n\nMeet the parents is still a nice sweater and slacks, with flats not trainers. If you don\u2019t have a nice shell/blouse to go under the sweater, pick a couple up and hang them in the closet for emergencies. \n\nI discovered tailored cotton knit dresses and I consider it a cheat - they look great because they fit better than off the rack, and the soft fabric is comfy and can be washed like a t shirt. \n\nYou don\u2019t need high fashion, you don\u2019t need heels and a dress. You do need to show that you have dressed for the occasion for some occasions.", "NTA\n\nIf he knew their standards would be different than what you usually wear, and their approval means so much, he should have let you know about that beforehand (not told you what to wear, but let you know).\n\nObviously, there's nothing wrong with tatts and piercings and most people have got that memo by now. \n\nYour bf shouldn't be blaming you for them having standards that he himself knows are silly, because obviously he is quite fine with tatts and piercings and elden ring tshirts, so he should be pushing back on their judgement, or at least recognise that he can set it aside when it's so superficial, not telling you you should have dressed differently.", "YTA. There\u2019s a time and place for everything.  You\u2019re an adult and need to understand that not every item of clothing needs to represent what your hobbies and interests. The world doesn\u2019t need to know about your interest in gaming.", "Personally if I were meeting the elderly grandparents of a partner for the first time I'd have put in a bit of effort. But I'm a bit older so. NTA but you should probably think a bit more in future.", "NTA\n\nI can see where your BF is coming from in some ways, the whole \u2018dressing up for first meetings\u2019 thing, so I don\u2019t think he\u2019s TA either, but you definitely NTA.\n\nYou are who you are, you dressed appropriate to who you are, as you have every right to.\nWould your BF have preferred you lie to them?? That would have been a *great* first impression.\n\nHis grandparents need to learn to accept people for who they are, *they* are TA here.", "So, are you the AH for wearing something comfortable? = NO!\n\nShould you have worn something more conservative to meet his grandparents? = Errr...\n\nThe answer to the second question should also have been a resounding NO but sometimes in life, we have to make compromises, especially for people we are close to.\n\nThe miserable reality is that we are always judged for our appearance and fantasy t-shirts and tattoos are often likely to be vexatious to the spirit of people of a certain... mindset. This is made more difficult by the emotional closeness your BF has to his grandparents. We all like to please those we are close to.\n\nMaybe next time, and it depends how much you think of your boyfriend, put on a drab long-sleeved frock and sensible shoes when visiting his grandparents and change back into your normal gear when you get in the car.\n\nShould you have to do it? No, but...\n\nI desperately want to say that you are N T A because I truly feel as you: the person should be judged, not the clothes they wear. However, I reluctantly have to go for NAH", "NTA\n\nWhat? A T-shirt is absolutely fine for a sunday home lunch and your tattoos are going to be there and apart of you no matter what you wear so hiding them wouldn't have solved anything. Ear piercings are PERFECTLY fine in this day and age, even for guys.", "NTA - it might have been better if you 2 had communicated more before you went to know what they\u2019re like about topics (tattoos etc) as some ppl can be judgy on first impressions.. but you aren\u2019t an AH .. bf should have mentioned this to you tbh so you\u2019d understand..", "Sounds like a him and them problem and not yours.", "NTA.  Ask them (or have your bf ask them) why wouldn't they judge you on your behavior instead of your clothing? That's ridiculous. Better yet, why do they not trust your bf's judgement? After all, *they* raised him!", "NTA if they want to judge you off wearing a T-shirt and having tattoos rather than who you are then they aren\u2019t very nice people. If they won\u2019t take the time to actually know you then it won\u2019t matter what you wear, would he expect you to dress up every time so that you can be deemed acceptable in their eyes? It\u2019s not like you rocked up with cleavage out or an offensive shirt, they need to get over themselves. He\u2019s embarrassed by you more than he\u2019s willing to defend you and I wouldn\u2019t stand for that. I have bright hair and tattoos, is it everyone\u2019s cup of tea? No. However, my husband would never let parts of his conservative family cast judgement on me purely off wearing a baggy T-shirt and having tattoo. Obviously they said something to him, I\u2019d imagine they made not very nice comments about you to him and his response was to blame you inoffensive clothes instead of saying \u201chey pack it in, don\u2019t judge people off their clothes, that\u2019s really shallow and really not a nice thing to do. How would you like it if people judged you like that?\u201d\n\nHeck even if you had dressed up that time then the next time you wear stuff you\u2019re comfortable in are you suddenly going to turn into a bad person in their eyes? No? Then they need to get over themselves.", "NTA then he should be dating someone his grandparents introduced him to at their church, or social club, and not trying to change you. He has people pleasing issues and if he is constantly looking for their approval in his relationships, they will never work out. However, meeting the parents for the first time requires more than a graphic t shirt. It should be a collared shirt or dressier top like for an office, or business meeting. I dont think covering tattoos, or taking out piercings though. As they would be there for later meetings anyway.", "Nta. \nI hate conservatives that judge people based on what they wear. Its becoming more and more common in nearly every first world country to have piercings and tattoos. \nThey are behind the times. You were definitely not in the wrong.", "NTA. Never ever ever give in to the conservative. Or you'll end up like Nazi Germany, or Modi's India or 2023 Florida.", "NTA --- I once saw a statement that I think is very apt right here, Some of the nicest people I have ever met were covered in tattoos and piercings some of the meanest bigots I have ever met go to church every Sunday.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
