I noticed the fish smell instantly. \n\nI immediately went to the kitchen and told the person cooking the fish to get that shit out of my house. And reminded everyone of my food allergy. A lot of the other people there were already eating some of the fish so now my whole house is contaminated with fish because people were touching everywhere. \n\nThe guy gave me some BS excuse \"Oh you told me a month ago about your allergy you should've reminded  people\" I then told him that I sent out a text 2 days ago to everyone reminding them & he said he didn't get it. Yeah sure.\n\nAnyway, at this point I was panicking because I did not have my Epipen in case I get a severe allergic reaction. Also, I ate some of the food that was being cooked in my kitchen, Food contamination with the fish was likely. \n\n I kicked everyone out of my party, even though it was still early in the evening, and I had invited them all over to celebrate. A lot of them travelled far but at this point I did not care. \n\nSome of the guests got pissed off saying I could just get rid of the fish & they all could wash their hands & I could just chill outside until the fish smell went away. I told them to fuck off & that they can all blame David for almost killing me. They thought I was overreacting. Which I probably was because again, I was pissed off. I was yelling at this point.  \n\nA lot of my friends said that I ruined the party because I overreacted because I did not have to kick everyone out of the party since they did not bring the fish.

Ask whether they can safely just avoid the dish, or how to mitigate potential issues.\n\nIf someone else brings the allergen into the picture, you don't need to name and shame, but at least inform them to discard it and help to limit any contamination.. DO NOT ignore the allergy and partake in the food.\n\nMy sister is unfortunate enough to have a severe reaction to Latex and cannot attend birthday parties with latex balloons because the simple act of inflating them spreads latex particles through the air.

Get better friends love", "NTA", "NTA. You had a valid reason to panic and kick people out for your safety.", "Massive NTA, David could have killed you, and your friends think it\u2019s no big deal", "NTA, I would send the guests a very explicit description of all the things that could happen if you have an allergic reaction. David and your friends are AH for not taking your allergy seriously.", "nta. there only reason i'd resist leaving in those circumstances is bc i would worry about leaving you alone with the allergens, much less trying to clean up alone", "None of these people are your friends\n\nMove on and find better people\n\nNTA", "Also \"you told me a month ago\". How does he know when  it was, when he forget that OP had the allergy?! So he knew EXACTLY that the allergy exists and even when he was told the first time. What an AH. And all the people who ate the fish or saw him cooking... they knew of the allergy vecause they got the notification and they knew it would risk OPs health/life and not one said a word, just telling OP \"hey, i just want you to let know this guy brought some fish and want to cook it.\" They are ALL shitty friends. \n\nAnd they have no understanding that the party is over because OP must do damage control and isn\u2019t in the mood to party anymore?! Nobody offered to help to clean. What a selfish pack.", "NONE of the people who complained were his friends.", "Also\u2026 who the hell brings fish to a party?! \u201cYou know what would go great with this Gin & Tonic? **FISH!!!!**\u201d", "This. A party would have been more than ruined if OP dropped dead from anaphylaxis.", ">You know what else would be ruining the party? You going in to anaphylactic shock in front of everybody because you accidentally ate something contaminated with fish\n\nWith 'friends' as selfish as this lot, I imagine they'd keep partying on even if the OP was on the floor struggling to breathe.", "As someone who had allergies as well, I\u2019d go ballistic too. No, you are not just washing your hands you are scrubbing the whole damned house. David ruined the damned party.\n\nAnaphylactic shock isn\u2019t fun. I don\u2019t recommend it. NTA", "Honestly, I believe this is on purpose. I don't know ANYONE who thinks \"gee, you know what this party needs? Some cooked fish.\" NO.\n\nI know people sometimes bring cold shrimp or crab, but fish to be cooked? That's not an accident. \n\nShit, when I have a party, someone might bring taco dip and devilled eggs, but usually I end up with 10 bags of chips.", "An asshole who doesn't think food allergies are real and did it on purpose?", "Probably the same AH who was microwaving catfish at work.", "NTA. Heck I always thought it rude to bring food that has to be cooked without at least discussing it with the host", "Even if it's not an allergy, who would do this?? What a strange person.", "Oh gosh, yes. They all suck as friends. Sent them information on how allergies work. Then new friends.", "Yeah, I was thinking for a moment \"It is kind of an asshole thing to throw out everybody because one guy fucked up\" but then again, they all fucked up by not even saying something.", "the guests should have been offering to stay to help clean, not getting mad they couldn't keep partying.", "I know people who don't have one because they can't afford one", "I get that it's irresponsible, but it's also super expensive. Epipens are about $700 even generic is around $350. Not all insurances cover them and with deductibles you'll probably have to pay for the whole thing out of pocket anyways. And frankly a large portion of the US are working poor.", "Irresponsible or just a product of the American healthcare \"system\"? My husband doesn't have an EpiPen anymore for his bee allergy and we have to redo his allergy testing to get a new prescription and then pay for the overpriced EpiPen for him. It's ridiculous. We're doing it, but if we couldn't afford it I wouldn't say we're irresponsible, just in poverty.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates [Rule 1: Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). Further incidents may result in a ban.\n\n[\"Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_civility)\n\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "That's what gets me. If I had seen fish in this circumstance, a string of expletives would fly out of my mouth at the bringer of the allergen.", "I have one of those allergies that I am not anywhere close to deathly allergic. But unlike most people I treat everyone else\u2019s as deadly unless I am told otherwise. It\u2019s not that hard to respect a person\u2019s allergy. I really don\u2019t understand people like \u201cDavid\u201d that OP knows.", "Thank you - I cannot get over bringing uncooked fish to a party. \"What'll I bring to John's birthday? A bottle of wine? Maybe a dessert to pass? This raw trout? Ah yes, that's the ticket!\"\n\nObviously not the most major issue here, but a noteworthy secondary problem!", ">Would they see you collapse and leave you to sleep it off, not realising every second counts?\n\nOmg, this is exactly what I was thinking.\nIf she had gone into anaphylaxis, would any of them noticed or know what to do?  Or would they just figure she could sleep it off - and my guess is the latter!", "That is completely valid and I am sorry I didn\u2019t consider poverty. There is a generic brand epipen that is still an auto inject that is less expensive that you can ask for. I do hope that op is able to get an epipen for her peace of mind.", "OP could have cleaned again after their friends had cleaned. It\u2019s much easier to clean up after everything is cleared off, so it would still have saved OP time. More importantly, OP wouldn\u2019t have ruined their own night, and could have continued to have a good time outside."]}
