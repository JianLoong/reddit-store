Ask whether they can safely just avoid the dish, or how to mitigate potential issues.\n\nIf someone else brings the allergen into the picture, you don't need to name and shame, but at least inform them to discard it and help to limit any contamination.. DO NOT ignore the allergy and partake in the food.\n\nMy sister is unfortunate enough to have a severe reaction to Latex and cannot attend birthday parties with latex balloons because the simple act of inflating them spreads latex particles through the air.
