Ask whether they can safely just avoid the dish, or how to mitigate potential issues.\n\nIf someone else brings the allergen into the picture, you don't need to name and shame, but at least inform them to discard it and help to limit any contamination.. DO NOT ignore the allergy and partake in the food.\n\nMy sister is unfortunate enough to have a severe reaction to Latex and cannot attend birthday parties with latex balloons because the simple act of inflating them spreads latex particles through the air.

I never used to have allergies, but I developed them while living with my granny. She didn't believe me when I told her something was wrong with my body, and I couldn't sleep cuz my throat felt tight. Took a couple of hospital visits and her yelling at me when I asked my Aunt to take me to the hospital for them to confirm that yes I have allergies and yes my throat was starting to close. Mom got soon pissed at granny (her mom). That I know to listen to my own body and that I don't make this stuff up. Granny was like well I didn't know. No shit, you ask and believe your granddaughter and not yell at her. Just cuz a doctor didn't confirm doesn't mean you don't take it seriously and I thank God my immediate fam (2 bros and mom) listen to me and accommodate me or give me a heads up so I can choose to have dinner with them or not on occasion. If people don't have allergies they don't understand why and how serious it is.", "And anaphylaxis kills and kills very quickly", "What also gets me here that nobody told OP that someone brought fish.", "How long until people learn that *you don't fuck with someone's food*\n\nI don't care what you think, if you think they're faking it, or you don't like their religion, or it's not that big a deal.

Don't.", "By the title, I was expecting something like peanuts. NTA", "This is what makes me think that something's missing in this story and her friend thinks her allergy is bullshit. Like does she have a new allergy every few months, or a new ailment. Some people do that for attention, which would also explain why she wouldn't have an epi pen in her own home. If it's not at home where is it ? Not saying it's true, just a thought", "David's actions were completely unacceptable and dangerous. Full stop.\n\nThat said, it sounds like OP lashed out at all of the other guests due to David's callous actions, even those who did nothing wrong.

It's wild to me OP wouldn't have one.", "With how expensive epipens are, it could be hard for OP to get one, or maybe they had to use one recently and couldn't afford a replacement before the party. Either way, they were extra careful to remind of the allergy so they shouldn't have been stressing about an epipen in the first place in a space that should've been safe, their own home...", "How can they trust anyone at that party to actually clean correctly. All of them sat by while fish was being cooked and acted like OP was over reacting. I wouldn\u2019t trust they would do anything but pretend to wipe around. \n\nIf it were me, I\u2019d leave the house and call a relative to come help. Someone that took the allergy seriously.", "Ah.

And, the friend cooking fish was a DOUBLE AH. just cooking something as smelly as fish at someone else\u2019s house was an AH move. What kind of an AH gambles with someone\u2018s health like that?", "And even if they aren't deathly allergic, no one should have to suffer in their home. Like even if it was just a minor allergy, people should have been like ok cool different food. Like they should be able to be safe regardless of the severity, and the fact it's so severe just makes the situation worse.", "You are pretty much wrong about allergies. Any time/every time you get a reaction with swelling of the lips and throat it is considered life threatening. You are part of why people do not take these things seriously. You don't get an epi pen prescribed for hives. You get one for life threatening swelling of the lips and throat. Second hand contact being life threatening is also very common. Just wow.

She would still miss her own party.", "Seriously. I would have banned OP from the kitchen and cleaned it, following OP\u2019s instructions, myself. OP could still be exposed just cleaning everything up.

Or, even more likely, not realize a bag of chips was made in peanut oil. The kind of thing that is still assholish in its carelessness, but could at least just be careless.\n\nBut like, there is so much thought that goes into buying and *cooking* raw fish??

Part of being a friend is looking out for each other. Everyone was informed months ago and shortly before the party and should have had a yellow alert in their minds for fish in the house. A guest cooking fish in the kitchen was as high as the threat level could go before someone sees OP putting fish into their mouth without realizing it. \n\nAt minimum the guests who 'didnt do anything' should react with shame and apology at not having brought it up or stopped this fish cook, rather than complain that ending the party with now all contaminated food was unfair.

All I get is an upset stomach. I can have red grapes in small quantities at a time. And there\u2019s lots of juice cocktails that have red grape juice that it\u2019s also fine in small quantities. But the juice itself makes me sick to my stomach. It was discovered when I was 3. I can drink red wines just fine son that\u2019s usually what I bought. I am 45.

Allergies can change to be much worse with little to no warning.  And obviously he's bad enough to have been prescribed an epipen. Also allergies can vary the reaction by how it's induced, and from person to person.  For me I can tolerate someone cooking shrimp, though I don't care for the smell,  for my best friend he'll have a \"mild reaction\" it'll wreck him for a day.... almost like a mild food poisoning.  For both of us if we eat shrimp it's epi time and head to the hospital. Not only that but he's touch sensitive where he has to resort to a professional cleaning before he can safely use his kitchen again.  I just don some gloves (or more likely the wifey will) and give a thorough cleaning.", "How would you know, though?  Wouldn't you prefer to err on the side of caution and assume that the allergy is severe rather than guessing and watching someone go into anaphylaxis?  OP mentions an EPI pen.  This means OP's reaction is severe enough to warrant an antidote.", "It doesn't always. I've had allergic reactions that haven't gotten worse and I know many other people who have to. But it's important to be aware that it *can* get worse at any time.", "That's a very nice thing to do, especially with the price of eggs being what they are.", "The wine might be fine because the active allergen might be broken down by enzymes in the process of fermentation.\n\nYou might be able to figure out how to make red grape juice palatable with the use of am enzyme \ud83d\udc4d or some other fun chemistry \ud83e\uddc3", "Yes exactly. I have a very mild food allergy. I have never even been offered by a doctor to prescribe it. If my reaction was any more than it is, I would be upset if someone exposed me to it.
