So if you're going to bring food, don't bring fish. Well, my warning seemed to have fallen on deaf ears as one of the guests brought & cooked fish in my kitchen. \n\nWhen the party started, for the first like 40 minutes. I wasn't aware someone brought & was cooking fish inside of the house because I was outside the whole time. When I went inside to use the bathroom. I noticed the fish smell instantly. \n\nI immediately went to the kitchen and told the person cooking the fish to get that shit out of my house. And reminded everyone of my food allergy. A lot of the other people there were already eating some of the fish so now my whole house is contaminated with fish because people were touching everywhere. \n\nThe guy gave me some BS excuse \"Oh you told me a month ago about your allergy you should've reminded  people\" I then told him that I sent out a text 2 days ago to everyone reminding them & he said he didn't get it. Yeah sure.\n\nAnyway, at this point I was panicking because I did not have my Epipen in case I get a severe allergic reaction. Also, I ate some of the food that was being cooked in my kitchen, Food contamination with the fish was likely. \n\n I kicked everyone out of my party, even though it was still early in the evening, and I had invited them all over to celebrate. A lot of them travelled far but at this point I did not care. \n\nSome of the guests got pissed off saying I could just get rid of the fish & they all could wash their hands & I could just chill outside until the fish smell went away. I told them to fuck off & that they can all blame David for almost killing me. They thought I was overreacting. Which I probably was because again, I was pissed off. I was yelling at this point.  \n\nA lot of my friends said that I ruined the party because I overreacted because I did not have to kick everyone out of the party since they did not bring the fish. And that I treated David to harshly because it was a honest mistake & they recorded me yelling at him which I honestly feel guilty about. \n\nWas I the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1678088220, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11js23t/aita_for_getting_angry_kicking_everyone_out_of_my/", "score": 171, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Most people wouldn't start cooking at a party they're invited to without checking with the host first. And cooking something with a strong smell, like fish, is even less likely. With your repeated reminders to your guests about your fish allergy, it seems to me that David did it on purpose, either to \"prove\" that you aren't really allergic (something that often happens because some AH don't believe allergies are real) or to push you into reacting like you did. It's possible that other guests were in on it, and waiting for your reaction so they could film it.\nDon't just kick these people out of your home. Kick them out of your life.

That was gross negligence and you could have seriously been hurt.  Boundaries mean nothing if they don't come with consequences.  I guarantee no one is going to forget about your fish allergy again.  In the future, I would suggest banning people from bringing food at all, and ask them to bring cash if they want to contribute instead so that you can buy all the food.", "Most likely NTA so I'll go ahead with my verdict, but also INFO: How strong is your reaction to fish?

Every person who watched fish being prepared and being passed around in the kitchen without immediately alerting OP also needs to go. They all knew about the allergy, and all of them decided to allow the contamination to spread instead of stopping the one asshole immediately and reading him the riot act. OP, I'm sorry to say what you have learned is that none of them can be trusted with your safety or even to show basic civility. Block them all and start over.\n\nOP doesn't have an aversion to fish odor. They have a deathly allergy to fish. The residue has to be assumed to be all over their kitchen and god knows where else.

Goodness, st the era of Google, this is just unforgivable not to be aware. NTA", "I think you should have had an epi pen with you regardless since you have a severe allergy to fish. That is very irresponsible on your part. The cross contamination that could occur just on an I\u2019m out running errands level would make my eye twitch. My daughter is anaphylactic level allergic to horse dander- so we carry one with us everywhere just in case and avoid obvious horse locations. As a person with severe allergies you need to be responsible for your own health and carry it with you. Yes, your friends should not have brought fish but there is always the possibility some a hole will have touched it and not told you now you are contaminated anyways.", "NTA  \nWhy can't people just follow the directions they're given...", "EVERYONE was informed, anyone who partook in eating the fish without questioning it or reminding the guy who brought it was just as guilty..\n\nProblem with allergies though is the severity is a spectrum, and while its common enough for people to be deathly allergic upon consumption (even with food contaminated by being cooked using the same utensils), its actually rare for people to be so severely allergic upon second hand contact.\n\nI would imagine you might come up in hives, rash, or swelling if you touch fish residue if you are that severely allergic, but most people would not understand how much of an impact the allergy can have because for most people it's like \"i have an allergy to (x food ingredient) and I don't have this much trouble, why are you overreacting?\"\n\nPro tip to anyone.. if you are asked not to bring/serve a type of food because someone is allergic, assume they are deathly allergic unless you KNOW or are informed otherwise. Ask whether they can safely just avoid the dish, or how to mitigate potential issues.\n\nIf someone else brings the allergen into the picture, you don't need to name and shame, but at least inform them to discard it and help to limit any contamination.. DO NOT ignore the allergy and partake in the food.\n\nMy sister is unfortunate enough to have a severe reaction to Latex and cannot attend birthday parties with latex balloons because the simple act of inflating them spreads latex particles through the air. The amount of times she has turned up to events and had to immediately walk out the door and leave (even for family events).. it just sucks that people don't take this shit seriously.\n\nNTA", "What also gets me here that nobody told OP that someone brought fish, nah they just took it and started eating although clearly they remembered that OP is allergic to fish since they didn't bring any fish themselves!", "Your username works well here \ud83d\ude02", "My thoughts exactly. Fish is fucking gross unless it's a grilled salmon.. which could've been done OUTSIDE.", "Good point. So called friends were aware about fish allergy, and nobody cared.", "They put your life in danger because they couldn't go without fish for one day? Do you ever want to see these people again? Anaphylaxis is a life threatening condition. And anyone who thinks shouting when your life is in danger is an \"overreaction\" is not someone you want trying to keep you alive while you're struggling for breath awaiting an ambulance. Would they see you collapse and leave you to sleep it off, not realising every second counts? They do not acknowledge your allergy and do not value your health, your life, or your right to limit what food is in the house. Does he take bacon to his Jewish friends house, eat peanuts in nut safe restaurants or munch on meat in a vegan household? Even if it wasn't life or death, you are allowed to ban food from being cooked in your own kitchen.", "Another note OP: if this party has just happened, get a trusted friend to help you clean as there may be more traces around your house then you realise and a reaction could still occur. If you can afford to, throw out the cooking utensils & pan as even a good clean can leave some allergens if fish is to you what peanuts are to me. Be safe and find better friends. Even alone is better than dead.", "People who don't have experience with allergies would have no idea how thoroughly everything needed to be cleaned.

The original psycho who still tries to ruin my life over 13 years after getting rid of her baby boy lol", "I mean yeah it does. OP said they needed an epipen so we can assume it's pretty severe and that's why I went ahead with NTA. But yes severity absolutely matters here. Say it was a super mild allergy, maybe a little rash at worst (which I know isn't the case), then throwing everyone out would be over the top imo. Throw fish guy out by all means, but not necessarily everyone.", "Yeah I agree, that's why I went ahead with NTA."]}
