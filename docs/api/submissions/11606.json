So if you're going to bring food, don't bring fish. Well, my warning seemed to have fallen on deaf ears as one of the guests brought & cooked fish in my kitchen. \n\nWhen the party started, for the first like 40 minutes. I wasn't aware someone brought & was cooking fish inside of the house because I was outside the whole time. When I went inside to use the bathroom. I noticed the fish smell instantly. \n\nI immediately went to the kitchen and told the person cooking the fish to get that shit out of my house. And reminded everyone of my food allergy. A lot of the other people there were already eating some of the fish so now my whole house is contaminated with fish because people were touching everywhere. \n\nThe guy gave me some BS excuse \"Oh you told me a month ago about your allergy you should've reminded  people\" I then told him that I sent out a text 2 days ago to everyone reminding them & he said he didn't get it. Yeah sure.\n\nAnyway, at this point I was panicking because I did not have my Epipen in case I get a severe allergic reaction. Also, I ate some of the food that was being cooked in my kitchen, Food contamination with the fish was likely. \n\n I kicked everyone out of my party, even though it was still early in the evening, and I had invited them all over to celebrate. A lot of them travelled far but at this point I did not care. \n\nSome of the guests got pissed off saying I could just get rid of the fish & they all could wash their hands & I could just chill outside until the fish smell went away. I told them to fuck off & that they can all blame David for almost killing me. They thought I was overreacting. Which I probably was because again, I was pissed off. I was yelling at this point.  \n\nA lot of my friends said that I ruined the party because I overreacted because I did not have to kick everyone out of the party since they did not bring the fish. And that I treated David to harshly because it was a honest mistake & they recorded me yelling at him which I honestly feel guilty about. \n\nWas I the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1678088220, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11js23t/aita_for_getting_angry_kicking_everyone_out_of_my/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

People aren\u2019t aware of how serious allergies can be and how little it can take.", "NTA\n\nA load of people blatantly ingnored your severe seeming food allergy and ruined the fun for all. \n\nIn this situation the first step is hire some sort of professional cleaning company and the second is drop every single person who bought fish out of your life. In my opinion quality over quantity in friends", "Nta - You reminded your guests about your severe allergy and not to bring such dishes. Guest then proceeds to bring banned food to the party and begins to cook it?!?!? The guest brought enough allergic food that he then SHARED it with others causing the allergy to further spread throughout the house. Your life is greater than someones fucking fish and chips dinner the fact that they tried to gaslight you and easily brush it off says a lot. Human life > someones fucking unauthorized fish cooking", "The fact that your allergy is so severe that you've reminded them multiple times, 100% NTA. You threw a party and allowed guests the use of your kitchen. You allowed them into your home and that's how they treated you? \n\"Hey yeah we know this is your house but why don't you just wait outside?\" \nI'm sorry but you don't get to tell someone to wait outside their own party, let alone their own home. Drop all those friends", "NTA - Get new friends. \n\nNobody stopped Dave, nobody saw him pulling out raw fish and stepped in and said whoa!! OP is allergic!

Who the hell brings fish to a party and just starts randomly cooking it in the kitchen?", "NTA\n\nI could see an argument that you overreacted. A more realistic argument would be to say that you panicked.\n\nYour life was in danger and you panicked.", "NTA your friends are more concerned about the party happening than your health crisis? Real friends would be asking to stay behind to help you clean up.", "Definitely NTA. Your health and safety come first, especially in your own home. My uncle used to have such a severe shellfish allergy that you couldn\u2019t cook lobster in the house at all unless all the windows were open and he was outside. Allergies can be severe, and different for everyone. You informed your guests of the allergy ahead of time so there\u2019s no excuse for this. Honestly, bringing fish would be bad enough, but to COOK IT in your kitchen? Hell, I wouldn\u2019t cook fish at someone else\u2019s house even if there wasn\u2019t an allergy because it reeks & that\u2019s just rude. I\u2019m sorry this happened. The process of decontaminating everything had to have been a nightmare. I hope David is permanently off the invite list going forward.", "My experience with food allergies is that they affect my cognition, and i would be in no shape to be hosting a bunch of people for a party of any kind. Being exposed to airborne triggers like that typically puts me in a catatonic-like state incapable of anything except lying on the couch/bed. \n\nYou know your body best, and if you needed everyone out of the house so you could cope with the exposure, then you needed everyone out of the house. NTA.", "NTA. Best to get everyone out ASAP so you can start scrubbing down surfaces without cross contaminating things.", "NTA\nCan not believe how rude David was to bring fish and even cook it in your kitchen. It's not overreacting, it sounds more like panic. It was a life threatening situation for you.", "NTA. Most people wouldn't start cooking at a party they're invited to without checking with the host first. And cooking something with a strong smell, like fish, is even less likely. With your repeated reminders to your guests about your fish allergy, it seems to me that David did it on purpose, either to \"prove\" that you aren't really allergic (something that often happens because some AH don't believe allergies are real) or to push you into reacting like you did. It's possible that other guests were in on it, and waiting for your reaction so they could film it.\nDon't just kick these people out of your home. Kick them out of your life. Anyone who is cool with putting a friend's life at risk for the sake of a party doesn't deserve your friendship. A true friend would have offered to help you clean the house.", "NTA - your \"friends\" don't act like friends if they think having fish around someone who is.severely allergic isn't a big deal. I bet they'd be the first ones to complain if the situation were reversed & they were the ones who were allergic...", "Absolutely NTA. On the weekend if actually had a bad reaction to something I didn't know had Cashews in it. It was the scariest thing that's ever happened to me, I couldn't breathe and I was having a panic attack at the same time. I found out today I now need an epi pen. I absolutely understand you and after experiencing what I did, you were completely right in getting very angry. It's no joke.", "NTA People like this infuriate me. Instead of blaming the one person who ruined everything, they blame the victim. How on earth do they think you\u2019re in the wrong. Not an ounce of respect for you Op. you are not in the wrong.", "NTA.  Holy crap.  The rest of the family deserves to be kicked out for defending David. That was not an \"honest mistake.\". That was gross negligence and you could have seriously been hurt.  Boundaries mean nothing if they don't come with consequences.  I guarantee no one is going to forget about your fish allergy again.  In the future, I would suggest banning people from bringing food at all, and ask them to bring cash if they want to contribute instead so that you can buy all the food.", "Most likely NTA so I'll go ahead with my verdict, but also INFO: How strong is your reaction to fish? How much do you need to consume for it to become dangerous?", "NTA. It's your house and you're allergy. Your safety was compromised and it's ok to try to gain back as much control as you could as quickly as possibly. Even if it meant kicking everyone out.", "YTA.  \n\nNot for being allergic to fish.  Not for being upset when somebody brought some.  But penalizing innocent friends for something they didn\u2019t do.\n\nI have food allergies too.  I know what it\u2019s like when people forget or don\u2019t know.    At that point it\u2019s about having some grace and not being an AH about it.", "YTA to the guest other than the guest who brought the fish .

Every single person who whined at OP instead of expressing alarm about the risk of triggering their deathly allergy has helpfully screened themselves out of the contacts list permanently. Every person who watched fish being prepared and being passed around in the kitchen without immediately alerting OP also needs to go. They all knew about the allergy, and all of them decided to allow the contamination to spread instead of stopping the one asshole immediately and reading him the riot act. OP, I'm sorry to say what you have learned is that none of them can be trusted with your safety or even to show basic civility. Block them all and start over.\n\nOP doesn't have an aversion to fish odor. They have a deathly allergy to fish. The residue has to be assumed to be all over their kitchen and god knows where else. How is OP ever supposed to feel safe in their home or with their belongings, knowing anywhere on them may be allergen residue waiting to be touched? Home is supposed to be our safe place, our comfort zone. What these people did is such a violation. It is not one guy screwing up, it's the entire group showing reckless disregard for OP's life, comfort, and security. They all belong in the trash.", "Finally someone said it!
