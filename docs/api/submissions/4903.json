I am not comfortable with this since a. we have never met, b. this is my money that he expects me to use to purchase something/give to him, c. I am a single mom who has her own responsibilities.

That's a big red flag.", "I think you're right to be suspicious sadly. It's a shame, but remember the catfish is the baddie, not you. Incredibly smart people get taken in by these people!
