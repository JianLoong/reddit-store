Told my friend it\u2019s weird two men in their late 30s want to take her 13 year old son on vacation, now she won\u2019t talk to me", "selftext": "We\u2019d been friends for four years, and my husband felt very close in that short time to her and her family. She\u2019d recently become really close with two men who moved in down the street, and the two men started attending their kid\u2019s sports games and being super involved in the family\u2019s life. I always had weird feelings about one of the men (call him \u201cBrandon\u201d), especially after he was encouraging her tween son to lie to her about things he knows he\u2019ll get into trouble for. \n\nExample: the boy isn\u2019t supposed to hang out at the lake without letting his mom know, but one day he did anyway\u2026 and then called her for a ride because it was hot and he didn\u2019t feel like walking back. Brandon said (to the boy), \u201cIf you just walked home, you would\u2019ve gotten away with everything. You could\u2019ve done anything you wanted and she\u2019d never know!\u201d Alarms were going off in my head, and my friend just laughed, as that\u2019s her response to most things. \n\nAnyway, fast forward.. Brandon and his boyfriend invited the boy on a trip to Kentucky for the summer. Two weeks alone with the Brandon in a travel trailer, a week traveling with his boyfriend present, and then another week or two alone with Brandon driving back (cut short, we\u2019ll get to that). \n\nI mentioned it to my friend, \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s a little weird an older guy wants to hang out with your son so much?\u201d She insisted she trusts him.. so I asked, \u201cwas it your idea or his to have the boy go on the trip? Is he footing the bill for the kid to travel?\u201d Mind you, there\u2019s a sister in the picture who wasn\u2019t invited, Brandon is a psychologist for the military, and he was buying the kid food and gifts along the way. \n\nMaybe I read too many news stories about the creepy coaches or \u201cmentors\u201d who take advantage of kids, but I let my friend know I thought it was weird. Now she won\u2019t talk to me. However, after I brought it up, the next day she insisted the boy fly home cutting their trip short. It\u2019s like she trusted my advice, but hates me for it. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692549465, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15wg2tw/aita_told_my_friend_its_weird_two_men_in_their/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even without the news and podcasts, it is odd, to say the least. A kid that age with grown adults who aren\u2019t relatives (not that relatives mean total protection from creeps) is an odd situation and could lead to trouble that doesn\u2019t include that which our minds jumped to. They get pulled over and a cop may not trust that this is on the up and up. Brandon could end up in a hell of a lot of trouble too. But all in all, you made a good call in saying something because that\u2019s too large an age gap to feel ok about it.", "NTA. This is textbook grooming behavior.", "NTA\n\nI find it even more concerning that Brandon is in the field.  That is what really tipped it into blaring red flags.  If you're in the field, you know the behavior Brandon is displaying is grooming 101 with all the inappropriate boundaries and the timeline of this fast friendship.  Without him being in the field, it could just be a well meaning weirdo that just doesn't understand social norms or wants to help a family out.  With being in the field *AND* in the military, the likelihood of grooming is crazy high.  \n\nYour friend might just need some time. Can you imagine how she feels?

That said yes we are conditioned by society to assume the worse. At the same time is it worth the worse potentially happening?

You're nta for voicing your concerns. I've been away with family friends before, but there was always other kids involved. One of my friends is kinda a \"bad influence\" on my daughter and they bicker and have pretend drama with each other and he acts like a high school gossiper sometimes when asking her about school and friends, but it's harmless. If I wrote it out, it would sound bad, but I witness the relationship and know it's fine. So, while this situation does sound kinda strange, maybe we're missing context on why they wanted him to go on the trip and what the whole relationship looks like. Could be innocent or not. Hopefully your friend is a good judge of character and instincts.", "INFO: Do you think you would have acted the same if they were a straight couple?

When you make friends and know them well, it really shouldn't matter what sex or orientation they have, if you trust them then you trust them, end of story.
