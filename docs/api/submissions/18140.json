She would always make comments about my body growing up and control things she has no control over, like telling me I can\u2019t wear \u201cboy\u201d clothes because I\u2019m not a male (I\u2019m trans). Well a few months back she touched my arm and told me that I had fat arms, I only weigh 120lb and at the time I weighed less. I have struggle with an eating disorder and comments like that are hard for me to handle. Last week I was at my grandparents with my mother and father and I was wearing shorts because it was hot. My mother needed something so I had to go to her. After I finished what she wanted me to do she pointed out my legs and told me I have cubby legs and that I should start working out to define my legs more. I told her that it wasn\u2019t her place to tell me what to do with my body and she couldn\u2019t control it. I also told her it\u2019s my body and that if I want to work out and define my legs more I will on my own time. She got upset and told me that she was my mother and that I had no right to talk to her that way. She had told me that she raised me and just didn\u2019t want her kid to be fat. I of course walked away and later on my father told me I was being an asshole got talking to my mother the way that I did. He told me that she was just looking out for me and I said things I really shouldn\u2019t have said. I don\u2019t feel like I was being an asshole but maybe I was and just didn\u2019t notice. \n\nEdit: I am 5\u20192 and I work on a farm and I\u2019m active. Also I am recovering from my eating disorder. I am not a harm to myself or others. Thank you all for all the worry\n\nEdit 2: you all have given me some good advice rn I don\u2019t have much I can do but I will turn 18 soon and I already have a safer house to go to. \n\nIf there was anything I said wrong that made me an asshole please let me know.", "created_utc": 1685021451, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13rhvu0/aita_for_telling_my_mom_she_doesnt_control_my_body/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like she has some issues with her own self image and is projecting them on you which isn't fair and can harm you emotionally and mentally.
