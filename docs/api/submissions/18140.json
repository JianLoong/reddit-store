She would always make comments about my body growing up and control things she has no control over, like telling me I can\u2019t wear \u201cboy\u201d clothes because I\u2019m not a male (I\u2019m trans). Well a few months back she touched my arm and told me that I had fat arms, I only weigh 120lb and at the time I weighed less. I have struggle with an eating disorder and comments like that are hard for me to handle. Last week I was at my grandparents with my mother and father and I was wearing shorts because it was hot. My mother needed something so I had to go to her. After I finished what she wanted me to do she pointed out my legs and told me I have cubby legs and that I should start working out to define my legs more. I told her that it wasn\u2019t her place to tell me what to do with my body and she couldn\u2019t control it. I also told her it\u2019s my body and that if I want to work out and define my legs more I will on my own time. She got upset and told me that she was my mother and that I had no right to talk to her that way. She had told me that she raised me and just didn\u2019t want her kid to be fat. I of course walked away and later on my father told me I was being an asshole got talking to my mother the way that I did. He told me that she was just looking out for me and I said things I really shouldn\u2019t have said. I don\u2019t feel like I was being an asshole but maybe I was and just didn\u2019t notice. \n\nEdit: I am 5\u20192 and I work on a farm and I\u2019m active. Also I am recovering from my eating disorder. I am not a harm to myself or others. Thank you all for all the worry\n\nEdit 2: you all have given me some good advice rn I don\u2019t have much I can do but I will turn 18 soon and I already have a safer house to go to. \n\nEdit 3: this will be the last edit I will do on this post. Thank you for your support and you all have been so kind. I wore a different shirt (a crop top) today and my sister made a comment \u201cwhy are you wearing that it doesn\u2019t fit you\u201d her words exactly but I don\u2019t mind the comment because I know my worth and her worth.

They purposefully tear you down. Family isn\u2019t about blood it\u2019s about love and support. These people aren\u2019t acting like family, they\u2019re acting like abusive, neglectful assholes.\n\nYou deserve better and you will find better.", "I'm an inch taller than OP and when I weighed 120 I was a size 0.", "NTA\n\nKeep reminding yourself that you have absolutely no responsibility or obligation to your parents. It will help when you go no contact.", "NTA\n\nYour mother has body dysmorphia and is literally using you as a substitute for tormenting herself. This is so, so toxic. She deserved a much harsher response, you are entirely justified.", "NTA good luck op. \u2728\ud83c\udf20\ud83c\udf86\u2601\ufe0f\ud83c\udf15", "NTA. You already have an eating disorder! Of course she is TA.", "NTA. Your entire family are very invalidating toward you. I'm glad you have a safe place to go to when you need it. Good luck.", "NTA. I would have told them that they are partially to blame for your ED.", "Yeah, it's shocking that OP has an eating disorder with parents like these /s", "NTA. *HUGS*", "Your parents are AH ,\nI hope you do what you find right asap.", "NTA - next time she makes comments about your body and weight just tell her you got it all from her and she should be proud of that.", "You are not the jerk she don\u2019t own you", "NTA. If she can\u2019t take it, she shouldn\u2019t dish it", "NTA - \n\nMom: \u201cI just don\u2019t want you to be fat\u201d\n\nYou: \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be a body shaming, asshole but here we are.\u201d\n\nI grew up being constantly told how fat I was at 5\u20197\u201d 115lbs. It was some major deflection on my ex stepmother\u2019s part but I still have issues with it 40 years later. You are kinda my hero. Keep knowing your worth and being badass!", "NTA. My ex-MIL had a massive problem when my son\u2019s mom came out as a trans woman.  She basically wrote my ex (and by extension, our son) our of her life for a few years.  I made sure my ex knew she always had a place with our kiddo and me for holidays and birthdays.  My ex-MIL has since gotten past her hang ups with my ex, but they still have a strained relationship nearly 5 years later.", "NTA\n\nYour mother sounds like she wants an idealized version of you that makes her look like some idealized version of her. The older I get, the more I realize most parents care more about their image than whatever \"joy of having kids\" bullshit.", "NTA, your mom clearly values her skewed status as a \"good mom\" over you as her child.\n\nShe can sit and spin.", "Ugh the arm-grabbing, belly-pinching, hair-stroking, and ass-smacking shit always makes me sick... After enough of it growing up and even as an adult who's small and looks young, I think there should be a special category of physical abuse that isn't considered violent enough to technically count as violence nor sexual enough to technically count as sexual abuse.", "Username checks out...?", "I don't know about OP but I've mostly given up on tact upon realizing that it's completely fucking useless in most situations. Then again, so is a lack thereof.", "You don't need many brain cells to know 120 lbs at 5'2\" isn't even close to obese. Seems you don't have any.\n\nEDIT: Also not to be racist or sexist - not that you don't deserve some bigotry, being a bigot yourself - but how did I know it'd be some single Indian dude before even checking your profile?", "And at least half the comments will unfortunately \"NTA, sorry your kid is so ungrateful and vindictive\" lol", "Your story - ~80 lbs, \"a bit too much\", then back down to 120-130 lbs - and your husband sound similar to mine lol :)", ">back handed compliments\n\n\"Your face is really clearing up\" was literally the first thing my brother said to me after not seeing me in over a year...", "My mom buys me clothes sizes too small to encourage dieting. Even as a grown adult. Used to love bomb me with snacks... mixed signals.", "My husband is roughly the same height and weight as OP. I don't know OP, everyone is different, but my husband is underweight. In his case, it's partially because his mother always bitches about getting less EBT because he's working, like his money isn't good enough or something. Makes him not want to eat because she bitches when he spends his own money on food, constantly asks if he's running out of the food he likes, blows her EBT on food literally no one here likes, and then bitches when the food no one asked her to buy goes to waste. Also makes him not want to work because he's tired from not eating and what's the point if his mom, despite her constant bitching when he isn't working, would rather him be on welfare forever like her? Oh and I almost forgot she did the opposite of OP's mom during the brief time he personally felt overweight: insisted he looked his best, comparing him lovingly to herself. She's 4'10\" and 300 lbs. Mind you, none of this was ill-meaning and yet it still fucked my husband up. OP's mom seems like she's actually trying to be hurtful.", "Aaannd that's literally my only motivation for staying calm anymore in such situations: it might make you look less bad than the other person. Maybe.", "NTA at all. Comments about someone\u2019s weight are never ok, but when someone is in recovery for an E D it can have a much harsher impact and repercussions. A year or so into my own recovery, I got together with my biological family after not seeing them for a few years. The first thing my grandmother said to me was that I had gotten \u201cgordita\u201d (chubby/fat). She didn\u2019t even mean it to be offensive. The last time she had seen me, i was extremely unhealthy and she was commenting on how much better I looked in a way that was appropriate with her culture and way of life. Gordita can also be used as a term of endearment. And I knew that and was fully aware of her intentions. Even so, it put a bump in my recovery. What I\u2019m trying to say is that your mom needs to get her priorities in order. Your reaction (even if said harshly) was absolutely justified.", "We know why they have an eating disorder! NTA", "My mom is exactly like OPs - she\u2019d make a lot of disgusted faces when she\u2019d see my body and she said really horrible shit to me and publicly humiliated me for eating all the time, but the thing is, I ALWAYS fought back, and it didn\u2019t matter. My mom knew how to wear me down till I would break down/cry/apologize, agree that I was fat and I would work on losing weight (I was 125lbs, 5\u20196\u201d.) \n\nSuffice to say, I hate the woman now (with a passion) and we are no contact! You can\u2019t reason with a delusional woman who simply CANNOT fathom how painful her words and actions are."]}
