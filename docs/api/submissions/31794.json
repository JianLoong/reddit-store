My older sister (15F) isn't as well behaved in comparison (sleeps late - i don't really see this as a big problem but my mom does, is rude to my parents - especially rude to my mom, is always on her phone - I lowkey am too haha, always going out with her friends, etc)  (her grades are still okay though)\n\nFor context, my exams are coming soon, so I've been studying a lot recently. Just now in the afternoon, my mom asked me to hang some clothes, when I was taking a study break. (my sister's exams have already passed, so I expected my mom to ask her to do chores instead) But obviously, this wasn't a problem to me. But when I was hanging them, we ran out of hangers, and I had to search all around (and even outside of) our house for hangers. Again, I was just completing the task I was assigned so I didn't feel irritated, but it stretched out the simple task of hanging up my family's clothes into a 40-minute search for hangers + hanging clothes.\n\nRight after I was done with that chore, I went back to studying. And after 3 hours of it, I went back downstairs, just for my mom to ask me to start hanging clothes again. At this point, my brain was complete mush after studying, and my sister was just scrolling on social media, so I literally was beyond confused as to why she didn't just ask my sister (my sister had literally been doing NOTHING all day). But obviously, she's my mom. So I told her that I was really tired and needed a break. My mom made it very clear that she was upset with my response by flashing me a dirty look, but she didn't say anything else.\n\nLater, I went to make some green tea to give myself some energy, my mom suddenly threw a glass cup that she finished drinking from next to me (it didn't shatter though) and I asked her if she was okay. She responded with \"no, I can't even ask you guys to do a simple chore.\" \n\nAt this point I got really mad, she hadn't even asked my sister to do anything for the whole day even though she was completely free, and usually, if I was free I always do all the chores, now she was telling me that she couldn't entrust me with a single task? I told her that my purpose wasn't to serve her, and that I'm a human being too, and she completely lost it, I'm now upstairs again after not wanting to listen to her shouting about how I'm a horrible daughter and blablabla. \n\nBut I really want to know what other people think about the way I acted, AITA for telling her that?", "created_utc": 1700992802, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1847gsn/aita_for_telling_my_mom_that_my_purpose_isnt_to/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
