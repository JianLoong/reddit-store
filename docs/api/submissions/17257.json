It's your job to make sure rhat she knows what she did was wrong, and why. Punishment is part of that, but on its own won't help her be a better person. I don't think your punishment was excessive.

I would *hope* that there are always consequences at home beyond suspension. Suspension isn\u2019t to punish the kid who did something wrong. How the hell are they gonna learn a lesson by just staying at home or working in the office for a bit? Suspensions are for the sake of the ones bullied, or the ones wronged, so the offending kid doesn\u2019t simply get to waltz back into their world the very next day. \n\nThe school\u2019s hands are extremely tied when it comes to consequences. **Schools are not parents. It is still a parent\u2019s job to parent their children.** I am not sure how this message somehow got lost in modern society.\n\nOP, I would also have an honest conversation with your daughter about the natural consequences of her actions. Don\u2019t mention why you left your ex, but make her aware that other people will always be watching the way she conducts herself. How she behaves gives people an impression about the kind of person she is, and those can be difficult to change. Behaviour like this could very well affect her relationships in the future. \n\nAlternatively, being a good person can afford you more opportunities people who aren\u2019t kind don\u2019t even know they\u2019re missing out on.  No one is going to tell you the reason you didn\u2019t get hired is because someone in the business saw you be a dick to a girl with autism in high school. They\u2019ll just pass on your application and you\u2019ll be none the wiser. \n\nSame goes with dates. Go to Reddit and every single time the question comes up about \u201cwhat\u2019s an immediate turnoff,\u201d the top answer includes someone who is mean to people for no reason. And they\u2019re not gonna tell you, they\u2019re just gonna ghost you. \n\nKindness has value in society. Humility has value in society. Being a mean person only had social value with other mean people, so they can feel better about themselves. You are a reflection of the five people you spent the most time with. Ask her to think king and hard about the people she spends the most time with at school, and if they\u2019re worth becoming someone society doesn\u2019t appreciate.", "This.

To say it's a joke belittles the damage that words can cause especially to someone that may already have self-esteem or self-worth issues. Bullying is a huge problem in our nations schools and have had large roles in children seeking to self-harm. It should always be taken very seriously.\n\nA suspension is a school level punishment, basically a cooling off period hoping that a child can return to school with a better attitude for fear of their future being clouded by being 'a troubled student' it is usually very ineffective at actually teaching a lesson. \n\nA parent's responsibility is to teach their child how to be a good citizen and treat those around them with care and empathy. If you must punish a child to drive this lesson home then sometimes those actions are necessary. I would however suggest at least discussing with your daughter why this is destructive behavior. Perhaps seek some counciling, if you are in a position to. Obviously your daughter is going through something and needs to find an outlet that isn't harmful to others. \n\nNTA - I hope you can find a solution to help your daughter.", "NTA\n\n You don't get an Out of School suspension for a couple of jokes. There's likely been a pattern.\n\nSecond off, an OSS isn't a punishment for the kid. It's a vacation, and if she learns that \"Just make fun of the special needs kid, get a few days off\", you're going to be seeing a lot more.\n\nI would make sure your daughter is miserable. All homework needs to be done, all housework (cleaning the kitchen, etc) go to her, etc. \"Here's a toothbrush, clean the bathroom\", etc.\n\nI would ask the school if this has been a pattern, and also see if there's a way to have her serve in school suspensions instead in the future. Tell them that you want to know of any future incidents of bullying ASAP.\n\nFinally, consider therapy. There's likely an empathy gap.\n\nMy kid had a similar thing. He has an anxiety disorder and sensitivity to loud noises, and we thought that him going after the autistic kid in his class was because this kid had a very loud verbal tic, and he was just reacting that way because he didn't feel like he had any other options. As a result, we started with kid gloves, trying to get him to use his IEP accommodations like hearing protection, or a room he can go to for quiet, etc. \n\nHis behavior got worse, culminating with him waving to get a teacher's attention, shoving the kid, and then asking if he could get suspended. It only got better when we got the school to stop giving him out of schools, and instead giving him In Schools. Plus an adjustment to his meds, and making him miserable at home when he did stuff like that.", "NTA.\n\nSuspension's barely a punishment nowadays to begin with. All doing nothing would do is act as a tacit approval.\n\nIf you missed lessons in the past, you were pretty well fucked if you weren't just going over old work. \n\nNot to mention dealing with parents that suddenly had to figure out what to do with you, fucking up their schedule. You know, back when parents were allowed and expected to beat the everloving out of their kids.\n\nAt this point, shit's basically a reward for foing bad if your parents don't punish you in some way.", "NTA. Some consequences are enough to learn the lesson in the behavior. But discrimination is not OK and suspension does not drive that home.

Even if she\u2019s just helping a preschool teacher or doing playground duty or something like that. It would give her an opportunity to see children in a different light, and provide some assistance to those in need.  The reason I suggest children younger than her is it might not be so uncomfortable for her or seen as a serious punishment. She might be more willing to get involved with younger children.\n\nIt\u2019s going to take some work to undo the negative impact of her mom or others. Teenagers are naturally a little bit selfish.
