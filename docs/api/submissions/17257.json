Suspension from school isn\u2019t enough because she needs to know that you aren\u2019t condoning her behaviour and to get suspended it must have been pretty serious.", "NTA.  It's good that daughter realizes that she's in trouble with the center of moral learning -- i.e., the home -- as well as with the school, which is enforcing \"in society\" manners.  \n\nDon't fret about ex's reaction; you and she dissolved your partnership, and don't have to agree on child-rearing techniques.", "Nta. It's your job to make sure rhat she knows what she did was wrong, and why. Punishment is part of that, but on its own won't help her be a better person. I don't think your punishment was excessive. The school punished her, as the institution where the behavior occurred. As a parent, you also show her your disapproval.", "NTA \n\nI have a feeling I\u2019m going to get trashed for what I\u2019m about to say, but can you document dates and details of your wife\u2019s mean girl BS over the years, then document this incident with your daughter (i.e., daughter\u2019s behavior, and ex-wife\u2019s reaction) go to a judge, and get sole custody with supervised visitation with her mom? \n\nBullying is another word for abuse. You don\u2019t want your daughter growing up to be abusive. If she\u2019s spending 1/2 of her time with her mom, then she will (and has already started to) likely pick up her abusive traits believes and behaviors.", "NTA. I think you should consider bringing your daughter in for individual therapy though.", "NTA. I assume you would have punished your daughter had she done the same thing outside of school too. The school punished her for doing it to another student, who it is their responsibility to protect from bullying, while on their premises. You are punishing her as a parent actively trying to raise a child with a good moral compass who does not cause distress or harm to others, especially not for her own enjoyment. \n\nReceiving multiple punishments from different authority figures is absolutely appropriate here.", "NTA. But there needs to be a long term plan to help keep these behaviours from getting worse. Talk to professionals and get some ideas on what you can do. Maybe try counselling/therapy.  Grounding her as further punishment is good, but it's not going to get her to unlearn all the things she learned from her mom. Or learn to recognize toxic behaviours to avoid.", "NTA, being suspended from school is a reward, not a punishment anyway. I never understood suspension as punishment, when I was in high school I skipped school a lot and my punishment for not going to school was I couldn't go to school for a few more days, lol.", "NTA You are a great parent for not letting your daughter bully others under the guise of joking.\n\nIt\u2019s refreshing to read of a parent who is willing to do what it takes to keep their child on\nthe right path. Too many parents are afraid of their children being angry with them.\n\nI\u2019ll bet your ex and your mother will sing a different tune when your daughter turns her bullying on them.", "NTA.  The world needs a LOT more parents like you.", "NTA a suspension is nothing but a vacation", "NTA\n\nBeing suspended but still having full access to the internet and your phone is not a punishment, it's a vacation.", "The school is not her parent and isn\u2019t responsible for disciplining her in a way to address and correct the problem. A few days off school with internet and phone is a vacation. Your ex is TA. Keep parenting! Keep trying!", "NTA. Suspension is the school's punishment. It's up to you as the parent to reinforce that her behavior won't be tolerated regardless of what the school thinks.", "I\u2019m not a parent, but one thing I\u2019ve always thought about is to ask \u2018why?\u2019 Why is it fun to bully this autistic girl? Why is \u2018x reason to bully her\u2019 funny? She already admitted to it. Why is it funny to ridicule and put down others? At the end of the cycle hopefully she will see that it\u2019s not. Why is that joke funny to her? What part of that \u2018joke\u2019 does the other person laugh at? I hope it is as simple as pointing out the ridiculousness in being mean to others for a laugh.", "Your ex doesn't want to punish her because it sounds like something she would have done, that's why she doesn't see it as a big deal. NTA you need to nip it in the bud", "Nta but your daughter needs to learn some empathy for people with disabilities. Instead of just taking away electronics for like 2 weeks, I would tell her she has to complete a certain amount of hours volunteering, working with disabled people. Say 20 hours to get her stuff back. She needs a wake up call", "NTA", "NTA\n\nNo, what is a joke is your ex's parenting skills. Then again, her true character is to be an asshole who treats people like shit to bump up her own ego, and your daughters modeling that behaviour.\n\nFrankly, I don't think taking away her electronics is exactly good enough, because it's not going to teach her basic empathy. A suspension won't either as a lot of teens treat that as, \"fun time outside of school.\" She hasn't been really punished at all."]}
