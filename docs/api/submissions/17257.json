It's your job to make sure rhat she knows what she did was wrong, and why. Punishment is part of that, but on its own won't help her be a better person. I don't think your punishment was excessive.

I would *hope* that there are *always* consequences at home beyond suspension. Suspension isn\u2019t to punish the kid who did something wrong. How the hell are they gonna learn a lesson by just staying at home or working in the office for a bit? Suspensions are for the sake of the ones bullied, or the ones wronged, so the offending kid doesn\u2019t simply get to waltz back into their world the very next day. \n\nThe school\u2019s hands are extremely tied when it comes to consequences. **Schools are not parents. It is still a parent\u2019s job to parent their children.** I am not sure how this message somehow got lost in modern society.\n\nOP, I would also have an honest conversation with your daughter about the natural consequences of her actions. Don\u2019t mention why you left your ex, but make her aware that other people will always be watching the way she conducts herself. How she behaves gives people an impression about the kind of person she is, and those can be difficult to change. Behaviour like this could very well affect her relationships in the future. \n\nNo one is going to tell you the reason you didn\u2019t get hired at the job you thought you were perfect for is because someone who works the company  saw you be a dick to a girl with autism in high school. They\u2019ll just pass on your application and you\u2019ll be none the wiser. This genuinely happens *all the time.* I\u2019ve personally witnessed it on multiple occasions. \n\nAlternatively, being a good person affords you opportunities that people who aren\u2019t kind don\u2019t even know they\u2019re missing out on. Like being offered and recommended for jobs they didn\u2019t even apply for, because someone stuck their neck out to give them a leg up. No one wants to stick their neck out to vouch for someone who might end up in Human Resources at any moment for asshole behaviour. \n\nSame goes with dates. Go to Reddit and every single time the question comes up about \u201cwhat\u2019s an immediate turnoff,\u201d the top answer includes someone who is mean to people for no reason. And they\u2019re not gonna tell you, they\u2019re just gonna ghost you, or not invite you to the next outing.  On the other hand, when you\u2019re kind and genuine, people will often go out of their way to talk you up or introduce you to people or invite you to things. Nobody wants to be the one who brought the asshole to the party. \n\nKindness has value in society. Humility has value in society. Being a mean person only had social value with other mean people, so they can feel better about themselves. You are a reflection of the five people you spent the most time with. Ask her to think long and hard about the people she spends the most time with at school, and if they\u2019re worth becoming someone society doesn\u2019t appreciate.", "This.

That\u2019s boot camp material to me. \n\nIn my opinion, bullying creates school shooters. If parents learned to discipline their children firmly when it comes to bullying, or schools took these complaints seriously, imo kids wouldn\u2019t feel the need to shoot up a classroom to get revenge. \n\nI think you went easy on her.

She's your daughter as well as your ex wife's and bearing that in mind, you have every right to punish that disgusting behaviour your daughter has, unfortunately when she's with mom, I don't think she's going to see much improvement in her behaviour generally but there's no harm in you trying to show your daughter the severity of the situation.   \nPlease do talk to your daughter though, I don't mean shout at her, she's old enough and fully capable of understanding her behaviour at that age and it being inappropriate, but do try and reinforce that in her if you haven't already. \"Just a joke\" will not save you later in life, one misstep and she could get beaten up for comments like that if she says it to the wrong person.", "NTA - It is not a joke. To say it's a joke belittles the damage that words can cause especially to someone that may already have self-esteem or self-worth issues. Bullying is a huge problem in our nations schools and have had large roles in children seeking to self-harm. It should always be taken very seriously.\n\nA suspension is a school level punishment, basically a cooling off period hoping that a child can return to school with a better attitude for fear of their future being clouded by being 'a troubled student' it is usually very ineffective at actually teaching a lesson. \n\nA parent's responsibility is to teach their child how to be a good citizen and treat those around them with care and empathy. If you must punish a child to drive this lesson home then sometimes those actions are necessary. I would however suggest at least discussing with your daughter why this is destructive behavior. Perhaps seek some counciling, if you are in a position to. Obviously your daughter is going through something and needs to find an outlet that isn't harmful to others. \n\nNTA - I hope you can find a solution to help your daughter.", "NTA\n\n You don't get an Out of School suspension for a couple of jokes. There's likely been a pattern.\n\nSecond off, an OSS isn't a punishment for the kid. It's a vacation, and if she learns that \"Just make fun of the special needs kid, get a few days off\", you're going to be seeing a lot more.\n\nI would make sure your daughter is miserable. All homework needs to be done, all housework (cleaning the kitchen, etc) go to her, etc. \"Here's a toothbrush, clean the bathroom\", etc.\n\nI would ask the school if this has been a pattern, and also see if there's a way to have her serve in school suspensions instead in the future. Tell them that you want to know of any future incidents of bullying ASAP.\n\nFinally, consider therapy. There's likely an empathy gap.\n\nMy kid had a similar thing. He has an anxiety disorder and sensitivity to loud noises, and we thought that him going after the autistic kid in his class was because this kid had a very loud verbal tic, and he was just reacting that way because he didn't feel like he had any other options. As a result, we started with kid gloves, trying to get him to use his IEP accommodations like hearing protection, or a room he can go to for quiet, etc. \n\nHis behavior got worse, culminating with him waving to get a teacher's attention, shoving the kid, and then asking if he could get suspended. It only got better when we got the school to stop giving him out of schools, and instead giving him In Schools. Plus an adjustment to his meds, and making him miserable at home when he did stuff like that.", "NTA.\n\nSuspension's barely a punishment nowadays to begin with. All doing nothing would do is act as a tacit approval.\n\nIf you missed lessons in the past, you were pretty well fucked if you weren't just going over old work. \n\nNot to mention dealing with parents that suddenly had to figure out what to do with you, fucking up their schedule. You know, back when parents were allowed and expected to beat the everloving out of their kids.\n\nAt this point, shit's basically a reward for foing bad if your parents don't punish you in some way.", "NTA. Some consequences are enough to learn the lesson in the behavior. But discrimination is not OK and suspension does not drive that home.

Even if she\u2019s just helping a preschool teacher or doing playground duty or something like that. It would give her an opportunity to see children in a different light, and provide some assistance to those in need.  The reason I suggest children younger than her is it might not be so uncomfortable for her or seen as a serious punishment. She might be more willing to get involved with younger children.\n\nIt\u2019s going to take some work to undo the negative impact of her mom or others. Teenagers are naturally a little bit selfish.

She accepted a collect call that cost me $200 and I was a single mom.", "not at all I have an autistic 7-year-old and people look at him all the time when we are out, if someone was bullying him i would lose it, i agree keep the punishment and make her do a paper, but the sad part is the damage to her by your wife is already done.", "The Dad did right. I found out recently that making fun of someone with a disability is a hate crime under Article 601. Disability act. I found out because a pastor was making fun of my autism and they said I could have him prosecuted where he can get 20 years in prison and because his kids were doing it too, they could also go to jail, down to age 7. 99.99% of lawyers do not understand this. Let the girl be lucky that is the only action the school and her dad did.", "You can tell her that taking away her electronics and grounding her is \"just a joke\" and when she can figure out how to unwind \"her joke\" so that the disabled person is not still hurt by it, then you can talk about \"your joke\"  --- Also, I'd save all the texts and whatever else you have from that lovely ex of yours, and use it to get full custody.  Any mother who defends this and is ok with a suspension is not the parent for your child.", "NTA. How is suspension enough? Yeah, she doesn\u2019t get the social interaction she\u2019d get from school and staying up on hw or however that works Im sure is difficult too, but otherwise, she\u2019d just be able to chill all day, text her friends while they\u2019re in class and have fun. You need to punish her with the suspension so she actually has a punishment from not being in school.", "As a mother of an autistic child, thank you for parenting your child and showing her that things like these are not 'just a joke'.\n\nNTA", "I applaud your additional punishment.  I would also have your daughter hand-write a note of apology to the autistic girl and her family.  \n\nI credit the school for taking action, but am really disappointed in your daughter and ex-wife.  Our lives could change in the blink of an eye - a car accident could leave us paralyzed...a virus could leave us fighting to breath and have long-term consequences.  The difference between the  autistic child and your daughter is that the autistic child did not choose to be autistic but your child chose to be a bully.", "NTA, this is called parenting", "Bullying is not good at all ever. Making a \"joke\" about someone with autism? Yeah that is worse. Punishing her for doing it is a good idea. When we punish kids for wrong doing that is a good thing. Hopefully she learns to be a better person than her Mom.", "NTA! As a parent of a child who is autistic and has been developmentally delayed his whole life, the bullying was terrible. Bullying was so bad that he did his Senior year of high school online just to get away from the kids. Your ex is the one who has wrong attitude about the situation. but as you pointed out, she does the same thing and bullies other people.", "Bro this is what parenting is. School punishment and then home consequences. NTA", "It wasn't a joke, it was bullying.  The fact that she doesn't understand the difference is the problem and what needs to be addressed.\n\nThe punishment is fine and deserved, you are NTA for that.  The punishment won't serve its purpose though because she doesn't believe what she did is wrong and that attitude is being reinforced by your wife.\n\nNot sure how to get through to your daughter, but if you don't have anyone else talk to the school counselor to see if they have any ideas", "NTA. A suspension punishes no one. Oh no, she can't go to school. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "NTA. Your house, your daughter, your rules. You determined what discipline does or does not take place in your home. Your ex does not have to like it, but this is not child abuse in any way and there is nothing she can do about it. When your daughter is at her place then she can determine the rules your daughter is to follow at her place.   \n\n\nIt's funny how any time someone decides to be mean to someone else, it was only a joke. At what point did people start to forget that a joke is only funny when both people involved are laughing. Otherwise it just makes one person a victim and the other an asshole. Ask your daughter and the ex what they think the punchline of this joke is since they seem to be the only ones who get the joke. If they can't explain the joke and why it's funny then extend your daughter's punishment until she either turns 18 and moves out or learns to be a decent human being and has proven that she has redeemed herself.", "NTA. \u201cJust a joke\u201d can mean so many things that it\u2019s a terrible way to dismiss something. She needs to learn that \u201cjust jokes\u201d can really hurt people, and if this \u201cjoke\u201d was enough to blurt her suspended, I bet it was pretty bad. Frankly dismissing it like that is worse in my mind. Suspension is just time without schoolwork if the parents won\u2019t punish the kid. \n\nThere is nothing you can do when she\u2019s with your ex, but you absolutely can punish her while she\u2019s with you.", "NTA\n\nAs a teacher, the suspension is not a punishment, it\u2019s the time for the punishment. The punishment is what she receives at home to make sure she doesn\u2019t act out at school like this again.\n\nBravo OP, you are doing a good job of trying to raise your daughter to be a respectful person. Make sure she understands that the \u201cjoke\u201d wasn\u2019t a joke, was insulting and bullying, and isn\u2019t something she should be doing.", "NTA - As a mother of an autistic child and a sister of one I applaud you for reinforcing to her that this is not appropriate behavior. I cannot tell you how many times disabled people have to deal with discrimination and bullying. This was one of my fears as my child grew up. Although the suspension by the school and banning her electronics/grounding are good deterrents, I have a different suggestion. Volunteering for an organization that supports people with developmental disabilities may be an eye opener for her. Most states and communities have these. If she spends some time with those that are developmentally disabled, she might find out that they are not all that different from her. They just want to be accepted for who they are.", "NTA.  You fulfilled your responsibility as a parent.", "Yes I think you should punish her along with the suspension. She is 16 , she should have more  empathy for some one who has a problem. The other child DID NOT ASK TO BE DIFFERENT AND HAVE AUTISM.  MAKE HER DO SOME COMMUINTY  SERVICE ALSO", "So he\u2019s to blame for checks note not staying married to a asshat", "As someone who's mildly autistic (I really don't struggle with it like I used to socially) and used to get bullied in school, I hope your boys are doing ok. Tell them to keep their heads up and their hearts open. And that no matter what they feel inside, even if they can't quite comprehend the concept, their wonderful mother will always love them.", "Excellent point on the suspension being to protect the victim.  And with how schools are in not doing anything about a bullying situation, I have a feeling the daughter has done this several times, and the victim's family final gave the school an ultimatum to do something.  And now that the daughter has been suspended, the next step could be expulsion.  And that goes into her permanent record, so good luck finding a decent school in the area that will take her for her final year or two of high school.", "such great points.  People never forget how they feel as a result of your actions toward them.  It costs nothing to be kind, nothing to be helpful.  The social cost of being a bully eventually is extremely high.", "Both of my kids got suspended on the same day once and it was hard labor at my house. I had to be to work at 6AM that day, they were given a very long list of chores, and had to be up and at them before I left for work. I called every 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and asked what was done and what was left and kept adding more work. They learned really quick that suspension is not a day off at my house.", "Yes they do, If they see you as a leader or part of the \"in crowd\" they do until they're forced to stop.", "Yes. 100%. I do not care about his happiness. I care about what is best for his daughter. If you want to be happy, try harder or take choosing a spouse more seriously.", "I think it is never a good idea to talk negatively about your ex to your kid.  OP can talk about mean behavior, bullying, and the consequences, without referencing his daughter's mom.  Daughter can figure that out on her own as she matures.", "It is absolutely not best for his daughter to live with 2 parents who are unhappy being together. What kind of back ass world do you live in?", "You are truly as dense as a bag of bricks if you think the mother still wouldn\u2019t have influence.", "Suspension won't do a thing and grounding punished me more than my child. In the end, what you want is for your daughter to develop empathy and internalize what bullying means and all the repercussions that go with it.  What was very effective with my oldest son when I wanted him to really understand whatever the offense was, was writing a report.  I'd have her write a researched report of what bullying is, all the aspects of bullying - - what are the ramifications, why someone bullies and what choices would she make in the future.  I'd find a relevant story (there are plenty!!) of someone who was bullied and suffered a tragic outcome because of it, have her read it and and then have it be a discussion where you can ask questions and assess her understanding of it.  Make a copy of her report... one for her and one for you.  Be calm and nonpunitive when you explain this to her and make sure she understands that this is not a punishment, but that as a parent it is your job to make sure she has the skills to go out into the world; that if she still chooses to bully then at least she will understand exactly all that it means.  (I would expect a report on bullying to be a good 2 pages with a normal size font and single spacing.)", "Nta. You need to show your daughter the harsh reality what her bullying could cause someone to do. It's in news papers, on social media. It's so sad. Nta at all id even go as far as making her do some community service - help in a soup kitchen or pick up trash", "NTA. Your daughter is 16 and is close to entering the real world where no one cares if it was just a joke. Bullying is also unacceptable.", "NTA. I would have absolutely done the same. You do not make fun of others for being different than yourself. On the other end of things it\u2019s ALMSOT hard to be upset because she has one parent teaching her this shit is okay. But hopefully she learns her lesson and the consequences for being a full blown bully. But makes you wonder who else and how many others she has treated like absolute trash and just wasn\u2019t told on or caught. I\u2019d also revisit court about custody because clearly her mother should NOT have her half the time if this is the way she is raising her to be.\nMy personal take as a mother of four.", "NTA. If anything, you were too easy on her.", "Excellent parenting!  If you don't take things away she'll just have a Facebook vacation!", "I feel you were totally in the right to take away her other things, being suspended and then home with her electrics is no punishments.  What good it there if she gets to be home and have all her devices", "**NTA!  She's 16, she should know better.**", "Nope. NTA and Suspension is not enough. Your wife sounds horrid and your mom needs to stay in her lane or kick rocks.  You should have a sit down with your daughter and ask her why she thinks its ok to bully someone with Autism or really why she thinks its ok to be a bully.", "He was justified for punishing her that way.  She needs to learn that bullying is unacceptable, especially to someone who is autistic.  She definitely got this from her mom, and if her mom does not correct her, then in the future, she will always have problems whether it's a workplace, college, relationships etc.", "NTA.  Sounds like your ex is trying to be her friend, not her mother.  I saw a video once of a woman shaving her daughter's head in front of her entire class at school.  Want to know why?  Because her daughter had made fun of a classmate who had cancer and was undergoing chemo and had lost her hair.  Making fun of someone who is disabled or very sick like that is lower than low.  And suspension is just a short vacation from school for kids these days.  Back when I was in school if I got suspended my parents had a HUGE chore list waiting for me every morning I had to stay home, and I better have it all done by the time they got home from work.  If not I'd lose priveleges for that night. (Staying up until 10 to watch my shows, phone priveleges, etc.  These days too many people are too soft on kids.  They think that reasoning with a kid is enough.  Which is EXACTLY why kids these days are getting away with too much and growing up entitled.  I think you were plenty tough enough in this case and that your ex needs to be a mother and stop trying to be her buddy.", "NTA, 1000%.\n\nYour wife is definitely TA. And I've honestly never understood how suspending a kid from school was considered punishment? Granted that it sucks to be stuck with no electronics. But other than that, most kids are like \"extra couple days off? Yes, please.\"", "Nta. does your daughter even care that she was suspended?! most kids that age could care less, a break from school. you did telling her you dont accept her behavior", "NTA but I seriously believe suspension or other punishments is not enough when bullying is concerned. I'd consider therapy because she's probably acting out for a reason. I was bullied in middle school by a girl whose parents were divorced and she didn't get along with her step parents. I wish someone had gotten her help. She was really self conscious.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not wrong to expect your daughter to be a better person.", "NTA. Make her do community service as well. Something where she is forced to interact with people from different life experiences than her and where she'll be reprimanded for acting out.", "NTA.  In my day, long, long, long time ago, if you were suspended it was a province wide suspension.  You couldn't return to school until the next term!  In-school punishment was with a ping pong paddle IN FRONT OF THE CLASS!  There was also the corner with a dunce cap on..........in class.  Talk about being shamed in class!  Whew!!  No one had it happen twice.  And, other students watching this learned a hard lesson vicariously.  Now, it's \"bad for self-esteem\" to punish this way.  Didn't kill my self esteem.  It taught me a huge lesson.   As for all of this self esteem philosophy, your daughter doesn't have any self esteem....which is why she's a bully.......to increase her own self esteem; to make herself feel better at the expense of others.  And, like other comments, those who got it in school could expect more of the same at home.  Trust me, any punishment in class happened early in the first term, and NO ONE forgot it!  (See?  I STILL remember it with a chuckle and I am 76 years old!!!)  I still remember Mr. Crane with great fondness.  He was a straight shooter, kind and gentle.  But, he made a short speech at the beginning of the year telling you his class rules.....and what would happen if you broke the rules.  I went through educational culture shock when my family returned to the U. S and I started in Junior high school.  Student behavior was just unbelievable and now it's even worse.  Good for you for putting your foot down, and keep it down!", "have her killed and locked up", "NTA. Suspension is not enough. The kid needs to know that bullying will be condemned at home as well.", "NTA. I have autism (undiagnosed until adulthood) and it was literal hell at times when I was in school. That has stuck with me my entire life and I still struggle with trust issues (people would act like my friend then make fun of me) as well as my self worth. You did the right thing. \n\nAlso, maybe get her into a program where she can volunteer and learn about those of us with special needs. You can turn this into more than a punishment and make her a better person by educating her and giving her firsthand experience working within the community. She should also apologize to the girl the bullied.", "have her shamed and disowm her and have your wife killed by a hitman", "The old adage, \"no pain no gain\" applies here. The other old adage, \"it was just a joke, or I was just joking\" is an excuse (when called out) More often than not, the teasing or bullying is not a joke at the time. This young lady will long remember the grounding and being \"off the grid\" without her phone and other devices much longer than a mere \"suspension.\" = \"the pain\"", "It sounds like you will be going through some more of this offensive behavior with your daughter over the next few years, even through her adulthood, if she feels like your ex in that such a behavior is ok if it is just a joke.  Problem is, as the father knows, it is not a joke to the person being tormented and that is a sad position to be in when your own kid's behavior is not appropriate and you just may not have the capability to truly work with her on it.  However, try to offset you ex's teachings with your teachings and don't get too discouraged, you might get through one day.", "No, you are definitely NTA! Instead, you are the kind, considerate human being trying your best to raise a like-minded individual. I really feel for the victim who was the target of your daughter's malicious teasing. I really hope with the extra punishment you doled out that your daughter will see the error of her ways,", "Breaks my heart that she ridiculed and autistic student.  They are already overly sensitive and crying inside because they want friends and just don't know how to socialize.  You should make her research autism as part of her punishment.", "NTA - When I was that age, I lived in the country.  When I got suspended, I had to move a crazy big pile of dirt 30 feet to the left. Sun up to sun down every day of the suspension. If my kid got suspended, we did what you did, grounded and no electronics. Good job, bud. I hope she learns something.", "NTA I\u2019m autistic and IMO she should have to learn more about what it\u2019s like and stop being ableist. I feel bad for her, your wife clearly got to her.", "NTA \n\nYou are the father, you can discipline your daughter in a way you think it's right. Bullying is not ok under any circumstance whatsoever. And it's a pity that your ex believes her daughter should treat people in such a manner.", "I (15f) am telling you you\u2019re NTA. That girl needs to be disciplined.", "NTA.  Joking or not, it is not nice to be mean to anyone regardless of who they are.", "NTA! This is a pattern that needs to be broken. She's a narcissist in the making! You probably don't have a dog in the fight though because clearly her mother coddles her feelings because she grooming her mini-me. She needs a tough lesson that you cant always use the \"it was a joke\" card when you hurt someone. You know what they say about Karma!", "My school did normal suspensions, but they also did in-school suspension which sucked wayyyyyy worse. You'd go to school in the morning, and instead of hanging out with your friends before class, you had to go straight to ISS. The ISS room was a room with no windows and a bathroom. Around the perimeter of the room were wooden cubicles with a built in desk, all facing the wall, with a big divider between you and your neighbor. All day your teachers would send you work for whatever the lesson was that day, and then mind numbing busy work once you were done with that. Lunch was brought to us. We were not allowed to leave the room for the entire school day. It was absolute torture. I would have much preferred out of school suspension.", "Agreed, 100%.  My ex was VERY similar to the OP's but I always let it slide due to her upbringing - I made a huge mistake.  By the time I decided to start saying stuff to her about it it was too late and I was TA.  Glad that portion of my life is over.", "Probably not, but it probably wasn\u2019t as profound until it was around their daughter. Things are easily ignored until you see it being taught to your child.", "It\u2019s mainly for the school\u2019s benefit - the teachers and other students get a break from the badly-behaving kid (it also is a legacy from the days when most households had a sahm who would presumably be making little Susie or Johnny accompany her on errands and do chores all day, and should probably be phased out now that most families have every parent working and nobody who can easily watch a suspended kid).", "And the mother should be court ordered to attend not only parenting classes but also community service involved with those who have autism. Under supervision so she can be reprimanded if she says something not appropriate.", "Actually, jobs and college both accept that kind of behavior, ever heard of a sorority or fraternity?", "Exactly. Only way suspension works is if you miss something like an field trip.", "My friends kid was suspended the other day. Took all the gsme systems and locked the wifi. Kid got so bored that when my friend got gome from work, the kid had actually cleaned their room. You dont need a a stay at home parent. You just have to use your brain.", "I know right?

I got in-school suspension once as a kid for hitting another girl who was making fun of me (basically the situation with OP\u2019s daughter, but if her victim went off on her and got in trouble for it) and it was probably the best day of sixth grade.\n\nNone of the other children were allowed to talk to me! I got to sit in a study carol by myself and do all my schoolwork and then color and read books when I was finished without ever having to interact with any of the other kids. I even got to eat lunch in a separate room by myself.
