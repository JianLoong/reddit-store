Suspension from school isn\u2019t enough because she needs to know that you aren\u2019t condoning her behaviour and to get suspended it must have been pretty serious.", "NTA.  It's good that daughter realizes that she's in trouble with the center of moral learning -- i.e., the home -- as well as with the school, which is enforcing \"in society\" manners.  \n\nDon't fret about ex's reaction; you and she dissolved your partnership, and don't have to agree on child-rearing techniques.", "Nta. It's your job to make sure rhat she knows what she did was wrong, and why. Punishment is part of that, but on its own won't help her be a better person. I don't think your punishment was excessive. The school punished her, as the institution where the behavior occurred. As a parent, you also show her your disapproval."]}
