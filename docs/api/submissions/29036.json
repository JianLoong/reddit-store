It has taken us a long time to get here, as I struggled with infertility issues so while the pregnancy was wanted, it was a surprise when it  occured.  My due date falls  a week before my husband's best friends wedding,  two hours away from where we live. My husband is the best man.\n\nWhen I mentioned to my husband he likely couldn't attend, he didn't seem to understand. I told him how it was still too far out to know, but there was a real possibility I would be waiting for labor to begin, in active labor or just getting home at this time. I told him I didn't feel comfortable with him being that far away in any of those situations, but he seemed to take it as a joke. He has made comments about getting a \"private jet\" back if I go into labor that day or just sending his mom over to help me if I am a few days post partum.\n\nI understand this is an important event to him, but with the unknown I am not comfortable confirming he can go at this point and I am looking for reassurance he understands that. I understand I could likely go into labor early, giving a long enough window I would feel more comfortable with him leaving me for a period of time (8-ish hours, returning back and not staying over), but that's the only situation I see that is possible for him to attend.\n\nClarity: I am not trying to say he can't go 100%. I am asking him to understand there are very real situations that mean he may not be able to go whether the baby is here or not. Pregnancy complications would void the idea he could go if the baby is here. Doctor saying \"baby is coming any day\" or \"you are high risk\" would void him being able to go if baby isn't here.  No signs of labor on that day, early delivery where I would be home and settled for a week-ish with other support completely okay! It just seems like I am being forced to shoulder the burden and the anxiety of a very complicated situation vs. have my feeling validated that we may not know what's going to happen now but there needs to be a real, yet flexible plan.\n\nClarification: The wedding is 5 days AFTER my due date and  FTM usually go longer than 40 weeks.\n\nResponse: I think all the comments here are helping me get to my perspective and I've selected poor language in my OP- it's not really the logistics here for me of if it should be two days before he can go, our two days after. It's the willingness and emotional support to figure out the best plan. Do I think my needs are higher than his best friend's yes. But i understand reading these comments that that also may minimize my husband's needs. This might make me sound like more of TA but I am just looking for reassurance that he understands  and wants to prioritize me especially if there are ways I can still see it working. I agree I should not have come at it from a place of \"no\" that was dictacted by fear and trying to control the unknown which is my responsiblility.", "created_utc": 1697460647, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/179591u/aita_for_making_my_husband_miss_his_best_friends/", "score": 1546, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My first was born 9 days late and I was hospitalized two days before giving birth. Next child popped out 9 days early. You never know. You also can't anticipate problems. That second child who appeared so quickly had to go back to the hospital after a seizure and then spent 11 days in the hospital. \n\nBy not being in the wedding party, your husband could attend the service but come home before the reception. If you went into labour, he could see that someone else was with you so that he could rush home. With a first baby there will likely be sufficient time for him to make it back\n\nAs long as your husband does not have Best Man duties, he has a lot of flexibility.", "My husband went 3 hours away to work while I was almost due - the deal was he wasn\u2019t to drink because if I went into labour he had to be able to drive home. \nCompromise \ud83d\ude0a", "NAH. But I don\u2019t think you need to make a decision now. If you are in labour on the day of the wedding then obviously he shouldn\u2019t go. But if you are more than a couple days PP, or still waiting for labour, then maybe let him go\n\nETA: I made a brief comment, but to be clear i definitely think OP\u2019s husband would be an asshole if he went in the aftermath of a complicated birth or against her wishes if she needed emotional support. The husband is veering closer to asshole territory than OP", "My friends were in this exact same situation and her husband didn\u2019t want to go to the wedding but she urged him to. If you start contractions he can come back, normally you don\u2019t give birth within 2 hours of the start of contractions. \n\nWhy can\u2019t he just confirm that he\u2019s going and closer to the date if needed call it off? I\u2019m sure his best friend would understand. And don\u2019t you have anyone else to be with you to ease your mind while he\u2019s gone? I don\u2019t wanna say you\u2019re the AH because it\u2019s more of a NAH but you both need to try to think in solutions.", "Hard NTA\n\nThis is your first birth, yes? Pack your bags a month before, because anything can go.\n\nGenerally first births are 1-2 weeks \u201clate,\u201d so you fall in dead center of the Countdown. A two hour drive? What if you have an emergency? I\u2019d run a list of things by, but don\u2019t want to imprint that on you. The truth is he has no business going to that wedding. The day your pregnancy was confirmed and your date given, he should have given his friend a call, and declined the invite. I am, of course, assuming that he would not be the idiot who agreed after you both knew you were pregnant.\n\nIn L&D, a lot could go down in 2 hours. Long term - in 10  years, which would he remember more: his child, or a wedding?\n\nPlus, if you manage to deliver prior to the wedding, __you__ could have complications. You will definitely need help, even the episiotomy can make things difficult. You might have a 10 lb limit on you to avoid uterine prolapse. You don\u2019t want that. Who is going to cover if your husband is gone?\n\nCould you ask your doctor or his charge nurse to call him? That might just cut to the chase.\n\nGood luck!\n\nEdit:  added delivery question", "I\u2019m amazed that there are people voting Y T A. I imagine there\u2019s a lot of teenagers on this subreddit. Committing to be a best man in a wedding when your wife is within days of her due date is dumb at best, shows a total lack of empathy at worst. And for everyone saying that there will be time for him to get home if OP goes into labor, that\u2019s likely true. But then husband is forced to bail on the wedding at a moments notice leaving his friend without a best man. If husband had any sense he should tell his friend \u201c I would be honored to be your best man, but I can\u2019t commit because of the potential timing of the birth of our child. I would love to come to the wedding and celebrate nonetheless, knowing that there is a chance that I may have to bail on rather short notice.\u201d NTA", "Did he agree to be best man before you got pregnant? He maybe should have bowed out when you got your due date.", "NTA. But you aren't making him miss the wedding. You don't need to decide now. Frankly, if you plan in advance, you could decide on the day.\n\nBut I think you & he--probably together with whatever family might be recruited to help--need to make plans in advance on how to handle various scenarios. \n\nStart out by letting him know that chances are good that you will have given birth & be back home again. And that with some help it will probably be OK for him to go.\n\nTalk about the scenarios that you should plan for together.\n\nOne of them is that you are in labor. Another is that you &/or the baby are in N/ICU. Another that you & baby have just come home. \n\nHe also needs to let his best friend know of the possibility, so they can make some alternative plans, or work out how to do the wedding without your husband.", "> I understand that this is an important event to him. \n\nUnlike the birth of his first child which he is willing to pawn off on his mom so he doesn't miss his friend's wedding. Think about that. NTA", "A lot can happen in two hours. I wouldn\u2019t have wanted my husband that far away at the start of labor. Sure, he might not miss the actual birth, but you do want support for the start of labor as well", "NTA \n\nOne being near your very very pregnant wife trumps other events. \n\nTwo,  you have a couple day old baby, and he brings home a cold or Covid or rsv, your neonate may end up with a hospital stay. It\u2019s very serious for a young baby to get sick.\n\nThree, if he brings home covid or rsv or a cold to you, you may have a much harder labor or be masking / quarantining from your baby. \n\nFrankly he needs to get with being responsible now.", "NTA. I wouldn't be comfortable with my hubby being so far away at such an important time of our lives. I also know his best friend would be a bit disappointed but would understand. \n\nIt's so easy to say he is only a few hours away but there are so many what ifs that could fuck up him making it home for the birth.", "NTA.  Being a childbearing person is terrifying.  Although it seems perhaps unthinkable where you are, I would plan  for an elective induction at 39 weeks.  https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1800566#:~:text=In%20summary%2C%20we%20found%20that,fewer%20instances%20of%20cesarean%20delivery.\n\nAlso, it seems like you need your partner to make a plan for the possibility that he can\u2019t go.  In order to do that, he need to accept that it\u2019s a possibility.  Once he sees that, he should see that having a plan is kind to both you and the groom.  \n\nHe also needs to know that not being there for the birth of the child is a major failure on his side of the marriage.  It\u2019s not as bad as cheating, but it\u2019s close.  Your marriage may not bounce back.  If all he provides is financial support and no emotional support, you\u2019ll do fine with a divorce settlement.  Be firm with your boundaries.  \n\nFinally, you should make a plan to get him out for the wedding.  If you get induced, it will be two weeks postpartum.  You are going to be miserable, only sleeping in two hour slots.  Organize your support team to get him there for the rehearsal dinner and the ceremony.  He doesn\u2019t need to be gone for the week.  Also, set clear expectations with the support people that they are there to help you with the house and food so you can take care of the baby.  They are not there to hold the baby during waking hours.  \n\nClear is kind.  Set your boundaries but talk about them.", "NAH as I think you guys are actually both saying the same thing in different ways. You are just wanting him to acknowledge the possibility of having to miss the wedding IF you are already in labor or should you have just given birth (a few days after he should still be able to attend for a bit). You aren\u2019t telling him he can\u2019t go because you MIGHT give birth, correct?  It\u2019s not a blanket ban on the wedding? \n\nAs someone who has birthed two children and also has a husband \u2014 just tell him he can go but if you go into labor you expect his ass to get back even if he\u2019s raising a glass in that moment. And even if you are a few days postpartum I\u2019d still have him go but it becomes a same day trip. No big wedding weekend blow out obviously. MIL at home for one day to help should be fine. It might not be your perfect scenario but he\u2019s a best man at his best friends wedding. It\u2019s a big deal. \nI think both these events can easily coincide and be fine.", "My spouse would only have gone 2+ hours away during my last 6 weeks of pregnancy for an emergency. A wedding is not an emergency.\n\n**This is being an adult. This will be the first, but not the last, time he has to sacrifice his fun time for what is best for his child.**\n\nNTA\n\n**Re: edit: he is 100% the asshole if goes while you are 5 days after your due date or if he goes and your child has already been born.** ***Be better, dad.***", "NTA. Seems like most people are responding to what you should or shouldn\u2019t do rather than what you\u2019re *feeling* \n\nYES GIRL. Your feelings are valid. By reading your responses it\u2019s clear you want to and will compromise. You just want hubby to appreciate that your feelings are understandable. We don\u2019t argue with feelings. Only what we do with those feelings. \n\nTry to explain this to hubby. Not that you don\u2019t want him to go. Just that you want him to understand the emotional landscape of this for you. \n\nI imagine he thinks you\u2019re flat out asking him not to go, and you think he is flat out ignoring your concerns. This is a miscommunication. \nYou\u2019re both talking about different things and not hearing each other as a result. This is complicated but i think I\u2019m seeing it because my husband and I went to marriage counselling because we communicated past each other like this for years. \n\nBoth of your *feelings* are valid. Full stop. \n\nIt would likely go a long way if you could sit him down and fully validate where he is coming from. No re-directing to how you\u2019re impacted. Let him be heard without any back and forth. Affirm all his thoughts and fears as understandable. \nThen in a separate conversation tell him you need the same thing from him. \nAfter you\u2019re both heard you can move forward as a team to figure out the logistics of this situation. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re feeling scared, set aside, less important than your husbands best friend, and worried you\u2019ll be alone during labour. Those are valid feelings.", "NTA If he wants to risk missing his childs birth thats on him. Even if the chance is small, its not ZERO.\n\nDoes his best friend know? Will he be able to leave the party if you went into labor? \n\nYou are worried and he is basicly laughing at it. Tal to him again. Explain your worries. If you are scared, be honest. \n\nWill you still look at him the same way if he misses the birth?", "NTA, your husband is. \n\nMany things can happen during childbirth, and you may need someone to drive you to the hospital in the middle of the night, or take an ambulance (which *he* should pay for if he's not there), if certain things happen. You don't *know* when the baby will come, and you don't know if there will be an emergency. You can't afford to wait 2 hrs in an emergency. \n\nYour husband seems very lax. Did he not want to have children?", "NTA but I do have experience in this! I had this happen to me! We struggled to get pregnant (infertility, many losses, late term losses etc) finally pregnant and everything looked great, husband had been asked to be best man a week before my due date. We went ahead with things and kept the groom up to date. Had a backup plan for groomsmen to read best man speech etc. I had a backup plan to have my mom with me just incase he couldn\u2019t make it back in time. All that to say I ended up being induced the Sunday after the wedding (like the day after the wedding) but I didn\u2019t have my baby until two days after that so we had time (I know that isn\u2019t always the case).\n\n\nWe had some ground rules like for him like no drinking, drive your own car, have someone trustworthy with your phone incase I needed him asap etc. checked in frequently and he drove home the night of the wedding. We also let the groom know we had some rules. He ended up staying until the wedding ended (1am) and drove home. He was tired haha but whatever!\n\nI think it\u2019s worth a discussion if your husband is willing to accept your ground rules and abide by them!", "I think you\u2019ve misunderstood what you\u2019re asking (hear me out) \n\nHubby is the best man. \n\nYou are pregnant and due around the wedding date. \n\nHusband should be stepping down his best man duties and be a groomsman instead, because he may not be able to attend the wedding. \n\nYou are NTA. Your husband will be if he lets his friend down last minute by not being transparent with him, or if he ditches you when you\u2019re in Labour, or in those few days post partum which are arguably the hardest days. \n\nGood luck sorting this out OP and I hope you have a safe and happy delivery \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. Yes wedding is an important symbolic celebration but it\u2019s incomparable with birth. \n\nBirth is a risky medical situation when at best a partner needs support, and at worst she may die. It\u2019s unpredictable, and risky, and all hands on deck. \n\nIt\u2019s very sad to miss the wedding but there isn\u2019t a choice, it\u2019s a duty of a normal partner to be present and ready around the birth time to provide care, support, and practical help. \n\nThe fact that your husband is even entertaining the thought and more than that even agreed to be a best man when he has a duty by your side weirds me out. He should have declined from the get go, doesn\u2019t he know how to use a calendar?\n\nHe can\u2019t leave if you are still expecting, he can\u2019t leave if you are in labour, and he most definitely can\u2019t leave when you just had birth and are recovering, because you won\u2019t be good in the first days in the best of outcomes, and god forbid something goes wrong. Someone has to take care of you and a baby, and this someone is your husband.\n\nThe only excuse I can make for him is that because it\u2019s your first he doesn\u2019t really understand the seriousness of the situation and that\u2019s why he tries to make plans.\n\nN A H crowd perhaps didn\u2019t have their first yet, and doesn\u2019t know how reckless and irresponsible is to plan anything at all around due date.", "NAH. I understand why you\u2019re anxious but it does seem like this can be sorted out with some advance planning.\n\nTwo hours away isn\u2019t a big deal and he can always cancel if you start your contractions or come back quickly if you do once he leaves. \n\nI suggest you talk to him again and work out a plan where he can go as long as your labour hasn\u2019t started and  you guys keep in constant touch while he\u2019s away. It\u2019s also a good idea to keep a relative on standby who can stay with you while he\u2019s away.  \n\nHe should also explain the situation to his friends who will hopefully understand and be as accommodating as they can.", "NTA - it\u2019s upsetting that he\u2019s more excited about the wedding, then his long await child! but I would start making other arrangements, while dropping hints! (Because his private jet joke is so funny!)\n\nOh I\u2019m just checking my mum\u2019s availability that week, as she will now be in the room with me, during the birth.

This isn\u2019t a nightmare story, just a \u201cstuff can change fast\u201d story).\n\nI think you need to tell your husband, \u201cthere is a non-zero chance I will be having a medical emergency and you, as my next of kin and medical decision-maker, will both need and want to be here.

He\u2019s *asking* you. \n\nI feel like he\u2019s be hurt if you assumed he\u2019d be fine with a newborn after he\u2019d had surgery where his dick was ripped open, from the inside, while he was conscious.", "You're about to be parents, you both need to be flexible ALL THE TIME. Literally at every second of every day you both need to be ready to cancel plans in favor of your children's health, safety, or even because your baby cried for HOURS AND HOURS last night and you literally cannot EVEN get out of bed, you're both zombie-ing through the next two days in shifts and social obligations are just **not** a priority. So yes, you're right. NAH, it's time for him to knuckle down on his lag time and be adaptable.", "oh ffs of course you're NTA! It should be plain obvious FOR HIM why he can't go.\n\nEven if nothing happens that night, is a fucking wedding worth leaving your high-risk full-term pregnant wife? Or your few days old miracle baby? It shouldn't even have to be on the table. What's wrong with these guys, smh.", "I would say NTA because you are supposed to be a team. If you are incapable of attending something due to your pregnancy and childbirth then he should follow suit. You are married and chose to create this child together. The pregnancy is happening entirely to your body because of how anatomy works. He should assume the exact level of responsibility as you due to your partnership. He thinks missing one wedding is a big deal, maybe he should take time to think about how much you will have to miss due to your body going through that. How severe the pain of childbirth and postpartum will be. He should make himself completely available to you. People talking about how this wedding is once in a lifetime, it\u2019s a f*cking wedding. It\u2019s completely incomparable to the birth of his firstborn which is ACTUALLY once in a lifetime. Labor complications can be deadly. You need your partner by your side through it all. He\u2019s definitely being selfish and having misplaced priorities. When you\u2019re a parent you have to miss out on a lot of stuff. He should have thought about all that before he put great effort into impregnating his wife.", "I'm going to take a risk here and say he that is being a major AH. This is a long read, so bear with me.\n\nParenting is all about prioritizing one thing over another, doing what you need to do instead of what you want to do, putting your family before yourself. Sure, his best friend's wedding is a once-in-a-lifetime thing - but so is the birth of his child. So are those first few days/weeks of bonding with your new baby and each other. There are always going to be things that come up at the same time and you have to get used to missing out. Sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn't. And when it does work out, it shouldn't be at the expense of your partner/child. Even if he is willing to leave the wedding, is he going to make sure he doesn't drink just in case? Is he going to be checking his phone constantly to make sure there isn't news? Is he going to get there in time? Is he going to arrive safely? If the choice is between your best friend's wedding and your first child with the partner you chose for life, why is that even a conversation? He is incredibly selfish because he will either be leaving his best friend unable to find a new best man in time or leaving his wife to deal with a new baby alone while also recovering from a major physical experience (or operation if you end up having a c-section). Having had 2 children myself, I can guarantee there is NO way you can mentally, physically, or emotionally prepare yourself for the days leading up to the birth, the birth itself, or the weeks after. As much as you think you can, there is NO WAY YOU CAN PREPARE. Your baby might have colic, you might have complications, you could be hit with the baby blues - there are so many variables that could change at any minute.\n\nI can tell you're really trying to be considerate of your husband, and that's a great quality - but it doesn't seem to be a sentiment he shares. At least not in this instance (I can't speak for his usual behavior). Your priority right now shouldn't be what will make your husband happy, though. Your priority should be what's best for you and your baby. And my worry is that if he can't understand that now, then you're probably going to be having a lot more of these types of debates in the future.", "NAH\n\nIt really really sucks that that's the situation, he really should be there for you but to miss a wedding is a major thing as well. I don't know if it'd be worth considering having a remote session for the speech and such but I know that a wedding is more than just a speech, it's a whole day and it's a massive commitment. But at the same time he needs to be there for you during the end stages of your pregnancy\n\nI assume you live in the US so you can't just go there with him and just go to one of the hospitals local over there if it all happens at that point", "NAH. But let him go. Just make sure he can come back fast if needed. He seems to understand that already (the private jet comment).", "I'd say NTA because either you go into labour or you've just given birth, and you need support at home/hospital. I'd say it's reasonable to ask him to stay.", "Yes. This happened to me. My husband went to the wedding 3 hours away and came back right after. You\u2019ll feel bad if nothing happens and he missed out. At least wait til closer to make that decision. You\u2019ll know how dilated you are as it gets closer too.", "What he should do is bow out NOW of being best man in case you go into labor or something happens that he has to cancel due to the baby. He should attend the wedding and be ready to leave in case you do meaning he has to stay sober and/or be able to afford a ride asap.", "I'm really unhappy with your husband. Yes, if baby arrives on schedule, his being the best man is a doable thing.\n\nBut, babies (particularly first babies), are notorious for not follow schedules. It sounds like both of you are OK with him being best man if the baby is on schedule and that the disagreement is what will happen if the baby comes late.\n\nHe proposes is that if the baby is late, that you use a substitute husband (his mother) rather than his friend using a substitute best man. He seems to value supporting his friend in his friend's happy time as more important that him supporting you when you are anxious and scared. His contingency plan favors \"help happy friend\" over \"help scared wife\".\n\nI hope that the kid arrives on time but he's a huge asshole and you are NTA.", "NTA but he is. I missed a couple of events because of my children's impending birth and that's just how it goes. You put your spouse and kids 1st. Period.", "NTA.  Your husband doesn't seem to have any sort of realistic ideas about babies.  They get here when they get here, and that could very easily be the friend's wedding day.  My own cousin opted not to come to my wedding because his daughter was due two days after and she wanted him and her mother nearby.  She gave birth the morning of my wedding, so it was a good call.  I myself am due in about a month, my husband works in office about 1.5-2 hours away (with traffic, and there is always traffic) one day a week, and even that makes me nervous because I could go into labor here by myself, then have to wait for him to fight his way home to drive me to the hospital since it isn't safe to drive when you are having contractions.\n\n\nYour husband needs to understand, there is a kid on the way, his priorities are about to change dramatically, and he needs to take it seriously, and that means telling his friend he might need to have a back-up plan if you go into labor or have just had the baby.  Honestly, he really shouldn't be going out and associating with a big group of people in the middle of cold and flu season anyway if he has a newborn or potential newborn at home.", "I would say that close to the due date he should plan on not attending. Labor is scary, and extremely hard. You\u2019ll need your partner then.", "NTA", "Talk to your doctor.  Explain the situation and ask what the likelihood that you will have the baby on or around due date.  My daughter was 5 days late my son 5 days earlier.  It\u2019s likely that the doctor won\u2019t know now because it\u2019s months away but as it gets closer they may have a better idea.", "I mean everyone in this thread is debating but the reality is at a max of one week past your due date (usually closer to 5 days) your ob will likely induce if you have not gone into labor as studies show greater risk of adverse events after 41 weeks. The reality is, with the wedding 5 days after your due date you will either be home with a fresh newborn in recovery or on your way to welcoming your baby earth side. \n\nBy that point if the baby hasn\u2019t arrived it will be a day by day thing. I don\u2019t see a world where he thinks he can be the best man at this wedding but do agree it will be easier to make your doctor say it, which they no doubt will. NTA", "NTA. There\u2019s probably room for compromise here. But babies are gonna baby. My husband was set to be a best man when I would be 36 weeks. Baby was born 3am day of the wedding. I gave him permission to stop by (it was close to the hospital), but he didn\u2019t want to. \n\nAt the end of the day, you are BOTH becoming new parents. You BOTH are having your lives changed. The timing sucks, but it is what it is. It won\u2019t be the last plan that gets muddied by the presence of your new, needy, but amazingly adorable life.", "NTA. You're being very reasonable. If things go sideways during labor, he might have to make life or death decisions for you *and* your baby. Now, if he understands that and *still* he thinks his responsibility to his BFF outweigh his responsibilities to his wife and child, I'd recommend he go live with his BFF. There's a good chance this will be a non-issue, but it's concerning that he won't agree to step up should he need to.", "NTA. Hubby has to realize that there is a good chance he may not be able to go. If you deliver early and are feeling fine alone, he could definitely go. He needs to accept that maybe it\u2019s a no.", "I suggest you not get your judgement from reddit... because these responses are crazy. As someone who has given birth twice, this wedding just will not work. If you gave birth on your due date, both of you will be utterly exhausted with a week old newborn. You will not want to fend for yourself while he is gone, and honestly he shouldn't be driving two hours, partying, then driving two hours back with that type of sleep deprivation. You will not know how exhausting it is until you actually go through it. Do you have any friends with children who could help explain all this to your husband? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you haven't given birth yet I'd say it's obvious as to why he shouldn't go. Just because he could probably make it back in time for the birth doesn't mean that it's OK for you to be alone for that 2+ hours before he gets there. Labor is scary -start to finish. He should be there with you the entire time (or at least as much as possible). It sounds like you would resent him for going which I think is 100% fair (I would feel the same) so you need to tell him this. Your feelings are valid, even if they aren't 120% logical. You should share this with him, your worries and fears and if he doesn't listen... I don't know man, I don't have advice because I don't think I'd be having this type of conversation with my husband. Good luck and safe delivery!", "If the baby is already here or you are starting labor at that time then I shouldn\u2019t imagine he would want to be anywhere else. You\u2019ve struggled with fertility and this is a huge event. Women still die from childbirth. His joking instead of validating any feelings regarding this would stress me out and make me pretty angry too.", "Definitely NTA. I literally went into labor 5 days after my due date. It was the exact day we had planned to marry, but since the first due date given was about 12 days before the day we planned to wed, we decided to cancel the wedding and go to the courthouse before things got too complicated. Then the due date changed again to 5 days before the initial wedding date and we were glad we had made the decision. That was OUR wedding. It wasn't more important to us than our child. Yes, he may still be able to go, but it is unrealistic for him to expect it to be a sure thing. That is part of being a parent, he needs to get used to it if he plans on being an active partner in this relationship, with both you and your guy's child. Yes, you guys should do your best to make sure he makes it, but it shouldn't come at the expense of you, your comfort or the baby's health and comfort, which are more closely related than he seems to realize. You and the baby are priority over everything else in the world. It's reasonable for you to need validation that he understands that, it's vital, actually.", "I feel like very few people in this thread are not empathetic to how traumatic, frightening & emotional labor, delivery & post partum can be. Could she arrange for other supports? Sure. But it\u2019s completely understandable that you would want your husband, your comfort person to be there through every step. Not to mention large group of people = heightened exposure to illness. Especially with RSV becoming more rampant in recent years + covid surges. All this talk about \u201cit\u2019s only two hours, if you start contractions he should be able to make it in time\u201d. For me personally, I think that\u2019s crap. It\u2019s still scary, painful & your first baby! Dad should be most concerned with his wife/mother of his baby & his baby. The timing is unfortunate for sure, but his response is selfish & priorities are skewed.

My sister 6 days early. My little sister 2 days late. The baby will determine when the birth happens and an understanding friend should accept that someone's wife will need her husband during this time. My sister is literally a week postpartum and she needs her spouse. She doesn't feel good and baby is too new and fresh.", "NTA. Your husband should not be a best man, full stop. If you\u2019re post baby and tired and recovering, he should really be at home with you unless there is family or a close friend that is willing to step in *that you feel comfortable with*. A best man would have several events to attend around a wedding, and either way, that\u2019s a bad idea. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t had the baby, he could attend the wedding as a guest, and be ready to head back asap if things start up. \nA friend recently had her first and had a tight situation with her husband as well. It\u2019s not a good idea to be too far away, emergent situations arise around birth all the time.", "NTA. Pregnancy and birth are not equal. You bear all the burden of it, so the least he can do it be there for you around your due date and not travel. You should not have to have additional stress just because he wants to go to a wedding. If you happen to go into labor while he is gone, you would resent him. What if he misses the birth entirely? How are you going to get to the hospital? Who is going to be there for you? You should be able to rely on your husband for these things, and it sounds like you rank low on his priority list. Which makes me wonder how good of a father and partner he's going to be when the baby is actually here. \n\nNot to mention, what if you have the baby prior to the wedding? Is he going to leave you to do everything alone?", "NTA he isn\u2019t validating that he might not be able to go because in his mind he\u2019s gonna go wether you want him to or not.  If he respected that your due date was so close to that wedding and that pregnancy is hard and you need your partners support, than he would have declined best man.  Or at least made it clear to his best friend that he\u2019s not really sure he will be able to make it this far out.  Your husband doesn\u2019t see being there for you as good responsibility in this and I\u2019m sorry he should.  I worry that this is a pattern of behavior that will continue.  Parenting is hard and requires two active parents to even try to accomplish without burnout.  Many married parents are still alone in active parenting and the burnout is real.  Be careful.  But put your foot down about what is and isn\u2019t acceptable from your spouse in this situation.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is being a major asshole by refusing to acknowledge that there is a *possibility* of him missing this wedding. He is either inexcusably naive, or an asshole. \n\nYou have already clearly voiced your willingness to support him attending the wedding, if both you and the baby are healthy and stable. \n\nHe is claiming that he will go no matter what? So if you\u2019re in the hospital, or the baby is\u2026 he still plans on going? If he leaves you at the most vulnerable moment in your life, that\u2019s a big AH move. \n\nIf he cancels at the last minute, he will screw over his best friend, who is probably counting on a speech. That\u2019s also an AH move.\n\nSo by not planning for contingencies, yes he\u2019s being the asshole. He needs to tell his friend that this is going to be a last minute decision. \n\nThe wedding is a week AFTER your due date. The odds of him not being able to go, are pretty high. He needs to accept reality and plan accordingly.", "NTA but it\u2019s pretty telling he isn\u2019t aware or concerned about the grey areas. He has a huge wake up call coming with a baby", "Oh so glad he cares so little about his child\u2019s birth.

Does he have friends or siblings with kids that he could talk with?", "I am a ftm, I went into labor a week before I was due and in like 5 hours my son was born. Just because you haven't had a kid yet doesn't mean it won't be early or fast. I wouldn't be comfortable with my partner leaving me around my due date and he wouldn't have either. \n\nYour feelings are so valid. \n\nNta", "NAH.\n\nI totally understand your reservations, but it is possible to compromise here and you should be looking to do that. This is a first pregnancy, which can be full of anxiety - but most first time labors & deliveries are long affairs. The venue & wedding are two hours away, not far enough away to present a huge challenge. If he went it would be with high contact avenues in place, he needs to keep his phone on him & loud at all times so he won't miss a call. He could go for just the day. If you do deliver before the wedding he could still go for the one day. You could accept help from whoever you feel most comfortable with for that day.\n\nBoth of these events are once in a lifetime, and with reasonable accommodation he can do both. I wouldn't advise making him pick between them, as it is relationship damaging. \n\nI fully understand your feelings, but in this case you're letting them run over him which is unfair. And it is REALLY hard to stop that habit once it starts, from experience. The first year of momhood is hard, and you don't want to set this as precendent. It can make him feel pushed away & unwillingly distant from both you and the baby, wanting to help but not wanting to get steamrolled by you & walking on eggshells. At worst it can cause resentment, which can fester in a marriage.\n\nStrive for compromise and a healthy beginning to parenthood WITH your husband, rather than having him bend the knee in totality to your impending motherhood. This is a huge milestone in your marriage. Please let your heart hold the baby AND him. \n\nSigned a mom who totally gets your feelings, and accidentally went new mommy feral on my sweet husband for a few months, which he handled beautifully loving me back to sanity the whole time.", "is it a 2 hour drive or 2 hour flight? flight would be out of the question. \n\ndriving if it were my husband (and yes i am pregnant) i would prob say he can go but not stay overnight and keep his phone on him the whole time. \n\nit\u2019s not wild for you two to have to talk this through though. for me this is def not an automatic yes without at least talking it through", "You'll be having a lot of regular appointments with your OB then and they're pretty good at assessing if they think the baby is ready, etc.  \n\nIf he's assuring you that he will be then I wouldn't stress about it but he and his friend should prepare for hte potential that he will either have to miss it or leave.", "NTA simply bc of how he knew your due date and still took the best man role", "NTA at all, and you have a very reasonable perspective on this. To echo your point, the plan needs to be flexible right now. If you've already given birth, you're home from the hospital with no complications, and it's been at least a few days, (and ideally if you have other support, although you probably can make do for a day), then great, he'll go. But as you said, if you haven't yet given birth or you're in labor, then he needs to realize that has to be the priority. It's a gentle AH directed at your husband for me, but I'll give him some benefit of the doubt for cluelessness? \nAlso, I don't know your relationship with your MIL, but if it's a good one and she's \"normal\", hopefully if he suggests to her that she be on call for labor in case he's at the wedding, shell knock some sense into him as well! My MIL would be like \"you're an idiot\" to her son.", "NTA. I think your husband should be more understanding & accommodating of your concerns here rather than joking them off.\n\nAs someone currently pregnant with my first I wholly hear your anxiety. I\u2019d feel deeply uncomfortable having my husband away/committed to something that close to my due date. As you say there are so many possibilities, and no guarantees. Lots of women are induced on medical advice between 38-40w, with that increasingly common as the mother gets older. If you deliver early you\u2019ll need support at home, especially if you have a c section (again, rates are higher for older mothers). I\u2019d be super anxious about needing to head off to hospital solo while in labour. Sure most first time labours are long but I know several people who had rapid (like sub 3hrs start to finish) labours including my SIL x2. \n\nIf it were me I\u2019d have asked my husband to decline the best man job & travel there & back on the day and not stay late / get drunk in case I need him.

Your post makes it seem like he thinks he emphatically can\u2019t go to the wedding. There\u2019s no guarantee that you\u2019ll go into labor when he\u2019s gone. Ask to make a contingency plan in the event you do go into labor while he\u2019s gone. I\u2019m sure his friend would understand if he had to leave in order to be at the birth of his child.", "NTA. A wedding is just a day. My husband's best friend, who would have been his best man, did not attend our wedding because his twins were due around that time. He didn't wait and see, just said from the start he can't come. Many things are more important than a wedding. As the bride and main one doing the planning, I was happy to have a clear headcount so we could plan everything around him not coming, rather than have him be on the fence and making it complicated.", "NAH- but I will say this. My husband was off at a car event and didn\u2019t get home until 1AM. When he got back he was exhausted and I went into labor. I was 3 days overdue. He was so grumpy and tired, he slept at the hospital the whole time and was not helpful at all in the delivery room. It\u2019s something I can never forgive him for. If you go into labor the night of the wedding, chances are he will get home exhausted, hung over or otherwise. If you go into labor before the wedding, with his attitude now, I can imagine he won\u2019t be enthusiastic about missing the wedding. If you\u2019re in the hospital and you\u2019re set to be discharged, what happens if your discharge date is the day of the wedding or even the day before? Is he really willing to leave you alone with the baby and go party with his friends? This is going to set the tone of your relationship going forward.

My wife had a plan to go natural with a due date in Mid august,  but every show from July and into August was made aware that if I just left my booth and took off running,  the people on each side of me had the details of how to pack it up.

How more can he accommodate you concretely?", "why are you acting like he\u2019s going to an entirely different country? he\u2019s going to be 2 hours away, he can just drive back. you\u2019re seriously not letting him go because you *might* go into labor? this is his best friend\u2019s once in a lifetime event and you\u2019re going to make him miss that just because you *MIGHT* go into labor? \n\nlet him go, it\u2019s 2 hours away. put on your big girl pants and just let him go. YTA.\n\nediting to add that a lot of first time births go over the due date, this is what i mean by she might go into labor because it might not even happen at all. my daughter was 10 days past her due date lol", "[deleted]", "NAH - I\u2019d sit down and have a discussion and come up with a game plan. There\u2019s still plenty of time to plan this out properly. Obviously if you go into labor he won\u2019t be going to the wedding, but I wouldn\u2019t have him cancel yet", "Just let him go but no drinking. Attend the wedding, say a toast, then come home. \n\nI\u2019m not going to make a judgement on this, but I think you shouldn\u2019t be concerned about problems until they actually arise.", "NAH. If this is his best friend's wedding and it's only two hours away, you guys should plan for him to go, but with the caveat that he might have to back out of the wedding at the last minute if you're in labor. Make sure the bride and groom understand, and are on board with it. If he can be home in two hours, you would be kind of an AH if you said that he had to skip the wedding if you were still \"waiting for labor to begin\" - unless you are *in* labor, or in the hospital, he can go and come back right away if you need him.", "Gently, YTA. It is close enough that he can attend the event if you have already given birth or not in labor. Obviously if he choses to go to the wedding while you are in active labor that would be an entirely different scenario. But if the baby is already here or you are not yet in labor, do you think he would be standing 24/7 glued to you the entire day for that entire week? But for the newborn baby it is important that you (momma and food) are there, everything else is optional.", "NTA.. but neither is your husband. Just a shit timing for this situation. How far out was the wedding planned? He is the best man, this should have been thought about before he agreed to be the best man. If these are new plans as of right now.. then he has time to decline being best man. If this has been planned for a year.. then that\u2019s really shitty to cancel on his best friend with only a few months notice. However in the end.. who is more important in his life? You and your baby or him and his bear friend?\n\nMaybe as a consideration you should try and get familiar with the hospital that is closer to the wedding venue as a back up plan and just go with him to the wedding. Hopefully you won\u2019t need to use that hospital, but just as a back up plan. \n\nHe should also be considerate of you because giving birth is scary especially the first one because it\u2019s all unknown. He probably should have declined being the best man just out of the entire timing of your pregnancy.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing though\u2026 if he really doesn\u2019t see this as a big issue and you do\u2026 just remember that he will never change and never see anything you do as important.. best of luck raising a child with a man that doesn\u2019t put you first or try to make accommodations during these very important life events.\n\nHope you can both come to a satisfactory outcome for you both.", "NAH. From my experience, births ever so often don't happen at the time intended, so, I would advise to make contingency plans on either side.\n\nIf the birth actually happens on the day of the wedding, man needs a stand-in. If he knows this, he'll be busy finding, scrutinizing and instructing said person beforehand That should give him plenty of time to focus and get out of your hair.\n\nIf it doesn't, all's fine, but he still thoroughly planned and learnt a bit about the importance of the event. \n\nShould the need arise that he's got to saddle the horses and run to you, it's a two.hours drive. That's manageable and again, the detailed plans will help him realize the importance.\n\nI'm guessing he's a bit of a meathead but let's just say you're gonna be able to guide him in the proper direction.", "Honestly, unless there is something that\u2019s not being said, I don\u2019t think you ATA, but neither is your husband. This seems easy to work out. Assume it\u2019s going to work out. If something happens and your husband needs to bail on the wedding last minute, then I\u2019m sure the groom will understand, as long as they know ahead of time.", "NTA. People who can\u2019t get pregnant really do not seem to appreciate the danger, unpredictability, and immediacy of labor. Delivering alone is not something you should have to worry about and is definitely a possibility if he is 2 hours away.", "NAH, but kinda leaning towards YTA if you make him miss the event. \n\nI understand your anxiety. It's very normal and reasonable to be nervous. I've been there, I get it. \n\nIt's one week AFTER your due date. At your age, many doctors don't generally like letting you go over your due date. Some are supportive of it however. But chances are it's likely baby will already be here by the time the wedding comes.\n\nIn the event you do go over your due date, it's only 2 hours away. Set ground rules. Phone must stay on, no drinking, be prepared to leave the venue immediately at any moment. Have him plan with the Groom to have a backup Best Man in case of emergency. \n\nI can empathize because I was in a similar situation. My husband was going to travel several hours away a  week before my due date to go hunting for a few days. Baby ended up coming early the day before he was going to leave, and his trip was cancelled. I went into labor with our second baby right after my husband went to work a job site a couple of hours away and he met me at the hospital. Baby was two weeks early. \n\nLabor normally lasts a few hours. Plenty of time for an emergency exit from the wedding.", "I understand your concerns & they not completely unfounded.  Still, YTA for seemingly not being willing to work out a compromise for your husband to attend to his best friend's wedding.  The wedding is only 2 hours away, so he can always abstain from drinking & jump in the car to drive back if you go into labor or there's an emergency.  And if you do give birth the week before on your due date, & assuming no serious ongoing medical complications or other extenuating circumstances, you should be able to go without him for half a day so he can participate in this once in a lifetime event.  Why not let his mom (or someone else) come help you out for the day while he's gone?  This event is obviously very important to him, so you should do what you can to reasonably accommodate his attendance.", "Slight YTA - Obviously, the birth of your child is more important than the wedding, but the odds are against it coming down to one or the other unless you force the issue. You're likely to have already given birth and will probably be home recovering. Your husband isn't talking about staying over, so what he's really talking about being gone for is the same length of time he'll be at work during a normal day. Are there zero people who can be with you during the day if you feel uncomfortable being alone? \n\nObviously, if you haven't given birth by the wedding date, and you go into labor, he should skip the wedding, but it feels unreasonable (to me) to expect him to miss his best friend's wedding if you've already given birth and are recovering well and there's someone else who can help out.", "NTA. As someone who just gave birth 6 months ago at 37, there is zero chance in hell I'd want my mother in law helping out, and I had her there for the birth! Postpartum SUCKS. I was not prepared. You feel terrible. You are bleeding, in diapers, leaking milk, you STINK terribly, your emotions are everywhere, you are tired like you never thought you could be in your life, I had crazy chills and hot flashes. No. You don't need other people withnessing that if you are not comfortable. And nighttime is way worse than during the day for everything. I am guessing it's an evening wedding. Hell to the fuck no.\n\nETA: as a first time mom, I expected a long labor. But no. It was FAST. So being only two hours away means nothing. What if there is car trouble? Or traffic? Absolutely not. My husband felt bad going to a work party which was two BLOCKS away six weeks after I gave birth.\n\nETA2: Even if he's two hours away when she goes into labor, why should she have to labor alone for two hours? Or with a random family member? And this is all assuming he makes it in two hours and there is zero hold ups.", "Possibly the a\n\nIt's a stressful period, so I understand why you're not comfortable with him being 2 hours away. IMO, it's manageable and you both could be flexible. He could cancel last minute if you start your work before he leaves or come back ASAP as soon as you start. \n\nThere is things you can do to make this manageable and there are contingency plans that can be made. It doesn't have to be a clear cut \"NO\". There is a good chance he can go without any problem.", "YTA - it's close enough that he can be back if you're in any danger, just compromise and say he has to be sober enough to drive.", "NAH. i totally get you being worried. My first came in less than 5 hours from first contraction. By the time I know I was for sure in labor, it was less than 2 hours. My husband would\u2019ve missed the birth if it was the same day, but him being gone 8 hours if you\u2019re home will be okay. Have a mom or friend come by. Ask him to not drink so he can drive home the same night. I think it will be fine. My husband skipped his cousin\u2019s wedding because I was pregnant and sick and it was a plane ride away and I just didn\u2019t want to be alone. He didn\u2019t mind though.

I can see both sides but I'm also from the Midwest where you're looking at a 2 hour round trip to go do ANYTHING, really. So I personally don't see the big deal because 2 hours isn't shit to drive, IMO. But I do see your POV. The way I read it, and maybe how he's taking it - is that this is an absolute, set in stone, he can't go.

He got married the 21st aug and my due date was the 24th. My son didn\u2019t arrive until the 25th and my mum was here so I told him he could go but I\u2019d stay home. He was over 6 hours away by car in the north of England and was on standby to come back as quickly as possible. My first took 12 hours to arrive from first contractions. My second, who arrived 6 weeks ago took 6 hours. \n\nI did have long chats with my husband and as he had to leave the day before, he even made sure I was okay and happy for him to go.

Unless you're in active labor or otherwise in distress, two hours isn't that far away.  But I also agree that your husband needs to talk to the groom and come up with a plan for a best man alternate who can step in at short notice so your child's birth won't throw a wrench into their wedding.

So it seems to me that he's avoiding answering the correct question, which is \"if attending this wedding would keep you from being with me during or immediately after our child is being born, do you intend to attend the wedding?\"\n\nBecause I can't tell from your post what is answer would be. If it's Yes he intends to go to the wedding no matter what, he's the AH, if it's NO, but he intends to attend otherwise, then no one is.", "NAH, I can see both sides. I was in a very similar situation but with the added complication of lockdowns and if my husband caught COVID he wouldn't have been able to come into the hospital at all. I was lucky, however, in that my husband was on the same page as me. You don't want to stop him from doing something he wants to do, you just want him to be on the same page as you. \n\nI think this is a lose-lose situation. If he doesn't go, and you don't go into labour, he'll be resentful. If he does go and you do go into labour or there are complications and he can't get back in time, you'll be resentful. \n\nI think you both need to discuss what boundaries you're both comfortable with. For me, I wouldn't be happy being home alone with a newborn without my husband (and no parent/in-law/friend or distant relative would be a good enough substitute).

I wouldn\u2019t take kindly to someone telling me what to do in that way either. I think your concerns are VERY valid, but maybe it\u2019s just the way the expectation was delivered?

That is the sensible thing to do, and is the most courteous to the bride and groom as well. \n\nI mean, it would be a pain to have to replace someone in the wedding party at the last minute, so giving the bride and groom a heads up is the polite thing to do. They can decide whether they want to replace your husband or have a stand in ready to go. It probably depends on what the men in the wedding party will be wearing, and whether another person can easily fit your husband's tux or whatever. \n\nIn fact, if they wanted to have a stand in ready to go, your husband should leave the clothes with one of the wedding party so that the replacement person could get them without driving for hours to pick them up.", "He should tell his friend that you will be too close to your due date to confidently say he'll be there as best man. \n\nA decent friend will understand.", "NTA Your feelings are perfectly valid.

Frankly I think your husband\u2019s priorities are out of whack. Family should always come first.", "The waiting for labor I disagree.  Even a ftm can have a faster than 12 hrs labor if she stressed. I myself wouldn't consider it if she hadn't had the baby yet.", "Waiting for labour is iffy. So close to the due date you could go into labour at any time. As long as there was no sign of labour and he made accomodations to come back the second you go into labour, then that 2 hour drive back and him being tipsy seems fine to me.

If your husband can't be there for the most painful and traumatic thing you can go through to grow your family, why should he be there for all the happy times too? Me personally, if my husband insisted on missing our child's birth he won't even get to see the baby before he signs divorce papers.

He\u2019s been doing that since I hit the 38 weeks mark, and he\u2019s basically cleared his entire schedule apart from that to be here for me, and I didn\u2019t ask him to do that at all. \n\nI know he wouldn\u2019t even consider going to an event 8 hours away this close to our delivery date.

Right now, it seems he can\u2019t view the importance of an issue with something so far out. Is that typical? \n\nStep one has to be him informing the couple about the situation. They need to know if they are ok with him missing and will use a backup groomsman or want to leave him out of the party. That\u2019s also a decision that doesn\u2019t have to be made yet.

Sometimes babies have that effect on people? Some just... grow up once they are a parent.\n\nSometimes though, what you are seeing is a streak of selfishness that's a bit more imbedded.

The idea that this is even a discussion, that he might risk not being at your side for the birth of your first child - it seems sort of minor but - it isn't really? \n\nThe wedding itself is a minor logistical dilemma, it's his approach to the issue that's problematic IMO.\n\nAnd yes, you are NTA.", "I am fully capable of compromising and agree with your approach.

Every scenario is possible until it isn't.", "Have you had a child? A whole lot can go down in 2hours, sometimes a whole lot of bad.", "From the minute I realized that I was in labor to giving birth - less than 30 minutes.", "Would you want to spend two hours in labor without your husband?", "For some women it only takes 2 hours. I know someone whose first delivery was only 2 hours of labor, and I know someone else whose delivery was too quick to do an epidural. I know that's not the norm but it's a possibility and if he doesn't want to miss the birth of his child, he needs to be prepared for that possibility. Even if labor takes 4 hours, even if it takes 10 hours, that's still 2 hours of labor and possibly having to get herself to the hospital by herself during a high risk pregnancy, and her first delivery. I wouldn't be comfortable with that, I would want my husband there from the start. And what if there's traffic and it takes more than 2 hours? He mentioned sending his mom over so she wouldn't be on her own, but who wants their mother in law helping them through labor? \n\nAlso, in order for him to be ready to drive home at the drop of a hat, he needs to not be drinking... at his best friends wedding where he is the best man. While some might be fine with not drinking at a wedding, he's clearly not going to do that (unless he doesn't drink anyway) if he's not taking the possibility she goes into labor on that day seriously. And that's the whole issue. Not so much that he's planning on going to the wedding, but that he doesn't seem to be taking the birth and all that comes with it seriously or understanding how important it is to her that he's not far away for very long. Because even if she gives birth a few days before as planned, there's a good chance that on the day of the wedding she's not going to be very comfortable on her own with the baby yet for very long. That still means him not spending the night and driving home afterwards and therefore not drinking much. Is that something he's prepared to do? Who knows, because he won't have a serious discussion about it.\n\nShe is telling him the chance that she needs his support on that day is very high and he is dismissively joking about it and ignoring her concerns.\n\nI know a couple who went to a wedding in the mountains about 2-3 hours from where they lived when she was a few weeks from her due date. I guess they thought it was too early for her to go into labor so they went to the wedding and yep - she went into labor early during the reception. They were too far away from home to go to the hospital they had planned to go to, so they had to go to a local hospital with an OB they didn't know, who didn't know her medical history, etc. I don't remember how long her labor was, it's possible she might have made it back to the hospital of their choice had they gone... but the point is, they couldn't rely on that and they knew that, even though they were only 2-3 hours away.\n\nWith something this important, you can't bank on something being unlikely.", "I don't see anything wrong with what you're saying. When my wife was getting close to having our child, I was terrified to go anywhere that would put me more than an hour from being able to get back home.\n\nI do think that your husband needs to inform his friend that there is a real possibility that he may miss the wedding so that a contingency plan can be put in place if he isn't able to be there as the best man.", "Even if baby is not here, he should be home with you.

We had someone in our wedding party who\u2019s SO was due a couple weeks after our wedding. We knew from the beginning of their pregnancy that there was a chance that he would not be able to come for a myriad of reasons and made contingency plans for the possibility. If he had not been able to come because his SO was in labor, having potential complications, or gave birth early, we all knew that the pregnant SO and baby trumped our wedding.", "It just seems like the focus is on him not going, and if that\u2019s where *you\u2019re* focused, then he\u2019s gonna be focused on how to go.\n\nIn my opinion you should ease off on the possibility of not going, but making sure that everyone is aware of the possibilities and what to do if you happen to be in labor. You\u2019re 2 HOURS away not DAYS.", "Are you acknowledging the fact there is a 90% chance he can go?\n\nIt seems to me you are so fixated on making him see he cannot you are not open to him going in the conversations with him.", "I thought this was all happening \u201cone week away\u201d \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f really misread that", "That\u2019s the problem it sounds op\u2019s husband is refusing to even entertain the possibility of having to miss the wedding.

He is insisting on missing the birth by insisting to leave near the due date", "Yes, but that's not my question. Did he know the wedding date when he agreed? I've known couples who gather the wedding party before deciding the date/venue.", "Well, that was a pretty dumb decision on his part. You're NTA, and he won't be either if he acknowledges the possibility of not being able to go to the wedding as legitimate.", "the husband sounds incredibly immature and selfish to even be putting his wife in this situation. the plan should\u2019ve been, decline best man role, tentatively attend as a guest, wait until wedding week to decide.\n\n my partner wouldn\u2019t even think twice about not being there for me, i think ultimately he would let me choose what we do since ya know, i\u2019d be the one creating life inside me & whatnot. i see so many stories of women choosing to have children with subpar partners that don\u2019t prioritize or take responsibility. OP is gonna continue to be the one making sacrifices while her husband gets to prioritize himself.", "the fact that he is even planning on going is crazy to me but hes not even validating her fears around this. its frankly cruel he's putting this on her", "I made a rule with my husband. No jokes like this. I needed to know he understood how big of a deal it was. You can tell him you're uncomfortable and you would like to have a real discussion where he doesn't joke", "Does he always do this about serious topics? Yellow flag for sure, and must be frustrating. If he doesn't normally do this, perhaps him joking and dancing around the subject is the way his anxiety about everything is presenting? Not that its fair to you, but that would be way more understandable.", "Thank you!", "I'm honestly shocked at these comments. \n\nYou're over here birthing an entire baby - you just sacrificed your body, months of sleep (and many more to come), daily discomfort etc. - and you're not even ALLOWED to expect your husband to exist in your vicinity and not go hours away from you?\n\nHave y'all women no expectations of your partners? I cannot believe if my wife were to give birth around a certain time and I was hours away. I would never forgive myself for leaving her alone in those vulnerable moments where she might need me most.

Being almost 41 weeks pregnant hoping the baby doesn't come?\n\nI am very confused here. Are you resentful at being pregnant? Do you think he will be hoping his child won't come in time so he can go to the wedding?

You\u2019ll have many additional appointments that will help you to determine when labor might be.

I\u2019m usually pretty chill but he totally thought I was over reacting. Anyways fast forward to 41 weeks and I go in to be induced, they break my water and I chill out with some mild cramping for an hour or two. Late morning rolls around and the nurse come to check on me and I say I\u2019m having some moderate cramps but not really much in the way of contractions. Nurse offers to get the dr to order pain meds and they would likely need to put me on the drip in an hour or so if I still wasn\u2019t contracting. So I say ok well why don\u2019t you check to see if anything is happening and then the dr can order pain meds and the drip all at the same time as I\u2019m not in agony but if this is going to be a 12 hour affair I might as well be comfortable. Nurse says this is a great idea andddd then all hell broke loose. Apparently my cramps were transitional labour and my baby was pretty much crowning.

Pregnancy and childbirth are very anxiety provoking for most first time parents (and repeats). It is one of the most dangerous things you will ever do, and wanting the support of your _partner_ as the days close in is entirely reasonable. Wanting the reassurance that unequivocally he will choose to be with _you_ and supporting _you_ in the event of late labor, premature birth, complications, etc. is also completely reasonable. \n\nThere are so many unforeseen things that could be going on at that point, and his cavalier attitude of \u201coh, two hours away, big whoop\u201d while actively planning to spend at least a full day away from you during that time, is really concerning about how he treats the responsibility of impending fatherhood and where he places your comfort on his list of priorities (important, but not if it conflicts with something he wants to do). \n\nYour feelings are valid and it\u2019s completely understandable that his casual attitude is triggering your intuition about his view of your role and the baby\u2019s role in his life. He sounds very immature and that is concerning. The fact that he did not recognize and prioritize the potential conflict _himself_ tells me he is very ignorant about late stage pregnancy and the neonatal period. Trying to foist the responsibility off on your mom is one more red flag.", "Honestly so many peoples partners commute for work. Throughout all my pregnancies my husband was working about 1.5 hours from home, you create a plan. Make sure he\u2019s by his phone not drinking.

I know there are lots of reasons that fathers aren't able to be there, but a wedding is a really lame one.", "You can't be this ignorant. Women who end up not being able to make their own medical decisions due to complications during birth, dying, or in a life or death situation in birth often RELY on their partner to advocate for what they'd want, i.e., save themselves or the baby, agree to medical interventions or decline them, and in the cases of infant death be there to emotionally support his wife through that\nThese aren't rare situations either.", "How, specifically, is OP \u2018making it a conflict\u2019?", "Sometimes when feelings are intense, people don't manage to properly express themselves.

Most requests to be in the wedding party that I've seen don't start \"our wedding will be on 10/15/23, will you be my best man?\" They're someone asking their best friend of 25 years to be a part of the wedding, and details come after. You linking to the comment where OP says he knew her due date is, again, fully irrelevant to my question.", "A grocery store isn't 2 hours away, and is for something you need to live. You're also usually going to have your ringer on and not be distracted at the grocery store. OP doesn't need to be trying to reach her husband frantically while in labor. If it happens during the ceremony we can be sure he ain't gonna pick up or check his phone, so 2 hours can easily turn into 2.5 or 3. Childbirth is bloody terrifying and the fact that her husband doesn't give a toss and would be fine to not be there for hours is not good.\n\nAlso, I'm flabbergasted at the amount of people convinced he can make it in 2 hours. Babies don't follow our schedule, they follow theirs. 90 minutes from first contraction to baby is absolutely a thing. Things going WRONG 30 minutes in is a thing. All it takes is an emergency C-Section and now OP has to go through surgery AND childbirth alone, and the person who's meant to be handling the emergency decisions is driving to the hospital instead of handling things. At that stage OP can literally just up and pass out in her home if things go wrong. There is a reason doctors recommend not going that far away if you can at all help it! Yes, yes it's a wait and see but the fact that OPs husband seems to not even notice shit can go wrong and refuses to plan doesn't fill me with confidence.", "do you know what can go wrong in 2 hours though. and that's 2 hours if he leaves right at that exact moment.", "Right. I'm not sure where OP is but my partner's paternity leave didn't kick in until the day of, so if I went into labour when he was at work then I'd be on my own until he could get back.

I should leave, too.", "The US has the highest percentage of maternal deaths of all First-World nations. \ud83d\ude3f", "Anything can happen.  Literally.  BUT... dude is 2 hours away - if there was even a hint of anything happening, he wouldn't go.  But if she was fine that morning - I don't see the issue.", "As usual it seems this thread is full of teenagers who have never experienced the topic at hand. I'm on my second pregnancy. People calling her controlling are delusional. She's nicer than me, that's way too fucking close. My partner helped put this kid in me and I'm the one with the shit end of the deal. The least he can do is be there in the immediate week around my due date/during labor/immediately postpartum.\n\n Have these people ever been postpartum with a newborn? It fucking sucks, you're bleeding everywhere, covered in breast milk, exhausted, and pumped full of hormones. You're vulnerable. You need your PARTNER, not some substitution for them."]}
