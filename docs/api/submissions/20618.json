He lied to me and said that he didn't have kids. Fast foreward 2 years, after we got married, and I find out that he actually has 3 kids (14F and twin 12M). We almost got divorced, but after couples' counseling, we stayed together, on the condition that me and his kids are never in the same house.\n\nSo far, whenever they visited (which was rare, and for a weekend at most), I would just go stay with a friend, or book a hotel. But this time, they will be visiting for 3 weeks.\n\nSo I just booked a vacation for myself to a beach town, and am planning to enjoy my time without having to take care of kids.\n\nMy husband says that it's an AH move, his kids think that I hate them, because I never agree to meet them, and that they were excited to meet me, and to get to know their stepmother.

He made his bed so he can go ahead and get super comfy for the next 3 weeks. Enjoy your vacation, girl!!\n\nEdit: he's not going to drop this so I don't see there being a point continuing this relationship.

Consider divorcing the manipulative liar anyway.", "YTA to yourself for staying with this AH after this lie... but NTA for going on vacation.", "NTA. You were perfectly clear with your expectations going in to the marriage and he chose to lie to you.", "NTA,\n\nIf he's going to pull stunts like this it might be better to just get divorced. After all he did lie to you about the kids, that alone would be enough for me to leave.", "ESH\n\nYou should've left him, he lied to you for 2 years about not having children. Then you made an insane deal, that you'll never meet his children, and you actually expected your manipulative, lying husband to keep to this deal?! Of course he's lying and manipulating you now to meet the children and become a step mother to them. Your whole marriage is a sham and now you're an equal participant to this sham.", "ESH (except the kids) in my opinion. Lying about something like this would have been a deal breaker for me, he's definitely TA for that, but either you're in, or you're out, by not meeting the kids and leaving every time they come, you've put yourself (and them as well) in a strange sort of limbo. \n\nYou won't make the kids disappear by not acknowledging their existence. Are you going to leave every time they come to visit, say, even 20 years later, when they're adults and perhaps have their own kids? I'm sorry your husband lied to you, but your solution of the problem doesn't really seem like a solution, tbh.", "ESH. You should have left him. Lying about having kids until after MARRIAGE is probably one of the shittiest things a person can do, both to the kids and to the spouse. He betrayed your trust in an absolutely insane way. Hiding his kids for that long and marrying someone who made it clear they didn\u2019t want stepkids also means he\u2019s a neglectful father and shitty person. I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting a relationship with his kids but this is so unhealthy and unfair for his children. I would\u2019ve thought that the marriage was unsaveable anyways after that but if you\u2019re going to keep up this vacation thing then you really do need to leave him. \n\nJust to be clear you are only a mild AH because you made your boundaries very clear and I respect that decision but man his kids must feel like absolute shit about this.", "NTA. Not the kids fault either, obviously, but your husband is a true AH.\n\nAs with many others posting here I'm unsure why you're still married to him.", "NTA.  Sounds like this was a dealbreaker for you, he knew it, he lied, he blew it.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is tho. A big one.", "NTA but your husband is and a horrible parent.", "NTA, but you should really get a divorce. I don't know how you can trust someone like that.", "NTA - You we\u2019re honest and he was not. These are the consequences. You are a little extreme, but it\u2019s a sloppy slope from being friendly in passing to being responsible for them during emergencies.", "ESH\n\nHe shouldn't have lied to you, and he shouldn't be setting those kids up to feel abandoned, but you shouldn't have stayed married to him and inflicted such a miserable life on his kids. He has kids, he will always have kids, and if you don't want to be a step parent you need to not be married to someone with kids. \n\nHe shouldn't have to be a bad father in order to stay married to you (though to be clear, it seems pretty obvious he's a bad father either way).\n\nI also want to know what kind of terrible couples counsellor you had that they were pretty much a-ok for him to abandon most of his parental responsibilities in order to save his marriage.", "NTA. Your husband has some nerve. He manipulated and lied to you in order to get you to marry him. You stayed in the marriage on the basis that you\u2019d never meet his children and he\u2019s trying to guilt you into doing that. My guess is that your husband is counting on that he can manipulate you into being their stepmother.", "NTA.  Have a wonderful and relaxing vacation.", "\"yet he chose to force me\" lmao\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGiving the benefit of the doubt that this is actually real and you really are this obtuse. No one is forcing you to stay. The fact that you didn't end the relationship when you found out? Thats on you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe kids are not asking you to be a parent. They literally just want to meet the person that is married to their dad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI sincerely hope this is just fanfic ragebait.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI forgot how disillusioned this sub is lmao", "ESH. \n\nI absolutely get wanting to be out of the house when they are around, you know your boundaries and know you never want to deal with kids again. \n\nBut I don't think you can have it both ways; couples counselling isn't going to fix your fundamental issue, which is that you don't want kids and he does. The arrangement you have doesn't sound sustainable. What are you going to do when the kids are old enough? Just start having a relationship with them? They're never going to allow that. You can't be married to someone and be completely dissociated with their kids.\n\nEven though it's not what you signed up for, the way you treat them in their formative years is going to permanently affect them, and even if it's not your intention, they're going to feel abandoned and disliked, which they are going to hold against you for the rest of their lives. And given that your husband already tricked you once about all this, I wouldn't put it past him to screw you over when the kids eventually ask him to pick sides.", "I'm in between N T A and E S H, but I'm gonna go with NTA. You were lied to, you made a deal with him and he agreed with it. His children are not your responsibility, if this is having a negative impact on them, he is the one responsible. You've stated your boundaries and condition and it's on him to decide what to do with it. He knew what he was getting into and he's the one who caused this situation. It's weird of him to lie till you're married, probably with the expectation that you'll change your mind and then when that didn't work agree with a condition, probably also with the expectation that you change your mind, and then say the condition he agreed to makes you an ah. He agreed on this condition, he shouldn't be surprised when the condition happens then. If he doesn't agree with this condition, he shouldn't have agreed and/or divorced.\n\nThe reason that tipped me to NTA is because you guys went to a counselor, and I am assuming the counselor didn't protest against this condition (which, if the case, is pretty shortsighted of them) and because your husband agreed to the condition + you didn't sign up for being a stepparent and made your intentions clear from the beginning. \n\nEven though you are not the asshole, I don't see this work. Besides that his lifestyle does not align with yours, he lied to you for years until he essentially trapped you with marriage and it seems like he agrees/lies about things with the expectation that you'll probably change your mind later. That, or he just has a really hard time thinking longterm. I wouldn't be able to trust them.\n\nAnd even though the children are not your responsibility, their father doesn't seem to be acting responsible. It still does have a negative impact on them and this needs to be addressed in some way. You could consider communicating with the mother and your husband (but I think the mother might be better, if you're neutral towards each other) about what to do and/or look into divorcing again. As this situation is messy for everyone involved and harmful for you and the children.", "ESH- your husband was incredibly deceitful and dishonest but the fact of the matter is, that he has children. You should have stuck to your guns and divorced him as you will eventually drive a wedge between him and his children. Again that\u2019s his fault not yours, but it must be creating so much tension within both families. You said below that you will be happy to meet them when they are adults, but do you really think they will want to meet you, when you have deliberately avoided them and their very existence for years? Your husband has done a terrible thing here.", "YTA for staying with him. Not for going on vacation. \n\nHiding kids isn't a small lie, it's a red flag. The first 3yrs of your relationship was a lie. Marriage councillor should have told you to get the fuck out. Also, imagine if you were that kid your dad lied about and pretend you didn't exist, you'd be calling him an awful person and an awful dad. God knows the damage his lies have done to them.

Why do you choose to stay with a man who actively lied to you for *years* and who expects you to suck it up and get over it? Those kids will not disappear, any relationship you could have with them in the future is already gone and I doubt they'd be interested to hear you out.\n\nAnd that aside, if he can lie so easily for something as big as *kids*, how can you be so sure he haven't lied about anything else?", "ESH I\u2019m sure OP will be along to say \u201cBut I love him!\u201d Shortly.", "NTA and I would have divorced him. He lied to you and now he's trying to force you to be a step parent after you made it abundantly clear you don't want that? Oh, and trying to guilt you now? Nope. Forget that.", "NTA - he's very much the A H because *he didn't tell you he had kids* which would be a huge betrayal to anyone, but especially to you, given your history. If he wanted you to change, he should have ended things. We always say, \"only stay in relationships if you can see being with this person exactly as they are forever, people don't change\". Well - you haven't changed. You don't have to change. I feel horrible for the kids, but that's on their dad. You don't want to be a mom, and you don't have to be.", "NTA - but man, why do you stay with him?? Lying about something so important seems like a deal-breaker to me. He doesn't respect you or his children, that says a lot about the kind of person he is.\n\nYou agreed to stay married because you wouldn't have to see his children, which doesn't seem healthy but okay, but now he's reneging on that so it might be time to re think what you've discussed during marriage counselling.", "NTA. But why are you still married? How did you not know for two years he has kids? He never visited or have them stay with him? I don\u2019t understand. What a horrible father.", "NTA,  bc you were absolutely clear from the outset about this.  And then your husband lied, for TWO YEARS.  I feel bad for the kids, bc this is not an easy situation for them to understand,  but again- that's your husband's fault, not yours.", "ESH not for the vacation but for this BS agreement. He's a dad and it's not realisitic that you will never be in a room with those kids. He's also very obviously trying to play the long game and wear you down. He lied to you, he tricked you into marriage and he is not upholding the agreement which was only ever a way to stop you from leaving. Get out, move on, find someone who wants the same things you do. You're being an AH to yourself here. You're also enabling a dynamic that is honestly toxic for those kids, they deserve a stepmother who can stand to be in a room with them.", "NTA, you we're upfront abt your boundaries yet he chose to disrespect that and lie to you.", "ESH . He's TA for not being honest. YTA for not agreeing to even MEET the kids if you have decided to stay. Refusing to even meet his children is gross behavior and you should just get a divorce if that's how you feel about it. Ignoring their existence until the end of time isn't appropriate at all. Why can't you just meet them and then still go on your trip? You're giving these kids issues and it's because their dad is a liar and also giving them issues by marrying a person who clearly hates kids. You're both huge assholes.", "OP, that's a pretty significant lie. Why didn't you leave him? He not only betrayed you but his own children. \n\nYou and his kids deserve better. He's not a good husband or father. \n\nNTA", "No amount of couples counselling can fix this lol", "honestly i would say e s h but i\u2019m tired of shit like this. YTA FOR STAYING WITH HIM!!! like have some self respect goddamn! there is absolutely no way that \u201ci can lie about my preteens literal existence for years because the times i see them are so few\u201d guy is the most respectable lovable guy you\u2019ve ever met. no way. and if he is then still keep looking. \n\nmarried men statistically live longer. do you think the world needs 5-10 extra years with this guy? what do you think it says about you that you are enabling him in this way?", "NTA- you were upfront from the beginning, your husband is the liar, and you are making his lies tolerable by leaving him to take care of his own children. He is obviously not that close to them if he kept them from you for so long.", "Nope. NTA. I'm surprised you stayed with him after that tbh. They're not your kids so not your problem", "My ex told me that he was never going to get married and didn\u2019t want kids. I conned myself into believing I never wanted to get married and didn\u2019t want kids when we were together, because I loved him and wanted to spend my life with him. He cheated on me\u2026 with women that had kids! And now lives with a woman who has FOUR children. \n\nI wish I saw the red flags with him earlier and wish that I knew my true self better back then. I wasted 6 (child bearing) years of my life trying to change a cheating man. Ugh, it\u2019s embarrassing to even think of me back then. We went to couples therapy\u2026and the therapist told us to break up. And then privately she told me to leave him and get therapy on my own. I did both and am so much happier.", "ESH", "This is a weird situation, I don't think your situation is sustainable. \nYou don't want anything to do with kids but they're in your life, and you avoid them like the plague? Wouldn't hurt to at least meet them otherwise you're just gonna be a ghost in your own relationship. Spoken of but never seen, sorta thing. Almost like Voldemort lol. \n\nSo what's gonna happen when he needs to prioritize his kids over you? \nIs this really sustainable for you? \n\nObviously NTA, cause you have an agreement and your husband is an idiot. Just be careful and take care.", "NTA but leaning towards everyone\u2019s the AH. He def sucks for lying to you and I totally get going on vacation and all that BUT, he\u2019s not asking you to parent his kids (at least from my understanding of what OP said). He\u2019s just asking you to meet them. \n\nI see it almost like how if you\u2019re with someone you want them to meet your family. From what you\u2019ve told  us he isn\u2019t asking you to be their parent or to parent/support them. I\u2019m sure he just wants you to meet three people who are his life and they want to meet the person that makes their dad happy. I don\u2019t think it would hurt to maybe just meet them??? It can obv be overwhelming but why not start out small and have dinner with them and continue staying at hotels and stuff when they\u2019re there???", "So he didn't see them for 2 years after you got married?", "ESH. Him the mist for lying & you for staying once you found out about the kids. Once you agreed to stay you knew at some point you were going to have to interact with them. If you truly plan on having no contact with them then you need to get a divorce.", "Thisss! If you can LIE about having three children what else is he lying about?", "Yeah OP you're NTA but you seriously need to reconsider your marriage again. Please get divorced OP. Once you start meeting your husband's kids, he will guilt-trip you into playing mommy duties to his kids. \n\nJust think what kind of man you're married to who lied about the same deal-breaker you insisted upon for your childhood trauma over parentification, for his own benefits. Your husband doesn't even spend time with his own kids, lies about their damn existence. What kind of father does this? Your husband is one of the most horrible people I've ever come across/ herad about. He has no love, respect, gratitude in his heart for you OP. If he lies about his own kids, imagine what else he is lying to you about for all these years.\n\nLEAVE OP. YOU DESERVE BETTER.", "Don\u2019t just divorce, get an annulment for fraud . . . NTA", "Yeah, no amount of couples counseling can make that right. You got conned into this marriage in the first place and you got conned into staying in it :/", "Seriously. OP should start doing a lot of investigating about the relationship. For people like OP's husband, lies are like potato chips: they never stop at one. Lying about and hiding children for years and misrepresenting himself for a romantic relationship is some serious anti-social personality type shit. I would not be surprised if there are more lies, secrets, and manipulations going on she doesn't know about.", "No downvote here \n\nNTA but OP - he lied to you about the kids.  He knew your boundaries, broke your trust and is still pushing the boundaries.  Yes, the kids did nothing wrong as they didn't cause this, but why stay with him?  \n\nI am also curious what he has told the kids about you.", "Take my upvote because this is the only answer. \n\nAlso, I think OP should just get divorced. He lied to her about the 1 thing she said she doesn\u2019t want and is trying to force her into it. It\u2019s only going to get worse", "It's not much, but here's my upvote. \n\nNTA OP.", "Normally I would downvote this comment when it comes to step parents treating their stepkids like their own kids but nope I agree with you here. \n\nThe only thing I would add is why is op still in this marriage even after being lied to about so huge that she is very adamant about not wanting.\n\n\nETA: ph and for me ESH but the innocent kiddos. They have nothing to do with the stupidity of the adults around them", "Choked laughing on your second line. I agree with your first comment obviously.", "what downvotes?", "You shouldn\u2019t be downvoted because this is the right answer. \n\nI have kids, but I respect when other people say they don\u2019t want them. And what this guy did is deceitful and downright disgusting. Not only did he lie but he managed to keep his children hidden from her for TWO YEARS, then waited until they were married to spring it on her. That\u2019s some next level master manipulation shit. He thought he could change her mind, it\u2019s back fired, and if he keeps pushing she should divorce him.", "Exactly. Sure at 18 you\u2019re no longer *legally* responsible for them but a good parent is there for life. This needs to end before he tries again to guilt you into meeting them \u2018because they\u2019re looking forward to it\u2019 \n\n\nHe has no respect for boundaries you clearly laid out and he previously agreed to", "The dad is the one who has obviously giving the kids the wrong impression of her future involvement in their lives already. He's the one who needs to admit he lied to them as well, and that she doesn't hate them, he just lied to her at the beginning of the relationship and she never wanted kids or involvement with them, but he was trying to trap her into it.", "He won\u2019t", "NTA\n\nTHIS. He's an Ass with capital A. I cannot imagine being with someone who lied to me. And it wasn't \"little lie\" , like he said he loved my salad and after couple of years admit that he hated it. Still dumbass but I can live with that.\n\nAnd now he has the audacity to call OP an AH? Let him go and be free, my friend. You deserve happiness.\n\nEdit: typo", "He probably wanted someone to do the hard work of child care for him and was hoping OP would soften her stance over time", "Agree that ESH. OP should have gotten out the second the kids were discovered. It's impossible for them to not be affected by OPs current actions whether OP likes it or not. She's becoming as complicit as the dad.", "The second one is preferred", "and also,\n\nwhy would you be with a woman who flat out refuses to ever meet your kids at all. Even say hello just once.\n\nI hope the kids mom is a capable parent at least", "The ages are current. And when they no longer are children (as in require parenting), I would be happy to meet them, if they want to.", "yeah i agree. just acting like they dont exist is no solution", "This is a good point ^^ I was going to say NTA but something felt off about it. \n\nIt's one of those situations that while the adults are working out their squabbles, the damage falls back on the kids. And kids grow into adults, and all of a sudden you have a decades-long conflict with a 30 year old you don't even know as a person.\n\nI definitely don't think that it's a solution at all. The dad made a choice to lie, she ignored her own boundaries and decided to stay, and the kids will end up being the ones hurt most by this ridiculous situation - the people who didn't decide shit. They created this awful situation, together, and now she's stonewalling these teenagers. Like, pick a boundary and stick with it?\n\nI've dated people with kids before. You can't separate parental responsibility and a new relationship unless they are a really, really shitty parent. I don't understand OP thinks this will turn out down the road but I hope they figure it out.\n\nEdit: I also feel like she's using her intentional distance to absolve any guilt by being an absentee step-parent with little to no communication. \"It's not my fault, I've never even been in the same room with them\". Again, as a result of her ignoring her own boundaries and staying with a liar. You got with their dad? That puts you in their lives no matter what?", "And 10 years from now she will be wondering why the adult children don't like her", "Thank you, I was going back and forth in my mind - you just totally nailed it! ESH, OP", "ESH for sure. OP obviously has trauma and is childfree for very good reason - not that you need any reason to be childfree apart from simply not wanting children, but her strong aversion to children makes sense from her own childhood.\n\nThat\u2019s fine but to turn a blind eye to terrible parenting is still awful, regardless of how much he lied. She should have walked away from this as soon as it came out he had kids he\u2019d managed to hide for YEARS. Just how absent and bad a father is he??\n\nHusband is the far bigger asshole but how people are willing to stay with people who are clearly terrible parents is beyond me and condones their actions, and that makes them an asshole too. Childfree or not.\n\nI will never understand people who have shitty childhoods and then choose partners who are bad parents. You ran away from home to escape your bad parents but are then willing to stay with a man who neglects his own children? I guess trauma responses don\u2019t always make sense but it still blows my mind.", "She entered a marriage under false pretenses and owes him and those kids nothing. She was very clear before marriage and this was an conscious and fully informed decision of his.", "I mean, it's obvious he's told them she exists and he must have expected her to be around for these 3 weeks, and told his kids they'd get to meet her. They wouldn't have been disappointed otherwise. They wouldn't be the ones calling her step-mom, unless he is calling her that when talking to them. \n\nHe's manipulating everyone here...", "Lied to her for YEARS until they were MARRIED! Wow. How is that even possible?", "Oh definitely. He needs a scapegoat for his bad decisions.", "You might be happy to, but they won't. \n\nAnd it's not like children turn 18 and magically don't need parental figures anymore. Parenting is a *lifetime* of work, it just means different things at different phases.", "I think it would be too late then. Your husband lied to you, a major lie. What kind of lies does he tell the children about you? I say meet them once, tell them the whole story and debunk any lies their father told ( if any), and then determine the relationship. I don\u2019t think they require parenting at this age ( they mostly stay with their mom) and perhaps they want to know this mysterious woman is all.", "Oh yes, great plan. I'm sure they'll love to meet you after you pretended they didn't exist and shunned them their entire childhoods. Lmao. Jesus Christ.", "But why would they want to? They have done nothing wrong except have a liar as a father. If this was such a big deal to you (and I can completely understand why, your parents are arseholes), you should have walked away as soon as you found out about the kids. My daughter's dad is a compulsive liar\n He lied about having prostate cancer. You usually find liars who tell big lies like this lie about stupid stuff as well. How can you believe a word he says?", "The husband is 100% a lying asshole, no doubt about it. I don't even understand how you can get so deep into a relationship to the point where you can keep your children a secret until you're married without being a shitty father. \n\nBut she is choosing to stay married to a lying arsehole and putting down a boundary that has implications on teenagers who didn't have any say in the matter. If she doesn't want a relationship with a man with kids, she shouldn't have a relationship with a man with kids. Divorce is a thing. This guy is clearly a shitty dad if he was able to keep 3 children a secret for goodness knows how long, but it's not going to be any better for the children if they think their step-mom hates them and if they're spending 3 weeks in a house where they feel like they've pushed someone out of her own home simply by existing.", "Exactly. The only person causing those kids stress is their father. He was free to lie her out of existence just like he did about them. He knew she would never consent to a relationship with him if he introduced her to his kids, yet chose to tell his kids about her despite knowing that she firmly does not want to ever interact with them whatsoever. He shouldn't have lied to her. But having done so, it's bullshit that he's pretending that the consequences of his choices are her responsibility. It's time to divorce this loser. Twice they've affirmed the conditions of the relationship, and he's still violating those conditions. Now the kids are being harmed too. Relationship over, for everyone's sake.", "Screw divorce, this is annulment material", "NTA- OP your husband is an EPIC AH! He attempted to trap you as a step mom. He\u2019s just tried to do it again. The absolute entitlement of this man having his kids over for 3 weeks without talking you when you have this agreement. The kids should know that their own father is the reason for your absence not you. I\u2019m so sorry.", "Kind of says everything about him as a husband and father doesn't it. The kids are sad because OP doesn't want to meet them, doubt dear dad told them the truth..", "They are 14 and 12. of course they require parenting. Maybe not the physical kind, where you have ti protect them from harm and making messes but teenagers still need emotional parenting and guidance.", "She isn't obliged to raise his kids", "I agree with you. They shouldn't of even tried, she should of just divorced him when she found out. I don't agree on the other hand that she should hold any guilt or blame for how the kids are feeling. All of this is 100% on the dad and she was just trying to make something work and now she knows it's not going to work", "One hundred percent agree. The people who are really suffering here are the kids.", "The only reason I can think that he told the kids was pictures around the house, presence of a ring on his finger and her belongings in the house. I understand it being difficult to explain the kids without saying \"she didn't want to be a mum and I lied about yall existing\" ... I even understand that he may of thought they were gone from his life due to the other parent (I know this can be the case sometimes) .. I understand how she may of forgiven it the first time and come to this agreement BUT him insinuating to the kids that they'll be meeting her and having that time with her, then getting annoyed with her that she didn't follow through with HIS plans. Calling her an AH for sticking to their agreement when this was his mess from day 1! His audacity blows my mind", "Didn't say she was. But pretty poor planning if she's happy to meet them one day lmao cuz they ain't going to be having that shit.", "I get your stance, and I do have sympathy for her. By the time she found out she clearly loved him, and was committed to him, and would have wanted to do anything to make it work. But pretending 3 whole people don't exist just to make your life narrative work for you is neither a healthy or logical way to approach it. I'm honestly surprised the couple's counsellor went along with it, and the husband is even more of an asshole for choosing his wife over his children, but I still think she has to take some responsibility for the choices she's made.", "That's on her husband. She made herself crustal clear, she isn't evil for not wanting a life involving kids. He deceived her MASSIVELY. With their ages she would be better explaining the truth and possibly offering friendship but not parenting.", "The counselor was in it for the pay cheque lol. This was going to be a long standing issue so there's chance of more return $$.\nThe info I need is who chose couples counseling and did anyone want an off the bat divorce? Because my money is on him wanting the counseling and she said this is the only way it would work but it's not ideal and he said \"I'll do it\" hoping she will come around."]}
