We have a golden retriever who just turned 7. Since my middle daughter was 2 years old, I have a feeling that she is allergic to the dog. The bags underneath her eyes were always a little swollen. Some days are worse than others. It's not to the point that it is bothering her but still noticeiable. It also seems to flared up more when she's playing with the dog. I told my husband that maybe she's allergic to something (like the dog) and we should get her tested. On one of her wellness checkup, I told the doctor I am interested in getting my daughter tested for allergies. She said they will need a blood sample to have that done so if I am interested, they will schedule it. When I got home and told my husband this, he didn't like the idea that they have to draw her blood. He thinks we are putting her through the pain for no reason. He also made a comment like even if she's allergic to the dog, are we really going to get rid of him? I was a little frustrated but eventually just let it go. Fast forward to today. Our littliest girl is 1 1/2. She has constant running nose and watery eyes and it's been like this for months.  Again, I suspect she is allergic to something. I took her to get an allergy test without telling my husband. When the results came back, it confirmed that she is indeed allergic to the dog. With the results, I went to my husband. Of course, we got into a huge argument. First, because I did it behind his back which I can understand his anger. But I knew what his response would've been if I had asked him. And then secondly, he refused to rehome the dog. He said her symptons are not that bad and it will get better. He also says  he is allergic to cats but still grew up with them in the house and he is fine. I was so upset so I told him he needs to choose the dog or our girls. I don't think it's fair to put my girls through this when it could be fixed.

It is very exhausting to live with constant allergic reaction to something, and you are choosing between suffering once via rehoming the dog, or prolonging it and possibly affecting your girls health in a negative way via trying different meds (usually they are not meant for constant use, and can also give some unpleasant side effect). \nIf you still want to try, let me share what works for us. I am allergic to cats, and I have two, because I love them. I do not have any carpets which could collect fur. I hoover every day (iRobot), and do wet cleaning (floors, dust) twice a week. I also keep area totally decluttered. Plus Dyson air cleaner with HEPA filters. Cats are allowed in the living room (huge, they have plenty of space and toys), bathroom with their sandbox and kitchen. All other rooms are cat-free zones. I wash hands after petting them, and I make sure not to touch my eyes/nose before hand washing - not to provoke teary/sneezy reactions. I do not take meds, because of side effects. That is all rather time consuming, but I live symptom-free 95% of time. \nBut that\u2019s me, and I am dealing with my own health.

I can\u2019t sit next to anyone that is smoking, because while it didn\u2019t bother me until I was a teen, even one person smoking near me now causes my asthma to flare up.\n\nYour husband is choosing to put himself first.

I can tell you that will their allergies, if they get the common cold virus or the virus who shall not be named, they will suffer worse than others.  Their symptoms could end up leading to asthma because the allergy symptoms affect the lungs.\n\nDo you want your kids to have emphysema when they are 60 because your AH husband prioritized his dog over his children\u2019s health??\n\nIt ok if an adult chooses to have allergic reactions because they love their pet too much to give up the pet.  A consenting adult has every right to live their life as they see fit.  These are tender age children with developing bodies and immune systems.  The allergens have long term effects on children because they are still developing that they don\u2019t on adults and by the time they are adults, it\u2019s too late to reverse the damage.", "NTA your children have been sick and congested for months, the fact that your husband was fine with them staying miserable and didn\u2019t even want to get a test is concerning. There may be solutions where you can keep the dogs without continuing to aggravate their allergies, but there might not be. It doesn\u2019t sound like your husband is even willing to consider prioritizing his kids over the dog. \n\nI think you guys would be assholes for forcing your kids to suffer through allergy symptoms every day. There\u2019s no guarantee that the allergies will get better, and it sounds pretty rough for your kids right now.

(They get vaccinated, after all.) So, I'm calling shenanigans on your husband's claim that this is somehow too intrusive.

Especially with how little your girls are, their hands are all over the floor and everything at pet level. They aren\u2019t old enough to think to wash their hands before they rub their eyes when they tired. When I visited family with pets, I typically was relegated to one room they had made as pet free as they could and was drowsy 90% of the time from antihistamine. For visits this was fine, but it would have made me really sad if it was my everyday. \n\nIs it sad, of course. No one is saying it\u2019s fair to the dog, or that anyone wants this to be the situation. But the fact is your young children are allergic to this dog, to a noticeable degree- and they are too young to be able to have solutions like an adult.

My cat allergies are nowhere near as severe as my allergies for dogs. I take allergy shots and daily medication and it helps against dust, pollen and cats but does nothing for dogs. Allergy shots also aren't an option for everyone. My dad developed severe rashes after he hit maintenance period in his shots. Exposure therapy also does not always work and some allergies worsen over time because of exposure (not all, and not in everyone).\n\nLiving with an allergy trigger is possible but depending on severity is not something trivial you can slack on. I have a robot vacuum go every day. I have to wash my hands after every interaction with my cats. If I hold my cat and fur gets on my clothes, those go in the laundry immediately. I can't lay down or sit in any chairs outside of my room (which is barricaded and has screen to block fur I have to walk through) without putting those clothes in the laundry immediately. If I've interacted with the cats for > 1 hour I have to go isolate myself in my room for a couple of hours after to stop runny noses and breathing troubles. These are just a couple of things someone might have to deal with. I chose to live like this with cats, your daughter does not have that choice.\n\nYou might get lucky and allergy shots + daily medication might suffice to quell all the symptoms, but there is a real risk this might not be the case.

Why wouldn\u2019t a parent want to know about their kids\u2019 health concerns?? \n\nI am very allergic to dogs and cats. Changing parts of my daily life in small ways helped significantly when I had a cat: HEPA air purifier in every room, removing all carpets and rugs so there\u2019s nowhere for dander to get stuck in, getting removable washable couch covers or vacuuming the couch and chairs on a regular basis, vacuuming the floor every couple of days, and dusting every week helped tremendously. If you haven\u2019t already tried these things, then maybe you should. If you didn\u2019t have a dog and the girls were allergic to dust mites, mold, etc., you\u2019d make sure to do the above, right? \n\nAs to the question of allergy shots or meds, I am not against it for young kids, but I can understand why many parents don\u2019t do it. If you\u2019re concerned about the kids being drowsy, give them half-doses at first (*with their pediatrician\u2019s approval*, of course) an hour before bedtime. If they\u2019re going to experience drowsiness, let it happen when they\u2019re about to go to bed anyway. And not all allergy meds induce sleepiness; cetirizine, for example, is less likely to cause drowsiness. I take it every day myself and for the first time in forever, I\u2019ve experienced far fewer allergic reactions to all the dogs that various friends and family have adopted, I frequently cat sit for some friends, and the seasonal allergies are all but gone. Allergy meds are certainly not the end all be all, but sometimes it really is as simple as taking a spoonful or pill. \n\nNTA but you and your husband really need to talk to the pediatrician to find the safest solutions for the kids that doesn\u2019t immediately involve rehoming the dog.", "NTA If taking nondrowsy allergy meds fixes the problem then maybe that\u2019s the way to go.

It's expensive but groomers are better at getting rid of dandruff and shed then diy not to mention it keeps the freed fur from floating around your home. If your dog is allowed on the furniture (or your children like sitting on the dog bed) make sure to regularly wash them, I'd suggest getting a couch cover/blanket to make washing easier.

You can also try to clean your children's hands and faces after they play with the dog to help, tho I know that's not exactly the most feasible thing with little kids.

We have a golden retriever who just turned 7. Since my middle daughter was 2 years old, I have a feeling that she is allergic to the dog. The bags underneath her eyes were always a little swollen. Some days are worse than others. It's not to the point that it is bothering her but still noticeiable. It also seems to flared up more when she's playing with the dog. I told my husband that maybe she's allergic to something (like the dog) and we should get her tested. On one of her wellness checkup, I told the doctor I am interested in getting my daughter tested for allergies. She said they will need a blood sample to have that done so if I am interested, they will schedule it. When I got home and told my husband this, he didn't like the idea that they have to draw her blood. He thinks we are putting her through the pain for no reason. He also made a comment like even if she's allergic to the dog, are we really going to get rid of him? I was a little frustrated but eventually just let it go. Fast forward to today. Our littliest girl is 1 1/2. She has constant running nose and watery eyes and it's been like this for months.  Again, I suspect she is allergic to something. I took her to get an allergy test without telling my husband. When the results came back, it confirmed that she is indeed allergic to the dog. With the results, I went to my husband. Of course, we got into a huge argument. First, because I did it behind his back which I can understand his anger. But I knew what his response would've been if I had asked him. And then secondly, he refused to rehome the dog. He said her symptons are not that bad and it will get better. He also says  he is allergic to cats but still grew up with them in the house and he is fine. I was so upset so I told him he needs to choose the dog or our girls. I don't think it's fair to put my girls through this when it could be fixed. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This is a tough situation because I do believe having a pet is a lifelong commitment, and animals aren\u2019t disposable.

Even with \"tubes\" put in his ears, he still was constantly troubled by fluid in his eustachian tubes. Finally, I rehomed the dog with my in-laws (the dog and ILs knew and loved each other).
