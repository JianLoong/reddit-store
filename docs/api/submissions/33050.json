It was the airlines DUTY (not just \"the could do it\", they MUST) to protect all the other passengers from a person who became a 'walking dead' kind of danger onboard. And they did not. More than that, they harassed a passenger who told them to do their job and protect him.

I\u2019m moving to first class or he\u2019s going somewhere else\u2026.\n\nPlus, the only reason I don\u2019t believe this story is because typically when you\u2019re in the air if they have open seats they\u2019re really not going to fight you too hard if you want to sit there .. especially when they have everybody on board already. I\u2019ve been moved to first class several times just because I noticed empty seats\u2026 in a situation like this, I don\u2019t understand why she tried to fight you on it.

But stopping them from getting back into their seat until you get moved up to first class no. \n\nA better way to handle it would have been to stand up let them take their seat then approach the flight attendant and say sorry, but this guy has now gotten shit on my seat is there any chance I can be moved elsewhere on the plane.
