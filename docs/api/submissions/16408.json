I completely disagree with your stepdad and mother, and frankly, I think they should be more grateful. 6 kids is a lot!! Do you get paid well for this?", "good grief. YOU didn't make her sulk. she did that all on her own. and your parents are being ridiculous. you provided the kids with a perfectly good meal. stepsister was just having a hissy fit.\n\nand this just kills me:\n\n>but I should have made what she liked so she would stop whining because now they have to deal with it too.\n\n*OH NO* they have to actually parent their own children. how awful for them. you have been so roped into being the parent that you actually start off by saying 'there\u2019s only 6 of them' SIX. **SIX** that's alot of kids to be responsible for. especially for a 16 year old. my god. you've said they pay you well (I WOULD HOPE SO!!) but what happens if you don't feel like being a 16 year old mother of 6? do you get to say no? NTA NTA NTA", "From now, when these AH parents go on date night, they can take this whiney child with them.", "Not even starve. One missed dinner will not harm a healthy child. Eat or be mildly inconvenienced until breakfast.", "And in always giving in, they create more whining because she learned that this is the way to get what I want. IMO 2 meal choices she usually eats are more than enough.", "Same. I have 3 kids, and if one of them didn't want to eat a meal that I know they like, there would be no second options or sandwiches. NTA", "Yeah, the trained professionals I know all cap at 10 kids per person, and they are appropriately paid for their work. OP is 16, only 5 years older than the oldest she was looking after and most definitely not trained, she did well under the circumstances. \n\nAlso cooking for that many people is a task!", "For real, if i\u2019m cooking for 6 people they do not get substitutions, I could barely provide napkins.", "Right!? Like if anything $300 is just the bare minimum, I wouldnt do it for less than $10 per kid per hour and $15 for kids that aint potty trained. And I would never babysit 6 kids at one time ever", "I think it really depends. Granted, I did not have 6 siblings, I had 3, but babysitting them when I was 16 was really just being aware and making sure they weren\u2019t doing something that could be harmful. Age range matters, too. At 16, my siblings were 13, 11, and 4, so most attention went to the youngest and keeping him entertained. \n\nI also didn\u2019t get paid, this was 20 years ago, and my parents left me to babysit maybe 2 or 3 times a year\u2026 but paying market rate for watching cartoons and making sure they had something to eat? That\u2019s extreme IMO.", "Your patience and politeness as you educate are inspiring.", "you don't mind because there's ONLY 6 of them?! \ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\ude2e\n\ndear lord, I wouldn't touch that mess with a 10 foot pole. \n\nand sweetie, you're NTA - they are the parents, they have to deal with the mess, not you", "Yes, appeasing kids when they whine is always helpful (/s). You offered her a sandwich, which is plenty of choice. If she was hungry enough, she would have eaten. NTA", "We have a proverb here that 7 people don't wait for 1. It is completely unreasonable to make a special food for a kid when you have 8 others to take care of. She could have eaten if she were hungry. NTA", "NTA - get a job and let someone else deal with that craptastic parenting. That\u2019s a brilliant reason to be saving for college right now", "You made her two different dishes. She refused. NTA. But to take care of 6 kids is a lot!!!", "I would have sent her to bed without dinner (but later take her the sandwich). Those parents did wrong. Gonna be a spoilt brat later on. Nta", "NTA. When a kid behaves like that and throws a tantrum the last thing you do is cave. It sets a precedent that they can act out and they'll be rewarded. She literally tried to do that with you because now it seems surprise surprise, stepdad does it to avoid the headache of a screaming child.", "NTA but it\u2019s clear where 7f gets this behaviour from. \n\nBoth parents seem to think it\u2019s ok to make her a special extra meal \u201cso they don\u2019t have to deal with her whining\u201d. \n\nThat\u2019s a parenting choice. \n\nIt generally creates spoiled brats who whine more, because they learn it works. \n\nI\u2019m interested to know if she is the only one of the 7 of you who gets this special treatment. \n\nIf so, is it because she has a relevant diagnosis (eg autism with sensory processing issues)?\n\nOr is there another reason she gets spoiled - eg maybe because she\u2019s the only \u201ccute\u201d female in the mix - are the siblings mostly male?", "NTA your parents want to train your stepsister into manipulating people with her tantrums.", "And with OP at 16 they can't afford to. In 2 years OP will be able to move out if this kind of behavior escalates and they'll have lost a dependable sitter.", "Exactly. I hate it when the word \"starving\" is used lightly...if you have been around children who are actually starving you would be also.", "I wonder if Step Dad always gives in and Mom just goes along with him to keep the peace.", "Absolutely, then you have several kids acting this way. No thank you!", "I think the \"legal\" number of kids per adult in my country is like 6-8 and that's for professionals..", "The rules at daycares where I live are 1 adult per 4 babies under 18m, 1 adult per 6 toddlers 18m-3y, 1 adult per 8 preschoolers 3y-5y, and something like 1 adult per 12 school aged child under 12. And if it a mixed group, you assign the ratio of the age of the youngest child. So that means if you have a bunch of 10y children and one infant, you need 1 adult per 4 children.", "Oh yeah, I\u2019m talking kids over 5, the younger they are the lower number of kids to one adult due to the higher care needs. One adult would not be able to properly care for 10 babies or toddlers"]}
