Sometimes, I have to babysit and I don\u2019t really mind because there\u2019s only 6 of them and I get paid well, today was one of those days. \n\nMy mom & stepdad went out on a date night, I had to babysit from 5pm-11pm. That meant cooking supper for them. My mom had told me to make spaghetti and garlic bread because it\u2019s fast and they all like it, so I did. But when I served it to the kids, \u201cTia\u201d 7f decided she didn\u2019t like it. She is always a picky eater but spaghetti was one of her favourites so I assumed she was just in one of her moods to be difficult. I told her to try seven bites, it usually works, but she didn\u2019t. She screamed that she wanted pizza but I told her no. Tia kept whining, so I offered to make her a sandwich instead but she insisted on pizza. (The other kids were eating it fine and when I tasted it later it tasted like usual, so it\u2019s not my cooking skills she didn\u2019t like because she\u2019s had my spaghetti before.) \n\nShe kept being moody and refusing to eat the spaghetti, not answering me when I asked her why, and she sat there crying after everyone finished. I made her a sandwich I knew she liked so she wouldn\u2019t starve, but she pushed it away and kept demanding pizza. I told her I wasn\u2019t going to make an entire pizza from scratch and she had to eat either spaghetti or sandwich, she just kept whining. \n\nShe was still moody when my parents got home (we have no school tomorrow so we\u2019re allowed to stay up as long as we like) and told them why. My stepdad said I should have just humoured her and gotten her to eat faster, she would have eaten a \u2018mini pizza\u2019 on bread if it came to that, but I should have made what she liked so she would stop whining because now they have to deal with it too. I told him I didn\u2019t know she wanted a mini pizza but he told me I saw her eating them all the time and should have known. My mom took his side and said I should be more mindful and all this chaos could have been avoided.

You made the meal your mother told you to, and you even offered her a sandwich. She is old enough to understand no. Your parents don't get to blame you and complain that \"now they have to deal with it too\" - they are the parents and they should be dealing with it but not by blaming you!\n\nBy the way, 6 kids to babysit is a LOT and I hope you're getting paid accordingly. Look up typical hourly pay for this where you live.", "NTA: your parents are.  You gave your step-sis two options that she normally enjoys.  Nothing else to be done.  Eat or starve.", "NTA at all. You made your sister two meals that she ordinarily likes and she refused to eat them - that's not your fault. I actually think you went above and beyond in making her that sandwich.\n\nYour mom and step-dad should have backed you all the way and told your sister off for being so difficult. They are just reinforcing the idea that she can, on a whim, decide she doesn't want to eat something and make a fuss until she gets her own way. Sorry, but that's pretty poor parenting.", "NTA. I would not have made one of my own kids a second meal. You are not a short order cook.  You made dinner and she won\u2019t starve because she skipped a single meal.", "NTA.\n\nAt 7 years old,  you're parents are enabling tantrums instead of teaching the kid that its wrong to throw them.", "NTA... your parents are", "Nta. You arent a short order cook. There's no need to cater to a spoiled brat. She was given 2 options. She refused. Missing 1 meal will not cause any health or emotional problems. With 6 kids to watch the last thing you need is  each of them deciding they are entitled to a special.made order because it worked for the brat. Tia needs to eat what is served or don't eat. Stand your ground. If mom and stepdad wanna make 6 separate meals after returning from date nite thats up to them but if they want you to babysit the  they need to support you in this and not micromanage how you \"should\" have done it. Tia wasn't starving and if she was truly hungry we can revert back to the 2 options you offered.", "NTA\n\nYour parents are the biggest AHs here for not telling your step-sister to eat the dinner they instructed you to make.\n\nRefuse to babysit next time because you don\u2019t want a repeat and see how quickly they change their tune. (But also, you probably don\u2019t feel like you can do this.)\n\nI repeat, NTA NTA NTA. And by backing her, they\u2019ve just ensured she\u2019ll tantrum every time you agree to babysit and expect to get her way.\n\nYour parents being upset \u201cbecause now they have to deal with it too\u201d. Oh no, your parents have to deal with the consequences of being parents? GASP! THE HORROR! This is where they went from AHs to Supreme King and Queen of the AH Awards.", "NTA. You offered her two perfectly good options. She\u2019s old enough to where this behavior is not age appropriate. If she were 2, yeah make her a mini pizza. But she\u2019s 7 and I\u2019m pretty sure she could make one herself.", "NTA My little sister is exactly like Tia. Little kids just suck and your parents were being unreasonable. NTA", "I\u2019d say NtA it might avoid the chaos as they call it but it\u2019s rewarding bad behavior. She\u2019ll know that if she pouts and whines long enough, she\u2019ll get what she wants. I get she\u2019s only 7 but enabling her will only make it worse on the long run, especially because she had no legitimate reason to not eat either of the choices offered.", "NTA! Everyone else are though!", "NTA, when I was a kid, I was always given two choices at meal time. I could either eat what was served, or I could go hungry. Guess which one I picked. At 7 you are old enough to learn this little fact of life.", "NTA. Growing up what my mom said was for dinner, that is what we ate, but my brother and I weren\u2019t picky eaters either. Although you\u2019re old enough to watch and care for your siblings, you aren\u2019t expected to know everything about them, especially when it comes to this situation. Also I question why the 7 year old couldn\u2019t just use her words and explain what kind of pizza she wanted instead of you just expecting to know the type her father makes when she wants one. You did your best OP by coming up with alternatives and you didn\u2019t try to purposely starve her.", "NTA. You're not a mind-reader!", "NTA. You\u2019re not her mother. You made her food, she wanted to be a brat. She can eat what\u2019s there or not eat at all. That\u2019s not your issue", "NTA, you're a child being parentified, and even if you're getting paid what you consider \"well\", it's not right. 6 kids? Hell no. I hope you get paid 300+ a night at least.", "NTA\n\nThe thing about feeding kids, is that they\u2019ll eat what\u2019s put in front of them eventually if they get hungry enough. Parents just won\u2019t be patient enough.", "NTA.  You were the babysitter not a short order cook.  You do it for one, next time it\u2019s two.  Ask your parents if either one of them had been alone with them, would they be willing to make several different meals?", "NTA at all.  You're parents are being very unreasonable. Them babying her at 7 years old is turning her into a spoiled brat.  They'll regret that soon after you reach college age and move out and they loose they're built in babysitter.", "NTA - they're mad because they wanted you to deal with her temper tantrum, instead of them. Refuse to babysit again.", "I\u2019d be pissed if I had to watch a step kid . \n\nNTA", "NTA your parents are the reason she throws tantrums if they have taught her that it gets her what she wants. You did a great job being firm and they should learn from you.", "YTA\u2026 just kidding, parents just don\u2019t want to deal with kids so they enable this nonsense because making a pizza isn\u2019t nearly as annoying as Tia\u2019s tantrums. Next time they leave you in charge make sure Tia has bagel bites in the freezer.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If there is a strong aversion to broccoli you could serve cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, spinach, sweet potatoes, carrots etc.\n\nIf your kids won\u2019t eat ANYTHING because they have sensory aversions, then they would need medical intervention because they would starve, like an nutritious IV drip."]}
