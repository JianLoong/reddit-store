No bachelorette? No rehearsal dinner? No bridal party getting ready together?", "Yeah YTA. You easily could have talked to Elsa AT the wedding. It\u2019s easy for anyone to assume that unless you hear it directly from the bride or groom, do NOT do anything like that. And honestly, you should have refused. I wouldn\u2019t call you a full ah, but damn you really were thoughtless.", "It's a soft YTA. In no universe would anyone want someone else to take attention away from them at their own wedding, so it should've been a major red flag to begin with. But even if you genuinely believed that that interaction had occurred and that your sister wanted you to tell people, how (and why) on earth did you go through the entire day leading up to that point without ever once going to your sister and having the \"when would be a good time/should we do it together/etc\" conversation so that you wouldn't do what you did and just randomly stand up at the reception and say \"hey, everyone, this event is about me now\"?  \n\n\nYour other sister is definitely incredibly out of line for doing what she did and no one's going to argue against that, but you not having enough respect and courtesy to figure that out with your sister directly at her own wedding is kinda what makes you an AH in this situation.", "Idk whether to call you an AH or just naive? \n\nIdk about the dynamics of all of your relationships with each other but it seems like you would normally have reason to believe your sisters don\u2019t get along all the time. Your middle sister is definitely an AH but you would have been much wiser to take the initiative to consult with your eldest sister directly before the wedding.

Anna never mentioned when you wanted me to make the announcement, so when should I do it?\"\n\nEven if you truly believed Anna, you had an obligation to arrange the timing with Elsa, and confirm it with her. The fact that you didn't earns you a YTA\n\n\nEdit: To respond to your update, if you were unable to get her attention *on her wedding day* about something you believed she wanted you to do *as part of her wedding celebration*, that means you didn't know when she wanted you to do it.

Congratulations on the baby!", "Yeah, little bit TA.\n\nAs you say yourself, there is an etiquette  and maybe you should have spoken to your sister yourself.", "YTA. Never use secondhand information for things of this magnitude. Always verify at the source.

Hopefully you have learned a few lessons from this mess.", "ESH. Anna, obviously for trying to ruin the wedding and using you.\n\nBut I don't think you get a pass for being \"naive\" in this situation, especially since you were aware of basic wedding etiquette.

Still sent a text or email to Elsa because she still would've gotten the messages immediately after she came back from her trip. Also, it's entirely possible that she could still have spotty cell service and still get messages \n2. Checked with the bride and groom in the day itself.
