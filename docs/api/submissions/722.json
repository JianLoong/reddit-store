You trust people close to you for a reason.", "I *gave* OP that benefit of the doubt: I agree that it seems insane to suspect that someone would be sufficiently vindictive to do this as a prank\n\nMy point is that, even if OP believed that Elsa genuinely wanted her to make the announcement, she hadn't figured out *when* Elsa wanted her to make the announcement. I've been at a wedding where an engagement announcement was made... You know how it was clear to all of us that the bride was on board? The *bride* picked up the mic and said, \"Thank you all for making my day so special! And now, before we cut the cake, my brother has some news about the next party you'll all be invited to...\" and she proceeded to hand the mic to her brother\n\nSo even if we assume that Elsa wanted OP to make the announcement, OP didn't get a cue from her that it was time for her to speak...
