Tech Skilling conferences are different from other conferences. There are no spouse events. It's business from 7am - 9pm+. People only talk tech - we are all there to geek out. Unless you're very extroverted you'll probably need a recovery evening (or multiple) where you don't have to talk to anyone. You need down time to process what you learned and have a fresh mind for the next day. Attending conferences well is a skill you have to build. Go to the first one alone, see what it's like, and then bring her next time if you feel comfortable. But not the first one. What if you meet someone cool in a session and want to go to dinner with them spontaneously at the last minute? But you can't because you promised your wife you'd meet up. Even if you discuss expectations it's not worth the risk.\n\nSource: I've been a speaker at 100+ large tech conferences over the past 15 years.

Professional conferences can make or break a career. You need to be fully invested in networking and furthering your skills. Look at it this way - your company is paying your salary PLUS whatever costs of the event and travel are. They want their money\u2019s worth. Now, some spouses are great at being in their own and enjoying the location then fading into support roles in the evening.

It was fun, but I wasn't nearly as focused on the work aspect as the other 2 conferences (by a long shot). As much as it feels like a \"trip,\" it's work and having that free time after the meetings means you can network and bond with colleagues, which is a valuable part of the experience. I can understand where your wife is coming from, because FREE HOTEL, but NTA.\n\nETA: My SO is also wonderfully self-sufficient and put ZERO pressure on me to spend time with him and I STILL struggled to focus. I wanted to go play with my honey! We did extend the trip by a few days and had a ball--I recommend doing that (although sorting out reimbursement and employer-paid expenses after the trip was rough!).", "Check the conference website. Many of the conferences I attended over the years had planned touristy activities for the spouse. My wife came with me many times and we worked out how to separate the work and the pleasure aspects. Often she was an asset in making connections and networking. The suggestion to stay a few days extra and have your wife join you is also a good idea.", "NTA this is a WORK thing its not a party she would probably be bored and distract you if she went warm climate or not.", "A SOFT YTA. My husband and I went on a work trip over seas. Well my husband went on a work trip and I tagged along. It was an AMAZING trip!!! He worked all day and I went out and got to explore and enjoy my vacation. We slept in the same bed. Got up in the morning, talked over his schedule and what my plans were and then\u2026we were off. I got to experience so many wonderful things while he worked and the best part\u2026I didn\u2019t have to feel guilty. I didn\u2019t have to worry about making him happy and he didn\u2019t have to worry about making me happy. On a few nights I went to dinner with the company (ONLY WHEN THEY INVITED ME). It was magical. As long as she leaves you alone to work and do your thing and you let her be it\u2019s basically just a free hotel room for her.", "NTA it's a work function not a vacation, sounds like the wife is very controlling and has no concept of a healthy marriage or boundaries. I would never ask my husband to take me on a out of state WORK trip, that's completely ridiculous", "Nta. This isn't a working vacation.it's an actual work conference, and she needs to respect that. It would be different if you had significant downtime or if there were social dinners on a boat or something, but in this case what you're saying makes complete sense.\n\nYour working from 8am til 6pm.

Tell her none of the other workers are bringing spouses and that this is a work trip and that you are not bringing her. \n\nSometimes \"no\" is a complete sentence.", "NAH - I feel for both of you, because you both have incredibly valid points. It's sad that no compromise is happening, this could be an issue in the future.", "What\u2019s your nationality and what\u2019s your company\u2019s culture like? We could be seeing a cross cultural issue here and different expectations  of work while on a company trip.", "I will say NTA because it is reasonable to ask her not to go, but I would like to offer a potential perspective that may not have been considered based on slight personal experience. My dad (before his passing) ran a continuing education conference that I helped out with. Granted it wasn\u2019t for a job like yours but for people in a volunteer situation, but it was still an all day (9-4ish) for 2 days plus a 1/2 day to round out the weekend. Spouses were welcomed in our case, although the main participants were the only ones possibly comped by the organization that they volunteered for so the spouse had to be paid for out of pocket. Otherwise, the spouses that came with would just go enjoy themselves on their own, or if a group wanted to pull together to do something then the group, doing touristy things or shopping if they chose not to participate in the conference itself. I believe I overheard many talk about going out to dinner before returning to their hotel room to relax and rest for the next day. Your wife may very well be content to do something along these lines. While you are \u201cworking\u201d she can have her vacation where she shops or sees local attractions, then you both could enjoy a dinner together, after which your both return to your room for a relaxing night or she returns to the room while you spend some time networking at the hotel bar. Sit down and talk to her about it. Make it clear that much of the time you\u2019re in the room you will likely want to simply rest and recharge in preparation of the next day, so no \u201ctalking shop\u201d but you would be happy to hear about how her day went over dinner, or for a short time before you sleep. Also make it clear that there is likely to be an evening or two that you are going to want to go chat with participants from other companies for networking, so that may take a chunk of your time that you would otherwise be spending with her in the room just relaxing. It could very well be that your wife just wants to have a little bit of time with you where she doesn\u2019t have to be worrying about cooking, cleaning the dishes, cleaning the house, or any other number of things that typically happen which could cut into her alone with you time.", "Will you even have your own room?  Many companies save a bit of money by having staff share a room at conference.\n\nAs well as speaker sessions, there will likely be networking events each evening.  You should really be going to those too, and meeting people. \n\nPeople who haven\u2019t travelled for work think it\u2019s a holiday, and that\u2019s what your wife sees, and all expenses paid holiday. But it\u2019s not, it\u2019s work in a different location. \n\nNTA", "NTA partners don't belong at work conferences 99% of the time. The 1% is when the company has made it clear they're welcome.", "NTA, even if you did want to enjoy some time drink with your colleagues that is a perfectly valid reason", "This was my initial suggestion to her but it did not go over well. We don't have children, so there is no burdensome responsibility at home. I also suggested she take a girls' trip somewhere over the winter but also did not go over well. It's the stubborn German in her. I have no reason to think she wants to oversee all my activities, but me doing something without her just pains her to the bone.", "Someone else suggested the same and I'm ashamed to admit I hadn't even thought of that. Thank you for the level-headed response.", "Nobody else is bringing their spouses. I am the youngest one of the 6 to be attending.\n\nA vacation at the end is something I hadn't considered before but I will try to bring this up to her as a consolation. Thank you for the insight to a new approach.", "I'm going to enter a conversation with her about what both my and her expectations are. I replied to someone else that I admit the topic of conversation wasn't expectations, but rather assumptions. It brought an entirely new angle to the conversation and made me realize I'm searching for validation from reddit rather than just communicating what expectations might be laid out between her and I.", "Your words are the rationale I wish I could verbalize: Expectations. In truth, yes, it's a free hotel room for her and gives her the time to do things I may not want/have time to do. I'm afraid that she's going to go into this with entirely different expectations and I'm going to be on the hook for how she feels the entire time. I need to start a conversation clarifying what my expectations are against hers. Thank you for the level-headedness that I don't always carry.", "But he knows his wife a lot better than you do. If he doesn't think that she'd be able to go off on her own, I believe him.", "Seriously, no one else is bringing spouses should be all the info she needs.", "Someone else commented that what we're not communicating is what both of our expectations may be, and I think it is the correct approach. I have been so worried about the what-ifs that I haven't flat out said that she can't expect me to indulge her whims when I'm focused on work. I need to reevaluate and take into consideration what both of our expectations are, I'm just assuming the worst. Once I have a level head again, I need to bring up the topic of Expectations. I'll be in a room by myself, why wouldn't I want to share that with my wife? It's the expectations that I dread. I don't have many close friends to share my anxiety with and I'm looking to reddit for validation.", "The stubborn German in her would know to seperate work and leisure.", "Nta. She's being unreasonable. I used to go on work trips all the time because i love solo travel.  I would spend the entire day exploring while he worked, then we'd meet up for dinner unless he was having dinner with colleagues. Id wake up the same time as he needed to be awake and we'd often have breakfast together. There was very little sight seeing together, and we both knew and accepted that. Your situation is not the same and you will end up stressed out if she comes with you.", "Often you can stay in the same hotel with the group rates your company negotiated. If your wife likes the idea (and you like the hotel), check with the person coordinating the meeting.", "Unfortunately you\u2019re probably going to have to schmooz in the evenings if you really want to build out your network. \n\nI worked for a wonderful guy and he brought his wife on every business trip. It was the strangest thing ever. Every colleague talked about it behind his back and nobody else would have even considered doing the same even though many of us had wonderful relationships. You just don\u2019t really do that sort of thing. And if you do end up having to shmooz at the bar to get connections what is she gonna be doing? You\u2019re all going to be shop talking.", "I think the first thing you should check is if your job would even be ok with your wife being in a hotel room they're paying for. This may be frowned upon with some companies, so you have to make sure there's nothing jeopardizing your job if you and your wife can find a compromise. \n\nPersonally, I would never want to go to a conference with a partner. Maybe your wife needs a better perspective of what conferences are actually like if she hasn't experienced that before, because they are flat out exhausting especially for an introvert (like me!). It's like putting a work day on turbo speed. By the time you're done with the conference activities all you're going to want to do is go to your room take a shower and go to bed. Make sure she REALLY gets that.", "Set boundaries, communicate them clearly, then the responsibility is off your shoulders- you're off the hook. It's her job to respect your boundaries and your work, entertain herself, and not hold you responsible for her having a \"good time\". But only you know your wife - if you doubt her ability to respect boundaries or take responsibility for herself, then simply consider extending the trip on your own dime and flying her out later. Regardless if she comes or not it's a excellent opportunity to strengthen communication.", "I hear you, and I think you're starting to think more in husband mode. Good thinking.", "I went on many  business  conferences with my husband over the years. The business  part was never a full day, many spouses attended and there was a lot of organized social events......golf games etc. It was probably the only way we could have afforded these vacation spots. Over the 10-15 I attended they were not packed with business.\n ,", "I think the difference is that with my trips absolutely no one else ever considered bringing a spouse, whereas the ones you went on they were clearly welcome. It\u2019s kind of a big difference when there is only one spouse there. And on the trips we went on and the one Op is describing it\u2019s a full day thing.", "I hope so because there were many guys there acting single."]}
