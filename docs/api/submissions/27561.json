Rita moved back in with me and my husband (her stepdad) when the place she was renting with her bf 22m, and a former roommate fell through. Rita and her bf are still together and decided to keep the baby. The bf lives about an hour and a half away.\n\nAnyhow, Rita does absolutely nothing. She doesn't work or go to school. She'll watch TV until 5-6am then sleep until 1-2pm most days. Only cleans her room when I tell her to. Doesn't wash dishes or her laundry, nor does she take out the trash. When I try to talk to her she starts crying and screaming that I hate her and I'm trying to stress her out and she can't deal with it. (My other young adult kid is in college full time and works part time. They were raised with the same rules and expectations.)\n\nI tried telling Rita she's having a baby soon and she needs to grow up. Cue more crying and screaming. She literally throws herself on the floor and sobs. That she needs to get her act together to take care of the baby and try to be a decent parent. That the baby is hers, not mine and her and her bf responsibility to raise and provide for. That she needs to go to school or work or both and apply for daycare vouchers and any assistance she can. That she needs to pull her head out of the sand and actually do something with her life. (I had kids young, but I also went to school part time for several years to achieve my goals.)\n\nThese conversations always end with Rita on the floor, crying, screaming and basically throwing a tantrum. The only time she does anything is when either I force her to or her bf picks her up. Other than that, she'll go 4-5 days without showering or changing clothes. I've told her that has to stop. I love her but I'm not raising her baby or taking care of her like a child. She knows what's right and expected of her. Rita says I'm the ah because I'm turning my back on her and my grandchild and if they suffer its my fault because I have the ability to give them a good life and home with plenty of stability but I'd rather make her struggle.

This isn\u2019t normal behaviour. You need to put her in therapy and give her a due date of when she needs to leave your house. \n\nThe tantrums are being done so you leave her alone and let her do nothing.

Then it will be the exact same situation, except now you also have to raise her baby.", "NTA, but we all know how this is going to play out. She won't get a job or study, she won't do anything, and you will be stuck raising this baby. She is 24 and having tantrums, which is not normal. Has she been to a physcologist or therapy? Look she needs serious mental help. She is too comfortable with the status quo and isn't looking to change her ways.\n\nAs harsh as it sounds, I'd kick her out. It is the only way for her to take responsibility and get her shit together.

I would force the issue if necessary.", "It sounds like your daughter is suffering from severe depression. You aren\u2019t going to be able to berate that out of her.

Telling her how she\u2019s an utter failure in life while also telling her she\u2019s not going to be able to care for the baby while she\u2019s in this state will likely exacerbate her symptoms. \n\nThis is serious. People who are depressed enough to stop showering and fall on the floor crying when confronted with big stuff in the near future are at a high risk of dying by suicide. She really needs your support now, because she needs help and you need her to trust you when you say that. She is also overwhelmed, so you may need to help her take the first steps, like seeing a doctor or finding a therapist.", "NTA. That would be a quick and easy GTFO. Go live with your bf.", "If she is going not sleeping, 4 or 5 days without showering or changing clothes than she is about to bring a child into a mental health crisis which has the strong possibility of getting much worse after she gives birth and postpartum depression is added to the mix. \n\nMoralizing won\u2019t improve her mental health nor will blaming or judging nor comparing her to sibling or yourself when you were her age. She is still young enough that she may need parenting to navigate the convergence of a few significant crisis. \n\nYour daughter needs help getting herself to the appropriate medical/mental health care professionals she needs. If she throws herself on the floor than don\u2019t participate but calmly tell her this convo will resume after she can pull herself together and walk away. Keep going back until she agrees to get treatment. If she refuses then you confer with your doctor and a mental health provider about the best next steps. She must get help now. \n\nThat is your best hope for getting her out of your home and on the path to healthy independence.", "NTA.\n\nyour daughter definitely needs to get her nonsense together. if the baby is not going to have stability, then its her and her bf's fault. they made the bed, they should lie in it. maybe your daughter might benefit from being kicked out of the house and having to stay with the BF (sounds too harsh though). \n\none things that she definitely needs to be doing to start to help with small things around the house. you can demand that no help with given to her, unless she starts showing that its worth helping her out at all.", "NTA.

He can come pick her up or leave her on the curb, either way she was getting out.

She apparently needs to learn the hard way.", "NTA for telling her but you are an AH for letting this continue.  Do you really think she will do anything with the baby once she has it.  It will all be on you. You need to sit her down and talk with her. She is going to be a parent and needs to act like it.  Give her a time frame to get a place with her baby daddy and stick to it.

She is likely overwhelmed with the thought of becoming a mom and is handling it in the worst way possible. She will have to face reality at some point.

I don't think coddling her or giving in to her tantrums will help her in the long run.", "This is another post that is a lot to unpack. You have some major issues going on. I feel for you. Your daughter is not at all ready for the responsibility of a baby. She already has it in her head, she is going to have this child and  live with you. She has already decided that you are her money tree, roof over head. She has decided you will be her end game. The next logical step would be to call her boyfriend, sit down together, you, Rita, the boyfriend, all involved parties. Start with you love your daughter and want what is best for her. Lay out the issues and concerns you have. The lack of maturity, not doing her part around the home, the lack of hygiene. What is their plan because they are a family now, they need to figure it out. You are not going to house her forever. Is the boyfriend aware of her total lack of...well everything? Is he aware that she isn't showering, she isn't taking care of herself, therefore she isn't doing the bare minimum to ensure a healthy baby and pregnancy? I really do wonder if boyfriend is aware of the real situation or is she filling his head with BS about how she is saving money, preparing for a child, doing the right things. \n\nNTA", "Sounds to me like Rita needs to go move in with her baby daddy.", "She might be depressed.

Which means job or school, chores in the house, and a curfew\u2026yes at 30 years old a curfew, but her house her rules! This will set expectations for her.

Mental health can change depending on circumstances, and fluctuate over time, and hormones affect it too. For me, (3rd pregnancy now) pregnancy is a fast ride to being incredibly mentally ill.

This also can be a sign of neurodivergence- some people with ADHD or ASD struggle with self care because of sensory issues. There are questionnaires available on the internet to begin to pinpoint possible causes of this behavior. These websites also can help to get an appointment with a therapist- at least on line. The first thing you need to do is going to be difficult because of the baggage that the two of you carry. Having a calm and non judgemental conversation about the behaviors. Does she recognize that her reaction to criticism is a problem. Is she performative to shut you up. Is she overwhelmed and having problems with self regulation. Are her pregnancy hormones exacerbating underlying problems. You may need to write out your questions and concerns to at least make sure your wording is non judgemental and supportive. You may need to present your concerns in a well thought out and carefully edited letter, if conversation always devolves into screaming and tears. If she recognizes that she has a problem, her OB may be able to get her a quicker appointment with a therapist. Does her dad, or her boyfriend see the problems? Do either have a better chance of communicating the issues to her without causing a melt down? The important thing is not to be right, it's to be constructively able to communicate that her behaviors are her responsibility to manage. Sometimes, finding out that you have a medical reason for your behaviors can make a huge difference ( she's not crazy, lazy or stupid, she has a condition that she can learn to manage)", "Well what's the mother suppose to do?

If you do care about your grandchild, now is the time to put your foot down about your daughter's behavior. Can you imagine what sort of mother she'd be if she continued like this? That poor child. \n\nThat means she needs to start taking on responsibility. I agree with the other posters on here - tough love and clear expectations are the way to go, and yes, kicking her out of the house may be necessary for her to get the message that she *cannot* behave this way and absolutely *has* to make some kind of changes.
