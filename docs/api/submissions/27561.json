Rita moved back in with me and my husband (her stepdad) when the place she was renting with her bf 22m, and a former roommate fell through. Rita and her bf are still together and decided to keep the baby. The bf lives about an hour and a half away.\n\nAnyhow, Rita does absolutely nothing. She doesn't work or go to school. She'll watch TV until 5-6am then sleep until 1-2pm most days. Only cleans her room when I tell her to. Doesn't wash dishes or her laundry, nor does she take out the trash. When I try to talk to her she starts crying and screaming that I hate her and I'm trying to stress her out and she can't deal with it. (My other young adult kid is in college full time and works part time. They were raised with the same rules and expectations.)\n\nI tried telling Rita she's having a baby soon and she needs to grow up. Cue more crying and screaming. She literally throws herself on the floor and sobs. That she needs to get her act together to take care of the baby and try to be a decent parent. That the baby is hers, not mine and her and her bf responsibility to raise and provide for. That she needs to go to school or work or both and apply for daycare vouchers and any assistance she can. That she needs to pull her head out of the sand and actually do something with her life. (I had kids young, but I also went to school part time for several years to achieve my goals.)\n\nThese conversations always end with Rita on the floor, crying, screaming and basically throwing a tantrum. The only time she does anything is when either I force her to or her bf picks her up. Other than that, she'll go 4-5 days without showering or changing clothes. I've told her that has to stop. I love her but I'm not raising her baby or taking care of her like a child. She knows what's right and expected of her. Rita says I'm the ah because I'm turning my back on her and my grandchild and if they suffer its my fault because I have the ability to give them a good life and home with plenty of stability but I'd rather make her struggle.

This isn\u2019t normal behaviour. You need to put her in therapy and give her a due date of when she needs to leave your house. \n\nThe tantrums are being done so you leave her alone and let her do nothing.

Then it will be the exact same situation, except now you also have to raise her baby.", "NTA, but we all know how this is going to play out. She won't get a job or study, she won't do anything, and you will be stuck raising this baby. She is 24 and having tantrums, which is not normal. Has she been to a physcologist or therapy? Look she needs serious mental help. She is too comfortable with the status quo and isn't looking to change her ways.\n\nAs harsh as it sounds, I'd kick her out. It is the only way for her to take responsibility and get her shit together.

I would force the issue if necessary.", "It sounds like your daughter is suffering from severe depression. You aren\u2019t going to be able to berate that out of her.

Telling her how she\u2019s an utter failure in life while also telling her she\u2019s not going to be able to care for the baby while she\u2019s in this state will likely exacerbate her symptoms. \n\nThis is serious. People who are depressed enough to stop showering and fall on the floor crying when confronted with big stuff in the near future are at a high risk of dying by suicide. She really needs your support now, because she needs help and you need her to trust you when you say that. She is also overwhelmed, so you may need to help her take the first steps, like seeing a doctor or finding a therapist.", "NTA. That would be a quick and easy GTFO. Go live with your bf.", "If she is going not sleeping, 4 or 5 days without showering or changing clothes than she is about to bring a child into a mental health crisis which has the strong possibility of getting much worse after she gives birth and postpartum depression is added to the mix. \n\nMoralizing won\u2019t improve her mental health nor will blaming or judging nor comparing her to sibling or yourself when you were her age. She is still young enough that she may need parenting to navigate the convergence of a few significant crisis. \n\nYour daughter needs help getting herself to the appropriate medical/mental health care professionals she needs. If she throws herself on the floor than don\u2019t participate but calmly tell her this convo will resume after she can pull herself together and walk away. Keep going back until she agrees to get treatment. If she refuses then you confer with your doctor and a mental health provider about the best next steps. She must get help now. \n\nThat is your best hope for getting her out of your home and on the path to healthy independence.", "NTA.\n\nyour daughter definitely needs to get her nonsense together. if the baby is not going to have stability, then its her and her bf's fault. they made the bed, they should lie in it. maybe your daughter might benefit from being kicked out of the house and having to stay with the BF (sounds too harsh though). \n\none things that she definitely needs to be doing to start to help with small things around the house. you can demand that no help with given to her, unless she starts showing that its worth helping her out at all.", "NTA.

You have a husband to consider.", "I would also take her to an adoption agency, be that run by a charitable organization, church - if you're into that, etc.  She is not ready to be a parent and her behavior borders on mental disorder.

He can come pick her up or leave her on the curb, either way she was getting out.  He picked her up and she lived with his family until they got their own place.\n\nYou may need to do that type of tough love.  Tell her she has x amount of days to move and let the bf know the same.  She is not a teenager, she can figure it out.\n\nNTA", "Perinatal mood disorders and depression are very serious and it sounds like she\u2019s in the thick of it.

She apparently needs to learn the hard way.", "NTA for telling her but you are an AH for letting this continue.  Do you really think she will do anything with the baby once she has it.  It will all be on you. You need to sit her down and talk with her. She is going to be a parent and needs to act like it.  Give her a time frame to get a place with her baby daddy and stick to it.

She is likely overwhelmed with the thought of becoming a mom and is handling it in the worst way possible. She will have to face reality at some point.

I don't think coddling her or giving in to her tantrums will help her in the long run.", "This is another post that is a lot to unpack. You have some major issues going on. I feel for you. Your daughter is not at all ready for the responsibility of a baby. She already has it in her head, she is going to have this child and  live with you. She has already decided that you are her money tree, roof over head. She has decided you will be her end game. The next logical step would be to call her boyfriend, sit down together, you, Rita, the boyfriend, all involved parties. Start with you love your daughter and want what is best for her. Lay out the issues and concerns you have. The lack of maturity, not doing her part around the home, the lack of hygiene. What is their plan because they are a family now, they need to figure it out. You are not going to house her forever. Is the boyfriend aware of her total lack of...well everything? Is he aware that she isn't showering, she isn't taking care of herself, therefore she isn't doing the bare minimum to ensure a healthy baby and pregnancy? I really do wonder if boyfriend is aware of the real situation or is she filling his head with BS about how she is saving money, preparing for a child, doing the right things. \n\nNTA", "Sounds to me like Rita needs to go move in with her baby daddy.", "She might be depressed.

Which means job or school, chores in the house, and a curfew\u2026yes at 30 years old a curfew, but her house her rules! This will set expectations for her.

Does she recognize that her reaction to criticism is a problem. Is she performative to shut you up. Is she overwhelmed and having problems with self regulation. Are her pregnancy hormones exacerbating underlying problems. You may need to write out your questions and concerns to at least make sure your wording is non judgemental and supportive.

Your last day here is October 31\u201d and then walk out of the room.

They will have the knowledge necessary to best advise you about how to proceed. \n\nI would also suggest reporting her situation in all its severity to CPS. You need to make sure that whether she wants it or not, her innocent baby is with people who can make sure he/she is properly cared for. If she cannot/will not care for herself, there is no way that she can possibly care for any child, let alone a newborn. Her baby will absolutely not be safe with her until she has taken major steps to get herself help and improve her circumstances. If she takes the necessary steps, she can be reunited with her baby.

You're happy to help her do that, but you won't be doing everything for her.

Tell her there's no point in crying because it's not going to change anything and it's not going to guilt you into ignoring the issues, and you need to start making plans. Do not give in to her tantrum. \nStart by saying that you are happy for her to stay with you while she saves up for a flat and the baby supplies. But in order to do that she needs to get a job.

Write up her CV etc. \nThen make a list of chores she can do around the house till she gets a job, and then maybe revisit that list when she starts working and is more heavily pregnant. But for now, make a list of chores, and explain that while she's staying under your roof, she needs to pitch in and help. She's not allowed to just sit around watching TV all day. She would be doing chores if she were still living with her bf and friend. So that doesn't stop just coz she's living with you. As she's not paying rent, she needs to help with chores. \nThen once she has a job, make a plan for them to start saving a big portion of it so they can have a down payment on a flat together. And ask the boyfriend to save a percentage of his paycheck etc. \nIf you're able to help with putting the rent down-payment on a flat, let her know how much you'd be willing to contribute so you can start looking at suitable flats as soon as she starts working. \nDiscuss with the bf what his income is and what his outgoings are and work out how much they can realistically afford on rent each month, and how much to budget on baby supplies etc. They may need help with figuring out these type of budgeting plans. And how much to save from their pay checks. \nMaybe look at ways they can save money on certain things like their food shop etc. Finding different stores that are cheaper or looking for deals on baby items. \nThen let her know that she needs to do this now, because she will not be able to continuously live with you with the baby for the long term. Maybe give her a date that she needs to aim to move out by. Set her goals and targets. Otherwise she will delay and delay and delay. Again let her know that you will be happy to help her with the baby, whether it's babysitting at certain times, or helping her find child care, finding out what funding she's entitled to for child care if she's working etc. \n\nAnd let her know if she doesn't start contributing by doing chores. Tidying up after herself, and actually starts looking for a job and making plans, then she can't continue staying with you. Sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind. If she continues to ignore this and just start crying at every attempt of a conversation, and has a tantrum, she's not ready to be a mother. And you need to say that to her. She needs to grow up and face reality. If she continues to ignore it, whats going to happen when the baby is here and she's bought nothing for the baby and has no means of income. \n\nShe is likely expecting you to take care of everything, the finances and the baby.

Telling her what you expect but not having any consequences for when she doesn\u2019t do said things. Either have consequences for her to get her to grow up and follow through or just accept you\u2019re going to be taking care of and providing for her and the baby and probably the bf eventually and stop complaining about it.", "Doesn't matter, one or both of them will have to get a part time job to afford the additional costs. That's how life works, and taking away the consequences of their actions means they're not going to learn why spending all of your money on a car is a bad choice", "I feel like you ignored most of the advice in the post above about how to deal with your daughter.", "Yeah so many people recommending \u201ctough love\u201d  which can just make this situation worse. This woman is in a deep depressive state and cannot think rationally. Coming at her daughter with compassion and concern, avoiding ultimatums, and suggestions of all the things she needs to do like applying for daycare vouchers etc. at least for the time being. The most important thing right now is pulling her out of this deep hole. OP should reach out to a professional to advise her on how she can successfully get her daughter professional. Maybe it\u2019s the OBGYN or someone else.", "Yep, me too. Same behavior. I\u2019m now on medication.", "If it's been undiagnosed so far and the coping and masking strategies she developed herself no longer work, she could be having breakdowns as she's simply getting overwhelmed by things. Having a child is a fairly common moment for women who undiagnosed neurodivergence to crash as a result.", "A lot of mental health illnesses start showing around 18-25 years of age because it\u2019s a stressful time - kids are going away to college or realizing that it\u2019s time they have to start growing up and making choices that will directly affect the type of future that they will have. \n\n75% of mental health diagnoses begin by age 24 - mental health illnesses and symptoms start showing. Anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder are among the most common illnesses to be diagnosed around this age. \n\nWhile none of us can be sure if Rita has a mental health illness, it\u2019s something worth looking into, though it\u2019s impossible for you to get her help if she doesn\u2019t want it\u2026that\u2019s the conundrum\u2026but maybe talking to her doctors about her behavior can be helpful\u2026and depending on the type of relationship you have with her boyfriend, maybe you can ask him if he\u2019s noticed any changes in her behavior and tell him that you\u2019re worried about her while trying to be as non-confrontational as possible. If you can tell that he would react the same way as Rita or that he won\u2019t take it well then don\u2019t tell him anything as it could make things worse. \n\nI\u2019m really sorry about the position you\u2019re in.

Why take care of my gf and baby when her mommy will do it for us!", "Rita\u2019s probably been doing this for 22 years.", "To be fair, selling the car might not be viable at this point. Depending on when and what condition he bought the car in, he is most likely upside down in the car and needs the transportation to get to work. \n\nHe still needs to figure something out whether that is a second or third job, cutting down other expenses, or encouraging her to give the baby up for adoption because they just cannot take care of it.", "Sounds like they'll probably be sucking off the government....", "This.

Adhd is a neurodivergence so under the same umbrella as ASD. Overstimulation or negative thoughts can cause meltdowns. She also is likely masking in front of the boyfriend. That being said, it will get worse not better without treatment. Enlist the boyfriend to help but focus on getting her to therapy with someone who can prescribe medication or can diagnose and works for doctors who prescribe medication.", "I don\u2019t think that she was treated beforehand either, unfortunately.

That is foolhardy and her behavior is unsafe for the fetus.
