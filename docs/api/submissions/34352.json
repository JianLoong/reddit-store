We all pay rent here equally. My brother stays at our house too while in college. \nWe agreed to let my aunt use our house as a meeting point for my niece\u2019s father\u2019s family to see her once in a while. Our house is in the middle of everyone and my mom plays a mediator roll for their visits. Everytime they have used our house, one of us 3 renters were home. Side note: my aunt and niece live with my grandmother. Over the Holidays my mom went out of town with my grandmother. So it was just me and my husband home. My aunt called me and said that she \u201cmight\u201d have my nieces family come over on Wednesday. There was no time or details told to me. Either way, I told her that no one would be home on Wednesday because of work and a party we had to go to at night. I asked her to call my mom to see when she would be back from her trip. Since she would most likely be home Wednesday sometime.  My aunt said \u201cok\u201d. And that was the end of the conversation. \n\nOn Wednesday, my husband and I went to work. We locked up the house like a normal day. Then I get a txt from my aunt asking why the garage door was locked. I advised her that no one was home. She said \u201cyou knew I was coming here so why would you lock the door\u201d. I was so confused by this because I had told her that no one was going to be home. She then blew up at me saying that she had made plans with me to use the house and said I need to take it up with my landlord since she was told she can use the house as a meeting place. She called my mom and told her that I locked her out on purpose. Then went and got a house key from my brother. My husband txted our house group chat asking us why she was at our house with other people while no one was home. My mom said she didn\u2019t know what was going on since she was out of town. My mom said that aunt txted her that she was going to be there on Wednesday, but my mom told her she needed to talk to me and my husband about it first.\n\nMy aunt sent me some nasty messages telling me that my perception of reality is off. And I am going against the agreement she had with my mom. I advised her that she is able to use our house if one of us is home. She now has my grandmother mad at me tellin her that I am being mean to her. I showed my mom and my husband the messages that were exchanged. They both agreed that I handled the situation with respect. My aunt was the one being rude to me. \nMy grandmother thinks my aunt can come and go as she wants with strangers at our house since she is family and my grandmother owns the house. My mom, husband and I think this was very rude of my aunt and we do not want strangers in our home when we are not there even though my aunt will be there.  We are renters there so it should be up to us.

Unfortunately she will throw you under the bus again and toot the horn.\n\nYou are renters (and location depending) you have rights on who enters the house. Now is the time to get your mom, gma, together with you and your husband and write/text a message to your Aunt stating: Moving forward, you will have access to house based on these conditions. \n\nIt's a new year, create what you want; don't cower to her entitled inconsiderate side.", "NTA.  You're effectively a tenant at your grandmother's house, but she wants to treat you like a houseguest who pays rent instead.  Find a place to live where the landlord doesn't expect you to open your residence up to friends and family whenever they want. If your aunt wants to use the house whenever, she can move in and pay rent instead.", "NTA however guilty of poor communication, from your tone in your message to us we can tell that the answer is no however you don't explicitly say no to her, you instead say that \"no one will be home\" which could be interpreted as yes but no one's home or no but no one's home, your aunt has interpreted it as the first and had a poor reaction to being told yes then no ( in her head). That being said your aunt's reaction tells you a lot about her and how she handles situations.", "NTA. The landlord doesn't get to let random people use the renters' home.", "NTA. Aunt was way off base. Even she admitted she had permission if one person was there but no one was there. I would write up some kind of contract with provisions and make her sign it and make sure she understands if no one is home she doesn\u2019t go in. Either that or end it as being her meeting place", "NTA\n\nlandlords need to get permission from tenants to enter the premises. if you have an official rental contract from your grandmother, then she's the landlord and legally cannot dictate which private individuals enter your home -- even if it's her house. you need to clarify this with your grandmother as well as your aunt. if it gets awkward, it might be a better situation to move out altogether.", "NTA \n\nIf you don\u2019t have your Grandmothers support is it possible for the three of you to move out and purchase a home together?", "NTA. Discuss this with GM. Let her know that Aunt can't use the house if no one is home. If GM insists that Aunt be able to use the house when you are not home, then consider moving out. If you move out and rent another place, then Aunt can't use your home even if you are there and the new renters of GM's house won't allow it either. This would be a lose-lose for Aunt and GM.", "It sounds like you didn't explicitly tell her no when she originally called. But you were clear on the second call and she went and got a key anyway.\n\nIf the landlord has granted her access while you're not home and you're not comfortable with that, your best option is to give notice and move. With no provision in the lease, the landlord may very well have committed a tortious offense, but you gain nothing by pursuing it. This is family, and you've been accommodating. Find another place to live.\n\nNTA", "ESH. You are renting from a family member (bad idea to start with) and that family member is saying that it is okay to have someone there who doesn't live there. Do you have a lease? Is the property run by property management or is grandma the \"landlord?\" These things all matter. IF it is run by property management, NO your aunt cannot be there without permission as she is not on the lease. IF you live in grandma's house on a verbal agreement, she can do what she wants- it's her house.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
