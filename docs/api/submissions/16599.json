We're going to a water park for the day. This is what I did for hers when I was 16 and we both had a great time. She knows I'm not really a fancy dinner kind of girl or a club girl either. So she figured, why not do what we enjoyed before. She also raised me from the age of 14 after our parents died, so she means the world to me. Invites for the party went out to the group on the list. My future MIL and SIL were like what the hell is this, this isn't a bachelorette party. They asked me why I didn't include them and why my sister handled the whole thing. I said my sister is my MOH (and only bridesmaid technically) and she wanted to do this for me. They know mine and my sister's history, they are aware that this is what I planned for hers when she was getting married. They also know I'm not a very formal kind of person or a party animal. But both of them claimed this was a childish party and not something a future bride should be doing to celebrate her engagement or wedding. They told me it might be understandable that a teenager who knows no better would arrange something like this but a grown woman in her 30s should know better. I told them they did not have to be rude and my sister was planning something I would enjoy instead of something she knows I won't have fun during.\n\nThey were complaining that they are too old, too offended and all kinds of other comments about the party. They are yet to RSVP to my sister also. So when they complained to me repeatedly I told them nobody is forcing them to come and if it is so offensive to them, RSVPing no is a valid choice and nobody will give them crap for it.\n\nThey told me we will all be family soon and I should not be so casually telling them I do not want them there. Their comment annoyed me when they had been bitching about it for a while. But maybe I am TA for this. My fiance told his mom and sister they are being crazy over the top and ridiculous and that not everything will be exactly how they want it. They told him what I said and how I am telling my future family their presence is not wanted. He shrugged them off.

I like how you did it for your sister and now she gets to do it for you. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nFrom your post, your MIL and SIL ridiculing the idea makes them TA. Not cool at all. \n\nINFO: However, I do have a clarifying question, when you say they are older, how old are they? The last few lines of your post indicate that they want to feel included and that you saying it doesn\u2019t matter if they don\u2019t come hurt them. \n\nYou are still in the right to have your party where you wish! No doubt at all\u2026 but is it that they can\u2019t attend? Like, will they not be able to enjoy the park because they can\u2019t go down slides due to problems with their body, and (although they are being immature and not communicating clearly) do they simply want to be able to spend time with you in a less fast paced setting? They are expressing it poorly, but maybe that\u2019s why they are opposed to the idea. \n\nMy SIL had a bridal shower and a bachelorette party. The young crowd was at the part,  and the older and young crowd when to the bridal shower. Are you having a bridal shower?\n\nAgain, although they are 100% TA for the rude comments, the vibe I kind of got from your post is that they want to spend time with you, but the water park idea threw them as they thought you were having a traditional bachelorette party, and they don\u2019t think they can hack it. They sound traditional\u2026 are they?", "NTA and kudos to your fianc\u00e9 for defending you.", "NTA.  You didn't tell them you didn't want them there.

Your sister sounds amazing!", "NTA.   Keep saying pleasantly that you are looking forward to a wonderful occasion that suits you perfectly and they are welcome to come and you won't be offended if they choose not to.\n\nPeople do all sorts of activities for such events.

So it might be worth saying now that you will invite them to all sorts of events in the coming years. Because you are adventurous, they may not like some of them and will probably like others.  Inviting them to something they don't like is just an indication that they are welcome to come and not a statement about anything else.", "Their presence is wanted.

My sister is the worst. Just terrible thinking of me for my own bachelorette party. Who does that??? :O", "Or having the bachelorette party that she wants. And they can chose not to come.

Neither of those things is something I enjoy personally lol.", "Apparently you and your rude family. Honestly though  .... waterpark sounds fun. For mine, my bestie did a joint bachelor/Bachelorette scavenger hunt through our town then a very low key dinner at a bring your own wine not fancy resto. \n\nThese events are for the people getting married so they should reflect who they are. I think you will have a nice time without them. Your sis sounds thoughtful and I hope you have a blast.", "Thanks for the clarification Op! \n\nThey have to come to terms that your bachelorette party is not going to be traditional or what they have done in the past like your husband told them. It would have simply been a difference of opinion, except they started making rude remarks and criticizing the party. All of that made them TA. \n\nIf the relationship is tense right now, a sit down conversation is in order\u2026 they owe you an apology for critiquing your party rudely, and they need to understand that you have different wants. They need to accept that and love you as you are and respect the bond you have with your sister. \n\nThey may be disappointed they don\u2019t get to experience the \u201ctraditional\u201d bachelorette party or bridal shower and celebrate you that way, but they need to accept that. You want them there, but not if they are going to complain and wreck it for others. Keep up your boundaries! \n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffdI would send your fianc\u00e9 back with all of this if they keep up their stance.

This is about you and no one else.\n\nAll this is with them is a control issue and a warped sense of entitlement. \"*How dare she marry into this family and tell us we don't have to attend and that she wont change everything because it's not what* ***we*** *want?!*\" Yah, because that sounds completely reasonable /s (it absolutely does not, they are ridiculous)\n\nThis is your hill to die on, sweetie. This is where you show them their manipulation will not work, that you wont bend to their utterly irrational demands, and that they don't take precedence over you and your husband. This also sets a pattern that you will clearly need for the future should you have kids. Granny and auntie do not make the rules, MOM does. Best they learn this now and fast.\n\nAlso, stop feeling bad. They literally lied about what you said in the hopes of trying to cause damage to your relationship with your husband. At no point did you say you didn't want them there. You simply heard their complaints and (kindly) told them no one will take offense if they choose to rsvp that they cannot attend. Because clearly sitting on a chair, talking to people and sharing food/drinks is out of their comfort zone (regardless of location, since they could just as easily come and not go frolic in the water).\n\nYou all know their excuses are bs. You know it. Hubby knows it. And now they know they've been called out. Good :)", "NTA\n\nIts not their party, it's as simple as that. It is literally for YOU.

Your party, you should do what you want. \n\nSecond - I\u2019m glad your fianc\u00e9e is backing you here. You two are going to want to discuss boundaries with MIL and SIL that you want for your relationship because they\u2019re already showing that they have no issue with steamrolling you to get what they want.

Low-key ones like yours ftw!", "NTA. Except your first mistake was to invite your mother-in-law. She is the last person I want at my party, sister-in-law too for that matter.", "NTA\n\nYikes, your in laws are just no\u2019s. Go to the water park. You may as well practice not giving into their ridiculous requests, judgements and demands now. Boundaries are your friend.", "NTA  I'm way older than you and me and my husband love water parks.  Your SIL and MIL sound uppity.  Have fun and enjoy your day.", "what they want u to do??  beg them to participate in something they already said they didnt want to??  \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA \n\nThr bachelorette party is about you and this is not a 1 size gits all situation.", "Nta, \nTell them they can plan you something separate for you if they are that concerned", "They\u2019re bullies and babies lol\n\nEnjoy the water park", "NTA.  Its NOT that you do not want them there, its that they don't want to go. And you have said they can make that choice and no one will give them grief about it. They are trying to dictate what type of party you can have. Stick to your guns. And don't let them guilt you. Just sweetly say, \"I would love you to come, but completely understand if you don't want to.\"", "NTA. A waterpark bachelorette sounds super fun.", "INFO: you wrote:\n\n>\u201dI told them they did not have to be rude and my sister was planning something I would enjoy instead of something she knows I won\u2019t have fun doing\u2026So when they complained to me repeatedly I told them nobody is forcing them to come and if it so offensive to them, RSVPing no is a valid choice and no one will give them crap for it.\u201d\n\nYou also wrote:\n\n>\u201dThey told him what I said and how I am telling my future family their presence is not wanted.\u201d\n\nUnless you left it out, I can\u2019t find anywhere where you told your future MIL and SIL that \u201ctheir presence was not wanted\u201d no matter how many times I read it. You told them they were free to decline and you\u2019d be doing something you enjoy. \n\nSo did you say that to them and leave it out or are they just taking offence at anything and everything and running with it? I would not be surprised if it\u2019s the later and they are saying whatever they can think of to make you look bad as they get more desperate. \n\nUnless you did in fact tell them you wanted them there, there\u2019s no way you the AH so I\u2019d vote NTA. \n\nIf you did say it to them (and didn\u2019t put it in your post) I\u2019d still say NTA, and that I wouldn\u2019t blame you for one second: they turned themselves in unwanted attendees with their egomania.", "NTA - Also I think it's the best bachelorette party idea I have ever heard and I think that if I ever marry I want this exactly kind of bachelorette party - it sounds so fun!  Way more fun than fancy dinners or clich\u00e9 trips", "NTA Cost effective, wholesome, fun that everyone can enjoy. And they have an issue with it? Glad your fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t an asswipe and is on your side. I\u2019m happy you found out early that he won\u2019t be a doormat to his family and will stick with you. 10/10 best option.", "NTA. They have actively complained about not wanting to go. You gave them a way out. No harm or foul if they don\u2019t show. But instead they complain and try and twist the situation to make it like you don\u2019t want them there. In general why would you want them there if they\u2019re going to miserable and complain the whole time. The bachelorette is about you and something you would like to do. Hell if I lived in Florida I would go to one of the Disney parks for my outing.", "So they can casually say how immature you are, but you can't casually tell them they don't have to go because \"family?\" Nta.

They need to sit down and shut up.", "NTA. Can I come to your bachelorette party? It sounds like fun!", "NTA. \n\nNTA by a mile. \n\nI will say this though. My wife does not do well in the sun. All her adult life she has struggled at outside activities if it was above 85F. Do water parks host parties?  Is there a room to rent that is air conditioned?  Can a nice finger  food meal be planned?  \n\nOP is NTA. It still might be nice to cater a bit to in laws while at the same time enhancing the event with a nice water park suite and some finger food and alcohol/wine.", ">They told me we will all be family soon and I should not be so casually telling them I do not want them there.\n\nNTA.  You'll all be family soon, so they should not be so casually telling them they don't want to go to the party you very much want.\n\nI love the idea, and if we hadn't eloped, we wanted to have our \"reception\" at a local-ish amusement park.", "NTA,youre doin it right don't ever let someone stuffy and entitled like that tell you what the F to do", "NTA. That actually sounds fun really and different.", "NTA\n\n not everything will be exactly how they want it.\n\nThat this had to be said at all just irritated me... OP are they trying to push their wants on YOUR life event anywhere else? If so that's some overstepping bs, better to put them in line now, unless you want them butting in for the rest of your marriage.", "NTA tell them that are free to have the bachelorette party they want. They you even give the sil permission to be the substitute bride for the day. You hope they have fun.\n\nThis way you and the rest can go have fun doing what you wan!\n\nElope and really watch their heads explode.\n\nBut all jokes aside stand your ground now or this will be a constant power struggle through your life.", "NTA- Since I don't drink, this sounds like fun to me. A day of goofing off and not having to worry about who the DD is going to be sounds wonderful. \n\nAfter the bridezilla's going crazy on multiple destination bachelorette parties, your's is incredibly reasonable. If sil and mil aren't into it, perhaps they can throw you a welcome to the family engagement party/dinner. Something they can pay for completely out of their pockets since they want to do it their way.", "A friend of mine is getting married this month. We\u2019re all around 21 and for her bachelorette party the bridal party went out to eat, did a fun escape room together, and then we went and played board games with her fianc\u00e9 and his groomsmen. It was a lot of fun and by no means traditional, but who cares? The bride had a good time and that\u2019s all that matters in my opinion. NTA, go have fun at your water park", "NTA\n\nI\u2019ve been to way too many boring bachelorette parties that were about booze and dancing and all the typical things one envisions. Your party sounds like the first one I\u2019d actually be excited to attend. A bachelorette should be whatever the bride-to-be wants it to be, something to have fun and cut loose with her best friends in one big shindig, \u2018cause it *is* harder to get together after getting married. I think it sounds like you and your sister made a great choice, your fianc\u00e9 agrees, and your in-laws are just butthurt traditionalists who don\u2019t like fun.", "Definitely NTA", "They're welcome to go to your party celebrating your coming new chapter of life.  They don't have to support you, but they are welcome to do so.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I don't really like water parks, but I would go if I was invited to a party at one and I wouldn't sulk about it.", "I'm so sorry for you.\nIt's hard when people are so obliviously selfish.\nThey complain non stop so you gave them an out.\nObviously you NTA.", "NTA\n\nI personally don't really like water parks or swimming very much, but I would definitely have way more fun at this kind of party than one with strippers or at an upscale restaurant.", "NTA.

Im not saying dont marry him cuz he may be perfect and his family might be the complete opposite. Just be kind agaim as remimd them they fellfree to rsvp no and no body will take any offense. But from here on out i would try my bestnot to interact with them unless you have to.", "I thought bachelorette was supposed to the bride and her friends?", "NTA.  \n\nThe water park is not an inclusive bachelorette party. So YWBTA if one of your bridesmaids was disabled in some way that made her unable to do the water park, and you made no effort to include her somehow.  Extra classy would have been to plan an inclusive bit - like breakfast first at a diner.  But it doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s the objection here.  MIL and SIL are more pissed that it\u2019s a water park at all.", "NTA - it\u2019s your bachelorette, you may do whatever you want to do.

I did ceramics and soap making class for my bachelorette party and it was a very fun time!", "   The fact that they're claiming you don't want them there concerns me. They're trying to turn you into the bad guy.\n  NTA but you better get boundaries set up before the ceremony because these 2 will gang up against you.", "NTA. Good for you for standing your ground with them. This sets an excellent precedence for the rest of your marriage; you will not be steamrolled by them. Have a fun bachelorette!", "NTA\n\nThis is a prime example of putting people in their place. Your future husband agrees with you, and that's what matter. Don't let them undermine your decisions, just enjoy your water park day! \n\n(Personally, I can't with adult people unable to comprehend other adult people have different tastes than them in entertainment, and with adult people taking themselves too seriously. I would love a waterpark bachellrette party!)", "NTA\n\nWhy would you make it quite clear you didn't want to go somewhere, and then kick up a fuss when informed you don't have to go? Entitled, opinionated, and rude.", "NTA\n\n>They told me we will all be family soon and I should not be so casually telling them I do not want them there.\n\nNext time they bring it up tell them you'll all be family soon and they should not so casually be telling you that \"you should know better\" when you're literally just throwing the party that YOU want and it's harming absolutely nobody.", "NTA", "NTA and it's great that your future husband is behind you!", "By inviting them you do want them there. \n\nBy kicking up this fuss they\u2019re telling you that an event that\u2019s 100% for you is only acceptable if it\u2019s what they want to do. \n\nWrite \u201cno\u201d next to their names on the RSVP list and don\u2019t give it another thought. \n\nBe ready for them to pull this same crap for everything. Stay above it. It\u2019s a them problem not a you problem. NTA", "NTA. To give you some support when I was getting married as a 26 yo male, I planned out a bachelor party that included paintball, Medieval Times, dinner at a nice brewery and then a casino night to polish it off.

Have a blast! Wear sunscreen!", "NTA\n\n>both of them claimed this was a childish party and not something a future bride should be doing to celebrate her engagement or wedding.\n\nThey're thinking of an engagement party, not a bachelorette party. The purpose of the bachelor or bachelorette party is to celebrate the last night one is free from the constraints of having a spouse. \n\nI think a water park is a charming idea, especially if it's what you did for your sister for hers. But as you were NTA for saying, they're welcome not to attend if they don't wish to. You might let them know that water parks are generally not all death-defying slides and there are usually \"lazy rivers\" and other features that appeal more to older adults.", "NTA! I don\u2019t know who ever dictated that a night before you say your eternal vows to someone it\u2019s perfectly okay to go to a strip club and see naked women/men and get a lap dance and get stupid drunk. It\u2019s stupid. A bachelor/bachelorette party can be whatever the hell you want it to be. It\u2019s YOUR party, YOUR wedding day. Your fianc\u00e9 seems to be okay with it and sided with you. He knows his mom and sister are being rude, entitled, and childish. If they don\u2019t like it, cool! Don\u2019t go then. I hope you have a great time at the water park! \u2764\ufe0f", "**ABSOLUTELY NTA**\n\nYour bachelorette party is a time to hang with the people who support you most and to have fun/let loose & bond *whatever that looks like*. \n\nI was a groomswoman for one of my best friends. The best man & I knew he didn\u2019t want strippers/clubbing or a quiet night at home. We ended up surprising him by taking him to a concert of someone he\u2019d been *dying* to see in Detroit, then crossing the border into Canada to go to a Casino cuz he\u2019d never been to one or across the border. We all had 2 shots when we got to the hotel, gave the groom $100 and went to have fun. He ended up using $20 to gamble (won like $35), and saved the rest for a souvenir and other things. It wasn\u2019t a crazy night, and we didn\u2019t shame him for saving most of the money. The point was to bond & have fun doing something special/novel. Mission accomplished.\n\nHis fianc\u00e9e had a sleepover with her best friends where they colored, drank wine, and watched anime for her bachelorette party.\n\nMoral of the story: you do you and have fun doing it!

My sister's bachelorette was laser tag and mine was a lake house and entirely too many board games! You make your bach whatever you want it to be!!!", "NTA.

And don\u2019t let anyone try to force you to be anyone else. \n\nI think you & your sister doing this for each other is so beautiful.\n\nAnd congratulations on your upcoming wedding :)", "NTA - but may I suggest that you offer then to let you toss you a bachelorette party themselves and they can invite their side of the family and anyone that is, well, older? I know this is not your style of party but it may mean a lot to them. Everyone has different traditions, customs, and ways to celebrate. When you get married sometime there has to be a little give and take. It can be their way to celebrate and welcome you into the family. \n\nHave two parties - one with the GFs and one, with family. \n\nCongratulations and I hope it all works out.", "NTA, and nice to see you're marrying a guy who has your back!

OP, you and your sister are awesome. NTA.\n\nIt doesn't excuse their behavior, but I wonder if they have some body issues that make a water park uncomfortable for them. Again, it doesn't really matter in this situation, but you might try looking at them with some empathy. Could you plan a special lunch or day out with them if they are uncomfortable with the bachelorette party your sister planned?", "If sister in law wants all that just tell her there will be plenty of men at the wedding that she can have a one-night stand with if she's that desperate for a male presence", "I\u2019m almost 70 and a water park sounds much better than a bar or fancy dinner to me.", "Fancy restaurant is for the rehearsal dinner.

That's for people your own age.", "Listen to your future husband.", "They can arrange dinner and strippers for their own party", "So no matter what you do, one of them will still be unhappy? This is beyond ridiculous, lol. NTA", "NTA. Enjoy your bachelorette party!", "I\u2019m like you. Neither of those is overly appealing. Neither is the water park.

It\u2019s your party.", "So by the sounds of it they don't even want the same things. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\n\nBook the McDonalds party room and send the worst strippers you can find for them.", "Same here.", "Those of that that actually like our MILs and enjoy their company?", "You don't need to conform to their ideas.
