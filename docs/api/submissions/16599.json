{"id": 16599, "submission_id": "13aj30o", "title": "AITA for telling my future MIL and SIL that nobody is forcing them to come to my bachelorette party?", "selftext": "My sister is planning my bachelorette party. We're going to a water park for the day. This is what I did for hers when I was 16 and we both had a great time. She knows I'm not really a fancy dinner kind of girl or a club girl either. So she figured, why not do what we enjoyed before. She also raised me from the age of 14 after our parents died, so she means the world to me. Invites for the party went out to the group on the list. My future MIL and SIL were like what the hell is this, this isn't a bachelorette party. They asked me why I didn't include them and why my sister handled the whole thing. I said my sister is my MOH (and only bridesmaid technically) and she wanted to do this for me. They know mine and my sister's history, they are aware that this is what I planned for hers when she was getting married. They also know I'm not a very formal kind of person or a party animal. But both of them claimed this was a childish party and not something a future bride should be doing to celebrate her engagement or wedding. They told me it might be understandable that a teenager who knows no better would arrange something like this but a grown woman in her 30s should know better. I told them they did not have to be rude and my sister was planning something I would enjoy instead of something she knows I won't have fun during.\n\nThey were complaining that they are too old, too offended and all kinds of other comments about the party. They are yet to RSVP to my sister also. So when they complained to me repeatedly I told them nobody is forcing them to come and if it is so offensive to them, RSVPing no is a valid choice and nobody will give them crap for it.\n\nThey told me we will all be family soon and I should not be so casually telling them I do not want them there. Their comment annoyed me when they had been bitching about it for a while. But maybe I am TA for this. My fiance told his mom and sister they are being crazy over the top and ridiculous and that not everything will be exactly how they want it. They told him what I said and how I am telling my future family their presence is not wanted. He shrugged them off. But I do have to ask still AITA?", "created_utc": 1683452961, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13aj30o/aita_for_telling_my_future_mil_and_sil_that/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They feel as though I told them not to come. And maybe I can see why it would come across as simply I don't want them there. It was not my intention at all. But these women are going to be in my life for a long time to come, as family, and maybe there was something I could have said better. I don't want to start drama before I'm even married and I might have done just that with them.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You don't need to conform to their ideas. Hold firm on your plans.", "NTA. My MIL would be all over a water park (SIL too). \nYou becoming part of the family means they should accept you for who you are and what your interest are. They don\u2019t have to agree. As you say they don\u2019t even need to come, but they at least have the good grace to turn you down politely.", "NTA. Simply, it\u2019s a party for you. Sounds like a fun idea honestly.", "NTA. I don't know how old is \"too old\" for a waterpark but I'm late 30s and the idea of having a bachelorette party at one is quite frankly wicked cool! Why wouldn't you go?!\n\nTbh best they don't go, nothing worse than a couple Debbie Downers when you're trying to have fun.", "NTA\n\nYou want a party, they don't like the party, they don't have to come. You're not telling them they're not welcome, they are choosing not to attend. \n\nPersonally I would just stop engaging with them in this conversation. If it's a message, thank them for their opinion then don't engage. If it's face to face, change the subject or ask them to hold that thought and you walk off. They are clearly used to getting their own way and you need to be clear you won't be bullied.", "NTA\n\nThey are incredibly rude, or they love strippers and want an excuse to go to a stripper show and act crazy. \n\nBachelorette parties are a way to have fun and feel good. A water park is huge fun, so enjoy it! Not everyone loves clubs and dancing. Do whatever makes you feel happy!!", "*I told them they did not have to be rude and my sister was planning something I would enjoy instead of something she knows I won't have fun during.*\n\nYes they are rude. You are the bride and your sister, who knows and loves you, is planning the bachelorette party for you. Your sister sounds marvelous!\n\n*So when they complained to me repeatedly I told them nobody is forcing them to come and if it is so offensive to them, RSVPing no is a valid choice and nobody will give them crap for it.*\n\nThey kept on being rude towards you, the bride, and towards your sister, who is organizing the party. Also, an invitation is not a summons. You were sport on with what you told them.\n\n*They told me we will all be family soon and I should not be so casually telling them I do not want them there.*\n\nYes you will all be family soon, and them disrespecting your wishes for your bachelorette party is offensive and not very welcoming behavior to their family. And you did not tell them not to come, they've been bitching about not liking your party and you just informed them they weren't obliged to attend an event they didn't want to be part of. You've been nicer than I would have been...\n\nEnjoy your party !\n\nNTA", "NTA, it\u2019s YOUR bachelorette party. Do whatever the hell YOU want to do! My goodness some people are so entitled! I can\u2019t imagine trying to get someone to do something they don\u2019t want to do for their bachelorette party  just so that I could enjoy it more.", "NTA. Im a grown full adult and enjoy water parks. \nIts your bachelorette party, its her choice if they wanna go or not. \nSaid nobody is forcing you its not the same that said nobody want you there. \nThat said are to old BUT thire beaviour its like a couple of brats.", "NTA, \n\nWhat a lovely idea, instead of the usual.\n\nAs you\u2019ve said there\u2019s no obligation to attend of they don\u2019t want to.\nIt\u2019s your hen do not theirs.", "NTA. No discussion here.

I am 50 and the waterpark idea sounds like so much fun! \n\nNTA and I would be sorely tempted to ask when they decided to stop enjoying life.", "NTA and let your fianc\u00e9 deal with them", "NTA the water park sounds awesome. I did an escape room and harry potter drink making where you dress up in robes! They are just boring and too consumed with what they look like to others. Your sister is great, she is making it what YOU want.", "NTA- but to be honest having two bachelorette parties is the solution. They are half right, they are going to be family and maybe dinner out might be an option. Grandma and sister in law might not like a the idea of going for a public swim for alot of reasons.

Good your sister is looking out for you still. Part of the family does not mean a pushover. Hold firm.", "NTA, its your bachelorette party and its upto to you decide how you want it. If they are unghappy, as you rightly said, they can get lost. You don't have to be forced into doing things you don't want to and who would want a MIL or SIL for such a party anyway. Its just for the brides side and its time to have fun.", "NTA. What you said was absolutely fine; the invitation indicates that you *do* want them there, and you clarified that if they don't like the type of party, they are free to decline.\n\nThey're AHs for trying to control what you do for your own party. I'm glad your fiance appears to have your back!\n\nDon't worry; you're not starting any drama. You can gracefully continue with your party, wedding, and life.", "NTA You can do whatever you want for your bachelorette. It\u2019s a party for/about you. \n\nHowever to keep the peace with everyone, you may want to have a non-bachelorette party get together with them pre-wedding. Doesn\u2019t have to involve getting drunk or partying. Afternoon tea or similar.", "NTA Thus honestly sounds like a much more fun idea than staying out until all hours of the night or worrying about getting sick or a hangover from drinking too much. It's your party and there are so many things you can do at a water park.", "Nta, this is your party, they've had (or will have) their own. They can do them. You do you. Be prepared for the permanent entitlement of criticism for anything you do in the future that they don't approve of. Find some well set phrases to shit them down on that front asap!", ">\tBut both of them claimed this was a childish party and not something a future bride should be doing to celebrate her engagement or wedding\n\nNTA, do they both know they live on Earth and every bride is DIFFERENT? Your wedding, your bachelorette party, your way! I\u2019ve heard of some Bachelorette \u201cparties\u201d where the girls simply go to dinner and that\u2019s it! There is no proper way to have a bachelorette party.  They either accept that this is you and your vibe or don\u2019t attend.", "You guys sounds so cute - and awesome, you and your sister. Lord, do NOT ever be too grown up to enjoy these simple things. \n\nHave a blast with your party.

It's yours.\n\n>My fiance told his mom and sister they are being crazy over the top and ridiculous and that not everything will be exactly how they want it.\n\nYou're marrying the right person.", "Man, I wish my bach was during warm months. A theme park and/or water park would have been FRICKIN AWESOME!!\n\nAlso, if anyone in your party is a bit wilder, guess what? Those places sell alcohol! If you have any foodies, that won't help, but most people can have a corn dog or some popcorn. Or you could pack a picnic and leave the park for a while. \n\nWaterpark is a FANTASTIC idea! MIL and SIL can get stuffed.\n\nNTA", "NTA. And I don't envy you having these people as your future in-laws.", "I am in my mid 50s and would be there like a shot it sounds like an awesome thing to do.\n\nIf you prefer pub crawls, stupid games, getting so drunk you throw up and are hung over. That is your choice. Decline and don't make a fuss.\n\nIf you prefer a fancy posh sit down meal. That is your choice.  Decline and don't make a fuss.\n\nNTA.", "Why would they expect you to want them there after bitching about everything and telling you your ideas of fun are stupid? Oh, you don't like partying or formal dinners? We do, so let's go do that for YOUR party. NTA. People are getting creative with their bachelor/bachelorette parties now and it's fantastic! We just did one for our buddy where we rode our bikes around all day doing different things and had a blast feeling like kids again haha!\n\nETA - water park sounds like a fantastic idea for a party and I hope you don't let their nonsense ruin your day!", "I\u2019m just an asshole, so I would flat out tell them that you changed your mind and you are having a \u201creal bachelorette party\u201d. Can we please do it at one of their houses. You plan to get tied up on the bed and get hang banged by as many men as possible with all the ladies cheering you on. You already have 10 men lined up. If they could help find more, that would be awesome and appreciated. \n\nMaybe the water park won\u2019t be a bad idea anymore.", "NTA Let highbrow decorum dictate their get togethers while you enjoy the hell out of your life. That's a great idea for your party, btw."]}
