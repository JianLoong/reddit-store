We're going to a water park for the day. This is what I did for hers when I was 16 and we both had a great time. She knows I'm not really a fancy dinner kind of girl or a club girl either. So she figured, why not do what we enjoyed before. She also raised me from the age of 14 after our parents died, so she means the world to me. Invites for the party went out to the group on the list. My future MIL and SIL were like what the hell is this, this isn't a bachelorette party. They asked me why I didn't include them and why my sister handled the whole thing. I said my sister is my MOH (and only bridesmaid technically) and she wanted to do this for me. They know mine and my sister's history, they are aware that this is what I planned for hers when she was getting married. They also know I'm not a very formal kind of person or a party animal. But both of them claimed this was a childish party and not something a future bride should be doing to celebrate her engagement or wedding. They told me it might be understandable that a teenager who knows no better would arrange something like this but a grown woman in her 30s should know better. I told them they did not have to be rude and my sister was planning something I would enjoy instead of something she knows I won't have fun during.\n\nThey were complaining that they are too old, too offended and all kinds of other comments about the party. They are yet to RSVP to my sister also. So when they complained to me repeatedly I told them nobody is forcing them to come and if it is so offensive to them, RSVPing no is a valid choice and nobody will give them crap for it.\n\nThey told me we will all be family soon and I should not be so casually telling them I do not want them there. Their comment annoyed me when they had been bitching about it for a while. But maybe I am TA for this. My fiance told his mom and sister they are being crazy over the top and ridiculous and that not everything will be exactly how they want it. They told him what I said and how I am telling my future family their presence is not wanted. He shrugged them off.

A theme park and/or water park would have been FRICKIN AWESOME!!\n\nAlso, if anyone in your party is a bit wilder, guess what? Those places sell alcohol!

I\u2019m sorry you lost your parents so young, and I\u2019m so glad you have such a fantastic sister. Enjoy your Bach!! \n\nNot to mention, having been to many at this point - I would way prefer a kick ass day at a water park to spending $1K in a single weekend packed with brunches and activities.

But don't forget sunscreen!", "Hey OP, \n\nYou are NTA for wanting your bachelorette party at the water park. What a fun idea! I like how you did it for your sister and now she gets to do it for you. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nFrom your post, your MIL and SIL ridiculing the idea makes them TA. Not cool at all. \n\nINFO: However, I do have a clarifying question, when you say they are older, how old are they? The last few lines of your post indicate that they want to feel included and that you saying it doesn\u2019t matter if they don\u2019t come hurt them. \n\nYou are still in the right to have your party where you wish! No doubt at all\u2026 but is it that they can\u2019t attend? Like, will they not be able to enjoy the park because they can\u2019t go down slides due to problems with their body, and (although they are being immature and not communicating clearly) do they simply want to be able to spend time with you in a less fast paced setting? They are expressing it poorly, but maybe that\u2019s why they are opposed to the idea. \n\nMy SIL had a bridal shower and a bachelorette party. The young crowd was at the part,  and the older and young crowd when to the bridal shower. Are you having a bridal shower?\n\nAgain, although they are 100% TA for the rude comments, the vibe I kind of got from your post is that they want to spend time with you, but the water park idea threw them as they thought you were having a traditional bachelorette party, and they don\u2019t think they can hack it. They sound traditional\u2026 are they?", "NTA and kudos to your fianc\u00e9 for defending you.", "NTA.  You didn't tell them you didn't want them there.  You're told them they didn't have to come if they didn't want to.  That's very different.", "NTA, first of all, MILs are not traditionally invited to bachelorette parties, so what is she even upset about? I didn\u2019t even have a bachelorette party when I got married and no one gave a shit.", "You didn't tell them they were not wanted.

We threw a friend a five year old s party for her bachelorette!  We had an Adult bouncy castle, party games (with VERY adult prizes) vodka jellies and cocktails and mini pizzas.

That would not have even occurred to me. \n\n>They told me we will all be family soon and I should not be so casually telling them I do not want them there.\n\nI don't agree with this comment or stance. Imo you form a new family with your spouse and that becomes the focus of your life while continuing with your original family. If you don't do that, you end up with well my mommy...NTA. Your sister sounds amazing!", "NTA.   Keep saying pleasantly that you are looking forward to a wonderful occasion that suits you perfectly and they are welcome to come and you won't be offended if they choose not to.\n\nPeople do all sorts of activities for such events.  It sounds like you may have very different styles from your MIL and SIL.  \n\nThis problem will come up at other times throughout your hopefully long marriage. So it might be worth saying now that you will invite them to all sorts of events in the coming years. Because you are adventurous, they may not like some of them and will probably like others.  Inviting them to something they don't like is just an indication that they are welcome to come and not a statement about anything else.", "Their presence is wanted.

Easy solution.", "So their take is that wholesome fun is not a way to start a marriage? Are they hoping for strippers, a lap dance, drunkenness or outrageously priced fancy accommodations for your bachelorette?  Your event sounds unique, personal, fun and lovely. Hope they respond No. Enjoy your party!

My sister is the worst. Just terrible thinking of me for my own bachelorette party. Who does that??? :O", "Or having the bachelorette party that she wants. And they can chose not to come.

Op, do this.", "SIL is 30 and MIL is 52 and both are very active people with no disabilities. SIL isn't so much traditional as she's into the nightclubs, strippers, etc. MIL is more traditional.

But no bridal shower or any other parties outside of the wedding planned.", "SIL wants the nightclub and the strippers. MIL wants the fancy restaurant and all the elegance. Neither of those things is something I enjoy personally lol.", "Apparently you and your rude family. Honestly though  .... waterpark sounds fun. For mine, my bestie did a joint bachelor/Bachelorette scavenger hunt through our town then a very low key dinner at a bring your own wine not fancy resto. \n\nThese events are for the people getting married so they should reflect who they are. I think you will have a nice time without them. Your sis sounds thoughtful and I hope you have a blast.", "Thanks for the clarification Op! \n\nThey have to come to terms that your bachelorette party is not going to be traditional or what they have done in the past like your husband told them. It would have simply been a difference of opinion, except they started making rude remarks and criticizing the party. All of that made them TA. \n\nIf the relationship is tense right now, a sit down conversation is in order\u2026 they owe you an apology for critiquing your party rudely, and they need to understand that you have different wants. They need to accept that and love you as you are and respect the bond you have with your sister. \n\nThey may be disappointed they don\u2019t get to experience the \u201ctraditional\u201d bachelorette party or bridal shower and celebrate you that way, but they need to accept that. You want them there, but not if they are going to complain and wreck it for others. Keep up your boundaries! \n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffdI would send your fianc\u00e9 back with all of this if they keep up their stance. They don\u2019t see that they are hurting you by holding on to traditional views on how pre-wedding events should look, especially when it has such a special sisterly significance. \n\nBest wishes with the wedding and the party Op!", "Something tells me they watch a LOT of \"Real Housewives.\"", "Forget that, its your party, you do what you enjoy, they can got for dinner or clubbing on their own special events."]}
