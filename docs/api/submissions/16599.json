We're going to a water park for the day. This is what I did for hers when I was 16 and we both had a great time. She knows I'm not really a fancy dinner kind of girl or a club girl either. So she figured, why not do what we enjoyed before. She also raised me from the age of 14 after our parents died, so she means the world to me. Invites for the party went out to the group on the list. My future MIL and SIL were like what the hell is this, this isn't a bachelorette party. They asked me why I didn't include them and why my sister handled the whole thing. I said my sister is my MOH (and only bridesmaid technically) and she wanted to do this for me. They know mine and my sister's history, they are aware that this is what I planned for hers when she was getting married. They also know I'm not a very formal kind of person or a party animal. But both of them claimed this was a childish party and not something a future bride should be doing to celebrate her engagement or wedding. They told me it might be understandable that a teenager who knows no better would arrange something like this but a grown woman in her 30s should know better. I told them they did not have to be rude and my sister was planning something I would enjoy instead of something she knows I won't have fun during.\n\nThey were complaining that they are too old, too offended and all kinds of other comments about the party. They are yet to RSVP to my sister also. So when they complained to me repeatedly I told them nobody is forcing them to come and if it is so offensive to them, RSVPing no is a valid choice and nobody will give them crap for it.\n\nThey told me we will all be family soon and I should not be so casually telling them I do not want them there. Their comment annoyed me when they had been bitching about it for a while. But maybe I am TA for this. My fiance told his mom and sister they are being crazy over the top and ridiculous and that not everything will be exactly how they want it. They told him what I said and how I am telling my future family their presence is not wanted. He shrugged them off.

Best they learn this now and fast.\n\nAlso, stop feeling bad. They literally lied about what you said in the hopes of trying to cause damage to your relationship with your husband. At no point did you say you didn't want them there. You simply heard their complaints and (kindly) told them no one will take offense if they choose to rsvp that they cannot attend.

Extra classy would have been to plan an inclusive bit - like breakfast first at a diner.  But it doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s the objection here.

We all had 2 shots when we got to the hotel, gave the groom $100 and went to have fun. He ended up using $20 to gamble (won like $35), and saved the rest for a souvenir and other things.

The best bachelorette parties I've been to have been sort of all ages activity-based like yours - sip and paints, belly dancing classes, escape rooms, bonfires, comedy clubs, etc.  Just people hanging out and having fun.

It's your deal, and you should get to do what you want.  It's ***your*** party, after all.\n\nOTOH, it does seem like a slap-in-the-face for MIL and SIL.  IDK their age, but if they're older (40+), a day at the water park would probably feel quite exclusionary.  I can certainly see how from their view it's almost like you invited them knowing they'd \"have to\" decline.\n\nI mean, your party, your deal.  I'll stick to that.\n\nWhere my ambivalence starts, though, is that if you were going to invite them, shouldn't you be somewhat, just a little bit, sensitive to their concerns?  Women's body image and public perception is a hugely complex and fraught thing.  I suspect that my fun-loving wife would have declined a trip to a waterpark at various points after her pregnancy, despite being fine with it any other time.\n\nThe issue is that it's possible for guys who don't enjoy a lap dance to still hang with the other guys at a strip club.  They can all sit together, they can have a meal (lol), they can drink, they can smoke, they can laugh.  IDK what a pair of older women do at a waterpark if they're electing not to go in swimsuits.  Is there a place where they can hang and eat and drink and relax?  IDK.\n\nI guess what I mean to say is that if this were a private party, hosted by your sister, and only a few, younger folks were invited, that'd be one thing.  In a way, it'd almost be easier if you just didn't call it the \"bachelorette party\", and just did a waterpark trip.\n\nBut, calling it that, and then inviting your SIL and MIL, the latter of whom must be in her 50s if not 60s (you said you were in your 30s, so MIL must be at least that old, and probably older, if SIL is ***also*** claiming to be \"too old\"), seems a bit odd.  It's like having a \"bachelor party\", inviting my 60yo father-in-law, to a combo rock-climbing/hang-gliding trip.  What's he supposed to think--especially if he's using a walker already?\n\nThere's nothing wrong with your party.  There's nothing wrong with doing what you want.  But when you put that label on it (turning it into a wedding-adjacent event), and then inviting who you invited, it doesn't seem out of the question that they'd expect it to be inclusive of them, as your invitees.\n\nYet, at the same time, whatever their perceptions are of you or your \"social graces\", they should show some damn class and just politely decline.\n\nFinal answer: ESH.", "NTA - Might as well join us over at r/justnomil now because these two are going to get on your last nerves.

IDK why MIL declined (SIL is 30, so she's just being a snot) but it's not impossible to imagine--with a bit of empathy after you put down the liberal anti-family Reddit pitchforks--that a 50yo might not feel comfortable or able to participate.\n\nOP would have been better off just having a waterpark thing with younger women, and not naming it what she did and not inviting the MIL.

And, because you like to jump and your kid likes to jump, it's held at a trampoline park.  At the same time, you invited the kids in the class who are wheelchair bound, and another kid who recently broke his leg.\n\nEveryone is entitled to do what they want, but by calling it what she did, and then inviting who she invited, that those actions create some expectations.\n\nBecause as it turns out, sometimes being whimsical and capricious actually makes you the asshole; it's not always \"cool\".", "Please can you got to a water park for every birthday, anniversary & celebration from now to eternity.

Somehow, those guests are entitled to expect to be able to participate.  If you invite a wheelchair-bound kid to a trampoline park, you better make some arrangements for your kid to spend time with the wheelchair kid, and make sure that there are things he can do, and also that he's able to eat with everyone and whatnot.\n\nAlso, I'm not entire clear about the way OP is painting the interaction.  If SIL/MIL talked with her privately, that doesn't smell like a \"fuss\" to me.  That just smells like people saying: \"Hey, we feel sorta left out of this, and does it have to be this way?\"  I mean, maybe not, but IDK; there isn't enough info for that.\n\nAnd if it was so easy to dismiss their concerns with a: \"Fine, don't come,\" that in itself has problems.  Why did you invite them, then, if you were so uninterested in their attendance?  And, that's not a particularly graceful way to handle it.  OP could have said:\n\n> *\"I see something about this upsets you; I'm not going to change my plans--this is a wonderful gift from my sister, and that's not changing; I'd love to have you there, but if you're uncomfortable, I can certainly understand.  That said, is there something we do--perhaps in addition to my sister's wonderful party--that I could invite you to, where you feel you'd be more included?  I'd hate for you to feel left out of a wedding-related event.\"*\n\nBecause, let's face, no one is handling anything with any grace in this situation.", "I know if I got invited to this type of bachelorette party I'd be stoked!", "Yes!
