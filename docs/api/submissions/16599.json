We're going to a water park for the day. This is what I did for hers when I was 16 and we both had a great time. She knows I'm not really a fancy dinner kind of girl or a club girl either. So she figured, why not do what we enjoyed before. She also raised me from the age of 14 after our parents died, so she means the world to me. Invites for the party went out to the group on the list. My future MIL and SIL were like what the hell is this, this isn't a bachelorette party. They asked me why I didn't include them and why my sister handled the whole thing. I said my sister is my MOH (and only bridesmaid technically) and she wanted to do this for me. They know mine and my sister's history, they are aware that this is what I planned for hers when she was getting married. They also know I'm not a very formal kind of person or a party animal. But both of them claimed this was a childish party and not something a future bride should be doing to celebrate her engagement or wedding. They told me it might be understandable that a teenager who knows no better would arrange something like this but a grown woman in her 30s should know better. I told them they did not have to be rude and my sister was planning something I would enjoy instead of something she knows I won't have fun during.\n\nThey were complaining that they are too old, too offended and all kinds of other comments about the party. They are yet to RSVP to my sister also. So when they complained to me repeatedly I told them nobody is forcing them to come and if it is so offensive to them, RSVPing no is a valid choice and nobody will give them crap for it.\n\nThey told me we will all be family soon and I should not be so casually telling them I do not want them there. Their comment annoyed me when they had been bitching about it for a while. But maybe I am TA for this. My fiance told his mom and sister they are being crazy over the top and ridiculous and that not everything will be exactly how they want it. They told him what I said and how I am telling my future family their presence is not wanted. He shrugged them off.

At no point did you say you didn't want them there. You simply heard their complaints and (kindly) told them no one will take offense if they choose to rsvp that they cannot attend.

The best bachelorette parties I've been to have been sort of all ages activity-based like yours - sip and paints, belly dancing classes, escape rooms, bonfires, comedy clubs, etc.  Just people hanging out and having fun.

If you'd had the nightclub and the strippers, they'd be all over you for being a terrible fiancee and what kind of person in their 30s goes *clubbing* with *strippers?* Why can't you do something wholesome, like a day at the water park? \n\nThey're showing you what you'll be dealing with for the rest of your life. They have too much time on their hands and they're going to waste it being in your business. Your fiancee thinks they're being ridiculous, and he has your back. Have fun at the park.", "Where exactly are they saying that you told them you didn\u2019t want them there? I don\u2019t see it. \n\nIt sounds like they enjoy complaining for the sake of it and want you to listen repeatedly while they do. NTA", "I'm probably older than either of them. Your \"party\" sounds better to me than the usual bachelor/bachelorette party. It's your day, and what you want. NTA", "You are NTA.  I think it\u2019s very sweet of your sister to plan a party that *you* would like.  Your SIL and MIL can go or not, but they don\u2019t have to give commentary.  Hopefully you can continue to express that their not being there does not leave them out.  A water park is not for everyone\u2014 but it is for you.", "NTA - We did trampolining for my hen do (British bachelorette) - it was brilliant! Trampolining, then pizza and prosecco at home then a tiki bar. Cost everyone about \u00a350 in total. 10/10 would do again and I\u2019m 28!", "I'm 44 and this sounds fun as hell.", "NTA.  Your idea is fire! Dont take the complaints from the debbie downers personally.", "OP, set your boundaries HARD with these two. They are going to push and push and push at everything you do.\n\n\"No\" doesn't need an explanation.\n\nAnd remember that you are under no obligation to maintain communication with your partner's family. If they get too obnoxious, remember that.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You never expressed they were neither invited nor wanted. You only informed them they weren\u2019t obliged to attend. Major difference. I feel you worded it well and they\u2019re now just trying to manipulate the situation to get what they want. They\u2019re just interested in enjoying themselves without concern for your enjoyment\u2026 on a day meant for you. (Think of it in terms of your birthday. You only like chocolate cake and they\u2019re insisting on you serving vanilla and carrot cakes. Your birthday, your cake!)\nSounds like your fianc\u00e9e has your back, as he should. Don\u2019t concern yourself with their poor and selfish behavior. Enjoy your day in your way with your awesome sister!", "NTA sounds like the bachelorette party of my dreams, ignore your in-laws, they suck.", "NTA. And I\u2019m so glad your fianc\u00e9 is supporting you on this", "NTA, how can I RSVP? In all honesty, this sounds like a much better bachelorette party then some stuffy formal get together, and you'll have a ton of fun without MIL and SIL to ruin your day", "NTA - they don\u2019t have to go, and you told them you wouldn\u2019t hold it against them.  They are TAs for trying to make a big thing out of nothing.", "NTA", "NTA. I love this idea. I\u2019m 46 and if I ever get married, that is what I want to do! The bachelorette is for YOU. I\u2019m kind of surprised his mother would even want to go especially if you were going clubbing. That\u2019s weird.", "NTA. I love how they complained and complained about not wanting to go to the Waterpark, you told them they didn't have to go to the Waterpark, and then they complained and complained about not being able to go to the Waterpark. Make up your f*cling minds!", "NTA and that sounds rad AF. \nSide note I\u2019ve seen Bach parties where they just go tubing all day and have a house party afterwards. \nYour in laws can screw all the way off \ud83e\udd70 they sound like they wanted free fancy food", "NTA. The gall of them complaining about how you are treating them when, in reality, they are ignoring what you want and demanding you change your plans to suit their interests. How selfish and entitled of them.", "NTA\n\nI HATE professional victims", "It's not your problem that they dislike the venue for your party.  It works for your sister and for you and I'm assuming your friends.  Who made the rule that a future MIL and SIL have any say whatsoever in a bachelorette party plan?  They're lucky you invited them.  None of my in-laws came to my bachelor party and none of my family went to my late wifes bachelorette party.  Just smile sweetly and tell them you're assuming they will be RSVP'ing NO and move on.  Enjoy your day, it sounds fun...", "NTA. This isn\u2019t a party for THEM. Have fun at the water park!! I\u2019m jealous.", "NTA - and your response to them should be \u201cYou\u2019re right. We are all going to be family soon, and if you think my response is rude, I guess that means I will fit in perfectly as both of you have been extremely rude to me through this entire situation. My bachelorette party is something I will enjoy. I really don\u2019t care if you think it is childish, it is something I will enjoy, and that is the entire point. If you don\u2019t wish to attend, no one is going to force you, but I\u2019m not going to listen to you complain about it either\u201d", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou can tell when two or more people have sat in a circle winding each other up when their tyrade of bs eventually spills over onto the target and sounds the same while spoken separately. This seriously sounds like they cooked up every possible complaint they could muster. \n\nAlso, bachelorettes take all shapes. Sometimes it's a chill evening with something the bride enjoys, sometimes it's a barhopping escapade involving strippers and actions that'll get the bride dumped at the altar when the groom finds out. There really is no actual definition. Going to a waterpark sounds like a fun day in the sun, and less likely to leave you pie eyed on your big day.\n\nIf your SIL and MIL are too old to find fun in such simple frivolity they've got other problems, and to be frank it sounds like they're \"too old\" for a water park, but suggesting they're not too old for the strippers, which should be beneath them by this point in the ever fluctuating arbitrary nature of what \"maturity\" constitutes.", "NTA and so glad he has your back.", "NTA- that actually sounds like a fun party. It should be something you enjoy. If they don't enjoy it, they don't have to come. I don't think it's wrong that you told them that. It's not like you said \"we planned this deliberately so you wouldn't come!\". Sheesh.", "NTA. I love how they're putting words in your mouth. You never once said you didn't want them there. You said its cool if they RSVP no. Those are two totally separate things. They just want it to be about them and want you to conform. Do you baby girl and have fun at the bachelorette your amazing sister knew you would enjoy. \n\nGlad that your guy is standing by you. Hopefully he can handle all of the extra family coming at you for no reason.", "NTA. The water park sounds like an amazing bachelorette party!! When my sister married her husband, they were not into the clubbing/fancy dinner scene either. We did a coed bachelor/bachelorette laser tag then went to an old-school arcade. We were all in our late 20\u2019s/early 30\u2019s and it was awesome!", "You are NTA. They are rude and entitled.", "You are NTA. They are rude and entitled.", "I think you made a great choice and sounds so fun. My husband and I are older parents. We rented out a water park for my daughters first. And the over 40 adults had more fun than the kids. I have pics and fond memories of My 47 year old husband going down the water slide with his friends \ud83d\ude02\nIt\u2019s not their bachelorette party so they can come\nor not. That simple.", "Wait...How exactly are you telling them you do not want them there? THEY said they think going to a water park is childish which essentially means they won't be going. As you said, they should decline the invitation if it is not something they want to do. \n\nThank goodness your fiance stood up for you! WAY TO GO!! You two are starting off your marriage with shiny, rock solid spines!! You are most definitely NTA. Have a blast at the water park!", "NTA and I\u2019m stealing this idea!", "NTA all the way. A bachelor/bachelorette party is supposed to be what the groom/bride enjoys. Something special just for them. I would personally enjoy a fine dining experience, but I don't think it's what I'd want to do for my future bachelor party - and I would be miserable in a \"night club and strippers\" setting. A water park sounds like something very personal and special for both you and your sister, and that's what matters. It may not be your SIL and MIL's idea of a good time, but *it's not about them*.", "Right? Also, I pity the fool who is \"too old\" to enjoy a water park. My mom is 81 and will still park her butt in a lazy river with a sneaky sippy cup of wine.", "These in-laws sound like boring pervs.", "Right!? Like what MIL goes to the Bachelorette party? This is supposed to be the brides last big party with her best friends before she gets married. It's not a you invite all the women from the grooms side kind of a thing.", "How is OP being made to spend money on a party she doesn't want and won't enjoy \"the solution\"?", "What is that with this family thing ? It\u2019s op bachelorette it\u2019s for her and her only. If they don\u2019t like the event they stay home. If I\u2019m having a birthday party I\u2019m not organizing two of my family members don\u2019t like my plans . Home is an option", "I would like to sit next to your mom please!", "Wait you burn when you hang out the washing like you mean it hurts? Just for context when can I expect this pain to commence?", "Definitely NTA. The party is about you, not them. My bachelorette party was sitting with my friends, talking & eating stuffed french toast at IHOP until 1am! We had fun, just like you will at yours. Enjoy yourself, forget about what they want!!!", "Water park sounds like a great bachelorette party. I did roller coasters for my bachelor party and it was great. Have fun! NTA", "Tell your SIL she can celebrate your engagement/wedding at the nightclub alone with strippers and tell your MIL she can take herself out for dinner. You'll be doing what you want at the water park.", "NTA It\u2019s not that YOU don\u2019t want them there, they shouldn\u2019t put those words in your mouth. The party is planned they can come if THEY want to or not. It\u2019s their choice, not you pushing them out.", "NTA Tell them that they can now plan and pay for a bachelorette party for you that's more to their liking then, and in the meantime you'll be telling your sister that they aren't attending the one that you actually want.", "Not only are your closest people on your side (sister and Fiance) but the MIL and SIL are being dishonest about what you said to them.", "I'm confused as to why they think what they want to do matters at all when it comes to someone else's bachelorette party. Having your in-laws there in the first place is uncommon I feel. I don't know anyone who's done that, although I'm sure it happens.\n\nIf they really don't like the plans that's fine, they don't have to go. They don't get to change the plans of a party that's celebrating another person to their own preferences. That's a really strange and self-absorbed mindset to have.\n\nI can only imagine how your fianc\u00e9's and FIL's birthdays were like in that household. NTA.", "Maybe you could find a compromise, how about you take some strippers to the water park? /S", "MIL is welcome to invite you to a fancy dinner.  They sound terrible. I\u2019m sorry. This sounds like a good way to set the boundary early that you won\u2019t be going by their plans.", "Tbh just go with the sister and fiance and have a blast and if they're mad let them be mad and honestly OP please understand that if they do this to you they might try it later on to your kids (if you plan to have any) please consider going LC or NC after you get married because they have red flags all over them.", "I think you and your sister made a great choice, your fiance agrees, and your in-laws are just butthurt traditionalists who don't like fun.", "[removed]", "NTA. I think the water park is an awesome idea! You don't need to conform to their ideas. Hold firm on your plans.", "It sounds like they'd fit in with those whining women just perfectly...", "It's weird if you're looking at strippers, it's not weird at a water park.", "That sounds like such a fun plan!", "> Now me I would love to do a scavenger hunt adventure\n\na friend celebrated her teenage birthday this way (nearly 50 years ago!) and istg i still look back on it remembering how much fun it was. we all traipsed all over her neighborhood knocking on doors asking people to provide us with what was on the list.\n\ni won the hunt btw. most incredible part was that one of the things on the list was 'diamond' and while most of my friends got either a 'diamond' from a deck of cards, or a picture of a diamond from a magazine, the woman whose door i knocked on handed over her actual diamond ring to me, a stranger. now, she was friends with the birthday girl's family, but imagine handing over your engagement ring to some teenage girl you've never seen before.\n\nbut such was life in a small town way back then.", "The best answer", "My husband just did that this afternoon. I'm not in the US but rafting, paintball or karting is kinda \"traditional\" on what to expect from a bachelor(ette) party", "They're totally picturing one of those produced, arranged, fake-as-hell, nights out they're always doing on the shows.", "NTA. Simply, it\u2019s a party for you. Sounds like a fun idea honestly."]}
