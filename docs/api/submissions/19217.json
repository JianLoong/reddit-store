{"id": 19217, "submission_id": "143g5ex", "title": "AITA for expecting colleagues to be okay with sharing the costs of work-related carpooling?", "selftext": "I recently learned about this subreddit, and following events today decided to finally use my account. I work as a PhD students and am in the minority as a car owner. Last week I let a trio of colleagues convince me to attend a PhD defence this week for which we were all invited, since they wanted to carpool knowing public transport is terrible in this area, and immediately offered to split the costs. No big deal, I was on the fence about going anyway and both the carpooling and cost splitting has happened regularly in the past.\n\nMonday I ended up driving approximately 3 hours, for a total of some 200 km, shuttling combinations of 5 colleagues 1) to the defence, 2) back to work, 3) to the dinner party, and 4) back to the town where we work and live. Yesterday I checked whether some of these colleagues were okay with me dumping the complete cost calculations in an email to the people involved, which they affirmed. About an hour later one of them (not the trio) who later asked to ride along for ride 2 came find me during my lunch break, ardently arguing that it is wrong for me to expect compensation from friends since I was going there anyway, and that she will not pay for the costs as a matter of principle that has nothing to do with the money. Surprised, I told her pretty much what I wrote here, that driving costs time and money that is compensated virtually anywhere else. While giving my opinion on the situation and defending the offer of others to split the costs and why that makes sense to me, at no point did I tell or even ask her to pay me.\n\nAs suggested, shortly afterwards I sent an email with the cost breakdown to my passengers. I wrote, quote:\n\n\"Since multiple people were gallant enough to offer splitting the costs when they asked to carpool, here is an overview assuming I correctly remember who was sitting behind me:\n\n\\[names and numbers\\]\n\nI do not need all of everyone's spare change, so if you feel it's fair to pay me back you can round these numbers to your advantage.\n\n\\[the calculations I used, for transparency\\]\".\n\nSo far at least 3 other colleagues have approached me to comply, one getting me to share my bank details with the whole group, but to my surprise I also had the one who refused walk into my office. With a paper cup. Not knowing what to expect but hoping she no longer considers my belief cost sharing inherently wrong, I received a \"thanks for the ride\", a smile somewhere between forced and smug, and the cup full of the smallest change she could find (1-5 cents). I just gave her a confused look as she marched out. Curious whether she'd been spiteful enough to actually take the time to count it out, I found the exact amount I'd calculated -- equivalent to $1,64 out of the total costs of 30.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for carpooling with colleagues, agreeing with the offer of their majority to share the costs, and expecting the whole group to consider this a reasonable request?

When doing my master's I didn't have a car and every night returned home with rides, and then I'd pay the parking fee, which was much less than a taxi drive.

I missed that it was $30 over all, was just stuck on the idea of a cup of change exactly the amount.\n\nI suppose if it evened out just asking everyone to chip in a $2 for the total (if 1.62 was the lowest on the list) might have been more fair in a less cringy way if you wanted the total paid? \n\nI've given a friend a fiver for a lift to a thing she would've gone herself anyway. \n\nBut showing the exact amounts here is pretty cool for transparency since they all agreed to pay him, i guess rounding should've maybe happened?", "In my opinion, this would be a somewhat rude and entitled email to send to someone who has not explicitly agreed to split the cost of transportation.

The group that car pooled and agreed to share the car expenses for the trip, let someone tag along for a short piece between a defence and the conference, I mean that's cheap to invoice them. You invoice the large group. If I car pool on a trip with 3 friends, and we give someone a ride to the beach during the weekend, I don't bill that friend for the ride to the beach. It's just cheap. YTA", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI mean her rationale makes no sense. Can you get me a coffee? You are getting one anyway. Can you also make me an appointment? You\u2019re making one anyway. Can you also write this email for me? You\u2019re writing one anyway. That\u2019s pretty much how every conversation I\u2019d have with this person moving forward would be. \n\nShe\u2019s burnt her bridge because even if someone else is the driver in the future, they will know she won\u2019t pay. She better get good walking shoes. \n\nIn the future get money up front for gas and then reconcile after true costs.", "NTA, but I would make it known that you're never going to offer again. It's not worth the harassment of even one of the riders.", "She owed you less than 2 dollars? I'd have waived that one in the group email.", "This thread is hilarious. A dollar-fucking-sixty-four. I don't know if it's a class thing but it's just unfathomably petty to me. It's not about the cost at all - it's the fact that he  completely fumbled the social cues of the situation and now looks cheap and just... Weird.", "I would also consider sharing the story of her pettiness with the other colleagues who you drove to the defense", "Her added weight increased fuel consumption and wear and tear. That ought please her. \ud83d\ude02\n\nI have to ask, you billed these people for 1,64 each? Sounds sort of \u201cspectrum-ish\u201d to me who is ND like a rainbow \ud83c\udf08.", "It\u2019s so awkward \ud83d\ude05", "Less than 2 dollars to be driven to the conference and everywhere else they needed to be, she's an insufferable rat. \n\nIf she didn't want to pay 1.64 maybe she should have spent 3 hours driving.", "You need to reread the post. OP didn't drive her for 3 hours. The person in question only tagged along for the second ride back to work. Shes not in on the group that actually agreed to repay OP for driving them there. That's why she very rightfully feels like she's being nickled and dimed.\n\nIt was totally unnecessary to have charged her for one ride, even more socially inept to charge her... $1.64.", "She's the a**", "Oh this is classic malicious compliance. NTA though; PhD students need every dollar they can get", "NTA. Carpooling makes it convenient for others. You were helpful by taking up your time, your gas, your money. \nI'd rather throw in gas money for carpool. She probably owed you less than what she would have spent if she took public transportation.", "NTA but I\u2019d let everyone else know what she did. I\u2019d also make sure she doesn\u2019t ride again.", "I don't understand why there is a question because of course you contribute for carpooling.", "NTA these kind of things teaches you about the people around you, and whether or not your values align. Note the people who made it easy and didn't give you another job with reimbursement. These are your people and the ones to include in the future. The girl who went out of her way to repay your kindness with contempt doesn't ever need to be in your car again. You didn't add your time, responsibility and effort. Just costs so you weren't out of pocket. My friends and I cover costs of fuel for road trips etc or if one person drives a short trip, the other pays for parking or shouts coffee etc. It's called looking out for eachother, so no one is out of pocket.", "NTA everyone should have kicked in a little money since you were kind enough to drive them all around and use your gas.\n\nThe one who gave you change just cost herself any chance of getting a ride with you in the future.  Do not allow her in your car again.", "NTA. And that would be the last time I did anything for her.", "You 'wouldn't accept' being charged less than $2 for the convenience of someone helping you out? lol.", "To me she's the bigger A because she made a bigger deal out of it. Like she threw a tantrum over being asked to pay less than $2 because someone was kind and helped her out.", "I wouldn't accept charging such an amount. Would feel ridiculous. Cringe.", "Except being direct isn\u2019t being impolite. There is nothing wrong with saying \u2018I spent x driving us to the conference, everyone owes me y\u2019. That\u2019s in no way impolite. I\u2019m so confused by your comments", "I think what\u2019s actually missing is it\u2019s not clear if the OP got agreement to split costs from ALL folks or just the three who convinced him to go. If he didn\u2019t tell the other two ahead of time that there was a cost for the rides then it\u2019s not really right to demand payment. But I\u2019m not 100% sure if that\u2019s what happened", "NTA. The entitlement is strong with this one.", "Info: You just calculated your insanely precise amounts based on gas used, right? You didn't try to get your time compensated, right? Some of your phrasing made me wonder.", "The thing is: it's your money then you can do whatever you want, charge, don't charge, is on you. But this is OP's money and you are not entitled to tell him he should or should not charge others.", "Imo, it would be impolite to be so direct to a person who was not aware that they would be expected to pay for something that is often given for free.", "OP also uses km and not miles."]}
