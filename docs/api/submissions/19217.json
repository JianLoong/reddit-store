{"id": 19217, "submission_id": "143g5ex", "title": "AITA for expecting colleagues to be okay with sharing the costs of work-related carpooling?", "selftext": "I recently learned about this subreddit, and following events today decided to finally use my account. I work as a PhD students and am in the minority as a car owner. Last week I let a trio of colleagues convince me to attend a PhD defence this week for which we were all invited, since they wanted to carpool knowing public transport is terrible in this area, and immediately offered to split the costs. No big deal, I was on the fence about going anyway and both the carpooling and cost splitting has happened regularly in the past.\n\nMonday I ended up driving approximately 3 hours, for a total of some 200 km, shuttling combinations of 5 colleagues 1) to the defence, 2) back to work, 3) to the dinner party, and 4) back to the town where we work and live. Yesterday I checked whether some of these colleagues were okay with me dumping the complete cost calculations in an email to the people involved, which they affirmed. About an hour later one of them (not the trio) who later asked to ride along for ride 2 came find me during my lunch break, ardently arguing that it is wrong for me to expect compensation from friends since I was going there anyway, and that she will not pay for the costs as a matter of principle that has nothing to do with the money. Surprised, I told her pretty much what I wrote here, that driving costs time and money that is compensated virtually anywhere else. While giving my opinion on the situation and defending the offer of others to split the costs and why that makes sense to me, at no point did I tell or even ask her to pay me.\n\nAs suggested, shortly afterwards I sent an email with the cost breakdown to my passengers. I wrote, quote:\n\n\"Since multiple people were gallant enough to offer splitting the costs when they asked to carpool, here is an overview assuming I correctly remember who was sitting behind me:\n\n\\[names and numbers\\]\n\nI do not need all of everyone's spare change, so if you feel it's fair to pay me back you can round these numbers to your advantage.\n\n\\[the calculations I used, for transparency\\]\".\n\nSo far at least 3 other colleagues have approached me to comply, one getting me to share my bank details with the whole group, but to my surprise I also had the one who refused walk into my office. With a paper cup. Not knowing what to expect but hoping she no longer considers my belief cost sharing inherently wrong, I received a \"thanks for the ride\", a smile somewhere between forced and smug, and the cup full of the smallest change she could find (1-5 cents). I just gave her a confused look as she marched out. Curious whether she'd been spiteful enough to actually take the time to count it out, I found the exact amount I'd calculated -- equivalent to $1,64 out of the total costs of 30.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for carpooling with colleagues, agreeing with the offer of their majority to share the costs, and expecting the whole group to consider this a reasonable request? I might have to find and monitor the malicious compliance reddit too, now...", "created_utc": 1686151382, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/143g5ex/aita_for_expecting_colleagues_to_be_okay_with/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You did nothing wrong. The colleague with the cup of change is absolutely the asshole. Don't ever give her a ride again.\n\nHowever, next time consider phrasing your email a bit differently.

Hell no.  \n\n\nWhat I taught my kids is that you pay for more than your share because the driver is covering the cost of maintenance and doing the work of driving.

You weren't even sure you were going until they approached you about going together. You went, and it helped them more than it helped you.

Never drive those a h again.  Even if they offer to pay. As a matter of principle, not money.", "She owed you less than 2 dollars? I'd have waived that one in the group email. It's borderline ridiculous to charge that. I wouldn't accept it.", "NTA. You provided a service to them and you were beyond accommodating, more so than even need be. It\u2019s straight up called being a good human and paying your part, they don\u2019t get to just expect a free ride.", "NTA - under no circumstances let her in your car anymore.  Even if you are \"going there\"", "To those saying I should've waived costs, I felt it was not up to me to decide on a cutoff. I gave everyone all the information and expected at least the major contributors to share some of only the monetary part of the costs which was their idea (up to 10 bucks for one of them), while letting others decide for themselves whether it's fair to pay a small amount. They can throw some change my way as long as it's not in unreasonably small coins, and I'm fine them rounding it down to 0 - again within reason.

Split among six people (including yourself, since you said you'd be driving to these places anyway with or without your colleagues) that's $5 a person. You were invoicing people for $5?

I went on a trip with a friend, and we used her car.  I paid for gas for the entire trip.

Helped an old lady cross the street? Charge her. Gave a tip on Excel for a coworker? Charge them. If somebody   in a restaurant consumes 5$ more than everyone, let them pay, do not ever suggest to split the table equally.

I have a coworker who doesn't own a car. She takes the bus to work when she's scheduled on weekdays but our local bus system only runs like twice a day on Sundays, so whenever she's scheduled on a Sunday I give her a ride home. I live about 5 minutes from work and she lives about 20 minutes in the other direction so it's kind of out of my way, but whatever. It's not like it's every day, it's not a huge deal. I've never once asked her for gas money, but she's given me brownies her daughter baked a couple of times as thanks lol Who has the time or energy to be pressed about $1.64?", "Exactly. When doing my master's I didn't have a car and every night returned home with rides, and then I'd pay the parking fee, which was much less than a taxi drive. Honestly it never occurred to anyone (and we were doing an MBA) to calculate gas prices versus parking fee. It was just a nice gesture from both sides."]}
