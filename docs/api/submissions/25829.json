English is not my native language, so I apologize for any mistakes.\r  \n\r  \nHere we go, I really need to get this off my chest. My name is Liz, I'm 26 years old. I've been openly lesbian since I was 15. I have an older sister named Kim, who is 29. I'm married to Kelly, 28, who is simply the most amazing woman I've ever met. Both of us really wanted to have children, and Kelly really wished to experience childbirth. So, we decided to find a sperm donor and Kelly became pregnant. The whole family was incredibly happy with the news and congratulated us on the new baby.\r  \n\r  \nNow, Kim has always been my support. She went with me to LGBT parades, stood up to anyone who judged me or my wife, and was the maid of honor at my wedding. But recently, she started a relationship with a guy named Simon. He's an extremely conservative Christian and clearly got into my sister's head. The two of them made uncomfortable jokes throughout the pregnancy, implying that Kelly had \"turned straight\" and had cheated on me with a man to have a \"real\" family. Needless to say, these comments hurt us deeply, even more coming from my sister. They got engaged and got married in the meantime. I was the maid of honor, but Kim didn't want Kelly to attend and only allowed her to go because our parents and siblings threatened not to go if she didn't.\r  \n\r  \nWhen Kelly was 7 months pregnant, she had a car accident that resulted in the loss of the baby and nearly took her life. Saying that we were devastated is an understatement. She and I sank into depression, and Kelly even came close to overdosing on medication. She barely survived. My family was our anchor. My older brother, John (32), moved to my house to help us, me and my wife, during this difficult time.\r  \n\r  \nBut you know what Kim and her husband did? Simon had the audacity to say that losing the baby was a \"blessing\" for the child, because then she wouldn't have been born into a \"dysfunctional\" family and wouldn't be raised by a couple driven by \"lust\" instead of the \"true love\" God had planned. And Kim? Well, she defended him and even added that it really was God's will that the child wouldn't be born without a father. I was extremely furious and cut contact with him.\r  \n\r  \nA few days ago, I learned that Kim had caught Simon in bed with another woman, apparently her best friend; he admitted to the affair and fled to another city to live with his lover. During this mess, Kim was pregnant, but the stress led her to miscarry. The most astonishing thing is that she didn't even know about the pregnancy until the tragedy happened. When she called me crying and shared the news, I coldly replied that it really was God's will for the child not to be born without a father.\r  \n\r  \nNow, our family is divided. Some believe Kim got what she deserved, while others think I overreacted and that she's going through a difficult time. So I want the opinion of you internet strangers: AITA?", "created_utc": 1693357476, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1650eqo/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_the_loss_of_her/", "score": 3076, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Idk I guess my instinct is to help and support someone who comes to me in need. Not shove things back in their face at that time.  I don\u2019t think what the sister did and said was right but I don\u2019t think the same thing being said is ok either. So my judgment ESH", "Technically ESH since this is \u201cam I the asshole\u201d not \u201cwas I justified\u201d. Both comments were awful, yours was a hell of clapback and relatively deserved.

English is not my native language, so I apologize for any mistakes.\r  \n\r  \nHere we go, I really need to get this off my chest. My name is Liz, I'm 26 years old. I've been openly lesbian since I was 15. I have an older sister named Kim, who is 29. I'm married to Kelly, 28, who is simply the most amazing woman I've ever met. Both of us really wanted to have children, and Kelly really wished to experience childbirth. So, we decided to find a sperm donor and Kelly became pregnant. The whole family was incredibly happy with the news and congratulated us on the new baby.\r  \n\r  \nNow, Kim has always been my support. She went with me to LGBT parades, stood up to anyone who judged me or my wife, and was the maid of honor at my wedding. But recently, she started a relationship with a guy named Simon. He's an extremely conservative Christian and clearly got into my sister's head. The two of them made uncomfortable jokes throughout the pregnancy, implying that Kelly had \"turned straight\" and had cheated on me with a man to have a \"real\" family. Needless to say, these comments hurt us deeply, even more coming from my sister. They got engaged and got married in the meantime. I was the maid of honor, but Kim didn't want Kelly to attend and only allowed her to go because our parents and siblings threatened not to go if she didn't.\r  \n\r  \nWhen Kelly was 7 months pregnant, she had a car accident that resulted in the loss of the baby and nearly took her life. Saying that we were devastated is an understatement. She and I sank into depression, and Kelly even came close to overdosing on medication. She barely survived. My family was our anchor. My older brother, John (32), moved to my house to help us, me and my wife, during this difficult time.\r  \n\r  \nBut you know what Kim and her husband did? Simon had the audacity to say that losing the baby was a \"blessing\" for the child, because then she wouldn't have been born into a \"dysfunctional\" family and wouldn't be raised by a couple driven by \"lust\" instead of the \"true love\" God had planned. And Kim? Well, she defended him and even added that it really was God's will that the child wouldn't be born without a father. I was extremely furious and cut contact with him.\r  \n\r  \nA few days ago, I learned that Kim had caught Simon in bed with another woman, apparently her best friend; he admitted to the affair and fled to another city to live with his lover. During this mess, Kim was pregnant, but the stress led her to miscarry. The most astonishing thing is that she didn't even know about the pregnancy until the tragedy happened. When she called me crying and shared the news, I coldly replied that it really was God's will for the child not to be born without a father.\r  \n\r  \nNow, our family is divided. Some believe Kim got what she deserved, while others think I overreacted and that she's going through a difficult time.

Studies have shown that women who use\u00a0water immersion\u00a0during the early phase of labor need less epidural anesthesia than those who don't.\n\n\nIs a Hot Bath Safe During Pregnancy?\n\nHot baths are not safe during pregnancy. The main concern with taking a hot bath while you're pregnant is the risk of raising your body temperature. Staying in a\u00a0hot tub\u00a0or bath for more than 10 minutes can raise your body temperature higher than 101 degrees Fahrenheit. Some research has shown that babies born to women who had fevers early in pregnancy have a higher risk of serious abnormalities of the brain and spinal cord. Further evidence is needed, but there are also some studies that suggest a fever during pregnancy may cause miscarriage. \u00a0\n\n\nhttps://www.hopkinsallchildrens.org/Patients-Families/Health-Library/HealthDocNew/Can-I-Take-Long,-Hot-Showers-While-I-m-Pregnant\n\nAs relaxing as long, steamy showers or a soak in a hot tub can be when your body is feeling the aches and pains of pregnancy, it's best to avoid becoming overheated. Raising your body temperature above 102\u00b0F (38.9\u00b0C) increases the risk for birth defects (such as neural tube defects) in the first trimester and dehydration later in the pregnancy.\n\nSo try to\u00a0limit activities that could raise your core temperature too much, including:\n\nusing saunas or hot tubs\n\ntaking very hot, long baths or showers\n\nbecoming overheated when outside in hot weather or when exercising\n\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/spina-bifida/symptoms-causes/syc-20377860\n\n\nIncreased body temperature.\u00a0Some evidence suggests that increased body temperature (hyperthermia) in the early weeks of pregnancy may increase the risk of spina bifida. Increases in core body temperature, due to fever or use of a sauna or hot tub, have been associated with a slightly increased risk of spina bifida. stay out of a really hot bath in first trimester. \n\n\n\n  And my obgyn said nope to the baths and hots in first trimester especially because of birth defects and miscarriage risks.

Not an experience I wish on anyone, but I feel like the sister in this case deserved the response to it given her callousness with the miscarriage of OP's wife. \n\nThat said, I'm not sure if a miscarriage that late counts as a stillbirth or a miscarriage - either way, devastating. \n\nI hope you've recovered well, physically and mentally.", "Oh!", "You literally asked and they answered. What are you trying to get at if I may ask? I don\u2019t understand what you want or are trying to get at.", "Absolutely nothing. I\u2019ve had similar said to me and it\u2019s disgusting. If you can dish it out be prepared to take it and if you can\u2019t then maybe reflect on your words. \n\nActions? Very different, I wouldn\u2019t murder someone as much as I would want too if they murdered someone I loved, but  Words? Fair game. Say something fucked up to me and I\u2019ll say it right back but worse \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I'm not prepared to engage in a philosophical conversation with somebody who takes the literal definition of a saying.\n\nEverybody knows you can have your cake and eat it too, that's why it's a saying. Don't take it so literally.\n\nPoint is, rise above.\nBe a better human that isn't controled by the adversity your faced.\n\nUse it as your motivation, not as your crutch", "As if shitting on a grieving mother would've made the life of OP any Better", "I've met religious people that are some of the nicest people, I've met religious people that are some of the worst people. \nI've met atheists that are the worst people and atheists that are some of the best people.\n\nI really don't care what other arbitrary label you give somebody.\nI'm also not going to rely somebody to stop the toxic cycle happening in my life, it's my responsibility.\nAnd lastly, retaliation is for those of weak emotional regulation and will. \nI'm not going to cheer hate, no matter where it comes from. \nRetaliation doesn't make you right, it just makes everybody wrong.", "Disagree. I have no stigma about it but many women have a very serious negative reaction to the term \"abortion\" & as much as it fits my ideals & furthers my beliefs,  they're entitled to their prerogative. I think it'd  be very insensitive & mentally stressful for them to constantly hear that they had a \"spontaneous abortion\"  as opposed to a \"miscarriage. \" It's not good medical practice to put normalizing medical terminology over the well being of the patient.", "Actually it might be doing the opposite and leading cons to ban it because it has the word abortion in it.  \n\nJust a thought", "They need a breather.  If the line is blanket empathy, OP failed too.\n\nWhat I'm getting at is that if when someone acts poorly, it immediately becomes acceptable/justifies a similarly poor response, then that's a very scary, slippery slope.\n\nPeople here often justify awful responses with \"well they deserved it\"!  What I'm asking is... ok how far would you go?  Where's the line?\n\nEdit: In broader terms, what I'm looking for is a sensible debate on a tricky subject. When people actually engage (as opposed to just screaming their unwavering opinion), it can be very interesting!", "Hmmm. That's fair enough to me. I suppose I just personally place a much higher significance on the words people choose.", "They didn\u2019t take it literally they just used the analogy to demonstrate their point. Dude just say you couldn\u2019t find a good response and go", "Ban \"spontaneous abortions,\" you mean like they are already trying to do by accusing women of indusing miscarriages? The ship is sailed. Better to get the middle ground desensitised to the word.", "You draw the line where it goes against your morals. You can\u2019t stop someone for saying something horrible but you can throw back your own that holds up to your morals.", "No what you\u2019re looking for is people to agree with what you want not a debate", "I normally don\u2019t like slippery slope arguments because by using that, anything can be a problem using slippery slope, and it\u2019s always used by disingenuous people trying to get rid of something because they personally don\u2019t like it.\n\nA common slippery slope is that if we allow gays to exist, that soon we will be allowing animal fuckers and child diddlers.\n\nA slippery slope is known as a fallacy because it all revolves around fear. You saying that OP giving her sister a taste of her own medicine is a slippery slope to being worse is based on your fear that humans as a whole will only get worse if we allow ourselves, to which it\u2019s inevitable that some will, but not most of us. Op said her piece because her sister had no empathy on it and threw her relationship with her sister away over a man that had hateful viewpoints. Literally her sister\u2019s actions and words almost led to OP\u2019s wife killing herself, so she really needed that reality check because she didn\u2019t realize how bad she made it for them, even after that.", "I do too. I\u2019m more often more hurt by peoples words than their actions. I can forgive (some) actions, but harsh words I\u2019ll never forgive or forget. \n\nThe response to something so harsh is almost always based on emotion and not truth, and because of that I\u2019m okay reciprocating that same energy they gave me.", "If I respond in a similar manner I always regret it. Always. It makes me feel awful later on and I wish I had never engaged. PARTICULARLY if the response was driven by emotion."]}
