And it is a good thing Jared came with.", "Can I ask why you're asking a year later? Are you feeling guilty or has your fiance brought it up at all? Are you trying to reach out so they will help with the wedding?\n\nAt face value, it seems like the situation was building up for a while, but the way you blew up wasn't kind. It probably should have come from your fiance and not you if anything. If you feel bad, maybe just apologise for what you said to his face and maybe you'll be able to be civil now that you've moved out.", ">Jared pushed him off and said nothing. \n\nDoes your fianc\u00e9 ever defend his relationship with you? \n\n\nESH.

But children of toxic parents still miss them and long for their approval. Being away from his dad may be good, but also hurting. \n\nInstead of focussing on you and your part in it, try to talk to your fiancee about his past relationship with his parents, how growing up was, and how it shapes his feelings. Try to let go of seeking a judgement/approval for yourself, I think it didn't even matter in the big picture, even if you did a wrong thing. Because if his dad was a good parent, your fiancee might not have decided to pack up and leave. \n\nAlso...not inviting his parents, was that also his choice?", "I fucked up.", "I messed up. NTA.
