Our Mom's were pregnant together, we went to school together and even lived together while her parents went through a divorce. In short, she is more like a sister to me and I would do anything for her, including turning down one of the best opportunities I had. \n\nAt the end of my senior year, I had two great college offers, a large in-state school or a much more prestigious private university out-of-state that was offering me almost full tuition. On top of that, I have always dreamt of leaving my state and going somewhere where I feel I belong, which I knew this school could give me. \n\nHowever, I turned down the offer because Jane was so upset about the thought of me leaving and wanted us to room together at the In-state school, plus I was getting a full ride from them. So I chose to stay and have since spent over $7,000 (along with my parents) on dorm decor for our room. I have tried to stay positive, though each day I regret the decision I made to stay, I hate the college I chose. But I always remind myself that I did it for my friend and at least we'd be in it together.\n\nBut everything changed a week ago, when Jane told me she was pregnant. This came after months of me warning her to stop constantly having unprotected sex, as she would always swear by the pull out method and never using condoms. I'm talking constant arguments over it. However, Jane is a chronic idiot and I know that now. She doesn't listen, she thinks she has some kind of immunity to harm and now is crying at my doorstep over the situation she got herself into, and I have zero sympathy. Not only that, but I kind of hate her for it.\n\nWhen Jane told me, the first thing I said was \"I gave up the best college offer I could get so you would be happy, and now it was all for nothing.\" followed by much harsher words, ones I never thought I would ever say to her. She's extremely emotional and scared for the future. We live in a state, where she can't get end it legally even though that would be her first choice, and her parents are far too conservative to take her out of state for it. Meaning the only options are to pray, or cope. \n\nShe broke down after this, screaming at me telling me I was being so unfair and cruel after she made a mistake, but to me it's more than a mistake, one that doesn't just effect her. I never want to judge teenage moms, my mom was one. But when I gave up so much to stay with her and now she will probably not even be able to go to college, plus the months of warning her against having unprotected sex, make me not even want to talk to her. I've supported her through thick and thin for years, but my patience is up. I feel that because of her I'm stuck in the state I dream to get out of, and there was no point in my decision at all.

That was not the time for that. Sounds like you've been harboring that resentment for this entire time when that was actually your decision.

I understand your frustration on her constantly ignoring your warnings and she may be more wreckless than the norm in that regard but one does not have anything to do with the other. You choose to pick that school and that life. Your first adult decision. One could say that's just as dumb of a decision as regular unprotected sex can be as both can affect your future. Family will be there after college. You will make many more bad decisions in life and yours can be corrected as others have noted (you can switch schools) but hers right now cannot be and she needed you there to help work through her thoughts and feelings. Oh.. and she is an adult.  She can go across state lines and never have to tell her parents if that's the route she wants to take. Maybe your decision to go to that school was the universe's plan bc you wouldn't have been there for her if you went elsewhere and maybe she needs you to be there. Even if you're feelings are valid this was not the time to express them to her. i hope you're friendship isn't ruined and you should apologize. Then have a talk about her future actions if she does get an abortion and hopefully that will change.

In a situation like this, you are absolutely not in the wrong to think about yourself first. You clearly care a lot for this friend, and have proved that in the past. Sacrificing a dream for the well-being of a friend, only for it to get dismantled by a situation you tried to prevent is understandably infuriating. This is obviously going to be very distressing for her and I understand her pain as well, it's going to be tough no matter what happens. But you're fine in setting boundaries there.

Your relationship seems to unravel, you should think more about yourself OP.", "NAH. But i\u2019ll go with what other commenters said\u2014return all the items and reach out to the school to see if you can still go. Your friend is irresponsible and an idiot, but it sounds like you already knew that and put up with it until you started blaming her for decisions you\u2019ve made. You both sound like immature teenagers. Take this as a really hard life lesson and don\u2019t put your dreams to the side just for what someone else wants.", "NTA. I can empathize with you throwing away massive opportunities for friends to love you more/not be angry. It sucks you made that choice and regret it, and it sucks you\u2019re in a position very unhappy.

Like especially if I lived in a state like that I\u2019d be super careful!", "OP gave up one of the most life changing events a Women can go through for this idiot who thought she was immune to pregnancy - the hell is wrong with you?", "clearly you haven\u2019t smelt 50 dollar donut scented candles.", "If she spent $7k on \u201cdorm room decor\u201d how can there be no money to travel for an abortion? \n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s $7k combined, but OP if this is your best friend and she wants an abortion, I\u2019d be doing everything I can to get her that help. \n\nAll the other shit is just stupid stuff right now. This is life changing, even if you cut her out afterwards, it\u2019s someone you\u2019ve been best friends with for 18 years. Can your mom help? \n\nI\u2019d also 100% be calling that other school asking if you can go. \n\nThese two things are not related. You can maintain Friendships going to other schools, but it seems this one is pretty badly damaged by a lack of communication. I think it could be fixed if you both want it.", "Did you miss the part where she\u2019s 18 and can travel where ever she wants to go including states where abortion is legal.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t believe 18-23 year olds are adults, the law does so she can get an abortion if she wants.", "I think we need more info about that. It's reasonable for Jane to be upset at the thought of leaving, but unless she explicitly asked OP to stay or tried to manipulate and guilt trip her into staying, then it was solely OP's decision to choose the in state college. I can totally see why OP would notice Jane being upset and feel like she has to do something about it-she is 18 and I'm not gonna expect her to be as mature as someone my age-but did she make the decision just bc she didn't want Jane to be upset or bc Jane straight up ask/expect her to stay?", "She's just as stupid for giving it up. Make decisions you won't regret. Holding it against her friend in a situation totally unrelated to that is immature.   \n\n\nThats like people in a relationship controlling every step of their partner because they cheated on them before.  \nIf you don't trust them anymore, move on. You can't use it against them if you were willing to forgive  whenever you like for the rest of your lifes.  \nThere's hundreds of analogys for this.\n\nIf they were married its different. You have to plan your lives together. But doing it for a friend is stupid.", "There is absolutely nothing wrong with me. I just call it like I see it. I also don't knock others just because their opinion is different from mine. After all, you know what they say about opinions......", "Which was her choice.", "That whole room is gonna smell like Dunkin'", "I\u2019m picturing basic duvet set and towels then like 1000 candles ala Phantom of the Opera.", "If she can afford to travel.", "You lack series reading comprehension of OP post if that is what your logic came up with.", "they smell elite", "Get a job make some money\u2026borrow some from friends.\n\nLots of excuses is all I\u2019m hearing.", "You may want to check your \"series\" lack of vocabulary skills before you call out my reading comprehension. Here's a little life tip for you. It's OK to have a difference of opinion without putting someone else down just because they don't agree with you.", "In time to get an abortion before the deadline runs out\u2026. Right\u2026.   In the States\u2026 \n Look, I agree that if she wanted it bad enough, she\u2019d find a way. It\u2019s 2023 and the interwebs exist. I\u2019d be researching left and right for help. But this girl thought the pull out method would work. Even OP described her as chronically stupid. I don\u2019t expect much from her. \n\nOP made a very juvenile decision to put her life on hold for a childhood friendship. It was stupid, yes. But I sympathize. I hope she learns from this. Was she an AH to her friend? Yeah. But I kinda think calling out stupidity where you find it is okay. She has only just realized she finds it in her friend. \n\nOP, I had a friend who used no bc in college and called it an accident when she got pregnant.  The truth is if you aren\u2019t using bc, then you are trying to get pregnant. Full stop. \n\nNAH in my book. OPs friend made an immature mistake she\u2019s going to have to deal with for probably at least 18 years. OP made an immature mistake that may affect her as well. She\u2019s allowed to be upset. But honestly, OP, everyone is right that this is ultimately on you. You are an adult now and need to start thinking about your needs and not your hs friend\u2019s."]}
