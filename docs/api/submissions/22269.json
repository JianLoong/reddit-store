Our Mom's were pregnant together, we went to school together and even lived together while her parents went through a divorce. In short, she is more like a sister to me and I would do anything for her, including turning down one of the best opportunities I had. \n\nAt the end of my senior year, I had two great college offers, a large in-state school or a much more prestigious private university out-of-state that was offering me almost full tuition. On top of that, I have always dreamt of leaving my state and going somewhere where I feel I belong, which I knew this school could give me. \n\nHowever, I turned down the offer because Jane was so upset about the thought of me leaving and wanted us to room together at the In-state school, plus I was getting a full ride from them. So I chose to stay and have since spent over $7,000 (along with my parents) on dorm decor for our room. I have tried to stay positive, though each day I regret the decision I made to stay, I hate the college I chose. But I always remind myself that I did it for my friend and at least we'd be in it together.\n\nBut everything changed a week ago, when Jane told me she was pregnant. This came after months of me warning her to stop constantly having unprotected sex, as she would always swear by the pull out method and never using condoms. I'm talking constant arguments over it. However, Jane is a chronic idiot and I know that now. She doesn't listen, she thinks she has some kind of immunity to harm and now is crying at my doorstep over the situation she got herself into, and I have zero sympathy. Not only that, but I kind of hate her for it.\n\nWhen Jane told me, the first thing I said was \"I gave up the best college offer I could get so you would be happy, and now it was all for nothing.\" followed by much harsher words, ones I never thought I would ever say to her. She's extremely emotional and scared for the future. We live in a state, where she can't get end it legally even though that would be her first choice, and her parents are far too conservative to take her out of state for it. Meaning the only options are to pray, or cope. \n\nShe broke down after this, screaming at me telling me I was being so unfair and cruel after she made a mistake, but to me it's more than a mistake, one that doesn't just effect her. I never want to judge teenage moms, my mom was one. But when I gave up so much to stay with her and now she will probably not even be able to go to college, plus the months of warning her against having unprotected sex, make me not even want to talk to her. I've supported her through thick and thin for years, but my patience is up. I feel that because of her I'm stuck in the state I dream to get out of, and there was no point in my decision at all.

That was not the time for that. Sounds like you've been harboring that resentment for this entire time when that was actually your decision. I'm sorry but most teenagers do not think of consequences as the brain is developing until like 24 so for an 18yo to think pregnancy or an STD won't hit them is kind of a normal occurrence (\"that won't happen to me\"). I understand your frustration on her constantly ignoring your warnings and she may be more wreckless than the norm in that regard but one does not have anything to do with the other. You choose to pick that school and that life. Your first adult decision. One could say that's just as dumb of a decision as regular unprotected sex can be as both can affect your future. Family will be there after college. You will make many more bad decisions in life and yours can be corrected as others have noted (you can switch schools) but hers right now cannot be and she needed you there to help work through her thoughts and feelings. Oh.. and she is an adult.  She can go across state lines and never have to tell her parents if that's the route she wants to take. Maybe your decision to go to that school was the universe's plan bc you wouldn't have been there for her if you went elsewhere and maybe she needs you to be there. Even if you're feelings are valid this was not the time to express them to her. i hope you're friendship isn't ruined and you should apologize. Then have a talk about her future actions if she does get an abortion and hopefully that will change.

In a situation like this, you are absolutely not in the wrong to think about yourself first. You clearly care a lot for this friend, and have proved that in the past. Sacrificing a dream for the well-being of a friend, only for it to get dismantled by a situation you tried to prevent is understandably infuriating. This is obviously going to be very distressing for her and I understand her pain as well, it's going to be tough no matter what happens. But you're fine in setting boundaries there. She can be upset and she can be in pain, but if you don't want to hear it, she needs to understand why.", "Nta\n\n>You can only play with fire for so long, and then it'll burn ya", "NTA. Your relationship seems to unravel, you should think more about yourself OP.", "NAH. But i\u2019ll go with what other commenters said\u2014return all the items and reach out to the school to see if you can still go. Your friend is irresponsible and an idiot, but it sounds like you already knew that and put up with it until you started blaming her for decisions you\u2019ve made. You both sound like immature teenagers. Take this as a really hard life lesson and don\u2019t put your dreams to the side just for what someone else wants.", "NTA. I can empathize with you throwing away massive opportunities for friends to love you more/not be angry. It sucks you made that choice and regret it, and it sucks you\u2019re in a position very unhappy. I myself never made a radical change (yet\ud83d\ude2d) to improve my life because I\u2019m comfortable enough just being alive at this point, so I hope you can make a radical decision and live your best life.", "She can still go to college if she wants to.
