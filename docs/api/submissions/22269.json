Our Mom's were pregnant together, we went to school together and even lived together while her parents went through a divorce. In short, she is more like a sister to me and I would do anything for her, including turning down one of the best opportunities I had. \n\nAt the end of my senior year, I had two great college offers, a large in-state school or a much more prestigious private university out-of-state that was offering me almost full tuition. On top of that, I have always dreamt of leaving my state and going somewhere where I feel I belong, which I knew this school could give me. \n\nHowever, I turned down the offer because Jane was so upset about the thought of me leaving and wanted us to room together at the In-state school, plus I was getting a full ride from them. So I chose to stay and have since spent over $7,000 (along with my parents) on dorm decor for our room. I have tried to stay positive, though each day I regret the decision I made to stay, I hate the college I chose. But I always remind myself that I did it for my friend and at least we'd be in it together.\n\nBut everything changed a week ago, when Jane told me she was pregnant. This came after months of me warning her to stop constantly having unprotected sex, as she would always swear by the pull out method and never using condoms. I'm talking constant arguments over it. However, Jane is a chronic idiot and I know that now. She doesn't listen, she thinks she has some kind of immunity to harm and now is crying at my doorstep over the situation she got herself into, and I have zero sympathy. Not only that, but I kind of hate her for it.\n\nWhen Jane told me, the first thing I said was \"I gave up the best college offer I could get so you would be happy, and now it was all for nothing.\" followed by much harsher words, ones I never thought I would ever say to her. She's extremely emotional and scared for the future. We live in a state, where she can't get end it legally even though that would be her first choice, and her parents are far too conservative to take her out of state for it. Meaning the only options are to pray, or cope. \n\nShe broke down after this, screaming at me telling me I was being so unfair and cruel after she made a mistake, but to me it's more than a mistake, one that doesn't just effect her. I never want to judge teenage moms, my mom was one. But when I gave up so much to stay with her and now she will probably not even be able to go to college, plus the months of warning her against having unprotected sex, make me not even want to talk to her. I've supported her through thick and thin for years, but my patience is up. I feel that because of her I'm stuck in the state I dream to get out of, and there was no point in my decision at all.

That was not the time for that. Sounds like you've been harboring that resentment for this entire time when that was actually your decision.

I understand your frustration on her constantly ignoring your warnings and she may be more wreckless than the norm in that regard but one does not have anything to do with the other. You choose to pick that school and that life. Your first adult decision. One could say that's just as dumb of a decision as regular unprotected sex can be as both can affect your future. Family will be there after college. You will make many more bad decisions in life and yours can be corrected as others have noted (you can switch schools) but hers right now cannot be and she needed you there to help work through her thoughts and feelings. Oh.. and she is an adult.  She can go across state lines and never have to tell her parents if that's the route she wants to take. Maybe your decision to go to that school was the universe's plan bc you wouldn't have been there for her if you went elsewhere and maybe she needs you to be there. Even if you're feelings are valid this was not the time to express them to her. i hope you're friendship isn't ruined and you should apologize. Then have a talk about her future actions if she does get an abortion and hopefully that will change.

In a situation like this, you are absolutely not in the wrong to think about yourself first. You clearly care a lot for this friend, and have proved that in the past. Sacrificing a dream for the well-being of a friend, only for it to get dismantled by a situation you tried to prevent is understandably infuriating. This is obviously going to be very distressing for her and I understand her pain as well, it's going to be tough no matter what happens. But you're fine in setting boundaries there.

Your relationship seems to unravel, you should think more about yourself OP.", "NAH. But i\u2019ll go with what other commenters said\u2014return all the items and reach out to the school to see if you can still go. Your friend is irresponsible and an idiot, but it sounds like you already knew that and put up with it until you started blaming her for decisions you\u2019ve made. You both sound like immature teenagers. Take this as a really hard life lesson and don\u2019t put your dreams to the side just for what someone else wants.", "NTA. I can empathize with you throwing away massive opportunities for friends to love you more/not be angry. It sucks you made that choice and regret it, and it sucks you\u2019re in a position very unhappy.

Maybe you could use this time to support her during her pregnancy and birth before you head off to college. \n\nAlso YTA for big time for being so hard on her instead of being her rock. It happens. It happens ALL the time. People have babies. They make dumb mistakes. They can still continue to straighten their life, it'll just be a bit harder to juggle. It's not the end of the world.", "It's got to be a typo. All of the furniture in my 2 bed apartment combined with all of the bedding and decor wouldn't add up to 7k. Dorms are usually a bit bigger than a closet and come with a bed and a desk.", "7k for a dorm room but the only option for her life long best friend whose unexpectedly pregnant the summer before college is to \u2018pray and cope\u2019. Nope you sell that dorm furniture and go to wherever you need to go to get this done. Then start school together in the spring with a cheaply decorated dorm, problem solved \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f apparently nice furniture means more to her than her friend\u2019s future.", "Right? I decorated an entire 4 bedroom house for less than that!", "If you are shopping pottery barn/urban outfitters...", "This screams Ole Miss to me.", "THIS. Like how is that even possible?! I lived in the dorms at college, and I decorated with the finest fast food drive thru signs my high school friends and I swiped the previous summer. Cost me $0 and they were amazing conversation pieces. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Me too, WTF", "This was my thought too. How is that even possible? My dorm room had like 2 $20 rugs and some posters", "This!  You made a choice and you didn\u2019t like that choice and now you\u2019re using your friends pregnancy as the rationale.  No one forced you to stay, you could have attended your dream school.  \n\nYta\u2026you\u2019re friend is in a difficult position and you\u2019re blaming her for a choice you made and your regret of not choosing your dream school.  \n\nHow does one spend $7k on dorm decor?", "I mean, it\u2019s honestly ESH. The friend is in a crappy situation of her own making. This was her choosing to gamble every time she had sex and openly admitting it to OP. 18 year olds are often naive but they know enough to know they can get pregnant. Friend also whined about OP going out of state for selfish reasons, and that was shitty. \n\nBut everything you said about OP also being responsible for her choice is true\u2014and who tf spends $7000 on dorm decor??!", "Both have them have been really stupid. I hope they mature a bit and make better choices in the future.", "Agree she should have made her own decision, but the friend guilted her into staying so she\u2019s NTA for unloading on her when the friend screwed up the whole \u201cstay and let\u2019s be roomies\u201d plan", "yes!!! i was in a sort of similar situation - i also chose to go to a state school to room with my best friend, it was her idea. i had gotten into a lot of schools, but really liked the idea of living with my friend. \n\nthe difference here is i wanted to do it too. if i felt any resentment or regret at all i wouldn\u2019t have done it. i also wasn\u2019t set on any school or academic program, and didn\u2019t want to go far away. it ended up being a good choice and a good fit for me, and living with her was great! we\u2019re still best friends. she actually ended up transferring later on and i still didn\u2019t regret my school choice because i ended up liking it. there are some situations where this can work out, but it sounds like op didn\u2019t even want to live with her friend that much in the first place", "I really wish the was a YTD (you\u2019re the Dumbass) because boy howdy that was an incredibly boneheaded decision", "Right? If you've got 7k for dorm furniture, then you can spare enough to drive a state or 2 over with your friend for a short vacation. If she seriously doesn't want to have the baby, then please help her. I love my kids, but I am so grateful that I had them when I was ready to because I know there were times in my life when I wouldn't have been able to handle it.", "This. \n\nOP, you made the stupid decision to stay for your friend (we don\u2019t need to beat you up for this, you clearly already feel shitty), now be there for your friend. She needs support and the best way you can help is to use some of that obscene money you have to help her get out of state for a little vacation to the clinic. \n\nYou need to get over yourself and if you hate your state so much, then move away after college.", "Her \u201cworld broke apart\u201d because she had unprotected sex and it was completely avoidable. You\u2019re acting like it was an act of god or something. The friend is suffering the consequences of her own actions. Nobody should have any pity for the friend and you acting like OP is an AH for not pitying her is ridiculous. The right response is ESH bc OP was dumb enough to give up her dream for her dumbfuck friend.", "That\u2019s 18 year olds for you.", "It's July, it's almost certainly too late to switch schools.  But you're right that is not too late for a road trip.\n\nOP, return some dorm decor and book a hotel room for a summer trip ASAP.  I would drop anything to help my worst enemy get an abortion, never mind my best friend.\n\nMake this happen.", "If it\u2019s an elite school OP\u2019s spot was probably already given to someone on the waitlist. But she should still contact them to see if there is any chance of reversing her decision or getting onto the waitlist. At the very least, she should talk to the admissions office about starting a transfer plan", "Yes, OP should get in trouble with admissions at her dream school asap and start discussing a transfer application and plan.", "They\u2019ve definitely already given the spot to someone on the waitlist but OP should still contact then about the transfer process or see if it\u2019s not too late to be put in the waitlist herself", "Maybe they found a discounted Renoir painting?", "Maybe quality LEDs, a good full size mirror, if they\u2019re bunking their beds maybe a futon, and a really nice rug? Idek", "I didn't spend that much on my *house* and we have antique Stickley in the living room.", "Even then you really can\u2019t get to 7,000, I don\u2019t know any schools that let you bring in outside furniture (like your own bed or desk) and I can\u2019t see other dorm decorations and bedding adding up to 7,000. I feel like 700 is more likely", "There's also a system to help people obtain abortions called \"Auntie Network\" (on Reddit) please please let your friend know there are options.", "Of course she could have afforded to pay for her friend to travel to California if she hadn\u2019t spent $7,000 on dorm room decor!", ">How does one spend $7k on dorm decor?\n\nAsking the fucking real questions here.", "Honestly, if she dropped $7k on d\u00e9cor, for a temporary room, money isn't an issue. No one who struggles is going to turn down an almost completely free full ride through college unless it was serious, like their siblings would be out on the street without them taking care of them and the school was out of state. Family wouldn't have even let you turn it down if you were dumb enough to do so. \n\nYeah the friend went full guilt trip but OP made the choice to give it up and she wasn't even happy to begin with. I think even if the friend didn't get pregnant, OP was close to boiling over anyways and would have yelled at her over finding an unwashed fork left in the sink.", "Everyone sucks here", "Everyone sucks here", "It\u2019s entirely possible to view the friend\u2019s unwanted pregnancy as a consequence of her own irresponsibility *while also* feeling pity towards a scared teen in a bad situation. Empathy is a muscle.", "Ah, a teen crying in distress about an unwanted pregnancy, what a totally bizarre and unexpected emotional reaction. \n\nShe messed up really bad and behaved stupidly and should have been more responsible, for certain. No doubt. That\u2019s established. But she\u2019s also an imperfect 18 year old, and the sheer amount of poisonous hate aimed at her is staggering. Speaks to society\u2019s resentment of teenage girls/disregard for their humanity.", "For sure. It was really just meant for her to call the school she preferred, now, to see what options she would have for transferring. She wrote about school like she could never change it.\n\nGreat idea about returning some of the decor for the road trip.", "OP is just as much of an idiot as her \u201csister\u201d to be fair. So yea her sister getting screamed at and blamed for all of OPs decisions make her TA", "OP is going to be even sadder when she can't burn those in the dorm because they don't allow open flames.", "I know inflations gone up this year but last I checked that\u2019s still no where close to 7k.", "Are the LEDs made of solid gold or\u2026??", "I agree it is ridiculous. But I could totally do it. \n\nWhich is why I look for inspo and then thrift! haha", "If your friend wants an abortion, we can help her over at r/abortion. She has options.", "Ive read outrageous things before but im not sure ill ever emotionally recover from someone spending SEVEN. THOUSAND. DOLLARS. on dorm decor. Did they build a new bathroom? Take out a wall???? What the actual f???", "I want to know how this was done lol", "Are serious? OP warned her friend multiple times to stop having unprotected sex. She didn\u2019t and is now pregnant. And you want OP to be empathetic to her? Gtfo. That\u2019s like warning someone to stop playing Russian roulette with a loaded gun and then expecting them to feel empathy when the person shoots themselves. At some point, personal responsibility is an actual thing. Someone who accidentally gets pregnant after protecting themselves, fine. It happens, more than most people want to believe. But someone who has unprotected sex? That\u2019s just dumb. It\u2019s her friend\u2019s own fault and there is no reason for OP to be empathetic. Being willfully stupid does not warrant empathy.", "Thank you for saying this!\n\nPlus, if they're in a state where she can't get an abortion, and she comes from a conservative family that would forbid her from getting one, then it's also pretty safe to assume that this girl's sex ed was abysmal at best. She may have genuinely thought the pull out method was effective, despite OP's arguments to the contrary.", "Yep. Support pregnant teens, not teen pregnancy.", "Depending on what state she's in, a ceas could be 1,000 miles away. She'd have to pay for gas, airfare, or bus fare plus a hotel. It really inaccessible for poor women. The family members and flings of the fascists who made these laws will, of course, never be affected because their \"pro-life\" rich lovers and family members can pay for them to travel.", "and each one\u2019s a different scent. like the classic chocolate thhem you\u2019ve got alaskan maple leaves infused with james cordons sweat. and they get progressively worse and worse the more you look at them.", "I used to buy the krispy creme one. Would have them in bathroom. Room would smell like the original glazed.", "you can\u2019t have open flames in dorm rooms?!?!? what short of phsycopaths run that place?", "I mean I would have to assume so. Because how else do spend that much to decorate a little room?", "What would you buy to get to 7,000 for a dorm room? Without any large furniture I legit don\u2019t get how that is possible. I know their stuff is crazy expensive and I could easily spend 2,000 on my dream dorm but 7,000??", "It's just one futon, dipped in GOLD!", "Did you learn about sex from your family or from school? C'mon. A quick Google would tell her that pulling out isn't birth control. Don't act like she's any kind of victim here. ESH.", "That's fire code motherfucka. It's not school policy or whatever, it's a rule set by the fire marshall to keep people alive.", "that\u2019s outrageous. me and OP want to hold out donut scented renascence with our 100 oldly scented candles and youre telling me we can\u2019t?", "It\u2019s almost like the friend who spent $7k on dorm decor could probably afford to gift her the money for travel and procedure if she doesn\u2019t have it.\n\nLike this whole pregnancy thing really is a non-issue for adults with 2 brain cells to rub together. \nThe bottom line is OP is just angry she gave up her dream school for someone else, and chose to take out her frustrations on someone she called a friend"]}
