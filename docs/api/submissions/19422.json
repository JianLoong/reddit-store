We have both been married before, we both have kids of different ages (mine 18 and his 7), I had a nasty divorce 10 years ago that turned into a pretty civil coparenting partnership after about 4-5 years, he had a nasty divorce 3 years ago that is still in court for modifications to custody where both my boyfriend and his ex attack and trigger the other and is beyond stressful to witness let alone be involved in.\n\nThe situation is as follows: boyfriend had gone back and forth about introducing me to his child, which I honestly support his decision regardless of what he decides. Currently he states that he is not comfortable doing so because he wants to protect his child\u2019s heart and feelings, which I also support. The twist is because he is living paycheck to paycheck and usually needs to work on days that fall during his scheduled visitation times, he has presented the \u201copportunity\u201d for me to build a relationship with his child as his on demand babysitter and even introduces me as his \u201creally good friend\u201d who will be helping out by watching them while he is at work. \n\nI don\u2019t get to hang out with them when boyfriend doesn\u2019t work because that is his time with his child. He wants me to continue being his babysitter for 3 more months before telling his child who I am to him. This plan didn\u2019t make me feel very good and like I was just a beneficially convenient financial solution to his stressful work/life balance and I tried to communicate that to him and tried to find some middle ground. I suggested that if he wanted to wait to introduce me, then he should find alternative sitter options so that all our feelings could be considered and respected.\n\nHe on the other hand is saying that me not wanting to babysit is an ultimatum and one that is meant to force him to do something he is not comfortable doing. Despite my attempts to validate his feelings as well as mine by setting some internal boundaries, he is angry and upset at me and has started to compare me to how his ex \u201cabused\u201d him and I how I am the asshole in this.\n\nSo there is the question, AITA for not wanting to just be the \u201cbabysitter\u201d when he is not ready to introduce me as someone more to his child?", "created_utc": 1686370909, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/145qam2/aita_if_i_dont_want_to_be_my_boyfriends/", "score": 31, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even if he introduces you as his girlfriend,  you should not be obliged to provide him with free babysitting services.  That he refuses to acknowledge your relationship to his children is just adding insult to injury.", "Honey, he is using you as a free babysitter with no plan to introduce you as anyone particularly special because when he no longer needs you as a sitter, he will no longer need you at all. \nNTA and I\u2019m so very sorry.", "NTA you are not his girlfriend; you are the babysitter with side benefits.  You are at very different points in life.  You are entering the empty nest stage and he is new in fatherhood.  He is now lashing out at you when you say no to being slave labor.  Run from this man. There is a reason he is divorced and living paycheck to paycheck and fighting to see his kid.", "NTA, if BF wants to introduce you to his kid, he should do it as his GF, not as a babysitter, that, if nothing else is going to come back to bite him in the ass with divorce \"Daddy started sleeping with the babysitter\" makes for a really bad impression in custody arrangements.  \n\n\nYour BF is being TA by making it out to be an ultimatum, you just don't want to be \"the babysitter\" he can choose to hire a babysitter if he wants one.", "NTA. Unfortunately that's just what you would be: a free, on-demand babysitter.", "NTA. Y'all have only been together 3 months. It would be one thing if you were cool with it but him trying to guilt you into it isn't where it's at.", "NTA, lol, the audacity of this man wanting a free babysitter", "NTA\n\nNo wonder he and his ex don\u2019t get along. I bet you in three months\u2019 time he\u2019ll have another reason why his child can\u2019t know who you are. Just cut your losses, op and get out of this relationship.", "NTA. Three months is too soon to introduce you to his young child or lock you into a relationship with his child. This has big red flags where you are locked in as his childcare while he continues his acrimonious relationship with his ex and you find out he's perpetuating the drama and can't reasonable exit without him guilting you. Its crystal clear the fact that you should not get more involved with this person, you are an asshole to yourself if you let him lure you into a deeper relationship.\n\nMy ex needed help with his kids so I was introduced way too early as a friend and the vilification from his children's mothers when they found out I wasn't just a friend made matters much worse and even more unpleasant: he liked that they were pissed about me and wanted me to wallow in the drama. I was 20 and noped the fuck out. I see all the same risks for you. Run.", "Nta, girl leave him alone.", "NTA and dump his ass immediately.", "NTA\n\nBreak up. He sees you as a free babysitter.\n\nAnd since he's still batylingvthe ex about custody, he's really not available for a relationship.", "NTA.\n\nHe\u2019s already using and abusing you, calling you an asshole. I\u2019m willing to bet money that he was the major issue in his marriage. Get out now.", "NTA. You are absolutely right in the way you are thinking.", "NTA \n\nI agree that a parent's love interests should not be paraded in and out of a child's life until the timing is right for the child and it appears that the person will (presumably) be around long term.\n\nHowever, if he introduces you as \"Daddy's very good friend\" but never hangs out with you when the kid is around, that would be weird by itself. I can imagine the questions now. \"Daddy, is Ms. Jane your friend or mine? If Ms. Jane is your friend, why does she always leave when you come home?\"", "You are NTA, but your BF sounds like one.  His almost demanding your childcare services under his terms creeps me out.  Something feels very off about that.  And, his seeming to turn on you when you don't agree to do this feels like a red flag to me.  I think your instincts are telling you something isn't right because it isn't.", "NTA. But also why do you want to spend time with the both of them? Then you\u2019d have to babysit two children.", "Ummm NO!\n\nHe just wants a babysitter. NTA", "NTA but girl he is using you so lte me get this straight he is ok with you babysitting his kid but don\u2019t want you to be introduced as his gf this makes no sense. \n\nAnd. Now he is mad because you don\u2019t want to babysit his for another 3 months\n\nWhy 3 months what happens in 3 months? I bet his has something to do with his divorce. \n\nThat man does not give a shit about you and you should not have agreed to babysit in the beginning. \n\nStop babysitting his kid ASAP. BECAUSE now if he agrees to tell the kid it is probably to keep you to continue to babysit the kid. \n\nTell him you will wait the 3 months to meet the kid officially as his gf and you will not babysit before than period. \n\nWho watched his kid before he met you.  The only \u201copportunity\u201d he gave you was for him to get free babysitting. \n\nYou have only been with him for 3 months is this really the type of relationship you want.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
