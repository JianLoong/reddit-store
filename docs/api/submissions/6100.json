If you have kids and pass the name down, she'll get to see her maiden name continue.", "YTA change your name when YOU get married, Like most people do that\u2019s just weird.", "Can you give an example of how bad? Are we talking like Hitler or Dahmer or something? You aren't the asshole for changing it, it's your name and your identity. Changing it to your SIL's maiden name however is pretty inconsiderate. Even if you got her blessing a lot of people would be caught off guard by such a request and affirmation would unlikely be genuine", "YTA, this is super weird.", "I feel like you\u2019re the kind of person who faces the back of the elevator while in it.", "INFO: is your brother taking her name too?", "Have you ran it by any of the other family? SIL being okay with it doesn't mean a whole lot if the rest of her family, who's still using said name, aren't okay with it", "NAH. While it may be weird and very consequential, there\u2019s not a GD\u2019d thing anyone can do about it legally.", "Weird shit bro", "Sounds like you want to marry your brother. Asshole? Idk. Weird? Damn right.", "YTA even if she agrees or has no problem with it it's still weird and creepy. \n\nChoose something outside your circle of family and friends", "Nta\n\nIf you had just picked this name after reading it in a book or something no one would think it was weird.", "NTA. Sister in law is fine with it, you\u2019d only be out of line if she asked you not to take her name. I agree it\u2019s unorthodox, but to say you\u2019re an asshole or even creepy? Nah. I\u2019m amazed at some of these reactions lol", "YTA. But, honestly, I wish I had the confidence/ignorance/whateverance to engage in this kind of weird as hell behavior without dying of embarrassment.", "You want to change your last name to your little brother\u2019s wife\u2019s maiden name?\n\nThat\u2019s weird\u2026\n\nYTA", "YTA, everyone\u2019s last name is either weird or so common they wish it was weird.", "YTA that's just so fucking weird. You can pick ANY new new last name, don't use that one. Simple.", "NTA", "NTA  I feel like TA are ignoring the fact that ur sil said she\u2019s fine with it", "NTA \n\nAfter reading that SIL doesn\u2019t have a problem with it, go ahead.", "NTA because SIL said it was okay\u2026but still very weird. I\u2019d pick a name that\u2019s less weird but not a copy of someone you know. It makes you seem creepy like a stalker.", "Nta. You've talked to SIL, she's not creeped out by it. Go for it but prepare for backlash from family desperately clinging to a last name that doesn't matter that much. \n\nI remember hearing about a family who had the same last name & were related to a very well known, evil, genocidal leader & they decided not to have kids so they didn't pass on the family name. I always wondered why they didn't just change the last name. (Of course, I heard this online so it must be true \ud83d\ude06)", "NTA. As long as your SIL is fine with this I see no problem. Also think your family is overreacting, its okay if they dont like it but disowning you over this? Wow! \nI dont get al the YTA-votes (except if they were cast before the edit).", "It's weird af of course, but NTA. Your family are the AHs for disowning you over this, they sound controlling, no wonder you hate your family name. Being weird does not make you an AH, you talked to your SIL about it which was considerate.", "Pretty stalkerish, but nothing inherently AH about it", "NTA as long as the sister's blessing is genuine and you didn't pressure her in any way. Y T A for waiting until the edit to mention her feelings about the matter as they are the most important.", "Consuela.", "Sorry I couldn\u2019t read this over all the virtue signalling", "Yeah I think it\u2019s a little weird but in no way does that mean OP is an asshole, since SIL is okay with it.", "Yeah IDK why people here are so quick to jump from \"weird\" to \"asshole.\" There is such a thing as harmlessly weird.", "And creepy", "I could have my skin coat on (skin coat on)\nI could wear my sister in law\nBut even with nothin' on\nIt\u2019s her name I took (her name I took)", "cue \"Goodbye Horses\" by Q Lazzarus", "Maybe she's a velociraptor", "I agree, it isn't only about SiL, it's about her family as well", "O M G \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23", "I mean, hard disagree here. This is such an insane request that you just be polite. You being so gouache as to ask \u201ccan I have your last name\u201d means you likely won\u2019t honor a no anyway."]}
