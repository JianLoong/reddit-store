It sounds like you want to marry your SIL. Or that you want to *be* her.\n\nLike, it doesn't matter that you don't. It sounds like you do, so very very very much. When people hear 'I changed my last name to be the same as my SIL', it sounds like you're obsessed with your SIL and want to marry her or pretend to be married to her.  Or that one day you're going to break into their home, murder them both and wear her skin like a coat. It sounds *so much* like you want to be married to your SIL that even giving the argument of \"its just a beautiful last name\" stinks of innuendo. \n\nFor the rest of your brother's life, any time this comes up on your side or his, the response going to be \"dude your older sibling *really* has the *hots* for your wife\".\n\nSo. No. Sorry; YTA. There is no way to disconnect from that.", "So when your sister in law marries your brother, you\u2019re going to\u2026 basically trade last names?\n\nThat\u2019s weird.\n\nAnd you say that you \u201cdon\u2019t know why,\u201d her last name is the only one that appeals to you\u2026 but I think you have to figure out that why. Out of all the millions of names you could pick, why is her current one so attractive to you? I think there\u2019s something there worth examining. I\u2019m not convinced that it\u2019s all about that particular combination of letters.\n\nAnd I find it hard to believe that your SIL is genuinely okay with it. It strikes me that you\u2019ve had \u201cmany long conversations\u201d on this topic\u2026 that sounds to me like you either had to convince her, or else you have some kind of deep relationship where this name swap is meant to be symbolic in some way. But symbolic of what?\n\nSo\u2026 I\u2019m gonna say YTA.", "YTA.\n\nThis is weird.", "So the SIL is okay with it? Then NTA.\n\nYour family are just hurt, but you can change your name to princess banana hammock if you so wish....", "YTA- that is incredibly creepy. And inappropriate. Did you tell your future SIL? What if she wants to keep her maiden name?\nI find it bad enough when people 'steal' baby names (and yes, I know that you down own a first name etc etc) but a surname is next level.", "YTA. There isn't any name in your entire family you like. I mean your family, not someone marrying into your family that may not be a family member 10 years from now?  Don't get my wrong, I hope your SIL is in the family for life, divorce isn't beyond the realm of possibility. \n\n I would have the choice of many names if I just picked maiden names of my mom,  grandmothers or their mothers etc.", "YTA\n\nI know you think the last name is nice, but that's still her and her family's name.

She isn't your spouse so it's weird AF. Surnames are so personal, you're not her actual sister, and somewhere down the line it could make your family tree look a little incesty too. Pick a different last name if you really need to change", "YTA bc it\u2019s weird. You said SIL was okay but how did your brother feel about it. Honesty it\u2019s just super weird. Oooo I don\u2019t like my name I like yours let me go through all these legal hoops and change my name to yours.

If you want to change your name do it, but does it have to be her last name? Have you spoken to her about it?", "Agree that it's a bit weird...\n\nDisagree with the concensus in that I think you're NTA.\n\nIf you like the name, you do you. But there are a lot of names too", "NTA but it\u2019s so freaking weird to change your name but for taking your SIL name\u2026 that is so weird\n\nThere are so many names out there and you\u2019re taking your SIL name", "Hmmm, I would like to  know what your SIL family think about this", "YTA that's beyond stupid and disrespectful", "NTA because SiL doesn\u2019t mind at all and you talked to her about it, I know how bad it can be to have a last name you don\u2019t like for XYZ reason, if you like the name and also have the blessing of the person you\u2019re \u201ccopying\u201d ? Then just do it, I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s creepy or a problem, sure it\u2019s uncommon, but some peoples here need a reality check because it\u2019s not just because you like a name that someone had you\u2019re a weirdo", "To be fair, I don\u2019t think asshole/not an asshole is the right description. But it is just a fucking weird thing to do.", "It's going to be your name. Seems like you are not doing anything maliciously and SIL is not harmed in any way. Obviously your family is hurt but people can choose what they want to be called and we should respect that. NTA", "I mean your SIL is ok with it\u2026I think it comes down to how unique her name is. Like if it was Smith then enough people have the name so there wouldn\u2019t be a connection. \n\nI understand wanting to change your name but you\u2019re going about it the wrong way.

It\u2019s not their name??", "NTA since she agreed. A couple of things to think about. If they divorce, would you feel weird? Your call.  On the other side, have some fun with this. Pick random last names and try them out with writing them, using them when introducing yourself to random people that you wouldn\u2019t give your real name to. Just for fun. Good Luck!", "NTA", "NTA for wanting to change your last name. It is a little weird to change it to your SILs name. You'll probably interact with her family at some point and that would be real awkward.  Think on it more and look at other options.", "YTA \n\nThis is super weird and not well thought through.   If you must change your name make it something else instead of being a creep.", "YTA as others have stated this is odd.", "NTA. It's weird, but not AHy, especially since you talked with your SIL and she doesn't have an issue with it.", "I also had a very weird and unusual surname, I legally changed it at my first opportunity.  But I changed it to my mother's (very normal and easy to pronounce) maiden name, not the name of some person who is about to become my SIL.  Honestly, that is quite weird.  Don't you have anyone you're actually related to whose name you can take, like your mothers or grandmothers maiden name?\n\nEDIT: Just seen that your SIL doesn't have a problem with it.  Still really weird but I guess if she doesn't care, you do you.  Now I really want to know what the beautiful last name is though.", "YTA \n\nThis is creepy and strange.", "YTA.\nCreepy...", "If you\u2019re going to change your name, change it to something cool like Consuela Bananahammock or Crapbag. \n\nAnd also, YTA.

You have every right to want to change your last name for whatever reason; it\u2019s YOUR name. \n\nWith that being said, your family that shares the same last name as you, that gave you the last name, can also feel hurt and rejected at your plans to change your name. \n\nWhere they become semi-assholes is trying to force you into not changing or picking something else and I don\u2019t think enough info is given to call them complete assholes. \n\nYou have every right to change your last name, regardless of if it\u2019s embarrassing or not, and your SIL is approving\u2026 go for it. \n\nAs someone with an embarrassing last name (literally have \u2018ass\u2019 at the end of it), I understand your struggle. I wouldn\u2019t change my name just because I\u2019ve grown to love it (plus I think it\u2019s hilarious) but you and I are not the same person.\n\nYour family (maybe) will eventually let it go but you need to think about if the long term and short term effects of this are worth it.\n\nBest of luck!!", "I mean your SIL is ok with it\u2026I think it comes down to how unique her name is.
