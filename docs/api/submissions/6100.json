Your wanting to change your name to your future SIL maiden name... this is the part that can be seen as really weird. Honestly because it is a really strange situation. Still, I don't see anything morally or subjectively wrong with it- just how you phrased the situating and went about it. Such as the \"asking for permission\" part. As mentioned in \"1\", you could have potentially come across this name anyway, but the asking for your future extended families permission and perhaps the phrasing when announcing it to your family could have come across as AH-ish behavior and as if you were wanting to join their family instead. \n\nThe only advice I can give is to try to make it clear you're not wanting to change your name to theirs \"because she's your SIL and you like the maiden name\" but rather, \"you think it's a beautiful name and would like to have the same name- but your family is how I learned of it.\" Again, it's a really weird situation, but I don't see anything AH about it other than potential delivery and handling of the topic. \n\nTL;DR: NTA- but could have possibly delivered intent and reasoning better to not come off as an AH or creepy.", "NTA. \n\nis you maiden name gaylord or something?", "YTA this is weird", "YTA I would be creeped out if my new SIL changed her last name to mine.", "NTA\n\nHaving grown up with a horrible last name, if I hadn\u2019t gotten married young I would have changed my name. \n\nIf future SIL doesn\u2019t care, why would anyone else care?", "gonna be the odd ball here, i don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s the AH, i think it\u2019s just personal feelings \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f as someone who also has an embarrassing last name i also wanna change it & since you had spoken with her about it & she has no problems with it i see no issue, especially if you don\u2019t plan on getting married & even if you do then it\u2019s temporary till you take someone else\u2019s, as long as the SIL & OP have no issue with this it\u2019s none of our business :)", "YTA.

That said, though, choosing that name given the relation to SIL is weird. I\u2019m sorry if that offends you but it is. I\u2019m also a little confused\u2026 is are family disowning you because you\u2019re changing your name *away* from their own, or because you chose SIL\u2019s maiden name? Or is it a little of both? \n\nRegardless, making the choice you\u2019re making is going to come with consequences. If your family is disowning you due to the change, and they have some traditional views regarding names, then oh well, you\u2019ll have to deal with that blowback. However, if their hang up is the name you\u2019re choosing - then I get why. No matter what you say to them, how you act, how you defend it, choosing the name of your SIL (and her family, sounds like SIL is about to change her own name at marriage) really does imply something deeper and creepier is going on. And I doubt you\u2019ll be able to convince anyone otherwise. That will be an entirely different, and possibly more damaging, blowback to deal with as a result of this decision. \n\nAlso, what is SIL\u2019s name? Is it considered common or is it also unique? What\u2019s your community like? Once you make the change, and you start using the name, will people you know or run into think nothing of it? Or are they immediately doing to think of SIL and her entire family? You say SIL is ok with it, and again, you can do whatever you want, but have you considered how SIL\u2019s family feels? How well do they know you? Sounds like they aren\u2019t pleased either, and I don\u2019t blame them. \n\nI think ultimately I\u2019m going to have to vote YTA.

You\u2019re obviously shocked by the reactions you\u2019re getting (which isn\u2019t good), so you really need to sit and consider whether changing your name to this specific name you\u2019ve picked is worth it.
