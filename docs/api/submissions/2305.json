We both live far from where we grew up / went to school but ended up in the same big city about 5 years ago. We got together often and talked all the time - but had diff lives with me being married w/ kids and her being single.\n\nShe gets engaged - I meet her fianc\u00e9 & wedding planning comes around. \n\nI am recently divorced, after a more than a decade long marriage with multiple kids. \n\nI was also in a new exclusive long distance relationship with an old (not mutual) friend. My own new relationship was great but wasn\u2019t ready to announce it.  My friend knew all of this and her and her fianc\u00e9 had met my new bf. \n\nBride doing a destination wedding at a resort that charges based on double occupancy. \n\nShe tell me she isn\u2019t doing any plus 1s for any of her guests unless they are married or in a serious relationship and since I\u2019m not in a serious relationship that I won\u2019t have a plus 1.   \n\nShe told me that because I\u2019m alone and her only single friend and the resort is expensive, she\u2019ll include me in the convos her single cousins and pair me up with someone for a room. \n\nOne day we are talking  and I said I didn\u2019t hear about rooming with the others.  She said she\u2019s not coordinating that because it\u2019s too much work but she\u2019ll put me directly in touch with her cousins for me to figure it out if I need to (I don\u2019t know her cousins). \n\nSo I casually ask her - will I know anyone at wedding and would I be sitting with them? She says she doesn\u2019t know who I know that will be there and she doesn\u2019t know where I\u2019ll be sitting since I\u2019m single and she\u2019ll stick me anywhere. \n\nSo then I ask if it would be ok to decide closer to wedding date - after the RSVP window was over and just kind of show up if I can. \nShe said no. We hung up. Then she texted me basically saying again that I won\u2019t know anyone at the wedding and it\u2019s ok if I don\u2019t come. So I said ok, I\u2019ll think about it and rsvp by the date.\n\nA few days later a mutual friend calls me up and tells me ITA for even asking such a question as I\u2019m adding unneeded stress and making the situation about me and giving \u201cmain character energy\u201d at her wedding and said it felt like I was trying to force the bride into inviting my BF to her wedding and giving me a plus one. \n\nI said I wasn\u2019t, that wasn\u2019t my intention and \n\nSo I just RSVP\u2019d \u201cno\u201d online without any conversation with the bride. \n\nI sent her a wedding gift and didn\u2019t think much of it. But we haven\u2019t spoken since and she didn\u2019t acknowledge my gift. \n\nIt feels like my question caused irreparable harm to the relationship. \n\nAITA enough to end a friendship for asking to not RSVP and show up last minute?\n\nETA: I asked because I\u2019m a newly single mom and time/money was going to be difficult but I did want to be there for her but at the same time I wasn\u2019t in the mood to plan for a huge expanse and time away for a wedding where I\u2019d be alone and didn\u2019t really know anyone - and sometimes you get last minute cancels and I thought the no plus 1 was BS \n\nEDIT 2 : I\u2019m not sure why this part isn\u2019t clear for some - when I asked if I could rsvp later, very last minute, she said no. And. I said ok! I will confirm my decision by the RSVP date. \nBut she texted me right away saying that she doesn\u2019t know who I know is attending and seating chart etc. and then had a mutual friend call, all before RSVP date. \nI then RSVP\u2019d - still before the date. And sent a gift.
