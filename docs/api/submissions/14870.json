Our teaching sessions have just finished and a group of my friends (all male) and I decided to blow of some steam at one of the bars on campus before starting to revise for exams next week. We went to the biggest bar on campus, which has an array of pool tables. My friends decided that they wanted to play pool and I sat by the table and watched them since they don\u2019t like it when I play with them, because I\u2019ve never lost against any of my friends and I\u2019m really good at it. \n\nAt some point a guy around my age who I\u2019ve seen around campus a few times but don\u2019t really know approaches me and hits on me but I politely reject him (and one of his friends). The next time he approached me, he offered me a bet - that I play pool with him and his friends and they beat me, I have to let them buy me a drink but if I win they\u2019d each give me \u00a320. I agreed, of course. I beat all 5 of them and ended up \u00a3100 better off. He tried to get me to buy him a drink and I told him that wasn\u2019t part of the deal, that I\u2019m gay and that maybe next time he should wonder why someone isn\u2019t playing with their friends instead of assuming that it\u2019s because they\u2019re not good. He accused me of knowing I was going to win the whole time, which I confirmed. Then he accused me of stealing and threw such a tantrum that all of us got kicked out of the bar and received a 1 week ban from all on campus bars. \n\nMy friends are pissed at me for causing the ban, and said I\u2019m the asshole for knowing I was going to win yet still playing and that I hustled them. One of the guys posted about it on our university page and it\u2019s caused a frankly ridiculous amount of gossip and debate on our school\u2019s social media. I just wanted to be left alone.
