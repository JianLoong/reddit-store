Lately we started to spend more time in my apartment as it's closer to both of our workplaces, and my bf has been on my case about buying things for my place since the beginning. \n\nFirst he said 'we' should buy a rug for the bedroom, because he doesn't like wearing slippers and the floor is cold in the mornings. I told him he's welcome to bring a rug for his side. He didn't. \n\nThen he got annoyed that I don't have a hair dryer and he always needs to bring his own. I have very short hair so I never needed one, and I told him I'm not going to buy one that I'm not going to use. \n\nThen he started hinting that I should get a humidifier because the dry air hurts his throat. I didn't even acknowledge that one. \n\nThe last one was the coffee maker that I didn't have, because I don't drink coffee. He drinks a lot so I relented on that one, but I bought a pretty cheap one, which is apparently not good enough, and he said he might as well 'pour boiling water over a filter with a kettle' (he has a crazy expensive machine at his place). \n\nHe says it should be basic decency to want to make your guests feel more at home, especially your partner, and while I agree to some extent, I really can't afford to buy stuff I'm never going to use, especially since we're still very much in the beginning of our relationship, and we don't technically live together.

When someone stays over, or pops in on the weekends,  you offer them coffee.\n\nHair dryers and humidifiers are on the next level out.  I think eventually you will own all of these things.  The only way he'd have a better point is if you spend a lot on stuff all the time and you want him to come to yours (vs you going to his) all the time. It is difficult for someone to go to work, then come over, w/o having a drawer or whatever and stuff they use at your place.

It ends badly.\n\nETA: NTA", "NTA.\n\nFirst question: Has *he* invested in changing his place and adding things in line with your preferences and needs? If yes, maybe you two *are* on different trajectories with this relationship, and he's \"nesting\" like crazy while you're on a \"wait and see how it goes\" attitude (which would be more normal). But I assume that the answer is \"no\". First red flag right here.\n\nSecond, it's your apartment! He can bring in a hair dryer and a rug if that's his preference. It's a pretty new relationship, and if you let him stay over you're already doing something for him. You're adding wear and tear to your place, paying for a little bit more in electricity and water, and share your space! He can give a little and add to the shared space as well. At the very least he could start a discussion about it, including how to finance things like that - rather than him hinting and expecting you do all the heavy lifting.", "NTA. You're still early days in the relationship, and this is your apartment, not his. You shouldn't be expected to shell out money you can't afford on things you won't use. If he wants a rug, he should buy one. If he wants a hair dryer at your place instead of bringing his own, he should buy one. If he wants a coffee maker like the one he owns, he should buy one. It's not up to you to cater to his expensive whims. \n\nEven if you were living together, it's on him if he wants things that you aren't going to use. Unless it's a gift, he buys the things he uses, you buy the things you use, and you both buy things you both use. \n\nI'd be seriously reconsidering this relationship, myself. The way you've described this makes it sound like he wants you to pay for everything to make him more 'comfortable' even when you can't afford to do so and will get no benefit from it. That's pretty entitled behaviour. You need to tell him that if he wants these things that you don't use, he has to buy them. If he keeps going on about you buying these things, and complaining about the things he refuses to buy, then I think it's time to end the relationship and move on.", "NTA when my partner started coming round, I bought 1 thing- an extension thing for the shower so it can go high enough for him to shower under without hurting his back.

It's not b/c of his \"uppitiness\", but more the dynamic here.\n\nI do think he's asking too much too soon and you're NTA, but if he is a straight man who dates straight woman, I guarantee your lack of hair straightener and coffee pots and rugs (I didn't see that originally) are a bit unusual, whereas this is typical for most straight women to not expect their boyfriend to have hair straighteners.", "... they literally said that lol", "Babe your arguing with the wrong person", "No I got that, no worries. I just confused quite a few other people on my gender I think, and now half the people here are just trying not to misgender me, which was not my intention lol. But hey, if there's anything good about this post, it's seeing our progress on inclusivity. :)", "I\u2019m a woman with longer hair. I think I bought my first hair dryer when I was in my 30s", "It's a hair dryer, not a straightener. I have a very short pixie cut that dries pretty much instantly with a towel, but his hair goes past his ears so he needs to dry it after a shower. And I do have a rug at the foot of the bed, I just didn't want to put two thinner ones next to it because it would be more difficult to keep things clean there. \n\nBut I see your point, and I find it somewhat funny that I come across as the more masculine one in this post lol."]}
