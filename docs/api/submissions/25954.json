Lately we started to spend more time in my apartment as it's closer to both of our workplaces, and my bf has been on my case about buying things for my place since the beginning. \n\nFirst he said 'we' should buy a rug for the bedroom, because he doesn't like wearing slippers and the floor is cold in the mornings. I told him he's welcome to bring a rug for his side. He didn't. \n\nThen he got annoyed that I don't have a hair dryer and he always needs to bring his own. I have very short hair so I never needed one, and I told him I'm not going to buy one that I'm not going to use. \n\nThen he started hinting that I should get a humidifier because the dry air hurts his throat. I didn't even acknowledge that one. \n\nThe last one was the coffee maker that I didn't have, because I don't drink coffee. He drinks a lot so I relented on that one, but I bought a pretty cheap one, which is apparently not good enough, and he said he might as well 'pour boiling water over a filter with a kettle' (he has a crazy expensive machine at his place). \n\nHe says it should be basic decency to want to make your guests feel more at home, especially your partner, and while I agree to some extent, I really can't afford to buy stuff I'm never going to use, especially since we're still very much in the beginning of our relationship, and we don't technically live together.

I do think that there is a fair amount of logic to his points.  I hate coffee and I have a Keurig w/ a dozen different coffee/cappucino pod etc options, b/c it is something most people have whether they prefer coffee or not, b/c people drink coffee. When someone stays over, or pops in on the weekends,  you offer them coffee.\n\nHair dryers and humidifiers are on the next level out.  I think eventually you will own all of these things.  The only way he'd have a better point is if you spend a lot on stuff all the time and you want him to come to yours (vs you going to his) all the time. It is difficult for someone to go to work, then come over, w/o having a drawer or whatever and stuff they use at your place.
