My grandma is actually my stepdad's mom, but her, my late grandpa and my stepdad's sister & nephews have always treated me like family since my mom & stepdad have been together since I was 3. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy step-dad's brother (50sM) and his wife who we'll call Bonnie (50sF) have always been weird with me. When I was little, I called her Aunt Bonnie and she responded, \"I'm not your aunt.\" When they got married, all of the little kids in the family were invited except me (I was the oldest child at that time). They bought me Christmas presents until I was 18 but, to this day, still buy presents for my cousins & sister (who are all adults). And, for some reason, Bonnie won't be my friend on Facebook. I added her years ago and she denied me. After my grandpa died last year I added her again (thinking we bonded over that week) and she denied me again. She's friends with members of my mom's family, but not with me. I was always a well behaved kid so I honestly don't know what her issue is. My mom just says, \"she's weird.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot gonna lie, it stings a bit, but I try not to let it get to me. Recently, I got engaged to my long term bf. At dinner tonight, the topic of my wedding came up and how I plan to get married in October. Bonnie mentioned how her family friend is getting married October \\[date\\] so to not scheduled mine that day. I said, \"Oh that's fine, I'm only having my family at my wedding anyway.\" She looked really taken aback. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy other aunt (stepdad's sister) said, \"I would have thought we were your family.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd, of course, I felt bad because she has always been so kind to me, so I immediately said, \"Oh, you are. She just won't even add me on Facebook.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy cousin, sensing tension, changed the subject but it was definitely awkward and Bonnie, her husband and kids left soon after. My mom said I was highly inappropriate and that this is going to upset grandma (who is deaf and didn't hear anything that happened). I said that I wasn't planning on inviting Bonnie & her husband to my wedding and she was going to find out eventually so why lie to them? I mean, why would I pay $90 a plate for someone who couldn't care less about me? Mom wants me to reach out and apologize but I am not really that sorry. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo . . . AITA?

Not only does she show blatant favoritism towards her blood and her blood only, she is reaping what she sowed. This lady fucked around and finded out the hard way.

One doesn\u2019t choose to exclude one niece when welcoming all the others for no reason.\n\nAssuming that you have got the correct measure of how all the cousins are treated (and not just making assumptions) - we still have no idea what that missing stair is. I\u2019m not sure you\u2019ll *ever* know - either you already do and don\u2019t want to tell us because you know you\u2019re partly responsible for the distance between you both, or you\u2019re inheriting some sort of issue. It actually makes me wonder if your aunt and your mom had some kind of beef. \n\nIF you had planned to invite your uncle, I\u2019d had said Y-T-A because it would be rude to exclude his partner.

And no one with an attitude problem should be empowered to bring their drama and their piss poor attitude and potentially ruin your day.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t get this shit about parents inviting their own people to their kids\u2019s wedding;  you already had a wedding.

Your wedding, your invite list!  My Aunt, my dad's SIL could be a very bitter woman.  My niece went to say goodbye and my aunt's response was, you never said hello, how can you say hello.

We JUST started planning and, honestly, am probably going to push it off to November because costs go down so much.", "At a guess, it's because OP is the stepdaughter, but the other kids are children of her stepdad and her mother. That's why Bonnie isn't a 'real aunt' to OP, because OP doesn't have her stepdad's family genes  (of course, neither does Bonnie, as she married into the family).", "My mom is the same way, though she has gotten a bit better over the years after I started calling her out on it. Once my MIL, after seeing my husband had lost weight, suggested to my mom that I probably wasn\u2019t taking good care of him, and my mom went OFF on her. Like really yelled at her, according to my sister (I forgave my MIL tho, her brother was shot and killed just a few months prior so she was not her usual self). But there are still moments where my mom just HATES family drama and would even try to pay us off to have us get along. It\u2019s crazy the lengths she would go to try and fix family issues.", "This is wild to me.\n\nMy mom also hates family drama, but her version is politely telling the older adults off when they forget their manners, sticking up for her kids, and making sure everyone knows theyre welcome and will have safe food to eat.\n\n...not throwing her kids under the bus for some rude ah."]}
