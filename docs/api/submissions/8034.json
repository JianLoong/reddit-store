Seems your skill is what kept it going", "INFO: He said he wanted to buy you out, you agreed to walk away with only a small amount of money leaving him everything else, and now you are upset about what you agreed to? Why did you not push for more money or just tell him no?", "NTA but you could have said \u2018No\u2019 to the buy out offer. Or was it a demand?  I do think your dad did you dirty. After you rest a while, I hope you come up with a different sideline business so successful your dad turns green with envy.", "NTA, but you shouldn\u2019t have let him have it so easily and for so little money. That part is on you. You should have just refused, or requested a lot of money for it.", "ESH. He did take advantage of you; to buy you out of that business for a small amount of money was completely inappropriate. But you're also TA because you accepted that small cheque. You're mad because you've realized that you undervalued yourself.\n\nAnd I get it. You're young and still used to assuming that your father has your best interests in mind. It does take a while to settle into a new relationship dynamic with your parents once you become an adult, and it can be a shock to see them through adult eyes and realize that these people can be AHs, even to their own kids. But that makes it especially important that you establish boundaries with your father now, and make it clearer that you regard yourself as his equal. Your business relationship with him is not the same thing as your personal relationship with him, and you shouldn't cross those streams. So if your father can't be bothered to keep in contact except if it's about the business, then **don't contact him**. If he contacts you about the business, then **do not answer his questions for free**. This is business! You already did him a favor by selling your share cheap! Answering his business questions is now a consultation. Tell him upfront that you now have hourly rates -- how much depends on how badly you feel like he screwed you, re the business -- and bill him anytime you have a lengthy convo about stuff that's now his sole responsibility. You don't work for him and you don't owe him anything. It doesn't have to be unfriendly, but it's \"just business.\" And if he wants a relationship with his adult son beyond that, he's going to need to put some effort into that, same way he invested in the business you built together.\n\nJust take the L on this, because you should've stood up for yourself. But make sure you do better going forward.", "NTA - realizing toxic traits of a family member is an OK reason to distance from them.", "YTA for not standing up for yourself. Grow a backbone.", "NTA. You took him into the business and once it was doing really well he wanted you out. I would go NC too.", "INFO why did you do yourself such a disservice? You didn\u2019t have to give it to him for so little or at all. Was he pressuring you or holding something over your head?", "NTA and you are seeing this with very clear vision.  What a horrible man.  Next time he asks for help with the business, send him an invoice that he must pay for your consulting.  Seriously.  He'll never admit it, but he stole considerable money, time, and energy from you.  He doesn't pay, he gets none of your expertise.  And I'm looking forward to your next business success -- well done for one so young.", "NTA but you should not have let him buy you out. You should have kept YOUR business and paid him.", "NTA you shouldn't be answering questions still on it. You shouldn't have walked away for a small amount. Grow a back bone.", "NTA honestly I would create your own business then compete with his just to be petty but I\u2019m an asshole honestly you don\u2019t need any part of that bullshit I wouldn\u2019t even answer his calls or if you do just tell him I\u2019m not a part of the business remember figure it out yourself you owe him nothing after you stole your business and it was your business not his", "Esh, why did you sell out?", "Nta, make a big stink on your local facebook and tell everyone of your customers what he did", "NTA. Contact your old costumers and let them know what happened. He can't take your business if there's no customers. What he did is morally bankrupt at best, and intentional cruel at worst. You started this business, your customers came back because of you, it was your back breaking work that made it happen. So take it all back and keep the machinery if it was purchased in your name or your business's name.", "You're admitting that you weren't spending enough time on the business while he was presumably doing more work than you were. In this situation it's not unreasonable that he asked to buy out your share.\n\nYou agreed to let him buy you out and you asked for almost nothing. And now you're unhappy.\n\nIt seems like a big part of your dissatisfaction is caused by your own decisions. You didn't have to agree to let him buy you out that easily and you could've asked for more. I don't know your father and I don't know the details of your business, etc, but to me this looks like a soft YTA.", "ESH. You feel screwed over because you were, but you let it happen. You could have refused his buyout offer. Yes, what he did sucks but, again, you agreed to it. I understand feeling resentment because it was your idea and you did all of the leg work to make it a profitable business. If you feel this situation is worth going NC with him, then that is your decision, but you are not free of blame for the situation you find yourself in now.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Standing at a distance and blaming a young victim for being scammed by his own parent is not kind or helpful.  Not many could have been so successful despite having an abusive father, and he's not a 40-something Wall Street executive or graduate of a business school with tons of experience dealing with dirty dealers like this AH of a \"father.\"  It's not so clear cut or cut and dried (yes, I'm using lumber metaphors) within family dynamics for someone just starting out.", "I think that the dad should not have been ok with the son leaving with almost nothing. The dad is possibly an asshole. But that's just an assumption and I'm going off of purely what OP said happened."]}
