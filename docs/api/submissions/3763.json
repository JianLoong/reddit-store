Your parents have four kids - not three adopted ones and a Center of the Universe.", "YTA\n\nPeople breaking promises doesn't gives us a free pass to be hurtful. Especially when it comes to telling our parents to their faces that our siblings should've never been adopted/born/conceived - that is a very hurtful thing to say to a parent. It's not a \"you did something wrong, so I'm allowed to say whatever to make you feel bad\" kind of deal. \n\nFurthermore, you shouldn't take anything out on your siblings. There are better ways to tell your parents that they hurt you by breaking their promise, without dragging your siblings into it.", "Well, yeah, YTA for saying that.\n\nYou feel your feelings, and that's fine. However, almost everyone who leaves for college...well, leaves for college. Families don't move to be close to them. Also, isn't your brother of the same age going to college too? It's unreasonable to expect a family to move to be close to you. Also, it's one year, and then you'd be in the same situation. So what you're asking for is just strange, even if it was promised at some point.\n\nTeenagers sometimes say horrible, hurtful things (the classic being \"I hate you\" to parents). Just apologize, say you didn't mean that, you love your siblings, but you're disappointed and feel he's breaking a promise. You can all move past this. Time to act a bit more mature.", "YTA...part of growing up and moving on is letting go of your parents. They do have to think about the rest of the family.  You're not the centre of the universe.", "I\u2019m so confused about the logic in that statement. You appeared to be upset about him prioritizing them over you, so wouldn\u2019t you say he should have never conceived you since he couldn\u2019t handle the responsibility? \n\nRegardless, either statement is terrible and unnecessary to say. Idk how it could be right in the moment. If you wanted him to know how you felt, you should have communicated how hurt you were by him breaking his promise. \n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nYou are upset, understandable, but it doesn't mean that you should.

The way I see it, the situation has drastically changed.\n\nHe travelled the world for long years, and he\u2019s older now.

Now he\u2019s at a turning point where he can decide not to move out again as he doesn\u2019t even have a job obligation. And the promise was done 2 years before this, so before COVID I guess.\n\nHonestly, they shouldn\u2019t have promised something so unreasonable. You can\u2019t expect to move all your family with you while you go to university. Especially just for a year. It\u2019s just normal life that you and your family get separated when you enter an university abroad. They come with you to get you settled and visit often and the other way around, but changing their kids school and country for that doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nESH.

Don't take it out on your siblings.", "I'm not on board with all the Y  T  A judgments.   This is normal sibling rivalry with a special situation.  You would be just as upset if your parents had three more biological kids after you and made the same promise and then broke it to give them the stability you never got.  You're not terrible, you don't hate your siblings.  And even though you're 18, you are not an adult - you are at an age where it is very typical to be mature and grown up one minute and the worst kind of childish teenager the next.

I'm guessing your 18m adopted brother will be attending a college or university in the area you all are currently, your parents really are AH for blindsiding you like that. Hopefully you'll still be able to pick university/colleges you applied for or be able to apply for a university or college close by so you aren't set off track for your education plans. \n\nAsk your parents: why they made this decision without letting you know till you brought it up? Would they choose to move if 18m or any of the other adopted siblings choose a college/university not close by? What are you supposed to do for housing the first year of college if you get accepted to the places you apply for?\n\nYour parents should have let you know your agreement changed, should have included you in the discussion where your adopted siblings said that they wanted to stay. Is this the first time your adopted siblings have been put first? Why don't your parents include you in family decisions? I'm really baffled by their preferential treatment for decision making and ho they didn't include you in a decision that would effect you. \n\nYou have every right to be upset, this decision effects what colleges you can apply to and what your major is (depending on what the colleges offer).", "YTA, it sucks that you were made to move around throughout your childhood, but it\u2019s perfectly normal for kids to be away from their families when they go to college. It\u2019s far more unusual for families to be nearby (unless the child attends a local university), it\u2019s the time for kids to discover themselves away from their family unit. \n\nI do feel for you though, to you it seems as if your siblings are getting more of the settled childhood you wanted. But, I do wonder if your parents are settling on a base that you can come home to- continually moving around whilst you are in college would make it harder for you to come \u2018home\u2019. \n\nYou were wrong to say that about your siblings, but I guess in a similar situation others might say their parents should never have had more biological kids- you were lashing out and because of the make-up of your family that\u2019s where it landed. It might be a good idea to apologise for your words and explain that it\u2019s more about the transient nature of your childhood and how it felt that your dads needs came before yours and now it feels like your siblings needs are coming before yours- perhaps then you guys can have a more constructive discussion about everything.", "Ok to clarify when you say \u201cstay where they are\u201d do you mean the schools they go to or a place you are all staying together. \n\nSorry I got a little lost I\u2019m multitasking\n\nAlso I\u2019m a little confusing as to why you\u2019d want to live with them now when you\u2019re not gonna be home regardless cuz of school", "Soft YTA. It was a mean thing to say and you said it purposefully to hurt him. But you are a teenager and were upset that your father broke an important promise. \n\nYour dad is the bigger AH though. Because he's blaming the not moving on your siblings, when he (and potentially your mother) have decided that being settled down is more pleasant than they expected and HE doesn't want to move. Rather than explain logically that the promise was made when everyone was used to moving a lot and enjoyed it. But that circumstances have changed and moving around as much just isn't something they really want to do anymore. And apologizing to you for making that promise about something so far in the future wasn't a good thing to do in the first place because you never know what the circumstances are going to be when the time gets here.", "Yta my siblings are adopted I count myself extremely lucky that I was blessed with such amazing siblings", "Nta, but you finally realized their priority, be it biological or not, you arent theirs.

If you are grown up enough to attend university,  you are grown up enough to do so without mommy and daddy being down the street.", "YTA.\n\n Circumstances change and therefore decisions and promises can't always hold up to the new circumstances. Please realise that. \n\nI can understand you are disappointed but if they were your blood related siblings this decision might have been the same.

Most of the wrong is on her parents to be sure, should OP have phrased it like she said, no? But if people adopt and have biological children at the same time they need to treat them equally, compromise where it's needed, and not cater about one more than the other. Honestly if there hadn't been an agreement between her and her parents then she would have been the AH, but there was and the parents made a decision that would effect her AND they didn't tell her till she brought it up.", "You've misinterpreted my reply, I meant the disrespect from OP. Obviously it was for health reasons, Can you imagine how disrespectful OP is to suggest that their mother shouldn't have adopted children when they're fully aware the mother was advised not to birth any more children.", "YTA your parents lives actually don\u2019t revolve around you. it\u2019s a shame they made that promise and broke it but 99% of people move alone when they go to college and they\u2019re just fine. it\u2019s\nnot the end of the world and you were out of line. if you\u2019re resentful of your father for not giving you a stable childhood then go to therapy or have a conversation with him about that instead of bringing your siblings into it", "YTA. If you can't live that far away from your parents for a year, you aren't ready to go away to college. If you need them to be close for your first year, either find a school close to where you are, or find an online option. It's unreasonable to expect your entire family to be uprooted so YOU can go to college, so E S H as far as having that even be a possible expectation, but for overall entitlement and arrogance (which, to be fair, comes with the territory for most 18yo's), YTA.", "YTA for what you said\u2014 you wish you were an only child, and that's fine to feel that way, but that's something you have to deal with internally. Your siblings are as much a part of the family as you are, and they deserve to have their wants and needs addressed too. In fact, moreso since two of them are still minors. \nI suspect your parents didn't \"promise\" but rather just said they would do something that they now no longer can do. Many 18-year olds move away from their parents for school \u2014 it's an opportunity for you to learn independence. It's okay to be upset with your parents right now, but it's not okay to place blame on your siblings.", "YTA\nThis was an unrealistic and unfair promise. It should have never been made.\n\nAnd i get you willing be scared to be on your own, you won't really be on your own. Your parents will always be there, a phone call a way.", "YTA. Plans change. They aren\u2019t laws, or commandments. They\u2019re plans. The PLAN was for your family Tim keep moving, move close to your university, then move one last time and settle. Then there was a thing in 2020 that ruined everyone\u2019s plans, and now, after being settled for a while, your siblings are happy, your parents are happy, and you will have to go to university some place local, or you\u2019ll have to go out on your own. You still have a phone, and you can still ask questions and get help. And there will be other students away from their families, same as you. You\u2019ll have to make friends, and figure things out. It\u2019ll be tough, but you\u2019ll grow. \n\nSaying your parents shouldn\u2019t have adopted kids because the plan since then and now has changed is like saying there\u2019s no point in you going to university because at some point an asteroid might hit the earth and make a degree pointless. You probably still want to go. \n\nApologize, tell your dad you were just frustrated and you didn\u2019t mean it. Then take a look at yourself and ask why it was so easy for you to be so casually cruel and selfish. \n\nYou can be better than this.", "People change, circumstances change, life changes. Just a fact.", "YTA, go to your dad now and apologize so profusely he won't know what to do. That argument is just BS, never ever bring that up ever again. Being their biological daughter does not give you special rights as you are aware of. So I understand you said it in the heat of the moment, but it was a big AH move! Go to him and make up!", "My eldest son is 22 and lives at home, on more than one occasion he has saif \"well you shouldnt have had more kids\" about his 2 youngest siblings (they have a different father than my 3 older ones). It always happens when i demand he help out more around the house and with his brothers (and yes demand, because he is a fully grown adult and he doesnt work and lives off his mommy and no he isnt in school either) so I demand because he needs to do SOMETHING  other than sit around playing video games, he needs to do something productive.  \nIts hurtful every time he says it and I just walk away and tell him to get away from me..\n\nOP YTA... they are your siblings", "YYA for the comment, they are your brothers the fact your parents make decisions based on 3 of their kids not a single one is rough since you are the odd man out, go to the university you want, what would stop you, do what you want", "YTA\n\nI feel like you need some therapy to get rid of your deep hate that your parents adopted . Your blood connection is the same as their adopted connection to your parents . Being their only biological child doesn\u2019t mean everyone does what you want because you don\u2019t want to be alone you\u2019re freshman year of college .", "YTA. The world does not revolve around you just because you share DNA with them. \n\nWhat I think you meant to say was that everything was great until you were no longer getting your way. I don\u2019t think you should move away for college because you\u2019re clearly not mature enough to do so.", "I have an adopted child and, WHEW, I\u2019ll tell you *what*, if one of her siblings ever said anything remotely like this it would take a LOOOOOOONNNNNGGGGGGG time before I could look at that child the same way agin. \n\nThe first thing out of my mouth would have been ugly, too. My kids do N.O.T. get to share their opinions on *my* reproductive choices- just like I don\u2019t get to share my opinions on theirs. \n\nYour dad handled it better than me, I promise you that. Your dad is N T A but YTA- and I would be a major asshole if any of my children ever dared.", "YTA. What an awful ungrateful daughter you are.", "YTA and you already admitted that you know it in your post.  This is just an attempt to find people who support you, which appears to have not worked. You are not entitled to have your entire family relocate for your comfort. Not only was that a dumb promise to make, it's outrageously selfish and manipulative to even ask for it and especially to get mad when it doesn't occur.", "YTA, they're your siblings now.  In any case, it's weird to think that you'd simply bring your parents to college.  They're also perfectly allowed to decide that they're done moving around and wish to continue living where they are.", "YTH and your dad was an idiot for telling you he would uproot the entire household to live near you in your first year in college.\nYour first year in college is super busy. You will be meeting new people and adjusting to a whole different way of learning. (Less hours in class but more hours doing homework). Unless you lived with them, it would be difficult to spend much time with them. Seems you have two choices-either find a school close to home or go away and do some growing up. Either way, you need to apologize to your dad for your callous words about your siblings.", "ESH / NAH your logic is baffling", "You say that but the dynamic of families that have an adopted child is different. \n\nActually saying this is akin to stabbing a sibling in the heart. The actual audacity to throw that in an adopted child\u2019s face is unconscionable. \n\nSibling rivalry is one thing but throwing around the idea that *you* are better bc you weren\u2019t adopted is totally different. \n\nPart of OP thinks it or they wouldn\u2019t have said it. \n\nIt\u2019s a BIG fucking deal. Huge.", "This is the most entitled attitude I've heard on Reddit lol. Many children are promised many things they do not receive. It is not a reason to say you wish your sibling didn't exist. It's extreme entitlement and selfishness. This girl is learning a lesson I guess her parents never taught her. The world doesn't fucking revolve around you.", "Not having her family follow her across the planet to live nearby when she's in uni is a FAR cry from abuse.", "The idea of the 'squeaky wheel gets the grease' is sort of why we have so many full grown adults throwing tantrums.  They are getting the grease because it is just easier for people to give into them, not because they are correct or their feelings are valid.\n\nYou are allowed to communicate your feelings and clarify your boundaries.  If someone fucks up and isn't willing to talk about it, then you have a decision to make.  Is this fuck up something you cannot deal with - especially if it is about something that may continue to happen?  if so, then use, cutting that person off may be the way to go.  For example, if OP continued to throw this tantrum, that only her feelings are valid, then I think it is appropriate for her family to back up from her.  If she isn't willing to appreciate how this would affect everyone (moving for 1 person), if she isn't willing to sit down and discuss options, then what is the point of having further conversations?\n\nIf this fuck up is something you can deal with - it is a small issue that the other person cannot or will not empathize with you or at least understand your feelings - then you do just process your feelings and move forward.  Find a therapist to speak with, do self-care, or whatever needs to happen.\n\nThere is no reason for a full grown adult to throw a tantrum, nor for anyone to suffer internally.  Be your own advocate, using real words and being calm and direct.  If the other person isn't willing to listen, that means you make a decision about what is best for you.", "Holy shit if you think that this situation is someone really being mistreated then I\u2019ve got some major news about the real world for you", "i did say i was reflecting about my life based on ops post\n\nsorry for any confusion as you're not the only one to interpret it like that"]}
