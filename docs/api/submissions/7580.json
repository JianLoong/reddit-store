I understand requesting it, but once the answer was no, there are still other methods you can use to balance the playing field here. As the eldest, I provided for my brother when we were left alone. There are plenty of chores he can do to thank you for cooking. I never had to do any dishes when our parents were gone, because that was my usual price. If he had requests, I would give him some other task to do as well. One time I had to run to the grocery store to fulfill a request of his and I really didn't want to, so I told him if he wanted it, he had to clean the bathroom. Just because your parents aren't willing to pay you, doesn't mean you can't negotiate something with your brother. You would be doing something for him, he should reciprocate.\n\nI also see a lot of people on this post telling you that your parents are sexist. That may very well be true. But you should be thankful that, in their ignorance, they gave you a skill that will serve you well for the rest of your life, while they let your brother flail about with the microwave. He's going to struggle with that for a long time. That being said, holding his inability to cook against him will not do anyone any good in this situation. It will only cause resentment between the two of you, so unless that is already something you deal with, I would suggest finding another way to resolve this. It's not his fault, it is your parent's fault.\n\nBut finally, if he refuses to reciprocate in any way, then don't cook for him. It will prepare him for when he has to move out on his own. We should do things to help our family, but that bond goes both ways, and if he's not willing to meet you halfway, then that's too bad for him.", "Yeah the parents are the only AH in this situation.

That's the mature approach to a sticky situation. I feel sorry for anyone he will go on to live with if he can't even clean dishes properly...", "Nice...I like where this is going.\n\nOP, you can make huge vat of [\"shit on a shingle\"!](https://www.aspicyperspective.com/creamed-chipped-beef-on-toast-shit-on-a-shingle/)\n\nSuper simple, keeps for days, easy heat up that even your brother can do.", "Oh, I can see some possibilities here.\n\nLike making food he doesn\u2019t really care for. Not stuff he hates, that would be too obvious. But if he prefers pasta, give him rice or potatoes, for example.\n\nOr give him the same food over and over again. Make a big casserole and have that for dinner 3-4 nights running. Sandwiches every day for lunch. The same breakfast every day.", "NTA\n\nTHIS!!  I wish my parents had taught me to cook, I'm female and my mom didn't really cook, it's such a usefully skill!! I'm better now but thought you could cook in a microwave for a few years. OP feed yourself and offer to make him food if he helps you cook, no more excuses he can't cook.", "Youtube could be his friend here if he cares.", "2 is quite risky. He could agree to it and not do it, or not well enough.", "Even If he can't cook he prob can use a microwave, head up something and get over it XD", "Came here to say this. In our house, whoever cooks gets to watch the others clean.", "I hate washing up so much (I love cooking however, obviously the dishwasher is used alot!) But this is the best compromise, I don't feel it's necessarily a winnable battle bringing money into it, the parents could then start saying X costs Y and it just spirals into petty behaviour.", "Two teenagers will be fine on their own for a week", "He can eat toast, I'd do the same, and I am a lot older than the OP!!", "he\u2019s awful at doing the dishes if that\u2019s even possible. whenever our parents force him to he always puts plates and cups that are clearly dirty back into the cupboard\n\ni rather eat gross food than do all of the work for none of the reward yk", "WTF?\n\nthe brother can cook for himself.  ramen noodles are easy", "What\u2026? Her parents are literally being sexist by letting the brother not have to learn to cook but making the female provide for the useless boy. Why would op care if their parents don\u2019t leave them alone again..? Less work on op all way around. NTA.", "Found the shitty excuse for a parent.", "This is the only correct answer.  For a week with parents away, I'd agree to whatever they said... \n\n\"What's that mom, You want me to follow big brother around with a trumpet, and announce his royal entry everywhere he goes?  Sure mom, have a great trip!\"\n\n(then I'd let him starve while I had a week long party)", "That's some ridiculous logic there", "Lol, no woman will stay with this babied mama's boy for long. If I were OP, I would WARN any girl he brings home. \n\nWhat's gonna happen when he has to move out? What else CANT he do? Laundry? Cleaning his room? Dishes? What are HIS chores compared to hers?", "Honestly I feel that the mature approach would be every man for himself. Each sibling cook and eat for themselves", "If she does that, then she\u2019s still responsible for 100% of her own meals, while the brother is only responsible for 50% of his meals. A mature solution would be a fair solution, which this suggestion is not.", "I don't know what that kid hates, but if I were cooking stuff to punish myself every dish would have the words \"Brussel Sprouts\" in it.", "It seems to me it would take extra skill to be able to cook anything decent in a microwave.", "2 can easily turn back into 1.", "Sounds like he's just a lazy asshole", "Weaponized incompetence. They taught your brother to be a crap adult. This is how he will treat future partners.", "Well don't underestimate how clueless people can be in the kitchen. Even ramen noodles can be intimidating if you've never tried it. And I'm sure the parents don't want their son eating ramen noodles all week - they want to feel confident that he's eating well. (In reality, the brother could do McDonalds or Pizza all week ; the parents don't need to know all the details.) Bottom line, it's in OP's best interest not to rock the boat at this point.", "The issue here isn't about what happened over the past 5 years and whether or not the boy should have been taught how to cook. I'm looking at where OP stands right now. Her brother can't cook. Maybe after a week of relying on his sister he might realize he wants to learn some of the basics. But right now, OP has a golden opportunity to prove how responsible she is and instead she's trying to shoot herself in the foot. This is not the moment to take the moral high ground - she can do it after her parents come back from vacation.\n\nAs for \"why would OP care if their parents don't leave them alone again?\" Seriously? Do you remember being 15? Having parents go away was like the greatest thing that could happen to a teen.", "I make no claims that this is good parental advice. I'm saying this is \"how to play your parents to get more of what you want\" advice.\n\nYour parents want to leave you alone in the house for an entire week and they want you to do X, Y, and Z? You say \"yes ma'am.\"", "This is how I\u2019d play it if the parents still insist. Starve him. He\u2019s 16 and perfectly capable of making basic meals.", "It\u2019s a joke", "Let\u2019s be honest he won\u2019t move out because mommy hasn\u2019t given birth to him yet", "I don't disagree, but, it doesn't take a lot of skill to \\*reheat\\* things in a microwave. Parents are only gone for a week, I don't see why they couldn't have planned ahead to provide poor helpless can't-cook 16m with a few microwave-reheatable meals.", "Sounds like a good time for him to learn then, trial by fire", "yup\n\n\"whatcha gonna do, tell mom?  She'll be here in a week, you can eat then.\"", "Exactly... Siblings have their own dynamics and they'll figure out the meal situation on their own. If OP doesn't cook for her brother, bro could snitch - but if he's smart he won't because then he risks not being left alone in the future as well.", "I just spit my coffee. Cleanup on aisle 1. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 take my poor mans gold for that. \ud83e\udd47", "I'm entirely with you, he's a helpless baby. I was talking about actual cooking, like raw ingredients, not heating up an already cooked dish.", "Absolutely! And I have no problem with OP forcing him to learn something while the parents are away. I just don't think OP should demand to be paid - she's already being \"paid\" with a parent-free week."]}
