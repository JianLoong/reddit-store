I understand requesting it, but once the answer was no, there are still other methods you can use to balance the playing field here. As the eldest, I provided for my brother when we were left alone. There are plenty of chores he can do to thank you for cooking. I never had to do any dishes when our parents were gone, because that was my usual price. If he had requests, I would give him some other task to do as well. One time I had to run to the grocery store to fulfill a request of his and I really didn't want to, so I told him if he wanted it, he had to clean the bathroom. Just because your parents aren't willing to pay you, doesn't mean you can't negotiate something with your brother. You would be doing something for him, he should reciprocate.\n\nI also see a lot of people on this post telling you that your parents are sexist. That may very well be true. But you should be thankful that, in their ignorance, they gave you a skill that will serve you well for the rest of your life, while they let your brother flail about with the microwave. He's going to struggle with that for a long time. That being said, holding his inability to cook against him will not do anyone any good in this situation. It will only cause resentment between the two of you, so unless that is already something you deal with, I would suggest finding another way to resolve this. It's not his fault, it is your parent's fault.\n\nBut finally, if he refuses to reciprocate in any way, then don't cook for him. It will prepare him for when he has to move out on his own. We should do things to help our family, but that bond goes both ways, and if he's not willing to meet you halfway, then that's too bad for him.", "Yeah the parents are the only AH in this situation.
