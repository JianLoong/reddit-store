She leaves the day you get back.  She packs her stuff, everything she can pack within a few hours.  After that, your husband will pack the rest and drop it off at the parents house.  Change locks, put up security cameras and that is it.  She is selfishly cruel, a liar and not trustworthy to follow through on her commitments.  You don\u2019t need that in your home.

I do feel sorry for her doggie however.", "For all the downvotes, my opinion is if you have to ask if You\u2019re TA for kicking someone out for abusing your pets, I will take the negativity. You need to stand up for your fur babies."]}
