Discussion!  You say you are not the rule enforcer. Well, your dog can\u2019t be, so you need to be.", "She hates animals. She is an animal abuser. She deserves things I cannot say here. KICK. HER. ASSHOLE. TO. THE. CURB.", "It's not your job to raise your young adult sister-in-law.\n\nThat was her parents' job and they fucked it up.", "A decent human being living in someone else's house would not have to have rules enforced , they would simply do as they were asked.  I stayed with a friend as my divorce was going thru the process.  my friend told me she wanted me home by 10 pm.  We were both teachers and a good night's sleep was critical.  I did as she asked.  Could you live with yourself if you let her stay and as a result of her neglect one of your dogs got sick or ran away from hime and died. You are not an AH. kt kt", "Not a rule enforcer equals doormat.  \nYou are doing this to yourself", "It\u2019s too late to enforce rules. This girl will just walk all over whatever you try to do. Let her learn life lessons the hard way since the soft way won\u2019t work. Your pets safety and health are now your only concern.", "I don\u2019t think, at this point, enforcing rules is going to help. She clearly can\u2019t follow basic rules (that she should\u2019ve done on her own) and then went out of her way to harm your animals. To me that\u2019s beyond irresponsible and I don\u2019t think I could trust having her in my home any longer. That\u2019s so messed up to do to those poor dogs. \n\nYour husband should\u2019ve set firm boundaries and I think he should be the one to let her know she needs to pack up and move. Maybe she\u2019ll learn to be more responsible at her next place.", "You need to kick her out. You can't trust her around your animals or your child. Change the locks.", "If you ignore her behavior, it will only get worse.  Kick her out for everyone's benefit.  Maybe she will learn that actions have consequences .  ?/////you do everyone a disservice by letting her live with you after that vile behavior.  kt", "Thank you!!! This a thousand times over. One good thing Florida did, not only is it a crime but it\u2019s now a felony here!", "Tomato, tomato", "She also gave OP the story about the dog food, which wasn't true, to get money off her to go to the other town.  She's lying and stealing, to boot.", "Talking things through doesn't work with her.\n\nCheck lists won't work with her.\n\nShe'll just say \"Yes\" and do whatever the hell she wants to do.\n\nKick her out.", "Yeah what would\u2019ve happened had the neighbor not said anything?!?!", "She\u2019s past the point of being parented, just be rid of her.", "Please do an update we\u2019re you tell us you kicked her out", "NTA.  Her bags and stuff would be on the curb if she doesn't leave immediately. Change the locks and never let her in your house again. She would also reimburse me for any cleaning that had to be done, dog sitter,  and vet bills if your golden gets sick. She is an adult not a child. She abused your animals. Do not give her another chance.", "Having two adopted puppers that are the light of my day and get all the love and  attention even when they're being pains, it makes me so sad that anyone could just casually abandon and neglect dogs like this, especially in their own home. You are NTA, and she needs some really hard life lessons.", "I would never have let her move in after you asked her to have her dog neutered and microchiped and she failed to do so, but still moved in.\n\nI'd pack her shit and have it sitting on the porch or the front lawn, hopefully it pours", "NTA\n\nGo go go and get that animal abuser out! Pack her stuff, put it in boxes at the front door and change the locks. Let her grab her stuff and then never let her back in.\n\nI am so freaking sorry this happened to your furbabes. No animal deserves that.", "Nta. She's can't be trusted. Gotta go", "NTA, she has no respect for you, your home or your animals. Kick her out.", "OP, you're not this person's mom. She's not your responsibility. If it's this bad already, it's just going to get worse. People will be mad at you no matter what, so just pull the trigger now.", "Get her out of your house before she becomes a legal tenant. Then your dogs could be in danger.", "Fuck no.\n\nKick. Her. Ass. Out.\n\nPronto.", "Seriously? She almost killed your dogs. You realize they didn\u2019t eat or drink for 2 days right? Put your foot down finally and give her some consequences. Kick her out and send her to grandma\u2019s.", "Unless you want more harm to come to your dogs and your house, you need to set hard boundaries and enforce rules better. You should definitely kick her out as this incident is a never event and I wouldnt have het in my home after this.", "Not if you kick her out. She is an adult who doesn't seem to care about pulling her weight or abiding by agreements. So why should you let her live with you? \n\nThe dogs outside while going to another city when she was meant to mind them is enough. Add the other stuff and you have complete justification and would be an idiot to let her stay.", "\u201cbut the issue is it\u2019s not my job to parent her\u201d you don\u2019t need to parent her, you need to Adult her. She is an adult and she needs to act like one and accept the consequences  of her actions to several helpless animals.   You need to grow some ovaries, because apparently no one in your household have any gonads. It\u2019s time to say  Bye Felicia!", "You say to her \" I said you were welcome to stay in my house as long as you followed certain house rules. Those have been completely ignored. On top of that you have abused and neglected my dogs without even giving me a head up and then disappeared and been unreachable, leading husband and myself to worry about your safety when you were perfectly fine. Due to all this you are not welcome to return to live in my home any longer.\" That is not parenting but setting boundaries and expectations.", "What she deserves is for you to stuff all her crap into a suitcase and leave it outside the door to your house.\n\nDon't even let her in.\n\nWhat she did was despicable, and a criminal level of neglect.\n\nNTA OP.", "NTA. She wouldn\u2019t set foot in my house again if she left my dogs like that.", "NTA - do not let this woman back in your house. Box her stuff up and put it outside for 2 days.", "erm", "Nta - and why are you under reacting? If this happened to my dogs her stuff would be out in the rain", "nah we don't give fifth chances to animal abusers, nta. send her somewhere where there are no pets.", "Yeah you definitely have a husband problem.", "Get her out. This will only get worse. This is how people wake up two years down the road and wonder how on earth they let things get this bad.  NTA", "You should have enforced the rules before. Now it is too late, she did too much wrong, she has to leave."]}
