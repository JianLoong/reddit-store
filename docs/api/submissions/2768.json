I asked him to come back and help me. He lost it. He quietly and repeatedly told me to \u201cgo f&$* myself and to shut the f&$* up\u201d. He did then get up and storm out of the room.

He decided to not only act as if you were his mom scolding you for chores but treat you like a concubine. What the heck man...", "NTA and I'd think twice about hosting a party for your husband's family again. I cannot even imagine my husband not helping with his family event, let alone talking to me like that. Did he even tell you he felt sick before he flipped out?", "NTA. That's emotional abuse, pure and simple, and you can't put up with it or it will get worse. It might even morph into something much more serious. You need to explore your options now. Your husband does not respect you, and is treating you worse than a servant.", "NTA But seriously you need to run before you have kids with a man who tells you to shut the F#@k up. He will be even more cruel to any child you might have.", "NTA.  But you are by accepting him to talk to you like that.  2 card him.", "This is so bizarre. He eats too much and that gives him a free pass to leave an event he's hosting? Its HIS mother's party too. For him to think k its appropriate to hide away with no excuse, then talk to you like that, is unreal. Absolutely NTA and you both need to have a serious conversation. My guess is this isn't the first or last time he treats you like that.", "NTA but why are you tolerating this?", "NTA.  He\u2019s got some self control issues if he\u2019s consistently eating so much food at family functions that it makes him feel ill.  Since he knows that he feels sick after eating so much, he needed to set limit for himself on how much food to eat.  \n\nEven if he was genuinely sick, there\u2019s no excuse for the way he spoke to you.  You were right to ask him for help because bottom line is he needed to be of more assistance, especially since this party was for HIS mother.  Next time you host a dinner party for someone close to him, have him take the reins and you be the one to relax and be hands off.", "NTA and how sick could he be if he still has enough energy to abuse you like that? Guy needs some serious help.", "NTA. Honestly, I\u2019d hire a divorce lawyer now.", "NTA But I would be handing him divorce papers instead of trying to negotiate with an abusive adult who has tantrums", "NTA. If he was really sick, all he had to do was tell you he was too nauseous to move or give a similar suitable explanation. There was no need for him to be abusive towards you.", "NTA.  Sounds like your hubby has been using this excuse for years to get out of things that he doesn't want to be part of.  Maybe he needs to grow up.", "I would have walked out of the house at that point. Absolutely uncalled for. NTA", "I N F O - Did he tell anyone he was feeling sick when he disappeared?", "NTA \n\nBut your husband is one. A big one.", "Some serious communication restructuring needs to happen, RIGHT NOW. \n\nNo one gets to say \"eff off\" in a healthy relationship. Fight? Of course. Raise voices? Sure. Maybe even some temper slips. But that behavior is entirely disrespectful, and it is IRRELEVANT whether he was \"sick\" or not. \n\n(The whole \"sick\" thing is a different issue ALTOGETHER, but we're focusing here, so...)\n\nDo not accept this behavior even a moment longer.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. \n\nI don't even buy it that he didn't feel well. His reaction was way bigger than that. It strikes me that he may have been doing something he knew he shouldn't have been doing while \"browsing on his phone\" and freaked out that he almost got caught.", "NTA, I hope this is just for karma & you know his actions are inexcusable. If not, I hope the many responses can convince you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

At  the very least I would discuss with his mom and get her opinion.", "Eh. Does it matter? Its an obvious NTA. But will a hundred internet strangers make that mean anything? You deserve better. I hope you find your way", "NTA. What he said to you is completely unacceptable. Don\u2019t let him get away with that abuse.", "ESH \n\nSad man married the wrong woman. Shes completely entitled and makes me do this do that do this do that. Not a moment's break at all even at home. Awful life.\n\nHis response? equally awful.

But you are right, it is inexcusable.", "Either female in a relationship with a male, or woman in relationship with a man. Not man and female. It sounds degrading and misogynistic.", "The world is full of them.", "NTA.\n\nAlso why are you in a relationship with a man who treats you as a housekeeper?\n\nYou are focusing on the wrong things. He verbally abused you. He expects you to clean, cook, host HIS FAMILY. \n\nLike what does he contribute to the relationship? And your answer better not be financially- because in that case you would be considered financially abuse if you are financially reliant on him.\n\nNTA, but seriously re-evaluate your relationship and what you deserve.", "NTA--what on earth was he expecting?? Good grief. He sounds like a miserable, manipulative person. If you can, you should leave him. I doubt he's going to be less of a jerk in the future.", "I'm sorry you have to deal with that.", "NTA. But you may want to consider having a boundary established on how he speaks to you even if he feels like crap. This is not acceptable in the slightest. Both mu husband and I suffer from chronic medical conditions, even on the days one of us feels like we're dying, we never speak to each other this way."]}
