He decided to not only act as if you were his mom scolding you for chores but treat you like a concubine. What the heck man...", "NTA and I'd think twice about hosting a party for your husband's family again. I cannot even imagine my husband not helping with his family event, let alone talking to me like that. Did he even tell you he felt sick before he flipped out?", "NTA. That's emotional abuse, pure and simple, and you can't put up with it or it will get worse. It might even morph into something much more serious. You need to explore your options now. Your husband does not respect you, and is treating you worse than a servant.", "NTA But seriously you need to run before you have kids with a man who tells you to shut the F#@k up. He will be even more cruel to any child you might have.", "NTA.  But you are by accepting him to talk to you like that.  2 card him.", "This is so bizarre. He eats too much and that gives him a free pass to leave an event he's hosting? Its HIS mother's party too. For him to think k its appropriate to hide away with no excuse, then talk to you like that, is unreal. Absolutely NTA and you both need to have a serious conversation. My guess is this isn't the first or last time he treats you like that.", "NTA but why are you tolerating this?", "NTA.  He\u2019s got some self control issues if he\u2019s consistently eating so much food at family functions that it makes him feel ill.  Since he knows that he feels sick after eating so much, he needed to set limit for himself on how much food to eat.  \n\nEven if he was genuinely sick, there\u2019s no excuse for the way he spoke to you.  You were right to ask him for help because bottom line is he needed to be of more assistance, especially since this party was for HIS mother.  Next time you host a dinner party for someone close to him, have him take the reins and you be the one to relax and be hands off.", "NTA and how sick could he be if he still has enough energy to abuse you like that? Guy needs some serious help.", "NTA. Honestly, I\u2019d hire a divorce lawyer now.", "NTA But I would be handing him divorce papers instead of trying to negotiate with an abusive adult who has tantrums", "NTA. If he was really sick, all he had to do was tell you he was too nauseous to move or give a similar suitable explanation. There was no need for him to be abusive towards you.", "NTA.  Sounds like your hubby has been using this excuse for years to get out of things that he doesn't want to be part of.  Maybe he needs to grow up.", "I would have walked out of the house at that point. Absolutely uncalled for. NTA", "I N F O - Did he tell anyone he was feeling sick when he disappeared?", "NTA \n\nBut your husband is one. A big one.", "Some serious communication restructuring needs to happen, RIGHT NOW. \n\nNo one gets to say \"eff off\" in a healthy relationship. Fight? Of course. Raise voices? Sure. Maybe even some temper slips. But that behavior is entirely disrespectful, and it is IRRELEVANT whether he was \"sick\" or not. \n\n(The whole \"sick\" thing is a different issue ALTOGETHER, but we're focusing here, so...)\n\nDo not accept this behavior even a moment longer.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. \n\nI don't even buy it that he didn't feel well.

His reaction sounds like you caught him doing something. Could he he cheating on you? Degrading a spouse and lashing out are signs of a cheater in my experience. \n\nA living husband does not diesel to his wife like that. It\u2019s egregious, demeaning, and hateful. You got a big problem.", "WHAT THE ABSOLUTE HELL?!?!?  You do everything for his Mother\u2019s event. He acts like child because you ask him to help and you\u2019re asking if YTA?!?!\n\nYou need to completely reevaluate your views on your own self-worth and your relationship.", "Why was he in another room during a party for his own mother? And do you know that he was just browsing on his phone? Sounds more like he overreacted so horribly because he was doing something he shouldn't have on his phone and you interrupted.", "NTA.\n\nI really don't approve of this \"husband\" for you. Thinking there's a considerate adult out in the world who would host his own mother.\n\n>Before we got married every family event my husband would eat what he says is way too much and then would disappear to lay down and (his words) \u201cdigest\u201d.\n\nThe behavior of a child who does not want to help.", "NTA. I hate it when it's assumed that the woman takes over all hosting duties. It wasn't even for your own mom! Please decline any duties that should be his. What an ungrateful...", "NTA. You need to talk to him about his immature, aqful treatment of you, and consider making him an ex if he isn't willing to discuss it properly. I would never ever treat my wife like this.", ">I just can\u2019t decide if I should have left him to lay down since he wasn\u2019t feeling well.\n\nGiven he didn't communicate this I don't know how you could have known.\n\nAlso, how sick?  Like deep in the throws of a flu?  Or just a head ache or tummy ache, I mean people power through head aches and tummy aches all the time.  It's hard to imagine a deep seated illness set in that quickly.", "That would be the last thing he would say to me, if that was my husband.  I\u2019d be out the door quick af, googling divorce attorneys.  \u201cMy tummy is too full\u201d is not an excuse to verbally abuse your spouse.  NTA.", "Nta \n\nThink hard if this is what you want to go through every year whenever you have to host a party.", "Gotta ask this as well. If my husband said either of these things to me I\u2019d nope right out of there. Let alone at the same time.", "I suspect he is never sick, just introverted. If he \u201cescapes\u201d at every party, likely there is a point where he gets overwhelmed. He clearly does not have the self-awareness to realize this about himself.\n\nOP, you should say, \u201cHusband, you disappear at every party we\u2019ve ever been to, leaving me to host. It\u2019s clear your get overwhelmed by parties and can\u2019t handle them at your house. We aren\u2019t going to host parties as a couple anymore.\u201d", "Kick in the balls.", "So your just fucking lazy? Do her a favor and divorce, oh right than who would be your mommy who you can also kiss and fuck"]}
