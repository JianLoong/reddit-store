He decided to not only act as if you were his mom scolding you for chores but treat you like a concubine. What the heck man...", "NTA and I'd think twice about hosting a party for your husband's family again. I cannot even imagine my husband not helping with his family event, let alone talking to me like that. Did he even tell you he felt sick before he flipped out?", "NTA. That's emotional abuse, pure and simple, and you can't put up with it or it will get worse. It might even morph into something much more serious. You need to explore your options now. Your husband does not respect you, and is treating you worse than a servant.", "NTA But seriously you need to run before you have kids with a man who tells you to shut the F#@k up. He will be even more cruel to any child you might have.", "NTA.  But you are by accepting him to talk to you like that.  2 card him.", "This is so bizarre. He eats too much and that gives him a free pass to leave an event he's hosting? Its HIS mother's party too. For him to think k its appropriate to hide away with no excuse, then talk to you like that, is unreal. Absolutely NTA and you both need to have a serious conversation. My guess is this isn't the first or last time he treats you like that.", "NTA but why are you tolerating this?", "NTA.  He\u2019s got some self control issues if he\u2019s consistently eating so much food at family functions that it makes him feel ill.  Since he knows that he feels sick after eating so much, he needed to set limit for himself on how much food to eat.  \n\nEven if he was genuinely sick, there\u2019s no excuse for the way he spoke to you.  You were right to ask him for help because bottom line is he needed to be of more assistance, especially since this party was for HIS mother.  Next time you host a dinner party for someone close to him, have him take the reins and you be the one to relax and be hands off.", "NTA and how sick could he be if he still has enough energy to abuse you like that? Guy needs some serious help.", "NTA. Honestly, I\u2019d hire a divorce lawyer now.", "NTA But I would be handing him divorce papers instead of trying to negotiate with an abusive adult who has tantrums", "NTA. If he was really sick, all he had to do was tell you he was too nauseous to move or give a similar suitable explanation. There was no need for him to be abusive towards you.", "NTA.  Sounds like your hubby has been using this excuse for years to get out of things that he doesn't want to be part of.  Maybe he needs to grow up.", "I would have walked out of the house at that point. Absolutely uncalled for. NTA", "I N F O - Did he tell anyone he was feeling sick when he disappeared?", "NTA \n\nBut your husband is one. A big one.", "Some serious communication restructuring needs to happen, RIGHT NOW. \n\nNo one gets to say \"eff off\" in a healthy relationship. Fight? Of course. Raise voices? Sure. Maybe even some temper slips. But that behavior is entirely disrespectful, and it is IRRELEVANT whether he was \"sick\" or not. \n\n(The whole \"sick\" thing is a different issue ALTOGETHER, but we're focusing here, so...)\n\nDo not accept this behavior even a moment longer.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. \n\nI don't even buy it that he didn't feel well.

It strikes me that he may have been doing something he knew he shouldn't have been doing while \"browsing on his phone\" and freaked out that he almost got caught.", "NTA, I hope this is just for karma & you know his actions are inexcusable.

To my knowledge the divorce attorney has not been retained yet. I will let you all know when or if that happens. \n\nYeah, I am probably generally the asshole here and in a lot of marital situations (at least I can admit that). However, I\u2019m not cheating and I wasn\u2019t simply gorging myself. I ate no more than I usually eat. Something legitimately was not sitting well and I still feel awful 11 hours after eating. I was not on my phone texting my \u201cside piece\u201d so sorry to disappoint you all with a lack of salaciousness. \n\nThere are also some facts missing from my wife\u2019s OP.  Did she mention I was laying down for at the most 5 minutes? Because it was 5 minutes, tops. She came in and said ARE YOU KIDDING ME? as if there was no conceivable reason I could or should be laying down. She didn\u2019t ask what the matter was.

To be clear though, I\u2019m not justifying my behaviour but simply explaining from a factual perspective that it was 3 times. Not repeatedly.  \n\nIn any case, you have all done a good job reminding me that I\u2019m an asshole.  I want to be a better man, I really do. My mouth gets carried away. It is a very big problem. \n\nI love my wife dearly though; I work very hard to provide her everything she could ever want or desire and I try my best. \n\nFriday night, for example, I had a nice warm home cooked candle lit meal with red wine ready for my wife for when she came home from getting her hair done. \n\nBut I\u2019m an asshole and obviously she should divorce me yesterday.", "Lol false.", "Sorry to disappoint.
