Most people move after they saw the note, and I am grateful for that.\n\nHowever,  there has been 2 teslas (of course it's tesla) that constantly park at my spot, I left a note first time when I saw them at my spot politely asking them to move. Couple days later they came back again and I left a note again asking them to move. After about 3 times I've had enough because at this point they are doing this on purpose. Last night they were at my spot again, so I left a note on one of the Teslas saying if I see them at my spot again I will tow them. \n\nThey found my number through the note I left on my car, and texted me last night saying I was threatening them. The person who texted me said that she's the friend of the other tesla which leads me to believe that they are doing this on purpose trading off my parking spot just to annoy me. I told them I kindly asked them to move several times and they kept coming back, and saying I was being rude and threatening them and causing them anxiety by asking them to move their ass away from my spot. \n\nAt this point I gave up arguing with them and I said if yall really like my spot just take it I don't care anymore. Today I went downstairs to check if they did something to my car and I found a note saying that they had me on sentry mode and told me to not touch their cars again.  \n\nAm I the asshole for leaving the note telling them I'll tow them?", "created_utc": 1696197006, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16xe1ch/aita_wanting_to_tow_someone_thats_been_in_my/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I doubt they are gonna do anything because the management is terrible and they don't want to deal with this. They said people can park at any available spots for now but I also have the right to ask them to move.", ">No notes, go directly to towing. \n\nExcept\u2026the last note OP left kind of gave permission to park in the spot. Sadly, the Teslas will probably hold onto the note in case something happens, so they can claim \u201cpermission.\u201d \n\nWith that in mind, i would leave one more note, or better yet, a huge sign (and take a photo of it) saying the next time someone parks there, you will have the car towed. \nAnd then do it. For reals!", "> They said people can park at any available spots for now but I also have the right to ask them to move.\n\nYou can *ask* them to move but it's not actually clear if they have to move when asked, though.\n\nI agree, your building management is bad.  There are no longer enough spots for everyone and they are just letting you all duke it out.", "If anyone can park in any spot then tell them you\u2019re not going to pay for the spot anymore", "Get them towed - or stop paying for the spot.", "If there\u2019s not enough spots for everyone, your parking fee should be adjusted. Otherwise, they need to assign people from the lower level a temporary spot each so everyone knows where to park. I would be talking to a tenants rights organization in your city to see what legal recourse you have.", "NTA - Document via emails to Property Management of this issue with pictures of the 2 vehicles (with license plates) parking in your spot (include the parking space number or designation in the picture). Document everything with dates. Also, copy/scan your lease which shows that you pay $135 a month for your parking spot. Finally, take pictures of the broken gate and the flooding.\n\nEmail your property management that they (not you) need to correct this issue with the parking spot you are paying for since it is a property issue. If you have a copy of the apartment management's notice for the free-for-all parking situation, scan/copy that as well into an email.\n\nAll of this will be your backup if legal action is necessary. Also, screenshot and email the texts that were sent to you. Again, documentation is key to your defense. Whatever you have said verbally or in a note left on a vehicle is not legally binding. What is legally binding is your lease that says you pay $135 for an open and usable parking space on the property.\n\nI would also recommend that you not park in someone else's spot. You are then doing what these Teslas are doing. Also, do not stop paying your parking fees. Also, do not call a towing company yourself. The property management should do this. In fact, there are probably signs on your property stating that vehicles will be towed for infractions. \n\nIf this continues, you now have documentation to legally present if something should happen to you, your vehicle, or your status living at the apartment complex.\n\nEDIT: Remember to CC yourself when you send your email to the property management. Do not blind CC yourself. Make sure they see that you have CC'd yourself, so they cannot say they did not receive your email.", "Nta You are not. Have them towed.

What has mgmt said about parking given that many spaces are flooded? I'm wondering if maybe you missed some notification that it was first come first serve while the flooding went on?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI mean if the spots are 135/month, and say 25% of them are flooded, then if things are still assigned, that would mean the mgmt needed to give refunds to 25% of the paid parkers.\n\nWhat is the plan for that, short and long term? \n\nAnd isn't there an automatic towing company that gets called if someone in a spot they aren't allowed in?\n\nToo many loose ends to know what is up.", "Info: are they no other available spots for you to park in? If there are other free soots, just park there?? Who cares. Also- do the teslas live at the same place as you/also pay for parking? If so, how do you know their spot wasn\u2019t originally on the flooded floor. If you pay for parking and the level floods so you have to move to a different floor which management says is ok then that\u2019s fine- you would do the same thing if you were on the flooded floor. \nIf the Teslas don\u2019t pay to park in the garage and there are no other spots then yeah jus type them.
