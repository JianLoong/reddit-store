However, I do want my spot since I paid 135 a month, and I don't mind people parking at my spot temporarily I leave notes to them saying hey can I have my spot, when I have to park at someone else's spot I leave a note on my car saying I'm sorry for bothering you text me and I'll move my car. Most people move after they saw the note, and I am grateful for that.\n\nHowever,  there has been 2 teslas (of course it's tesla) that constantly park at my spot, I left a note first time when I saw them at my spot politely asking them to move. Couple days later they came back again and I left a note again asking them to move. After about 3 times I've had enough because at this point they are doing this on purpose. Last night they were at my spot again, so I left a note on one of the Teslas saying if I see them at my spot again I will tow them. \n\nThey found my number through the note I left on my car, and texted me last night saying I was threatening them. The person who texted me said that she's the friend of the other tesla which leads me to believe that they are doing this on purpose trading off my parking spot just to annoy me. I told them I kindly asked them to move several times and they kept coming back, and saying I was being rude and threatening them and causing them anxiety by asking them to move their ass away from my spot. \n\nAt this point I gave up arguing with them and I said if yall really like my spot just take it I don't care anymore. Today I went downstairs to check if they did something to my car and I found a note saying that they had me on sentry mode and told me to not touch their cars again.  \n\nAm I the asshole for leaving the note telling them I'll tow them?", "created_utc": 1696197006, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16xe1ch/aita_wanting_to_tow_someone_thats_been_in_my/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
