We went to high school together and got an apartment with another roommate since we all went to colleges in the city. \n\nMy best friend \u201cAnna\u201d actually was the one to encourage me to room with him. She wanted us to bond since we weren\u2019t very close in high school despite being in the same friend group, as he\u2019s standoffish and cold.(my friends refer to anna and nick as the black cat golden retriever duo) Over the last few months I\u2019ve gotten to be good friends with Nick, which makes Anna really happy. I still maintain some more distance then I usually would with friends, out of respect. \n\nAbout a week ago I went to a party and got super wasted. Nick came to pick me up and take me home so I wouldn\u2019t take the subway alone. When we got back to our apt, I was parked in front of the toilet throwing up for about ten minutes, all of which he held my hair back. Then I stumbled into the nearest bedroom to collapse in, which was his as it\u2019s right next to the br. Nick tried to get me to go to my own room but everytime I moved I would end up falling. Our third roommate was still studying for finals so to prevent me from bothering her with my noise Nick just let me stay in his room. I fell asleep on his bed and he stayed with me to make sure I wouldn\u2019t throw up in my sleep. He originally slept on the floor but I almost threw up on him in the middle of the night so he just sat with  me on the bed where I ended up falling asleep on his shoulder.\n\nwe came home for break and I told Anna and a couple of our other friends teh story as I didn\u2019t want to keep it from her since I felt bad. She told me it was totally fine as she trusts us both and was glad he had taken care of me. Our other friends though have been calling me and saying it was wrong of me to sleep in his bed plus falling asleep on him. Nothing happened but I still feel guilty.

You were wasted and the boyfriend handled the situation appropriately. As long as your bsf and her bf are cool with it, none of the others opinions matters.", "NAH except the people sexualizing what sounds like a very normal and transparent friendship. If you got so drunk that you couldn\u2019t make it to bed and were repeatedly throwing up, Nick did the right thing by staying with you to monitor you. If I were being really critical, I might call you TA for getting that drunk in the first place. Just be careful going forward about knowing your limits with alcohol.", "nta. you were drunk, anna isn\u2019t angry with you guys. obviously she trusts you and knows you wouldn\u2019t do something like that (making a move on nick) if you were sober it would be a different story but you were drunk and sick.", "Ehhh\u2026something about this feels off. Maybe Anna really is fine with it\u2026or maybe she isn\u2019t and has confided in your other friends who are calling you out. How did Nick know to come and get you from the party? And you being able to make it to his room but not yours doesn\u2019t sit right with me. Something about this whole story just feels off.", "Nta but don't doit again, if so YATA", "NTA, tell your other friends to bugger off and mind their own business. Full disclosure was made to Anna. She's ok with it, and her opinion is the only one that matters.", "I can\u2019t tell if you are or aren\u2019t because even tho you made your self sound innocent. There\u2019s a few red flags \n1. Why did you have to add \u201call of which he held my hair back?\u201d Why add that, it\u2019s unnecessary unless you\u2019re trying to make someone jealous. \n2. The reason you ended up in his room sounds made up. I would\u2019ve believed you couldn\u2019t make it to your room because you were so drunk, but adding the whole not bothering the other roommate that\u2019s fishy \n3. You felt guilty, why feel guilty if you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Your friend obviously trust you both enough to live together why wouldn\u2019t she trust you if he took care of you all night you were wasted. Usually only guilty people feel guilty", "Well, technically NTA BUT how would you feel if your bf spent a night in the same bed as your friend because he felt she should not be taken to her own room and also that she needed him to hold her hair while puking, watch her all night, play a pillow for her etc? It was his decision but overall I think you need maybe sticker boundaries for this friendship to remain friendship.", "Probably gonna be unpopular, but since this situation was entirely your fault, YTA.. but ESH (except your friend). \n\nThe term \"drink responsibly\" applies here. Who got white girl wasted? Who didn't have a plan to get home? Who couldn't hold their shit together and had to puke? And who wandered into his bed, passed out, probably coaxed him back into his bed with you, then cuddled up next to him and fell asleep? That's right, you did all that. Accept responsibility for your own actions, think about how to avoid situations like that in the future, and appreciate the fact that your friend is a saint, and didn't stab you like some psychotic/jealous gf. Your friends bf shouldn't have let it happen, so he sucks. Your other friends suck because they didn't call you on it in front of Anna.", "NTA because from the description, everything seems appropriate and above board... However, reading between the lines, why would you feel guilty? Are you covering for something that you did together whilst in the bedroom together? If not, have you started developing feelings for him? Has he started developing feelings for you? It feels like there are some blanks in the story.", "Ehhh\u2026.\n\nNo offense this story is also the beginning of every story where a guy tells his gf the roommate is nothing to worry about\u2026\n\nThis can\u2019t happen again is the main thing. Some sounds made up. You kept falling? Then how did you end up sleeping on his shoulder\u2026could you also not control your neck? You need another \u201csavior\u201d if you are going to be out drinking like that. Treat him as a roommate and not a best friend.", "NAH", "Don't betray Anna after this.  Just saying.", "NTA he seems like a good guy, you know the boundaries and your friend trusts you both. I think you\u2019re good. Plus, you were beyond wasted. If you were just a little tipsy, then it would be a different story", "If anything YTA for getting drunk to the point of needing help. Not responsible", "NTA", "YTA and if you were my friend I definitely would be mad at you but just don\u2019t do it again. You obviously have a good friend who\u2019s not mad at you but don\u2019t do it again. Falling asleep on him is definitely going overboard", "I\u2019ve never once tended to a male friend while he puked or let him sleep on my shoulder so I could make sure he wouldn\u2019t choke. \n\nAs another poster pointed out you were irresponsible the entire night. Your story all sounds a little too justified. Nick just had to sleep in the bed with you because you almost puked all over him on the floor. \n\nSo it\u2019s easy to read your story as you attempting to get close to Nick. That your friend doesn\u2019t see it that way is a kind interpretation. \n\nDon\u2019t make a habit of this.", "NTA nothing happened and no one intended for anything to happen.", "YTA. Next time don\u2019t get so drunk you need this much assistance from a roommate. Do keep in mind this guy is your trusting best friend\u2019s boyfriend. Seems like you expect a lot from him: from walking you home to taking care of you all night. It\u2019s not really that appropriate. \n\nTwo months from now you\u2019re going to be dating asking Reddit if YTA because \u201cit just happened\u201d.", "NTA sounds like bro was just looking out for you", "NAH, her friends are right to be a bit sus but avoid getting so hammered you need to rely on your bestfriends bf to look after you", "NTA You we\u2019re drunk and we\u2019re incapable of fully thinking through whether you should sleep in his bed, and he did the right thing by taking care of you. I\u2019m glad your friend understands that, and isn\u2019t mad. Good for you, being upfront and making sure that she knows what happened \u2014 that probably went a long way with helping her not feel insecure and suspicious about it. Everyone actually involved in the situation is totally fine, and everyone else needs to butt out, because it\u2019s a total non-issue. Not like anyone was being deliberately inappropriate, and it\u2019s not like this is a habit. Everything is fine.", "NTA and who even cares what anyone but your bff thinks? Real talk though let this be a learning experience about alcohol. BFF and Nick sound like solid companions, but Booze ain\u2019t your friend!", "NTA. A friend helping a friend. I wouldn\u2019t aim to have this happen again but 1 time is okay.", "YTA for getting that badly drunk. Even at 18 myself, I've never been that bad.\n\nDrink responsibly.", "NTA \ni get why the situation could be upsetting or off putting for Anna but the fact that she didn\u2019t mind and you felt bad and instantly told her to get it off your chest and to be completely transparent with her proves how healthy and understanding your relationship is. Your common friends shouldn\u2019t make you feel worse or make the situation much bigger than it is in Annas head if truly nothing is going on with you and her bf because then they\u2019re just messing with your friendship for no reason. try to as much as possible not to get in a similar situation with the bf again because that will be\u2026 messy and just put you in an overall bad position", "Nta your friend is fine with it. You didn\u2019t do anything with him and he didn\u2019t do anything. The friends just want drama it seems. I wouldn\u2019t worry about it.", "NTA. The only people whose opinions matter have no problem with it.", "NTA OP. You told Anna and she said she said she trusted you, that's all you need. Your other \"friends\" need to blocked and ignored. Don't let them break you and drag you down to their level.", "Nah. Drunkenness can sometimes be an acceptable reason in my world, but I wouldn\u2019t do it again!", "NTA \n\nBut I kind of think Nick is. \n\nHe stayed there the whole night? \n\nLike I get supervising someone but he shouldn't of stayed in the bed with you, he could've gone to your bed.", "NTA. But PLEASE  stay away from the third friend, 3that person is stupid, sick and toxic and she/he will start s#!t where there is none. That person isn't a good friend.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

You may want to talk with your friend, his girlfriend, and make sure that she\u2019s okay with what occurred.", "NTA.  Your friend is ok with it.  He is ok with it.  You were ok with it.  Nothing happened.    \n\n\nYour other friends that arent involved in this in any way do not get to have an opinion.", "Anna such an angel \ud83e\udd7a. She just ok with that?!

Nick did her a solid, and if she'd choked on her own vomit while she slept alone they'd probably have blamed him for that.", "number 2 is what i don\u2019t get the most, i have been blackout drunk to the point ive fallen asleep sat on the bathroom floor with my head on the toilet after staying there cos i still felt sick, never have i just walked into the closet room to pass out. also if the boyfriend was with her the whole time she was throwing up why did he let her in his room instead of directing her to her own", "I would be happy if my bf prevented my friend from choking and dying in her sleep, or any other medical event that can happen when you drink that much. If he left someone that drunk on their own I would consider him an awful person. If you think this is a sexual situation that's crazy. If you are worried your bf would do something sexual with a girl who is not even capable of walking, that's scary. I would be very worried about something different in that case and a guy like that would not be my bf.", "Two thoughts here.    \n\n\n1.  Yeah, be more careful in the future as OP doesn't want this to become a habit or OPs friend may start having an issue with it.  Then her other friends opinions (which currently are irrelevant) will become relevant.\n2. It doesn't matter how she would feel.  Her friend is OK with what happened and seems happy that it happened the way it did so I see absolutely no issue here.  All relevant parties are pleased with the outcome.", "Even though the friend is cool with it, I know of no one that would be cool with it. If my gf did this with another dude I would leave without question. To even get to this point with someone else's partner is totally lame. \n\nAs for the bf, I would never do anything close to this with my gf's friend. I would call her as it happened so she would know right away at the very least, then we could solve it together. For most, you both crossed boundaries.", "I guess she's feeling guilty because the idiot other friends are being judgemental and sexualising shoulders", "I see you\u2019ve never been 18 before\u2026", "Oh come on everyone goes through this when they first started drinking. She\u2019s literally 18.", "NTA, purely situational.  In your situation she WBTAH.  But its not yours and her friend is good with it so, NTA.", "Do you think OP, in all her drunkenness, was really expecting these things? From the sound of the story, he stepped in and was trying to be a good guy. \n\nAlso getting wasted is what young people do. Some of them get drunk while their friends look after them and then they swap the next weekend, it's not that deep.", "I mean, I would say OP is YTA just because she got blackout drunk and inconvenienced someone else that way. Even if Nick was a woman.    \n\nBut let\u2019s assume OP was sick and not drunk, and had to have Nick look after her in the same bedroom, I would say it\u2019s fine as long as Anna is ok with it.", "&#x200B;\n\nId argue NTA, its purely situational.  All involved parties were perfectly fine with the course of events.  What more is there to discuss?  The friends with nosy opinions have no say.", "I would do that (if I could - I would have organised someone to do that though) and all of my friends would do the same. If she was throwing up in her sleep this was more of a medical emergency than anything else. It doesn\u2019t matter whose bed this was or who stayed with her. It only matters to keep the person with alcohol poisoning alive. \n\nAlcohol poisoning is serious business and in countries with free healthcare this can in extreme cases warrant a 911 call.", "Maybe \u201cnick\u201d is just one of those genuine nice people. Who knows though", "I think I would have been thankful that he'd stayed to keep an eye, \nand made sure my friend didn't choke on her vomit in her sleep and die.", "So many times ive been with my friends when they are blackout drunk and throwing up and I don\u2019t cuddle in the bed with them?? Actually so many things the bf could have done differently", "I think you all are being a bit harsh on the BF. He was being a good guy. And he\u2019s not going to call and wake up his gf in the middle of the night for a non-emergency. But yes he would be the AH if he didn\u2019t tell Anna first thing in the morning.", "Ya if she was like 26 I\u2019d say that\u2019s pretty irresponsible to be getting that wasted. At 18 it\u2019s more of a learning experience lmao", "Weird comment normalizing blackout alcoholism is weird", "Even if I'm blackout drunk I'm not sleeping on my best friends BFs shoulder", "Could be, I don't know. \n\nBut he has a GF, and it's still OP who has to tell her? \n\nIt's just fishy", "Honestly, hearing that my bf was so great and trustworthy with my drunken best friend would be like an aphrodisiac and a love potion. It's really hot when the people you love are solidly good people, especially when they take care of someone you also want to take care of.", "I mean the story sounds made up because if she was that drunk she would hardly remember something like the specific position she fell asleep in. There is also a few really weird details thrown in that seemed designed to rile up the Reddit audience. But regardless, there is no word of him cuddling her. Maybe in the story she fell asleep on his shoulder and he then moved her into the recovery position?\n\nBased on what is written, I wouldn't care and would be happy my bf took care of my friend. I don't think a situation where one person is so drunk they can't walk while the other is sober, is a sexual situation. I wouldn't personally date a guy who I believed sees that as a sexual situation, so there's not any way for me to feel about it other than he took care of my friend. If I thought my bf saw a blackout drunk, vomiting and unable to walk girl as a sexual opportunity and was pretending to care for her to get close to her sexually, he wouldn't be my bf any longer.", "I mean \"normalizing\" is a stretch. But a LOT of high schoolers/college kids have had that sort of experience. Calling it alcoholism is very bizarre. I mean I got that drunk a few times, I'm not remotely an alcoholic.", "I see you\u2019ve never been 18 before\u2026", "Well we only know what's written here and don't know more than that, let's assume positive and not negative \ud83e\udee0", "Anyone who has ever had a single beer is an alcoholic to a huge swatch of Reddit.", "No one I know who had blackout drunk experiences at 18 is in a good place in life right now, but alright", "She clearly didn\u2019t \u00ab\u00a0blackout\u00a0\u00bb if she recounted her whole experience in this post, but alright", "Mine was at 16 and my successful marriage, career and family would disagree with you.", "Too bad your anecdotal life experience is pretty much irrelevant in the face of quantitative [data](https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/underage-drinking.htm)", "You do realize your statement was just as anecdotal, right?"]}
