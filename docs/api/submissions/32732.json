Men that are mid-30s plus NEED TO HAVE THEIR OWN PLACE TO LIVE\n\nDo not date men that can not afford to support themselves.\n\nAdjustments to these rules are as follows:\n\n1. A man at any age with MULTIPLE children should have HIS OWN PLACE TO LIVE\n2. Men that may be living at home to support and / or take care of their elderly parents (you need to think this one through, when you move in together what happens)\n3. People that may travel extensively for work that may be in their residential city 14 or less days a month. These people where possible tend to live at home and / or with roommates.\n\nYou don\u2019t have ages here, but like everyone said, you don\u2019t become \u201cmother like\u201d after marriage.

That you expect that you\u2019ll be more maternal at some point in the future is also concerning - developing a step parent relationship is touchy and delicate at best, expecting it to appear after marriage is horribly optimistic. \n\nSo while you should see how the group lives together, you shouldn\u2019t do that in an apartment that is too small for all of you together! Set your family up for success where you all can get what you need! If the kids can share a room, that sounds like needing at least three bedrooms.

His kids are not going anywhere. It would be far better for you and for them to be used to living together *before* the marriage happens so you can make sure it\u2019s working before committing fully to each other. \n\n\nHe wants his children to live with him. He wants to live with you. He sees an empty bedroom and it\u2019s fair for him to think you could try it.\n\n\nProblem is, as someone on the spectrum myself who needs alone time like I need oxygen, you also need that space. It\u2019s overwhelming to think of how much disruption to routine two children will bring\u2026but if you intend to marry this man then you are going to have to take that on. You need to think if you can honestly cope if you don\u2019t have a specific private space to go to. \n\n\nYou haven\u2019t used the room for that purpose for some time so it\u2019s full of junk- that\u2019s why your fianc\u00e9 thinks it could be a bedroom, because you aren\u2019t using it as a cool-down space. The problem is your brain is freaking out at the thought of taking the room away more permanently and overwhelmed because of having the kids in your space. That\u2019s fair.\n\n\nCould you afford to rent or buy a home where there is a bedroom for the kids and also somewhere to make your private chill out space? A place with a garden or yard could have a chill out area for you if the weather is nice or a nice hut or shed for bad weather, all decorated how you like it and there for you to use when you wished but also the kids can stay. If outside isn\u2019t possible then somewhere with a small office area or third bedroom, a conservatory or attic might work for you. If you and your fianc\u00e9 pool your money could you afford a place like this? \n\n\nBasically I think this issue will keep coming up and I think you need to try living with the kids before marriage because if you can\u2019t cope with it then that\u2019s a deal breaker and it\u2019s better to know before you get married. If your  lease isn\u2019t up for a while then talk about looking for a home in the meantime and cleaning up your room so that it can be used. Right now it\u2019s full of junk. I know it can be comforting but right now it\u2019s just a junk room, not a chill out space. \n\n\nIf all of this sounds like too much then you need to think if being with someone who has children while working a busy stressful medical job is actually what is best for you and for him. He is a dad and an involved dad at that, this won\u2019t change. You have a stressful job and certain needs in order to maintain good health and mental wellness, that won\u2019t change either. His kids have a right to be comfortable in the home they share with him in who they are living with- you need to try overnights if you are going to stay together. \n\n\nYou are at the crossroads, you need to think hard about what you want and can handle. Talk to your fianc\u00e9, be honest and reach a conclusion that suits everyone\u2019s needs. Neither of you is an asshole so far but you really need to work out what you want.", "YTA. Both of you are, you should have discussed this before getting engaged. It is a fair assumption that if post marriage your husband was going to live with you that his children would too and in not flagging your refusal to do this you\u2019ve basically led the guy on. Also if your autism is so significant wouldn\u2019t it be worth doing some sort of trial of seeing how you and the children will all get on together and how you can make it work.

You really need to be honest with yourself and him if you can handle all that. If you can\u2019t now it\u2019s a huge problem. It\u2019s also not  fair to anyone to move to a new town and house for you to realize you can\u2019t cope with kids being kids.", "NAH - but you should consider if you are compatible in the long run. Knowing your limits and living in a way where you get to accommodate them is really crucial, and for you it takes more than the average person. And the consequences of not going it would be worse for you than for most people.\n\nBut he is a father and his children are part of the package. There really is no way around that. Would it work out for you if you could find a larger apartment so you could still have a room for yourself? If do, that might be the way forward. But if the problem simply is the added stress of living with children, you might not want to move forward together.", "NTA but if he can\u2019t afford to pay rent right now , he shouldn\u2019t be moving his kids into your place. The way he\u2019s being so forceful with you giving them a bedroom is a red flag . \n\nYou should wait until it\u2019s time to move to the \u2018bigger\u2019 house before you let him move in . Homeboy is going to move his kids into your current home , and conveniently never be able to pay rent . And conveniently won\u2019t be able to contribute to a bigger place. \n\nGreat plan he has - move the kids in , make sure you know he can\u2019t contribute\u2026 he\u2019s all set .\n\nGirl don\u2019t let that man or his kids move into your home until he can contribute appropriately for all three of them . And don\u2019t marry him either until he does so .", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDOn't date a dad if you are not ready to make his kids your family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"At the end of 2024 I am changing jobs and we are all moving in together in a bigger space out of state \u2014 him, me, the kids, and he will pay rent there. They would just need to be patient until then.\" .. bullshit. If it is that fix, his moving in with you can wait until then. HE needs to live with his kids.", "I'm confused: why do you love him? What for God sake is about to love in such a man.? Why aren't you running?", "Agree. Nobody is the asshole, but OP isn't magically going to overcome these issues based on a status change from engaged to married. It's also not unrealistic for her fiance to want to do a trial run where everyone lives together before they tie the knot to feel out the family dynamics.", "Yep. He should be the provider for all of you. This is upside down.", "I agree. The red flags are flying.", "There is no lease, OP owns the apartment.", "That's the sketchy part to me.  How can a grown man with 2 kids not be able to afford a place to live now but magically will be able to afford a place next year?", "op added an edit, it is the idea of the children in the small apartment she has issues with, not living with them in general. \n\nalso she should run her fianc\u00e9 seems to be trying to push the children on her when he doesn't live there either!", "> At the end of 2024 I am changing jobs and we are all moving in together in a bigger space out of state \u2014 him, me, the kids, and he will pay rent there. They would just need to be patient until then.\n\nThe edit was probably added after you posted", "Strong \"hobosexual\" vibes.", "10 and 7", "I would add that he needs to be self-supporting and supporting his kids.", "He needs to be set free if he isn't paying rent at all for himself and the kids. She doesn't need someone who's getting a free ride. He can find some other sap who will soon be posting about \"I love him, but he has no money. What should I dooo?\"", "LOL none of those are \"news flashes\".  OP lives in a small apartment where the lease doesn't allow additional people to live there.   Her BF and his kids \"live\" with grandma (who apparently pays for the accommodations and does all of the childcare while BF spends the nights at OP's apartment.\n\nNow BF suddenly is \"insisting\" that he move the kids into the small apartment (violating the lease so risking being evicted or a rent increase) and OP pay for everything-- with implications that granny may be tired of being the unpaid nanny.\n\nOP is 100% on board with moving the children in when they get the larger living quarters next year.", "Just like how he\u2019s looking out for them now . Can\u2019t afford to house his own kids so he needs to move himself and his kids into her tiny apartment, all while he can\u2019t afford to contribute to rent . They aren\u2019t his priority, his priority is convincing her to bankroll his and his kids lives and she\u2019ll most probably have to become sole caretaker for them anyway.", "But with OP's edit it actually makes sense: in that future bigger house they can dedicate one quiet room with sound proofing elements to OP so OP has a space to retreat to whenever they need the quiet. Trial run makes sense, but on the other hand it's impossible in the current circumstances (lease and space). We can already tell it would be a failure with four people getting crammed into space OP needs just for themselves.", "There definitely is a lease, OP stated she pays rent, what thread are you reading?", "YTA. I mean how did you think this would pan out with 2 minors? They are his kids and by agreeing to marry him you are taking on that responsibility. Maybe wait until you\u2019re married to move in together if you need more time to consider how you want them in your space or maybe considering getting a bigger place together so that you can have your quiet room and the kids can have rooms of their own then everyone wins. Otherwise if you never want them to live with you then don\u2019t marry a man with kids. You can\u2019t just expect him to move in without his kids, they\u2019re minors.", "*\"I love him but he has no money and doesn't take care of his own kids, just leaves them to his aging grandmother. He also wants to push that responsibility onto me while I'm the only one paying bills\".", "Right in the original post she says she purchased the apartment.", "I didn\u2019t say I never want them in my house, I do, but after we are married and in a bigger space. It\u2019s my apartment not his and he wouldn\u2019t be paying rent even if they all moved in, he says.", "But then she talks about how she has a lease and isn\u2019t meant to move anyone else in. That doesn\u2019t sound like an owner.", "Three sentences later, she talks about rent and the lease. I believe the word purchase is being used a bit unusually by the OP, and that they are in fact a renter.", "How will both of you be able to magically afford a larger space if he can't afford to pay you anything right now?", "Sounds like a freeloader.  You would be foolish to let him move in.  That's not even addressing your valid concerns re his children.   Wise up before you find yourself supporting him and his kids, as his grandmother has been doing.   Hold out for a partner who isn't reliant on others to put a roof over his head.  Or don't,  but be prepared to carry 100% of the financial load.  (Why you'd want to do so is puzzling)", "Does he not understand that it becomes his the moment he and his children move in? Have you discussed finances a d childcare once you are married? I feel like he\u2019s going to make you pay for everything a d be expected to parent his children", "*IF* you were all to move in together, it would need to be into a bigger place than your's. Even with two bedrooms, it is just big enough for you alone. It's going to be jam packed with three more people in there. You are not going to have any space of your own, and if that's something that you need, it's going to be very hard, and very frustrating. Out of sheer, morbid curiosity, how did he settle upon not contributing any rent? Where is his money going? Were you consulted in this process?", "Hey OP NTA. I do have to ask though. Do these kids have a mom? Have you 2 discussed what your role would be like? How you will transition to a family? These are things you NEED to talk about. This is a big transition for all of you & shouldn't be rushed. If you don't work this out I don't think this is going to work."]}
