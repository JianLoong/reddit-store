One of those needs is a distraction free / \u201cquiet\u201d room. So when I moved after my med program I made sure to purchase a two bedroom apartment in which one room is the bedroom and the other room is my quiet office and cooldown room.

I\u2019m not comfortable with this, as I am not ready to be a full-time step mother yet, my career has just started, I work a very busy medical job that is high stress, and I plan to be a more active parental figure after we are married. However, he insists that I need to empty out my office and make it a children\u2019s bedroom.

Men that are mid-30s plus NEED TO HAVE THEIR OWN PLACE TO LIVE\n\nDo not date men that can not afford to support themselves.\n\nAdjustments to these rules are as follows:\n\n1. A man at any age with MULTIPLE children should have HIS OWN PLACE TO LIVE\n2. Men that may be living at home to support and / or take care of their elderly parents (you need to think this one through, when you move in together what happens)\n3. People that may travel extensively for work that may be in their residential city 14 or less days a month. These people where possible tend to live at home and / or with roommates.\n\nYou don\u2019t have ages here, but like everyone said, you don\u2019t become \u201cmother like\u201d after marriage.

That you expect that you\u2019ll be more maternal at some point in the future is also concerning - developing a step parent relationship is touchy and delicate at best, expecting it to appear after marriage is horribly optimistic. \n\nSo while you should see how the group lives together, you shouldn\u2019t do that in an apartment that is too small for all of you together! Set your family up for success where you all can get what you need! If the kids can share a room, that sounds like needing at least three bedrooms.

His kids are not going anywhere. It would be far better for you and for them to be used to living together *before* the marriage happens so you can make sure it\u2019s working before committing fully to each other. \n\n\nHe wants his children to live with him. He wants to live with you. He sees an empty bedroom and it\u2019s fair for him to think you could try it.\n\n\nProblem is, as someone on the spectrum myself who needs alone time like I need oxygen, you also need that space. It\u2019s overwhelming to think of how much disruption to routine two children will bring\u2026but if you intend to marry this man then you are going to have to take that on. You need to think if you can honestly cope if you don\u2019t have a specific private space to go to. \n\n\nYou haven\u2019t used the room for that purpose for some time so it\u2019s full of junk- that\u2019s why your fianc\u00e9 thinks it could be a bedroom, because you aren\u2019t using it as a cool-down space. The problem is your brain is freaking out at the thought of taking the room away more permanently and overwhelmed because of having the kids in your space. That\u2019s fair.\n\n\nCould you afford to rent or buy a home where there is a bedroom for the kids and also somewhere to make your private chill out space? A place with a garden or yard could have a chill out area for you if the weather is nice or a nice hut or shed for bad weather, all decorated how you like it and there for you to use when you wished but also the kids can stay. If outside isn\u2019t possible then somewhere with a small office area or third bedroom, a conservatory or attic might work for you. If you and your fianc\u00e9 pool your money could you afford a place like this? \n\n\nBasically I think this issue will keep coming up and I think you need to try living with the kids before marriage because if you can\u2019t cope with it then that\u2019s a deal breaker and it\u2019s better to know before you get married. If your  lease isn\u2019t up for a while then talk about looking for a home in the meantime and cleaning up your room so that it can be used. Right now it\u2019s full of junk. I know it can be comforting but right now it\u2019s just a junk room, not a chill out space. \n\n\nIf all of this sounds like too much then you need to think if being with someone who has children while working a busy stressful medical job is actually what is best for you and for him. He is a dad and an involved dad at that, this won\u2019t change. You have a stressful job and certain needs in order to maintain good health and mental wellness, that won\u2019t change either. His kids have a right to be comfortable in the home they share with him in who they are living with- you need to try overnights if you are going to stay together. \n\n\nYou are at the crossroads, you need to think hard about what you want and can handle. Talk to your fianc\u00e9, be honest and reach a conclusion that suits everyone\u2019s needs. Neither of you is an asshole so far but you really need to work out what you want.", "YTA. Both of you are, you should have discussed this before getting engaged. It is a fair assumption that if post marriage your husband was going to live with you that his children would too and in not flagging your refusal to do this you\u2019ve basically led the guy on. Also if your autism is so significant wouldn\u2019t it be worth doing some sort of trial of seeing how you and the children will all get on together and how you can make it work.
