I did it once for an intake appointment and had to find a new provider because of it.", "Sounds like you need to explain to him that where you are you cannot be late to a doctor, they will not see you if you are late. And remind him as the next appointment approaches that you need to be at the doctors office no later than the appointment time, so if his prayers need to happen from 2:40\n-3:10 or whatever reschedule the appointment now to a time he verifies he will not be praying over. NAH, sounds like a misunderstanding.", "NTA \n\nI have to assume he new his prayer would be cutting into his doctor appointment and so he should have made sure to mention this so the time could be moved. \n\nIf he want to practice religion then it\u2019s his job to make sure appointments do not conflict with it.", "It's not a racist thing. It's him not respecting someone else's time. Being late means he doesn't respect your or the doctors time, or the fact that he had to wait months to get this appointment in the first place. \n\nNtA. \n\nIt's a new country so he needs to adapt to the rules of the country. Being late due to Religion is not really an excuse.", "Absolutely not TA, how old is the child?\nHe had a lot of notice for the appointment day and time, had a reminder that morning. He had opportunity to say I can't do that time. Cancelling the appointment and rescheduling was his best option showing up late or not at all he may have found he was marked did not attend and possibly discharged. Maybe he can use this as a learning opportunity that the world won't wait for him no matter how important he perceives what he is doing is.", "I'm... not seeing how what you did was racist. It would've been racist had you forced the child away from prayers. If I'm guessing correctly, it is indeed very important to his religion that those prayers are said at the correct times.\n\nIt's also not racist to conform to the norms of the country you're in. You're right, in most countries, a doctor will cancel an appointment, (and charge a fee, too,) if you don't show up on time.\n\nI'm not sure there was any alternative to the way you handled it. Just makes sure that the new appointment doesn't conflict with the child's religious obligations, and I should think everything will be just fine.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nHe knew well in advance what time his appointment was and when he had to leave. He needed to arrange his schedule around his appointment. It's ludicrous to expect a doctor to tolerate patients coming in whenever they feel like it. \n\nIt is not \"racist\", not is it religious discrimination, to follow proper protocol when it comes to Dr appts.\n\nThe kid needs to learn that the universe doesn't revolve around him. He is entitled to a \"reasonable accommodation\" to practice his religion, and that's *it*.", "It\u2019s very controversial\u2026 but I\u2019d say NTA \nI know prayers are super important and every religion should be respected: for this reason he should have booked an appointment at a time when no prayers were scheduled. \nAn easy example: my mum is very catholic and she would never book an appointment on a Sunday morning.\n\nYou should try to communicate better next time, trying to understand his religion and his needs; I don\u2019t think you are a racist, he prioritised his prayers over his health and it was HIS decision, but a better communication could help!", "INFO\nHad there been a discussion about the importance of being on time to appointments and the possibility of the doctor cancelling if they were late?\nHad it not been seen that the appointment was at prayer time so maybe it needed to be rearranged before it was the day of the appointment?", "Islamically, the prayer should be made as close to time. If he's uk based, then asr prayer had gone and maghrib prayer time not arrived. So he was already late!\n\nIt sounds as though he's turning it into a racial thing when it clearly was down to his lack of planning and basic courtesy.\n\nYou did the right thing.", "NTA. Muslims can skip prayers and make up for it later, and it happens pretty regularly. As a Muslim, I've never seen someone around me schedule appointments around prayer times or deliberately be late for an appointment because they were praying. They pray around it. I just simply think the dude forgot about the appointment lol.\n\nYou're not racist nor are you disrespecting his religion. Next time, maybe remind him 1 hour before the appointment and mention that you can't be late or you'll have to cancel the appointment. That's an ample enough warning.", "NTA. I am not sure, if it is smart to insult the people helping you as racist. Especially when they respect your prayer. But that\u2019s on him to figure out.", "INFO What will the health effects of waiting two months be? I assume you would have at least tried to get him in late if he is a minor in pain/in danger?", "INFO: Why didn\u2019t you ask the doctor if it was okay to arrive late before rescheduling?  Sure, the doctor might have said no, but they might\u2019ve said yes, and you said yourself that this was an important appointment,", "NTA You weren't even leaving until 3pm you were going to be very late to the Doctors.", "You were not wrong to reschedule, although it may be that you could have rang to see if they were running late first. It may be that the boy did not realise that doctors only allocate 9 minutes to a patient appointment and will not wait - however he is hopefully aware now. NTA\n\nEdit I saw another comment saying that there is s prayer schedule that you could look up to make sure you don\u2019t plan things around those times, that might be appropriate to check it so you can be more sensitive to their religion.", "I don\u2019t understand why people are intentionally vague in these posts. \u201cImportant in his religion\u201d? What religion? It\u2019s fairly obviously Islam so why try to pretend it is something else?", "YTA- maybe not you personally but you as a stand in for the staff of the home. Whoever made the appointment- and I don\u2019t think it was the 16 year old - should have talked about the time with the young man & made sure that it would work with the young man\u2019s other commitments, including his religious commitments. The population you serve - minor refugees- by their nature doesn\u2019t understand the complete culture they are now living in & may not be comfortable or know how to advocate for themselves. Part of sheltering & supporting them is teaching them things they need to know to live here, & whoever managed the appointment dropped the ball.\n\nYou were probably wrong to cancel the appointment, especially 10 minutes before the appointment time. I have been to many doctors where being late was no issue at all. They run behind schedule or they just go on to the next appointment & come back  to late comers when they\u2019re there. For doctors who do run a tight schedule, canceling 10 minutes before an appointment is not better than being late. It\u2019s not like they can call another patient in on 10 minutes notice.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut if you can not handle the intercultural issues, why would you volunteer there. Don'tz you know when they have to pray? Learn to plan better.", "Why would you even be waiting until 10 minutes prior to the appointment to leave?\n\nYou should have already been there at that time!\n\nESH.\n\nYou for not telling him to be ready earlier/leaving earlier and him for not being ready at a reasonable time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Point out that doctors expect you to be checked in and have the proper paperwork filled out by x time. If you're not there by a certain time, the staff will assume you're a no-show.

You're supposed to be looking after him not controlling him. At the end of the day like yeah being that late to an appointment is bad but it wasnt up to you to cancel. For all you know the doctor might have made space for a late arrival anyway.", "NTA.

They are based on astronomy its not like this kid deliberately scheduled an appointment during prayers. Could he had thought ahead and found a schedule? Possibly, but how yall gonna tell him to schedule the sun?", "Yta. This is a traumatized child.

Executive functioning skills? This is what he needs.", "I'm kinda half and half. \n\nNTA for trying to make sure he got to the appointment on time but I'm also curious why it was planned if he has scheduled prayer times every day. Was the time originally discussed with him in advance with him giving the okay? \n\nAlthough I would say YTA for not asking the receptionist at the office if coming a bit late was acceptable and I can understand his anger at that, especially if it was an important appointment. \n\nPerhaps sit and have a chat with the person and have a healthy communication about the situation. Could bring up how you respect his religious needs and apologize for how it made him feel and that you recognize that you weren't in a completely clear head at the time. Maybe ask more about the religion and provide a safe space for them to speak freely about it. Little things like that can go a long way.", "I also assumed he's Muslim and then he can make the prayer later if he has an appointment.", "I told him the new appointment and asked him if its within his schedule. He said its ok so I hope next time it works out", "He is 16 and lives here for about a year now", "My actions were never meant as an insult to his religion.

For us it was important to finally know what was going on with his lid", "Yes to be fair, I could have asked. Wasnt in my mind in that situation.", "Because it isn't pertanant to the story?

How would he know the importance of being on time if it hadn\u2019t been explained to him, you knew prayer is a priority and lateness was normal in his culture?

He a kid and acting like one. He's in a relatively new place where the times of those events are different. So yeah there's a adjustment period", "To him its common knowledge and probably doesn't need to be said. The same way you thought about doctors appointment times being struct. \"Everyone knows this so I wont mention it\"", ">it can also be an african refugee who fled because of poverty.\n\nIn what universe is that not traumatic?", "Sounds like a case of miscommunication then imo. Whoever scheduled should have checked with him to ensure it would be do-able and ultimately you got caught in the middle of that.", "I reminded him early that day that his appointment is at 3pm and it seemed fine there as he stated that he knows. He is with us for around a year now so he should know the importance of appointment or my whole team did something wrong here. So yes, I more or less assumed he should be aware considering he isnt entirely new here.", "Sorry that came of wrong. I meant in the context of the story. He could be jewish, christian, muslim, whatever. Yes, his religion is important to him but its not important to the story", "Of course. Still he had enough time to tell me that at appointment time he has to pray which in his mind is more important then his health. And if thats his opinion I can tell him I think thats wrong but ultimately its his \"problem\". I could have called and asked for a later time (which yes, to be fair i could have done anyway as he was praying) or just try to find a solution with him.", "Defiant is correct. He's a kid, and sometimes very normal expected things go right past those who have different life experiences. If it were me in that situation, I could know and still need help with reminders to get things done in the short period before, because my ADHD means I lose track of time easily. If he lost track of time and didn't want to miss his prayers, then it was just bad luck mostly, but if it hasn't been an issue for him to get there on time in the past, he may not have any reason to be aware of the late policy. \n\nIf the lights in a room go off and someone says to just go towards the exit, and there's a red emergency exit sign in one corner- You still have to explicitly tell people where the exit is. My mom is blind, telling her there is an exit is not helpful. That's what you have to keep in mind. It is much better to give directions to the exit to a bunch of people who don't need them than to not give them to the person who does.", "No. \n\nYou have to *explain*.", "And just as you didn\u2019t feel the need to clarify that medical appointments are on strict schedules, he didn\u2019t need to clarify that prayer is on a strict schedule. \n\nBut of the two of you, you\u2019re the adult and the one who decided to \n\na) wait until there were only 10 minutes to get to the appointment (which may be reasonable if it was very close by from a travel standpoint), \n\nb) cancel the appointment (because the difference between when you wanted to leave and when he was ready to leave was only 10 minutes, so if it was that close by, shouldn\u2019t be an issue) and \n\nc) didn\u2019t inform him that waiting those ten minutes would mean that you were going to cancel a medical appointment that he had been waiting a very long time for."]}
