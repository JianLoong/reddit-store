He had opportunity to say I can't do that time.

Maybe he can use this as a learning opportunity that the world won't wait for him no matter how important he perceives what he is doing is.", "I'm... not seeing how what you did was racist. It would've been racist had you forced the child away from prayers. If I'm guessing correctly, it is indeed very important to his religion that those prayers are said at the correct times.\n\nIt's also not racist to conform to the norms of the country you're in. You're right, in most countries, a doctor will cancel an appointment, (and charge a fee, too,) if you don't show up on time.\n\nI'm not sure there was any alternative to the way you handled it.

If he's uk based, then asr prayer had gone and maghrib prayer time not arrived.

Muslims can skip prayers and make up for it later, and it happens pretty regularly. As a Muslim, I've never seen someone around me schedule appointments around prayer times or deliberately be late for an appointment because they were praying. They pray around it. I just simply think the dude forgot about the appointment lol.\n\nYou're not racist nor are you disrespecting his religion. Next time, maybe remind him 1 hour before the appointment and mention that you can't be late or you'll have to cancel the appointment. That's an ample enough warning.", "NTA.

The population you serve - minor refugees- by their nature doesn\u2019t understand the complete culture they are now living in & may not be comfortable or know how to advocate for themselves. Part of sheltering & supporting them is teaching them things they need to know to live here, & whoever managed the appointment dropped the ball.\n\nYou were probably wrong to cancel the appointment, especially 10 minutes before the appointment time. I have been to many doctors where being late was no issue at all. They run behind schedule or they just go on to the next appointment & come back  to late comers when they\u2019re there. For doctors who do run a tight schedule, canceling 10 minutes before an appointment is not better than being late.

Could bring up how you respect his religious needs and apologize for how it made him feel and that you recognize that you weren't in a completely clear head at the time.

He's a kid, and sometimes very normal expected things go right past those who have different life experiences. If it were me in that situation, I could know and still need help with reminders to get things done in the short period before, because my ADHD means I lose track of time easily. If he lost track of time and didn't want to miss his prayers, then it was just bad luck mostly, but if it hasn't been an issue for him to get there on time in the past, he may not have any reason to be aware of the late policy. \n\nIf the lights in a room go off and someone says to just go towards the exit, and there's a red emergency exit sign in one corner- You still have to explicitly tell people where the exit is.

If he's Muslim, my understanding is that he has to stop everything 3X a day at very specific times to turn to Mecca and pray.

He's ignorant of the medical system. Most doctors offices won't see you if you are late and also charge a no-show fee for the wasted appointment slot. It's also disrespectful to the doctor and other patients waiting for an appointment. Canceling 10 min prior means no chance to bring in a patient on a wait-list.", "NTA.

I wish you would've called the doctor's office to explain that you'll be late to the appointment due to the patient having to pray.

It's very disrespectfull towards the doctors and to other patients ou could have benefited from the cancelation (you couldn't plan it this time, I get it). You are NTA towards the kid. I understand he has to pray, he could have told you that when you booked the apointment. It's a regular thing to do in the country I live and work and, trust me, I heard a lot and praying is definitely the most \"normal\" thing I heard. It's better to be \"picky\" (not the exact word I think but English isn't my first language) than to cancel last minute.", "Question, how much do we know about this kids history? You said you told him earlier that day the time of the doctors appointment, but he still chose to wait until right before the time to begin his prayer. As others have noted, a doctors appointment would be a valid reason to defer prayer or pray earlier. It sounds like he might actually be avoiding going to the doctor, but is trying to avoid dealing with his own feelings by deflecting the responsibility for the missed appointment onto you. It might be worth exploring whether he has had some healthcare-related trauma. \n\nA lot of kids who enter other countries as refugees, without their parents no less, have a degree of trauma. As a pediatric nurse in a city with a large refugee population, I\u2019ve come to expect extreme reactions, even upon just walking in the room, from kids who\u2019ve had to make the journey with their parents. And it makes me wonder wtf we\u2019re subjecting these families to upon entry to the US, because these young ones (7 and under) just seem so incredibly traumatized.", "Maybe he did it on purpose because he really doesn't want to go? It's so baffling he let you remind him numerous times and didn't say anything I am struggling to understand it.", "But the requirement for Islam is \u201cpray five times a day\u201d not \u201cat 2PM\u201d. The kid could have rearranged his prayer schedule", "Ok but she told him about the appointment well before and he said it was fine, she gave him every chance to say oh by the way I have prayers at that time. Sounds like she did everything right and he was just rude by not communicating to her that he was unavailable at that time.Like others have said, if he is Muslim, he could have done his prayers later, if not, he should have told her he was unavailable and should tell her the exact times he has to pray so that this doesn't re-occur if he is incapable of communicating this himself.It's not like she sprung it on him 10mins before.Likewise he could have said okay that's fine we have waited months for this very important appointment but we will need to get there early so I can pray beforehand.If the kid comes from a country where being late is no big deal I understand why they may have thought this would be okay but surely it would have been clear that OP was stating we are going at this time your appointment is at 3 etc and likewise the understanding that you are somewhere new where things are done differently.Usually I give kids leeway and we don't know the age of this person but sounds like OP did so much to make this kid aware of what was happening and he didn't have a clue. He's been in the country for at minimum half a year at this point so I'm surprised they hadn't learned some of the local customs by this time.\n\nNTA", "Did you state what time you need to leave the house or be in the car?\n\nMost likely, his thought process was something along the lines of:\n\n\u201cYes, 3pm is just fine.  I will do my prayers and then we will leave.\u201d  \n\nEspecially coming from a place that puts the importance on religion above all others, the prayer becomes more important than the doctor.\n\nAdditionally, doctors offices are notorious for running behind, which means he has time to pray and won\u2019t have to wait as long since they are already behind.\n\nHe\u2019s not purposefully disrespecting your time.  Just as you aren\u2019t purposefully disrespecting his religion.  But you both think the other are because you grew up/learned different societal norms and what is/isn\u2019t important in the hierarchical order.", "It is because the prayer rules for Muslims is different from Christians or Jews"]}
