The funeral became a shitshow and my wife, her siblings, along with their mom's parents and siblings, publicly announced this to everyone until they left the funeral and had it made clear that my wife and her siblings would be going home with their grandparents and not them (wife was 16 at the time and the youngest).\n\nJune of last year my wife got a call to tell her that her father had been taken to hospital and was unlikely to survive.

We don't know if the mom knew and wanted the family to stay together or anything. The reason I'm pointing this out is because 10 years later the dad STILL was in a relationship with the best friend and had children with her. It doesn't sound like a complete cheating a-hole but someone who found love and just maybe there was something really wrong with his previous marriage. I understand this came out very wrong while the mom was dying and at her funeral. But we DO miss many details from that part of the backstory.\n\nOf course there's absolutely no obligation taking in the children.
