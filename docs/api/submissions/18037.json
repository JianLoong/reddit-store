We were both happy she asked, but I did have some concerns.\n\nOur daughter is low needs autistic, meaning she can usually cope fine with most situation, but sometimes she needs extra help.

Either way I didn't want to assume anything, and said we'd talk to her about it.\n\nWe did talk to her that day, and she had a lot of questions about it which we answered. In the end, we showed her the video of my in-law's wedding, where my wife was the flower girl, just to give her an idea. At that point I wasn't shocked when she said she didn't wanna do it, but my wife brushed it off basically saying \"Oh you'll do fine\" so I pulled her aside to have a discussion.\n\nShe said at this point it'd be rude to make her sister find someone else, and besides it's nothing to worry about. She even said that if she does cry people will just think it's funny/cute, and I might be TA for telling her that was a fucked up thing to say. She even argued that this would be good exposure therapy for her, but she finally agreed when I wouldn't back down, provided I tell my SIL.\n\nI did and she completely understood, she even felt guilty for asking when I explained why.

I'm glad you stood your ground on this one.", "I have had enough internet for today. Catering to a child? Finding it cute or funny that a child cries from being terrified? Dude, is your wife this obtuse and gross all the time?

But you are not the AH in this situation.", "NTA but your wife is a massive AH. \n\nHow incredibly cruel to be ok putting your child in a situation that you\u2019re expecting to be traumatizing and thinking others will be freaking entertained by the traumatized response?!? What the actual hell. \n\nYou were 100% right - that was a seriously fucked up thing for her to say or think.", "**NTA**\n\nI would say you did everything right. \n\nHowever, I am concerned that your wife thought it would be okay if your daughter cried because people would think it would be cute or funny. That\u2019s not cool.", "NTA: You did the right thing by listening to your daughter. This could have been a really uncomfortable experience for her. Personally I think that would be awful for exposure therapy. That\u2019s just too much attention on her with her condition.", "NTA.

This isn't therapeutic, it's child abuse.\n\nIf I were you I'd get my wife into couples therapy with a therapist who has special knowledge about special needs children and get her a whole lot of parenting information, advice, and support.  Your wife is either extremely ignorant of what's good for autistic children, or she's in denial,  or she just doesn't give a damn.  \n\nThe notion that not forcing your child to do something you know would undermine her well-being is tantamount to \"catering to a child\" is such fragrant B.S., there are fumes coming off my screen.  \n\nYour wife is the A here, big time.  As for you, thank God your daughter's got you.  Should this marriage end, please fight for custody.  NTA", "You did good", "NTA -- you put your child's needs first.", "NTA.

It will be like this!\"\n\nYou break it down into small parts.   Can she try on this dress for five minutes?  How about sixty seconds?  We can all count together, then we can take it off and (YAY!) put on our favorite clothes again.\n\nParenting an autistic child at any spot on the spectrum is NOT best done by ultimatums or by inflexible positions.   It requires everybody being on the same page and looking for ways to help the child see that what looks like a huge chasm is actually a series of small stepping-stones.\n\nIf the parents aren't willing to take the child by the hand over the stepping-stones, the list of things that can be accomplished confidently and joyfully shrinks a lot.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're being a good parent by explaining what it would entail and respecting your daughter's decision. \n\nPlease spend some time thinking about your wife's interactions with your daughter and the decisions she is making for her.
