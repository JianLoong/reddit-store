Exposure therapy would be slowly building up tolerance to being around the thing you hate in a safe place where you have the ability to back out and regulate when it gets too much. Properly building up tolerance to any ONE of the issues the child has is one thing (like trying the fancy clothes on beforehand with compression clothing layers, timing how long she can stand it, and allowing them to change clothes when they are reaching their limit) but throwing them into the deep end of all of them without and support to deal with them is NOT OK. \n\nLet's compare to arachnophobia. Forcing your child to do this when they have expressed they don't want to is basically like having an arachnophobic person say \"I don't want to go into the bugs and spider exhibit at the zoo because I know it'll trigger me\" and then getting forced to go inside by the people they thought they trusted. Oh, and the \"people will just think it's funny/cute\" is like them getting laughed at when they a breakdown due to their arachnophobia.

When autistic people and children have meltdowns, and cry, it is because they have been in pain for so long they physically can\u2019t take it anymore. Imagine the amount of physical pain that it would take for you, as an adult, to cry from it. That is what we feel.\n\nPeople who think we can \u2018deal with it\u2019 or \u2018get over it\u2019 are still viewing it from their mindset, and their experiences. They think it\u2019s like having a rock in their shoe, or being a bit upset about something not going their way. It is not. Autistic people don\u2019t have unreasonable reactions to everyday discomfort, we have reasonable reactions to the pain that discomforts (which are normal to NT people) cause us.\n\nIt is concerning that your wife is okay with your daughter being put in a situation that will make her cry, and that she thinks people might find it \u2018cute\u2019. I\u2019m sure she does not intend it in the callous, uncaring way it comes across, but I hope you can show or explain this to her, to allow her to show some empathy for her daughter.\n\nAs an autistic person, our lives can be more difficult because of it, but also intensely rewarding and fulfilling because of it. Don\u2019t let your child\u2019s first challenges with her neurotype be her parents reaction to it.", "What exactly is exposure therapy? This sounds like something people who get their health advice off Tiktok would do. NTA!", "There is absolutely nothing cute about putting a child in a situation she can't handle and doesn't want to be a part of. NTA", "NTA and it is absolutely pathetic that YOU need to tell your wife's sister rather than your wife doing it herself.  Tbh I find this whole thing very concerning in terms of your wife.", "Nta this could\u2019ve been traumatic for you daughter. She set down her boundaries and said she wasn\u2019t comfortable with it. Your wife should be understanding of that. She\u2019s a major AH for not considering how your daughter feels and putting others before her.", "NTA, but uh, is your wife good? Like that is that childs mother and she is pointing out some really disgusting behavior.", "NTA. It seems your wife thinks your child is less of a person because she isn\u2019t an adult. I\u2019d ask your daughter how your wife treats her when you\u2019re not around. Exposure therapy isn\u2019t a thing, and forcing her to be a flower girl when she doesn\u2019t want to be could be very traumatizing. And as a person without kids who attended a wedding with young flower girls, it was not \u201ccute\u201d when they started crying. Anything they did to detract attention from the bride was annoying. So on behalf of the other wedding guests, I say thank you for your forethought.", "You are 100% right, it's fucked up that your wife said your autistic daughter being in distress would be cute or funny. Also, her exposure therapy comment is bullshit and I'm sure she knows it. Exposure therapy should only be conducted under the guidance of a licensed mental health practitioner and I'm guessing your wife didn't consult one before making her ignorant comment.\n\n\n\nNTA keep standing up for your daughter. You're a good dad and your kid is lucky to have you.", "NTA. Your wife sounds like she doesn't really believe your daughter is autistic. There is nothing cute about a crying child in a wedding party. Thank you and SIL for being decent people and not forcing her to endure something awful. Your wife is kinda shady, so you need to be your daughter's advocate.", "NTA. It is concerning that your wife see's you supporting your autistic daughters wishes as 'catering to a child' - of course you dont want to put your daughter in a stressful situation. Also, your daughter has made her feelings on the matter clear so your wife should respect tht.", "NTA\n\nI think you did the right thing. Try and ask your SIL if you're daughter could be accommodated in any way like her being able to wear more comfortable clothes, a choice of safe foods if she has sensory issues with those or bring her sound canceling headphones or fidget toys. They'd help alot, I'm a low needs autistic female as well and attended all three of my older siblings' weddings. All at different parts of my life and those things helped a ton. Even coloring books are great occupiers.", "NTA. Your wife is DEFINITELY the a-hole. Wow. I'm at a loss for words. You should let her read these comments. She needs a wake up call.", "Exposure therapy doesn't do anything for a little kid with sensory issues. I tried forcing myself through social situations that i was terrified of. It never helped before i got older - because when i was a child i had no idea how to process negative emotions.\n\nAnd what's wrong with \"catering to a child\"? You should talk to your wife about personal autonomy, the idea that it's cute to watch a kid in distress and completely ok to make them go through stress for adults' amusement is so last century. It's actually dangerous to not teach them how to put boundaries and have them respected. Your daughter didn't make a scene ffs she just doesn't want to be in a wedding party. Even adults sometimes decline for similar reasons.\n\nYour kid is lucky to have you.", "I\u2019m super concerned about the wife\u2019s treatment of the child. I also feel like she\u2019s not concerned about family drama, but upset that she\u2019s having to deal with her actual child rather than the fairy Princess ideal she was hoping for. \n\nAbsolutely NTA OP\u2026 keep taking your child\u2019s side. You\u2019re doing this right.", "Seriously! And for his wife to say he was \"causing drama by catering to a child\" is a really fucked up thing to say about your own child.", "A full-on meltdown is anything but cute. Auntie will find that out real quick", "I had a friend when I was a kid who had a pet tarantula in their room. They knew I was arachnophobic (like deadly afraid of them (still am to this day)), so they always made sure to keep their door shut and kept me away from their room (pretending it wasn't there even though I knew it was helped a little). However, said friend's mom caught wind of my phobia and, for whatever reason, thought that not only going into her child's room without permission was okay, but that taking the massive spider out of its enclosure and into the living room where we were playing video games and trying to corner me with it was a good idea. Safe to say that friend only ever came to my house for hang outs after that.", "Ugh! What an awful woman! I'm so sorry!", "Yeah. My friend was furious with her after the fact. Partly because of my phobia and partly because apparently the spider was old and didn't really like being handled to begin with. He handled my phobia the sensible way by keeping me away from where the spider was. She apparently thought that since I was friends with her son, I shouldn't be arachnophobic.", "NTA. Don't leave your daughter with your wife anymore. She's willing to undermine her own child's feelings to please random people.", "NTA. As parent of an autistic kid (son) I also wouldn\u2019t put him through that if he was uncomfortable. It could be fine but if the child is not comfortable you\u2019re risking a full-blown meltdown and traumatizing the kid to hate weddings.", ">She even said that if she does cry people will just think it's funny/cute, and I might be TA for telling her that was a fucked up thing to say. She even argued that this would be good exposure therapy for her, but she finally agreed when I wouldn't back down, provided I tell my SIL.\n\nOne) The way some adults think a childs suffering is cute **is fucked up.** Hell, I've seen people chuckling over the distressed look of an infant boy after going through circumcision not long after being born. It's legit screwed up to see someone's pain and agony and say, \"ooohhh isn't that cute, their suffering is so pitiful and meaningless to us\\~\" Two) Your wife isn't a therapist, she doesn't get to determine what is \"good exposure therapy\" for a child, because she doesn't know shit about that. However, she clearly holds the idea that your daughter is \"difficult\" and it would be in everyone else's best interest if she was forced to \"deal with it.\" A not uncommon mentality for parents with autistic kids unfortunately.\n\nAlso this didn't cause any drama, the only drama was a result of your wife being more focused on image and \"not being rude\" to a grown adult who will understand than considering your childs needs. Is your wife even your daughters biomom? She's showing a startling lack of consideration for her...does she have some screwed up detachment from her because of the autism?\n\nNTA", "NTA, but you will be if you do not find some way to force your wife to educate herself on your daughter's disability *stat*. Your daughter has you to advocate for her, but her mother's lack of understanding and interest in responsibly managing your child's autism is a serious red flag. I would suggest looking for a parenting class or something similar directed at parents of autistic children, because your wife sounds like every boomer parent from the 80s, even though we know better now.", "Your wife\u2019s behaviour is pretty monstrous. You\u2019re NTA", "NTA", "<<She even said that if she does cry people will just think it's funny/cute>>\n\nThere is nothing funny or cute about deliberately making a child uncomfortable.", "NTA, but holy shit there are a LOT of red flags waving with your wife\u2019s attitude and comments.", "As someone who was the child in this situation, HUGE NTA. You are being a good parent. I was forced to be a bridesmaid against my wishes, and spent the whole day miserable and terrified. Years later, when I asked my mother why she'd agreed to it when she knew how much I'd hate it, she said: \"Well, I couldn't have said no, could I? It would've hurt your cousin's feelings.\" I said: \"What about my feelings?\" She just shrugged and said: \"Kids have to do things they don't like.\"", "I have a high functioning neurotypical kid & being a flower girl was super stressful even for her.  There are so many expectations put on those kids\u2026 Waiting patiently while hair and makeup is done\u2026 Being available for pictures\u2026 Posing for pictures\u2026 All the awkward chats with adults\u2026 I did it once, and I would never put my perfectly normal kid through that again.", "NTA You\u2019re an amazing parent 10/10 I\u2019m being so serious rn as an autistic person who\u2019s needs and feelings were ignored growing up bless you . Seriously", "NTA, and keep a good eye on how your wife treats your daughter.", "This right here. Super alarming when a parent is minimizing her condition. Do you think she\u2019d decide on her own to \u201cexpose\u201d your daughter to uncomfortable situations when you\u2019re not around? \n\nI don\u2019t know your wife, but I get hints of \u201cI\u2019m going to prove it\u2019s no big deal\u201d vibes based on her reaction.", "Agreed. Also, SIL would not be thrilled if her flower girl cries and runs off. Is the wife insane? NTA.", "She's only concerned about the appearances in this situation. Daughter crying is ok because guests will think it's funny. Telling SIL that she won't do it is not ok, because SIL will think badly of them (even though she doesn't, the problem is even the slight possibility that she is secretly mad.) Letting the daughter make her own choice is not ok, because people will judge them for \"catering to a child\". My parents had similar ideas, as most parents of my peers, it was always so weird (in a good way) to be in the presence of an adult who actually cared about what the kids feel and want to do. Most adults would tell you to do things just because, with the same mindset - \"what will the neighbors say, that i can't control my child!\" I'm in my 30s and i love to see that it slowly changes around here.", "Just FYI, we've moved away from terms like high functioning and low functioning. It's more ND affirming to say low support needs and high support needs. :)", "And this is how it should be. Their relationship will only grow stronger, as SIL offered and then respected the daughter's wishes.", "I lose track I really do! I work in an Autistic school and still got confused when someone told me the term Asperger is no longer used lol. It's such a fluid topic it's hard to keep up sometimes.", "I was thinking  it would be the bride is an asshole  because  daughter said no...but your wife is.\n\nBride was fine and had another girl  be the flower girl.\n\nSo if your wife cries  because she's upset or scared, it will be ok if you laugh  because it's cute??\n\nNTA", "Nta she shouldn't be forced to do something she doesn't want to do .ur wife needs to stop with her shit", "NTA - Please never change and continue being an advocate for your child always.  She will remember you always giving her that agency.", "People really need to watch more Criminal Minds lol. They did two episodes on people who were treated with this method incorrectly. Yes it\u2019s a show but so many of their episodes are based on actual crimes and the reasons.", "Your wife is probably not fit to be around her for long periods of time. That's all", "NTA. I'm a little worried about your wife's attitude, though. Her lack of understanding about autism is concerning.", "Nta. What kind of sick individual thinks it's funny to watch an obviously traumatized child cry????", "I'll never understand how people don't get that children are human beings with their own wants and should be catered to as much as anyone else.", "Ok everyone in this thread is way too sensitive. Let a child do what they want and shy away from the world then, good luck working on getting rid of social anxiety fears. Expose them to the environment. The wife is right, this is good exposure therapy. America is way too sensitive. I don\u2019t even have to ask, I already know. Everyone here is acting like she\u2019s a thin piece of paper lol. She\u2019ll be fine. Let her experience being a flower girl. Just because a kid can make decisions for themselves doesn\u2019t mean they always should. Sometimes an adult knows better."]}
