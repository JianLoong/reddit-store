Obviously only you know the level of your pain, so if you do think you could have pushed through by upping the meds and did not take her wedding that seriously, then sure, feel guilty.  But you told her your pain level, what did she expect you to do?

My endometriosis was so bad and on top of that I had PCOS so at times the pain was excruciating and my periods were really really heavy with clotting. So gross I know. They progressively got longer and closer together. 10-14 days long, 20 days apart. I lived on 4-8 Advil every 4 hours for a couple of years. I finally saw a specialist who told me (after both a regular ultrasound and vaginal ultrasound) that my scarring and adhesions were so severe my female organs were in a tight ball. And I had huge cysts in both ovaries. The end result was a complete surgical hysterectomy, including both ovaries and my cervix at age 40. Hope you get treatment but remember every surgery you have to clean up adhesions creates more adhesions and scar tissue. Which causes more complications. It\u2019s a vicious cycle. But don\u2019t go into early age hysterectomy lightly. The effect on hormones has left me still experiencing hot flashes 20 (!) years later!", "INFO: Are they always quite this bad? If so, I'm confused to how you expected to power through your sister's wedding and hide it  while on heavy pain killers, maybe throwing up and in extreme pain?

And in any case, you'd still have been in unimaginable pain during the wedding festivities - why would you fly out knowing that you'd probably miss most of the important things curled up in bed feeling like death   \n'Surely you should have got better painkillers / treatment by now' - yeah right, because doctors in the UK will absolutely dole out very high strength pain medication for 'women's issues'. Newsflash, no they don't. \n\nYou are not an Arsehole for this. You are not at fault whatsoever. You are dealing with a horrible disease, where the only real treatment (full hysterectomy) is terrible for so many reasons, not least because they just will not do this unless there are other (life-threatening, usually) complications, and because they think that women should want to have children so even when women beg for this, they won't do it until the woman is old enough for this not to matter.\n\nYour sister, and the rest of your family, need to do a lot of reading, learning, thinking and apologising, if they are giving you a hard time over this. \n\nI hope that you can get better treatment very soon, and I wish you well. My mother, sister and aunt all had severe endometriosis, and I have seen what it can be like.
