But you told her your pain level, what did she expect you to do?

My endometriosis was so bad and on top of that I had PCOS so at times the pain was excruciating and my periods were really really heavy with clotting. So gross I know. They progressively got longer and closer together. 10-14 days long, 20 days apart. I lived on 4-8 Advil every 4 hours for a couple of years. I finally saw a specialist who told me (after both a regular ultrasound and vaginal ultrasound) that my scarring and adhesions were so severe my female organs were in a tight ball. And I had huge cysts in both ovaries. The end result was a complete surgical hysterectomy, including both ovaries and my cervix at age 40. Hope you get treatment but remember every surgery you have to clean up adhesions creates more adhesions and scar tissue. Which causes more complications. It\u2019s a vicious cycle. But don\u2019t go into early age hysterectomy lightly. The effect on hormones has left me still experiencing hot flashes 20 (!) years later!", "INFO: Are they always quite this bad?

And in any case, you'd still have been in unimaginable pain during the wedding festivities - why would you fly out knowing that you'd probably miss most of the important things curled up in bed feeling like death   \n'Surely you should have got better painkillers / treatment by now' - yeah right, because doctors in the UK will absolutely dole out very high strength pain medication for 'women's issues'. Newsflash, no they don't. \n\nYou are not an Arsehole for this. You are not at fault whatsoever. You are dealing with a horrible disease, where the only real treatment (full hysterectomy) is terrible for so many reasons, not least because they just will not do this unless there are other (life-threatening, usually) complications, and because they think that women should want to have children so even when women beg for this, they won't do it until the woman is old enough for this not to matter.\n\nYour sister, and the rest of your family, need to do a lot of reading, learning, thinking and apologising, if they are giving you a hard time over this. \n\nI hope that you can get better treatment very soon, and I wish you well.

This isn't a 'slight' inconvience and based on your comment alone, I bet you've never actually experienced severe pain with your endo otherwise you'd know that just powering through is sometimes physically NOT possible. How the fuck was she supposed to get on a plane in this condition, let alone be apart of all the wedding festivities then fly home? On top of that, there are other issues like heavy bleeding, that make it impossible to go anywhere without risking a leak. Can you imagine having to change a tampon, diva cup or multiple pads in an airplane toilet and having to clean up all the blood and not get it everywhere?

What she is not allowed to do though, is treat her sister like this and act like she's not coming because she has a papercut. She lost the whole fucking arm, metaphorically speaking. \n\nJust because you can power through and your suffering isn't as bad, or doesn't affect you as deeply, you do not have the right to minimise others suffering and pain and make it seem like it's less than it is.

So my sympathies, the least men could do is take a step back and actually think about what a period entails and then apply that some women have excruciating pain in addition. It\u2019s truly horrific to think about on a medical scale but normalised because of the baby making indoctrination. \n\nCouldn\u2019t for a moment pretend to know how it feels but I have since learned of many close female friends and coworkers who suffer through every month. Heat packs at work etc, still expected to give presentations when they can barely walk. It\u2019s fucked! I\u2019m so sorry to anyone who is dealing with it.

This comment is extremely insensitive.", "I don't even have endo and I'm still really distressed by the \"Well, I did it so you can too\" comments.", "The OP's actually British. She would have been travelling to the US.", "A hysterectomy is more of a treatment for adenomyosis. \n\nHowever, if you remove the uterus and ovaries, but do not excise (not ablate, ablation makes endo worse) every single microscopic piece of endo, which may include stage 3 and stage 4 attachments in places that you can\u2019t always cut into, then you will still have endometriosis. And it will grow with each menstrual cycle.\n\nThis is because the endo-attachments outside the uterus produce their own estrogen and have their own hormonal cycles that still continue after the ovaries have been removed. This is also why hormonal birth control doesn\u2019t work for a lot endo patients, especially estrogen based hormones. \n\nEndo has been found attached to and even infiltrating the kidneys, liver, gi tract, anus, lungs, diaphragm, eyes, brain, heart, stomach, skin, and pancreas, just to name a few. You cannot cut into all those places to get all the deep infiltrating endometriosis without fully damaging a vital organ. So in these cases, a hysterectomy wouldn\u2019t always be best. \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t mean any offense by any of this, it\u2019s an extremely common and very harmful misconception that birth control and/or a hysterectomy are the main (successful) treatments for endometriosis (but again, a hysterectomy is the treatment for adenomyosis.) Unfortunately, this misconception, and the lack of education and funding for research about the disease, is why so many endometriosis patients have medical PTSD. \n\nAlso, in addition to a hysterectomy not being a cure-all, every microscopic piece isn\u2019t excised, endometriosis may still always grow back, even post-hysterectomy.\n\nEndometriosis excision surgery has been proven in the last 15 years or so to be a better treatment than a hysterectomy, in a lot of cases, the best treatment for endometriosis when one doesn\u2019t also have adenomyosis. However, excision surgery still not the cure-all for everyone and can cause more issues for some. And a lot of endo patients have to have multiple in their lives. \n\nUnfortunately, both hysterectomies and endo excision surgeries (and even outdated ablation surgeries) are considered \u201celective\u201d surgeries a lot of times, which means the patient is paying out of pocket, even though it\u2019s classified as one of the top ten pain diseases in the world and one of the leading causes of infertility. This is sadly due to a history of health systems underpricing women\u2019s health surgeries and underfunding research for women\u2019s issues. Not to mention the very sexist and outdated theories that \u201cwomen can tolerate/live with pain if it\u2019s not killing them\u201d mentalities. (These are the same mentalities that used to operate on infants without anesthesia because they didn\u2019t believe babies could feel pain back like 60 years or so.) A lot of times, American insurances will pay doctors out the same amount for a 45 minute ablation surgery and a 4 hour excision surgery.\n\nDue to this, there are not a ton of endometriosis specialists or endo excision specialists (which endo excision off the uterus can be akin to brain surgery, btw, in terms of complexity.) Also, American insurances do not always cover the procedures. And you can be put one years long waiting lists in countries that only have like 1-2 endometriosis specialists in the entire country, which are a LOT of countries.\n\nAdditionally, and this is just a \u201cfun\u201d endo fact, it takes endo patients an average of 7 years to get diagnosed (and again, acquire ptsd.) This is due to everything a mention above AND the issues with endometriosis diagnosis, particularly imaging. \n\nCT scans, ultrasounds, MRIs, and other like imaging are designed to see through the uterine tissue, not detect it. Using contrasts dye isn\u2019t always helpful for it usually is run through the closed circuit blood system and specific organs, when endo lives in the cavities between organs. And there are different types of endo lesions. Usually only cystic endometriosis is shown on ultrasounds, not powder burn lesions. \n\nWith Pelvic MRIs, unless the imaging center is using vaginal and anal contrast gel, in addition to intravenous contrast AND the images are reviewed by a radiologist that can actually detect endo, they are not going to find anything and the patient will be given a false negative. Think about it, if you are using a machine that uses sound waves to make an image and you have an empty cavity in the center of that pelvic MRI, a cavity that you are specifically trying to see in detail and directly around, wouldn\u2019t you fill that cavity with contrast gel to have a better image? Ive only found one healthcare system out of seven that actually did vaginal contrast gel. (There are some really great medical journal articles on its successful usage.) \n\nLUCKILY, there has been an extreme lack of funding for research for a this disease that affects 1 in 10 women. Luckily in the past 4 years, there has  been some amazing research coming out of Japan, China, and UK. I mean, even the US FINALLY put some money into endo research only in 2020. \n\nThe more you know! :)", "Thank you. Hopefully we'll have better treatments in the future\ud83d\udc96"]}
