About a year or so ago, an intense situation occurred where she finally put down the bottle and said \u201cno more\u201d I even told her to her face I didn\u2019t believe her when she said this was the last straw (you just have to know to understand my harshness) but here she is proving me ALL the way wrong. I am truly at a loss for words at how incredible the whole thing is, and I beam with pride at this new person I see in front of me. This is an entire lifetime coming. \n\nFast forward to end of July and I know this month (Aug)will be her one year mark. So I was thinking of doing something really cool for her. I came across the Cameo website and decided this would be the way to go after searching the site and previewing a couple. I got a customized video from Dave Mustaine (she is a HUGE Megadeth fan) congratulating her on her sobriety and telling her to keep it up, that her family loves and supports her, etc etc. The video was actually really nice and worth the money I paid for it, and I was excited to show it to her. \n\nYesterday, as she was getting off of work I set the family TV up in the living room with the video set up so I could sit her down and play it, instead of having her watch on a phone. Also, I wanted to use my phone to record her reaction. I got everything set up, and after she got settled in from work I sat her down on the couch and told her I had something for her. I played the video. She originally smiled upon seeing Dave but as soon as he began to speak about her sobriety and the congrats and like, her face fell and she began to cry. I was confused at first and thought they were happy tears, but she got up and left the living room without saying a word and that\u2019s when I knew something was wrong. \n\nShe ran into her bedroom (which she shares with my father) and didn\u2019t come out for a long while. I was still confused so I left her alone for the time being. Only after my dad came out and I asked him what happened earlier, did he sit me down and tell me that my mom had actually relapsed at around month 7 (only once-has been sober since) and that she\u2019s been harboring feelings of shame and guilt about it..so my \u201cgift\u201d sent her over the edge. \n\nMy dad began to berate me, saying I should have never gotten her a gift and that I was essentially making everything worse by making a big deal about one of her milestones, especially in such a grandiose way. And that you don\u2019t ever know what people are going through so this was wrong of me, and could essentially trigger her into relapsing knowing how sensitive my mom is to the topic. This truly wasn\u2019t my intention, but now I\u2019m feeling extremely guilty and worried for my mom. I probably should have checked in with my dad before hand, but was it wrong of me to try and celebrate something I thought was important? Or am I just a dumb ass and this is truly something you shouldn\u2019t do?My mom has been distant with me since.", "created_utc": 1692111476, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15rv2au/aita_for_making_my_mother_cry_with_the_tactless/", "score": 1698, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Please let Mom know that you did not know about the momentary relapse and you are still proud of her success. Hopefully she will eventually see the joy and pride that went it to choosing such an awesome gift.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThere's absolutely nothing wrong with your intentions. You were proud of you mom and her accomplishments, and you wanted to give her something unique to celebrate them. You didn't know what was going on, and that's not your fault. \n\nWhat you can do is: you can apologise to your mom for not checking with your dad beforehand, and next time, you'll know that 1) she would prefer if these milestones go by without celebrations, as she feels pressured, and; 2) that you should always ask your dad before taking decisions like this\n\nstill, you weren't in the wrong at all, and I find it unfair of your father to put the blame on you like this", "NTA relapse is part of recovery. It still marks a year that she seriously began on her path to recovery.", "How were you supposed to know about her relapse?  It\u2019s very easy for people to relapse without anyone else knowing.\n\nNTA", "No, NTA, you had good intentions and nobody told you she fell off the wagon", "how the hell were you supposed to know she relapsed? you did a sweet thing, and your father berating you is way undeserved. you had no way of knowing this would trigger her guilt over her relapse. NTA", "NTA, this is based on some of the other comments I read but I think it would be really great to sit your mum down and tell her you are proud of her for trying, 7 months from nothing is no joke and really inspiring. Relapse is part of the path to sobriety and you will hold onto the video for now and regift it once she reaches her 1y. Because she has shown the strength to get there and you believe she will - when she does you will be there to celebrate with her. If she tries again and relapses again she should forgive herself and never give up trying.", "NTA. You didnt know and your intention was to celebrate a positive thing. I would agree with your hindsight and talk to your dad/her about it in the future.", "NTA. The thought and intention were lovely and there's no way you could have known - she probably wouldn't have known how she would react if you'd asked her before either. Sometimes we can be taken by surprise by our own feelings. I'm sure once she has a chance to think it through she'll feel differently.", "NTA. Your father had no right to berate you and try to make you feel guilty. Perhaps your mom has been distant because she feels ashamed, but I'm sure she'll come around. Absolutely NTA though.", "NTA - she's sad because the relapsed and that's embarrassing, not because of your gift. Tell her to try again and you can play the video again for her on her new 1yr anniversary.", "NTA. As far as I know, people in sobriety *generally* appreciate the support, encouragement, and celebration from their loved ones. It's effing hard work to maintain your sobriety. How could you have known she had a disruption that would change her perception of this? Unfortunately, I guess this doesn't really mark a one-year anniversary after all (presumably the clock starts ticking anew from the relapse date?), but if that hadn't been shared with you, you were simply operating under the information you had. \n\nI will say this whole 'film everything!' vibe from social media is a tad annoying. IDK if that played a role here but it does seem like you put your mom on the spot and created a spectacle that she might not have been comfortable with, and that exacerbated her response. This is a 'know your audience' kind of thing though. But given the sensitivity of the subject, delivering the gift in private, letting her receive it without being filmed, etc. probably would have been better. Still, doesn't make you T A.", "NTA. It was hard for her to share her relapse, but you had good intentions with your gift. I don't think your gift was \"tactless,\" but more inspiring. She sounds quite fragile, but maybe in time, and with family encouragement, she will see the video for what it is: the love and pride of a daughter for her mother.", "NAH\n\nWell maybe your dad. \n\nYou didn\u2019t know she relapsed. You know your mom, does she like this kind of thing? Does she respond to positive feedback? If she hadn\u2019t relapsed do you expect she would have loved the cameo? \n\nI think wanting to show your mom how proud you are of her progress isn\u2019t bad. Your heart was in the right place. \n\nI think your mom\u2019s reaction is natural. I think she needs empathy and support to feel like she can try sobriety again.", "NTA.  Intention is everything here. You didn\u2019t know, and you meant well.", "NTA.  Having lived with several alcoholics (one of which I was briefly married to) in the past, I totally understand where you are coming from and I can almost feel how excited you were to acknowledge and celebrate this milestone with her.  It is her own guilt/shortcomings that have resulted in the tension here.  What you did was sincere and genuine and came from a place of love.  It's understandable that she feels guilt for the relapse.  It would be worse if she didn't.  But you are NOT the bad guy here.  Hopefully she comes out of her shame soon and the 2 of you can discuss and remedy.  Hang in there.  Dealing with alcoholics is hard but if she stays the course, the 2 of you will get through this in tact.  Good Luck.", "NTA, recovery is a hard process and many people relapse or have hiccups, especially in the first year. Your mother made the decision a year ago and besides it being a bumpy road she is staying on it. I am worried about some of your family dynamics, your mother should not be shunned for her relapse, especially since she has been sober since, but she should not be coddled either. I believe your father is an enabler and even though he believes that his actions are based in love, they are detrimental to her continued sobriety. I hope she is not doing this alone and has been seeing professional help or AA. Your father needs to look into some kind of help too, being a loved one of an addict is not an easy road either.", "Gentle YTA for talking about her journey without checking if would be appreciated and for wanting her reaction to be public so you could film it.\n\nPutting her relapse aside for a minute, people should generally be allowed to disclose their sobriety journey at their own time to the people they choose. There will be situations where they absolutely need to disclose certain information but outside of those the specifics and details should be their choice to share. \n\nYour mom is a fan of this person. She admires him. It may seem silly but knowing that he knows this about her might have been enough for this to be uncomfortable.\n\nHer relapse makes any emotions about this even more complicated- she\u2019s receiving accolades for something she didn\u2019t earn, she\u2019s let herself and her family down, and now she\u2019s lying and letting down her favorite artist.\n\nYou tried to do a good thing. You aren\u2019t to blame for her relapse or any relapse she may have in the future. \n\nI hope the message you convey to your mother that even with the relapse you can see she\u2019s actively trying to be better and to make better choices and that all that work and effort is making a positive difference for you, her, and your relationship. That\u2019s the most you can do for her, and even that is a gift - the rest is up to her and is her responsibility, not yours.\n\nTalk to your dad next time before bringing up her sobriety, even positively. And while it\u2019s a complete aside and probably a personal preference, please think twice before making something a spectacle for social media.", "NTA, but you are tactless. You shoudl have just had a video made of Dave sending her bday wishes. Steer well clear of sobriety and addiction discussions unless the person in recovery brings it up.", "NAH. You did not know. It was just a case of miscommunication. It is good you wanted to Support her. \n\nNext time, i think however you should consult with your dad before giving a gift about something that touches on such a loaded topic. \n\nCan you get mustaine to record an apology ? ;)\n\nEdit: also, please leave social media out of it and do not make it such a huge Event. This just Puts a lot of pressure on your mum and can backfire (like it did)", "NTA, your intentions were good. The thing to learn about drunks is that they wield their sobriety like a weapon and everything has to be on their terms or it will be \"your fault\" when they relapse.", "NTA, but now you know. I would talk with her. I would tell her that you were so proud of her and that's why you gave her a gift. I think it's also important to say that you're *still* proud of her. She relapsed once and didnt use it as an excuse to give up. That's commitment. \n\nTell her that you'd love to celebrate her successes with her, but won't plan any more surprises.", "I'm so sorry that you're going through this. Definitely NTA. You didn't know about the relapse. If anything, you were trying to show her that you're proud of her and you were just being supportive and loving. I don't think it was necessary for your dad to berate you like he did. He could've been a little more understanding about your intentions while also explaining that moving forward, there's no cause for celebration unless your mom wants to personally acknowledge any milestones on her sobriety journey. Give your mom all the space she needs to come around. I hope that she does and realizes that your gift wasn't malicious or meant to make her feel bad.", "YTA strictly for this part:\n\n> Also, I wanted to use my phone to record her reaction.\n\nSuddenly the gift isn't about celebrating her milestone, but about you having video you can do what with, exactly?  Post for Internet updoots?\n\nI mean, the Mustaine cameo was a good idea, and it's not your fault addicts lie about relapsing, but maybe learn how to experience important moments while they're happening, not through a camera, and maybe learn that not all important moments are for trying to get meaningless 'likes' from Internet strangers.", "Soft YTA. I just don\u2019t think personal things like sobriety should be made into, like you said in your post, a grandiose gesture. Tactless indeed, but your intentions were good.", "Former alcoholic here, recovery is hard. You don\u2019t know what your mom is going through. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t want a spectacle to be made while I\u2019m on the road to bettering myself. It\u2019s a long, difficult journey. YTA, but your heart was in the right place. Just don\u2019t do it again.", "Yta. For everyone saying \u201chow could she have known\u201d that isn\u2019t really the point. Things like this should not be made into a huge event that\u2019s recorded for social media.", "Soft YTA. Addiction is right up there on the list of the most personal, private things that a person can struggle with, and relapses are common. There's a reason it's Alcoholics ANONYMOUS. You had good intentions but this was an incredibly tone deaf thing to do. Next time just TALK to her, don't set her up - on camera no less - for a big grandiose thing that she may not appreciate or feel is appropriate.", "YT(well-intetioned) Asshole. One of the core ways we help the alcoholics in our lives is by not offering any help or even encouragement that isn't explicitly asked for. And allowing that most of the help an alcoholic is likely to ask for will be from other alcoholics. I can only imagine how shitty it would feel to hear one of your heroes invited into your personal failings. You meant well, but you really hurt her.", "YTA. I mean you didn't do it on purpose but like the old saying, \" the road to hell is paved with good intentions\". Not everyone wants a big deal made of their sobriety, or to talk about it even. Should have just left it with birthday wishes.", "NTA. If no one told you, how were you supposed to know? \n\nWhat you did was very thoughtful and sweet in support of your mom. I understand that she may have been ashamed of her relapse, but you were not made aware of it. I don't understand the reaction from your father, he was a bit harsh...", "Very soft YTA, even though your intentions were good. \n\nEven if she hadn't had a relapse, I don't think telling other people about her (supposedly past) alcoholism was the right move, or all the filming her reaction, etc. Her journey isn't a social media spectacle (and even if you weren't going to make any of the filming public, telling one person, who she was a big fan of, was one person too many.)\n\n**All that being said** one thing being left out of the comments is how hard this whole thing must have been for you. Growing up as a child with an alcoholic parent is terrible. And you deserve compassion for it. I hope you're doing okay.", "NTA.\n\nYou meant well and she should toughen the fuck up. If she relapsed she should take this as a goal to get to.\n\nSupport her in everything you can, but tell her that your gift WILL make sense when she gets to the time period that was mentioned.", "Isn't it kinda a thing with recovering addicts that they're supposed to be honest about how long they've *actually* been sober with their families/support systems? That you didn't know she's only 5 months sober seems like a symptom of a her problem. NTA. \n\nThat was a pretty great gift and, honestly, unpopular opinion here, but 1 drink or episode of drinking in 12 months sounds like recovery to me, I know we have impossible standards for addicts in society where they're never allowed to partake again or they're total failures, but she's gone from probably daily drinking to once in a year - that's a turn around she should be proud of.\n\nEdit: typo", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I've been blamed for relapses.  You mom is an addict, this will be a lifelong struggle.  You genuinely tried to do something nice - if your mom had been honest with you about her journey, it would have been fine.  Try talking to your mom, asking her how you can support her best on her terms.  Keep the door open for her to feel more comfortable opening up to you about her struggles (we call them the white-knuckle-moments) and how her sobriety journey is REALLY going.  It's been a tough lesson for me to learn, to meet the addict on their terms (not mine); to set aside hurt feelings and anger and my own disappointment.  No one is as upset at the addict themselves.  It's SO HARD to listen to tales of drinking, of choosing \"just one glass of wine\" that leads to a 3 day bender, and NOT JUDGE - just offer support.  But you can do it.

Okay, back to square one - which is FINE. But it\u2019s up to her to put on her big girl pants and take accountability - which includes letting people know.

If someone did something like this for me, I'd watch it often to remind me of the people who love me and would miss me and hurt if I died.

Eggshells are not the best to walk on, and it is by no way your fault. If she decides to try to quit again she'll be thankful for what you had done, but for now if she's drinking all there will be is excuses and deflection of blame, because that is how alcoholics are when they are drinking.

Especially since she's back on the wagon she fell off of. It's not like she didn't quit again. It happens. Addiction is hard. She got back up again and when she was a month sober again or so I feel like she should have told you. Lesson learned though. Maybe she will be more open.

I've been in and out of NA and AA meetings most of my childhood/early teen years because of various family members\u2026 I've seen too many of those not 100% focused and sincere about recovery getting loaded/drunk with each other, and it may be too tempting to her if she's still sensitive. Relapse is nothing shameful, all recoveries have their ups and downs, but there can be a high amount of (unintentional) humiliation for those who do relapse in NA or AA. Additionally, many may feel too uncomfortable to \u201csubmit to a higher power\u201d which is one of the first steps, and I have seen that be a barrier for many when they would otherwise be perfectly fine with the rest. There's a lot of pressure in NA and AA too, with the public awarding of week/month/year chips, and if a video like this sets her off, she may feel even worse in that kind of setting. NA and AA can be helpful for some, but this may not be the best resource for her. Other groups or therapy-based counseling may be helpful if she's not in counseling already.\n\nAnyway.

Also, let her know you're still proud of her continued journey. Love and blessings to your whole unit \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c", "That was very thoughtful of you. NTA", ">She made a huge change a year ago\n\nThat she is sticking to. She didn't treat this as a \"New Years Resolution\" sort of deal where the Resolution is over and forgotten about as soon as you have one moment of weakness. NO, she had a moment of weakness, and instead of giving up, she picked herself up and kept on going with her goal of beating her addiction.\n\nOP, you are NTA, when you have an addiction some of the hardest steps are the first ones, step 1, admitting you have a problem, step 2, asking for help, step 3, staring to get clean. Your mum has done those hard steps and they should be celebrated. Tell her you weren't celebrating her \"12months\" you were celebrating the day she made the decision to make a huge change in her life.", "Amazingly a situation where something couldn't have been put on social media because it didn't existed isn't comparable to a situation where there are countless examples of people filming private things just to post it to social media!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso amazingly, opening Christmas presents is very different from filming someone getting a personal message about their sobriety in front of a crowd!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe're learning all kinds of things here tonight!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAside: I think op is an asshole for this specific situation, but not an overall asshole. Intent behind the action is less important than harm caused by the action. OP, just apologize to your mom and explain you understand recovery can have its own time and process. There's a ton of pressure to keep up your \"streak\".", "Her dad knew about the relapse. It\u2019s understandable she wouldn\u2019t want to tell her child but would share with her partner."]}
