About a year or so ago, an intense situation occurred where she finally put down the bottle and said \u201cno more\u201d I even told her to her face I didn\u2019t believe her when she said this was the last straw (you just have to know to understand my harshness) but here she is proving me ALL the way wrong. I am truly at a loss for words at how incredible the whole thing is, and I beam with pride at this new person I see in front of me. This is an entire lifetime coming. \n\nFast forward to end of July and I know this month (Aug)will be her one year mark. So I was thinking of doing something really cool for her. I came across the Cameo website and decided this would be the way to go after searching the site and previewing a couple. I got a customized video from Dave Mustaine (she is a HUGE Megadeth fan) congratulating her on her sobriety and telling her to keep it up, that her family loves and supports her, etc etc. The video was actually really nice and worth the money I paid for it, and I was excited to show it to her. \n\nYesterday, as she was getting off of work I set the family TV up in the living room with the video set up so I could sit her down and play it, instead of having her watch on a phone. Also, I wanted to use my phone to record her reaction. I got everything set up, and after she got settled in from work I sat her down on the couch and told her I had something for her. I played the video. She originally smiled upon seeing Dave but as soon as he began to speak about her sobriety and the congrats and like, her face fell and she began to cry. I was confused at first and thought they were happy tears, but she got up and left the living room without saying a word and that\u2019s when I knew something was wrong. \n\nShe ran into her bedroom (which she shares with my father) and didn\u2019t come out for a long while. I was still confused so I left her alone for the time being. Only after my dad came out and I asked him what happened earlier, did he sit me down and tell me that my mom had actually relapsed at around month 7 (only once-has been sober since) and that she\u2019s been harboring feelings of shame and guilt about it..so my \u201cgift\u201d sent her over the edge. \n\nMy dad began to berate me, saying I should have never gotten her a gift and that I was essentially making everything worse by making a big deal about one of her milestones, especially in such a grandiose way. And that you don\u2019t ever know what people are going through so this was wrong of me, and could essentially trigger her into relapsing knowing how sensitive my mom is to the topic. This truly wasn\u2019t my intention, but now I\u2019m feeling extremely guilty and worried for my mom. I probably should have checked in with my dad before hand, but was it wrong of me to try and celebrate something I thought was important? Or am I just a dumb ass and this is truly something you shouldn\u2019t do?My mom has been distant with me since.", "created_utc": 1692111476, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15rv2au/aita_for_making_my_mother_cry_with_the_tactless/", "score": 330, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Please let Mom know that you did not know about the momentary relapse and you are still proud of her success. Hopefully she will eventually see the joy and pride that went it to choosing such an awesome gift.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThere's absolutely nothing wrong with your intentions. You were proud of you mom and her accomplishments, and you wanted to give her something unique to celebrate them. You didn't know what was going on, and that's not your fault. \n\nWhat you can do is: you can apologise to your mom for not checking with your dad beforehand, and next time, you'll know that 1) she would prefer if these milestones go by without celebrations, as she feels pressured, and; 2) that you should always ask your dad before taking decisions like this\n\nstill, you weren't in the wrong at all, and I find it unfair of your father to put the blame on you like this", "NTA relapse is part of recovery. It still marks a year that she seriously began on her path to recovery.", "How were you supposed to know about her relapse?  It\u2019s very easy for people to relapse without anyone else knowing.\n\nNTA", "No, NTA, you had good intentions and nobody told you she fell off the wagon", "how the hell were you supposed to know she relapsed? you did a sweet thing, and your father berating you is way undeserved. you had no way of knowing this would trigger her guilt over her relapse. NTA", "NTA, this is based on some of the other comments I read but I think it would be really great to sit your mum down and tell her you are proud of her for trying, 7 months from nothing is no joke and really inspiring. Relapse is part of the path to sobriety and you will hold onto the video for now and regift it once she reaches her 1y. Because she has shown the strength to get there and you believe she will - when she does you will be there to celebrate with her. If she tries again and relapses again she should forgive herself and never give up trying.", "NTA. You didnt know and your intention was to celebrate a positive thing. I would agree with your hindsight and talk to your dad/her about it in the future.", "NTA. The thought and intention were lovely and there's no way you could have known - she probably wouldn't have known how she would react if you'd asked her before either. Sometimes we can be taken by surprise by our own feelings. I'm sure once she has a chance to think it through she'll feel differently.", "NTA. Your father had no right to berate you and try to make you feel guilty. Perhaps your mom has been distant because she feels ashamed, but I'm sure she'll come around. Absolutely NTA though.", "NTA - she's sad because the relapsed and that's embarrassing, not because of your gift. Tell her to try again and you can play the video again for her on her new 1yr anniversary.", "NTA. As far as I know, people in sobriety *generally* appreciate the support, encouragement, and celebration from their loved ones. It's effing hard work to maintain your sobriety. How could you have known she had a disruption that would change her perception of this? Unfortunately, I guess this doesn't really mark a one-year anniversary after all (presumably the clock starts ticking anew from the relapse date?), but if that hadn't been shared with you, you were simply operating under the information you had. \n\nI will say this whole 'film everything!' vibe from social media is a tad annoying. IDK if that played a role here but it does seem like you put your mom on the spot and created a spectacle that she might not have been comfortable with, and that exacerbated her response. This is a 'know your audience' kind of thing though. But given the sensitivity of the subject, delivering the gift in private, letting her receive it without being filmed, etc. probably would have been better. Still, doesn't make you T A.", "NTA. It was hard for her to share her relapse, but you had good intentions with your gift. I don't think your gift was \"tactless,\" but more inspiring. She sounds quite fragile, but maybe in time, and with family encouragement, she will see the video for what it is: the love and pride of a daughter for her mother.", "NAH\n\nWell maybe your dad. \n\nYou didn\u2019t know she relapsed. You know your mom, does she like this kind of thing? Does she respond to positive feedback? If she hadn\u2019t relapsed do you expect she would have loved the cameo? \n\nI think wanting to show your mom how proud you are of her progress isn\u2019t bad. Your heart was in the right place. \n\nI think your mom\u2019s reaction is natural. I think she needs empathy and support to feel like she can try sobriety again.", "NTA.  Intention is everything here. You didn\u2019t know, and you meant well.", "NTA.  Having lived with several alcoholics (one of which I was briefly married to) in the past, I totally understand where you are coming from and I can almost feel how excited you were to acknowledge and celebrate this milestone with her.  It is her own guilt/shortcomings that have resulted in the tension here.  What you did was sincere and genuine and came from a place of love.  It's understandable that she feels guilt for the relapse.  It would be worse if she didn't.  But you are NOT the bad guy here.  Hopefully she comes out of her shame soon and the 2 of you can discuss and remedy.  Hang in there.  Dealing with alcoholics is hard but if she stays the course, the 2 of you will get through this in tact.  Good Luck.", "NTA, recovery is a hard process and many people relapse or have hiccups, especially in the first year. Your mother made the decision a year ago and besides it being a bumpy road she is staying on it. I am worried about some of your family dynamics, your mother should not be shunned for her relapse, especially since she has been sober since, but she should not be coddled either. I believe your father is an enabler and even though he believes that his actions are based in love, they are detrimental to her continued sobriety. I hope she is not doing this alone and has been seeing professional help or AA. Your father needs to look into some kind of help too, being a loved one of an addict is not an easy road either.", "Gentle YTA for talking about her journey without checking if would be appreciated and for wanting her reaction to be public so you could film it.\n\nPutting her relapse aside for a minute, people should generally be allowed to disclose their sobriety journey at their own time to the people they choose. There will be situations where they absolutely need to disclose certain information but outside of those the specifics and details should be their choice to share. \n\nYour mom is a fan of this person. She admires him. It may seem silly but knowing that he knows this about her might have been enough for this to be uncomfortable.\n\nHer relapse makes any emotions about this even more complicated- she\u2019s receiving accolades for something she didn\u2019t earn, she\u2019s let herself and her family down, and now she\u2019s lying and letting down her favorite artist.\n\nYou tried to do a good thing. You aren\u2019t to blame for her relapse or any relapse she may have in the future. \n\nI hope the message you convey to your mother that even with the relapse you can see she\u2019s actively trying to be better and to make better choices and that all that work and effort is making a positive difference for you, her, and your relationship. That\u2019s the most you can do for her, and even that is a gift - the rest is up to her and is her responsibility, not yours.\n\nTalk to your dad next time before bringing up her sobriety, even positively. And while it\u2019s a complete aside and probably a personal preference, please think twice before making something a spectacle for social media.", "NTA, but you are tactless. You shoudl have just had a video made of Dave sending her bday wishes. Steer well clear of sobriety and addiction discussions unless the person in recovery brings it up.", "NAH. You did not know. It was just a case of miscommunication. It is good you wanted to Support her. \n\nNext time, i think however you should consult with your dad before giving a gift about something that touches on such a loaded topic. \n\nCan you get mustaine to record an apology ? ;)\n\nEdit: also, please leave social media out of it and do not make it such a huge Event. This just Puts a lot of pressure on your mum and can backfire (like it did)", "NTA, your intentions were good. The thing to learn about drunks is that they wield their sobriety like a weapon and everything has to be on their terms or it will be \"your fault\" when they relapse.", "NTA, but now you know. I would talk with her. I would tell her that you were so proud of her and that's why you gave her a gift. I think it's also important to say that you're *still* proud of her. She relapsed once and didnt use it as an excuse to give up. That's commitment. \n\nTell her that you'd love to celebrate her successes with her, but won't plan any more surprises.", "I'm so sorry that you're going through this. Definitely NTA. You didn't know about the relapse. If anything, you were trying to show her that you're proud of her and you were just being supportive and loving. I don't think it was necessary for your dad to berate you like he did. He could've been a little more understanding about your intentions while also explaining that moving forward, there's no cause for celebration unless your mom wants to personally acknowledge any milestones on her sobriety journey. Give your mom all the space she needs to come around. I hope that she does and realizes that your gift wasn't malicious or meant to make her feel bad.", "YTA strictly for this part:\n\n> Also, I wanted to use my phone to record her reaction.\n\nSuddenly the gift isn't about celebrating her milestone, but about you having video you can do what with, exactly?  Post for Internet updoots?\n\nI mean, the Mustaine cameo was a good idea, and it's not your fault addicts lie about relapsing, but maybe learn how to experience important moments while they're happening, not through a camera, and maybe learn that not all important moments are for trying to get meaningless 'likes' from Internet strangers.", "Soft YTA. I just don\u2019t think personal things like sobriety should be made into, like you said in your post, a grandiose gesture. Tactless indeed, but your intentions were good.", "Former alcoholic here, recovery is hard. You don\u2019t know what your mom is going through. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t want a spectacle to be made while I\u2019m on the road to bettering myself. It\u2019s a long, difficult journey. YTA, but your heart was in the right place. Just don\u2019t do it again.", "Yta. For everyone saying \u201chow could she have known\u201d that isn\u2019t really the point. Things like this should not be made into a huge event that\u2019s recorded for social media.", "Soft YTA. Addiction is right up there on the list of the most personal, private things that a person can struggle with, and relapses are common. There's a reason it's Alcoholics ANONYMOUS. You had good intentions but this was an incredibly tone deaf thing to do. Next time just TALK to her, don't set her up - on camera no less - for a big grandiose thing that she may not appreciate or feel is appropriate.", "YT(well-intetioned) Asshole. One of the core ways we help the alcoholics in our lives is by not offering any help or even encouragement that isn't explicitly asked for. And allowing that most of the help an alcoholic is likely to ask for will be from other alcoholics. I can only imagine how shitty it would feel to hear one of your heroes invited into your personal failings. You meant well, but you really hurt her.", "YTA. I mean you didn't do it on purpose but like the old saying, \" the road to hell is paved with good intentions\". Not everyone wants a big deal made of their sobriety, or to talk about it even. Should have just left it with birthday wishes.", "NTA. If no one told you, how were you supposed to know? \n\nWhat you did was very thoughtful and sweet in support of your mom. I understand that she may have been ashamed of her relapse, but you were not made aware of it. I don't understand the reaction from your father, he was a bit harsh...", "Very soft YTA, even though your intentions were good. \n\nEven if she hadn't had a relapse, I don't think telling other people about her (supposedly past) alcoholism was the right move, or all the filming her reaction, etc. Her journey isn't a social media spectacle (and even if you weren't going to make any of the filming public, telling one person, who she was a big fan of, was one person too many.)\n\n**All that being said** one thing being left out of the comments is how hard this whole thing must have been for you. Growing up as a child with an alcoholic parent is terrible. And you deserve compassion for it. I hope you're doing okay.", "NTA.\n\nYou meant well and she should toughen the fuck up. If she relapsed she should take this as a goal to get to.\n\nSupport her in everything you can, but tell her that your gift WILL make sense when she gets to the time period that was mentioned.", "Isn't it kinda a thing with recovering addicts that they're supposed to be honest about how long they've *actually* been sober with their families/support systems? That you didn't know she's only 5 months sober seems like a symptom of a her problem. NTA. \n\nThat was a pretty great gift and, honestly, unpopular opinion here, but 1 drink or episode of drinking in 12 months sounds like recovery to me, I know we have impossible standards for addicts in society where they're never allowed to partake again or they're total failures, but she's gone from probably daily drinking to once in a year - that's a turn around she should be proud of.\n\nEdit: typo", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I've been blamed for relapses.  You mom is an addict, this will be a lifelong struggle.  You genuinely tried to do something nice - if your mom had been honest with you about her journey, it would have been fine.  Try talking to your mom, asking her how you can support her best on her terms.  Keep the door open for her to feel more comfortable opening up to you about her struggles (we call them the white-knuckle-moments) and how her sobriety journey is REALLY going.  It's been a tough lesson for me to learn, to meet the addict on their terms (not mine); to set aside hurt feelings and anger and my own disappointment.  No one is as upset at the addict themselves.  It's SO HARD to listen to tales of drinking, of choosing \"just one glass of wine\" that leads to a 3 day bender, and NOT JUDGE - just offer support.  But you can do it.

They aren\u2019t bad necessarily, but have problems interacting with the world and people in a healthy way\n\nSo even when they are sober,  it can be really hard for them.  They need love and support, but we also have to acknowledge that they can be manipulative.  And a manipulative person will find an excuse to twist people.", "Four days ago she was calling them \"alkies\", so I don't think her hateful rhetoric is going to change, unfortunately.\n\nAs someone struggling with alcoholism myself, it's comments like hers that make it harder to deal with!", "You have a PhD in addiction and you use derogatory terms like 'drunks'?", "In another comment she says \"alkie\", so that PhD came with a rich and varied lexicon for alcohol addiction.", "I'm a drunk. A recovering drunk but a drunk nonetheless. Calling it something pretty doesn't change the fact", "NTA Replases are part of recovery. Your mom shouldn't be ashamed. She still deserves to be celebrated for the effort she has put in. \n\nTell her congratulations from me too.", "NTA, your dad is the fucking asshole though for sure and he needs some therapy.", "NTA. It was a beautiful gift, as far as you knew. \n\nAlso, it's good that she feels ashamed. It shows that she's trying and wants to succeed. Not all shame is bad.", "NTA screw your mom and dad! This was a thoughtful gift. They decided to keep lying and stay in the cycle of addiction. So those emotions they feel now. They have to own them. \nI'm really sorry OP that you got your hopes up by your mom.", "You should apologize to yourself for having expectations and feeling proud of your mother as it was a waste of mental and emotional energy. You're the one who should be distant, not the other way around. - NTA", "NTA.\n\nPart of the program is to take accountability for your mistakes. It includes important information from you \n\nIt's not a tactless gift. It's a heart felt and a very thoughtful one. \n\nYou had no way to know. It's not your fault. Your father is blaming the wrong person.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't know and your gift came from a place of good intentions.\n\nYou need to talk to her and explain and tell her you're sorry you did something that upset her and you really didn't intend for that to happen.", "NTA, it doesn't matter that she relapsed once, but it does matter that she lied about it. If she cannot be honest with you, how are you supposed to be there for her?", "NTA at all. What you did was very touching and you had absolutely no reason to assume otherwise. This could have been avoided by your mother acknowledging her relapse rather than keeping it a secret. But it is also understandable if she felt ashamed and chose to keep it to herself. Thus, it would have been appropriate for her to make clear that she didn't want any kind of celebration for her sobriety for... whatever reason.\n\nI relapsed 3 years into my sobriety journey. It was a brief relapse that I chose to keep secret, as I didn't want to burden my family with that information. I recently hit 10 years (as far as everyone knows) and I allow my family to congratulate me each year, in whatever way they see fit, without it triggering a relapse because it was my decision to keep that information from them and to accept the fact that they will believe that I never relapsed...which was literally the whole point of not telling them! I can understand why this may be distressing for your mother, but you are in no way the AH for that.", "YTA for sharing this personal information with people who have nothing to do with it. You should have checked this with your father first.\n\nSorry for being harsh but the bit where you just go share such personal information with strangers (this individual might be a celebrity but is a stranger nonetheless) makes it hard for me to say N T A.\n \nLook, you meant well, but there's a saying: *the road to hell is paved with good intentions*.", "I mean, you know your mum better than we do. As a struggling alcoholic myself, I would have personally hated having a big spectacle made of my recovery, particularly if you were filming it. It's an intensely personal thing for me, and I'd feel awkward having it highlighted. If anything, I'd prefer a hug and a card saying how proud you were of me, rather than a whole cinematic experience, but that may just be me!\n\nI empathise with how much your mother's drinking will have affected you in life, and how proud you are of her, but I'm afraid you may have overstepped slightly here. I'd say slight YTA, but I want to emphasise that you would absolutely not be at fault if she relapses.", "NTA.\n\nI'm so sorry you're dealing with this. I see some Y-T-A's in the comments, and while I understand what they're saying, I also think that it's completely unfair. You've spent 20+ years living with an alcoholic, which you in no way deserved, and I'm sure had many MANY difficult moments at her hands due to her drinking.\n\nYou saw your mother getting healthy, and coming to a place where she can be a more present and positive and consistent part in your life without having to deal with the baggage of her drinking. You wanted to celebrate her, and probably celebrate how excited you are that you'll get to experience this new life with her.\n\nIt is NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to read up on how to treat an addict. It is not your mental load to carry. You've already had too much to carry with having one alcoholic parent and one parent who could not protect you from the effects of her drinking. Your gift was not tactless. Your parents should have told you how to best support her. Your parents should have told you that she relapsed if they didn't want you to have a false idea of the length of her sobriety.\n\nI don't think alcoholism is a moral failing. I also don't think that alcoholism absolves you of the responsibility to communicate with the people you love to ensure they don't inadvertently hurt you.", "NTA. The sentiment was right, the number of months was just slightly off. I might even consider getting her another less specific cameo from him saying she\u2019s still doing awesome and to keep it up. 7 months is still really great. \nI don\u2019t blame  your dad for getting upset because it\u2019s hard not to get emotional in these situations, but in the light of day it should be obvious your heart was on the right place. He has gone through a lot as the partner of an addict as have you as the child of one.", "Relapse or not this year has been transformative which is why you marked it: and \u2018I beam with pride at this new person I see in front of me. This is an entire lifetime coming.\u2019\nPlease tell her and your dad this part. \nYou are such a dear.", "NTA. I'm so sorry. Your gift was not tactless and your dad had no right to react that way. \n\nYou couldn't have known because she didn't tell you. What if she was celebrating her 1 year sober milestone and you did nothing? That would suck right? So you did a sweet, loving thing and it caused her to feel guilty and your dad pretty helpless.\n\nHave you been to any meetings for family members of addicts? It may be helpful for you to go and get support. Or even a personal therapist if group therapy is not your thing.", "NTA, it was literally her own guilt and own actions that caused her breakdown. You have her something very thoughtful and nice, she\u2019s the one who ruined it. \n\nAlso she\u2019s literally still made so much progress. And one slip up doesn\u2019t take away from all her her progress on the mountain she\u2019s climbing. I would emphasize that the one slip up is nothing in the grand scheme of things and that you are still very proud of how far she\u2019s come.", "NTA, and truthfully? It\u2019s still worth congratulating her and celebrating the one year mark of her committing to getting sober. So she relapsed. So what! She\u2019s sober now and has been since, right? That\u2019s still worth celebrating!\n\nProgress isn\u2019t linear, and you can still congratulate her and be proud of her for still choosing to stay sober. Maybe find a way to tell her that. It is not on you to help her forgive herself, but knowing the people she loves are proud of her regardless of the slip might make it a little easier to.\n\nLet this be a bridge, not a roadblock.", "NAH except for your dad.  But maybe try to talk it out with her.  She still deserves to be proud of herself and know that you're proud of her.  Emotions surrounding this stuff are intense and hard.", "Tell her to try again and you can play the video again for her on her new 1yr anniversary.", "Dave Mustaine is TA in general tho", "Yup, OP can\u2019t be blamed for what she didn\u2019t know, and her dad is being unreasonable. Dad should have at least acknowledged OP\u2019s effort.\n\nOP: NTA. You did nothing wrong.", " If she relapsed she should take this as a goal to get to.", "[removed]", "I'm really sorry OP that you got your hopes up by your mom.", "Just because she relapsed doesn't mean OP shouldn't be proud of her. My dad was an alcoholic for his whole life and never put in the kind of effort OP's mom has put in to change. If he had I sure as hell would have been proud.", "Drunks = everyone in recovery? They *all* wield it like that?", "I'm sure supportive comments like yours work magic to improve an already tragic situation. Also curious to know: Where did you earn your PhD? I imagine it's quite the program.", "Do we know that OP was recording it for social media? I had just assumed she was filming it because it was a gift she put a lot of thought into and wanted to capture her mother's joy in receiving it.\n\nMaybe I'm biased because I take loads of videos and rarely do I post anything on social media, but that was not my take on the post at all.", "Parents of the 20th century will be shocked to learn that they all recorded their kids opening gifts every Christmas morning for social media clout. \n\nMostly because they wouldn't understand the words your speaking. Almost like people have been doing things a lot longer than you've been around.", "Does OP say anywhere that the video was for social media? I had just assumed it was for personal use/enjoyment and to remember this milestone.", "You did a beautiful thing.  Don't let your dad being shitty about it convince you otherwise.\n\nYou wanted to celebrate her.  How were you to know that she had relapsed or that this would make her feel worse?  \n\nYou didn't ask for advice.  But if I were you, I would go to my mother and tell her, \"A year ago, you started a journey.  It isn't an easy one, and I doubted you then.  What's happened in the time since has been incredible.  Seeing you transform into someone that is so much happier has made me so proud of the person you are and are becoming, and I wanted to show you that.  You had a drink a few months ago, and I don't want to minimize that for you, BUT that doesn't undo your decision a year ago.  I love you and I'm proud of you.\" \n\nOr something like that.  \n\nReally depends on your relationship with her, though, because I totally get why you doubted her a year ago in the first place.  Don't reach out if that way lies only pain.", "NTA you were proud of her and the fight she was winning. you wanted to celebrate a milestone and I was under the impression that was ok in these situations. the problem was she hadn't nade it that far. \n\ntell your mother you hadn't known about the slip.\n\ntell your mother you've seen the change in her and how happy it makes you.\n\ntell her you love her and anything else.and through it all, NTA. but she's on a tough road.", "OP, this is exactly the plot of season 2 of the \"the Flight Attendant\" - I suggest you check out the clip where the protagonist finally confronts her lying to herself (and her AA sponsor) about her sober date. As an adult child of an addict, you will understand this clip in your soul and it may help you understand your mothers reaction a bit better - tho you don't own her lying you can see how it's sensitive to her.", "Very much so. Huge fan of his art though", "No, that's an assumption on my part.  But lets be honest, it's probably for social media.", "This is the perfect suggestion. Everyone makes mistakes when trying to kick old habits--addiction or otherwise--and emphasizing how proud you are of her for sticking with it even when things got rocky and after messing up is a golden way to show her how proud you are of what she's doing and how much you support the change that she is going for.", "Lying about a relapse is not a good sign for the recovering addict or their family. The addict learns that bending the rules is fine and that is a slippery slope. The family get a false sense of security that relapses don't happen if people are really recovering (of course they do, it's getting back on track that matters).\n\nDad is doing no-one any favours by blaming a relapse on anyone other than the recovering addict, he needs a wake-up call more than anyone else here. NTA", "Yeah, it's become really commonplace somehow, but it pressures the person being recorded to perform during a emotional moment for them. I feel old for finding it repulsive, but I do. \n\nStill, it's so common that I can't really blame OP for thinking it was a normal thing to do.  It kind of is, even if I don't like it.", "Isn\u2019t recording people\u2019s reactions to things to be for them to look at later? Why is that gross?", "Exactly. I lost two good friends to drug overdoses, both which probably could have been prevented if they hadn't felt too ashamed to get help. Comments like the one above remind me why.", "I imagine being raised by two alcoholics has caused quite a bit of pain. I also imagine one the hardest parts of recovery for an addict must be acknowledging the pain they caused. I am not defending the rehtoric or the deragatory words just aknowledging that the anger behind the words likely come from their pain from a very real lived experience with addicts.", "I mean, if you're going to base your judgement on something it probably shouldn't be your own assumption.", "PLEASE explain this to your father. He probably won't respond well in the moment but he needs to hear it.", "I get what you\u2019re saying but this black-and-white thinking doesn\u2019t help realistically. If an addict relapses and equates that with total failure, they\u2019re unlikely to try to recover again. That\u2019s not saying it\u2019s no big deal if it happens: it\u2019s saying it\u2019s not the end-all. The fact that the relapse happened and she still went back to recovery after that *should* be celebrated."]}
