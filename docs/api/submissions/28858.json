It just so happened that one of the people attending was an old neighbour from my hometown (19m) that we will call Aaron.\n\nHe sat next to me and since I knew him I decided to say hi. He acted like he didn't know me (which is odd because Ihave very distinct features) but we still chatted a bit.\n\nHe instantly started sending me countless memes, something I found weird because even when we were younger he didn't like me because his grandma had tried to sue me along with other kids for false noise complaints.\n\nIt only got worse from there. The moment I got home he started pestering me and constantly telling me to hang out (just the two of us). I wasn't sure what to answer to him because honestly I wasn't that eager to hang out with him and I had prior plans. And since I was on my home I decided to answer to his messages later.\n\nThis only made him annoy me more and he started getting more and more demanding. I was, truthfully, very annoyed by his certainty that I would hang out with just him, when we didn't even talk to each other for two consecutive hours. So I told him that I will tell him next week whether we can go out or not.\n\nThroughout the lectures he would show me unfunny memes and try to convince me he has \"w rizz\" (yes he actually said w rizz) while I tried to pay attention. His justification about his \"rizz\" was that if he asked a girl something like \"date when\" she would accept to go on a date with him.\n\nAaron also pestered me to give him my phone number and for two days straight he would always call me with every chance he got. After the first two phone calls I stopped answering because in two days he had calle 7 times with absolutely no reason.\n\nHe would also indirectly chase out anyone else I was talking to because he was stuck to me like glue and if I wanted to ask a professor something he would instantly make up a question only to follow me to the professor's desk.\n\nHe would always text me \"don't ignore me pussy\" or\"answer n word\" (neither of us is black), and in three instances he called me fat (even though I weigh about 120 pounds which I think is normal for my height) and I felt angry and disrespected because I didn't give him any right to talk to me like this.\n\nNow he is still texting me and asking me to go to uni with him and I obviously decline.

He's trying to neg you into liking him. It's gross and manipulative. He's also violating your space.\n\nWhen you do confront him, be careful, there's too many stories about these things getting violent.

So I suggest you let him know, and fairly specifically, that his rude texts, incessant contact and insults aren\u2019t friendly or funny, they feel like harassment. And that you aren\u2019t comfortable around him after all that, even/especially because you didn\u2019t have any real close relationship growing up. Tell him he needs to work on making new friends and you suggest he try a different approach. Some guys are stupid enough to think this works to win over a girl. And then block his number. I\u2019d try to have your dad or a friend or someone you trust present when you confront him. I bet the professor or TA would be willing to back you up if needed.\n\nYou are NTA here.

He's not going to have any idea of how other people view this behaviour until it bows up in his face a few dozen times. \nDrop a truth bomb on him and tell him exactly what he's putting it into the world. \nIt's immature, not cool.

Listen, you are young and might not have learned yet that you do not have to entertain harassment by men/boys for any reason.

It sucks that you have to baby his immature ego but safety first. 1. You don't have to give your number to anyone. EVER.  2. Anyone who calls you names doesn't deserve a second of your consideration.
