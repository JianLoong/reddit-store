My partner and my father have been to a few of these games alone before, but since my father is so family oriented and loves doing things as a family, we surprised him with tickets to a game we could all attend together.\n\nBefore buying these tickets, we consulted my sibling (19 NB) and mother (61F) on whether they would be interested/willing to go. They both responded enthusiastically, so my partner and I bought all of us tickets. My dad was delighted at his gift, and we all said that we were very excited for it.\n\nThe actual game was this last weekend. We met at my parents' house for lunch, after which we went to the stadium to our seats. These were really good seats, in the shade, very close to the front, and in the middle of the sideline. My partner and I sponsored snacks and drinks for everyone, as this was our treat.  We went to the stadium about an hour and a half before the game started to avoid large crowds. My sibling had two beers (we live in South Africa, drinking age is 18), a bottle of Coke, a packet of chips and an ice cream. These were, of course, purchased at stadium prices that had been pushed all the way up.\n\nAbout 15 minutes into the first 40 minutes of the game, my sibling started rocking back and forth while covering their ears. They said that they were overwhelmed by the amount of people and all the screaming. This was accompanied with a pointed look at me, as I had been cheering loudly along with many other spectators. They eventually brought their knees up to their chest and started hyperventilating. This prompted my mother - who had been enjoying the game thus far - to inform us that she would leave the stadium with my sibling, and that they would wait for us at a nearby mall, leaving just three of us. I could see my dad was very disappointed, but he didn't say anything about it.\n\nSo, for some context: my sibling has said that they are autistic, but has never been professionally diagnosed. They have been to several psychologists, and have had tests done several times, but has never been diagnosed with autism. Furthermore, my sibling goes out most weekends to clubs - which are notoriously overwhelming and noisy and packed. Not only that, my sibling has been to the exact stadium to watch the exact teams that were playing, just with one of their friends instead of their family (this was about 3 years ago, though).\n\nI told my mother that my partner and I were peeved at my sibling for flaking on my dad's present when they enthusiastically agreed to it and have been and continue to put themselves in similar situations. She called me an AH for not supporting my sibling's neurodivergency and not being sympathetic.\n\nSo, AITA? I always try to be the best ally I can be and I would appreciate being called out if I am in the wrong.\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who commented. \nI now realise that I was viewing this issue through a neurotypical lense and only seeing the inconsistencies. As some neurodivergent commenters brought to my attention, the same situations will be fine some times and be totally overstimulating at other times. And the noise in places like a club will be totally different from a stadium.\nFurthermore, it is also not my place to comment on whether my sibling is neurodivergent or not. I recognise that getting a diagnosis for any type of neurodivergency is difficult, and an inaccurate diagnosis is more damaging than anything else.\nI have already communicated with my sibling that I don't expect them to join events like this again, but that they would be welcome to, should they want to. If we do attend an event like this together again, I will be sure to talk through what accomodations must be made or which steps can be taken to ensure that everyone is having a pleasant time.\n\nThank you again to everyone who raised points I might not have thought of!", "created_utc": 1678187364, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11kwec1/aita_for_not_supporting_neurodivergency/", "score": 167, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Are they tired from just being in a crowded space?", "Gonna say NTA here - if they have these issues they could have come better prepared; ear mufflers something to fidget/distract with etc", "NTA \n\nThe picture you paint does indeed make it seem like they're faking.\n\nIf we for one second entertain the possibility that they weren't though. \n\nWhy would they come to a stadium which by definition is going to be loud and crowded? \n\nLet's say they didn't consider it or decided to suck up for the sake of \"nice family thing\". Why wouldn't they bring ear plugs or noise cancelling headphones or literally anything that would make the loud noises more manageable?\n\nBased on the fact that they go to clubs it's quite obvious that neither loud noises or crowds affect them very much if at all in the same way it would someone who's actually neurodivergent.\n\nI say this as guy with ADD who has a partner with Autism. Since autism presents differently between different people, I can add that I have several friends with autism as well as a cousin who also has it. \n\nYour sibling however is not autistic. Do not entertain it.", "Even if your sibling doesnt have autism, have they ever been tested for sensory processing disorder?", "NAH. I can understand your frustration, but you're not in a position to definitely say if your sibling is autistic or not, so you should really have a seat on your judgement there.\n\nI don't think your sibling did anything wrong, because overstim can be super unpredictable, even if you plan ahead.", "NTA. \n\nThey are not not diagnosed with autism even though they pursued a diagnosis but still claim to have it.

Which would totally be fine if they had proceeded to leave on their own. They could have went to the bathroom to try and ground themselves or leave to the nearby mall on their own - 19 is not a child anymore. Instead they made your mother, who enjoyed the match with her husband and family, leave with them without even asking if she\u2019d be fine with accompanying them. That\u2019s what makes them the AH.\n\nYes, your comment can be seen as unnecessary, but you didn\u2019t say it directly to your sibling and you only said the truth.\n\nI\u2019m sorry the day wasn\u2019t like you all imagined it would be.", "NTA. I feel like most people saying YTA are woke people with this false idea that you have to agree with everything someone does and says to be supportive, and I have to call BS. I am neurodivergent, and my diagnosis along with everyone who has one does not mean that we don't lie or manipulate. It could be that her sibling does have a real issue that happens under certain conditions, but it could also be that the sibling was lying because they became bored and wanted a blame-free reason to leave. BOTH are possible, and I have seen BOTH. It doesn't make OP a bad person or an A-hole because she questioned behavior that was inconsistent.", "Just FYI, per University of Washington\u2019s guidelines, it\u2019s very common to self diagnose autism. There\u2019s very little resources for young adults seeking an official diagnosis. Especially as a woman, there are still no diagnostic criteria for women with autism. And an official diagnosis from a healthcare provider really doesn\u2019t do much and can be mentally, physically and financially exhausting. \n\nJust as an example how every situation is different for autistics. I LOVE sports games and concerts (but I bring ear plugs). But I HATE grocery stores and malls and they send me into sensory overload. It\u2019s odd, but it\u2019s just how I am. \n\nThat being said, I still think NTA. As someone with autism, I research events to know what to expect and always bring ear plugs. If I know I don\u2019t like something or won\u2019t enjoy something, I agree not to go to ensure I wouldn\u2019t affect how other people enjoy the event. \n\nPart of an autism dx (whether official or self diagnosed) isn\u2019t just about a label or earning recognition for having it. It\u2019s important for autistics to learn about themselves and why they do things the way they do. This was a LOT of work, but it\u2019s ultimately one of the only things that helped me be successful in my young adult life. Without putting the time and effort in, life is difficult.", "INFO: Why is OP an A-H for feeling annoyed? Op told their mother, not their Sibling. Nowhere does OP state they berated or called out their Sibling in any way.  Are people not entitled to their own feelings anymore?", "I\u2019m going with NAH. I have ADHD with sensory issues, particularly auditory sensitivity. Some situations overwhelm me more than others, and some situations I\u2019ve been fine with in the past can be unbearable if my barrier has been broken down by other experiences leading up to it.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m also logical about this and understand that my needing to bow out of a situation can be irritating to others. Especially if it\u2019s an event we\u2019ve gone to together.\n\nYour sibling is young and hasn\u2019t learned the tricks to avoid overwhelm that someone in their 40s (like myself) may have. I bring ear plugs with me (I\u2019m particularly fond of the Loop ones that allow you to hear conversation with close company but drown out ambient noise) to events, and I make sure that I\u2019m not leaving anyone in a lurch. As it was, your dad still had company and your mum was not bothered in keeping your sibling company as well. No harm, no foul.\n\nNothing wrong in being a little irritated with your sibling, and you didn\u2019t express those feelings with your sibling themself. All good.", "From the title, I was going to say duh y-t-a, but after reading I gotta go against the grain to NTA. The reason people self diagnosis is because they can't afford testing. Your sibling had been blessed enough to be able to afford that and has testing done several times and it came back that they aren't on the spectrum. There may be some other issue, or maybe after lock down  they find being in public hard, but I don't think you're an ass for looking at the evidence and suspecting your sibling. It wouldn't do any good to confront them, though, so there's that", "Soft ESH. Your sibling is 100% old enough to communicate to you that they are uncomfortable and your screaming is a trigger to them. They are also old enough to both not be put in that situation or bring stim toys and a headset in case. I AM neurodivergent in many ways, and it sounds more like your sibling has social anxiety than the nuances of autism, they're very similar in presentation with noises and stimulation issues, and if the psychologists don't think they're autistic that's likely the cause. You are TA because you think they're \"faking it\" and \"overreacting\" *mmh my favourite word*. Your mom is the MVP for taking your sibling out of the situation.", "YTA. Functioning is not linear, and just because someone can endure an overwhelming sensory situation one day does not mean that it won\u2019t affect them a different day. There are so many factors it play. \n\nThe exact same input can have a totally different effect on someone on any given day, and that doesn\u2019t mean they are faking it", "YTA\n\nGetting professionally diagnosed takes ages and autism is not always tested properly. Being from South Africa myself I know for a fact it's extremely difficult to get properly diagnosed for anything in this country. Most people only get an official diagnosis in their late 20's or early 30s. You don't know what your sibling is feeling or personally going through. I'm not diagnosed with Autism but I have been diagnosed with ADHD and PTSD and I get over stimulated and overwhelmed at times in public places and need to remove myself from said places. Yeah it sucks and your father was bummed out but unfortunately shit happens. He still got to enjoy the game and gift you presented. A person can not always know how they are going to feel until they are placed in the situation. Some days are easier to cope than others.  If your dad was upset he can speak for himself.", "YTA, even people without autism can have different reactions to similar circumstances depending. Diagnosis is very difficult to get because autism is a spectrum and especially difficult if you are not one of the cases that have issues all the time. Your sibling didn't demand that you or your mom go with them, your mom went on her own (because she cares for her child, how surprising) ... so trying to throw some shade by \"they spoiled our dad's present\" is painly rude. They obviously wanted to be there and enjoy the game with their family. Sensory overload is not something that you can control.", "I'm neurodivergant (ASC).\n\nI can go to a club with good music, the bass is comforting, the tunes familiar, and I can't hear loads of people. Plus everyone is smiling & hugging.\n\nOTOH, a packed venue with lots of people talking/screaming lound, especially outside, in a place I've not been to before, and I'd be a wreck.\n\nIt's all about context.\n\nEven if they where neurotypical but intensly uncomfortable by the situation, they'd have reasonable cause to leave.\n\nYTA.", "NTA. Your sibling doesn\u2019t have a diagnosis despite having been perfectly placed to receive one, therefore how could you support neurodivergency that you don\u2019t know exists, or in what form? A self-diagnosis is not the same as a legitimate one. \n\nYour sibling might very well be neurodivergent but not have autism. Only trained professionals are able to tell you that. \n\nSimilarly, at 19 your sibling is old enough to prepare for a situation they might find overstimulating by bringing ear plugs, and to spend some time by themselves so as to not ruin someone else\u2019s birthday gift. \n\nYou also have every right to say how something made you feel. I have (actual diagnosed) ADHD and sometimes certain of my behaviours have caused people to get upset/offended. That doesn\u2019t necessarily make them ableist - I just explain myself, and consider if an apology is necessary or if they need to get over it once I\u2019ve explained the context.\n\nAnd-significantly- you didn\u2019t raise this with your sibling. You raised it with your mother, who is not neurodivergent. She could have quite happily left to comfort the 19 year old, set them up somewhere quieter, and come back to be there for your dad.", "NTA.  Sounds to me like they were needing some attention. Particularly if 1. They have seen multiple professionals and have not been diagnosed and 2. They have no issue going to clubs on the weekends.   If They were truly autistic They cannot pick and choose when to be affected.", "NTA\n\nTo the people who say you can't know what a neurodivergent person is thinking or feeling, you're right, but guess what?  You also don't know what a nondisclosed mental state person (whom you might assume is neurotypical) is thinking or feeling either!  That puts everyone on a level playing field when it comes to expectations on behavior.\n\nAt age 19, a person should know that sporting events are loud and also whether or not they can handle it.  Agreeing to it and then creating a scene to get out of it is not cool.  If they just politely excused themselves and said to meet up somewhere after the game that would've been different.  The attention grabbing antics were unnecessary and therefore the sibling was the AH.", "YTA - first, getting a diagnosis can be extremely difficult, no matter how much testing you go through or how many psychologist you see. \n\nSecondly, sometimes you can be okay in a situation and then become extremely overwhelmed in the same situation later on.  You can also sometimes handle certain places while being unable to handle others. \n\nExample - I do fine at heavy metal concerts. I cannot handle being in a store on an extremely busy day with too many people. I use to be able to handle amusement parks just fine - I now cannot - unless they're hosting a special neurodivergent day. \n\nYou don't get to decide what someone else is feeling or what they should or shouldn't be able to handle.", "soft ESH. \n\nyes, your sibling could have been better prepared, but maybe they simply didn't know how overwhelming it would feel, considering sensory overload also has more factors to it than just the sensory experience itself (i.e. being streassed means you overload easier). \n\nI am not sure if your sibling does actually have autism, considering they have been to multiple psychologists about it and haven't been diagnosed (yes, I know, autism diagnosis in non cis male adults is harder) and they are non binary, which can be so socially isolating that you think you're autistic. I'm a trans man and that happened to me (if you wanna know more about how, look at my latest post) so maybe your sibling is experiencing the same issue.\n\nEither way, the stress they experienced from the situation was very real. It's okay to feel disappointed that they had to leave, but it probably wasn't fun for them either. Your mother reacted in a weird way, but she was probably just trying to support your sibling while they were having a tough time. It's an unfortunate situation where everyone felt bad afterwards.", "NTA, I would say you're the ah but if he/her really goes to clubs where it's literally packed with people and the music is so loud you have to scream to hear one another ....", "YTA\n\nGood Ally's support neurodivergence in whatever form it takes - not whatever form disturbs them the least and that they find the most palitable.\n\nYour sibling sounds like they were dealing with a case of sensory overload and having been there myself, it's miserable and often hard to adequately explain to neurotypicals.  Trust me when I tell you we hate it more than y'all do.", "YTA\n\n> I told my mother that my partner and I were peeved at my sibling for flaking on my dad's present\n\nWhy? What was your intent when dumping this on your mom?", "YTA for assuming they were faking. Why would they fake it? What would be the point? If they're so desperate for attention that they do need to fake being overwhelmed then there must be something wrong - it's not normal. They obviously needed to leave for some reason. Have a little sympathy.", "YTA Your sibling can't help his brain function. It's a shame you can't be more sympathetic to that. What are you going to do if you have a child like that? Push them to aside?", "&#x200B;\n\nyou didn't support him and it doesn't matter why he had to leave.  What if he had a stomach issue?  would you have forced them to stay?\n\nASD isn't the same all through life.  issues can get worse, change, and new ones can pop up.  \n\nalso, it can be the kind of noise not just how loud it is.\n\nYTA, but I also think others are not supporting him either.  Just saying someone has ASD isn't support.  they need to help him with finding interventions and accommodations so he can participate with the family fully.  I easiest is noise-canceling headphones.  they have ones for shows and clubs that let you hear at a lower db.\n\nalso in the future, most of these places have cheap hearing protection if you ask.  if they are nice they will just hand you some but they will likely charge you like 10 bucks for a .50 cent piece of foam.", "NTA. \n\nYour sibling is 19 years old and can take responsibility for their circumstances.\n\nThey could have expressed concerns when the event was originally discussed; they were enthusiastic about it.\n\nThey could have thought ahead and brought ear plugs or ear protection.

(I had great success with shooting guards for my young son at arena football games). \n\nMaybe a bit rude to characterize what happened as \u201cflaking\u201d, but I feel your sibling bears the lion\u2019s share of the responsibility here.", "YTA", "NTA you brother is an adult and should begin to act like one.", "NTA\n\nI think you handled things well and should merely not invite your sibling to any event like this ever again. If they can go clubbing every weekend, they can handle a sporting event without a meltdown.

Win in the other siblings column in their mind. \n\nLiterally hundreds of thousands of these situations have existed. This happens to families every day. \n\nAt some point, we have to stop using neurodivergence as an excuse for every single reaction. We all have to learn to cope with ourselves. At 19, an adult, it\u2019s no longer appropriate to make a scene when you\u2019re uncomfortable or unable to process the situation normally. I get that sometimes things are okay and sometimes they aren\u2019t. Sometimes, bars are totally okay for me. Other times, I can\u2019t be in the same room as three other people because of the noise.

In many ways I'd argue that a club would be a worse setting for someone who's neurodivergent than a stadium would be. \n\nAll of this as well as knowing several people with autism and their different approaches to similar environments lead me to conclude that they're likely faking it for whatever reason.", "My logic is simple. 15 - 20% of the population is neurodivergent. \n\nthis guy is 19 so 50% he uses tik tok, overprotective mother so 70% he uses tik tok, he was ok with night clubs but apparently stadium is just too loud so 80% he uses tik tok, considers himself as non binary so 99.9% he uses tik tok. \n\nAs far as we know he seeks attention.", "Yes", "Yes 100%. Internalized ableism is absolutely a thing. It\u2019s easy to get trapped thinking that you are less of a person if you are disabled, or not worthy of accommodation because society and people\u2019s views reinforce this every way you turn.", "Damn. I was diagnosed with autism when I was 8. I can't always wear earplugs, sometimes I do, sometimes the sensory feeling of earplugs is so bad, the overstimulation of the environment im in is still terrible but better than the headphones. Sometimes im okay in a party or club or stadium environment, sometimes im not. Sometimes im fine in a setting and then all of a sudden im on the verge of a meltdown. The grocery store is harder for me personally than a concert. Am I faking because I don't match the way you view autism? Do you also have autism? Do you have a medical degree in diagnosing autism? or you do you just know people with autism and think that gives you credibility to determine that someone is faking?", "Okay, but that's not me though.", "Okay so I'm gonna be honest. I did struggle reading your block of text a little bit, but I did it and I get the feeling you're a little bit upset about my comment. \n\nThat's understandable, I do have a tendency to express myself quite bluntly and I don't do it on purpose.\n\nTo adress your points though:\n\nYou make a good point about the feeling of wearing ear plugs or headphones itself potentially being negative stimulation. I'm not even gonna pretend like I have some perfect counter-point to that.\n\nNo, that is not the full picture of how I view autism, and no just because the way I described it in this thread doesn't fit how it presents itself in your life, doesn't mean that you're faking it.\n\nAnswering your second question is kinda difficult though. I have diagnosed ADD, but have suspected autism for a long time and my current partner who actually has a formal diagnosis of aspergers has been pointing out thing that I do as \"very autistic\" and I haven't felt like I've been able to explain them away under the banner of ADD/ADHD and I'm at the point of considering testing for it. If I were to have it, that diagnosis would let me know for sure as well as open more doors to managing every day life which I do struggle with.\n\nSo no, it's not as straight forward as just having autistic friends and family. \n\nWhile I have done a lot of research about the topic (mainly ADD, but also Autism as I suspect I might have it) I am by no means qualified to diagnose someone and I don't think it's possible even for a profession to give a diagnosis based on a single reddit post.\n\nHave a good continued day, fellow Redditor!", "I guess my thing is said sibling has been to different Dr's and psychologists and none have come with thus diagnosis.", "It is though", "Just answering the question you asked.", "It's very difficult to diagnose in many cases. I know many children and adults who it takes years to diagnose. It can be that they have already learned to mask. It can be the incompetence of the medical professional. It's often that Autism is a spectrum; so when one doesn't fit some of the original ideal symptoms of it, then one assumes they can't possibly be Autistic. Just spreading information because it is such a complex discussion, Autism itself.", "Yeah, I know. I just have no idea how I am ableist according to the other commenter.\n\nBut it also did look like they were trying to start fights in the comments."]}
