Unless it\u2019s now causing you issues because her siblings want this and it might affect you, if she buys her own food when she comes to you that\u2019s a bit rubbish to start with", "Instead of enjoying the very little shared parenting time you have with her, you\u2019re complaining about this? If I had to guess, it has more to do with Dad (and ex) giving her money to buy groceries at your house for her to cook. This isn\u2019t a good look for you. Also, she\u2019s 16. In many states (if this is in the U.S.), she can decide whose home she wants to go to. She can start refusing your overnights if this is a hill you want to die on.", "She should probably stop coming to your house then. Why should she waste her time with someone who just thinks she's a spoiled brat? I don't see any kindness towards her in this post. \n\nAlso making her eat with you is not going to solve the issue. Your kids are going to be exposed to new foods by their friends or their other relatives at family gatherings. Don't see spend money you don't have of course, but don't just stick to Mac and Cheese either.", "There weren\u2019t any when I first commented but Holy Missing Information, Batman. Wow. OP is a piece of work. Honestly should have been tipped off by the suspiciously short post.", "Right? I was with her at the beginning thinking this was a 6 year old having a tantrum! But no! Kid's 16, buys and cooks her own groceries and mom's just mad that she's being shown up for not making more of an effort for the younger kids.\n\nI mean, I love Kraft mac n cheese too, but is this every meal? Not good.", "My frustration with reddit in general.  So many people responders read and assume the original post is unbiased and 'gospel'.  If I pushback on a narrative that just doesn't ring true, then the reddit hoard pounce on me as the bad guy for simply asking questions or suggesting an alternative theory.  Welcome to social media I guess...", "She does. Read more of OPs replies", "Agreed. I ate a lot of restaurant food at 16 because I worked as a hostess and would get discounted meals there.", "The 16 year old does cook for herself, and she buys her own food", "Daughter buys her own food and cooks it herself. OP expects her to both cook *and* pay for extra for everyone.", "Because 16 year old buys her own groceries and cooks her own food.", "The 16 year old buys her own groceries and makes her own meals because OP feeds the family Kraft macaroni and cheese.", "She won't do either of that. She will just make a meal for herself and eat it right in front of the kids when she knows how much it bothers them.\n\nThe problem is that she does her own shopping and we are not allowed to touch anything she buys. Her dad gives her money and he is really rich. Most of the time I can't afford to cook the same meal as her even if I wanted to", "You just decided from one comment that I only make boxed mac and cheese? I know how to feed my kids I didn't ask your opinion on that", "Yes it is. She always goes for the most expensive items and foods.", "The thing is that it is a requirement for reddit to work, of course is biased, but you can only get one sided information, so you need to judge based on that. It is reddit not irl, of course there are 2 sides to every story, but usually you dont get them here, if you go around questioning everything reddit does not work.", "Why can\u2019t Mom just buy what her little kids want?\n\nIf sister is having salmon then add that to the grocery list for the family. \n\nIf Mom can\u2019t afford to buy the food sister is buying that\u2019s a separate problem.", "Wait so she's cooking for herself from groceries that aren't even yours?\n\n\nYou have literally no reason to be upset. You are teaching your younger children that they can dictate what other people can and cannot do by just having tantrums about it.\n\n\nSounds like the younger kids are the more spoiled ones in this situation. Great job!", "Ah, so you\u2019re a jealous asshole. Peep the \u201cher dad is rich\u201d part. OP is jealous because she doesn\u2019t have access to that money. \n\nThe younger ones are the spoiled ones. It\u2019s her groceries, that she bought with money that was given to her. You have no say in what she does with it.", "INFO: You and dad don't live together? Does he not pay child support for her? The money situation is confusing here.", "Can you offer her some money for her to buy more ingredients to cook for the whole family? You can offer to help her with cooking too, all the same time learn how to cook them so you can eventually cook them for your younger kids too. It's only the weekends, right?", "Then why do they always want her food? Either you are raising insanely jealous kids or the 16 year old is making more appealing and better foods. Take your pick and YTA. Learn to say no to your younger children or make them better food that they want more.", "Good thing you\u2019re not paying for it, asshole.", "You mean the best options. There aren't price tags in your pantry.", "It's easier said than done. We are on a budget. We can't afford it", "Apparently the daughter buys her own food and brings it to OP\u2019s home, but OP is still complaining because daughter isn\u2019t buying food for the other kids as well.", "Are there meals that she likes that you *can* afford to cook? Chili? Meatloaf? Etc. That way, everyone can eat the same meal. Surely filet mignon isn\u2019t the only food she eats and there are budget friendly meals she likes too.", "This is probably because OP cooks like ass, from the context clues given"]}
