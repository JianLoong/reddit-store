I get along very well with his dad \u201cRalph\u201d and we will all be spending Christmas at Ralph\u2019s place. For Christmas, I bought Ralph a travel bag and had it personalised with patches relating to significant countries he\u2019s traveled to. It\u2019s a bit tacky but I know he\u2019ll find it kitschy and use it as a gym bag or something, so perfect for a Christmas gift. \n\nI posted about this on Instagram and Laura saw it. She DM\u2019d me asking if I\u2019d be willing to swap Christmas gifts with her (She got Ralph a bottle of cognac). She said since Ralph has always disliked her this could be an opportunity for her to get into his good books. As much as I understood that, I said no, partly because I took a lot of time putting the gift together and partly because Laura doesn\u2019t know Ralph well, how would she even know about what a significant country would have been to add to the bag? It doesn\u2019t make sense for her to give it to him. Laura then got annoyed and said I should have some empathy for her given that Ralph has never hidden the fact that he likes me more than her and wishes Sebastian and I would date. I do have empathy and told her that, but I also think her saying that was a bit of emotional blackmail. \n\nLaura is now apparently bitching about me to mine and Sebastian\u2019s mutual friends, and posting passive aggressive things about \u201cthe best girl friend you have to worry about\u201d on social media. Sebastian hasn\u2019t mentioned it and I don\u2019t want to in case Laura never told him. \n\nI don\u2019t want to make Christmas awkward and I get how Laura must feel because Ralph is an intense person and you *know* when he doesn\u2019t like you.

I think the cleanest way for OP to disentangle herself from this would be to talk to gf and bf at the same time and tell her she gets it: Ralph is *not* easy to win over.

Her conversation with Sebastian should be exactly the same 'listen, your girlfriend approached me about swapping gifts with her for your dad.  I told her I didn't want to and she got a little rude.  Just wanted to give you a head's up.'  So you think he won't believe her? The focus is the intent of the conversation, (the gift swap) not a specific word she needs to show proof of or Sebastian saying 'I don't believe it, exactly what did she say'? Then sure...show text but I'm just saying it's unnecessary and seems petty. It's not show and tell, it's a conversation she's having with a friend."]}
