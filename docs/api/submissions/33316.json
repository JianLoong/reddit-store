Oh yeah, playing video games.", "I get that you need your meds on your nightstand for those days you can't get out of bed--but buy a small safe/lockbox for them.

Of course the brother sounds like a terrible parent, as well as the type of person who will lash out and blame others for his own failings. He sucks by far the most in this story. \n\nHowever: OP absolutely SHOULD have to lock her door when she's not in her room, or otherwise make sure the kid can't get at her meds and needles etc. Users of prescription drugs and medical equipment do in fact bear the responsibility of ensuring that they are not accessible to people, like small children, who could accidentally hurt themselves. I mean, there's a reason why pill bottles and lots of other products say KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN on the package (not, DON'T WORRY, IF THIS KILLS A CHILD, IT'S THE PARENTS' FAULT, NOT YOURS).
