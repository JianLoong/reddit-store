I'm sorry for your loss and for the difficulties you're having with wrapping up of your wife's / mom's affairs. \n\nYWBTA. I can see both sides of the tell or don't tell coin and imo, it's difficult to tell which would be the better option without knowing more about the dynamics of the relationship she had with her family. I feel that the most neutral approach would be to follow through with her wishes and trust her.\n\nOf course, they will eventually find out about her passing. (I might remind you that some places have a short courtesy announcement in the local paper.) However, I certainly wouldn't wait until a family event like a wedding to surprise them with that info. When they learn of her passing, they'll understandably feel sad and mournful for the loss of a loved one, but they'll also feel hurt and angry to learn that they weren't immediately notified. A wedding is a joyous occasion and is definitely not the proper place to break that sort of news. So I might advise you to notify her family, but wait until after you and the other friends and family have your memorial services and remembrances. They loved her too, and they deserve to know and grieve. \n\nSo, ywbta for telling them now. But also ywbta for not telling them at all. It's a difficult position to be in, I'm sure. \n\nI hope everything works out in the best way possible.\n\nEdit - wording for clarity.", "YWBTA. The entire point of a will and why we give people these kinds of decisions is that we have a pretty strong attachment to specifics concerning the state of our lives independent of even our existence. Therefore, even if the person in question is dead, we follow their will and their wishes about how to deal with their body/belongings/procession so that for those who are alive they can be assured the same process will happen for them and that their will will be carried out independent of whether the parties in question like it or not. By interfering here you're severing this very important demonstration and undermining the will of the dead to execute the last rights they have over their own lives, setting a precedent that others will watch.", "**YWBTA**\n\nI get your thought process but your wife clearly had her reasons. She knew these people better then you ever could, she was aware of her health issues and that it could likely affect her lifespan. Guaranteed she thought about this scenario a million times over. **If you feel that guilty maybe make a Facebook post that\u2019s public AFTER the funeral. That way you\u2019re not going against her wishes. I also have a feeling she suspected if they knew they\u2019d likely just crash her funeral not giving a damn about her wants, and that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t want them to know**. Don\u2019t think for a second that you can hide the where or when of it and can just tell them she passed. It\u2019s very easy for people to get those details without you telling them. **If you do decide to tell them PLEASE for the love of god don\u2019t tell them until after the funeral**. The fact it\u2019s also possible they wouldn\u2019t find out for years is also a testament to how little they must care for her, that even estranged they don\u2019t check for her on social media and wouldn\u2019t find our relatively quickly.

My half sister had him walk her down the aisle when she was married.  My half brother didn't like when I would get into it with my mother.

Tell them at the wedding?\" Which is a huge asshole thing to do to people who are not only still alive, but also dont deserve to have their wedding ruined for a death reveal.
