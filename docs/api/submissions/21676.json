She had been dealing with long term health issues but we were not expecting her to pass like she did. However, there had been conversations about how she wanted her affairs handled so we know what she wanted in terms of a funeral and such. My daughter and I are struggling with how to handle one of her last requests though. She had been estranged from most of  her siblings for some time and the relationships she did have with them were very complicated. She was adamant that they not be invited to her celebration of life, which we will honor, but several times she indicated that she didn't even want them to be notified if she passed. That's what we're struggling with, because it seems cruel. Would I be an asshole if I informed them she had passed despite what my wife requested?\n\nETA: her siblings are the only family remaining on her side. If we do not inform them it's likely they will not find out for potentially years (or until my daughter and I go to a niece's wedding in October and everyone asks where Aunt is)", "created_utc": 1688826504, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14u5p5j/wibta_for_not_following_my_all_of_wifes_last/", "score": 9, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can notify them if you like, but it might be prudent to wait until any issues of inheritance and the will are settled first. \n\nYour wife had her reasons for not wanting them told. Proceed with caution and make sure they can't touch anything she owned or ruin your daughter's inheritance in any way.", "YWBTA. Your wife\u2019s relationship with her siblings was between her and them. If she didn\u2019t want them notified, she had good reason. Leave it alone.", "YWBTA in my opinion. There are reasons *why* your mom/wife asked this and has said it several times! I would assume at some point some other family member will tell a sibling or two and the rest will find out after the fact. It would just not be coming from you which mean you would be honoring her wishes.", "YWBTA. You have no idea what kind of can of worms you may open up by telling them. Focus on you and your child.", "NAH. I see no reason to not to follow her request unless you and your children feel you would benefit from their support. Quietly hold a private service, request there be no public announcement and when the family finds out, and they will, you and the children need only say, we followed her wishes. I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "YTA that\u2019s her choice to not tell them so u shouldn\u2019t.", "If that is your wife\u2019s last wishes, then yes you have to honor them. YWBTA \nIf the tables were turned, you\u2019d want your last wishes honored, yes?", "NTA. Wait until after the celebration of life so they don't try to go, that's drama no one needs, but if you think it's best to tell them rather than deal with it when they try to contact her then tell them. You're the one who has to deal with any repercussions from telling them or not so it should be your decision to make. It doesn't affect your wife in any way if you tell them or not and you don't need to grieve plus feel guilty about being cruel, I doubt your wife disliked her siblings more than she'd want you to do what you feel needs to be done.", "Don't go against her dying wish! Respect the last thing she asked of you. Focus on your son instead. YTA", "NTA.  My dad didn't want a memorial, but my mom asked if it'd be bad if she held one. I said - hey, he won't be there, so why not.  It made her feel better.  I'm not sure what harm it would do if you informed them, unless you think they may try to come after some form of inheritance.  I think if it makes you and your daughter feel better to inform them, go ahead and do it.  Your wife won't know.", "Personally, I think YWBTA. She was your WIFE, your priority in life, and this is something she\u2019d clearly thought long and hard about. You need to continue to prioritise her wishes even though she\u2019s no longer here to witness you doing so. I\u2019m sorry for your loss", "NAH, but things could get dicey at the wedding.  Since you are on good enough terms to have accepted the wedding invitation, you might want to reach out to the parents of the niece and explain \"Unfortunately, Aunt passed away suddenly very recently.  We did our best to follow her wishes but since we don't want any awkwardness at the wedding, we did want to let you know so no one is wondering where she is.\"  My condolences to you and your dad on the loss of your mom/wife.  I'm sorry you find yourselves in this challenging situation.", "You are never bound by unreasonable requests of a decedent. NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They will find out eventually and it might be easier all round if the news doesn't break at the wedding.
