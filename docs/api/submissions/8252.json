My mum has 3 kids and my dad has three kids, I only share one parent with all of my siblings. \n\nI had a difficult childhood. Dad wanted my mum to abort me and she refused. My mum was a single mum for the entirety of my life and all of my siblings are either much way older or way younger than me so I have always felt like an only child. As soon as my older sister from my mums side, let's call her Jane, was old enough my mum worked and she looked after me. Mum didn't know that Jane was a hard drug user and so I was left in drug dens with creepy old men whilst she'd get high and I still have a lot of trauma from that. Jane regularly hurt me and the people around her and I was so young not really understanding until one day I was old enough to fight back and cut her out of my life for good. \n\nI have an older brother on my mums side who I did not find out about until I was 6 years old. Mum had him young and was forced to give him up and she found him again in prison. For about 10 years I visited a high security prison every weekend up until I had nearly finished high school. Lots of my memories are very sad and when he finally got out our relationship basically deteriorated. He fell out with my mum and as a result stopped talking to me as well when I was in my.first year of university. \n\nMy dead beat dad that never did anything for me and left me and my mum to fend for ourselves. He didn't pay child support, and went into prison for drug dealing when I was in high school just after my older brother got out. I refused to go visit any more prisons. Because of our broken relationship I have never had any kind of relationship with my siblings on his side. I have two nephews, one I have met once when I was younger. Haven't seen me younger two siblings in years and now Jane and my older brother each have kids of their own, so 5 nieces/nephews in total. Haven't seen them, don't really care to. \n\nThe reason why I'm writing this is because of what happened recently with a friend who is currently grieving a family loss. I struggle to comprehend because I literally only have my mum and my friends who are my chosen family. But my friend got angry at me saying that I'm so lucky to have all this family at the palm of my hands that I just don't take advantage of. Now this person knows a little bit about my history, enough to know I had a difficult childhood, and so  this really hurt me. I got mad and said that they were lucky to have people who loved them even if they were now dead, and that being unwanted is a different type of grief. She told me that I should just get over myself and that if multiple people in my family treat me like an outcast then maybe I'm the problem and not them.\n\nI stormed off in tears. Mutual friends started calling telling me I was an arsehole and that I shouldn't have blown up at her when she was grieving.

You're both dealing with a difficult situations, and it's normal to unleash. It sucks that you can't understand her situation, just like it sucks she doesn't get yours.

Your friend is wrong, very, very sheltered and grief-addled to say something so incredibly ridiculous, confusing and hurtful to you if tgey know ANY of your history.

But that isn't your reality. Trying to compare the two is just ridiculous, and she was just plain cruel for her comments. For the record, you are NOT the problem! You escaped the abusive environment you grew up in and left the toxic people behind. This random Internet stranger is proud of you! It sounds like she's saying this all out of grief, but that doesn't excuse what she said or mean you just have to sit there and take it. She sounds like she has friends supporting her, I would personally stay clear of her for a while.", "NTA - \n\nThis feels like the type of situation where your friend lashed out in grief, and you in response lashed out in trauma, but also like. It's incredibly shitty to say that to someone, regardless of the reason, and your reaction is more than understandable.\n\nYou cutting off a toxic family is entirely justified, and youre not an asshole for not wanting to reconnect with any of them. Your friend acting like you're lucky is at **best** ignorance of how badly this all can hurt.   \n\n\nalso, implying you are somehow responsible for your situation as a kid is so fucking shitty.

Depending on how close you were before you may find a conversation or two set\u2019s things right. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for the pain of your childhood. It sounds horrible.

Your friend is viewing things through a lens of grief, probably because they've never had a traumatic and toxic family.

We had a recent loss, and I told my children there was no right way to grieve, as long as they were kind to others who might not be grieving the same. OP, your friend was unkind, and took her grief out on you. She was waaaaay out of line. Your answer was correct, she should be glad she was loved instead of telling you to appreciate your abusers. I\u2019m so sorry. Hopefully time will bring her around."]}
