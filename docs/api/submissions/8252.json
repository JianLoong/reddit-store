My mum has 3 kids and my dad has three kids, I only share one parent with all of my siblings. \n\nI had a difficult childhood. Dad wanted my mum to abort me and she refused. My mum was a single mum for the entirety of my life and all of my siblings are either much way older or way younger than me so I have always felt like an only child. As soon as my older sister from my mums side, let's call her Jane, was old enough my mum worked and she looked after me. Mum didn't know that Jane was a hard drug user and so I was left in drug dens with creepy old men whilst she'd get high and I still have a lot of trauma from that. Jane regularly hurt me and the people around her and I was so young not really understanding until one day I was old enough to fight back and cut her out of my life for good. \n\nI have an older brother on my mums side who I did not find out about until I was 6 years old. Mum had him young and was forced to give him up and she found him again in prison. For about 10 years I visited a high security prison every weekend up until I had nearly finished high school. Lots of my memories are very sad and when he finally got out our relationship basically deteriorated. He fell out with my mum and as a result stopped talking to me as well when I was in my.first year of university. \n\nMy dead beat dad that never did anything for me and left me and my mum to fend for ourselves. He didn't pay child support, and went into prison for drug dealing when I was in high school just after my older brother got out. I refused to go visit any more prisons. Because of our broken relationship I have never had any kind of relationship with my siblings on his side. I have two nephews, one I have met once when I was younger. Haven't seen me younger two siblings in years and now Jane and my older brother each have kids of their own, so 5 nieces/nephews in total. Haven't seen them, don't really care to. \n\nThe reason why I'm writing this is because of what happened recently with a friend who is currently grieving a family loss. I struggle to comprehend because I literally only have my mum and my friends who are my chosen family. But my friend got angry at me saying that I'm so lucky to have all this family at the palm of my hands that I just don't take advantage of. Now this person knows a little bit about my history, enough to know I had a difficult childhood, and so  this really hurt me. I got mad and said that they were lucky to have people who loved them even if they were now dead, and that being unwanted is a different type of grief. She told me that I should just get over myself and that if multiple people in my family treat me like an outcast then maybe I'm the problem and not them.\n\nI stormed off in tears. Mutual friends started calling telling me I was an arsehole and that I shouldn't have blown up at her when she was grieving.

I\u2019m so sorry. Hopefully time will bring her around.", "NTA.  You dont her validation to feel the way u feel.", "NTA - I went through grief and never once lashed out at another person. I don't understand why people always excuse shitty behavior. Yes it's more understandable but at the end of the day people have to be accountable for what they do.", "NTA but\n\nI actually have a kinda similar story. Me and my bf met in our early 20s, we were best friends for over 3 years before we got together and we\u2019ve now been together for over 4 years. I had a bad childhood as well, the only relevant part to this story being that I felt like I\u2019d never had a mother as my mother had treated me horribly and - being the oldest of 5 - I was not only my own mother but my sisters\u2019 AND my mom\u2019s as well. Meanwhile, he was very close with his mom and she had passed away almost exactly a year before we met. We had some tension/arguments about exactly what you said. Story goes pretty much the same as yours: he would say things like \u201cat least you have a mom\u201d which was extremely hurtful to me considering he knew all about my past and relationship with her. I\u2019m not sure if I ever said it to him but I would always think something like \u201cAt least you had a mom who loved you and you\u2019re allowed to grieve her. I have a mom who hates me and I\u2019m supposed to be grateful for that, I\u2019m not allowed to talk about how I feel with most people, I\u2019m not even allowed to feel the way I do, and now even my best friend is against me.\u201d\n\nObviously you can\u2019t compare grief with trauma and say that one is better than the other. The point of my comment is to say that 1) with her tragedy so fresh she may need some time before she\u2019s able to talk with you about it, and 2) I completely understand where you\u2019re coming from, though our situations were physically different the sentiments are the same. It can be especially hard when it seems like the entire world - especially people you\u2019re close to - refuse to understand and expect you to have a relationship with people who\u2019ve hurt you just because they exist and share blood.\n\nGive your friends some time, say you\u2019re sorry that you went off on her especially while she was grieving but ask if they\u2019ll please try to understand how their comments have hurt you. They may never completely understand but you all should be able to come to an understanding with each other assuming everyone cares about each other. Again, it may take time. But also don\u2019t allow them to walk all over you about it. If they won\u2019t at least hear you out then you definitely need new friends. There are plenty of people out there who understand your situation and won\u2019t guilt you for not \u201cbeing grateful for what you have\u201d when what you have is a bunch of toxic relatives who you\u2019ve rightfully cut contact with.", "NTA.. not everyone has a fairytale family. Your friends should know that", "Nta", "NTA\n\nYour friend is spouting complete crap and your other friends are letting her. Next time you talk to her tell she's right.

It's totally your fault that your felon older brother stopped talking to you cuz he doesn't like your mum.

Tough to judge anyone in the midst of suffering a loss an AH. Tough to judge someone with OP's history as the AH. \n\nSo I'm going with NAH. Both OP and Friend have ample reason to feel how they feel, even though their feelings bring them into conflict. OP, I am with you 100% for the reasons you dont want to have anything to do with Dad or Jane. Unless they have a life altering turn around and come begging for forgiveness, which they both need to do, keeping them out of your life is very reasonable. Older bro for whatever reason is excluding you, which given the years long effort you made as a teenager to connect with him seems very unfair, so until he decides to stop being an AH towards you there isnt much you can do about him. \n\nBut the younger ones........\n\nI get that they are Dad's kids and a relationship with them means proximity to him, which is repulsive to think about. But so far they are innocent and have not harmed you at all. If I were you I would explore the possibility of a relationship with them. Which could help heal the hurts family has caused you in the past. Every family has a black sheep. Most have a couple of white ones too. And you could be the reason they dont become black sheep. Having at least one solid healthy relationship can sometimes mean the difference between someone taking the good path versus bad path in life.
