I can understand that Anne wants her wedding pictures to look exactly how she imagined them, but I think that the idea my younger sister proposed was very reasonable.\n\nI congratulated Anne and her husband one last time, but then I said my goodbyes.

It's a wedding picture, one of thousands; let the bride have her silly boy-girl Pinterest picture and take one with your husband afterwards.\n\nOn the other hand, I could be wrong and he was invited to the wedding and asked to pose like this to dig at him; not impossible.", "People can have opinions. That's the whole point of reddit...", "What does this have to do with homophobia?", "Because the bride didn't want that picture.", "OP said nothing about homophobia.", "Obviously the sister does not respect or even acknowledge the marriage even after 7 years. She wanted ALL sibling AND partners but not the one gay married spouse?  NTA and I\u2019m glad OP left and supported his spouse.", "LOL! I didn't even work that part out, but NTA either way. This just means I like OPs sister even less.\n\nI rarely remember the gender of posts on here even when the OP states. And I'm okay about that.", "But it was more than boy girl. Because there was a solution offered to make it boy/girl next to each other and it wasn\u2019t good enough for the bride.", "Well, it sounds like you'd have no respect for yourself or your partner.", "She didn't want them standing together because they're a gay couple. That is literally the definition of homophobia.", "Your reading comprehension skills are very limited if you are unable to pick up on that based on the context.", "Why else would man and man make the aesthetic off?", "Read between the lines.", "I agree that this was a stupid decision by the bride and I'm not sure why she made it. \n\nBut we're not given any indication by the writer that her decision was motivated by bigotry. And it seems odd to invite someone and their partner to a wedding and then take a dig at them in the posing of pictures. \n\nAgain, I could be wrong, but it seems more like she had a very specific thing in mind and wanted it realized.", "Agreed, I would've done the exact thing op did. I would've compromised with the suggestion of the little sister, wouldn't be happy about it though.", "But because she didn't specifically say that it was because they were gay that gives every other homophobe an excuse to pretend that's not exactly what happened. They had a perfect solution that should have been exactly what she claimed she wanted. It would have been all siblings and their partners, with the genders alternating."]}
