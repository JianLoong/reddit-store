I can understand that Anne wants her wedding pictures to look exactly how she imagined them, but I think that the idea my younger sister proposed was very reasonable.\n\nI congratulated Anne and her husband one last time, but then I said my goodbyes. When I was asked why we were leaving early (especially before taking the pictures), I said that I didn\u2019t feel like our presence was wanted.\n\nWe left before dinner was served and I took Mark out to his favorite restaurant to cheer him up a little.\n\nAnne has texted me since saying that I was being overdramatic and making a fuss over nothing. Our parents have tried to remain neutral, but expect for my youngest sister, the rest of the family supports Anne and thinks that leaving early was going too far and that I should\u2019ve sucked it up instead of ruining her big day.\n\nEDIT: typos\n\nEDIT 2 because there was some confusion:\n\nMy husband is able bodied and white (so is most of my family), but we are indeed a gay couple.", "created_utc": 1687272801, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14eda0w/aita_for_leaving_my_sisters_wedding_early_because/", "score": 4803, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She said she wanted the pictures to be arranged boy-girl-boy-girl, but then when that was offered, she *still* told OP's partner he couldn't be in the photos. It's kind of hard to look at that behavior and not think bigotry is at play when she explicitly turns down an opportunity that gives her what she wants. \n\nAlso, if you want pictures of your family and in laws and know there's going to be an uneven number that messes with the aesthetic you want, you'd normally come up with a new aesthetic. Why didn't OP change up the idea and have the women in the front and the men in the back or something? Deliberately picking an aesthetic that gives you an excuse to exclude the only gay partner in your family is suspicious, especially when you double down on it.\n\nEdit: As for the bride inviting OP and his partner to the wedding, I think it would be *a lot* more suspicious if she refused to give OP a plus one instead of just excluding Mark from the pictures. There's no way letting all your siblings except one be able to bring their partners to your wedding isn't going to cause issues that she likely wants to avoid.

Unfortunately, a lot of ppl are good at not being open about their bigotry if they think it'll cause other ppl to look down on them-instead, it'll manifest in passive-aggressive ways like this. The fact that OP doesn't call it homophobia doesn't mean  that's not what it is. \n\n>But leaving a sibling's wedding because your husband was excluded from one photo early on in the picture taking for an ostensibly visual reason is an overreaction in my opinion.\n\nIt's hard to tell if it was just one picture or multiple, bc OP uses both singular and plural terms when using the word picture. But I also think the sister set the precedent, no? Like, if you're gonna care more about celebrating the aesthetics of something rather than celebrating the fact that your whole family is here to support you, then why should you care when said family leaves early?\n\nEdit: Also, OP says it was a photo the sister wanted of the siblings and their partners. It sounds pretty special, especially if that was the only one she was gonna take of them. If that was the case, the fact that she excluded Mark stands out even more, and is not just a slap in the face to Mark but to OP as well.", "It's a gallows humour thing. Like, \"I knew there was going to be bigotry but, darn it, I guessed the wrong type this time\". I also laughed out loud. My assumption was disability, but it was homophobia."]}
