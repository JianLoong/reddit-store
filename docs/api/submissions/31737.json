Because, at 11 years old, your son doesn't get to choose whether or not he sees you.  And it's likely that your Ex is actually keeping your son from you and/or telling him things to intentionally alter your son's relationship with you.\n\nTell your Ex that you're going to pick your kids up for your court appointed visits going forward, including holidays.", "NTA. \n\nBut why haven\u2019t you filed with the court that she\u2019s in contempt of the custody agreement? \n\nAnd why haven\u2019t you filed with the court about the educational issue so that it\u2019s clear that she can\u2019t try to homeschool without your permission?\n\nThese are big legal issues. Stop letting her tell you what\u2019s going to happen as though it\u2019s her decision to make.", "No NTA. \n\nI have a step son and my husband and I have him every other week. Good co parenting is about looking out for each other and not using the kids as pawns. I don\u2019t your ex is using them as pawns but I do feel like your ex should be encouraging your children, more specifically the one you haven\u2019t seen in 4 weeks, to make up with you. \n\nIt\u2019s not fair that you haven\u2019t seen your child in 4 weeks and it\u2019s not fair that your ex seems to not be doing a whole lot to help you. \n\nIt should be a discussion between you and your ex on what schooling he has, and you should be a united front when you make that decision. Children are smart and know how to play their parents, if they know that you guys aren\u2019t working together or a united front or know how to pit you two against each other, co parenting is going to continue being hard. \n\nAs for the Christmas presents - if they did do christmas at yours, was your ex going to give their presents to you to give out on the day or were they going to celebrate on another day with the kids? If on another day, why should they expect you to?", "If you don't show up to pick up the children on schedule, regardless of what your ex says, it can be used against you in court if she tries to get full custody and child support.   Even if she tells you no, or that the kids don't want to go. Consult a lawyer, which is cheaper than 10+ years of child support.", "NTA. Homeschooling is not easy, and the only reason you\u2019re doing it for your oldest is because it\u2019s necessary. You\u2019re right that an 11 year old might see it as just wanting to be home and doesn\u2019t fully understand what actually goes into homeschooling. You and your ex would be taking care of all his schooling on top of your oldest\u2019s, and that just might not be feasible. Teachers earn degrees for a reason; not everyone can do their job. \n\nYour 11 year old should be learning that refusing to see dad is not an option unless there was some sort of abuse/neglect going on. If you and your ex weren\u2019t divorced, he\u2019d still have to see you even though he\u2019s upset. \n\nDo you know why he wants to be homeschooled? Is he being bullied? Does he think it would just be fun to be home from school?", "NTA- must be present to win.  When he\u2019s ready to celebrate with you at your house his gifts will be there.  You sending them to her house is just reinforcing bad behavior of pouting when he doesn\u2019t get his way. She is also reinforcing that bad behavior.\nI\u2019d suggest reaching out to your attorney and get a meeting set up between you two and make sure your attorney\u2019s are there to get this resolved.  Sounds like she may be using this to gain favor and possible custody.", "Info. Why is he only blaming you? Are you and your ex in agreement on this, or is his mother happy for him to be home schooled?", "NTA\n\nFile with the court ASAP that your wife is in violation of the custody agreement.  Once you let them take an inch, a mile will not be far behind.\n\nShe is using your son to manipulate you into doing what she wants.  Don't let her get away with it.", "No NTA", "Info:  Have you actually discussed why your 11 year old wants to be homeschooled?  Ignore his grades they are irrelevant to this question.  Is he being bullied at school?  Is he upset that his brother gets to stay home when he has to go to school.  Is this about the conscience for the mother rather than the kid? Is the current curriculum to slow for your kid and he is bored?\n\nThere is more to sending a kid to school than just grades.  You need to find out why instead of saying no.  These questions need to be answered and even though you disagree you should validate his ability to speak his opinion on the matter.  \n\nThink of it this way.  Right now he is giving his opinion on how he wants to be educated.  You immediately said no to him but allow his brother to be homeschooled.  What happens when this is an issue that is more dangerous.  For a lot of kids if one opinion is shot down than they turn to all things that they know they shouldn\u2019t do.  \n\nWell I am a bad kid because I\u2019m not allowed to be homeschooled like my brother.  Can turn into a kid trying drugs and sex to early.  Especially if they have low self esteem.\n\nAgain parents need to say no but they also need to value the kids opinions.  If they can\u2019t be open about small things what will happen with sex and such.", "NTA but this isn't a reddit issue. You need to speak to a family attorney, because your ex is violating the terms of the custody arrangement.", "NTA", " NTA", "ESH, excluding the kids.\n\nLook, dude, your younger son wants to be home-schooled because he sees it as special time and attention you devote to your older son that he doesn't get. You can't plaster over that with \"well, school is good for you\" and not expect it to damage to your relationship.

They currently feel that they\u2019re being treated differently to their sibling, that the sibling is getting preferential treatment. Address that somehow. You might lose this fight, since homeschooling is within your capacity. I agree that school sounds best for them- but you\u2019ll have to find a way to heal that impression they\u2019re second best to you, and Christmas present denial makes you grinch or Scrooge for life.\n\nEdited- changed to ESH.

Likewise,if I have a neurodivergent child who is struggling mightily in school due to overstimulation or other problems, and I switch that child to homeschooling because he otherwise *cannot learn*, it would be wrong to also switch his brother, who is doing just fine in school, to homeschooling, because that is *not something the brother needs*.
