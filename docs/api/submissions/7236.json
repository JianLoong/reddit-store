I parked 2 levels underground in the parking garage.  I go to take the elevator up to floor 1. Two other people and I get in.  It stops on underground level 1.  Door opens.  A lady with about a 30 pound  dog is waiting to get on.  I'm not comfortable around dogs at all.  I do my best to avoid them.  I politely ask her if she can wait for the next one and let her know i'm uncomfortable around dogs.  She simply says \"no, we are getting on\". \n\nWell this pisses me off. I respond with \"Really?  You are going to be an inconsiderate bitch and force me to be around your dog?\".  She just looks at me shocked. Doors open.  She calls me an asshole and quickly walks off.

Just because a lot of people like dogs doesn\u2019t mean that dog owners should have free reign to drag their animal anywhere with no consideration for those around them.", "As a dog owner myself I would have waited if someone asked me. That\u2019s me, it might not be you. I think the dog woman is irresponsible for saying \u201cno, we are getting on\u201d you never know with people how they will react, case in point OP lost her shit and started calling her names. I personally would not let my dog be around some who appears to wound up so tight they could snap. I have been around dogs my whole life from tiny little guys to massive guys. I am totally cool with being an outlier in this situation I actually started with n t a but then I started thinking about my next door neighbors dog. I always took my dog around the house because he actually scared me, not because he was mean but he was freaking huge, his head was bigger than my head and he wouldn\u2019t have to jump far to bite my face. The first time I met him he came right up to me, the GC told me he was huge and mean. I froze, he kept nudging my hand to pet him so I did. He went to my husband who is not an animal person at all, smelled him and kept going down the line until he got to the contractor and you could see the dogs demeanor change. The owner recalled him and he kept his eyes on the GC and he went to attention. I tell you this because not all dogs are the same. Please understand I am taking OPs side she is the one who started the whole thing and she is the one who escalated the issue.", "Yes thank you for your comment, I\u2019m realizing maybe I accommodate others a bit too much,", "If she did something to my dog I would throw hands she has the problem. No one should have to bend to her will in public. It\u2019s her responsibility.", "Hey as someone with serious dog allergies, I really appreciate people like you who ask before approaching. I will move my seat in a restaurant/on a plane/etc if a dog is sitting near me but SO MANY people just approach me with dogs while I\u2019m out in the world and I don\u2019t notice until it\u2019s too late. Like, if I\u2019m at the store and you come up behind me with a dog for too long before I notice, I can have an asthma attack. If I\u2019m at the park and you walk past me on a trail too closely and your dog licks me or brushes up against me I can break out in hives and/or end up sick for the rest of the day.\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re being too considerate to ask people before approaching them with an animal. Animals are great but they are not people and with it becoming more and more common to allow dogs in stores/restaurants/etc it\u2019s becoming increasingly hard for me to just be out in the world as a human being doing person things. Dogs don\u2019t have more right to be in a space than I do and a warning and/or a little understanding from dog owners should be expected when you are in a public location that isn\u2019t intended for dogs (dog park, business that specifically markets being dog friendly, etc) \n\nSo, thanks for being a good person and I hope this thread doesn\u2019t sway you from being considerate when you\u2019re out with the dogs! \u2665\ufe0f", "I agree with that."]}
