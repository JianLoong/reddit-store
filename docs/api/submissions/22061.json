I wonder if the reason your parents are refusing to help pay for the consult is because the surgery is \u2018experimental\u2019 and they feel that the surgery won\u2019t work?

Figure a way to pay the bill and y\u2019all go no contact with them.", "Most definitely NTA, but I'd your parents are TA and arguably abusive for denying her medical care. As someone who herniated a disc at 16 and had a discectomy at 17, I feel your sister's pain. It's an invisible ailment and it's incredibly rare for it to happen to young women. I went undiagnosed by my pediatrician for 9 months (my parents didn't know who else to take me to as they'd never heard of osteopathic medicine). Even after a positive MRI, I was often told by adults that I was wrong about my diagnosis (e.g. \"that doesn't sound right for your age, it's just a pulled muscle\"). \n\nYou are doing an amazing thing for your sister. Not to sound ominous, but please take my advice as someone who went through it: if this is not addressed now and she learns how to take care of her spine before it gets debilitating, it will plague her for years to come. Joint health, muscle flexibility, stress, anxiety, and the body's general ability to heal itself will only get more difficult and cumbersome as she ages. She needs to find her routine to manage and prevent pain before it can have a negative impact on her future happiness.", "Check the plan provisions for the health insurance plan. Often times the insurance company denies claims that should be covered. If you think the consultation should be covered, you can appeal the claim denial. Also, your mother\u2019s company may have an advocate or HR to help with situations like this. Good luck, and hope the surgery is successful.", "NTA. WTF you can spend $250 on a dinner but can't help out your daughter who's trying to relieve long term pain? That one dinner is more than half the fee.

She told one of her high school friend\u2019s mom about it and the mom also gave her $100", "I'm not sure that's relevant, but as for medical debt, it depends on the state, the hospital, and the insurance the parents have. Most professionals making 100k+ as the OP's dad does have health insurance that would cover 90% or more of the cost so the bills were likely minor, a few thousand at most. Of course, any parent who would present their child with a bill for anything at 16 is a complete AH and shouldn't be a parent.", "you think a 19 year old, dealing with sciatica, should be working full time because it's summer? you do realize summer for college students is *not* the same as summer for highschool students, yes?", "She still has other bills and needs to eat.

That was a random off the top \"I've heard this about America and these people sound evil\" kind of comment\ud83e\udd23\n\nAlso I assumed my blanket statement was very much a stereotypes, thanks for clearing it up\ud83d\ude42 there are too many states for you to go into details though\ud83d\ude02", "Insurance companies are usually super fickle when it comes to \u201cexperimental\u201d treatments as well.

He gets cosmetic surgery done regularly. He makes a lot more money than my mom as well (like well over $100,000 a year)", "Thanks! And there are too many states for me to even KNOW how they all work lol.", "Yes, I did see that, but that's not quite the same as saying he knows his dad has the money; for the mom he made it clear he knows for sure she does.  But you're right, 99% chance the dad is an AH too.", "That's absolutely fair. Honestly some days I'm surprised I remember there are 50, let alone what they all are.

(OP is a she, btw)", "And two Virginias too lol", "Opps yes, she is, my mistake!  My point was the OP said she knew her dad spent a ton of money on veneers and made 100k. That doesn't mean he has $450 to spare especially if he has a big child support bill and spent all his spare money on those veneers, they aren't cheap. Also, 100k is barely a new graduate salary in a lot of places so that doesn't mean much depending on where they live. PROBABLY he is an AH, I agree, but not enough evidence to prove it.", "I've heard good things though...but considering my original comment I could be wrong\n\nThankfully only one Florida though...right?!?!?!", "Unless they\u2019ve got younger siblings, the dad wouldn\u2019t be paying child support for OP or her sister as they\u2019re both 18+. \n\nSeems a bit crazy to think the dad couldn\u2019t cough up $450 for his daughter\u2019s medical expenses out of his $100K salary when he was perfectly happy spending money on elective plastic surgery for himself.\n\nAnd to think that the mom, who makes significantly less, is somehow more of an AH because she spent $250 on a steak dinner.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong\u2014both parents suck. I would beg, borrow, or steal to alleviate my kid\u2019s suffering.

He might also be paying spousal support to his ex too. I do agree with you that he is an AH for not trying to get the money any way he could, 100%, you're totally right. My comment was just that it is at least possible that he didn't actually have it, doesn't mean he isn't an AH. I edited my original post too based on your comment.", "Not exactly an assumption, just a possibility. Depending on where they live, 100k might be barely a new graduate salary let alone a salary for a working professional and parent. The \"dad\" is still a total AH for not borrowing against his 401k, or selling something, taking a loan, begging or doing anything else to take care of his daughter if he doesn't actually have the cash though.", "Okay. I\u2019ll concede the possibility that he might be paying child support. But we can\u2019t assume it.\n\nStill seems weird to call out only the mom and not the dad here in your initial comment. Just not sure why you\u2019re giving him the benefit of the doubt but not her. He\u2019s allowed to spend his money on elective plastic surgery but she\u2019s an AH for spending hers on a steak dinner? She must be able to afford it but he\u2019s probably cash-strapped? I\u2019m just not following your reasoning."]}
