For the last year or so anytime I see her she\u2019s limping and just obviously in a lot of pain. It is heartbreaking.\n\nKenna is currently a rising sophomore in college on a full ride, so so far she hasn\u2019t had to take out loans. She is back in our hometown living with my mom for the summer. A few months ago, after doing a few other things for her sciatica that did not help, she decided to do this new experimental treatment/surgery to try to help the pain. She is on my mom\u2019s insurance which isn\u2019t the best (parents are divorced). Insurance agreed to cover the surgery, but for some reason they would not cover the consultation/initial fee for seeing this specialist doctor. The fee was $450. She (a college student working a serving job for the summer) doesn\u2019t have $450. She asked both of my parents for help and both of them told her that the other parent should have to pay for it. When neither of them would, they both ultimately told her that she was on the hook for it herself and that she needed to get a credit card to pay for it. \n\nI sort of understand my mom\u2019s perspective because she doesn\u2019t make a ton of money, but also I know that she definitely has $450 to spare. Last week she took me and all of my siblings out to a steakhouse and the bill was $250 and she had no problem paying that (it was not some special occasion either). She goes out to bars with her friends every weekend too. My dad refused to help her despite the fact that less than 2 months ago he got a full set of veneers. He gets cosmetic surgery done regularly. He makes a lot more than my mom as well (like well over $100,000 a year).\n\nWhen my sister called me crying saying that she had no idea how she would come up with the money I called both of them and yelled at them for how selfish they were being. I called them hypocrites, and told them that they were pathetic and they shouldn\u2019t be surprised when they get old and we don\u2019t want to take care of them. I was admittedly name-calling and being very harsh. Both of them always talk about how horrible that it is that my sister is always in pain and how they feel so bad for her, but when it comes down to it neither of them are willing to spare anything to help her. Am I in the wrong for yelling at them and calling them selfish, and also for thinking that my sister is entitled to $450?\n\nEdit: thank you everyone for the kind words and advice it has been really helpful. For those of you saying I/we should go no contact with them: no. I love my parents unconditionally, regardless of their (in my opinion) poor choices and blatant disregard for my sister\u2019s feelings. That\u2019s not to say that their behavior wasn\u2019t disgusting and awful, but this is an example of people demonstrating shitty and disappointing behavior, not an example of them being shitty people as a whole. Maybe that\u2019s me subconsciously trying to protect myself from the reality of all of this, but these people raised me and made me the woman I am today and one fuck up on their part (albeit it major) is not going to make me or us throw away an entire relationship.", "created_utc": 1689200392, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14y2l25/aita_for_screaming_at_both_of_my_parents_for/", "score": 823, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I went undiagnosed by my pediatrician for 9 months (my parents didn't know who else to take me to as they'd never heard of osteopathic medicine).

Not to sound ominous, but please take my advice as someone who went through it: if this is not addressed now and she learns how to take care of her spine before it gets debilitating, it will plague her for years to come. Joint health, muscle flexibility, stress, anxiety, and the body's general ability to heal itself will only get more difficult and cumbersome as she ages.

That doesn't mean he has $450 to spare especially if he has a big child support bill and spent all his spare money on those veneers, they aren't cheap. Also, 100k is barely a new graduate salary in a lot of places so that doesn't mean much depending on where they live.

He might also be paying spousal support to his ex too. I do agree with you that he is an AH for not trying to get the money any way he could, 100%, you're totally right.

I\u2019ll concede the possibility that he might be paying child support. But we can\u2019t assume it.\n\nStill seems weird to call out only the mom and not the dad here in your initial comment.

Feel free to yell your head off.\n\nNTA!!!!!!!!\n\nIn terms of your sister, a couple of things.  First, if this hasn't happened already, a.) look carefully at what her insurance policy says.  If she hasn't already appealed, appeal their denial.  Also, b.) contact the state insurance commissioner and find out how to file a complaint.  File that complaint!!!  (I'm assuming U.S. because of the health insurance issue.)  Also, c.) talk with the doctor and show his office the denial.  It may be that if he changes the coding for the visit or if he writes to the insurance company, this could be effective.\n\nSecond, credit cards have terrible interest and your sister doesn't need to launch her adult life with one of these.  She will be paying back way more than what she's put on the card.  I would suggest that she googles free loan societies.  Some charitable, ethnic, and religious organizations have them.  I know that there's a Jewish Free Loan society, and you don't have to be Jewish to get a loan from them.  At least that way she won't be stuck with more than $450 to pay back.", "What rat bastards.

It's basically a third party service that works with medical providers to allow interest free installments on a set timeline.  I just opened up one because my dog needs an expensive diagnostic procedure - the vet charges it to the Care Credit card, and I have 6 months to pay it off in set installments before interest gets charged.  Some plans also have 12, 18, or 24 month periods, it varies by provider.\n\nIt took me literally less than 5 minutes to apply and I got approved for way more than I needed, which is awesome in case there are unexpected things that pop up.  If you already have almost half what the balance is, you could put it towards the credit card balance and then you'll only need to pay off like $200 over 6 months or whatever.  And even if you can't completely pay it off in time, being pain free and having to deal with a small credit card balance +interest is a reasonable compromise. \n\nI have good credit, not excellent, and I was able to get approved for a couple grand.  I'd think for younger folks with less credit history getting approved for a few hundred bucks is feasible.  Plus having the card and paying it off on time is great for your credit history!!", "He jumped right into my head, for sure.", "Unexpected Sister Wives.", "A lot of health networks will let you pay with flexible, 0% interest installments.\n\nI have decent enough insurance, but still owed about 3k for outpatient surgery a few years ago.
