I'm so sad for your sister. I hope you and she can pull some funds together and that it will be successful. Good on you for supporting your sis- they certainly won't!", "NTA. Your parents are incredibly selfish and needed to hear it. I sincerely don\u2019t understand why any parent wouldn\u2019t do anything in their power to relieve their child\u2019s pain (regardless of their age) to the best of their ability.

Your parents should be ashamed of themselves. It\u2019s one thing if they truly couldn\u2019t afford to pay for it but the fact that they openly piss away money but when your sister needs something medically they can\u2019t be bothered. I hope you were able to shame them into paying the $450. \n\nI can see a future posts from either parent trying to figure out why none of their kids want anything to do with them or to help them later in life.", "NTA.

You\u2019re a GOAT sibling wise though.", "Your dad should have paid considering your mom is covering insurance costs. But overall you're going overboard by trying to tell people how to spend their money. $450 is manageable for a 19 year old to earn at a job or to take out a small loan on. As she becomes an adult she will have to learn to manage emergencies and plan for unexpected bills. It would be awesome if your parents were able to fund her forever but that's not likely to be the case. Soft yta because while it came from a place of wanting to help your sister, screaming at your parents isn't productive and isn't your place.", "NTA and you are not wrong in this. I suggest you get in touch with relatives and friends to help loan out some money to fund the $450 for her. Or if you can help pay for her, you can do that. Sciatica is serious", "ESH.\n\nYeah, I think your parents should have helped her out.     But it is wild that you think you get to tell your parents how to spend their money.   $450 is not an insurmountable sum for a 19 year old earn.   \nIt\u2019s summer, she should be working full time.   \n\nI\u2019m assuming you paid the $450 since it was so important to you?", "NTA", "Find a really good chiropractor to treat your sister's sciatica.

So your reasoning doesn\u2019t really make any sense.", "Did your sister have the surgery yet?   Does the doctors office offer payment plans?", "Not necessarily. If insurance isn't going to cover it, it doesn't make sense to even do a consultation. You can call your insurance company to see if it's something they will cover before you go for a consultation. \n\nThat said, very often a consultation for a procedure is offered free by the doctor. Perhaps OP can check to see if that is true, or if the doctor offers sliding-scale fees? \n\nNTA, OP, and I hope your sister finds some relief."]}
