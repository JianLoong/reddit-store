Not only this but he was absolutely horrible to my mom in the process and really screwed her over. I was angry with him and went NC with him for 4 years after. \n\nMy grandfather on my dad's side before he passed away told me to try and make amends with my father. As I loved him very much I agreed to try. I slowly tried to build a relationship back with him and things have been ok but strained because trusting him has been hard. I also don't like Brenda. I did try but we have nothing in common. She's a very gossipy person who talks trash about so many people and I'm more interested in world events and science and psychology. I lived nearby until about 3 years ago and made an effort to see them once a month.\n\nI have now moved a 4 hour drive away and can only get up once or twice a year to visit. On one visit a couple years back Brenda started talking about my half sister, saying if she had raised her she wouldn't have had all the problems she did and that my mom was wrong in how she managed her mental illness. Without going into as much detail, my sister has BPD and was very hard to manage in her childhood and after years of trying to get her help and her running away my mom agreed to let her go live with other family as she asked. It was either that or she was going to live in a group home most likely. I snapped at Brenda saying she wasn't there and she has no idea what she was talking about. I was little but I remember all the pain my family was going through and how hard it was for mom to let her go.\n\nSince then every time we have gone out together Brenda refused to talk to me. She won't respond if I say hello, she stares at her phone and talks to my dad as if I'm not there. I asked him to say something about it because it's rude and uncomfortable and he just says he can't tell her what to do and we need to work it out. I told him if that's the case I will only visit with him and not if she's around. He says I'm being dramatic and if Brenda isn't invited he won't come either.  I told him if he won't leave her behind then he won't be seeing me anymore either. I love him but I'm not going to let her disrespect me anymore. He's making me feel like I'm being an AH because I want to see him but I don't want to let her treat me this way.", "created_utc": 1677158697, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/119xmug/aita_for_telling_my_dad_i_wont_go_anywhere_with/", "score": 583, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He loved you both, and because you were both valuable to him, he wanted you to be valuable to each other. It was understandable and well-intentioned, but it was also misguided and unfair. Your father has already shown you that he does not value you. He destroyed your family for sex. He mistreated your mother and made your life infinitely more difficult in the process. He married his affair partner, a woman who denigrates your mother in your presence. Your father refuses to address his wife\u2019s misbehavior because, as always, his comfort is more important than yours. He has never once placed your well-being above his own. He never will. That is not value. That is not family.\n\nYour grandfather loved you. He would want you to be treated with care and consideration. I doubt he would have wanted you to stay in a relationship with a man who had no regard for your feelings or well-being. Perhaps it was too painful for him to admit that his own son was such a man. Regardless, you are the one who has to live with this relationship, not your grandfather. I suggest you live your life based on the other lessons your grandfather taught you - that you are worthy of love, respect, and kindness. Choose your relationships based on those lessons rather than a request he made when he wished, in vain, that his son was a better father.", "Dear Grandad, I tried but I\u2019m done.

It's not like you're there to visit her or want to interact with her, anyway. You're an AH for punishing your father for his wife's behavior (which is actually of benefit to you).\n\nYour father is an AH because he doesn't say anything to his wife about her rudeness.

I would just leave that mess where you found it.", "NTA - you have your boundaries which are healthy. You\u2019re allowed to dictate who\u2019s in your life and who is not. Don\u2019t let people make you feel like an AH for setting boundaries. You will see your dad and he can meet you half way. If he wants to disregard your feelings and make his visits with you unpleasant, why would anyone continue? You\u2019re his daughter, he\u2019s allowed to have a relationship with you that\u2019s just with you and not his wife. If he can\u2019t see that, it\u2019s his problem not yours.
