Not only this but he was absolutely horrible to my mom in the process and really screwed her over. I was angry with him and went NC with him for 4 years after. \n\nMy grandfather on my dad's side before he passed away told me to try and make amends with my father. As I loved him very much I agreed to try. I slowly tried to build a relationship back with him and things have been ok but strained because trusting him has been hard. I also don't like Brenda. I did try but we have nothing in common. She's a very gossipy person who talks trash about so many people and I'm more interested in world events and science and psychology. I lived nearby until about 3 years ago and made an effort to see them once a month.\n\nI have now moved a 4 hour drive away and can only get up once or twice a year to visit. On one visit a couple years back Brenda started talking about my half sister, saying if she had raised her she wouldn't have had all the problems she did and that my mom was wrong in how she managed her mental illness. Without going into as much detail, my sister has BPD and was very hard to manage in her childhood and after years of trying to get her help and her running away my mom agreed to let her go live with other family as she asked. It was either that or she was going to live in a group home most likely. I snapped at Brenda saying she wasn't there and she has no idea what she was talking about. I was little but I remember all the pain my family was going through and how hard it was for mom to let her go.\n\nSince then every time we have gone out together Brenda refused to talk to me. She won't respond if I say hello, she stares at her phone and talks to my dad as if I'm not there. I asked him to say something about it because it's rude and uncomfortable and he just says he can't tell her what to do and we need to work it out. I told him if that's the case I will only visit with him and not if she's around. He says I'm being dramatic and if Brenda isn't invited he won't come either.  I told him if he won't leave her behind then he won't be seeing me anymore either. I love him but I'm not going to let her disrespect me anymore. He's making me feel like I'm being an AH because I want to see him but I don't want to let her treat me this way.\n\nEditing to add: For those asking why dad doesn't come visit me, I live on my mom's property and would never even consider having him here, let alone Brenda.", "created_utc": 1677158697, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/119xmug/aita_for_telling_my_dad_i_wont_go_anywhere_with/", "score": 1340, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He loved you both, and because you were both valuable to him, he wanted you to be valuable to each other. It was understandable and well-intentioned, but it was also misguided and unfair. Your father has already shown you that he does not value you. He destroyed your family for sex. He mistreated your mother and made your life infinitely more difficult in the process. He married his affair partner, a woman who denigrates your mother in your presence.

That is not value. That is not family.\n\nYour grandfather loved you. He would want you to be treated with care and consideration. I doubt he would have wanted you to stay in a relationship with a man who had no regard for your feelings or well-being. Perhaps it was too painful for him to admit that his own son was such a man. Regardless, you are the one who has to live with this relationship, not your grandfather.

Ignore game is a game kids play. She is acting like a child. It is totally understandable that you don\u2019t want to be around her for many reasons. She helped give you trauma. Affairs effect the kids too. Then she is bashing your mom. Which she shouldn\u2019t be doing at all. Also saying stuff about your sister. She is saying if she has raised your sister this and that.
