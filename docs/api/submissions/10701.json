{"id": 10701, "submission_id": "119xmug", "title": "AITA for telling my dad I won't go anywhere with him if his wife is there?", "selftext": "My (38f) parents got divorced about 14 years ago after my father had been having and affair with his current wife Brenda for 5 years. Not only this but he was absolutely horrible to my mom in the process and really screwed her over. I was angry with him and went NC with him for 4 years after. \n\nMy grandfather on my dad's side before he passed away told me to try and make amends with my father. As I loved him very much I agreed to try. I slowly tried to build a relationship back with him and things have been ok but strained because trusting him has been hard. I also don't like Brenda. I did try but we have nothing in common. She's a very gossipy person who talks trash about so many people and I'm more interested in world events and science and psychology. I lived nearby until about 3 years ago and made an effort to see them once a month.\n\nI have now moved a 4 hour drive away and can only get up once or twice a year to visit. On one visit a couple years back Brenda started talking about my half sister, saying if she had raised her she wouldn't have had all the problems she did and that my mom was wrong in how she managed her mental illness. Without going into as much detail, my sister has BPD and was very hard to manage in her childhood and after years of trying to get her help and her running away my mom agreed to let her go live with other family as she asked. It was either that or she was going to live in a group home most likely. I snapped at Brenda saying she wasn't there and she has no idea what she was talking about. I was little but I remember all the pain my family was going through and how hard it was for mom to let her go.\n\nSince then every time we have gone out together Brenda refused to talk to me. She won't respond if I say hello, she stares at her phone and talks to my dad as if I'm not there. I asked him to say something about it because it's rude and uncomfortable and he just says he can't tell her what to do and we need to work it out. I told him if that's the case I will only visit with him and not if she's around. He says I'm being dramatic and if Brenda isn't invited he won't come either.  I told him if he won't leave her behind then he won't be seeing me anymore either. I love him but I'm not going to let her disrespect me anymore. He's making me feel like I'm being an AH because I want to see him but I don't want to let her treat me this way.", "created_utc": 1677158697, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/119xmug/aita_for_telling_my_dad_i_wont_go_anywhere_with/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I also cannot understand why he would not have reprimanded her like a gossipy teenager when she bad-mouthed your own mother in front of you.\n\nI am sad to hear that you will not be having a relationship with your father any more, but until he starts looking at this issue from all sides, it is probably not healthy to be around such a miserable, passive-aggressive, negative person who lacks total empathy, sympathy, common decency, and any sense of what is socially acceptable in the modern world.", "NTA, Brenda seems like a piece of work and your father bows down to it.

I can never see father's current wife as anything other than the woman he cheated on my mother with.", "NTA. This sort of thing happened between me and my father.

Perhaps you can reconnect with your father when he actually gives a damn about you.", "NTA so he can destroy your family with an affair partner and is mad at YOU for standing up for your family after said affair partner talked crap about your family? Does your dad realize he can be grateful you even want to see his face again? He cant talk to the affair partner that she is disrespectful and ignoring you because you were protecting your family? Im sorry but your dad is choosing her over you..again. id think strongly about having such a person in your life. It seems like your dad doesnt care about you at all and prefers his own satisfaction so he wont risk that", "NTA - I don't get your dad's line in the sand.
