Not only this but he was absolutely horrible to my mom in the process and really screwed her over. I was angry with him and went NC with him for 4 years after. \n\nMy grandfather on my dad's side before he passed away told me to try and make amends with my father. As I loved him very much I agreed to try. I slowly tried to build a relationship back with him and things have been ok but strained because trusting him has been hard. I also don't like Brenda. I did try but we have nothing in common. She's a very gossipy person who talks trash about so many people and I'm more interested in world events and science and psychology. I lived nearby until about 3 years ago and made an effort to see them once a month.\n\nI have now moved a 4 hour drive away and can only get up once or twice a year to visit. On one visit a couple years back Brenda started talking about my half sister, saying if she had raised her she wouldn't have had all the problems she did and that my mom was wrong in how she managed her mental illness. Without going into as much detail, my sister has BPD and was very hard to manage in her childhood and after years of trying to get her help and her running away my mom agreed to let her go live with other family as she asked. It was either that or she was going to live in a group home most likely. I snapped at Brenda saying she wasn't there and she has no idea what she was talking about. I was little but I remember all the pain my family was going through and how hard it was for mom to let her go.\n\nSince then every time we have gone out together Brenda refused to talk to me. She won't respond if I say hello, she stares at her phone and talks to my dad as if I'm not there. I asked him to say something about it because it's rude and uncomfortable and he just says he can't tell her what to do and we need to work it out. I told him if that's the case I will only visit with him and not if she's around. He says I'm being dramatic and if Brenda isn't invited he won't come either.  I told him if he won't leave her behind then he won't be seeing me anymore either. I love him but I'm not going to let her disrespect me anymore. He's making me feel like I'm being an AH because I want to see him but I don't want to let her treat me this way.\n\nEditing to add: For those asking why dad doesn't come visit me, I live on my mom's property and would never even consider having him here, let alone Brenda.\n\nEditing to add: thank you for all the kind words and support. I actually cried a bit at some of them. I sat down and wrote a letter to my father. Telling him that I love him but his actions have caused me so much harm. And that by walking away I am choosing not to let his wife make me her victim any longer. That I know all the arguments he has made and will try to make again and I don't want to hear  them.

That is not value. That is not family.\n\nYour grandfather loved you. He would want you to be treated with care and consideration. I doubt he would have wanted you to stay in a relationship with a man who had no regard for your feelings or well-being. Perhaps it was too painful for him to admit that his own son was such a man. Regardless, you are the one who has to live with this relationship, not your grandfather.

Please understand that you don\u2019t owe your time or a relationship of *ANY KIND* to anyone. You do not owe your father anything. \n\nMy sister also has BPD, and we had great parents. Sure, they had their faults but no one can honestly claim that they\u2019re a perfect parent. If they do, then they\u2019re lying. Most parents are just trying to do the best they can with what they\u2019ve got. It doesn\u2019t mean they caused the BPD. My parents didn\u2019t cause it and your mom didn\u2019t cause it. It\u2019s almost like that\u2019s not really the way that BPD and other mental illnesses really work. It\u2019s almost like it\u2019s caused by the lump of fucking membranes in someone\u2019s head not producing the things, or overproducing the things, that a person needs. \n\nPer McLean Hospital, \u201cBPD may be caused by genetics, brain abnormalities, and/or environmental factors.\u201d[https://www.mcleanhospital.org/essential/bpd](https://www.mcleanhospital.org/essential/bpd). \n\nBut according to the John Hopkins Research Center, \u201cMental health experts don't know exactly what causes BPD.\u201d [Borderline Personality Disorder/John Hopkins Medicine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/borderline-personality-disorder)\n\nSo at this point, we have determined that the experts don\u2019t know. They kind of know. They have theories, but they aren\u2019t positive. If the experts don\u2019t know, how is *Brenda* supposed to know? I mean, exactly who is allowed to professionally diagnose someone with, and determine the cause of, a mental illness like BPD? Well according to both the Cleveland Clinic and the National Education Alliance for Borderline Personality Disorder, only psychologists, psychiatrists, and clinical social workers are allowed to diagnose and work with an individual with BPD. \n\nSo, does she have a medical degree? Is she a licensed physician? Is she a psychiatrist or psychologist specializing in mental health? Is she a recognized clinical social worker? Did she ever *RAISE A CHILD WITH BPD*? Probably not. So her opinion counts for, *checks notes*, absolutely nothing, it appears! It seems as if her opinion counts for fuck all, as far as I see. \n\nBrenda has absolutely nothing to contribute when it comes to the topic of your sister\u2019s BPD. She has no experience nor does she have an opinion backed with scientific facts. The fact that you even tried to have a relationship with this woman so that you could mend your relationship with your dad is honestly astonishing to me. \n\nI mean, by all accounts, it would be perfectly reasonable if you didn\u2019t even want a relationship with your father. He cheated on your mother, his ex-wife, he didn\u2019t even attempt to have a reasonable and amicable divorce with the mother of his children, and then he married his affair partner and he\u2019s so narcissistic that he can\u2019t even comprehend the idea of going anywhere with you without the person that was complicit in and helped to destroy a marriage. Because heres the thing, your dad chose to cheat. He chose to break up a marriage and a family. But even if Brenda didn\u2019t know that he was married beforehand, she sure as shit shouldn\u2019t have married a cheater.\n\nBrenda is pitching a fit because you called her out on the fact that she has no idea about what you, your sister, and your mother went through regarding your sister\u2019s BPD. Your mother tried to help and get help for your sister and was unable to. At that point, she chose what she thought was the best and safest option for your sister. Brenda is upset that you wouldn\u2019t let her belittle your mother for doing what she had to and your father is attempting to exert power that he thinks he has and demand that you be around Brenda for the sake of your relationship. That\u2019s all he is doing. This is a power move by your father. If he can get you to be around Brenda, then what else can he get you to do?\n\nNta op, but you need to wipe your hands clean of this mess. You have my permission. You have your moms permission. You have the permission of everyone that matters and understands what you\u2019re going through. Your father will never contribute anything to your life except toxicity and a constant reminder that he would rather have sex than stand up for his children. He didn\u2019t do it then and he won\u2019t do it now.", "Well, and that's why she thinks she *can* talk: the father has always chosen her. She has had no consequences for what she has done. She slept with a married man and then married him after he divorced his wife.

Kudos to you for humoring him but it\u2019s time to admit you were right to cut off your asshole father and his mistress to begin with and leave them behind for good. Your father is not really your father if he cares more about pleasing her than having a relationship with you.", "dont freet. u are not the buttholes here! i wish u have a nice day tho;-)!", "Want to watch me live with me brother", "NTA\nI don't blame you for how you feel about your dad's wife. She seems like a narcissist. I would go LC on your dad and NC with his wife if that's possible. Good luck.", "She acts like you aren't in the room, but you're somehow the dramatic one? NTA", "What she's doing is known as a \"cut direct,\" a type of public snub developed in Regency England as an etiquette penalty reserved for only the most heinous offenses against common decency, because it means that you don't recognize the other person as existing in the world of civilized behavior, where everyone is polite to one another. For example, Miss Manners once suggested that it would be appropriate to use a cut direct if Hitler tried to shake your hand. \n\nSo your dad is not willing to tell Brenda what to do when she's being literally as rude as someone can be without cursing and spitting in your face, but he is willing to tell you what to do, and put the burden on you to make getting together with him less uncomfortable for him? Yeah, he's chosen her over you. NTA. I'm sorry your dad is a dick.", "Is your dad like, a dog leashed to his wife so much that he refuse to see his son if she's not here to NOT PARTICIPATE? \n\nYou owe nothing to no one. As I read your coms, I can see that your mom already lost tragically one battle for her daughter. She saw you fight for a so called dad that doesn't deserved it. You did great by not playing her game because no one know the horror and hard times your mom lived.\n\nI am NC with my dad. They say that NC is harder than death because it's like a 2nd grief, and per experience, we both know that it's true. But your dad chose her. He chose her from the begining. If he want you it's his time to try. He's not in negotiating position. That's called boundaries. And you need them before this tragic clown duo hurts you. Sometimes there's battles you can't win, specially when you're the only one to fight, some relationships are just meant to let go.\n\nDon't worry, it's gonna be okay :) If he want a bond with you, he know your conditions. And if he dont, welp, you'll know that you lost absolutely nothing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA BTW", "NTA. Sadly,  your non contact might be better for your health. I'm sorry.", "NTA. I have zero sympathy for cheaters and their side pieces. Cut them both out.", "Your father thinks you're being dramatic but Brenda isn?\n\nNTA", "yup. she gave it a try, just like she promised her grandfather, but her dad isn't meeting her halfway. she should be able to have one-on-one time with him anyway, even without this drama, but if Brenda's going to act like this then OP definitely shouldn't have to be around her. if dad's going to let this slide, and refuse to meet OP without his terrible wife (sorry but she sounds terrible), then that's not something that can be fixed by OP \"trying.\" tbh it kind of sounds to me like Brenda is deliberately sabotaging the relationship, and OP's dad is allowing it.", "I used to have a very close friend with BPD. I ended up becoming their \u201cFavorite Person\u201d and it was incredibly difficult. I eventually had to leave the situation. BPD is very difficult for the family, friends, and the person with it. Even if you\u2019re a good person/friend/family member and the person with it tries their hardest to be mindful it can still have devistating results. I wish your family and especially your sister good will. It\u2019s tricky. What OPs stepmom said was incredibly insensitive. She has no idea what it\u2019s like to have BPD or manage healthy relationships with someone who has it", "She's already does a lion's share of the work, do you really think Brenda is driving 4 hours to see OP with her dad? Her dad is the same crappy person he was when he cheated on her mom and he's already told her he's not choosing her.", ":( \\*huuuuuug\\*", "She's already won. She's severed OP's relationship with her father. The only question is whether OP is required to sit there politely and watch her continue to do it over and over again.", "Exactly.", "Thats just all wrong. North Carolina BBQ is vinegar based. \n\nSource - lived in NC for over a decade and made my own bbq sauces", "NTA. He was a selfish asshole then, and he\u2019s a selfish asshole now. I think you could do better with a surrogate father figure. At least they would care how you feel.", "NTA. Your dad chose his affair partner. Move on.", "NTA You\u2019re better off going nc with him. No father is better than a father who will hurt you repeatedly. He wasn\u2019t there for you when you were younger, and he\u2019s not here for you now. A real father would not allow his daughter to be treated poorly.", "NTA\n\nDon't set yourself on fire to keep other people who don't appreciate you warm.", "NTA.

Seems like that reason has evolved but it's still valid all the same.", "NTA you never have to tolerate rude people", "Why are you trying so hard when he doesn\u2019t care? I get that it\u2019s for your grandad but I would say at this point you tried. And it\u2019s your dad who doesn\u2019t care about the relationship.\n\nNTA. Build relationships with people who treat you better.", "NTA. Your father doesn\u2019t care that Brenda insulted you; he can\u2019t be bothered. He chose her over his family years ago and nothing has changed. You\u2019ve tried but it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s all that willing. Go live your life, stick to your guns.", "NTA back to NC  with your sperm donor", "NTA. But I don't think you should let this incident drive you back into full NC with your dad.  I've been estranged from my birth mother and getting back in a relationship is really difficult. I don't think it will ever be just a smooth thing where I don't feel like I'm working really hard to let things go and just be cordial. I have my reasons for trying (my adult son asked me, and said it will make it easier on my nieces, nephews and brother and sister). At this point in my life (late 50s F) I want to let go of anger and focus on things that are my priorities, not someone else's bad behavior. \n\nDo you feel like you want to do something similar? If you have your own reasons to do so, meet up with your father and his wife and she doesn't speak to you, oh well. When she figures out you don't care, she'll drop it. If she confronts you about snapping at you, you could chose to say something like Brenda, did you ever really think I was going to be ok with you disrespecting my mother and sister? You shouldn't have brought up your opinions in front of me, It's not your business. \n\nThe trick with dealing with people like Brenda is to take away their power by being calm, and not letting them involve you in the drama. If you decide it is worth it to you to have a relationship (even a strained one) with your dad, you can make it work. Just imagine Brenda as a 2 year old child who's babbling you do not understand. Smile, nod and move on.", "NTA  you tried dad made a choice walk away", "NTA. I know missing your father by going NC is hard, but sometimes it can be a wake up call for them. I went NC with my father at 19 for 2 years, and we have since reconciled because he changed and worked to respect my boundaries. Perhaps you could express to him how if he can not respect this boundary, he will no longer be allowed into your life again, then stick to it.", "I would upvote you 1,000 times if I could.

Not having a loving father is very difficult.  Do you have other people that can be a father figure in your life?  Having a toxic person in your life is bad for your mental health, let alone a parent/step parent.", "No father figure but I'm lucky to have an amazing mother and wonderful friends.", "Ok and if it was you and you want to go no contact, then go for it. But it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s someone else\u2019s life. All this armchair life advice of \u201cstop talking to your dad NOW\u201d is horrible, if they feel they need to go no contact then they will but it would be shitty if they did because in the moment they were influenced by random era on Reddit who thought they knew really anything about the situation", "NTA - It probably was painful for your grandfather to see you and your father not talking. But that doesn't mean your father would cooperate and that is 100% not your fault, its his. There is no reason why he couldn't just have a lunch or dinner with just you. And he should drive the 4hrs to see you as well. I'm sorry you are having to re-visit and go through this. Don't put yourself through this again. Know that even if your father behaves this way that you are more than good enough and honestly dont need him in your life.", "So he thinks YOU are being dramatic while \u2018Brenda\u2019 makes a big show of ignoring you?

It is so noble of you to try to re-engage with your father!  It's a two-way street, though, and it seems like neither he nor his wife are all that committed to making amends.

I used to think North Carolina was an absolute craaaazzyyyy state before the little lightbulb clicked and I finally got what nc meant", "Yeah thats gaslighting. He's not acting like a victim. He IS a victim to her bad behavior. Such a sleeze.", "Its a jab designed to get under your skin. Don't let it unnerve you. You know he does this now.  Just say calmly \" that may be possible but it doesn't change xyz.  Remember that when you confront someone to do it calmly without attacking them personally, raising your voixe, or getting upset.
