Long story short my DIL has severe morning sickness also known as Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) and I\u2019m tasked with her caregiving.It is a horrible sickness to have and I feel extremely hurt for my DIL. When DIL was 3 months along my son asked if me and my husband could take her in and care for her because he felt disrupted at work and couldn\u2019t sleep well. \n\nI immediately obliged and was happy to help because DIL\u2019s parents are overseas. Unfortunately my DIL has mild paranoia that stemmed from her HG and thus sometimes feels unsafe and unfamiliar in our house and often shouts to see my son or get really angry at times. I don\u2019t fault her for any of these things because I know she can\u2019t help it. I accompany my DIL to her appointments and stay by her side throughout when  she is having severe nausea I  also sleep beside her for the night because I\u2019m worried sick if she\u2019d feel dizzy and fall  while getting up in the night for a pee. We have spoken to her gynae and my DIL is now on anti-psychotics which does make her feel better but she still has bouts of anxiety and asks for my son often. Right now my son visits every fridays and leaves on Sunday mornings.\n\nI have asked my son to call her often but he gets into arguments with me saying he doesn\u2019t have time even though he finishes work latest by 6. Calling her everyday would definitely help my DIL a lot. Besides that I really think having a familiar face would help so  three days ago I asked my son if DIL\u2019s parents could move over from their home country for the time being and stay over at his house. My son says that would be an inconvenience and he\u2019d have to pay for their living expenses, so I countered that I would chip in a bit. I was also absolutely shocked to find out that my son and DIL minimised her HG issue and was lying to her parents that everything was still \u201cmanageable\u201d. My son said it was not happening and that he would not be able to function properly with everyone in the house. I got very frustrated and called DIL\u2019s parents and told them the reality of the situation and they were very disappointed but also concerned and eager to help out. \n\nI confronted my son after the call  and he is extremely angry with me and his father. We both think that he needs to be more involved and empathetic because once the baby arrives it\u2019s only going to be worse and we are getting old as well and can\u2019t be there for every step of the way. My husband assured me that I made the right decision but my son is pretty bothered by it and thinks I\u2019m being selfish and is just using an excuse to not take care of DIL even though Ive been here for her more than him. DIL\u2019s parents would be arriving in a week so I\u2019m extremely grateful for that but I still feel guilty if this was the right way to go about it\n\n***Thank you to everyone who has responded , I feel overwhelmed about how much more worse this situation could be, as a mother both to my son and dil I feel deeply ashamed and worried about how callously my son behaved. My plan is to definitely sit him down and talk to him and mention some issues that people have brought up including how he plans to take care of the baby if dil is recovering and still mentally unwell , and whether his actions are just because of stress or if he is really neglectful. If he has become neglectful I\u2019d support my dil in choosing what\u2019s best for her. My daughter in law would always have my unhindered support regardless and she\u2019d be staying with me and well cared for till her parents arrive and afterwards as well if they need a break. I need to reflect and question my son on why he is behaving this way and resolve it as necessary.

My word. YOU are NTA. You and your husband sound pretty great for helping her so much. Your son on the other hand is a major AH. An insult to trees. Sorry. But wow on every level is he a selfish individual.", "NTA. Quite honestly, your DIL should move back with her parents. Your son is behaving like a worthless asshole and I don\u2019t see him treating his child any better than he\u2019s treating his pregnant wife.", "NTA - Youre not dumping her out on the street, youre trying to get her the help she needs. How could he be away from his wife this much if he trult loved her? Thank you for looking out for her, even if its the hard descsion you have to make.", "NTA. Your son is using you, and abandoning his wife and responsibilities. You're doing the right thing. Its time for him to be a man. Don't enable his childish behavior anymore.", "NTA your son shouldn\u2019t have had a child if he couldn\u2019t even call his wife after work, while you\u2019re doing EVERYTHING for her. He needs to grow up.", "NTA Your son kicked his wife out of the house during her pregnancy because of a medical issue and only visits her on the weekends?! He needs to get his head out of his ass because we all know new parents don't get sleep or quiet time. This is nothing but the disruptions starting a few months early.\n\nYou've been great to the point of it being unfair to you. At most, he should be looking for help during his work day so DIL isn't alone but that's it.", "First of all, it is EXTREMELY kind of you to allow your DIL to stay with you and that you\u2019re caring for her through these medical issues. This is no small undertaking. Frankly, your son ITA. It sounds like he\u2019s completely pushing off his problems onto you. I don\u2019t want to jump to conclusions because some people are seriously bad at handling stress, but I do question his commitment to your DIL being that he won\u2019t even call her while she\u2019s carrying his baby and in a literal health crisis. This is alarming at best, a bad sign that he\u2019s not very committed at worst. \n\nI personally never would have allowed my DIL to stay with me without requiring my child to stay in the house with her more often than Friday-Sunday. Maybe it would be hard for him to come more often, but life is hard. He married her, he decided to have a baby with her, and he needs to grow up and learn how to care for his spouse \u201cin sickness and in health\u201d. \n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d give your son a big reality check. Require that he either comes more often (at least 4 nights/week) AND Facetimes his wife EVERY DAY, or you will not be able to care for her anymore. This isn\u2019t being cruel to her, you don\u2019t even need to follow through (I\u2019m not suggesting you kick a pregnant, ill person out onto the street), but make him think that you will so he learns he can\u2019t just throw his problems at someone else just because he\u2019s \u201cnot sleeping well\u201d. I fear for you that you will be caring for your DIL and the baby LONG after the baby comes if you allow your son to do what he\u2019s doing without requiring him to put in adequate effort. \n\nGood luck to you, OP. You sound like a saint for taking someone in who needs 24/7 care. But, you need to take care of yourself, and like you said, you\u2019re getting older and probably not as equipped to handle sleepless nights and massive stress as your (presumably) young son. Take care of yourself. I hope your DIL and baby stay safe and your DIL\u2019s health improves. And I hope, for your sake, and DIL/baby\u2019s sake, that your son grows up.", "I cannot believe this son of yours, OP. If this is how he copes with his wife\u2019s pregnancy, what\u2019s going to happen when baby is here?\n\nNTA, but who is going to be there for this poor woman??", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t see why your son would be angry that you\u2019re trying to help your DIL out with her situation, which is really also his situation.", "NTA\n\nYour son is too busy to call his wife, who is carrying her child and has HG as well as a host of other mental health issues? Not only that, but he has no responsibility for her day to day care because he dumped her in your lap?  Are you kidding me?  His wife feels scared, abandoned, physically ill, anxious, dizzy, nauseous, and overwhelmed and he can't make time to facetime her for 10 minutes each day? This is absolute bs. \n\n\nObviously he minimized your DILs condition to her parents because A. He doesn't really deal with any of it; B. he doesn't seem to care or think you or she needs help and C. He knows that her parents would freak out if they knew the truth.\n\nWhy are you letting your son get away with this behavior? If she needed help, you could have stayed with her and him so he didn't get a free pass on helping his wife. \n\nI am scared about how he would treat her if she was living in the house alone with him. Because he seems incapable of caring about his wife. If you can't do it anymore, get her family involved because you can't let him be her sole caretaker.", "Are YOU an AH? Not in my eyes. Your son, however, is totally being an AH.\n\nI say this as a disabled veteran with a gf/caregiver. BEING a caregiver, 24/7, takes its toll on a person. The worse the situation, the more of a toll it takes. It has on mine over the years, so much so, that when we got her some counseling, her counselor told her to leave me for her own sake/sanity/health. \n\nIt sounds like your son, however, is and has dodged his responsibility to take care of his wife and is falling back on work as his excuse. It's great you are helping out, but, you shouldn't be having to do everything while he pops in a for a day or two a week. \n\nYou are 100% correct that once the baby arrives, the situation will get infinitely worse. DIL's condition AND a new baby to take care of? WHILE your son ducks his own obligation? I'm glad you tried to confront him, but, you seriously need to do more with him about it. Or the situation will get WAY out of hand for you and your husband.", "He didn\u2019t want his own wife in her own house and shipped her off to you. Then when more help is on the way he doesn\u2019t want her and her parents in the house. His excuses and reasoning are crap. He\u2019s treating everyone like crap. That\u2019s a dead giveaway. I\u2019m not sure he isn\u2019t running two separate lives here. There\u2019s something big going on. Your son is at the center of it. NTA. You owed it to your DIL and her parents to make the call. Stay involved. Keep your eyes open. Especially keep talking with her parents.", "NTA. Your son sounds like he\u2019s making excuses to not help care for his wife and I wonder if he even wants to be married to her/having a child with her\n\nYou have been wonderful and so kind but you are right. You won\u2019t always be around to help and he needs to be there for her. \n\nIt\u2019s crazy he kicked her out of her home and is putting so much of this work on you.", "NTA \n\nYour son is selfish and entitled. He doesn't even have one grain of sympathy for his wife. I'm speechless.", "NTA. Nothing but empathy for you and your daughter-in-law because that sounds like an absolute nightmare. You're very kind person for taking all of this on. It must be so tiring and frightening and emotionally exhausting to boot, and it doesn't sound like anyone is showing you the gratitude you deserve. I can't imagine how frustrating that feels.\n\nThe way your son is acting is out of control. Very self-centered and thoughtless. He got your daughter-in-law pregnant and by virtue of the situation he should expect to have to deal with all of the ups and downs and curveballs that go along with everything. It is after all his wife and child  He was mature enough to have the sex and mature enough to decide to make a family so he needs to be mature enough to see things through. The responsibility is his and his alone to support your wife and while it would be great if her parents came and all four of you have the capacity to take on some of the struggle it's unreal that he thinks what he's doing now is appropriate.", "NTA. Clearly your son thinks the whole universe needs to shift for his comfort alone. What is wrong with him? When the baby is crying every night at 3 am is he going to ship his wife and kid to you so he's not distracted from his work? Seriously, what is wrong with him? Has he always been selfish, entitled, and completely lacking in compassion for others?", "NTA. Your son is EXTREMELY selfish", "NTA and.... based off the details I'm thinking you guys are of middle eastern or indian heritage, maybe even asian. Something like that. Because that's some behavior that I see in my culture alot.\n\nI hate to say this to you ma'am but you raised a crappy son. HE should be with her, SHE should be at home with him, not pawned off to his parents. Can't sleep because of her sickness? Go sleep in the livingroom. Hell buy a second bed if you need to, temporarily.\n\nIf you REALLY have to have her stay with you guys then he should at the very least be calling her or something.\n\nI'm going to say it like it is here, he's a crappy son and an even crappier husband to her. Who WOULDN'T want to be talking to their wife every day when they aren't together in person? I don't know a single married couple whose happily married that aren't talking at least once a day if they're not home together.\n\nI know this sucks to read and I know it may even piss you off but he needs to grow up, and take care of this girl. Or, if divorce is an acceptable option within the families, he needs to let her go because he clearly isn't grown up enough to be a good husband or father. Imagine what he might do to your grandchild, 'Mom the baby cries too much can it live with you until it learns to stop crying as much?'.", "NTA \n\nYour son sounds like a jerk, and it is beyond kind of you that your biggest issue with him is about not calling his own wife as opposed the number of other things he seems to not be doing in this situation. \n\nYou've gone way above and beyond here and you've more than earned the right to put your foot down.", "You're NTA, but your son's a prick.", "NTA. Your son on the other hand needs to step-up and take responsibility for his actions.", "NTA. \n\nYour son essentially abandoned his wife into your care and truthfully, will likely abandon the baby in the same way. Not physically, but emotionally and mentally. It might be time to have a discussion with your DIL's parents about her moving out and moving in with them. Your son is a huge AH who is just full of excuses.", "NTA. I'm so sorry you are going through this, plus learning that your son is a weak man who is ill equipped for fatherhood.\n\nIt's ideal for your DIL's parents to come and help and I'm sure they will all appreciate your action.", "NTA\n\n\nYour son is more concerned about his sleep and not having to deal with his sick wife.  He won't even call her.  Doesn't want her parents involved.\n\n\nHonestly it sounds like your son is messed up, is he having other women there?  Does he have a drinking or drug problem?  Trying to figure out why he has so much of an issue having her parents know what is happening and having them stay at their house taking care of her?\n\n\nWhat does he intend to do when the baby comes?\n\n\nThank you for being so good to your DIL.", "NTA - Your son needs to step up to the plate. What\u2019s he going to do when the baby is born? Probably rely on you to help care for the child, too. He\u2019s wrong to call you selfish. He\u2019s the one that sounds selfish. He can\u2019t even make the time to call DIL more often? What does he do for a living?\n\nFrankly, it doesn\u2019t make his behavior less shitty no matter what the job is. Maybe DIL would benefit from having her family with her. She definitely sounds like she needs more support than what she\u2019s getting from your son. Sounds like you\u2019re trying your best to help her but at the end of it, SHE and HE made a baby. Not you. If they don\u2019t start working together on this, will they ever?", "NTA.  You are very loving and generous.  I think you did the right thing to call your DIL\u2019s parents.\n\nINFO:  Is your husband willing to sit your son down for a hard talk about supporting his wife and future child?", "NTA.\n\nYour son is, though. Why can\u2019t he even be bothered to *call* his severely ill wife and only see her on weekends? Why is the brunt of this falling on you and your husband? It\u2019s unfair to both of you.", "Holy guacamole! You are NTA and mil of the year I\u2019m thinking. Your son is an entitled piece of work. I\u2019m actually scared for your dil and future grand baby. His behavior is not normal. He can\u2019t be bothered to call his wife daily who is sick and carrying his child. Lies to her parents about how she is? Holy crap this is a scary situation for your dil.", "What's DIL?", "What is up with your son?! \n\nYou are most definitely not the asshole. Not at all. Your son is. \n\nBeing a caregiver is a lot of work for anyone, especially if you are doing it 24 hours a day. No matter what age you are. Of course you need help. To me it seems obvious that you only want what is best for your DIL and that this isn\u2019t some scheme to not have to take care of her. \n\nWhat I don\u2019t get is why your son doesn\u2019t seem to care about his wife (and child) as much as you do? He should have moved in with you and your husband at the same time as his wife did so that he too could help take care of her.\n\nIf I were pregnant and got hyperemesis gravidarium and had to go and live with my in-laws to be taken care of 24/7 my husband would also stay there. Even if it meant that he had to sleep on the couch. He would want to spend every minute taking care of us. And he would most definitely stay in touch during the day when he is at work. \n\nI also think it\u2019s weird that your DIL\u2019s parents didn\u2019t know the truth about her condition? Why wouldn\u2019t they tell them? If I were that sick I would want my mom there. \n\nAnd in this situation - WHO THE HELL CARES ABOUT WHAT YOUR SON THINKS IS AN INCONVENIENCE?! What the fuck is wrong with him.", "You raised a worthless son. I\u2019m sorry. \n\nYou are an angel for taking care of DIL like you have been. \nMaybe your sons girlfriend doesn\u2019t know his wife is pregnant. That, or he\u2019s a monster. Those are the only 2 reasons I can fathom why he behaves like this. \n\nGood luck. NTA", "NTA\n\nWhen your son calls you selfish, he\u2019s projecting. Where is his love for his wife? His care? His basic respect? He kicked his pregnant wife out of their house because of her pregnancy-related illness. He\u2019s treating her like an inconvenience instead of a human, let alone the supposed love of his life.\n\nThank you for caring about and for your DIL.", "ESH except your DIL. Your son is doing a terrible job as a husband & future father. He should at least talk to his wife everyday, & it\u2019s concerning that he doesn\u2019t want to. However, you shouldn\u2019t have called DIL\u2019s parents. You should have followed her wishes in what to tell or not tell them. Most of the time when adults are not candid with their parents about their personal situations, they have a very good reason.", "YTA\n\nFor allowing your son to treat his pregnant wife like this.", "YTA - Your DIL sounds like a hostage in your home.

On the contrary, you sound like one of the best MILs I have ever heard of.   \nYour son might need a bit of a wake-up call however. He does not seem to serious about his wife or her pregnancy... this is concerning behavior that will likely only get worse once the baby comes", "Nta but your son is asshole", "NTA. Your DIL needs to start making arrangements for when this baby is born and he chooses to not be involved because it\u2019s stressful and won\u2019t let him sleep.", "Jesus, NTA. This baby is gonna get dumped on you too. Your son has just completely ditched his responsibilities onto you and your husband", "You are NTA, no chance at all of being one! \nI had HG in both my first and second pregnancies. It was a whole lot of trauma for me and more so when my second ended in miscarriage.\nMy MIL is just like you, she took me to hospital, cleaned our house, fed us and everything in between. I\u2019m incredibly lucky to have her in my life and I\u2019m sure your DIL would feel the same. \nFrom a HG mum, Thankyou for caring for her when she can\u2019t care for herself.

You're basically punishing her for what your son is (not) doing. You told her private medical information to people who she didn't want to know.\n\nYour son is also a bit of an AH, but primarily you for punishing the wrong person and breaking her trust.\n\nYou don't even trust her ability to stay safe at night on her own, but you're expecting her to now be on her own for almost all day... So you're a hypocrite too", "ESH, mostly your son is an asshole to neglect his very ill wife. You are for calling her parents and didn't talk about it with her. I love my parents but the way they raised me are causing me anxiety attacks when I see them often. It was  way worse in pregnancy and after delivery. There might be other reasons why they kept them on information diet. You should talk to your DIL if she is missing her parents and want them to be around first.", "It unfortunately is, I feel ashamed of my son if I knew the reason why he was outsourcing my DIL was because he was lazy and unbothered I\u2019d have never agreed he told me she kept bothering him and that there was no one to look after which is why I stepped up. I love my DIL and I worry for her all the same, I just feel horrible at my sons lack of responsibility", "If he can't even call her every day because he is so busy, he absolutely will not help his wife through this.  Let alone be a good father after the pregnancy.\n\nI would be so scared for her safety, on lots of levels. Pregnant women are at a huge risk for domestic violence, and the neglect he has shown her so far doesn't make me feel any better about him being her sole caretaker during this time. \n\nHer parents should be there to help her.", "He was most likely outsourcing her to me now that I know the truth, he told me he couldn\u2019t work , he was losing sleep and she was calling him all the time at work which made me sympathetic and that\u2019s why I took her in fearing for her well-being. My son wasn\u2019t always like this , but regardless me and my husband would try to talk sense to him till it gets into his head.", "Exactly. Because it won't be easier when the baby comes along. At this rate, OP will have the baby and the SIL staying with her.", "This!!!! OP sounds like a saint. I worry the son is going to be an awful father based on how he\u2019s treating his pregnant wife :(", "He is not angry that I\u2019m helping out he is angry because now there are going to be DILs parents in the house looking after her once they arrive and he doesn\u2019t like that and also he feels annoyed because he\u2019d have to be responsible for their day to day expenses like food and such. Which I don\u2019t understand because I offered to help but he is still not willing to compromise , makes my head burn being in the middle of all this", "I think he is angry because he knows he is doing something shitty and her parents will absolutely point it out to them. He likes how it is now. He can do anything during the week, and only has to be involved on the weekends. He doesn't even make time to call during the week. He likes the setup and doesn't want it to change.", "We are Sri Lankans except me and my husband are second generation and we grew up here , and yes looking after daughter in laws and family in general  is a custom we follow by default. I understand what you mean , my son used to really help out my DIL before this ordeal so the hopeful part of me says maybe he is just stressed and in a lot of pressure and anger and avoidance is the way he deals with issues. \n\nThat made me uncomfortable as well, but as I\u2019ve said he told me he was losing sleep even with being in another room because he was a light sleeper and could hear her getting up and that she was frequently calling him at work, so I didn\u2019t want to question his intentions further and just was more worried for my DIL. Once I took her In, he became more complacent with the calls and the meeting or taking her out and it makes me feel sad for my DIL, because I remember how my husband was my pillar of strength during pregnancy and my son unfortunately is not living up to the same standards. \n\nI will talk with him more and help him figure out and if worse comes to worse and he refuses to change I\u2019d support my daughter in law and grandchild with whatever option she chooses.", "When he first said it to me , I felt a bit iffy but he said it in a way that he was almost helpless , only now do I realise that he just wanted to have his own time and space while someone else took care of my sick DIL. My son drinks socially and as far as I know there\u2019s no drugs and I also am not sure about infidelity but I pray to god it\u2019s not like that and if it is I\u2019ll feel so betrayed by his actions. He doesn\u2019t like to waste more money because if DILs parents come along he\u2019d have to get their groceries and also the main issue is that he mentioned DIL was keeping him awake at night with the frequent getting up even after they changed rooms , so I think it\u2019s an amalgamation of all those reasons and being lazy. \n\nExactly my point , if he is already struggling now I\u2019m highly suspicious on whether he plans to task the baby\u2019s caregiving to us as well, we obviously don\u2019t mind and are glad to help but I don\u2019t want to burden my DIL anymore all because my son won\u2019t do his part.", "Thank you dear, my husband and I have already talked to him a lot of times, once his dad got a little more stricter in tone and even then he\u2019d take what we said seriously for a day or two then go back to his old habits of not picking up calls or bringing her out for one to one company etc. Regardless  we are still going to talk to him and get him help if he needs it and be more stricter if needed, and if worse comes to worse , I\u2019d tell him his relationship is at stake and that if my dil decided to leave the marriage I\u2019d support her wholeheartedly,", "Daughter-in-law.", "Daughter-in-law", "I have a very strong feeling dil would be happy to have her mom with her. I'm suspicious that her husband is controlling the information. He doesn't want his in-laws to come. He threw the fit, not his wife. It was the perfect thing to do.", "I see your point, but I take the call as the last action of someone who's desperate. OP has been asking them for help with this situation and didn't get it. The alternative would be to kick the DIL out, but I'm sure that asking the other parents for help seemed the kinder of the two options.", "I get that and appreciate your opinion but in my defence I\u2019d rather dil be angry with me for the time being than see her get worse,  my dil probably didn\u2019t disclose cause she was afraid they worry crazy and my son obviously because he himself confessed that he didn\u2019t want them staying over. DIL loves her parents so there\u2019s no bad blood there and both of them would definitely be able to help her out and provide that familiarity that I couldn\u2019t.", "I\u2019m sorry you feel that way but I respect your opinion. I follow my DIL because she is exhausted most of the times and weak, and doesn\u2019t have much energy to drive herself to appointments so I do the driving and also she gets dizzy at times, that\u2019s a risk I would not like to take. Two of DILs friends came to visit , but they are busy too and i wouldn\u2019t expect them to handle DIL day to day duties. She is not held hostage , we bring DIL out when she feels well but most of the times she just wants to rest.", "I mean I'm not sure if OP is TA in this situation, but it is really weird to sleep next to her, to talk to her gynecologist, and to contact her parents. It almost reads like DIL isn't an adult but is more like a child/teen bride.", "My son doesn\u2019t pick up when she calls ( or when I call him because she wanted to talk to him) after work. I concur it\u2019s my fault for disclosing her private information to her parents but I\u2019d rather that than she feels worried and anxious and not have someone familiar to guide her. I do the best I can for her and no she would definitely not be left alone , I\u2019d care for her till her parents arrive and settle in and only then would she be moved. I am not punishing her by any means I would never leave her alone , as mentioned I\u2019d be with her till her parents arrive", "Is this a new kind of development for him or something he's always been like. Your DIL is lucky to have you on her side. And also forgot to say it's good you told her parents in my opinion. They should know how she's doing I would think since it has escalated quite a bit it sounds.", "He has horribly neglected his wife during this time. He complained that his pregnant wife who is incredibly sick is a bother. Do you honestly believe that if he is her sole caregiver that he would actually commit to helping her? Or do you think his utter disregard, lack of compassion, and frustration will cause him to be more neglectful than he already is? \n\nMy biggest fear is that neglect will become even worse. Pregnant women are incredibly vulnerable, and your DIL sounds like she is suffering and needs someone to love her, care for her, and help her. Not someone who will call her a bother, refuse to talk to her for days on end, and feel no responsibility or accountability.", "Not to mention the baby once it is born. I'm afraid to even think about what he'll do if he gets annoyed because the baby cries during the night and therefore disrupts his sleep...", "Pregnancy is hard on everyone. Theres a small chance hes facing the fact that he doesnt feel as strongly for DIL or is even maybe not ready to have a kid/having seconds thoughts.\n\nYou need to have a serious conversation with him about what he really wants, because if he doesnt want her apart of his life, shed probably be better off on her own (as sad as that is). Hes avoiding responsibility- but with someone like you who really cares to hold him accountable he cant run away for ever. Good luck!! You sound like a truly wonderful woman, and im sorry you have to go through all of this and play damage control.", "Me too, it\u2019s honestly a really sad situation for all parties involved. I know that caring for someone 24/7 isn\u2019t easy, but OP\u2019s son has completely removed himself from his wife and unborn child. Hopefully he shapes up, but based on OP\u2019s story, I have serious doubts", "So basically, he wants to keep his money and his empty house", "I don\u2019t want to fear-monger, but have you considered that your son might be having an affair?", "By this logic, is he responsible for DIL's every day expenses while she is at your house?", "I figured something like that. I come from a Hindu family and unfortunately it IS something I see entirely too often within our culture. \n\nMy concern here however is if he reacts poorly when angry and cant keep his emotions in check when hes under pressure or stressed, what will happen when the baby is born? That is 18 years commitment at minimum. Add to that, in our culture birth control isnt very commonly used between husband and wife, your DIL will get pregnant again possibly and that adds even more years. All these years he'll endure and they wont be easy years. They will be full of stress and pressure.\n\nHe needs to step up more. I understand its difficult but this marriage happened, whether arranged or by choice, and with it came these responsibilities. Perhaps have your husband talk to him. Your husband can show him. And talk to your husband in a way that will influence the outcome. \"Dear, I am worried. I remember when I was pregnant you gave me so much strength and support. I worry our son isn't leading by that same example\". \n\nNow of course your son might need some help. Maybe counseling. To help understand ways to manage the emotions. You seem like a progressive woman so I hope you understand my suggestion is only to help him be a better man. Not to call him a lunatic.\n\nBut ultimately he cannot continue this marriage like this. Your DIL is scared. In a new country. And unfamiliar surroundings. She needs him. \n\nShes lucky she has a mother in law like you. I've seen many MIL who treat their sons like gold and dont take into account the DIL. Im happy to see this", "Yea anytime he tries to guilt you about your responsibilities has a mother/MIL/grandmother remind him of the responsibilities he took in sickness and in health as a husband and that he needs to worry about his responsibilities as a father.\n\nI'm afraid she will be at risk for PPD when the baby comes and I really hope for her sake and yours that he changes.  It sucks getting woken up at night but she can't help it.  He chooses to not even comfort her with a phone call, to me it sounds like he isn't concerned about her health or wellbeing at all.  What is he doing at home after work that he can't come by for a visit or call?  You should have your husband show up there one night after work to see what's really going on, and maybe he needs to have a conversation face to face with him about his responsibilities.", "I guarantee that, based on the post and your comments, your son plans to have you care for the baby and your DIL. He has shown no responsibility so far. He can't even call her every day ffs.\n\nDo they have a nursery set up yet?", "I think he doesn't want her parents to know what is going on because they would flip out.\n\nI honestly cannot wrap my head around dropping his pregnant and sick wife at his mom's house for the duration of her pregnancy because she is a \"bother\". And then not calling for days on end when he knows she needs his support.\n\nNormally I don't believe in giving medical information out without consent. But it sounds like OP is beyond overwhelmed, DIL is in bad shape mentally and physically, and her husband refuses to do anything to help.\n\nIdk what else OP could have done.", "You made the right decision. If her mental health has deteriorated to the point that she's on antipsychotics, she needs the support, and she'll have the familiarity of her own home (while I'm sure you've made her as comfortable as possible at your house, sometimes people just need to lie in their own bed).\n\nI don't know why your son has become such an...irresponsible person (I want to say something worse, but he's still your son, so I'll refrain), but it sounds like he simply doesn't want her parents there because he'll have to act like a caring human being. Don't blame yourself, though. Sometimes people grow into terrible adults, regardless of how well they were raised. I hope for everyone's sake that he gets his act together.", "Is she OK with all of this? Like, has she asked you to do it? Is she really OK with you sleeping by her...I think I'd be pretty freaked out if someone volunteered to do that. How old is she...?", "Why can't she rest in her own home? You could visit once a week to drive her to appointments. You haven't mentioned what your DIL actually wants", "I wonder if OP believes the DIL might be s*icid*al.", "You're still a MASSIVE Ahole for telling people that you KNOW she didn't want to know about her medical condition", "Nope, he and my DIL as far as I know were and are in love, my son always wanted to be a father so I have no idea about the sudden change. I don\u2019t if it\u2019s stress from my DILs hg , if it\u2019s work stress or if it\u2019s pressure of everything. I just don\u2019t know and he doesn\u2019t open up as well or if he does it ends up being an argument. The issue is they weren\u2019t even aware of how severe the hg issue was , my son mainly downplayed it because he didn\u2019t want them concerned. I really feel that it was selfish to do that on his part they could have came sooner", "I wouldn't put it past him to have his wife AND baby stay living with his parents.", "That had never seemed like a possibility but I just wish it\u2019s not , it would crush me and destroy my DIL, I\u2019d ask my son about this as well although I know for sure it\u2019s not going to go down well.", "He pays us back for the medical and appointment fees, but everything else is paid by us including food ,toiletries , pregnancy needs like shaped pillows or looser clothing.", "Oh my god, I was thinking the same. That this sounds like an Indian family. Turns out Sri Lankan, close. But yeah, the son dropping off his pregnant wife at his parents, made me think that. It's a very common practice, or atleast used to be. My mother stayed with her parents during her pregnancies. The idea was the woman would be surrounded by mother, aunts, sisters, older experienced people who can cater to every need of hers and she can just relax. Usually in the marriage husband would be the breadwinner with the wife doing all the household chores. But during pregnancy, she takes a break from all that and just sits back with everyone spoiling her. \n\nBut what the son is doing here is basically feeling entitled  to delegate his responsibilities to his very accommodating parents. He seems to have checked out of his husbandly duties and doesn't really seem bothered that his wife is struggling.He is going for the option that will cause him the least inconvenience irrespective of what it does to others, even though it's his wife n his baby.The guy is such a disappointment yet I am not very surprised.Its a culture that revolves around the oh so precious SON.", "Yes , especially during severe nausea she calls me to help rub her back and during vomiting she mentioned finding it comforting that someone is there, Dil was the one who suggested I sleep beside her cause she needs the company and it also helps with her anxiety. She is 26.", "DIL wants company ideally from my son but because he has put her in our care DIL still wants someone by her side , I mentioned elsewhere here that she gets frequent nausea and finds it comforting when someone there to rub her back or massage her head afterwards, she also gets anxious and we help to talk her down from her overthinking and comfort her. I don\u2019t exert any authority over my DIL , I treat her like another daughter and if there are things she\u2019s uncomfortable with she tells me and I respect her boundaries.", "You actually have absolutely no idea about how severe HG can be.", "I shudder to think of what kind of father he'll be. If this is his new 'style', he'll only want to partake in the fun parts and will leave all the hassle to your poor DIL. And he will try to hide from the world how unsupportive he really is. \n\nNot even calling during the week! That's less than minimal effort! \n\nIf I were your DIL, I would be reconsidering the entire relationship, if this is what he's like \"in sickness and in health\". It's fair that he can't look after her while working. HG is no joke, so getting her settled in with you was a good plan, but not calling her to see how she's doing is so shitty. Not to mention, how she's doing has real implications for hiw the baby is doing, so as a father he's not impressing anyone either.\n\nYou did the right thing to get her parents involved. Of course they'll want to help their daughter. \n\nI am so sorry your child has turned out like this. He clearly didn't inherit your capacity for good and compassionate decisions.", "Was it your DIL\u2019s choice to not tell her parents about her condition or was it your sons? \n\nTo me it seems really weird that \u201che\u2019s always wanted to be a father\u201d and the second his wife gets sick he just outsource her care to you. \nHe should want to care for his wife by himself. He should not care about what\u2019s inconvenient for him or even focus on himself, his only concern should be his wife\u2019s and in extension his baby\u2019s health. \n\nIf my husband were to behave anywhere near this he would not be my husband anymore.", "I'm sorry y'all are going through this on all accounts and I apologize for my initial reaction as well. I can imagine it's all quite the shock for y'all. Could very well be the stress of all of it and not knowing how to cope other than shut everything down like this but goodness. Hopefully he comes to his senses or finds someone to talk to and sorts it all out. Keep being there for DIL however you think she needs it. Best of luck", "How convenient for him. So he does exactly nothing? And has exactly zero time?\n\nSomething deeper is going on here. Whether it's infidelity or abuse, something really bad is going on here.", "I am gravely worried too , I need to sit down and chat with him about how he plans to allocate care for the baby in case DIL is still sick and recovering. I\u2019m praying it\u2019s just the stress of it all and not a permanent value or attitude change. \n\nHe always makes excuses and I don\u2019t understand why , because he gets off at latest by 6 and mostly buys his meals out , so I don\u2019t get why he does not have the extra time to call my DIL. \nEven when I call him to talk , he cuts the calls or does not pick up at all. \n\nIt\u2019s a harsh reality to accept that my dil might change her mind regarding my son but I\u2019d completely understand if she did as you mentioned. I\u2019m hoping my son does change for the better and this is just him being stressed and projecting. Thank you, I do feel guilty for worrying her parents but I felt it would be better that they know and help her out , having her parents around would alleviate a lot of stress. It\u2019s ok, maybe right now things are just difficult but I hope it changes and my son becomes a more supportive husband and father in the long run.", "In my opinion, I don't think he wants to be a father.

I didn\u2019t get morning sickness but suffered from daily bouts of fainting (only happens while pregnant), was super tired all the time and had really bad sacroiliac pain which made it hard to walk. My fianc\u00e9 was always more concerned about how he felt (he\u2019s tired or his back hurts and he needs a massage) and didn\u2019t help prepare for baby or even around the house. When my son arrived he didn\u2019t help at all at night. Whenever I brought up how I was suffering from a lack or sleep & overall support, he\u2019d get mad at me and say his sleep is more important, despite the fact he took paternity leave. He spent his entire leave doing a diy project instead of helping me. His mom came to stay with us for a couple weeks and she made several comments to him about how this wasn\u2019t okay but he\u2019d argue with her too. I actually told her If he kept this up, we wouldn\u2019t be making it down the aisle. My 11yr old (different \u201cdad\u201d) is more helpful and I don\u2019t have to ask for help ir tell him what to do, he just knows and does it (even though he says he doesn\u2019t like having a sibling).

I really hope this can be resolved.", "OP, as others have said, you are NTA, but your son sure appears to be - at first look. \n\nHowever, I do want to share our experience. First pregnancy, I had horrendous HG, my parents lived 6 hours away and worked full time, and husbands parents lived overseas. My husband was self-employed and had \u2018some\u2019 flexibility to be at home, but was often at work from 8am to 6pm - he had to pay our mortgage, all our bills and all the extra medical stuff (I was employed but was on sick leave from 16 weeks and all my paid sick leave ran out). The HG didn\u2019t go away until the c-section was performed (when I instantly felt better). \n\nHusband would medicate me in the morning (zofran literally saved my life), go to work, stop at the supermarket on the way home to get cola and new crackers for me to try to keep down. He\u2019d come home, attempt to bathe and/or feed me, clean all the spew bags, buckets and the rest of our apartment, change the bed, set me up with the \u2018spew pillow\u2019 on the floor next to the toilet (which was where I could sleep best), try to eat, shower himself etc and do all the laundry. Every day, for 180 days. \n\nI was completely focussed on the baby, and just managed to hang in there mentally (i.e. not become suicidal, although I did threaten the OB to bring the c-section forward). With the benefit of hindsight, that pregnancy really fucked my husband up.  He\u2019s since told me he thought I was going to die, how helpless he felt and how overwhelmed and under-supported he felt. We both ended up with PTSD and years of counselling, and he didn\u2019t want us to have any more children (although we eventually did).\n\nNow, we\u2019re both well-educated and my mother is actually a obstetrics nurse practitioner. But in hindsight, we did NOT communicate very well to anyone how sick I was.  In part I think this was because my OB didn\u2019t seem to realise how sick I was.  We didn\u2019t know anyone our age who had kids and had no idea how not normal our situation was. I was too sick to advocate for myself and my husband was completely stressed and just *didn\u2019t know what to do*. \n\nI\u2019ve written all this because, while your son may indeed be a complete dick, he may also be totally overwhelmed, scared and unable to cope with HIS feelings. He asked you to help his wife, which is actually great, but he might not know how to ask for help for his feelings and fears (or even recognise that they are important). If he\u2019s not been like this before, he deserves an open mind.  Try looking for ante-natal depression resources for dad (or even peri/post-natal depression for dads resources).

Like serious conversations need to be had because this is concerning behavior.\n\n What's he going to do after the baby is born and she is still recovering (My mom was able to come and help us after the baby was born because I definitely didn't bounce back immediately and husband had caregiver fatigue by that point)? Babies don't care if they \"inconvenience\" you. And so far, he seems to dump inconvenient things off on you.", "NTA - First of all, you sound like a wonderful mother and an equally wonderful MIL! Thank you so much for not being one of those mothers who think their child can do no wrong. You see the problems and have gone above and beyond in loving and caring for your DIL and son. You did exactly what needed to be done. Her parents really need to know that the situation is so dire, especially since they want to help and her husband can\u2019t/won\u2019t properly care for her. She is clearly very sick, both physically and mentally, and I am certain she will be so relieved to have her parents with her during this overwhelming period. \n\nI know you know that your son is behaving quite selfishly. He needs to think of how terrible this is for his wife as well and what would be best for her and the baby. It also is not right for him to make you the only option for help when they have others to rely on too. He could have made this much simpler by just calling her several days per week. It sounds like a video call every other day could help a lot, and I don\u2019t understand why he wouldn\u2019t want to at least talk to her everyday. \n\nI hope you can have a good talk with your son and figure out what the problem is that is causing him to act so out-of-character. He might need to see a therapist to work through whatever the issue is. I would think it\u2019s likely that he has become so anxious about being a father that it has caused him to pull away. Or maybe he feels guilty for her illness and regrets getting her pregnant, because she\u2019s sick from being pregnant. Guilt and fear are powerful motivators that could explain why he is avoiding calling. A professional could definitely find out and help way more than a random woman\u2019s theories on Reddit though. Haha\n\nPlease just remember, even though this situation is so difficult, that you have done nothing wrong! Good luck!", "I would have loved to have a mother-in-law like you.", "I would have been so grateful to have a MIL like you when I had HG. Unfortunately she was a monster and dismissed my HG as acting for attention because she was pregnant 4x and just loooved her pregnancies. She even convinced my husband that I was acting weak and demanding attention. There is nothing worse than having HG! It is a living f**k\u2019n hell ( I am not saying this lightly). There is an article stating that women with HG feel 7-9x sicker than people undergoing the big \u201cc\u201d treatment. Your DIL is so lucky to have you support her and have her back! She is also lucky have have you sit your son down and talk about the realities of HG, and his negligence. Sounds as if she will need you going forward. HG is hard, being a new mother is hard, having no support is probably the worst. So you are definitely not the AH for being caring for someone is such great medical need as your DIL! My husband is better now, but it took so long for him to rise up to the expectations of being a good father and husband.I hope your son will become more empathetic soon.", "NTA. If my husband is away for one night I hear from him several times. It sounds to me like your husband is cheating on his wife. That would explain the lying to his in laws.

At a time when he needs to step up he is totally throwing in the towel.", "NTA - However, I think you are not being honest enought with yourself about how your son treats his pregnant wife. He shows an extreme lack of concern and interest in her well being.

Your son need to grow up and rearrange his work to suit his family, not the other way. It is as if he does not understand how much work it is going to take to raise the kid.

Basically, the real issues of raising a baby have not started. Is your son going to help or get stuck at work?", "NTA but you have to stop this. NOW. Things will not get better on their own.

She is lucky to have you.", "You are NTA but your son is a major AH\n\nI also had this condition and unless you have been through it, it\u2019s literally too awful for people to understand. You feel like a shell of a human being.\n\nMy spouse was there for me as much as could be. Spent lunch breaks to check on me. Carried me to the tub to bathe me when I was too weak to walk.

As you have decided, have a word with him and please let him know in no uncertain terms that what he's doing is not working and that a child is a huge responsibility. If he's going to absent himself when a newborn has needs and the mother of his child needs an assist, your DIL is more likely to leave him than tolerate it.\n\n#NTA\n\nI hope this resolves itself soon and that you're able to enjoy your grandchild in a far less conflicted environment!", "Lots of love for you. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA at ALL. I had severe HG with my first pregnancy and I have moderate HG with this pregnancy (2nd) and I could not imagine if my husband acted like your son has been. How unsupportive and horrible! We are only able to have more than one child because my parents live close by (within 30 minutes and work 5 minutes away) and they come and help me all the time while my husband works. When husband is not working, he is parenting our toddler and trying to help out with household things. I am beyond thankful for all my parents do for me and my family AND I\u2019m thankful that my husband is generally sympathetic and understanding. As you know, it is HARD to be a caregiver for someone sick months at a time and unable to do much of anything, even caring for themselves. But having more hands on deck to help out makes the load lighter. DIL\u2019s family should absolutely know she\u2019s suffering and I\u2019m really glad they\u2019re willing to help out. Your son needs a wake up call with how debilitating this condition is and needs to figure out how to not make everything about HIS comfort. What\u2019s he going to do with a newborn disrupting his sleep? SMH. Anyways, good job OP. You sound like a dream MIL any of us would be thankful for. You did the right thing.", "What is hg?", "You are NTA, but your son. Most parents have to juggle work, other responsibilities and a baby. He can\u2019t just leave you guys to take care of his pregnant spouse and perhaps baby. I worked full time with 3 hour sleep most nights for a year as a single mom of 2 babies.

I'm sure it's also very hard for you to see how your son is treating his wife, your DIL.\n\nIt seems to me like he just...didn't realize how hard all this would really be. That pregnancy is no joke, and it can be really hard on some women, and sometimes pregnant women need a lot of care and support.\n\nHe's burying himself in his work and refusing to contact DIL during the week because he doesn't want to deal with her, or he doesn't know how, so he pushed her onto you and your husband. Which, thank God you two are there for DIL, who knows what would've happened if you weren't. \n\nStill, this is the moment for him to step up and be a husband and a father. He needs to pour more of his time and energy into her because she is unwell and vulnerable. She's always asking for him because she needs him right now. But he doesn't seem to care. He doesn't want to make the effort. That's deeply worrying, because if this is how he's going to be when she needs him the most, their relationship may not work out.\n\nI also think it's VERY concerning that he attempted to hide the severity of his wife's condition from her parents. She's struggling, yes, but she's on meds for her HG and anxiety, and she's being cared for, so there was no reason for her parents to not know what's going on. Did DIL also not want her parents to know, or did your son convince her to minimize her condition? I hope this doesn't become a habit for them.\n\nYou seem like a very loving and compassionate person who wants the best for your family. You did the right thing. While there's nothing wrong with asking family for help, it isn't fair for your son to have you take care of his wife for him and he only pays attention to her on the weekends. Him having a job isn't an excuse for him to emotionally neglect his wife.
