My husband was divorced from my stepdaughter's mom. She was 8 when my husband and I became serious and my son was still a baby. Not long after my stepdaughter's mom died. My husband and I had talked about marrying before she died and we delayed it for a couple of years to allow my stepdaughter time to grieve and adjust to the changes in her life. This was with the help of therapy, of course. We knew a child who lost someone so close would need extra help.\n\nNow my stepdaughter is 20, my son is 12 and our children together are 7, 6 and 4.\n\nSo what happened here is my stepdaughter and her boyfriend recently moved into a house together. She asked for help setting up their dining room and we all went over to help her. Her house was covered in photos. The landing had them, living room, kitchen, etc. There was not a single photo of her siblings in the house, or me, but it was not seeing one of the kids that led to this. She had her parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, her cousins, and friends. But there was no sign of the kids anywhere. All of the photos with her dad were older ones, from before we met. My 12 year old, 7 and 6 year old's noticed because they were excited to look around her house. I couldn't help but notice because her boyfriend had so many of his siblings and because there were some, what felt like deliberate choices, to make sure she used photos that didn't contain her siblings. Including extended family photos from years ago with my husband's side that were taken before her dad and I met. And we know she has photos with her siblings.\n\nI always knew she wasn't super crazy about her siblings. I always hoped as she got older she would feel love for them. But it feels like she doesn't think of them as family or as special enough to be included. The three kids who noticed were hurt. My husband tried to assure them it was likely an oversight on her part and he called her the next day to ask. She said she had only wanted photos with people she considered family and she didn't consider us family.\n\nWe were all invited to her housewarming party. But the kids did not want to go. My husband and ILs were shocked and said they had to go of course. I argued that they didn't and I told him I would stay home with them. They argued back to me that the kids needed to be. I said they did not need to be there and I wouldn't force them to go when they already feel hurt. My husband and ILs think I'm unreasonable. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678890439, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ry0bu/aita_for_telling_my_husband_and_ils_that_our/", "score": 1846, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No more seeing her, no presents, no well wishes, nothing. Just be cordial for the sake of your husband in situations you can't avoid seeing her.

Maybe even have separate Christmases and any other festivities you guys celebrate. While she may be entitled to feel the way she feels, it doesn't change the fact that she was deliberately hurtful. Protect your children at all costs. I suggest attending couples counseling with your husband because this is going to repeat itself a lot in the future.

Your children's feelings are just as valid.", "I don\u2019t really have a judgment. But i will say my only brother is ten years older than me. We have the same parents but lived totally different lives. We talk, but we don\u2019t know eachother very well. I don\u2019t have pics of him up at my house, I doubt he has any of me. It doesn\u2019t offend me. Just seems like there could be bigger things to be mad about.", "Forget all the adults, it is OP\u2019s responsibility to do what is best for the minor children! Being around people that don\u2019t care for them isn\u2019t healthy.", "Oh, yeah, childish pettiness and snarky comebacks totally fix relationships!", ">Stepdaughter made a point of demonstrating her utter disregard for her half-siblings (and OP), and doubled down by explaining that they \"aren't family\".\n\nAnd on the one hand, I hate when people try and force kids into a relationship with people they don't want to, but also, whatever resentment step daughter feels towards these kids isn't due to anything that's their fault. It's pretty shitty to be 20 and be so overtly exclusionary to children who presumably look up to her and love her like a sister.", "Consequences may even dictate future holidays and family celebrations. It's not like SD can always ignore her half siblings or step mother. If SD is going to set the tone,  one party will have to either fold and capitulate the bullshit,  or bith parties will have to refuse interaction,  which will either cut off SD from the rest of the family,  or OP and her kids.", "Yup, and since we both know you can't force her to hang up a photo for the children's sake,  it's better to keep the status quo and to eliminate the potential harm in the future by keeping the kids away from her.  She's an adult,  and allowed to love who she wants,  but she can't expect any help or interactions from you or the kids going forward since she won't show them or you the slightest affection/kindness/acknowledgement. You made the absolutely right decision for all parties involved regardless of how your husband and ILS feel about it.", "They probably were only mildly upset about it and could have easily been reassured with some solid parenting. Instead you decided to twist the knife in the wound and actually create real exclusion. They'll feel a lot more unwanted by being kept away from her than from experiencing some of the complexities of having a sister who lost her mother.", "I\u2019m wondering if this was the case, and he then took the liberty of bringing OP and the other children along. I don\u2019t think the stepdaughter is the villain so many comments are making her out to be.", "She might have just asked them to go help so they'd see they were left out of the pictures.", "Not if the step mom is the one that usually buys the presents and she\u2019s worried her dad won\u2019t get her one on his own ?         \nThat does happen a lot in marriages", "Which is exactly why she would say his wife and her kids, she doesn't acknowledge them as her siblings at all.", "point me to where exactly it is said that the SD said anything at all like that to the kids?", "For me I completely understand the dad being in denial. The in-laws? I don't understand what they're thinking here and they suck for trying to force children to go to a family event when it's been clearly communicated that those kids are not family to stepsister nor welcomed there.\n\nBut those kids grew up thinking that they have a sister, a family member that's *always* been in their life, thought they were loved and a family unit, to then only to find out that person doesn't give a fuck about you? Hell naw, protect those kids and protect your peace.\nCut her loose and honor her wish, she is no longer a part of your family.", "I\u2019ve never received a gift for our household from one person of a couple, much less 2 gifts, one from one person and another from the other half of a couple. I\u2019m American- this is the \u201cnorm\u201d", "She said the older 3 noticed, so those aged 6+.\n\n4yo aren\u2019t toddlers.", "My 2 and 5 yr old nephews always play with the fridge magnets I have of their kindergarten photos and want to look at the pictures on my wall - which include images of them. Don't pretend to know every kid just because you used to be a kid.", "Actually I think it was deliberate.\n\nWhether she likes it or not, she\u2019s been a part of that family for 12 years. Since OP was surprised there were no pictures of the whole family together, it assumes they did things that would invite family pictures that she would be a part of. She specifically chose older pictures (from when she was a kid!) that did not include any of her step family.", "My mistake, I misread. But the kids did notice & were hurt, which is why her dad called.", "My mistake, I misread, she told her father, because apparently the kids noticed & were upset by the fact that they weren\u2019t represented along with other family photos.", "But only 12yo is a step sibling. The others are half siblings. Unless she felt extremely neglected like she was replaced, they should still be family regardless of the age gap. I have a sister 8 years older than me, and a brother 8 years younger. We are all very close even though there's a gap. My sister was 16 when my brother was born and even though he has no memory of ever living in the same house as her, she always went out of her way to form a sibling bond. From everything OP is saying- delaying the wedding, providing therapy- they did everything they could to make her included, plus her parents were already divorced when mom died. NTA.", "She didn't say that directly to them. She was asked, and then she answered the question. \n\nShe wasn't cruel.", "ergo, she had specifically not said anything of the sort anywhere that the kids could have heard it, indicating that she had infact been trying not to hurt them and is simply not willing to pretend to care about them more than she does. That isnt cruel, and the complete lack of any other mention of any incidents from SD childhood or teenage years indicate that she probably hasnt been cruelt to the kids while she was living with them either. She has done everything that could be reasonably expected of her while she was being forced to live with people that she would never have chosen to, and now that she has enough independence to start curating who she has in her life shes doing that in the least confrontational way possible.\n\nThe Kids have a right to be upset, but that doesn't mean that they were wronged in anyway, life is upsetting sometimes and the older ones at the least should already know this.\n\nObviously OP shouldnt take the kids, and ILs especialy are being A Hs for butting in. But the shear number of people in this comment section trying to make SD out to be this fucking disney villain who likes hurting kids is fucking ridiculous. And that's not even touching on the sheer vindictive glee with which they are making up scenarios where SD will obviously have to come crawling back and OP will slam the door in her face.", "But, they're her step-mother's kids, and she doesn't like her. Those were your siblings from the same parents. I'm certain the family revolved around her kids, not OP as the odd one out. She didn't grow up with the 12-year-old either.", "Sorry, I read it as only the 12 year old was her step mother's kid.  The other 3 are her half siblings with her step mother and her dad. OP says \"son was from my previous marriage, and then we have 3 children together.\" To hear that a sibling that you lived with and you share 1 biological parent with doesn't even see you as family is pretty hurtful.  She's only 20 not 30, so she must have lived with the little ones for a few years and was there for their birth."]}
