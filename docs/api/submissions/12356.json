My husband was divorced from my stepdaughter's mom. She was 8 when my husband and I became serious and my son was still a baby. Not long after my stepdaughter's mom died. My husband and I had talked about marrying before she died and we delayed it for a couple of years to allow my stepdaughter time to grieve and adjust to the changes in her life. This was with the help of therapy, of course. We knew a child who lost someone so close would need extra help.\n\nNow my stepdaughter is 20, my son is 12 and our children together are 7, 6 and 4.\n\nSo what happened here is my stepdaughter and her boyfriend recently moved into a house together. She asked for help setting up their dining room and we all went over to help her. Her house was covered in photos. The landing had them, living room, kitchen, etc. There was not a single photo of her siblings in the house, or me, but it was not seeing one of the kids that led to this. She had her parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, her cousins, and friends. But there was no sign of the kids anywhere. All of the photos with her dad were older ones, from before we met. My 12 year old, 7 and 6 year old's noticed because they were excited to look around her house. I couldn't help but notice because her boyfriend had so many of his siblings and because there were some, what felt like deliberate choices, to make sure she used photos that didn't contain her siblings. Including extended family photos from years ago with my husband's side that were taken before her dad and I met. And we know she has photos with her siblings.\n\nI always knew she wasn't super crazy about her siblings. I always hoped as she got older she would feel love for them. But it feels like she doesn't think of them as family or as special enough to be included. The three kids who noticed were hurt. My husband tried to assure them it was likely an oversight on her part and he called her the next day to ask. She said she had only wanted photos with people she considered family and she didn't consider us family.\n\nWe were all invited to her housewarming party. But the kids did not want to go. My husband and ILs were shocked and said they had to go of course. I argued that they didn't and I told him I would stay home with them. They argued back to me that the kids needed to be. I said they did not need to be there and I wouldn't force them to go when they already feel hurt. My husband and ILs think I'm unreasonable. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678890439, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ry0bu/aita_for_telling_my_husband_and_ils_that_our/", "score": 271, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's kinda one for getting butt-hurt because SD is ruining her fantasy of Happy Family though", "NTA\n\nWhy should they be forced to go to a party of a family member who doesn't even consider them family?", "She already explained in the OP that he was divorced from the stepdaughter\u2019s mom.", "Yeah but she has photos of plenty of people and was explicit that they aren't family. The last bit's the kicker. I agree with the NAH as without more info I have no idea what their relationship was previously but all are entitled to their feelings.", "I\u2019m one of four and non of us have pictures of the others displayed in our houses. I don\u2019t find it odd or insulting that she doesn\u2019t have them up.", "It being a gift-grab makes no sense; since her dad is still going, she\u2019s getting the same amount of presents if her stepmom and half-siblings go or not.", "Well even that one is technically her half sibling legally as well since the husband adopted him because he came into his life when he was still a baby", "Not considering someone family and not having a photo of them isn't cruel. She's entitled to love whomever she wants and display that in her home.", "I'm sure the Dad is heartbroken too and probably has his head in the sand. No way he doesn't want all his kids to feel like siblings.", "I wouldn't treat her like family anymore; her father can go alone to visit and her father can go to her on Christmas and other holidays. I wouldn't subject my children to her presence. The only part of your family that is hers now is her father. I hope her father is good at keeping in touch, buying presents, etc.", "That part doesn't actually bother me. Two of my sisters (half and step) have one other brother.  I do not have a relationship with him, apart from shared parentage,  so I do not count him in my sibling set, nor does he claim to have three sisters. Sometimes families are just like that.", "My thoughts exactly. Feels like OP was looking for something to get worked up about.", "It literally says in the OP that they delayed their marriage plans when SD\u2019s mom died and that they put her into therapy. \n\nAnd the 4 year old wasn\u2019t upset, the 3 older kids (6, 7 and 12) were. I have kids that are similar ages and they would def be capable of noticing the same situation and being upset. \n\nNTA OP. You need to have a chat with your DH about his expectations going forward regarding the relationship between you and SD.", "... I mean, some couples give a joint gift, and some do not.\n\nMy family, usually each person brings a little something. Even when we were kids, we'd bring a small gift.", "Someone can feel what they do,  but that doesn't mean their actions can't be cruel.", "Probably also true, but wouldn\u2019t really explain the rest of the family unless maybe they\u2019re trying to protect his feelings.", "Agreed, and with that logic, if step daughter doesn't consider them family, then there's no reason they should put her first in any capacity nor treat her like family.", "Except these 3 kids are biologically related to her. And she grew up with them. The kid have been in her life since she was 8. They lived together. She can not feel like they are her siblings. But they are.", "That\u2019s not the social norm and there\u2019s no reason to believe she would expect that rather than it simply being a nice bonus if it happened.\n\nEDIT: You can block me, but you can\u2019t refute that we\u2019re both American and that\u2019s *not* the norm in our larger culture.", "Cruelty implies a desire to hurt someone.   \n\n\nThe daughter seems open and calm about not accepting them. \n\nIt's the Dad and IL's that are trying to force the kids to go. \n\nWere the \"kids\" going to help set up a dinning room set? No. The parents brought the kids.   \n\n\nIf the daughters decorating is as intentional as people think - it's because she's signaled to Dad MANY MANY TIMES and he is STILL forcing the kids on her.   \n\n\nGood for the daughter for resisting. DAD is hurting these kids, not the daughter.   \n\n\nSurely her feelings are NOT new.", "Okay. That has nothing to do with whether or not OP or anyone else  is an AH, though. I'm not in their family dynamics.  I don't know if the younger kids got treated differently. I don't know if OP is a reliable narrator regarding their relationship, or the girl's dynamics with her father. Sometimes biological relationships have very little to do with familial bonds. Or are you very new to this sub and unfamiliar with how frequently people break contact with their Bios?", "OP, this is going to be harsh, but don't ever lift a finger for her anymore. No more seeing her, no presents, no well wishes, nothing. Just be cordial for the sake of your husband in situations you can't avoid seeing her. If she wants anything, she can initiate but I would tread lightly. Don't put yourself or the children in such a hurtful situation again. If your husband wants to see her, he can go on his own. Maybe even have separate Christmases and any other festivities you guys celebrate. While she may be entitled to feel the way she feels, it doesn't change the fact that she was deliberately hurtful. Protect your children at all costs. I suggest attending couples counseling with your husband because this is going to repeat itself a lot in the future. There's no way the kids would want to see her at their birthdays or anything, so address this now with him. And also do therapy with your kids and help validate their pain because your husband and ILs will not at this moment. NTA", "Oh *do* tell me what the social norms are where I live. \n\nOr where OP lives.\n\nSince your experience obviously invalidates mine...", "A parent being oblivious in a blended family should not be a surprise to anyone on Reddit.", "So,  where you live, children  of 7, 6 and 4 bringing presents to a housewarming party? Sure.", "...provided by the parents to give to the other person, yes, sometimes children would also participate in such a thing.", "at about the age of 7 I was expected to start buying christmas and birthday gifts for every member of my family, with my own money. It was meant to teach me budgeting and the responsibility of gift giving.", "I would say that is an extremely rare situation.\n\nAre you arguing that the step sister invited the 4 year old solely in hopes that they will get an additional gift from the child that will be of value to her and not like a finger painting?"]}
