My husband was divorced from my stepdaughter's mom. She was 8 when my husband and I became serious and my son was still a baby. Not long after my stepdaughter's mom died. My husband and I had talked about marrying before she died and we delayed it for a couple of years to allow my stepdaughter time to grieve and adjust to the changes in her life. This was with the help of therapy, of course. We knew a child who lost someone so close would need extra help.\n\nNow my stepdaughter is 20, my son is 12 and our children together are 7, 6 and 4.\n\nSo what happened here is my stepdaughter and her boyfriend recently moved into a house together. She asked for help setting up their dining room and we all went over to help her. Her house was covered in photos. The landing had them, living room, kitchen, etc. There was not a single photo of her siblings in the house, or me, but it was not seeing one of the kids that led to this. She had her parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, her cousins, and friends. But there was no sign of the kids anywhere. All of the photos with her dad were older ones, from before we met. My 12 year old, 7 and 6 year old's noticed because they were excited to look around her house. I couldn't help but notice because her boyfriend had so many of his siblings and because there were some, what felt like deliberate choices, to make sure she used photos that didn't contain her siblings. Including extended family photos from years ago with my husband's side that were taken before her dad and I met. And we know she has photos with her siblings.\n\nI always knew she wasn't super crazy about her siblings. I always hoped as she got older she would feel love for them. But it feels like she doesn't think of them as family or as special enough to be included. The three kids who noticed were hurt. My husband tried to assure them it was likely an oversight on her part and he called her the next day to ask. She said she had only wanted photos with people she considered family and she didn't consider us family.\n\nWe were all invited to her housewarming party. But the kids did not want to go. My husband and ILs were shocked and said they had to go of course. I argued that they didn't and I told him I would stay home with them. They argued back to me that the kids needed to be. I said they did not need to be there and I wouldn't force them to go when they already feel hurt. My husband and ILs think I'm unreasonable. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678890439, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ry0bu/aita_for_telling_my_husband_and_ils_that_our/", "score": 613, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd be willing to bet that OP has always pushed the whole 'we're one big family now' to the point that the girl dug her heels in and refused to accept the other children as anything other than 'half-brother/sister' - the children of her father and HIS wife - instead of 'real' siblings.  Exhibit A being that she does have pictures of HER family, including HER mom and dad, but none of OP or her kids.  \n\nOp is NTA for staying away from the party, nor for keeping her children away.

She's entitled to love whomever she wants and display that in her home.", "I'm sure the Dad is heartbroken too and probably has his head in the sand. No way he doesn't want all his kids to feel like siblings.", "I wouldn't treat her like family anymore; her father can go alone to visit and her father can go to her on Christmas and other holidays. I wouldn't subject my children to her presence. The only part of your family that is hers now is her father. I hope her father is good at keeping in touch, buying presents, etc.", "That part doesn't actually bother me. Two of my sisters (half and step) have one other brother.  I do not have a relationship with him, apart from shared parentage,  so I do not count him in my sibling set, nor does he claim to have three sisters.

And she grew up with them. The kid have been in her life since she was 8. They lived together. She can not feel like they are her siblings. But they are.", "That\u2019s not the social norm and there\u2019s no reason to believe she would expect that rather than it simply being a nice bonus if it happened.\n\nEDIT: You can block me, but you can\u2019t refute that we\u2019re both American and that\u2019s *not* the norm in our larger culture.", "Cruelty implies a desire to hurt someone.   \n\n\nThe daughter seems open and calm about not accepting them. \n\nIt's the Dad and IL's that are trying to force the kids to go. \n\nWere the \"kids\" going to help set up a dinning room set? No. The parents brought the kids.   \n\n\nIf the daughters decorating is as intentional as people think - it's because she's signaled to Dad MANY MANY TIMES and he is STILL forcing the kids on her.   \n\n\nGood for the daughter for resisting.

I'm not in their family dynamics.  I don't know if the younger kids got treated differently. I don't know if OP is a reliable narrator regarding their relationship, or the girl's dynamics with her father. Sometimes biological relationships have very little to do with familial bonds. Or are you very new to this sub and unfamiliar with how frequently people break contact with their Bios?", "OP, this is going to be harsh, but don't ever lift a finger for her anymore. No more seeing her, no presents, no well wishes, nothing. Just be cordial for the sake of your husband in situations you can't avoid seeing her. If she wants anything, she can initiate but I would tread lightly. Don't put yourself or the children in such a hurtful situation again. If your husband wants to see her, he can go on his own. Maybe even have separate Christmases and any other festivities you guys celebrate. While she may be entitled to feel the way she feels, it doesn't change the fact that she was deliberately hurtful. Protect your children at all costs. I suggest attending couples counseling with your husband because this is going to repeat itself a lot in the future. There's no way the kids would want to see her at their birthdays or anything, so address this now with him. And also do therapy with your kids and help validate their pain because your husband and ILs will not at this moment.

If step daughter wants you all there, she needs to reach out on her own but even though, you have no obligation to go.\n\nNTA and stand firm. Don't allow your children to be hurt by their sibling.", "NAH for this instance, but I do think you need to consider how this looks going forward for your family. I\u2019m assuming your stepdaughter has always been polite to you and your children since you don\u2019t mention any prior instances. While hurtful, I don\u2019t think she should be required to hang photos of people in her home that she doesn\u2019t want up. She didn\u2019t say anything about it until your husband asked. \n\nSkipping this event to spare your children\u2019s feelings is a short term solution. How will you handle events going forward if nothing has changed?  If you don\u2019t attend any events, do you expect to be invited to the big ones ? (graduations/weddings/ etc. ) I guess the big question is how involved does your husband want to be in his daughter\u2019s life going forward and are you okay with this part of his life being separate from you and your children. I think you only become TA if you start limiting your husbands time with his daughter.", "Nah. Step daughter isn\u2019t an ah for not having pictures of you all.

But you and the kids do not have to go either.", "NTA for not making them go, but I have a feeling you are for other reasons.  I wonder, did the kids notice on their own or did you encourage them noticing by pointing out different pictures until they noticed that they weren\u2019t in any?  Most kids aren\u2019t that obsessed with looking at every single photo in a home, especially all three kids.   That feels like you made a game if it or something which was messed up on your part since you would be directly responsible for hurting your kids.  She is allowed to put whatever photos she wants in her house.  It also sounds like you pushed your kids on her.  There is a 13 year difference in the age between her and the oldest and 16 with the youngest.  Of course they wouldn\u2019t be close.  She also had the pleasure all these years of seeing your kids grow up with both parents while she was missing her mother.  That can be really hard on a kid.  It throws her mother\u2019s absence in her face at every birthday and holiday they have, and every event she has such as prom and graduation, even dress shopping for prom, if she did that.", "NTA. Why keep trying to force that relationship? She\u2019s already made up her mind.", "NTA. Now that you know how she feels, you and your children can stay away from her.
