{"id": 12356, "submission_id": "11ry0bu", "title": "AITA for telling my husband and ILs that our children do not need to attend their older sister's housewarming party?", "selftext": "My husband and I have three biological children together, he adopted my child from a prior relationship and I am a stepmother to his adult child. My husband was divorced from my stepdaughter's mom. She was 8 when my husband and I became serious and my son was still a baby. Not long after my stepdaughter's mom died. My husband and I had talked about marrying before she died and we delayed it for a couple of years to allow my stepdaughter time to grieve and adjust to the changes in her life. This was with the help of therapy, of course. We knew a child who lost someone so close would need extra help.\n\nNow my stepdaughter is 20, my son is 12 and our children together are 7, 6 and 4.\n\nSo what happened here is my stepdaughter and her boyfriend recently moved into a house together. She asked for help setting up their dining room and we all went over to help her. Her house was covered in photos. The landing had them, living room, kitchen, etc. There was not a single photo of her siblings in the house, or me, but it was not seeing one of the kids that led to this. She had her parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, her cousins, and friends. But there was no sign of the kids anywhere. All of the photos with her dad were older ones, from before we met. My 12 year old, 7 and 6 year old's noticed because they were excited to look around her house. I couldn't help but notice because her boyfriend had so many of his siblings and because there were some, what felt like deliberate choices, to make sure she used photos that didn't contain her siblings. Including extended family photos from years ago with my husband's side that were taken before her dad and I met. And we know she has photos with her siblings.\n\nI always knew she wasn't super crazy about her siblings. I always hoped as she got older she would feel love for them. But it feels like she doesn't think of them as family or as special enough to be included. The three kids who noticed were hurt. My husband tried to assure them it was likely an oversight on her part and he called her the next day to ask. She said she had only wanted photos with people she considered family and she didn't consider us family.\n\nWe were all invited to her housewarming party. But the kids did not want to go. My husband and ILs were shocked and said they had to go of course. I argued that they didn't and I told him I would stay home with them. They argued back to me that the kids needed to be. I said they did not need to be there and I wouldn't force them to go when they already feel hurt. My husband and ILs think I'm unreasonable. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678890439, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ry0bu/aita_for_telling_my_husband_and_ils_that_our/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your SD had every right to decorate her home how she sees fit, but she should also understand that the result of those choices could mean some people feel unwelcome there.  \n\nHer choices and the consequences of them are perfectly understandable.

OP and her father had 3 children in rather quick succession after delaying getting married. \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if the 20 year old has a lot of unresolved feelings surrounding all of this that went ignored  by her father and OP.
