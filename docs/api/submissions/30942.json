Well during the event my dad asked what I wanted to Christmas. I first said IDK, I don't think I need anything, blah blah blah... but then added \"oh the $1200 you owe me would be nice\" and I chuckled. But no one else laughed. They just all kind of stared at me and him. He ended up getting mad and calling me cold and a brat. My mother insisted I apologize to him at once. I said I won't apologize for what I said since it's the truth. But I will apologize if what I said embarrassed him. It quickly escalated from there and I just ended up leaving. \n\nHe's owned me this money for a little over a year now. It was a vet bill that he couldn't pay and I didn't want there animal to suffer. So I offered to put it on a credit card if he would pay me back. He only have me $100 (entire total was $1300) which was my Christmas gift last year. The interest alone is hard to keep up with and I don't make that much money. \n\nSo AITA?\n\nEDIT: \nFor some context, I have spoken to him about paying me back before. The vet happened back in July and the bill came the next month. He and I both agreed upon $100 a month since that was doable for him. From Aug to Dec, I reminded him once a month since that's how often I see him. After Dec and his first payment, he stopped paying. I brought it again and each month he says the same thing \"oh I'll have it next month\" and trying to be the good child, I do not press him on it. I have asked my siblings and mother for advice, and they just say you'll get it when you get it.

Make sure you tell mom and dad that you put the money dad borrowed on your credit card and you don\u2019t have the money to put a unit off.  Make sure they know that you are paying interest on this every month and how much $$ the interest fees are each month.

It is no joke to put your kid in debt. How is this remotely fair?\n\nHis father paid $100 of $1300 over a 12-13 month period and allowed this bill to accrue interest. It is hard to swallow food when you've been used, there's no ongoing conversation on how this will be resolved, and then being asked to discuss a 'gift'.  When a parent can't extend basic respect and accountability to their son it is a very trying experience since people tend to trust their parent.

Dad and mom wanted to create a happy-happy time while one person at the table has been screwed for 13 months.", "Not quite sure how that\u2019s related to my reply. I was specifically commenting on parents telling kids they owe them for raising them, not saying parents have to give up everything for their kids, especially once they become adults.", "One private conversation over 13 months with 1 payment. This is not an agreeable nor ethical way for dad to handle this situation.  Perhaps it was a shock statement at dinner but OP's has been living with this burden with no dialogue from dad on how he is going to solve his loan....when he handed OP the $100 is was his xmas gift it was also a payment toward the debt so yeah....why bother discussing another 'gift' in 2023. Being in debt due to your father not paying it off is an isolating experience. Nothing wrong with the truth being told; sometimes your emotions take over. The 12+ month loan with interest is a fact; not fiction.\n\nPouring on the guilt of 'your parents raised you' is not a factor; It is their legal responsibility and to do so with no neglect are abuse.", "you don't need an arsenal of words... just restraint.", "\"you acted poorly, so i'm justified in acting poorly in a different context\"\n\ngot it."]}
