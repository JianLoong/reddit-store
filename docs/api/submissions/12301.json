But after a while, you will feel a wonderful sense of peace and a lack of disappointment and hurt.  I can\u2019t stand pettiness when it comes to thanking someone for a gift or thoughtful gesture.

You did not even get a thank you at a baby shower when everyone else was thanked? The only mistake you have made here was not stopping this years ago.

Hey is there a reason why I didn\u2019t a thank you too.\nHaving an adult conversation with adults seems more productive than a tit for tat.

They are being intentionally rude and ignoring you.

By the way, *hugs* I've been there and it hurt. Your husband though is an ass. He should have curbed this ages ago. He needs to apologize to your for it. Let him figure it out from here on out. Don't let any of them try to turn it around on you either.", "In case it's helpful to hear about gift-giving and other things you mention from the point of view of a stepchild whose (second) stepmother came into my life when I was already an adult:\n\n1. I found it extremely hurtful that my dad delegated gift-giving to my stepmother instead of putting his own thought and care into gifts as he had done previously. You may be receiving the side effects of their feeling of abandonment and wanting personal attention from their own parent. It's super thoughtful of you to step up, clearly, but it's likely pushing some painful buttons for them in a way that's not your fault but is there nonetheless.\n2. Honestly, I would have been upset if my dad's wife tried to call me her child. She had no hand in raising me. I've only known her as an adult, and I've never lived with her. She's my dad's wife. It's extremely awkward even referring to her as my stepmom. If I were you, I'd back way off from trying to refer to your adult stepchildren as your own children unless they've expressly said they want you to do that.\n3. I think your best bet re: having any of them warm up to you is your relationship with your husband's grandkids once your stepchildren have kids. My dad's wife was pretty lovely with mine on occasion when they were little, and if there hadn't been a number of other issues (such as making it very difficult to have conversations with my other family members whom I was unable to see often), that would definitely have helped me become friendly with her. (She also had an issue with waiting until the very last day of vacation, bringing over a large, very messy project to do with my children, and then leaving us to clean it up when we were also trying to pack, help cook for a crowd, clean up after \\_that\\_ and say goodbye to \\_many\\_ people -- after which she'd get upset that we hadn't cleaned up our location to her standards -- so anyway, I'd strongly recommend avoiding doing anything messy with the grandkids on the last day of their vacations to visit your husband's family; instead, early on, ask what works for your adult stepkids' schedules if that's the kind of thing you like to do. Sorry for the huge aside; that probably wasn't something you were planning on doing anyway LOL!)\n4. It's \\_perfectly fine\\_ for you not to have much of a relationship with your husband's adult children. Just don't get in the way of their relationships with your husband and their other family members. I doubt it's a problem for your husband's adult kids if you just step back, have a nice relationship with your husband, and stop worrying about your relationship with them. Think of them as friends of a friend. You don't really need to be close to them, and your husband can take care of gifts to them. They might eventually be better friends with you given time and a low-pressure environment, or you all might not be that compatible, and either thing really is ok.", "Yes, it\u2019s okay to step back. It\u2019s disheartening to do nice things over and over and never get a kind word for it. Let your husband do it and you just get them a nice card. I\u2019m not sure if your husband will have that same attention to detail that you have had. So, hopefully they will realize just how much trouble you went to to pick out the perfect gift for them and they\u2019ll rethink their actions.\n\nNTA", "NTA, I think it's 100% fine to ask your husband to take over gift buying and choosing duties for his children. What on earth did he do before you came along?\n\nIt sounds like they still have some discomfort around your relationship with their dad, or don't feel the strong connection you were hoping for. Adult children may not wish to be folded into \"our\" kids or accept you as a mother figure. This isn't just forgetting you or showing poor etiquette, it's a deliberate choice to ignore your participation in the gift-giving and make you feel bad.\n\nI do think it's worth noting that your husband should have stepped up before now to at least point out your contribution to choosing the gifts etc instead of apparently taking the credit?", "NTA. Do not buy anything for them. When their birthdays,Xmas etc comes around,let them get whatever their father gives them. AND,I wouldn't be reminding him either. Good luck..please update us if possible..", "Yes.  It sounds like Hubby enjoys the praise for her work.  That is about as greasy as it gets.\n\nOP, please step back.

Here you are disrupting the life they had with their dad for the decade prior - with no real obligation to them now that they're also adults - and you're giving them what they needed from dad years ago. You paying attention and going above and beyond shows them how much he didn't before you were in the picture. It can be hurtful to face the truth. If they are good people who only seem to act this way toward you and you haven't done anything to cause resentment, it might not be you at all. If they're spoiled, that's another story. Whether you keep at it or not is your call, but gifts should never come with strings.", "I think this is likely spot-on.
