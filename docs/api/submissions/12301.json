Now, if you are like me, this will give you all sorts of anxiety at first, but I promise you, it\u2019s very freeing.  Husband may get irritated by it.  But after a while, you will feel a wonderful sense of peace and a lack of disappointment and hurt.  I can\u2019t stand pettiness when it comes to thanking someone for a gift or thoughtful gesture.

You did not even get a thank you at a baby shower when everyone else was thanked? The only mistake you have made here was not stopping this years ago.

Hey is there a reason why I didn\u2019t a thank you too.\nHaving an adult conversation with adults seems more productive than a tit for tat.

They are being intentionally rude and ignoring you.

By the way, *hugs* I've been there and it hurt. Your husband though is an ass. He should have curbed this ages ago. He needs to apologize to your for it. Let him figure it out from here on out. Don't let any of them try to turn it around on you either.", "In case it's helpful to hear about gift-giving and other things you mention from the point of view of a stepchild whose (second) stepmother came into my life when I was already an adult:\n\n1. I found it extremely hurtful that my dad delegated gift-giving to my stepmother instead of putting his own thought and care into gifts as he had done previously. You may be receiving the side effects of their feeling of abandonment and wanting personal attention from their own parent. It's super thoughtful of you to step up, clearly, but it's likely pushing some painful buttons for them in a way that's not your fault but is there nonetheless.\n2. Honestly, I would have been upset if my dad's wife tried to call me her child. She had no hand in raising me. I've only known her as an adult, and I've never lived with her. She's my dad's wife. It's extremely awkward even referring to her as my stepmom. If I were you, I'd back way off from trying to refer to your adult stepchildren as your own children unless they've expressly said they want you to do that.\n3. I think your best bet re: having any of them warm up to you is your relationship with your husband's grandkids once your stepchildren have kids. My dad's wife was pretty lovely with mine on occasion when they were little, and if there hadn't been a number of other issues (such as making it very difficult to have conversations with my other family members whom I was unable to see often), that would definitely have helped me become friendly with her. (She also had an issue with waiting until the very last day of vacation, bringing over a large, very messy project to do with my children, and then leaving us to clean it up when we were also trying to pack, help cook for a crowd, clean up after \\_that\\_ and say goodbye to \\_many\\_ people -- after which she'd get upset that we hadn't cleaned up our location to her standards -- so anyway, I'd strongly recommend avoiding doing anything messy with the grandkids on the last day of their vacations to visit your husband's family; instead, early on, ask what works for your adult stepkids' schedules if that's the kind of thing you like to do. Sorry for the huge aside; that probably wasn't something you were planning on doing anyway LOL!)\n4. It's \\_perfectly fine\\_ for you not to have much of a relationship with your husband's adult children. Just don't get in the way of their relationships with your husband and their other family members. I doubt it's a problem for your husband's adult kids if you just step back, have a nice relationship with your husband, and stop worrying about your relationship with them. Think of them as friends of a friend. You don't really need to be close to them, and your husband can take care of gifts to them. They might eventually be better friends with you given time and a low-pressure environment, or you all might not be that compatible, and either thing really is ok.", "Yes, it\u2019s okay to step back. It\u2019s disheartening to do nice things over and over and never get a kind word for it. Let your husband do it and you just get them a nice card. I\u2019m not sure if your husband will have that same attention to detail that you have had. So, hopefully they will realize just how much trouble you went to to pick out the perfect gift for them and they\u2019ll rethink their actions.\n\nNTA", "NTA, I think it's 100% fine to ask your husband to take over gift buying and choosing duties for his children. What on earth did he do before you came along?\n\nIt sounds like they still have some discomfort around your relationship with their dad, or don't feel the strong connection you were hoping for. Adult children may not wish to be folded into \"our\" kids or accept you as a mother figure. This isn't just forgetting you or showing poor etiquette, it's a deliberate choice to ignore your participation in the gift-giving and make you feel bad.\n\nI do think it's worth noting that your husband should have stepped up before now to at least point out your contribution to choosing the gifts etc instead of apparently taking the credit?", "NTA. Do not buy anything for them. When their birthdays,Xmas etc comes around,let them get whatever their father gives them. AND,I wouldn't be reminding him either. Good luck..please update us if possible..", "Yes.  It sounds like Hubby enjoys the praise for her work.  That is about as greasy as it gets.\n\nOP, please step back.

Here you are disrupting the life they had with their dad for the decade prior - with no real obligation to them now that they're also adults - and you're giving them what they needed from dad years ago. You paying attention and going above and beyond shows them how much he didn't before you were in the picture. It can be hurtful to face the truth. If they are good people who only seem to act this way toward you and you haven't done anything to cause resentment, it might not be you at all. If they're spoiled, that's another story. Whether you keep at it or not is your call, but gifts should never come with strings.", "I think this is likely spot-on.

Yes, be civil, be helpful, be a good partner to your husband and \u201chis\u201d kids but stop doing the things that is giving them the opportunity to hurt you and disrespect you. Geez.", "This. NTA op", " You don\u2019t have to keep putting yourself into a position to be hurt.", "I think this is a good idea for everyone. Don't become responsible for gifts for your spouse's family.", "No mattwr ecen if it was dads mon3y, SHE chose the gifts, amd since sh3 thinks alot of what to gift them, she should definitely get a thank you at the very least. Ungrateful grownass kids and useless husband who doesn't stand up for his wife. NTA OP! I would definitely step away from gifting them anything else.", "Maybe op could get the grandkids stuff, but her husband can handle his kids. That was she can have someone who IS excited, because if you pay enough attention to a kid to learn the perfect gift for them, they're gonna go bananas with excitement. They're young now, so not a ton of amazing gift giving moments to be had, but if her step kids haven't noticed the quality difference in presents they certainly will then. And op has the perfect excuse: \"you never thanked me or gave much of a reaction, so I assumed you didn't like what I was getting you! I didn't want to upset you, so I had your dad take over the gifts. But I still want to be able to spoil my stepgrandkid a little bit with my own personal touch!\" Something that's very much \"kill em with kindness\" because being kind and gracious is the best way to rub salt in the wound of someone who fucked up", "But they\u2019re taking it out on OP?"]}
