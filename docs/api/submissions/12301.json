But after a while, you will feel a wonderful sense of peace and a lack of disappointment and hurt.  I can\u2019t stand pettiness when it comes to thanking someone for a gift or thoughtful gesture.

You did not even get a thank you at a baby shower when everyone else was thanked? The only mistake you have made here was not stopping this years ago.

Hey is there a reason why I didn\u2019t a thank you too.\nHaving an adult conversation with adults seems more productive than a tit for tat.

They are being intentionally rude and ignoring you.

By the way, *hugs* I've been there and it hurt. Your husband though is an ass. He should have curbed this ages ago. He needs to apologize to your for it. Let him figure it out from here on out. Don't let any of them try to turn it around on you either.", "In case it's helpful to hear about gift-giving and other things you mention from the point of view of a stepchild whose (second) stepmother came into my life when I was already an adult:\n\n1. I found it extremely hurtful that my dad delegated gift-giving to my stepmother instead of putting his own thought and care into gifts as he had done previously. You may be receiving the side effects of their feeling of abandonment and wanting personal attention from their own parent. It's super thoughtful of you to step up, clearly, but it's likely pushing some painful buttons for them in a way that's not your fault but is there nonetheless.\n2. Honestly, I would have been upset if my dad's wife tried to call me her child. She had no hand in raising me. I've only known her as an adult, and I've never lived with her. She's my dad's wife. It's extremely awkward even referring to her as my stepmom. If I were you, I'd back way off from trying to refer to your adult stepchildren as your own children unless they've expressly said they want you to do that.\n3. I think your best bet re: having any of them warm up to you is your relationship with your husband's grandkids once your stepchildren have kids. My dad's wife was pretty lovely with mine on occasion when they were little, and if there hadn't been a number of other issues (such as making it very difficult to have conversations with my other family members whom I was unable to see often), that would definitely have helped me become friendly with her. (She also had an issue with waiting until the very last day of vacation, bringing over a large, very messy project to do with my children, and then leaving us to clean it up when we were also trying to pack, help cook for a crowd, clean up after \\_that\\_ and say goodbye to \\_many\\_ people -- after which she'd get upset that we hadn't cleaned up our location to her standards -- so anyway, I'd strongly recommend avoiding doing anything messy with the grandkids on the last day of their vacations to visit your husband's family; instead, early on, ask what works for your adult stepkids' schedules if that's the kind of thing you like to do. Sorry for the huge aside; that probably wasn't something you were planning on doing anyway LOL!)\n4. It's \\_perfectly fine\\_ for you not to have much of a relationship with your husband's adult children. Just don't get in the way of their relationships with your husband and their other family members. I doubt it's a problem for your husband's adult kids if you just step back, have a nice relationship with your husband, and stop worrying about your relationship with them. Think of them as friends of a friend. You don't really need to be close to them, and your husband can take care of gifts to them. They might eventually be better friends with you given time and a low-pressure environment, or you all might not be that compatible, and either thing really is ok.", "Yes, it\u2019s okay to step back. It\u2019s disheartening to do nice things over and over and never get a kind word for it. Let your husband do it and you just get them a nice card. I\u2019m not sure if your husband will have that same attention to detail that you have had. So, hopefully they will realize just how much trouble you went to to pick out the perfect gift for them and they\u2019ll rethink their actions.\n\nNTA", "NTA, I think it's 100% fine to ask your husband to take over gift buying and choosing duties for his children. What on earth did he do before you came along?\n\nIt sounds like they still have some discomfort around your relationship with their dad, or don't feel the strong connection you were hoping for. Adult children may not wish to be folded into \"our\" kids or accept you as a mother figure. This isn't just forgetting you or showing poor etiquette, it's a deliberate choice to ignore your participation in the gift-giving and make you feel bad.\n\nI do think it's worth noting that your husband should have stepped up before now to at least point out your contribution to choosing the gifts etc instead of apparently taking the credit?", "NTA. Do not buy anything for them. When their birthdays,Xmas etc comes around,let them get whatever their father gives them. AND,I wouldn't be reminding him either. Good luck..please update us if possible..", "Yes.  It sounds like Hubby enjoys the praise for her work.  That is about as greasy as it gets.\n\nOP, please step back.

Here you are disrupting the life they had with their dad for the decade prior - with no real obligation to them now that they're also adults - and you're giving them what they needed from dad years ago. You paying attention and going above and beyond shows them how much he didn't before you were in the picture. It can be hurtful to face the truth. If they are good people who only seem to act this way toward you and you haven't done anything to cause resentment, it might not be you at all. If they're spoiled, that's another story. Whether you keep at it or not is your call, but gifts should never come with strings.", "I think this is likely spot-on.

Ungrateful grownass kids and useless husband who doesn't stand up for his wife. NTA OP! I would definitely step away from gifting them anything else.", "Maybe op could get the grandkids stuff, but her husband can handle his kids. That was she can have someone who IS excited, because if you pay enough attention to a kid to learn the perfect gift for them, they're gonna go bananas with excitement. They're young now, so not a ton of amazing gift giving moments to be had, but if her step kids haven't noticed the quality difference in presents they certainly will then. And op has the perfect excuse: \"you never thanked me or gave much of a reaction, so I assumed you didn't like what I was getting you! I didn't want to upset you, so I had your dad take over the gifts. But I still want to be able to spoil my stepgrandkid a little bit with my own personal touch!\" Something that's very much \"kill em with kindness\" because being kind and gracious is the best way to rub salt in the wound of someone who fucked up", "But they\u2019re taking it out on OP?", "NTA and let him pick everything from now and let him deal with it .", "NTA because gifts are to be appreciated", "NTA.

If he wants to get them a gift, he has to do the effort into finding and purchasing it.\n\nI mean, they aren't thanking you now, so nothing will change for you if you stop, right? But they might realise that dad is crap at gift-giving and wonder why it's all changed. Or they might not, either way, it doesn't matter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo they get you gifts for birthdays/Christmas etc?", "NTA I've stepped away from gift giving to my nieces and nephews on my husband's side because of similar issues. No thank you. Often no acknowledgement that the gift even was received (we ship them across the country). Certainly never a thank you note. The kids are young, so I fully blame the parents for not setting the precedent, but it's still upsetting each time. So we resolved to just do less.", "This sounds like a Husband problem where he is dismissive of ALL that you do regarding gifts and takes credit that YOU should get.\n\nSTOP helping him in this area and start making him take responsibility.\n\nSTEP BACK and put yourself first.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Except it wasn\u2019t step kids but just his side of the family (his parents, his nieces & nephews). After years of never thanking her or both of them and his family just thanking him. She told him she will no longer be responsible for gift giving to his side of the family. After he took responsibility, everyone gets gift cards (if he remembers). His mom had complained a few times. But she (my sister) doesn\u2019t care, and neither does her husband. It is what it is.", "NTA at all, you should definitely step right back and leave it up to your husband to sort the gifts. Maybe the kids will notice the difference, or even if they don't at least you don't have to put up with their rudeness anymore. I'm sorry they have been so rude and it doesn't seem like your husband has pulled them aside about it.", "NTA.  But I think counseling with your husband might help the two of you to address the situation.  \n\nIt's totally fine to not give gifts anymore, but that won't make you feel appreciated.  And the fact that you're not feeling appreciated in your family is a problem that needs to be fixed in its own right, independently of gifts.", "NTA. Step back and tell him he knows his kids better then you. They never say thank you so they must hate your gifts. He is in charge of getting their gifts from now on. Don't feel guilty even if he gets mad. He made them, and they have made is so known that your just an intruder in their life. So back off, and relax. Send in dad and tell him it will make his kids so happy.", "NTA\n\nI n f o: \n\n- has their father told them \u2018it\u2019s from us both, but your stepmom really did the work\u2019?\n\n- Do the kids mind calling you mom? Maybe don\u2019t push that norm on them, it would take care of the rest possibly. They are too old to even consider your kids - unless it\u2019s several years as in decade+ living together. \n\n- have you considered giving the kids separate gifts from you and dad? Let them see whose done what and give credit accordingly?\n\n- is their mom in this picture? Any discomfort at praising you cause it outshines their mom - so they\u2019re doing so sideways by noting \u2018dad upped his game\u2019 his game being you\u2026\n\nHonestly, it\u2019s not a kids problem imho - it\u2019s your husbands job to instill basic gratitude and politeness in them - that includes being kind to you!!! Appreciating your efforts! (That goes for your husband too - who is currently taking all the credit?!?!?). That is not encapsulated in a title of mom (which sounds like it maybe to placate you) - that title could be a distracting disservice/barrier to them knowing you (or lip service) in this case. Altogether misleading you and your efforts, by giving you the title, while in actuality they don\u2019t appreciate jack. Just gave you the job title.\n\nI\u2019ve been in actual jobs like it - a title and grunt work. I quit, and I wouldn\u2019t blame you. Go where you\u2019re celebrated, not where you\u2019re tolerated. You\u2019re right to keep the relationship and distance yourself from parenting - it seems like an obvious response to their behavior. \n\nBUT you maybe keeping the bath water while throwing out the babies. Just think about it. Hope this helps and sorry it sucks!\n\nAlso, I\u2019ve seen sooo many stories online over Christmas - many bioMoms have this same experience! They buy their own gifts, stick their own stockings. Many shared trying not to do their own and waking up Christmas to nothing or the most generic last minute minimum from dad only. And even many complaints the mom set it up for a pity party ruining their Christmas - imagine?! It maybe you\u2019re not alone and it\u2019s not a step issue in itself.\n\nWishing you the best.", "Your husband should be addressing this issue with their lack of manners and respect.  He could easily tell them that they need to thank you or the gifts will stop.  If he isn\u2019t willing to do that, you have bigger problems.", "NTA. The fact that your husband does not seem to mind getting the credit is awfull, if the thought is that the gifts are for both of you, then he needs to acknowledge this and remind them to also thank you for your effort.   \n\n\nMaybe they will realize that it is not that great having their dad buying all the gifts, when you stop....", "NTA - its very clear who does the gift purchasing.  But if you're stepping away from the gift purchasing then its not your obligation to remember birthdays or anything any more either.\n\nIf you find yourself 'reminding' him then he will automatically say he doesn't have the time etc and you will fall back into the old pattern.  What they need are a few birthday without their father even remembering and perhaps even Christmas when he gives them perfume / a gift card / socks\n\nThis assumption that you are his secretary and its your job to do this is unfair.", "Nta. Step back. Encourage amazon wishlists for your spouse and his kids.", "You're NTA, but your husband is for not taking care of this a long time ago.  He needs to have a very pointed conversation with his children and make it clear that they were raised better, he's ashamed of their behavior, and until they can thank BOTH of you for gifts (and give credit where credit is due), they will not receive any.", "Nta. Sounds like you4 husband likes being hero dad and getting praise off of your time, effort and attention.\nSo no, you aren't wrong if you step back. Clearly they don't respect you or like you. And obviously your husband is doing nothing to change their opinion of you and gas no intention of letting them know that you are the one behind all the effort", "NTA. You sound torn but you have to realize they do not appreciate you and your husband should put his foot down. If he doesn\u2019t, just ignore all these. Don\u2019t be passive-agressive about it.

I don't buy them, I don't receive them.\n\nIf someone wants something, they can buy it for themselves. Once everyone does this, the stupid notion of gifts can finally die.\n\nThe exception is kids, because they cannot buy their own things. They can, however, be given money and direction to find what they want. \n\nBuying random things that you keep a secret until people can't do anything but be thankful about them, no matter how awful or pointless they might be, is just a shitty system", "Yes, this a million times.

They may feel awkward that you are doing so much better in this arena than their actual father or they may be resentful of you. \n\nEither way, I\u2019d step back. It sounds like you came into their lives when they were late teenagers or adults, so I think I\u2019d step back your gift giving (just give a generic \u2018nice\u2019 gift).", "Even if you were using the dad's money, it's the thought that counts is a common phrase for a reason.
