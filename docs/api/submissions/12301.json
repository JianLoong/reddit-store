I\u2019ve always been the one to make things happen - someone wants something I figure out how to get it done. I've always been involved in the gift selection process for his children who are both in their mid/late-20s (1m, 1f). On my side of the family we've never done the step- words...and as it pertains to them it's always been **the** kids or **our** kids. I've used it in this title in case you feel it is pertinent. \n\nSo here is my issue...in each of these instances I do not get a thank you, I barely get a vague acknowledgment. I did get an awkward \"um uh um thanks I guess\" on one birthday. Gift-giving has been mostly initiated/pre-planned by me. I usually enjoy it.  I know it's not that the gifts have not been good gifts. I have overheard on more than one occasion one or both of them bragging about what their dad got them and how he's really stepped up his gift-giving game these days. It's hurtful. There's a lot of real estate between a hearty pat on the back and the disrespect I feel. Something in the middle would be nice.  I pay attention throughout the year to what they state their current interests are, an item they drool over, causes they like to support, etc. and what I would give for just a look-me-in-the-eye thank you sometimes. \n\nMost recently, 1 had a baby showers and there were multiple tables FULL of gifts from 55 different people...54 of them got a 'thank you'. Guess who didn't. The slight was so obvious that another woman turned around, laughed and said \"they didn't say it so I will...thank you!\" Yeah, not funny but I'll play it off, \"it's all good haha pregnancy brain.\" \n\nI get excited about gift-giving and how much they'll love something and I just end up feeling lousy afterwards. Honestly, now that I'm typing this out I realize that they know proper etiquette it really is that they just don't think it applies to me for some reason. \n\nSo AITA for telling their dad that I will NEVER disapprove of any money he wants us to spend on anything he wants to give to his children, I'm just no longer comfortable putting myself in that position when there is so little (or no) appreciation?

He can set the tone very quickly. Whether it works or not, would remain to be seen. But the fact that he is not stepping up on his own is a huge red flag. A lot of AHs in the story, but you ain\u2019t one. NTA.", "NTA\n\nTheir dad should've addressed this a long time ago and it's cruel to think you should continue doing it.\n\nA simple, generic thank you would suffice. \n\nI'm at a loss over their rudeness.  Unless you're the reason their parents' marriage ended,?", "NTA - tbh you should just announce that gifts are for kids, and just get the grandkid something.", "Your \"step\" children are TA and have no manners. It is not you so don't think it is and dont think you have to get thicker skin or whatever else is going through your mind.\n\nIf you're not going to talk to them about their manners, then what about your husband? He should have handled this a long time ago and it shouldn't be to this point unless he didn't know this was an issue. Do they thank him?\n\nI wouldn't spend a penny on them nor would I want to be around them if they treated me like shit. We don't know their side but at the end of the day, please and thank you matter. Their Father should be embarrassed.", "NTA. You really need to stick to your guns on this one. Your husband has really failed you and should support you 100% on this. But he will try to guilt you and so might others. Seriously, don\u2019t go buy any gifts for them. Buying them great gifts has certainly not garnered even a basic modicum of respect, and that goes for bit the recipients and for your husband. Some life lessons are best learned the hard way.", "NTA, stop and see if they notice, if they ask explain and see what they say. But seriously NTA", "One idea : you\u2019re great at gift giving, perhaps find children who need and will appreciate the gifts, e.g., hospitalized children, children in need, etc. Your husband\u2019s children clearly aren\u2019t interested.\n\nAlso, get counseling. Your husband isn\u2019t standing up for you, that needs to be addressed immediately.", "NTA.  How about you stop being responsible for gifts for them entirely?  Turn it over to husband.  When gifts are required for his children, he is full-on responsible to purchase, wrap and deliver them.  You handle your side of the family.  Now, if you are like me, this will give you all sorts of anxiety at first, but I promise you, it\u2019s very freeing.  Husband may get irritated by it.  But after a while, you will feel a wonderful sense of peace and a lack of disappointment and hurt.  I can\u2019t stand pettiness when it comes to thanking someone for a gift or thoughtful gesture.  There is no excuse for it.  So just let your husband handle them.", "Absolutely NTA!! \n\nThere is no situation in the world where an adult does not say thank you to another adult.  \n\nAnd YES, they are adults behaving like entitled kids. \n\nI can not imagine the disappointment you have been feeling. \n\nNo need to buy anything else for them. Let thier dad get them crappy gifts.\n\nI would channel your generosity towards others in your life who appreciate you.", "INFO - do they know you\u2019re the one picking out the gifts and not their dad? \n\nIn my house, gifts from my parents are gifts from both parents, and I\u2019m sure my mom gets more of the \u201cThank You\u2019s\u201d than my dad because we all know it was mom who got them. In this situation, the step-kids\u2019 are adults and their primary relationship is with their father. So when they get a gift from both of you guys, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re thanking their dad, not as a slight to you necessarily, but because they assume the gift is from him.  I just wouldn\u2019t be so quick to assume they\u2019re being rude/negative on purpose.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No one is forcing you to give them gifts which means you can stop at anytime. Their your husband kids. They are also adults in their mid to late 20s. Refering to them as our kids seems odd if you didn't have any hand in raising them.   So if he wants to give them gift than let him do it. At some point you have to stop put yourself out there to be rejected.", "Nta, however I still recommend getting them small things, like a gift card or something. I'm assuming they're just not open to the idea of having you as apart of their family and resent you in a way for replacing their bio mom. I know it's rough but sometimes, it's hard to let go that your parents don't love eachother anymore", "NTA. Once they are adults they don\u2019t need gifts, anyway.", "More information needed.  This is really odd behavior for adults as they seem to resent you.   What were the circumstances of their parents' divorce? Did you know your husband prior to his divorce?  If so, is it possible they feel you contributed to it?", "Based on the information here, you are NTA.\nWhy don't they like you?", "I think this is great advice. Where I live there are several local organizations that ask for people to \"adopt\" families in need for the holidays. Check with your local homeless shelters, city social services, and religious congregations.  I adopt a family every year from a domestic violence shelter, and receive a list of ages and needs/requests of every member of the family that I then go and shop for.  I know my gifts will be appreciated, and I often receive a thank you card after the holidays thanking me for helping them give their kids a special Christmas.\n\nI also second the suggestion to address this with your husband, either privately or in counseling.", "You recommend spending MORE money on them when they haven't showed any grace and manners? Heck no. I don't care about their feelings. Say thank you.", "NTA but honestly this is also on your husband. Stop with the gifts. His kids his problem.", "NTA at all. But why do you need to state anything about it? Just like Elza, let it go. Don't make a fuzz about it. That's what they want.", "NTA it seems your husband has conveniently sat back and let you do all of the planning, shopping, wrapping, etc. that comes along with giftgiving. That\u2019s a lot of emotional labor and time spent. His children credit him with the presence, but do not acknowledge you? You did not even get a thank you at a baby shower when everyone else was thanked? The only mistake you have made here was not stopping this years ago. Let him be in charge of purchasing the gifts for his own children, and maybe then they will see that really it was you making it special for them for all of these years.", "NTA. Stop giving gifts altogether. If your husband wants to, he can take care of it.", "You should stop selecting gifts for them and make sure they know that you\u2019ve stopped.  This is beyond rude.  I\u2019m a step kid and don\u2019t always get along with my stepfolks but I can\u2019t even imagine being this rude to them or anyone.  Your husband should have put a stop to it.  He can now take care of presents.", "NTA - they see you as their dads wife. So be that.\n\nYou do not have to prioritize these things if you do not want to. You don\u2019t owe them anything and buying their affections is clearly not a course that is seeing results.\n\nPlease free yourself from the \u2018mom\u2019 title they don\u2019t care for you to have, and just focus on being the wife and partner of your husband. You won\u2019t feel hurt and they won\u2019t feel pushed.", "NTA", "NTA. These aren\u2019t little kids who are sad about their mom and dad not living together anymore and are taking out their anger on you. These are grown ass adults.  \n\nThere\u2019s absolutely zero reason not to say thank you for a gift, even if you hate it and it came from a stranger.  I don\u2019t care if they don\u2019t particularly like you, you say thank you.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with you taking a step back. But your husband should step in and find out what the hell is going on. They don\u2019t have to like you, but they do need to respect you. He needs to defend your feelings and call them out. If there\u2019s something deeper going on, then he needs to investigate.\n\nI don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re asking for much.", "NTA", "YTA. They are not \"our Kids\".  Do the kids know you get the gifts, or are you assuming.  Put your own name on the card. Not their dad. Let dad  know.  You're going about it wrong. Have an  adult relationship with them. Not a parent child. Find friendship", "Honest question... Did your husband have an affair with you?", "Nope, OP should just let her husband select all the gifts for his kids/grandkids.  Let's see how much \"Dad\" ups his game in gift giving then.", "Naw. Buy them each a package of thank you notes, address them to herself, and put a separate post-it in each with the gift she wasn\u2019t thanked for written on it. But then, I have petty thoughts.", "Their parents had been divorced for a decade before we connected, but good question!", "The baby shower negated that possibility for me. Everyone gets thanks except for OP and it is so obvious that another guest points it out. There may be missing reasons in the post for why the stepkidd are so rude, but from what is relayed, I think they're just AHs.", "No, they had been divorced for about 10 years before we got together", "I love your petty thoughts!!!"]}
