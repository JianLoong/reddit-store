I've always been involved in the gift selection process for his children who are both in their mid/late-20s (1m, 1f).

I did get an awkward \"um uh um thanks I guess\" on one birthday. Gift-giving has been mostly initiated/pre-planned by me. I usually enjoy it.  I know it's not that the gifts have not been good gifts. I have overheard on more than one occasion one or both of them bragging about what their dad got them and how he's really stepped up his gift-giving game these days. It's hurtful.

He can set the tone very quickly. Whether it works or not, would remain to be seen. But the fact that he is not stepping up on his own is a huge red flag. A lot of AHs in the story, but you ain\u2019t one. NTA.", "NTA\n\nTheir dad should've addressed this a long time ago and it's cruel to think you should continue doing it.\n\nA simple, generic thank you would suffice. \n\nI'm at a loss over their rudeness.  Unless you're the reason their parents' marriage ended,?", "NTA - tbh you should just announce that gifts are for kids, and just get the grandkid something.", "Your \"step\" children are TA and have no manners. It is not you so don't think it is and dont think you have to get thicker skin or whatever else is going through your mind.\n\nIf you're not going to talk to them about their manners, then what about your husband? He should have handled this a long time ago and it shouldn't be to this point unless he didn't know this was an issue. Do they thank him?\n\nI wouldn't spend a penny on them nor would I want to be around them if they treated me like shit. We don't know their side but at the end of the day, please and thank you matter. Their Father should be embarrassed.", "NTA. You really need to stick to your guns on this one. Your husband has really failed you and should support you 100% on this. But he will try to guilt you and so might others. Seriously, don\u2019t go buy any gifts for them. Buying them great gifts has certainly not garnered even a basic modicum of respect, and that goes for bit the recipients and for your husband. Some life lessons are best learned the hard way.", "NTA, stop and see if they notice, if they ask explain and see what they say. But seriously NTA", "One idea : you\u2019re great at gift giving, perhaps find children who need and will appreciate the gifts, e.g., hospitalized children, children in need, etc. Your husband\u2019s children clearly aren\u2019t interested.\n\nAlso, get counseling. Your husband isn\u2019t standing up for you, that needs to be addressed immediately.", "NTA.  How about you stop being responsible for gifts for them entirely?  Turn it over to husband.  When gifts are required for his children, he is full-on responsible to purchase, wrap and deliver them.  You handle your side of the family.  Now, if you are like me, this will give you all sorts of anxiety at first, but I promise you, it\u2019s very freeing.  Husband may get irritated by it.  But after a while, you will feel a wonderful sense of peace and a lack of disappointment and hurt.  I can\u2019t stand pettiness when it comes to thanking someone for a gift or thoughtful gesture.  There is no excuse for it.  So just let your husband handle them.", "Absolutely NTA!! \n\nThere is no situation in the world where an adult does not say thank you to another adult.  \n\nAnd YES, they are adults behaving like entitled kids. \n\nI can not imagine the disappointment you have been feeling. \n\nNo need to buy anything else for them. Let thier dad get them crappy gifts.\n\nI would channel your generosity towards others in your life who appreciate you.", "INFO - do they know you\u2019re the one picking out the gifts and not their dad? \n\nIn my house, gifts from my parents are gifts from both parents, and I\u2019m sure my mom gets more of the \u201cThank You\u2019s\u201d than my dad because we all know it was mom who got them. In this situation, the step-kids\u2019 are adults and their primary relationship is with their father. So when they get a gift from both of you guys, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re thanking their dad, not as a slight to you necessarily, but because they assume the gift is from him.  I just wouldn\u2019t be so quick to assume they\u2019re being rude/negative on purpose.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No one is forcing you to give them gifts which means you can stop at anytime. Their your husband kids. They are also adults in their mid to late 20s. Refering to them as our kids seems odd if you didn't have any hand in raising them.   So if he wants to give them gift than let him do it. At some point you have to stop put yourself out there to be rejected.", "Nta, however I still recommend getting them small things, like a gift card or something. I'm assuming they're just not open to the idea of having you as apart of their family and resent you in a way for replacing their bio mom. I know it's rough but sometimes, it's hard to let go that your parents don't love eachother anymore", "NTA. Once they are adults they don\u2019t need gifts, anyway.", "More information needed.  This is really odd behavior for adults as they seem to resent you.   What were the circumstances of their parents' divorce? Did you know your husband prior to his divorce?  If so, is it possible they feel you contributed to it?", "Based on the information here, you are NTA.\nWhy don't they like you?", "I think this is great advice. Where I live there are several local organizations that ask for people to \"adopt\" families in need for the holidays. Check with your local homeless shelters, city social services, and religious congregations.  I adopt a family every year from a domestic violence shelter, and receive a list of ages and needs/requests of every member of the family that I then go and shop for.  I know my gifts will be appreciated, and I often receive a thank you card after the holidays thanking me for helping them give their kids a special Christmas.\n\nI also second the suggestion to address this with your husband, either privately or in counseling.", "You recommend spending MORE money on them when they haven't showed any grace and manners? Heck no. I don't care about their feelings. Say thank you."]}
