I agreed to be a groomsman. So it\u2019s me, him, and there other dudes. I was disappointed when I found out I wouldn\u2019t have a plus one for the wedding, but at the time I thought the same went for the other guys.\n\nCome to find out last weekend that the three other groomsmen do have plus ones. Two of them have been in relationships for less time combined than me. The other guy is single and was complaining about not finding a date to bring on Tinder (which is how I found out).\n\nI ask Kyle what\u2019s going on? Why do they have plus ones but I can\u2019t bring Hannah?\n\nI find out this. So, I\u2019m walking down the aisle with the bride\u2019s sister, Lisa. Lisa is developmentally disabled. She\u2019s in her twenties, but mentally she\u2019s about ten years old.\n\nKyle says it\u2019s because they don\u2019t want to piss off Lisa. Her parents figure she will never marry or have a boyfriend, so they want me to come solo to give Lisa the impression that I\u2019m single. Basically, they want me to be a pretend boyfriend for Lisa. If I come with Hannah, that will make her jealous.\n\nI\u2019m really not comfortable with this. Lisa is a nice girl, but I dont like that I\u2019m tricking her into thinking I\u2019m someone that I\u2019m not. It\u2019s scummy to make someone believe I\u2019m her boyfriend when I\u2019m not. Plus what if Lisa meets Hannah in the future and finds out we\u2019re together? She\u2019s already gotten into trouble in her adult care group for fighting with another girl over a guy.\n\nI told Kyle and his fianc\u00e9e Clare that I\u2019m not okay with thjs. They told me I need to suck it up for a day because this will mean a lot to Lisa.\n\nI\u2019m not comfortable playing pretend boyfriend, especially for someone who thinks we are the real deal. I want to drop out at this point.  Wedding is two weeks away.  \n\nWIBTA?\n\nEdit:  you guys are right, this is really fucked Il.  I called Kyle just now and told him we need to talk.  Face to face.  I\u2019ll update if anything happens.\n\nEdit2 6:51pst:  I\u2019m about to confront Kyle.  Pray for me.\n\nEdit3 8:25pst:  I\u2019m going to need some time to calm down.  My \u201cfriendship\u201d with Kyle is over.  And whoever said that I got roped in because Lisa had a crush on me, you win.  I\u2019ll fill you in when I\u2019ve had a moment.

Why does it have to be the guy who has been in the longest committed relationship? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour friend isn't a good frien  and he doesn't respect you or your relationship.

Not only would this be uncomfortable for you, you will be ticking a disabled and vulnerable girl. I am sure she would don't appreciate this either. Your friend as his fiance are playing with Lissa emotions and its not fair on either of you. \n\nAs you said, in future, if Lisa found out about your girlfriend, it would affect her greatly. Don't go to the wedding, these are not people you want to be around.", "NTA \n\nTheir plan is cruel to Lisa and just plain nutty", "NTA.  If they wanted a \"pretend boyfriend\" for Lisa, they should have chosen someone single who was willing to do that.", "NTA - Is this real life? I wouldn't go to a wedding that I wasn't allowed to bring my LTR to at all, let alone for a reason like this.", "The fact you voiced how uncomfortable you feel and they don\u2019t care makes you NTA at allll.

You weren't the minute you didn't get a plus one when you're in the wedding party haha I think that's bad enough! But this whole set up is ridiculous. I wouldn't want to do it and I would be extremely angry to have the situation forced upon me without my consent. That could be really anxiety inducing for a lot of people (I know I myself would be incredible anxious in a wedding party, never mind with this happening, really the only thing that would make me feel better is my partner being there...) and they just don't care? Very callous. They've also purposely hid it from you, which they did because they knew you wouldn't be happy about it, so they intended to knowingly take advantage of you. Personally I think they've been horrible\n\nI'm really curious if there's a reason why the single friend couldn't walk with Lisa? Why it has to be you, someone who actually has a partner? It honestly doesn't matter, either way NTA", "YWNBTA. \n\nThat\u2019s just not okay to anyone involved.

If they wanted that, they could have asked you.  Not deceive you, and then have you find out this way.\n\nAbsolutely drop out.  Your \"friends\" are assholes.", "You WNBTA. They aren\u2019t helping Lisa by giving her false hope. Tell Kyle immediately that you\u2019re not going and why. It\u2019s unfair to you, Lisa, and Hannah.", "NTA\n\nThis is very disrespectful to you, your girlfriend and also to Lisa, who should not be lied to and given a fake male escort for the wedding and treated like she's too stupid to understand because of her disability. I would send your regrets and leave Kyle and his family to figure things out.", "NTA. They can't even bring themselves to tell you in the first place huh?

Especially since you found out by accident. Like were they hoping you wouldn't notice? \n\nHonestly, Lisa's family is doing her, and you, a great disservice. If she already has issues managing her emotions I honestly cannot understand how they think this is the answer. I am a little baffled and a lot horrified. \n\nI wouldn't blame you for not going; I certainly wouldn't be comfortable perpetuating a lie like this either. The potential for it blowing up and seriously harming someone (emotionally or physically) is way too big.", "YWNBTA\n\nDo it. They have NO RIGHT to involve you in this game of deceiving a mentally handicapped person. I would also re-evaluate the friendship.", "You're NTA. What a cruel thing to do to Lisa. It's very disrespectful to trick her and treat her like a small child. It's also rude as heck to exclude your long term girlfriend when the other groomsmen are allowed to invite a date.", "NTA. The situation is weird, and the least they could have done is tell you about it well beforehand so that you would have had the opportunity to decide for yourself.", "INFO: Is this a real situation? They didn't think to mention this to you earlier? They were going to have you walk down the aisle with Lisa, expecting Lisa to think you were going to be her boyfriend, and just hoping you'd act like you were? Hoping that you wouldn't mention Hannah? That seems like a ridiculous plan.", "NTA. It will be very dishonest to pretend. You did the right thing by not wanting to participate in that. Don't those people have integrity?", "Kyle is attempting something that only exists in romance novels - the fake relationship becomes a real relationship trope.  The problem is that consent from both parties is required. It's not okay to trick Lisa into believing that you're her boyfriend. Frankly,  it's quite cruel.  You do not have to play into this farce.  NTA", "They should have told you this up front. Not wait until 2 weeks away from the wedding. I also find it completely disrespectful they did not give you a plus one they did the other groomsmen in general. No matter what they're scheming what's going to be\n\nIn reality if the sister has already gotten in trouble with her adult daycare place there's no telling what she's going to do during this wedding.\n\nNta", "Wtaf absolutely you would nbta. That's really really not cool.", "NTA. Thats twisted. Id be thanks but no thanks. And rsvp no.", "NTA - WTF is wrong with these people???\n\nIt is wrong to lie and mislead Lisa.  It will break her heart if she thinks you like her and then you don\u2019t see her again.  She will be left pining for you and you won\u2019t ever be able to be around her again because she will think you ghosted her or you have come back for her.\n\nYour friend is no friend to you.  It was mean spirited to not tell you and not invite your girlfriend.  They were trying to trick you into being Lisa\u2019s boyfriend for a day.  Imagine if you had found this out at the wedding when she is all googoo eyes over you and you have no clue.   Imagine the awkwardness and the inevitable meltdown.\n\nBack out now and let everyone else in the wedding party know why you are backing out.  People deserve to know the truth about how they were trying to trick you and Lisa.", "NTA. I feel badly for the family and Lisa, but the fact is they are using you.

Why would they think it\u2019s ago to mislead Lisa like that? Absolutely NTA", "NTA, and what they are doing 'for' (rather, TO) Lisa is reprehensible.

She still, at 51, doesn't understand that it's never going to be an option for her, even though she can't count to 100. It's so, so cruel to do that.\n\nNot only is it extremely unkind to Lisa, it's really gross for you. If she's fighting over a guy at daycare, are they sure she won't do anything inappropriate?

This case is especially heinous because you would be lying to a disabled woman and disrespecting your girlfriend and your own boundaries, all at the same time. \n\nTell them you're out and send them this thread so they understand how unbelievably warped their views are.", "No, you definitely would NOT be the AH. That's very strange what they're doing. All they're going to end up doing is making Lisa have an insane crush and end up heart broken. A similar situation happened with my cousin who is developmentally disabled and has the mind of around 10. My other cousin thought it would be cute to let his friend pretend to with her when she was 16 because she thought he was cute. Well long story short, she asked him if they were getting married and he was trying to play along and said wrll of course we are. Well she started trying to plan a wedding and it was a whole drama and my cousin ended up absolutely devastated and heartbroken. It was so sad. Don't play along, Lisa will just end up hurt.", "Tricking Lisa seems cruel.. nope NTA", "YWNBTA. That's toxic and dangerous given she already got into a fight over another man.

But tbh I feel like Kyle, fiancee, family and everyone else is an AH and you, too, *would* be an AH to participate in this weird farce of tricking a developmentally disabled person. What the actual fuck is wrong with this family.", "NTA.  Op I have a sibling who has a similar condition to Lisa.   I would be horrified if anyone did this to them.  The fact that Lisa's already had trouble fighting with another girl in her group home indicates things will go very poorly when she eventually finds out about your GF and if you are around your friend much she WILL find out.

Nopety, nope, nope, nope.  You are not responsible for Lisa\u2019s feelings.  Shame on her parents and sister for trying to make this your problem for the day.

What are they planning to tell her when you get married some day?\n\nYou can give Kyle options if you want (knowing that it may end your friendship):  you can bring your girlfriend; you can step out of the bridal party and one groomsman can escort two bridesmaids and you will be just a guest (with your girlfriend); you can be in the wedding party for the ceremony, but will then leave; you can just not attend any of it.   Let him decide. \n\nRight now I\u2019m feeling really sorry for Lisa. And you because your options are do what they want and resent them for the rest of your friendship  or refuse and have them be pissed at you and possibly lose that friendship.    The thing is, they see no problem with trying to force you to do something you don\u2019t want to do, but aren\u2019t taking into consideration that makes them all ass****s", "NTA - this is cruel to the sister, not kind. To give her a fantasy and make you part without your consent is wrong. You should drop out and explain exactly what you said hee. If they had told you sooner, you would never have agreed.\n\nI would wish them well and step away from their BS.", "NTA that's just wrong", "YWNTA. Their plan is absurd and just cruel all around.", "YWNBTA That is some of the craziest, most disrespectful shit I've ever heard.

Lisa\u2019s family are definitely the assholes here. They need to find an age appropriate way to deal with her emotions. The answer is not to have you pretend you might be interested in dating her. That is SO wrong on so many levels. I wouldn\u2019t go either.", "NTA. So they are using you as an unwitting escort for a developmentally disabled person who probably has a crush on you.

NTA, OP. Run from these people.", "NTA.  This is so creepy and disrespectful to you and Lisa.  I also think it's even potentially dangerous.  How far out are they going to play this?  Will Lisa believe you're dating and keep asking for you?  Will she tell people you're dating?  Maybe I watch too much SVU but could you get in legal trouble if she tells people you're dating and she can't mentally consent?  \n\nI wouldn't go unless you can bring Hannah and make it clear that she's your date.  Unless you think it's already gone to far and she could attack Hannah.\n\nThis is so messed up", "If they wanted you to do this, they needed to ask you when they asked you to be a groomsman.

I hate this for you and her.\n\n>They told me I need to suck it up for a day because this will mean a lot to Lisa.\n\nI doubt it and so what? She is your friend's soon to be wife's sister. She has nothing to do with you. How is this even offered up as an excuse?", "Whoa WTF NTA\n\nThis is so horrifically twisted and makes me nauseated.  They just did all this behind your back and expected you to play along?  It's gross and inappropriate that they're doing this to Lisa, and even if for some reason it wasn't completely out of line to do this, you definitely don't voluntell someone for it without asking them.  JFC", "NTA. No one should be a pretend boyfriend, I don't know what her family is thinking. This isn't kindness. This is deception.\n\nEven if you did go along with their foolishness, at some point, this girl's heart will break when she wonders why her boyfriend disappeared and never contacted her again. What if she contacts you on social media or gets ahold of your phone number? Just keep sucking it up? \n\nAsking the whole wedding party to make an extra effort to make her feel included throughout the day and make new friends is reasonable. Instead, this plan was hatched months ago, purposefully not inviting your girlfriend,  not telling you why, and putting this creepy expectation on you. Those are some top-tier shenanigans, and I'd avoid that wedding and that friendship.", "NTA. I\u2019d tell them either she gets to come or you\u2019re not going. That\u2019s an incredibly horrible thing to do. They\u2019re using you.", "Adios. NTA. No plus one for a member of the bridal party? I sympathize with their issue but to place it on your shoulders in this manner is unacceptable.", "NTA. I would not be okay with this at all what so ever in any way shape or form. Like hell nah!!!", "This is creepy as all get out. I strongly suggest you do not go to the wedding and lose the phone numbers of these people.", "NTA. This is absolutely ridiculous and disrespectful to you. Go have a nice dinner with your gf instead. It's not fair for them to not give you a plus one and even worst that's it's so you can be a pretend bf. Nope nope", "This is so crappy for all involved. I would give them a firm NO or drop out of the wedding. Even if you go through with this, after the wedding you obviously won\u2019t be Lisa\u2019s fake boyfriend anymore and that will probably upset her anyways. So either way this poor girl is going to be upset. This is the worst idea I have ever heard of.", "YWNBTA. \n\nThis is, at a minimum, cruel to Lisa, and rude to you and your GF. Worse: Lisa is a vulnerable adult. If she gets the wrong idea, tells her caregiver the wrong thing, or is inappropriate, it could cause you SERIOUS trouble. Do not tell her family this because they will probably flip shit. Just bow out \"sorry, not comfortable\" quietly.", "NTA but realize this might end your friendship with Kyle. \n\nWhat they are doing with Lisa is NOT kind to her. It\u2019s misguided.", "I work with special needs people, and they are not doing her any favors to lie to her. And it's unfair to you as well. Don't agree to this farce. Either you get a plus one like everyone else, or you bow out.", "NTA this is one of them rare reasons to miss a wedding short notice. This will end in disaster if you go, hold strong, your instincts are right.", "I think first of all them wanting a friend to pretend to be her bf is not fair to her; I think them trying to manipulate you into it is not fair to you. The bride, her family, and the groom are all assholes. You WNBTA.", "YWNBTA.\n\nThese people suck. They are planning on using you, and disrespecting you, your girlfriend, and Lisa.", "NTA. What they are asking you to do is condescending and cruel. It's terrible that they want to basically lie to her. It's also really messed up that they made this decision plan and didn't even let you know it was a twisted kind of set up. You should drop out and tell them exactly why. The only people at fault here are the bride and groom who came up with this terrible and potentially hurtful scheme.", "NTA. One of the *actually* single guys can walk her down the aisle. \n\nEven then, that dude should *not* be pretending to be her boyfriend, what kind of weirdo shit is that. He should be nice to her of course but nice and single is different to pretending to be her boyfriend - that shit is cruel.\n\nEdit: spelling", "YWNBTA: I\u2019m guessing they are also asking you to be her caregiver during this event as well. Most likely you\u2019ll be responsible for her the entire wedding and reception after. This is not a what a friend does. They ask you first and if your uncomfortable they figure something else out for her. Drop out and explain your points to them. The audacity of them is astounding in my opinion and I\u2019m sorry you have to put up with childish behavior from your so called friend.", "NTA, but it would be hilarious if the single groomsman brought Hannah as his date.", "This is just weird", "Nta. This sucks more bcoz they probably never planned to tell you until the day of the wedding. You reasons are perfectly valid.", "NTA. Drop put. Where do these people come from", "YWNBTA\n\nThey didn't even bother to ask you about this. I could see a situation where they ask you nicely if you could be Lisa's 'date\" for the event - just being a dance partner and be nice to her so she can feel special on this day too. I'd put my foot down on anything even suggesting anything romantic. If they had put it to you that way, you guys might have been able to work out a deal. They didn't. You have no responsibility to be their gigolo.\n\nIt's just insulting all the way around and cruel.", "NTA - They are for playing this high school shit with someone's feelings, as well as you. They're toying with someone who is disabled. That's about as fucked as it can get, but they're also expecting you to go along with it. \n\nPersonally I would no longer be on speaking terms with someone who thinks this is even remotely okay to do. They're fucked up people.", "NTA. They put you in this situation because they knew you trusted there was a good reason for not being able to bring Hannah. Your friend sees you as gullible and a follower for whatever thing he will come up with next. Their actions are very dishonest and low, you're in the right to make as big of a deal of this as you want. This friend would of lost any respect if they pulled this on me. You deserve better.", "You would be NTA. That is pretty scummy of them. I have a disabled brother like their sister and he would rather know and I would rather be honest with him. Your points are valid.", "Yea, you would not be the AH. This is so cruel to do to this girl. It would actually be worse for this girl when you don't see her all the time.

You pretending to be interested in Lisa or having to pretend to be single is ridiculous, manipulative, and wrong.", "NTA and dude... please run from this wedding. This is so unfair to you AND Lisa.

Good for you for forcing a conversation\n\nKyle and Clare are definitely TA for planning this. It's disrespectful of both you and Lisa.\n\nI assume you were chosen because she has a crush on you.

This is so fucking disgusting. I wouldn't go and I wouldn't speak to these people again. NTA", "NTA.  Expecting you to be someone's pretend boyfriend is not okay.  First of all they never even asked you if your okay with this and it puts you in an extremely uncomfortable position.  My guess is they didn't come clean about it up front because they knew you might not be okay with it.  They just planned on springing it on you the day of the wedding.

Inexplicably not give a groomsman a +1 even though he is in a committed relationship and all the other groomsmen got +1s... and then expect him just not to notice.\n2. Plan an elaborate \"fake boyfriend\" narrative.\n3. NOT TELL THE MAIN PARTICIPANT IN THIS FALSE NARRATIVE THAT IT IS HAPPENING...like what was their plan?\n4.

This isn\u2019t your problem. It\u2019s actually cruel to do to her too. They\u2019re toying with her emotions and it\u2019s wrong on every level. You are not a toy. Fuck these people.

But I mean would you go on a tinder date to a wedding?", "Oh they know he\u2019ll notice, but it\u2019s Their Day and are counting on the fact he\u2019ll go along with it rather than cause a scene. Afterwards I guess they don\u2019t care if he stays their friend or not but probably think they can guilt him into not cutting them off. They sound exhausting and no one needs friends like this.

And not inviting your girlfriend is just flat-out crazy, even if it wasn't farking rude.", "NTA. This set up is just cruel and bizarre. What do they think is going to happen after the wedding is over?", "NTA.  If they wanted to play this stupid game, they should have paired her with the grooms man who didn't have a girlfriend.", "NTA yikes! Not only are they wanting you to trick Lisa, but it sounds like they were trying to trick you as well by setting this all up without even telling you. And why didn't they set up single Tinder guy instead of you who they know are in a relationship? This is so so weird and outrageous. I'd not only drop out of the wedding, I'd permanently drop out of their lives.", "Find out the reason for not using single guy. \n\nYWNBTA however, not just for the plus one thing, more for the scummy set up.", "What an excellent point.  I suspect there is more to it because of course, they should pair Lisa with the single groomsman. I bet Lisa was given a choice and she chose OP. OP YWNBTA.  And shame on them for giving Lisa false hope.", "Nutty enough that I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they had a pretend wedding cake for op and the sis.", "Lisa probably has a crush on OP.  Sadly, if this scam has gone through, the odds are that she would become hyper obsessed with possession of OP and absolutely lose it on his GF if they met in the future.", "Speaking of the single groomsman, is it normal to bring a Tinder date to a wedding?", "At this point op is talking or finished talking but I want to stress that if the groom doesn\u2019t acknowledge that this was messed up and a bad position to put his friend in, it is absolutely a valid reason to reconsider that friendship. Agreed they don\u2019t respect him or his long term partner, they could marry and have a family (in the assumption that op would want that) and I\u2019d be very weary of how they\u2019d treat the now wife and kids. It\u2019s a very very bad precedent. \n\nHeck even if op was pressured into accepting, it is within his right to decline to participate in that ruse at any time. It\u2019s HIS reputation and HIS relationship and trust that\u2019s on the line.", ">So.... why couldn't the single groom's man be her \"date\" for the wedding? \n\nThe OP should stay away from that argument. No one should be her unwitting pretend date. The OP doesn't want to do it, that's enough and that's what he should tell his friend.", "Peace right out of that friendship", "My guess is that they picked OP to be her \u201cdate\u201d because they trust him \u2014 he\u2019s the least likely to actually try anything.", "> Why does it have to be the guy who has been in the longest committed relationship? \n\nBecause they figure he'll be the least likely to take advantage of the situation.", "I'm thinking that Lisa has a crush on the OP. \n\nThe whole thing is so cruel and gross.", "She probably expected it from the start and the family went along with it to keep her \"docile\". She seems to start fights when she gets jealous, so I imagine OP bringing his girlfriend would mean Lisa might cause a scene.\n\nIt's incredibly scummy on so many levels to do this because the other side of it is that the parents of the bride probably just want OP to mind her so that they can enjoy the wedding. Like yeah, it's fair to want to enjoy your daughter's wedding, but to blindside a guy to lead your developmentally disabled daughter along?? \n\nI cannot imagine even conceiving of such a disgusting plot, let alone putting it into action. So gross.", "That's my guess.", "They knew he wouldn't cooperate", "They need to take her for socialization with other developmentally delayed people and put her in a group home if she lives at home.", "Sorry, OP - just saw your update. That really sucks. :( Obviously, NTA.", "Thank you.  It's good to see someone pointing this out.", "Oh, but she's developmentally delayed, so it's not like she's a real person with feelings and needs, or a mind of her own, right?  \\*makes retching sounds\\*.  I really don't like people like Kyle and Clare.  At best, they're misguided and that's being extremely charitable.  \n\n\nNTA OP.", "N A H means \"no assholes here\" meaning neither party is an asshole. NTA is if you think OP is not the asshole, but the other party is being assholish. If you think they are being cruel, you should probably change it to NTA.", "But why exclude his girlfriend? He can walk Lisa down the aisle and like you say the family explain to her that he is not her date. If they hadn\u2019t left his plus one out none of this would be an issue.", "Here's how grown ups behave: You simple do not \"set up\" your siblings, behind your friends back, just to feed a dumb fantasy. It's disrespectful and cruel. There's no \"compromise\" to be done here. \"Weddings are hard\" it's not a get away with it card.", "He's not. \nOne of the other groomsmen is. The other groomsmen complained to OP about being unable to find a date on tinder.", "\"Don't want any drama someone else creates\"", "Even moreso, why would they choose the guy in the committed relationship to be the fake boyfriend and not the tinder guy..", "The fact that they chose OP to be the pretend boyfriend says to me that his girlfriend is not liked by the groom and/bride.  If that is the case, they don't have to invite her, but what they should not do is put OP in an awkward situation, as it is extremely disrespectful. It feels almost creepy.", "Yes, a \"pretend\" wedding, that's the ticket...", ">since she\u2019ll never actually have this\n\nI wouldn't rule out the possibility of her finding love in the future, though that relationship would have to be navigated differently, since she is at  a different developmental level mentally than the majority of adults (so it would probably be with someone on a similar level to her). But yeah, creating this whole fake boyfriend narrative is so ableist because it's so patronizing to her. It will only set her up for hurt to find out the relationship isn't real. Unless these wack jobs plan to set them up on fake dates to keep up the farce.", "I agree.  \n\nAnd they're trying to frame it like, \"pls do it to keep he peace for our special day... \"   Just another example of how far out of whack  bridal couple priorities are anymore.\n\nAnd I agree with posters above this could very seriously backfire and be detrimental to the sister. And now theyre going to their stupid wedding ahead of the mental and emotional health of a special needs person \n\nI m so tired of reading these ridiculous demands to maintain some farce for their \"special g.d. day.\"", "That is absolutely horrible!!   Was it just another manipulation to keep up a false narrative?\n\nLike, I'm imagining fiance wanted all her friends and family to believe she was closer to you than she was, and so she had to trick into it?\n\nThat's disgusting, and trashy.", "Wait. So you were tricked into being a bridesmaid? That\u2019s gross. How old were you and your sisters?", "That's what I'm thinking. I have an aunt who is developmentally about 14 years old. She has been obsessive when it comes to crushes and dating. She had to be told to stop coming to a particular optometry office, \"to get her glasses adjusted\", because she had a crush on a guy working there. My family looks out for my aunt, instead of encouraging fantasies. \n\nSo I think it's likely that Lisa has voiced a positive opinion of OP and that's how he ended up in this crazy scheme. The parents are the true assholes here, if this really was their idea.", "No, it's not. Bringing a stranger to a wedding is a recipe for disaster.", "Especially when you\u2019re in the wedding party!! The date would spend a huge part of the day alone at a wedding where they know no one", "No there\u2019s more going on here than they\u2019re even letting onto even now. There\u2019s a reason they aren\u2019t owning up to that it has had to be him from the start. They\u2019re likely leaving out that this girl already is obsessed with him, has a crush, or someone in her family has told her theyde be good together. It\u2019s not random that it\u2019s him as the most ineligible of them all \u2026. They\u2019re holding out of the full truth even now.", "If they're worried she will throw a fit, they should hire someone to chaperone her. My friend's brother is developmentally disabled and has loud outbursts when he gets frustrated. She hired one of the teachers from his adult day program to watch him during the ceremony and then take him home about an hour into the reception. He got to participate in the wedding, the caretaker made sure he didn't freak out, and best of all, no one from her family or wedding party had to spend their evening worrying about him.", "Plus OP becomes the bad guy after the wedding when he doesn\u2019t want to date her. This is all sorts of messed up.", "I think u misunderstood because it says she already assumes it\u2019s more than what it is and even if you were right he should be able to bring his long term girlfriend just like everyone else\u2026 date or not nothing is worth risking your happiness or future for someone else\u2019s feelings\u2026 but that\u2019s just my opinion.", "He may still be in WTF mode tho", "So what happened?", "Update after meeting ?", "Oh my OP. I just read your update.  I'm so sorry it turned out this way. But what a cockamainey idea!!", "Yeah I actually agree, but OP\u2019s reaction is the problem. Help the bride and groom out by bringing some better alternatives. The key point is that weddings are hard and families make it even harder. As the couple, you bend over backward to make everyone happy. A good friend would do their part to help fix a bad situation. We have no idea what other kind of complexities are going on behind the scenes in the wedding. OP needs to lead with empathy and help them understand and help come up with better alternatives.", "I did go on a Tinder date to a wedding. His bio literally said, \"I need a date to my cousin's wedding.\"\n\nIt was really fun", "\"Cool, then I'll just stay home\"", ">though that relationship would have to be navigated differently, since she is at a different developmental level mentally than the majority of adults\n \nExactly, and by pulling shit like this they are setting her up for failure. Instead of building her up and helping her navigate the world in her way they are warping reality to match hers. Or at least, what they've decided her reality should be. This is... really really bothering me.", "I blame them all. Whoever came up with this absurd idea, and the others for being complicit.  Silence is compliance.", "This whole group has issues it seems. Can you imagine meeting a guy on tinder and he brings you to a wedding where they\u2019re tricking a disabled women into thinking she\u2019s in a relationship she\u2019s not in?", "My wife\u2019s best man\u2019s platonic plus one invited a tinder hookup to our reception and I found out after dinner when she pulled me aside to tell me she might\u2019ve \u2018done something bad.\u2019 15 mins later she\u2019s *introducing her tinder hookup \u2014 a complete stranger that she invited to our reception \u2014 to my wife and I.* What a wacky day. Fun times.", "My brother gor married in a public park, w 11 people present, then had a barbecue. Mom brought the cake, I think 6 and 8\" layers", "A proper elegant response.", "They aren't trying to be kind, they are trying to shut her up for the duration of the wedding.", "From the post \"Basically they want me to be a pretend boyfriend for Lisa\". If they aren't making OP make up a pretend meeting story and stuff like that it seems like they want a date for her to be her \"escort\", dance with her etc...  OP might have misinterpreted this as \"pretend boyfriend\". Either way if he isn't comfortable about it he shouldn't be doing it and yes they should have informed him. I'm in agreement OP is NTA, but I don't think the scenario is as diabolical/malicious towards Lisa as it seems. They know she can't get a date so they paired OP with her. Common thing at weddings but usually done with single bridesmaids and groomsmen.  Again, I don't think this is OK without telling OP but I don't think brides side of the family is going to walk around the reception lying to their own family introducing OP as their mentally challenged daughters boyfriend.", "Seriously. OP please update.", "He told them he wasn\u2019t comfortable with the situation because they left his girlfriend out so he could act as Lisa\u2019s date which is not an \nappropriate thing to do. There is nothing insensitive about expressing his feelings about the situation because it\u2019s not cool to just expect someone to fill a role as someone\u2019s date without asking if they\u2019re ok with it.", "Yeah, it's cruel to her, rude to Hannah, and a shitty thing to do to OP.\n\nI hope your talk with the groom went well, OP. YWNBTA. \n\nThis is awful. To unwittingly use a guy like that without warning. What kind of weird, unethical, presumptuous people are they? This sounds like something out of arrested development.", "Loser move.", "I find it pathetic. He has such low self esteem that he has to hire someone to make himself look good? Or that he can't go alone?", "yeah people with intellectual and developmental disabilities very often do date! it\u2019s a common problem for them to be totally unprepared in terms of sex and relationship education bc their parents and other caregivers were in ableist denial about this topic. lisa\u2019s family is failing her in so many ways.", "One can choose a less pricy meal to avoid excluding guests.", "I was thinking his comment, \"Pray for me\" was meant in jest. I really hope it was!", "And speaking of consent, they didn\u2019t give OP the opportunity to consent to this whole farce.", "This is a but tricky to discuss given the nuance, but adults with intellectual disabilities will still have adult desires and needs. I do think they can consent in certain scenarios and we cannot write them off to a sexless existence against their will. They would likely need to be with someone on a similar level to avoid the power dynamic issues.\n\nThat being said, Lisa\u2019s family is 100% handling this extremely inappropriately. They need a plan to support her desire for a boyfriend by enforcing boundaries and appropriate behavior rather than placate her and rob her of the chance of developing a genuine connection at the adult home or someone else suitable in the community.", "And she is in her 20s and can have physical urges that she does not understand. Once OP walks away, she is fair game for any person she runs into.", "So an escort?", "Me too, the suspense is killing me. Maybe Kyle accidently brought Lisa - (she heard about the meeting and hid in the back seat of Kyle's car and heard EVERYTHING.) She probably started hitting OP in the head with a Mexican Coke bottle and probably biting too. I hope the ambulance got there in time to save OP. But, problem solved? Lisa was put on psych hold for 72 hours, after that she's going to jail for assault and battery. \nWell it could have happened that way, maybe.", "It's also pretty telling that they didn't inform OP until he specifically asked about why he didn't get a plus one. I'm wondering if the guess about the crush is correct that that's the main reason why OP was even asked to be a groomsman.\n\nEven if they are willing to continue the friendship after dropping out, I'd be going cold on the friendship and wouldn't lose any sleep if they never make contact again.", "Came here to say this. Consent was far too deep in the comments for my comfort.", "Exactly!  When were they going to tell OP that he was going to be a fake boyfriend for Lisa?", "This, This, This!!!!!    Well said", "My Mum is a (now retired special ed teacher) so I have a bit of an understanding about disability and I wholeheartedly agree with this.", "Plus, if she ever met Hannah, she could assault her for \"stealing her beau\" - she's done similar before.", "Which is terrifying!", "You are my exact opposite in every way and I love that for you. Have fun with your purse shrampies!", "I'm getting a \"Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!\" vibe", "Maybe Kyle is actually like a paramedic and was able to dress OP\u2019s wounds. Then he realized how much trouble Lisa was in, and how happy she\u2019d be if OP was hers forever. He\u2019s dragged OP off to the family cottage and is consulting his fianc\u00e9e about his difficult it would be to create a bunker and keep OP there forever, to be Lisa\u2019s best friend. Something like that.", "This is why this group is a target of sex offenders.", "You heard it from OP, who heard it from his friend, who probably heard it from his parents, who either heard it from the person in question or from the staff. If they heard it from the staff, it may not have been witnessed by staff. My point is that you're hearing this third, fourth, or fifth hand, which is not sufficiently close to the situation to assess the vibes.", "Username checks out in the best way", "I'm like 99% sure Bumble offers a special badge you can put on your profile to let potential matches know you're up for being a wedding +1. \ud83e\udd37 Go forth and partay!", "ARE YOU SERIOUS RN\n\nOff to check bumble...
