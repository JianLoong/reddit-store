I agreed to be a groomsman. So it\u2019s me, him, and there other dudes. I was disappointed when I found out I wouldn\u2019t have a plus one for the wedding, but at the time I thought the same went for the other guys.\n\nCome to find out last weekend that the three other groomsmen do have plus ones. Two of them have been in relationships for less time combined than me. The other guy is single and was complaining about not finding a date to bring on Tinder (which is how I found out).\n\nI ask Kyle what\u2019s going on? Why do they have plus ones but I can\u2019t bring Hannah?\n\nI find out this. So, I\u2019m walking down the aisle with the bride\u2019s sister, Lisa. Lisa is developmentally disabled. She\u2019s in her twenties, but mentally she\u2019s about ten years old.\n\nKyle says it\u2019s because they don\u2019t want to piss off Lisa. Her parents figure she will never marry or have a boyfriend, so they want me to come solo to give Lisa the impression that I\u2019m single. Basically, they want me to be a pretend boyfriend for Lisa. If I come with Hannah, that will make her jealous.\n\nI\u2019m really not comfortable with this. Lisa is a nice girl, but I dont like that I\u2019m tricking her into thinking I\u2019m someone that I\u2019m not. It\u2019s scummy to make someone believe I\u2019m her boyfriend when I\u2019m not. Plus what if Lisa meets Hannah in the future and finds out we\u2019re together? She\u2019s already gotten into trouble in her adult care group for fighting with another girl over a guy.\n\nI told Kyle and his fianc\u00e9e Clare that I\u2019m not okay with thjs. They told me I need to suck it up for a day because this will mean a lot to Lisa.\n\nI\u2019m not comfortable playing pretend boyfriend, especially for someone who thinks we are the real deal. I want to drop out at this point.  Wedding is two weeks away.  \n\nWIBTA?", "created_utc": 1684537418, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13maq06/wibta_for_dropping_out_of_a_wedding_when_its_two/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Besides, one of the groomsmen is actually single.  If they want to conduct this farce, why don't they pair her with him?!", "So.... why couldn't the single groom's man be her \"date\" for the wedding? Why does it have to be the guy who has been in the longest committed relationship? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour friend isn't a good frien  and he doesn't respect you or your relationship. Nope, peace right out of that crap and don't even feel bad even if it's the week of the wedding. That was extremely shitty of them to do to you and not even be upfront about at all.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nThis is so weird and wrong. Not only would this be uncomfortable for you, you will be ticking a disabled and vulnerable girl. I am sure she would don't appreciate this either. Your friend as his fiance are playing with Lissa emotions and its not fair on either of you. \n\nAs you said, in future, if Lisa found out about your girlfriend, it would affect her greatly. Don't go to the wedding, these are not people you want to be around.", "NTA \n\nTheir plan is cruel to Lisa and just plain nutty", "NTA.  If they wanted a \"pretend boyfriend\" for Lisa, they should have chosen someone single who was willing to do that.", "NTA - Is this real life? I wouldn't go to a wedding that I wasn't allowed to bring my LTR to at all, let alone for a reason like this.", "The fact you voiced how uncomfortable you feel and they don\u2019t care makes you NTA at allll. If they really want you there, they\u2019d change it so you are comfortable", "NTA they literally lied to you and tried to hide it until the day of", "NTA. You weren't the minute you didn't get a plus one when you're in the wedding party haha I think that's bad enough! But this whole set up is ridiculous. I wouldn't want to do it and I would be extremely angry to have the situation forced upon me without my consent. That could be really anxiety inducing for a lot of people (I know I myself would be incredible anxious in a wedding party, never mind with this happening, really the only thing that would make me feel better is my partner being there...) and they just don't care? Very callous. They've also purposely hid it from you, which they did because they knew you wouldn't be happy about it, so they intended to knowingly take advantage of you. Personally I think they've been horrible\n\nI'm really curious if there's a reason why the single friend couldn't walk with Lisa? Why it has to be you, someone who actually has a partner? It honestly doesn't matter, either way NTA", "YWNBTA. \n\nThat\u2019s just not okay to anyone involved. I wouldn\u2019t have even accepted if a partner I was with for years wasn\u2019t invited, but their reason is shitty. I would talk to them once, and make it clear that you won\u2019t go without your gf, and if that makes Lisa upset then you\u2019re fine staying home.", "WTF\n\nNo, YWNBTA.\n\nRidiculous.  If they wanted that, they could have asked you.  Not deceive you, and then have you find out this way.\n\nAbsolutely drop out.  Your \"friends\" are assholes.", "You WNBTA. They aren\u2019t helping Lisa by giving her false hope. Tell Kyle immediately that you\u2019re not going and why. It\u2019s unfair to you, Lisa, and Hannah.", "NTA\n\nThis is very disrespectful to you, your girlfriend and also to Lisa, who should not be lied to and given a fake male escort for the wedding and treated like she's too stupid to understand because of her disability. I would send your regrets and leave Kyle and his family to figure things out.", "NTA. They can't even bring themselves to tell you in the first place huh? That says a lot\n\nYou did not agree to it and they are forcing this onto you.\nMight also reconsider the friendship", "NTA - Mr. Tinder can pretend to be a date for Lisa if that is the illusion they are trying to sell!!!", "Weird! That\u2019s not okay that they\u2019re just using you for this. Absolutely unacceptable. NTA", "NTA. Kyle should\u2019ve told you about this first! He didn\u2019t gave you the opportunity to discuss or think about it! If he told you sooner, you wouldn\u2019t drop at two weeks before the wedding, then you could\u2019ve made your decision sooner.", "This is the only situation I\u2019ve seen lately where I think dropping out last minute is 100% justifiable. Going alone with their plans not only hurts your real relationship but can cause future damage for Lisa\u2019s too. The fact they tried to use you without your knowledge is not okay. NTA. \n\nOne question- does Lisa know you and the other groomsmen (specifically the single one)? I\u2019d be concerned Lisa is already expecting you to be her date and if they knew she liked you.", "No, you DON\u2019T need to suck it up for a day. Disrespectful to you, her, and your girlfriend. \nThe colossal nerve of doing it without even speaking to you first. And what are you supposed to do entertain her for the whole time? Perhaps you\u2019re her boyfriend/babysitter for the wedding? Poo on that. \nI would say no no no no thank you. Don\u2019t go. NTA", "NTA\n\nI can't imagine that actually playing out well no matter what.\n\nThe weird-ass conditions you were invited under should have been communicated to you from the start. Not snuck onto you. Even if it's just a gross idea that could only hurt feelings from the start.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - I sort of get where they are coming from (in a messed up way), but honestly, it just seems cruel to Lisa and absolutely horrible to you. Especially since you found out by accident. Like were they hoping you wouldn't notice? \n\nHonestly, Lisa's family is doing her, and you, a great disservice. If she already has issues managing her emotions I honestly cannot understand how they think this is the answer. I am a little baffled and a lot horrified. \n\nI wouldn't blame you for not going; I certainly wouldn't be comfortable perpetuating a lie like this either. The potential for it blowing up and seriously harming someone (emotionally or physically) is way too big.", "YWNBTA\n\nDo it. They have NO RIGHT to involve you in this game of deceiving a mentally handicapped person. I would also re-evaluate the friendship.", "You're NTA. What a cruel thing to do to Lisa. It's very disrespectful to trick her and treat her like a small child. It's also rude as heck to exclude your long term girlfriend when the other groomsmen are allowed to invite a date.", "NTA. The situation is weird, and the least they could have done is tell you about it well beforehand so that you would have had the opportunity to decide for yourself.", "INFO: Is this a real situation? They didn't think to mention this to you earlier? They were going to have you walk down the aisle with Lisa, expecting Lisa to think you were going to be her boyfriend, and just hoping you'd act like you were? Hoping that you wouldn't mention Hannah? That seems like a ridiculous plan.", "NTA. It will be very dishonest to pretend. You did the right thing by not wanting to participate in that. Don't those people have integrity?", "Kyle is attempting something that only exists in romance novels - the fake relationship becomes a real relationship trope.  The problem is that consent from both parties is required. It's not okay to trick Lisa into believing that you're her boyfriend. Frankly,  it's quite cruel.  You do not have to play into this farce.  NTA", "They should have told you this up front. Not wait until 2 weeks away from the wedding. I also find it completely disrespectful they did not give you a plus one they did the other groomsmen in general. No matter what they're scheming what's going to be\n\nIn reality if the sister has already gotten in trouble with her adult daycare place there's no telling what she's going to do during this wedding.\n\nNta", "Wtaf absolutely you would nbta. That's really really not cool.", "NTA. Thats twisted. Id be thanks but no thanks. And rsvp no.", "NTA - WTF is wrong with these people???\n\nIt is wrong to lie and mislead Lisa.  It will break her heart if she thinks you like her and then you don\u2019t see her again.  She will be left pining for you and you won\u2019t ever be able to be around her again because she will think you ghosted her or you have come back for her.\n\nYour friend is no friend to you.  It was mean spirited to not tell you and not invite your girlfriend.  They were trying to trick you into being Lisa\u2019s boyfriend for a day.  Imagine if you had found this out at the wedding when she is all googoo eyes over you and you have no clue.   Imagine the awkwardness and the inevitable meltdown.\n\nBack out now and let everyone else in the wedding party know why you are backing out.  People deserve to know the truth about how they were trying to trick you and Lisa.", "NTA. I feel badly for the family and Lisa, but the fact is they are using you. I would not participate in this.", "NTA, skip the wedding.", "I would for tell tell them that isn\u2019t going to happen. NTA", "Wtf is wrong with these people? Why would they think it\u2019s ago to mislead Lisa like that? Absolutely NTA", "NTA, and what they are doing 'for' (rather, TO) Lisa is reprehensible. I'd 'suck up' the costs and drop out, otherwise you are party to harming a person who is going to be devastated when they don't see you again. They are being horrible to both you and Lisa.", "I\u2019d no call no show! WNBTA", "nta. i'd skip the wedding too", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
