I agreed to be a groomsman. So it\u2019s me, him, and there other dudes. I was disappointed when I found out I wouldn\u2019t have a plus one for the wedding, but at the time I thought the same went for the other guys.\n\nCome to find out last weekend that the three other groomsmen do have plus ones. Two of them have been in relationships for less time combined than me. The other guy is single and was complaining about not finding a date to bring on Tinder (which is how I found out).\n\nI ask Kyle what\u2019s going on? Why do they have plus ones but I can\u2019t bring Hannah?\n\nI find out this. So, I\u2019m walking down the aisle with the bride\u2019s sister, Lisa. Lisa is developmentally disabled. She\u2019s in her twenties, but mentally she\u2019s about ten years old.\n\nKyle says it\u2019s because they don\u2019t want to piss off Lisa. Her parents figure she will never marry or have a boyfriend, so they want me to come solo to give Lisa the impression that I\u2019m single. Basically, they want me to be a pretend boyfriend for Lisa. If I come with Hannah, that will make her jealous.\n\nI\u2019m really not comfortable with this. Lisa is a nice girl, but I dont like that I\u2019m tricking her into thinking I\u2019m someone that I\u2019m not. It\u2019s scummy to make someone believe I\u2019m her boyfriend when I\u2019m not. Plus what if Lisa meets Hannah in the future and finds out we\u2019re together? She\u2019s already gotten into trouble in her adult care group for fighting with another girl over a guy.\n\nI told Kyle and his fianc\u00e9e Clare that I\u2019m not okay with thjs. They told me I need to suck it up for a day because this will mean a lot to Lisa.\n\nI\u2019m not comfortable playing pretend boyfriend, especially for someone who thinks we are the real deal. I want to drop out at this point.  Wedding is two weeks away.  \n\nWIBTA?\n\nEdit:  you guys are right, this is really fucked Il.  I called Kyle just now and told him we need to talk.  Face to face.  I\u2019ll update if anything happens.\n\nEdit2 6:51pst:  I\u2019m about to confront Kyle.

Why does it have to be the guy who has been in the longest committed relationship? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour friend isn't a good frien  and he doesn't respect you or your relationship. Nope, peace right out of that crap and don't even feel bad even if it's the week of the wedding.

Your friend as his fiance are playing with Lissa emotions and its not fair on either of you. \n\nAs you said, in future, if Lisa found out about your girlfriend, it would affect her greatly. Don't go to the wedding, these are not people you want to be around.", "NTA \n\nTheir plan is cruel to Lisa and just plain nutty", "NTA.  If they wanted a \"pretend boyfriend\" for Lisa, they should have chosen someone single who was willing to do that.", "NTA - Is this real life? I wouldn't go to a wedding that I wasn't allowed to bring my LTR to at all, let alone for a reason like this.", "The fact you voiced how uncomfortable you feel and they don\u2019t care makes you NTA at allll.

You weren't the minute you didn't get a plus one when you're in the wedding party haha I think that's bad enough! But this whole set up is ridiculous. I wouldn't want to do it and I would be extremely angry to have the situation forced upon me without my consent. That could be really anxiety inducing for a lot of people (I know I myself would be incredible anxious in a wedding party, never mind with this happening, really the only thing that would make me feel better is my partner being there...) and they just don't care? Very callous. They've also purposely hid it from you, which they did because they knew you wouldn't be happy about it, so they intended to knowingly take advantage of you. Personally I think they've been horrible\n\nI'm really curious if there's a reason why the single friend couldn't walk with Lisa? Why it has to be you, someone who actually has a partner? It honestly doesn't matter, either way NTA", "YWNBTA. \n\nThat\u2019s just not okay to anyone involved.

If they wanted that, they could have asked you.  Not deceive you, and then have you find out this way.\n\nAbsolutely drop out.  Your \"friends\" are assholes.", "You WNBTA. They aren\u2019t helping Lisa by giving her false hope. Tell Kyle immediately that you\u2019re not going and why. It\u2019s unfair to you, Lisa, and Hannah.", "NTA\n\nThis is very disrespectful to you, your girlfriend and also to Lisa, who should not be lied to and given a fake male escort for the wedding and treated like she's too stupid to understand because of her disability.

Going alone with their plans not only hurts your real relationship but can cause future damage for Lisa\u2019s too. The fact they tried to use you without your knowledge is not okay. NTA. \n\nOne question- does Lisa know you and the other groomsmen (specifically the single one)? I\u2019d be concerned Lisa is already expecting you to be her date and if they knew she liked you.", "No, you DON\u2019T need to suck it up for a day.

Especially since you found out by accident. Like were they hoping you wouldn't notice? \n\nHonestly, Lisa's family is doing her, and you, a great disservice. If she already has issues managing her emotions I honestly cannot understand how they think this is the answer. I am a little baffled and a lot horrified. \n\nI wouldn't blame you for not going; I certainly wouldn't be comfortable perpetuating a lie like this either. The potential for it blowing up and seriously harming someone (emotionally or physically) is way too big.", "YWNBTA\n\nDo it. They have NO RIGHT to involve you in this game of deceiving a mentally handicapped person. I would also re-evaluate the friendship.", "You're NTA. What a cruel thing to do to Lisa. It's very disrespectful to trick her and treat her like a small child. It's also rude as heck to exclude your long term girlfriend when the other groomsmen are allowed to invite a date.", "NTA. The situation is weird, and the least they could have done is tell you about it well beforehand so that you would have had the opportunity to decide for yourself.", "INFO: Is this a real situation? They didn't think to mention this to you earlier? They were going to have you walk down the aisle with Lisa, expecting Lisa to think you were going to be her boyfriend, and just hoping you'd act like you were? Hoping that you wouldn't mention Hannah? That seems like a ridiculous plan.", "NTA. It will be very dishonest to pretend. You did the right thing by not wanting to participate in that. Don't those people have integrity?", "Kyle is attempting something that only exists in romance novels - the fake relationship becomes a real relationship trope.  The problem is that consent from both parties is required. It's not okay to trick Lisa into believing that you're her boyfriend. Frankly,  it's quite cruel.  You do not have to play into this farce.  NTA", "They should have told you this up front. Not wait until 2 weeks away from the wedding. I also find it completely disrespectful they did not give you a plus one they did the other groomsmen in general. No matter what they're scheming what's going to be\n\nIn reality if the sister has already gotten in trouble with her adult daycare place there's no telling what she's going to do during this wedding.\n\nNta", "Wtaf absolutely you would nbta. That's really really not cool.", "NTA. Thats twisted. Id be thanks but no thanks. And rsvp no.", "NTA - WTF is wrong with these people???\n\nIt is wrong to lie and mislead Lisa.  It will break her heart if she thinks you like her and then you don\u2019t see her again.  She will be left pining for you and you won\u2019t ever be able to be around her again because she will think you ghosted her or you have come back for her.\n\nYour friend is no friend to you.  It was mean spirited to not tell you and not invite your girlfriend.  They were trying to trick you into being Lisa\u2019s boyfriend for a day.  Imagine if you had found this out at the wedding when she is all googoo eyes over you and you have no clue.   Imagine the awkwardness and the inevitable meltdown.\n\nBack out now and let everyone else in the wedding party know why you are backing out.  People deserve to know the truth about how they were trying to trick you and Lisa.", "NTA. I feel badly for the family and Lisa, but the fact is they are using you.

Why would they think it\u2019s ago to mislead Lisa like that? Absolutely NTA", "NTA, and what they are doing 'for' (rather, TO) Lisa is reprehensible.

A similar situation happened with my cousin who is developmentally disabled and has the mind of around 10. My other cousin thought it would be cute to let his friend pretend to with her when she was 16 because she thought he was cute. Well long story short, she asked him if they were getting married and he was trying to play along and said wrll of course we are. Well she started trying to plan a wedding and it was a whole drama and my cousin ended up absolutely devastated and heartbroken. It was so sad. Don't play along, Lisa will just end up hurt.", "Tricking Lisa seems cruel.. nope NTA", "YWNBTA. That's toxic and dangerous given she already got into a fight over another man.

But tbh I feel like Kyle, fiancee, family and everyone else is an AH and you, too, *would* be an AH to participate in this weird farce of tricking a developmentally disabled person. What the actual fuck is wrong with this family.", "NTA.  Op I have a sibling who has a similar condition to Lisa.   I would be horrified if anyone did this to them.  The fact that Lisa's already had trouble fighting with another girl in her group home indicates things will go very poorly when she eventually finds out about your GF and if you are around your friend much she WILL find out.

Nopety, nope, nope, nope.  You are not responsible for Lisa\u2019s feelings.  Shame on her parents and sister for trying to make this your problem for the day.

What are they planning to tell her when you get married some day?\n\nYou can give Kyle options if you want (knowing that it may end your friendship):  you can bring your girlfriend; you can step out of the bridal party and one groomsman can escort two bridesmaids and you will be just a guest (with your girlfriend); you can be in the wedding party for the ceremony, but will then leave; you can just not attend any of it.   Let him decide. \n\nRight now I\u2019m feeling really sorry for Lisa. And you because your options are do what they want and resent them for the rest of your friendship  or refuse and have them be pissed at you and possibly lose that friendship.    The thing is, they see no problem with trying to force you to do something you don\u2019t want to do, but aren\u2019t taking into consideration that makes them all ass****s", "NTA - this is cruel to the sister, not kind. To give her a fantasy and make you part without your consent is wrong. You should drop out and explain exactly what you said hee.

Lisa\u2019s family are definitely the assholes here. They need to find an age appropriate way to deal with her emotions. The answer is not to have you pretend you might be interested in dating her. That is SO wrong on so many levels. I wouldn\u2019t go either.", "NTA. So they are using you as an unwitting escort for a developmentally disabled person who probably has a crush on you.

NTA, OP. Run from these people.", "NTA.  This is so creepy and disrespectful to you and Lisa.  I also think it's even potentially dangerous.  How far out are they going to play this?  Will Lisa believe you're dating and keep asking for you?  Will she tell people you're dating?  Maybe I watch too much SVU but could you get in legal trouble if she tells people you're dating and she can't mentally consent?  \n\nI wouldn't go unless you can bring Hannah and make it clear that she's your date.  Unless you think it's already gone to far and she could attack Hannah.\n\nThis is so messed up", "If they wanted you to do this, they needed to ask you when they asked you to be a groomsman.

I hate this for you and her.\n\n>They told me I need to suck it up for a day because this will mean a lot to Lisa.\n\nI doubt it and so what? She is your friend's soon to be wife's sister. She has nothing to do with you. How is this even offered up as an excuse?", "Whoa WTF NTA\n\nThis is so horrifically twisted and makes me nauseated.  They just did all this behind your back and expected you to play along?

JFC", "NTA. No one should be a pretend boyfriend, I don't know what her family is thinking. This isn't kindness. This is deception.\n\nEven if you did go along with their foolishness, at some point, this girl's heart will break when she wonders why her boyfriend disappeared and never contacted her again. What if she contacts you on social media or gets ahold of your phone number? Just keep sucking it up? \n\nAsking the whole wedding party to make an extra effort to make her feel included throughout the day and make new friends is reasonable. Instead, this plan was hatched months ago, purposefully not inviting your girlfriend,  not telling you why, and putting this creepy expectation on you. Those are some top-tier shenanigans, and I'd avoid that wedding and that friendship.", "NTA. I\u2019d tell them either she gets to come or you\u2019re not going. That\u2019s an incredibly horrible thing to do. They\u2019re using you.", "Adios. NTA. No plus one for a member of the bridal party? I sympathize with their issue but to place it on your shoulders in this manner is unacceptable.", "NTA. I would not be okay with this at all what so ever in any way shape or form. Like hell nah!!!", "This is creepy as all get out. I strongly suggest you do not go to the wedding and lose the phone numbers of these people.", "NTA. This is absolutely ridiculous and disrespectful to you. Go have a nice dinner with your gf instead. It's not fair for them to not give you a plus one and even worst that's it's so you can be a pretend bf. Nope nope", "This is so crappy for all involved. I would give them a firm NO or drop out of the wedding. Even if you go through with this, after the wedding you obviously won\u2019t be Lisa\u2019s fake boyfriend anymore and that will probably upset her anyways. So either way this poor girl is going to be upset. This is the worst idea I have ever heard of.", "YWNBTA. \n\nThis is, at a minimum, cruel to Lisa, and rude to you and your GF. Worse: Lisa is a vulnerable adult. If she gets the wrong idea, tells her caregiver the wrong thing, or is inappropriate, it could cause you SERIOUS trouble. Do not tell her family this because they will probably flip shit. Just bow out \"sorry, not comfortable\" quietly.", "NTA but realize this might end your friendship with Kyle. \n\nWhat they are doing with Lisa is NOT kind to her. It\u2019s misguided.", "I work with special needs people, and they are not doing her any favors to lie to her. And it's unfair to you as well. Don't agree to this farce.

This will end in disaster if you go, hold strong, your instincts are right.", "I think first of all them wanting a friend to pretend to be her bf is not fair to her; I think them trying to manipulate you into it is not fair to you. The bride, her family, and the groom are all assholes. You WNBTA.", "YWNBTA.\n\nThese people suck. They are planning on using you, and disrespecting you, your girlfriend, and Lisa.", "NTA. What they are asking you to do is condescending and cruel. It's terrible that they want to basically lie to her. It's also really messed up that they made this decision plan and didn't even let you know it was a twisted kind of set up. You should drop out and tell them exactly why. The only people at fault here are the bride and groom who came up with this terrible and potentially hurtful scheme.", "NTA. One of the *actually* single guys can walk her down the aisle. \n\nEven then, that dude should *not* be pretending to be her boyfriend, what kind of weirdo shit is that. He should be nice to her of course but nice and single is different to pretending to be her boyfriend - that shit is cruel.\n\nEdit: spelling", "YWNBTA: I\u2019m guessing they are also asking you to be her caregiver during this event as well. Most likely you\u2019ll be responsible for her the entire wedding and reception after. This is not a what a friend does.

The audacity of them is astounding in my opinion and I\u2019m sorry you have to put up with childish behavior from your so called friend.", "NTA, but it would be hilarious if the single groomsman brought Hannah as his date.", "This is just weird", "Nta. This sucks more bcoz they probably never planned to tell you until the day of the wedding. You reasons are perfectly valid.", "NTA. Drop put. Where do these people come from", "YWNBTA\n\nThey didn't even bother to ask you about this. I could see a situation where they ask you nicely if you could be Lisa's 'date\" for the event - just being a dance partner and be nice to her so she can feel special on this day too. I'd put my foot down on anything even suggesting anything romantic. If they had put it to you that way, you guys might have been able to work out a deal. They didn't. You have no responsibility to be their gigolo.\n\nIt's just insulting all the way around and cruel.", "NTA - They are for playing this high school shit with someone's feelings, as well as you. They're toying with someone who is disabled. That's about as fucked as it can get, but they're also expecting you to go along with it. \n\nPersonally I would no longer be on speaking terms with someone who thinks this is even remotely okay to do. They're fucked up people.", "NTA. They put you in this situation because they knew you trusted there was a good reason for not being able to bring Hannah. Your friend sees you as gullible and a follower for whatever thing he will come up with next.

You deserve better.", "You would be NTA. That is pretty scummy of them. I have a disabled brother like their sister and he would rather know and I would rather be honest with him. Your points are valid.", "Yea, you would not be the AH. This is so cruel to do to this girl. It would actually be worse for this girl when you don't see her all the time.

First of all they never even asked you if your okay with this and it puts you in an extremely uncomfortable position.  My guess is they didn't come clean about it up front because they knew you might not be okay with it.  They just planned on springing it on you the day of the wedding.

Inexplicably not give a groomsman a +1 even though he is in a committed relationship and all the other groomsmen got +1s... and then expect him just not to notice.\n2. Plan an elaborate \"fake boyfriend\" narrative.\n3. NOT TELL THE MAIN PARTICIPANT IN THIS FALSE NARRATIVE THAT IT IS HAPPENING...like what was their plan?\n4.

This isn\u2019t your problem. It\u2019s actually cruel to do to her too. They\u2019re toying with her emotions and it\u2019s wrong on every level. You are not a toy. Fuck these people.

But I mean would you go on a tinder date to a wedding?", "Oh they know he\u2019ll notice, but it\u2019s Their Day and are counting on the fact he\u2019ll go along with it rather than cause a scene. Afterwards I guess they don\u2019t care if he stays their friend or not but probably think they can guilt him into not cutting them off. They sound exhausting and no one needs friends like this.

To give her a boyfriend experience on this day and afterward, she will be wondering what happened to him and why he isn't around anymore. It could also spiral into pushing OP to take her on a \"date\" to keep up the ruse and presumptuous of your buddy to think you would want to play into this.
