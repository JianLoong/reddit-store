I\u2019m the (co) maid of honor in her wedding. She\u2019s having this big beautiful, expensive fancy, 200+guest wedding that she has always dreamed of, and I\u2019m so happy for her. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 (30m) and I (26f) got engaged in April of 2023, and we decided we wanted to get married this summer. I spent a couple days looking into wedding things when we first got engaged, and I knew instantly that venues and lots of guests and planning a wedding for over a year was not what I wanted at all. So, we\u2019re going to have a small ceremony in a family members backyard, and then a dinner and drinks after with a dj at the house, with about 40-50 people. My parents are excited for both my sister and I, and although I want something really small and simple, my mom wants it to be nice and well put together. \n\nMy sister is really upset with me. She feels that I stabbed her in the back and betrayed her because I \u201cjumped\u201d her wedding, and \u201ccan\u2019t believe that of all the people in the world, I did this to her\u201d She believes that I should just get the marriage license signed because I don\u2019t care about having a big wedding, and shouldn\u2019t have a gathering afterwards. She says that to her it isn\u2019t about the actual marriage, its about the big celebration and the whole event that she has always wanted. She said that \u201cidk why it just couldn\u2019t have been next year.\u201d I said \u201cwe want to start a family\u201d and her response was \u201cand that\u2019s another thing that kept upsetting me. You\u2019re jumping me on my wedding day and then you\u2019ll probably be pregnant at my wedding\u201d\n\nI am really trying to consider and understand her feelings. But, I\u2019m having a really hard time because I feel as though she thinks I\u2019m not allowed to have any type of celebration because I never wanted a big wedding and she always has. \n\nA wedding has never been a big deal to me, it has always been about finding someone to love forever and have always wanted to have children. I don\u2019t like a lot of attention, the amount of people invited is already killing me. I know that there are more than enough women out there who are very passionate about their wedding day and the perfection of it. She and I are very different personalities and I\u2019m just having a hard time finding a way to understand exactly where she is coming from in being so upset with me.

If your wedding was, say, a month or a few weeks before hers I can see how she\u2019d have a valid complaint, but if you have your wedding this summer then there\u2019s what, eight months between yours and her wedding? How is that upstaging? After two years of planning, her wedding is going to be THAT unmemorable?\n\nYou know your sister, so hopefully you can tell if this is just her being worked up due to stress etc. or if she genuinely believes you\u2019re not allowed to have similar life events in the TWO WHOLE YEARS up to her wedding. Because if it\u2019s the second one, this is an issue that\u2019s probably going to come up again, and you might want to think about how much time and energy you can give to someone who\u2019s going to do that.", "No, she doesn't own dibs on matrimony. NTA. You do you.", "NTA. Your sister sounds too entitled", "Girl tell your sister sit the fuck down it is your day your wedding u the one that plan it if she don't like it fuck her basically OK u getting married before her so what I like how u said she said u should just go to court house and get paper cause u don't want big wedding that was funny maybe she should do that instead of her wedding it ur day ur dream wedding enjoy it do u and I hope u have a wonderful wedding and marriage God bless u and ur new husband I wish u joy and happiness", "NTA. Girl, this is your LIFE. Getting married and starting a family is about you and your spouse. It's absolutely not an affront to your sister, even if she thinks it is. For the love of God please don't change the timeline of your future because of her.", "NTA\u2026. Tell your little Sister It\u2019s time for her to Grow Up and start Adulting. Let her know she can do it\u2026 it\u2019s not too late. If she needs clarity, spell it for her \n\u201cA-D-U-L-T-I-N-G", "NTA. Your sister is acting pretty selfish and a bit childish. Getting married is not a contest.

Nope. Not how it works.", "Your baby sister has gone batshit crazy.

Clearly, marrying that young and insisting it\u2019s a big wedding, means she\u2019s not that mature. She doesn\u2019t care about the wedding but the celebration is important to her kind of shows her values and what she thinks of her future husband.", "I wonder if her future spouse knows she just wants a party and doesn\u2019t care about marriage\n\nNTA\u2026 were you supposed to wait two years? With her wedding next year you know she\u2019s not going to want you to steal her thunder by getting married the same year!\n\nShe\u2019s got serious main character syndrome and needs to get over herself", "NTA, your sister needs to get over herself. Congrats on your engagement!", "NTA. Your sister is being extremely selfish and immature. She sounds too immature to even marry at all IMO. \n\nIf she wants to keep arguing for dibs on life events you should point out that you were born first so she should really be waiting for you to get married and have kids first, lol.", "NTA.  Has your sister always been entitled?  If she has then it will be a miracle if her marriage lasts more than a few years, unless her future husband is a ballless wonder.", "NTA your sister though, wow.", "NTA, I feel like you've already been more than understanding enough.

Just because you wedding is small, and intimate does not mean it is a wedding.  If she keeps this up tell her since she does not see this as a wedding, she does not need to be there and uninvite her.   As for a baby, tell her that your bedroom life is not her business.", "NTA. Your life doesn't revolve around your sister's future wedding.", "NTA its not as if the wedding is the same month, its not even in the same year! your sister cant reserve 2 years", "NTA, and I would consider asking why she feels entitled to dictate the timeline of your life. Why are you only allowed to get married this year if you forego all forms of celebration and basically pretend it never happened? She won't have a good answer, but it will make it clear which one of you is being ridiculous.\n\nIf you want to go all in on the pettiness, which I would be sorely tempted to do...\n\n\"Oh no, sis! I had no idea that in spite of all the planning and expenses, you were so worried about your wedding that even a backyard affair would show it up. Do you want me to show you how you can make it dazzle a little more? I mean, if I'm able to plan something so small that can be such a threat, I must be able to share something. Do you have a DJ? Hmmm, what about a bartender? Oh, or you could always serve dinner, did you think of that? Don't worry, sis, I'm sure we can spruce up your party in no time!\"", "NTA She does realise that you are 3 years older than her so are more than entitled to get married and start a family whenever you want, it\u2019s not like she had dibs on it being an older sister or anything?!
