Every woman I know also does this. I\u2019ve also never known a man who didn\u2019t double check that they also had their wallets with the infamous pat down. Honestly your friend is right. Just because you\u2019ve known the owner for a long time doesn\u2019t mean you get to simply skip on paying the bill. It hurts the owner\u2019s business and makes you less trustworthy.

In other words, you forced him to leave a restaurant without paying\u2014something he\u2019s clearly not comfortable with. \n\nYour relationship with the owner is a complete side note.

You don\u2019t give your age, but if you\u2019re old enough to get there on your own, you\u2019re old enough to learn that the world is not your all inclusive resort.\n\nEdit: what did you do about tipping your waitstaff?

If it\u2019s such a hassle, these days at the least one can get a phone case that holds I.D.  & a card, or even have electronic payment methods in their phone. So what\u2019s the story?

If he's a good friend with your dad, you're pretty much family. He obviously didn't mind. Your friend making a big deal is beyond weird.

The end. LOL", "I go to the same corner bodega almost every day. The owner prefers cash for small things like coffee so I always try to pay in cash. Some times I forget to have any on me or used it all the night before, and whenever I try to swipe my card, the owner who sees me every day will tell me not to bother and just bring it the next day. So then the next day I go and pay for the day before with that coffee. It\u2019s really not that complicated, and happens everywhere.", "Then you should tell your friend it's your dad's treat.

You may not be affected by it, but your dad and the business certainly is. And since you bring up the fact that your dad pays for your card, you shouldn\u2019t be mooching off him. You\u2019re in college. I get that college is hard, but at this point, you should have a way to pay your own bills instead of relying on your dad.

I would feel awkward even if someone promised to tip the person days later. If you had perhaps presented at the beginning of the meal that hey, we are going to eat the meal here for free, perhaps the friend would not have been as taken aback. But to spring it on them at the end would have made me feel awkward...perhaps not to.the point of arguing about it, but I would have personally expressed that it made me feel some kind of way especially since I don't have the same type of relationship your family has with the owner.", "I mean, I\u2019m not the one driving. So having my license wouldn\u2019t matter in this situation? Besides, people misplace things. It happens.\n\nAs for my dad paying for my card, I also don\u2019t see why that is something that deep.

They never said it was their dads shout, just that their dad would pay.

If he's getting this worked up over this, causing a scene to embarass you, what's next?", "Who misplaces something as important as their wallet or cards? Wouldn\u2019t you be storming through every last place you had been to find it? Regarding your dad paying; just because his dad did doesn\u2019t mean you need to make your dad do it too. It doesn\u2019t mean he needs to. Expecting your dad to pay for everything because his daddy did (/s) is honestly really entitled.", "yeah, honestly I forgot my wallet one time, the magnitude of the comment makes it sound like I felt the nuclear codes laying around or something", "Yeah you absolutely can, but that\u2019s not a valid argument here. If OP has access to their card through a phone or watch, they could\u2019ve paid. Easily. I understand that people forget things, but not something as important as a wallet or even just a single card or cash when offering to pay for something.", "Sounds like he was on a weird power trip or something.. maybe not someone you want to hang with very often.

I\u2019ll definitely keep an eye out to see if anything else weird is up", "The point I\u2019m making isn\u2019t that I expect it, I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s not that out of the ordinary and doesn\u2019t lead to any major issues.\n\nAnd, I just don\u2019t see my wallet as *that* important?

Also is OPs dad wants to pay for his card, let him. It doesn\u2019t hurt you and honestly I think it\u2019s great that his dad is paying. College is hard and parents shouldn\u2019t give up supporting their children just because they turn 18. I think as long as OP isn\u2019t taking advantage of his fathers generosity, then this can be great for setting OP up financially after college.", "Mate, the amount of people that forget their keys, wallets, even bloody children is extremely large. \nA wallet isn\u2019t massively important on the scale of things, especially when you\u2019re going somewhere you grew up. \n\nAs I said, the reaction would be suited if he went to a local business they had never been.

A wallet, when you\u2019re saying you\u2019ll pay though, is honestly a huge thing. Especially in this case. If OP is right, and the owner doesn\u2019t want their dad to pay, it\u2019s a loss of money. The only person who benefits is their dad and OP. The business loses money. Which is why it\u2019s incredibly important to not mix friendship with business.", "The reason is that his close friend who he cares deeply about is our $40. Seems like a pretty compelling reason to pay it.\n\nAnd I will be, through my dad. So it\u2019s being paid either way", "I would lose my head if it wasn\u2019t attached to my body.
