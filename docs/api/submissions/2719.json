Why do you and your wife jump straight to screaming and banning people from the house just because a guest does something rude? Is there a lot of alcohol involved and are you being filmed for a reality TV show?\n\nUnless there's a major issue behind the scenes, like racism or theft or abuse, it's ridiculous for two grown adults to be having such a dramatic feud.

After multiple family members confronted me about the double standard, I did set some boundaries with my wife", "OP has some more information buried in comments that makes it clear the wife is also a problem in this relationship. To summarize: \n\n* OP's wife hates that his mom is introverted, and used to get angry at her for taking breaks during overwhelming social gatherings, telling her if she was going to come, she needed to socialize the whole time. (This additional context makes the wife's own crochet breaks, because \"her therapist told her she *also* needs a break,\" feel like possibly a weird passive-aggressive escalation?)\n\n* When the mom doesn't like the wife's cooking, the wife gets mad and calls her a picky toddler, but when the mom hosted a feast of the 7 fishes, OP's wife was theatrically gagging on the food in front of everyone because she doesn't like seafood.\n\n* OP's wife got angry at the mom for showing PDA with a guy she was seeing (a kiss), but then right after that, made a point of sitting on OP's lap in front of everyone. When the mom pointed out the hypocrisy, OP's wife told her she was just jealous and heavily implied she wanted to fuck her own son.\n\n* OP's wife has privately described to OP feeling irrational rage when she sees people liking OP's mom or wanting to sit near her or talk to her at social gatherings.\n\n* Multiple family members have approached OP asking him to please not let his wife be such a dick to his mom all the time.\n\nBringing glitter and resin into someone else's home is still an asshole move, but the context does show this to be yet one more battle in the petty war that they've been fighting, and that OP's wife has been doing plenty to feed and escalate herself. The wife also sounds like a huge asshole, to be quite honest.", "> Unless your mom is normally an avid maker of messes\n\nShe is but it is usually her own house. she is always getting paint and mud everywhere, refuses to clean it, but I've never cared as it was her house.

It is postpartum anxiety and some other stuff. She's even admitted it makes her irrationally angry to see how everyone likes my mom and wants to sit next to her. she doesn't want to just not see my family as she likes a lot of them. Also to be fair my mom previously had some anxiety during visits and we really werent nice to her about it and just told her to suck it up", "> Why is your wife so obsessed with your mom following etiquette? \n\nIt is just her personality and some control issues she is working on\n\n> How is she getting \"overwhelmed\" by a person you describe as introverted? \n\nMy mom is introverted but also has a strong personality a lot of people find unpleasant and it bothers my wife to watch everyone flock to her and treat her like she is so funny and cool when really she is kind of mean.\n\n> Why is your mom so theatrically offended by crocheting? \n\nBecause she knows she would get yelled at if she did the same thing, and we previously got pissy with her for trying to hide during family events.\n\n> Why do you and your wife jump straight to screaming and banning people from the house just because a guest does something rude?\n\nBecause resin stains and glitter is a pain in the ass to clean", "She didn't go out and buy this stuff to make a point. She is very into art and I'm sure has vats of this stuff. Her husband  \n probably did throw the glitter as she has previously thought it was   \ncute/funny to toss glitter or once paint at him while she was working.  You cannot diagnose someone with a personality disorder over the internet, and I absolutely took my wife's side here. I am just acknowledging she has had some rude moments in the past. I literally banned her, so there you go, that's your boundary", "Thank you for acknowledging the 'leave the room' piece. Everyone is glossing over that but it matters!", "Clearly you don't have anxiety. It does not make you an asshole to take a breather in another room when you're in overwhelming situations.", "My mom was cold in the beginning as she doesn't like change and is very slow to warm up to people. My wife took that badly. Then my mom met my MIL and they really got into it and some nasty things were said on both sides.My MIL kept implying my mom must be jealous that someone was stealing her son and my mom said some nasty things. At this point I think my mom was afraid of being alone and she responded by pushing me away and acting like she didn't even want me in her life. \n\nWe were hypocritical for a while.

If you work with resin it is highly recommended you use protective equipment.  Even the UV stuff can be toxic if mishandled.  Glitter, resin, and beads?  Mom brought that into OP's house.  If the resin cures good luck getting it out of your carpet. \n\nMom is definitely the bigger asshole in this scenario.  Crocheting doesn't leave a huge mess behind.", "Yarn doesn\u2019t make a mess. Glitter is the herpes of craft supplies.", "It 100% does matter what it is. One is something that doesn't take up space or make a mess. One is something that makes a HUGE mess.

I have friends and family who bring their knitting (or crocheting) to family events, pub quizzes, doctor's appointments, on public transit, etc. It keeps the hands busy and is productive. As far as I know it's a pretty normal thing to do.", ">It literally never occurred to me that could be perceived as rude or antisocial\n\nIt used to be that knitting, crocheting, tatting lace, using a drop spindle to spin yarn, etc were all considered to be *mainly* social hobbies, because you can all hang out together and work on whatever it is you're supposed to be finishing up for the family.

Personally I think it's rude to leave the room, but quite the opposite to do it while you're visiting. It shows your comfortable and content in their company, right? :)", "It sounds like the wife may be leaving the room to crochet. You\u2019re just keeping your hands busy while still engaged in the conversation, so I don\u2019t think most people would have a problem with that.\n\nI\u2019m an introvert with a very loud and intense extended family, so I get what she\u2019s doing and why.

It sounds like everything the mom has done has been a response. \n\nI think I get why the family is choosing the mom over the wife.", "!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Yeah, I don't know why I added that. It doesn't matter if she destroys her own home. Glitter, just by itself, is a WMD (weapon of mass decoration).", "Clearly she's not \"smart enough\" since she only did it to prove some pathetic point and make the maximum fuss, all while encouraging your uncle and aunt to gang up on your wife and try to shut you out of family gatherings.\n\nShe is toxic, and you should protect your wife.", "I know right, resin on their coffee table? If they didn't get some IPA on that soon as (which they probably didnt because most people dont keep it in the house) its gonna have to be totally refinished or thrown away. \n\nWhich really, his mum owes them for.", "Wow. Your mom is definitely in the wrong, but your wife is not necessarily in the right if she is goading your mom like that.", "So then there needs to be some compromise to your wife\u2019s behavior. This just sounds like a rock and a hard place for you. Your mother and wife are being quite immature.", "Actually I have GAD so I'm very familiar with taking a breather. Since OP doesn't mention anxiety, only an interpersonal conflict, then I assume his wife is overwhelmed with negative feelings as opposed to anxiety.

Because frankly at this stage they're fighting for the sake of fighting.", ">Glitter is the herpes of craft supplies.\n\nHAHAHAHAHAHA\n\nAlso, what the wife is doing is therapist-recommended.

But then I googled.  Thanks for the chuckle.", "Given that it's specifically mentioned this was an idea her therapist had, it's clear something is causing her significant distress.", "The Ale would be a better choice. Then if it doesn't work, you can drink it. And if you drink enough, you won't care that it didn't work to clean the coffee table. Win-win.", "He said \"our therapist.\"  That could be for anything. Sorry, I refuse to make assumptions about her mental health. I provide my judgement based only on what OP said. If someone does not have a significant mental health issue (which OP does not indicate), then I stand by my opinion that it's rude to go to a family event and sit in a room by yourself just because you don't get along with one person. OP himself even acknowledges this is poor manners, so...."]}
