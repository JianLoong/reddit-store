{"id": 19093, "submission_id": "141w1rg", "title": "AITA for not letting my dad drive my dream car?", "selftext": "I (28f) recently got a *dream* car of mine that I\u2019d been wanting for a long time. It\u2019s a daily driver for me, and words can\u2019t even describe how happy I am with it! It\u2019s been a few months already, and I still smile like an idiot when I drive it. I won\u2019t go into any specifics about the car itself, as it\u2019s easily identifiable. All I\u2019ll say is that it\u2019s a bright sky blue sports car. I\u2019ve put a lot of money into the car already aside from the price of the car itself. To name a few: custom wheels, new tires, mudflaps, full front end PPF, ceramic coating, and ceramic window tints. The price of the car, including the money I put into it is roughly $43,000.  \nMy dad hated the idea of this car before I bought one, but now he absolutely loves it. I always catch him watching videos of this car on YouTube. He\u2019s helped me with a few small things with the car (installing mudflaps, putting the new wheels on, etc). He has some mechanical knowledge too, so I don\u2019t mind letting him work on it if he offers. But keep in mind that I never have asked him to do anything, and I\u2019m more than fine with taking it to a local mechanic or dealership for maintenance that needs done. Regardless, I appreciate any help from him that I\u2019ve received.   \n\n\nIn the months I\u2019ve owned this car, things have been going good\u2026until today. I got home from getting my groceries and he comes outside and tells me to let him \u2018test drive\u2019 the car. I, assuming he was joking, replied \u201c*haha you\u2019re funny*\u201d. To that he responds \u201c*I\u2019m serious. I get to drive the car, or you\u2019re going to start paying $400 a month to park in the carport*\u201d (we have an enclosed 3 car carport). I responded again in a more serious tone \u201c***You\u2019re NOT driving my car***\u201d. He started grumbling under his breath as I walked away.   \n\n\nFor the record, The car is 100% mine, and no one else is on the title. I\u2019m on my own insurance plan alone for it too, and it\u2019s insured to the maximum amount. Dad and I have never been close. In fact, we used to not be able to be in the same room together without a fight breaking out. He is an absolute control freak, and it pisses him off that I won\u2019t bend to his will like my mother has. We have moments where we get along, but it\u2019s rare.   \n\n\nWhy on earth would he think he\u2019s entitled to drive my $43k car??? He drives things like that like an absolute maniac, and he doesn\u2019t take good care of ANY of his vehicles. I have no problems at all letting him ride along with me for some driving time, but that\u2019s apparently not good enough for him. Why should I let him mess up my car that I've worked hard for? I\u2019ve taken both of my keys and hidden them in my bedroom where he won\u2019t be able to find them. If he EVER manages to take my car without permission, I\u2019m going to report it as stolen. I don\u2019t care if he gets in trouble. I\u2019m so fed up with him and his entitlement.

On the other side though, I'm assuming that part of the reason you're able to afford this car is because you live at home. You seem baffled by why he's asking to drive it, but it's a very simple answer. He sees himself as at least partly contributing to it by housing you and also helping you with some of its maintenance. Does that entitle him to drive your car? That's up to you, but it's kind of funny you speak of his entitlement like the man is not housing you, your car, and helping you with its maintenance. \n\nIf the relationship is so poor you can barely stand him, a $43k car instead of finding your own place is a curious decision.

Keep the keys on you and maybe text him about not having permission to drive it. It sounds like he might take the keys because he thinks he knows best.", "If he is a bad/irresponsible driver, nah he could have bought her the car and I would still say no to him driving.", "Just because Dad let OP drive his car does not mean OP owes or is required to do the same. You don't do something for someone in expectation of something back. \n\nPerson A: \"Here I got this for you\" \nPerson B \"thanks so much\"\nPerson A: \"Why didn't you buy ME anything? I bought you ____ last time\" \n\nIs AH behavior. Just because dad may or may not said \"Hey you can drive my car\" doesn't mean OP now HAS to let their dad do the same. And if you think they do, then you are Person A, and therefore an AH.", "My thoughts too. If I had $43k lying around I'd be looking at houses and loans, not a car I'd be terrified to take anywhere for fear of it getting damaged. Or scratched by some asshole slamming their door into it.", "Not jealous, just questioning the OP's sense. Who buys such an expensive car when a home would have been a much better option.", "Rent around here can be as low as $400. If you paid $1,800 for rent around here, that would be VERY high end. Like the nicest apartment you could find. The kind where they have a 24hr gym, pool, laundry service. Your apartment each one has a patio/deck whatever they're called, with a dishwasher and a fridge 2 bedroom 2 bath and it's a big apartment. I mean just the nicest place. \n\nSo yeah think about location because not everyone pays $1,800 for a tiny studio apartment.", "And where I am, we paid the equivalent of $745 at today\u2019s exchange rate, pcm, for a three bedroom house with a garden and no problems besides the boiler being slightly old, in walking distance of the city centre which is also a world heritage site. Rents vary widely; you don\u2019t know where OP is.\n\nMore importantly, if she does the amount of work they agreed on as rent, then *she does a rent payment\u2019s worth of work*. If her parents wanted more rent or different rent then they should have asked for more. She is not \u201cmooching\u201d by doing the work they agreed on. The property she buys with the money she saves from working for her rent directly is not magically theirs just because other people elsewhere in different situations pay more. If your landlord wishes they had charged more rent they can raise the rent the next time the contract comes up. They can\u2019t demand your personal property and then add new charges to your rent if you refuse."]}
