I wouldn't let her go over there anymore. That's a  very violate situation  and I would be worried for your daughters safety if he tries to attack her next time.", "NTA. Andrea shouldn't have used a slur, but that's been dealt with. The fact Derrick and Shaun did nothing to address Tom's misbehaviour and focused solely on Andrea makes them TAs. Yes they absolutely should be compensating you for the laptop", "NTA. Good for you for sticking up for your daughter. I wouldn't make her go back to her dad's if she gets treated that way. Though what your daughter said was not nice, she was wronged and acted accordingly. \n\nThe son seems to have issues that need to be addressed. The dads need to step up and correct his behavior before it's too late.", "NTA.  Destroying a laptop is pretty extreme.   While your daughter's reaction was also a bit extreme, I can't blame her for getting a bit heated.  I think bio dad owes daughter an apology and step-brother owes her a new laptop.", "NTA\n\n\nYou punished your daughter Approperately and removed her from an abusive situation. I would go to court if there is a custody agreement and have yours changed to protect your daughter. \n\nTom and his fathers are wrong in how they are handling everything. i get they may have been triggered by the Slur used, but why did She get to the point she felt thst using the slur was the only way to get through. I have a feeling this is not the first time the Males have used their sexual orientation to Toms advantage and your daughter has been unfairly treated, this was the straw that broke the camels back", "NTA.\n\nYour\u2026.ex?\u2026.doesn\u2019t deserve time with his daughter. Way overboard and completely biased and unfair work on his part of \u201cparenting\u201d, if he is even allowed to call it that.", "NTA. \n\nShe was the only girl in the household with nobody speaking up for her. \n\nSure, she is wrong to use the slurs but both needed to be punished. If he gets away with it, there is no reason for her to be punished excessively. But you need to sit down with your daughter to tell her that her behaviour is unacceptable. \n\nI think it is right to not put your child where she does not feel safe. Her property was not theirs to damage and take away. I would report this to the police so that they have it on records.", "NTA\n\nLucky you got there before she went to school in dirty clothes that don't fit. CPS could step in to investigate for neglect or abuse. \n\nAlso its wrong to deprive kids of valid school supplies like a laptop.\n\nTom needs to repay the cost of the laptop and apologize for going into her bedroom. Thats a no.\n\nYour daughter needs to watch her language when angry. She does need punished for that. But it needs to be reasonable.  \n\nWearing dirty outgrown undies and shoes and losing something required for class isn't a valid punishment for anything .", "NTA - Tom sounds like he sucks. Your daughter also sucks. She\u2019s old enough to know not to use that word, especially directed at someone who is gay and already has to deal with the kinds of oppression that comes with being gay. That said, you\u2019re not the asshole (unless you\u2019re the one who taught her that it was okay to use that word). The way they punished her doesn\u2019t teach her anything\u2026when kids make mistakes they should be used as a teaching/learning opportunity. As long as you still talked to her about using that word, the problem isn\u2019t you. Even though Tom did something wrong, and should also be talked to about his behavior and replace the laptop and apologize to Andrea, your daughter still owes Tom, Derrick, and Shaun apologies.", "NTA\n\nThe punishments you have decided on seem fair and appropriate. The ones that Derrick and Shaun chose are totally inappropriate and frankly abusive. You handled this well.", "NTA, thank you for adding that edit. Your ex sounds like an idiot.", "NTA. There\u2019s no need for a parent to punish a child by withholding their clothes and making them wear uncomfortable clothes that are dirty and don\u2019t fit. That\u2019s a form of child abuse. Instead of punishing her like that they should have told her politely that isn\u2019t good using slurs in arguments as it\u2019s harmful behaviour. Additionally, they should tell her to apologize to Tom as that word carries a lot of history of oppression and discrimination against the LGBTQIA+ community. Then Tom should apologize since he destroyed her public property. Both children should be treated equally and should have learning opportunities to grow. \n\nAlso, why is you husband and his partner. Not making Tom get a punishment as well for destroying his step sister\u2019s property.\n\nDo you know if they are treating your daughter fairly in their household as you say  \n\u201cAndrea absolutely hates Tom as he is always messing with her and throws rage tantrums when something doesn\u2019t go his way\u201d. That sounds concerning are they always covering for Tom and letting Andrea get the short end of the stick.\n\nYou have to make her dad, his partner compensate her broken laptop and give back the newly purchased clothes and shoes you got for bought Andrea. You have to have a safe private discussion with your daughter to get to deeper root issue of what\u2019s happing in that household.", "NTA. You did the right thing. Your response to her behavior is proper and proportionate.", "NTA because it sounds like there is more going on in their household with such an extreme reaction to your daughter. If they had punished both children (him for going in her room and destroying her laptop) and her (for using a bigoted slur towards her stepbrother) it would be different. But the punishment not only didn\u2019t fit the crime but why was her stepbrother not punished for his actions? Is she being punished *because* she\u2019s a girl? \n\nAs the mother of teenagers myself, I would insist she sit down and right a letter of apology for the language she used. Including, why the use of a slur towards a family member is especially egregious. Then, I would discuss with her if she wants to return to their home or live with me full time. I don\u2019t know that I would ever be able to trust her father with making good decisions for her considering how he has reacted.", "NTA. You\u2019re punishing her in a way that isn\u2019t completely over the top and mildly abusive. You didn\u2019t run over there to coddle her, you went there to address the fact that her punishment includes wearing clothing that doesn\u2019t fit and might even hurt her and not being able to do her schoolwork. \n\nLook, it\u2019s a terrible slur she shouldn\u2019t have used, but she\u2019s a fucking teenager. They say stupid, screwed up things. She should be punished for that, and talked to very seriously about why that\u2019s not okay. But ignoring the fact that her laptop is permanently broken and taking HER clothes away (not even an item like a phone but her actual clothes) is extremely over the top. How is she ever supposed to feel secure in that environment?", "NTA. Because they didn\u2019t punished him at all and her punishment was going to far", "The only acceptable judgments are NTA or ESH I can see both but you are absolutely not TA for getting her out of there. She should not ever have to go to her fathers home again as he clearly doesn\u2019t respect her or love her", "NTA your ex and his husband punished your daughter because THEY took offense to her language. She definitely didn't have to use that word but she's still a kid so I won't hold it against her. I think your form of punishment was way more appropriate than her father's. It sounds like they are raising quite a little brat and they should absolutely be paying for a new laptop for her. Better yet their son should be working off payments for her laptop. He's 14 right? I had my first job at 14, might do him some good.", "NTA, and good job following through with consequences for her behavior. \n\nWhat they did to her was abusive.", "NTA. Tom is a dick and deserved to be yelled at. Honestly much more than that. He will now use his identity as a scapegoat to not get in trouble for breaking the laptop. The parents are teaching Tom that he can use is sexual identity to skirt getting in trouble for the shitty things he does to Andrea. Should she have used the slur? No. But do I understand wanting the person who harasses and torments you to feel pain, even if it is just emotional? Yes.", "NTA. While your daughter language needed to be addressed, it is clear that at that moment her dad's place was not a safe environment for her.", "NTA, accountability goes both ways.", "NTA. I mean, you had to pick her up, she doesn't have to be or dress homeless because she said a bad word. So, no, you are NTA for picking her up and taking her back home.\n\nUnfortunately, this would be a life lesson that if you are too mad or too rude, no one will care about your feelings or perspective and only care about what you said. \n\nMy advice would be that she should do what I do whenever I'm right. Be passive aggressively polite about it. \ud83d\ude0f Apologize to the Incredible Hulk who broke the laptop, be very adamant about it, \"OMG, are you okay? Do you want therapy? Does Dad need therapy? Family therapy for all of us.\" Ask Tom and Dad what could be done to make up for it at every possible opportunity, to the point that they are sick and tired of hearing about it. \n\nAnd punctuate that with asking Dad when is he going to pay for the laptop his little angel broke. Because that's all that matters. Getting the money. Words are meaningless, cheap garbage. Make them pay. \n\nWhen my ex-boyfriend cheated me out of $1,000, I was so blessedly kind to him that his aunt paid what he owed behind his back. The idiot thought I'd forgiven him and was considering getting back together.  Being rude or hostile won't actually solve anything because people will ignore absolutely anything to avoid admitting fault to someone that's unlikable. Not to mention, that even if you apologize once and wait patiently for their hurt feelings to pass, they will make them linger longer out of a self-righteous demand for sympathy. I've always found that people jump to get over things faster if you make a bigger deal out of it than they do, because as much as people want sympathy, they also don't want to feel babied.", "Soft NTA\nYou are punishing your daughter with a 2 week grounding. As long as it is a thorough grounding that you stick with, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s enabling her. She needs to understand using slurs is not acceptable EVER. \nIt also sounds like the step brother needs to learn to respect other people\u2019s things but he did not deserve to be called a slur AT ALL. I don\u2019t blame you for taking your daughter back, her father has not stopped the step brother\u2019s behavior. He should know better than to invade your daughter\u2019s privacy and destroy her things.", "Info\u2014 what consequences did you give her?", "NTA for pulling your daughter out of there.  \nI don't know if she's a homophobe or not.  \nYou need to do some serious intervention.", "NTA Honestly I despise men like Tom for not being able to control their temper like oh my god GET A GRIP. I swear to god. In my opinion I don't think she should ever see her father again if she chooses to. Yes, I do understand that saying the F word is bad but seriously? Forcing Andrea to wear old clothing that didn't even fit her? Tom ruined her laptop. The dad is some sicko fucking freak and honestly you could report Ton for property damage (the laptop) and sue the dad for child abuse (the clothing situation). NTA", "ESH - making your daughter wear clothes that no longer fit her is not an acceptable punishment, it may even be abuse.

Maybe we are missing some info and Tom was actually punished for smashing the laptop? Perhaps they were triggered because of the particular word that was used. \n\nYou - I guess you sucked the least. At face value, you removed your daughter from a toxic situation, but you also aren\u2019t teaching her how to resolve conflicts very well.  Also, threatening Derrick with how your daughter might cut ties with him over this is a bit extreme. Sounds like you talked to your daughter about using slurs, so props there.", "ESH. Slurs are never okay to use obviously. I do think some sort of punishment is warranted, but not the extent her father took it. They absolutely need to pay for the laptop. They need to get Tom some help if he doesn't already receive it. Everyone needs a break. Let your daughter stay home with you. She may benefit from family therapy with her dad and his family.

Did you confirm that the laptop was broken?

Not only that, but if your daughter thinks that about her step brother then I'd bet money she feels the same about dad and step dad - and they have probably come to that conclusion too.\n\nEdit - from the further info you have done more than just had a conversation with her. Would be curious to know what your daughters logic was around using that word. Has Tom had any consequence for his actions?", "ESH, it sounds like both Dads are being less harsh on Tom for one reason or another. it also does sound like you may have some internalized homophobia you may or may not be aware of, and I wonder if it is rubbing off of your daughter and showing in their home (in which it would be glaringly obvious because of the contrasting situations). They were also totally wrong for 1. not punishing Tom for his actions 2. allowing it to escalate the way it did (assuming they were there) and 3. their punishment choice for Andrea. \n\nHopefully I\u2019m incorrect, but I\u2019d assume this goes deeper than just this 1 issue. Once things settle, hopefully you can begin to connect with the dads and come to more of an understanding with eachother in able to coparent your daughter better. I\u2019d imagine due to the depths of the situations and length of time this has been ongoing, it would be best to be guided by a counsellor. Best of luck!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Go ahead do it!", "He has a use for those words?", "That's bar fights. Look online you see women hitting men or getting violent all the time with no consequence. Everywhere you look women get violent with men because they know they won't be held accountable. Men on the other hand get shame and have consequences for just getting pissed or look like they might retaliate to a woman hitting them repeatedly. \n\nThe reason women are so much less in crimes is because they aren't held accountable. I've seen women walk up and punch men as hard as they could in front of cops and the cops get onto the guy for not backing away from the woman immediately.", "I will do it because I know I am better.

Your daughter can fairly say she feels unsafe in her dad's home due to his stepson's atrocious behaviour.  The idea that they think they can just take all her belongings as a punishment-- including clothes and UNDERWEAR-- is just ridiculous.\n\nYes, she should not have used a slur-- particularly that one, which was extremely harmful to her father and his partner.  But here's the thing-- she is a child, and can be expected to react emotionally to violence-- yes, this was violence.

What she said was wrong, sure, but I'm wondering if their enabling their son's bullying is making her resent the gay community (or at least not respect them). I mean, if you're showing signs of homophobia and you're being abused by your dads (taking away a growing woman's bra is abuse and sexist at that), I can see some cause and effect happening. Get her counseling and maybe have her volunteer at the next pride parade. Maybe she'll meet some people in that community who respect women, and she'll be more inclined to respect them too. Of course she probably just said the most hurtful thing she could think of in that moment either way NTA", "NTA.\n\nHer punishment was over the top and not going to educate or correct her behavior.

I\u2019m fact, some police/judges might even say the offender shouldn\u2019t have destroyed the victims property if he didn\u2019t want the victim to react badly since you can\u2019t always predict how victims will react to being victimized.  \n\nThe police &/or judge won\u2019t \u201cexcuse\u201d the offender\u2019s crime because the victim called him a slur.

If I was a parent I'd get to the bottom of it because it feels like she's possibly misplacing her anger at her dads and brother behavior towards them being gay, which is making her say/do homophobic things. \n\n\nFrankly I haven't mentioned the dads or the brother because like... obviously they're in the wrong to an extreme degree that makes me skeptical of the post, but the fact that a kid in 2023 is hurling slurs as a form of retaliation is something that needs to be quashed immediately and shouldn't be handwaved as \"She was backed into a corner, it was a natural response\", since it's *not* a natural response unless it's language she hears used regularly.", "What you did definitely shouldn\u2019t have been called misogynistic but op\u2019s teenage daughter was in a house full of males and only the male child gets off Scott free for bad behaviors. They\u2019re either favoring him because he\u2019s male or because he\u2019s also gay.", "Never said that the kid should get off Scott free. In fact he should be punished heavily for that I mean breaking stuff is bad in general but breaking a laptop that she uses for school work? That's a triple bad your an asshole move. The parents of the kid suck so much as well, and I sincerely hope that OP starts looking at possible legal options to legally limit the time that her daughter has to go there. That being said my main point remains. These days, especially on the internet when someone says something that could be viewed in a negative light against a woman,even if it has absolutely nothing to do with her gender, for example if someone says \"she is absolutely shit at her job\" someone screams \"MISOGYNY!\" at the top of their lungs. It's became a go to response for anything that is viewed as \"bad\" in regards to women, when all it could be is the person saying it was just being a bit of a dick.", "Taking away cloths needed to support her female anatomy is misogynistic, they\u2019re taking away necessities from her specific to her body as a girl when they wouldn\u2019t do that to the son. Also, when you\u2019re only a \u201cdick\u201d to the only girl in you\u2019re house/family, it seems like misogyny. Well it is factually, but it seems like it\u2019s coming from a place of hate, conscious or unconscious, and not just cause you\u2019re \u201cjust a dick\u201d, and it just so happens that you only are to women.", "You know it\u2019s misogyny when the misogynists start gatekeeping the term misogyny while simultaneously claiming they\u2019re not misogynists. Deny something is misogynistic, therefore when they engage in that very thing they\u2019re not being a misogynist. The transparency would be risible if it didn\u2019t have such damning real world implications.", "I was not specifically saying that about that in this case for crying out loud. I meant to say \"in general\" as not for a specific situation. In this case yes there is clearly more than someone being a dick. But in general, in life my point stays the same. You might not like a woman because of a specific reason, you don't like her attitude towards work, you don't like how she treats someone you care about etc.but the minute you open your mouth and say about it the chances of you being deemed sexist and misogynistic rise very very rapidly."]}
