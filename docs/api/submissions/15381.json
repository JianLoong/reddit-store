I wouldn't let her go over there anymore. That's a  very violate situation  and I would be worried for your daughters safety if he tries to attack her next time.", "NTA. Andrea shouldn't have used a slur, but that's been dealt with. The fact Derrick and Shaun did nothing to address Tom's misbehaviour and focused solely on Andrea makes them TAs. Yes they absolutely should be compensating you for the laptop", "NTA. Good for you for sticking up for your daughter. I wouldn't make her go back to her dad's if she gets treated that way. Though what your daughter said was not nice, she was wronged and acted accordingly. \n\nThe son seems to have issues that need to be addressed. The dads need to step up and correct his behavior before it's too late.", "NTA.  Destroying a laptop is pretty extreme.   While your daughter's reaction was also a bit extreme, I can't blame her for getting a bit heated.  I think bio dad owes daughter an apology and step-brother owes her a new laptop.", "NTA\n\n\nYou punished your daughter Approperately and removed her from an abusive situation. I would go to court if there is a custody agreement and have yours changed to protect your daughter. \n\nTom and his fathers are wrong in how they are handling everything. i get they may have been triggered by the Slur used, but why did She get to the point she felt thst using the slur was the only way to get through. I have a feeling this is not the first time the Males have used their sexual orientation to Toms advantage and your daughter has been unfairly treated, this was the straw that broke the camels back", "NTA.\n\nYour\u2026.ex?\u2026.doesn\u2019t deserve time with his daughter. Way overboard and completely biased and unfair work on his part of \u201cparenting\u201d, if he is even allowed to call it that.", "NTA. \n\nShe was the only girl in the household with nobody speaking up for her. \n\nSure, she is wrong to use the slurs but both needed to be punished. If he gets away with it, there is no reason for her to be punished excessively. But you need to sit down with your daughter to tell her that her behaviour is unacceptable. \n\nI think it is right to not put your child where she does not feel safe. Her property was not theirs to damage and take away. I would report this to the police so that they have it on records.", "NTA\n\nLucky you got there before she went to school in dirty clothes that don't fit. CPS could step in to investigate for neglect or abuse. \n\nAlso its wrong to deprive kids of valid school supplies like a laptop.\n\nTom needs to repay the cost of the laptop and apologize for going into her bedroom. Thats a no.\n\nYour daughter needs to watch her language when angry. She does need punished for that. But it needs to be reasonable.  \n\nWearing dirty outgrown undies and shoes and losing something required for class isn't a valid punishment for anything .", "NTA - Tom sounds like he sucks. Your daughter also sucks. She\u2019s old enough to know not to use that word, especially directed at someone who is gay and already has to deal with the kinds of oppression that comes with being gay. That said, you\u2019re not the asshole (unless you\u2019re the one who taught her that it was okay to use that word). The way they punished her doesn\u2019t teach her anything\u2026when kids make mistakes they should be used as a teaching/learning opportunity. As long as you still talked to her about using that word, the problem isn\u2019t you. Even though Tom did something wrong, and should also be talked to about his behavior and replace the laptop and apologize to Andrea, your daughter still owes Tom, Derrick, and Shaun apologies.", "NTA\n\nThe punishments you have decided on seem fair and appropriate. The ones that Derrick and Shaun chose are totally inappropriate and frankly abusive. You handled this well.", "NTA, thank you for adding that edit. Your ex sounds like an idiot.", "NTA. There\u2019s no need for a parent to punish a child by withholding their clothes and making them wear uncomfortable clothes that are dirty and don\u2019t fit. That\u2019s a form of child abuse. Instead of punishing her like that they should have told her politely that isn\u2019t good using slurs in arguments as it\u2019s harmful behaviour. Additionally, they should tell her to apologize to Tom as that word carries a lot of history of oppression and discrimination against the LGBTQIA+ community. Then Tom should apologize since he destroyed her public property. Both children should be treated equally and should have learning opportunities to grow. \n\nAlso, why is you husband and his partner. Not making Tom get a punishment as well for destroying his step sister\u2019s property.\n\nDo you know if they are treating your daughter fairly in their household as you say  \n\u201cAndrea absolutely hates Tom as he is always messing with her and throws rage tantrums when something doesn\u2019t go his way\u201d. That sounds concerning are they always covering for Tom and letting Andrea get the short end of the stick.\n\nYou have to make her dad, his partner compensate her broken laptop and give back the newly purchased clothes and shoes you got for bought Andrea. You have to have a safe private discussion with your daughter to get to deeper root issue of what\u2019s happing in that household.", "NTA. You did the right thing. Your response to her behavior is proper and proportionate.", "NTA because it sounds like there is more going on in their household with such an extreme reaction to your daughter. If they had punished both children (him for going in her room and destroying her laptop) and her (for using a bigoted slur towards her stepbrother) it would be different. But the punishment not only didn\u2019t fit the crime but why was her stepbrother not punished for his actions? Is she being punished *because* she\u2019s a girl? \n\nAs the mother of teenagers myself, I would insist she sit down and right a letter of apology for the language she used. Including, why the use of a slur towards a family member is especially egregious. Then, I would discuss with her if she wants to return to their home or live with me full time. I don\u2019t know that I would ever be able to trust her father with making good decisions for her considering how he has reacted.", "NTA. You\u2019re punishing her in a way that isn\u2019t completely over the top and mildly abusive. You didn\u2019t run over there to coddle her, you went there to address the fact that her punishment includes wearing clothing that doesn\u2019t fit and might even hurt her and not being able to do her schoolwork. \n\nLook, it\u2019s a terrible slur she shouldn\u2019t have used, but she\u2019s a fucking teenager. They say stupid, screwed up things. She should be punished for that, and talked to very seriously about why that\u2019s not okay. But ignoring the fact that her laptop is permanently broken and taking HER clothes away (not even an item like a phone but her actual clothes) is extremely over the top. How is she ever supposed to feel secure in that environment?", "NTA. Because they didn\u2019t punished him at all and her punishment was going to far", "The only acceptable judgments are NTA or ESH I can see both but you are absolutely not TA for getting her out of there. She should not ever have to go to her fathers home again as he clearly doesn\u2019t respect her or love her", "NTA your ex and his husband punished your daughter because THEY took offense to her language. She definitely didn't have to use that word but she's still a kid so I won't hold it against her. I think your form of punishment was way more appropriate than her father's. It sounds like they are raising quite a little brat and they should absolutely be paying for a new laptop for her. Better yet their son should be working off payments for her laptop. He's 14 right? I had my first job at 14, might do him some good.", "NTA, and good job following through with consequences for her behavior. \n\nWhat they did to her was abusive.", "NTA. Tom is a dick and deserved to be yelled at. Honestly much more than that. He will now use his identity as a scapegoat to not get in trouble for breaking the laptop. The parents are teaching Tom that he can use is sexual identity to skirt getting in trouble for the shitty things he does to Andrea. Should she have used the slur? No. But do I understand wanting the person who harasses and torments you to feel pain, even if it is just emotional? Yes.", "NTA. While your daughter language needed to be addressed, it is clear that at that moment her dad's place was not a safe environment for her.", "NTA, accountability goes both ways.", "NTA. I mean, you had to pick her up, she doesn't have to be or dress homeless because she said a bad word. So, no, you are NTA for picking her up and taking her back home.\n\nUnfortunately, this would be a life lesson that if you are too mad or too rude, no one will care about your feelings or perspective and only care about what you said. \n\nMy advice would be that she should do what I do whenever I'm right. Be passive aggressively polite about it. \ud83d\ude0f Apologize to the Incredible Hulk who broke the laptop, be very adamant about it, \"OMG, are you okay? Do you want therapy? Does Dad need therapy? Family therapy for all of us.\" Ask Tom and Dad what could be done to make up for it at every possible opportunity, to the point that they are sick and tired of hearing about it. \n\nAnd punctuate that with asking Dad when is he going to pay for the laptop his little angel broke. Because that's all that matters. Getting the money. Words are meaningless, cheap garbage. Make them pay. \n\nWhen my ex-boyfriend cheated me out of $1,000, I was so blessedly kind to him that his aunt paid what he owed behind his back. The idiot thought I'd forgiven him and was considering getting back together.  Being rude or hostile won't actually solve anything because people will ignore absolutely anything to avoid admitting fault to someone that's unlikable. Not to mention, that even if you apologize once and wait patiently for their hurt feelings to pass, they will make them linger longer out of a self-righteous demand for sympathy. I've always found that people jump to get over things faster if you make a bigger deal out of it than they do, because as much as people want sympathy, they also don't want to feel babied.", "Soft NTA\nYou are punishing your daughter with a 2 week grounding. As long as it is a thorough grounding that you stick with, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s enabling her. She needs to understand using slurs is not acceptable EVER. \nIt also sounds like the step brother needs to learn to respect other people\u2019s things but he did not deserve to be called a slur AT ALL. I don\u2019t blame you for taking your daughter back, her father has not stopped the step brother\u2019s behavior. He should know better than to invade your daughter\u2019s privacy and destroy her things.", "Info\u2014 what consequences did you give her?", "NTA for pulling your daughter out of there.  \nI don't know if she's a homophobe or not.  \nYou need to do some serious intervention.", "NTA Honestly I despise men like Tom for not being able to control their temper like oh my god GET A GRIP. I swear to god. In my opinion I don't think she should ever see her father again if she chooses to. Yes, I do understand that saying the F word is bad but seriously? Forcing Andrea to wear old clothing that didn't even fit her? Tom ruined her laptop. The dad is some sicko fucking freak and honestly you could report Ton for property damage (the laptop) and sue the dad for child abuse (the clothing situation). NTA", "ESH - making your daughter wear clothes that no longer fit her is not an acceptable punishment, it may even be abuse.

Maybe we are missing some info and Tom was actually punished for smashing the laptop? Perhaps they were triggered because of the particular word that was used. \n\nYou - I guess you sucked the least. At face value, you removed your daughter from a toxic situation, but you also aren\u2019t teaching her how to resolve conflicts very well.  Also, threatening Derrick with how your daughter might cut ties with him over this is a bit extreme. Sounds like you talked to your daughter about using slurs, so props there.", "ESH. Slurs are never okay to use obviously. I do think some sort of punishment is warranted, but not the extent her father took it. They absolutely need to pay for the laptop. They need to get Tom some help if he doesn't already receive it. Everyone needs a break. Let your daughter stay home with you. She may benefit from family therapy with her dad and his family.

Not only that, but if your daughter thinks that about her step brother then I'd bet money she feels the same about dad and step dad - and they have probably come to that conclusion too.", "ESH, it sounds like both Dads are being less harsh on Tom for one reason or another. it also does sound like you may have some internalized homophobia you may or may not be aware of, and I wonder if it is rubbing off of your daughter and showing in their home (in which it would be glaringly obvious because of the contrasting situations). They were also totally wrong for 1. not punishing Tom for his actions 2. allowing it to escalate the way it did (assuming they were there) and 3. their punishment choice for Andrea. \n\nHopefully I\u2019m incorrect, but I\u2019d assume this goes deeper than just this 1 issue. Once things settle, hopefully you can begin to connect with the dads and come to more of an understanding with eachother in able to coparent your daughter better.

Sorry for pissing off your overinflated ego but most boys and girls know that for breaking something on purpose of someone else's they are going to get punished its not fucking excused. You can talk and yell at me for being \"sexist\" all you want but it won't change the fact that i'm not. \"There was not sexism in my comment. I'm simply stating the fact that most of the people who flip out violently in my experience have been women.\" Mhm being sexist there go ahead and act that you are soooo much better than me. Go ahead do it!", "He has a use for those words?", "That's bar fights. Look online you see women hitting men or getting violent all the time with no consequence. Everywhere you look women get violent with men because they know they won't be held accountable. Men on the other hand get shame and have consequences for just getting pissed or look like they might retaliate to a woman hitting them repeatedly. \n\nThe reason women are so much less in crimes is because they aren't held accountable. I've seen women walk up and punch men as hard as they could in front of cops and the cops get onto the guy for not backing away from the woman immediately.", "I will do it because I know I am better. You stated in the beginning that you hate \"Men like Tom\" as if it was inherently because he is male. Sexism is hate or discrimination based on gender. Stating facts is not hate or discrimination.", "Yea he says that slur often as well as Tom and Shaun.", "It's not uncommon in the community.", "All i've seen from you posting is \"Women this women that\" All I put was \"Men like Tom\" See how I put nothing else about men? What would it have been better if I would have said \"People like Tom\" just to spare your poor hurt feelings?", "Oh definitely NTA. They all use it but she couldn't. You need to edit your post", "People like Tom would have been better as to not be sexist. All I am doing is retorting your sexist words with facts from reality showing you that your view isn't correct. Deal with it.", "\"Deal with it\" Okay then deal with your view of women somewhere else. Its Ironic that you a talking shit about women in one thread yet you stand over here getting pissy at 3 words. Want a pacifier? Maybe it'll help calm you down.", "how is it sexist? its a singular word to describe a person's gender. just because she used a slightly less broad term than \"people\" doesn't mean she's sexist. clearly she has had similar past experiences with men as this one, as well as many other women. she never said something actually sexist like \"men suck\" or some bullshit. the definition of being sexist is to use stereotypes or insults to make someone feel bad about their gender, and i don't see how those 3 words fit that definition. also, facts from reality showing her that her view isn't correct? are you serious? what kind of mature person would have an entire argument online about one singular word. we live in a society.", "Shut up you talk down about men but get pissed when someone states facts about women. You white knight no one is gonna fuck you because of you white knighting.", "the other person is a man. And it is more subtle than direct. \n\nQuite astute of you to think we live in a society. A baselevel observation like that is what I can expect from you. Very good. Hope you improve in the future."]}
