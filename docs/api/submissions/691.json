You should have talked to your wife first, but she should be understanding of your desire to help your parents.", "I think to allow them to come back and monitor your parent's actions.

Sounds like that's the real problem here.", "YTA\n\nYou invited your parents when she hadn't agreed to the plan. You don't just invite family to live with you when your wife hasn't agreed, especially if she's pregnant and they already struggle to get along. This poor woman.", "NAH.  Assuming that what you meant a by \"after talking with my wife\" is you and your wife agreed on this course of action.  But you are not an asshole for offering, and your wife is not an asshole for being stressed about having in-laws she doesn't get along with as long term houseguests.  Don't just leave it at telling your parents they have only until the baby comes to find something else.  Actively help them make a plan and find an alternative.  Neither you nor your wife will like the stress of the due date getting closer and your guests still with no plans to move out", "We talked about it several days before offering. She did not yes but she also did not say no.", "That is a great question. I have never really figured out why. My family has not said anything mean to her.
