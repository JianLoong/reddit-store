My mom (51f) called me yesterday morning as I was getting my son ready school and asked if I would go with her to  view a wedding venue. I agreed she then asked if she likes it will I help and put money down for the deposit. I was taken aback at first. I\u2019m not very good at saying no and I have a feeling that\u2019s why she asked me but also I\u2019m not in the financial position to help anyone especially when I receive no help as a single parent and full time student. I know giving isn\u2019t a tit for tat thing but when I have asked for her help in the past (never financially help, often it\u2019s looking after my son so I can go to class) she\u2019s either said no or if she does say yes she\u2019ll continuously call me asking me when I\u2019m coming back when we had already went over it before I dropped him off. When thinking about it I think I\u2019m more upset as my younger sister is also in college and my mom will continually tell me she gets no help financially and she struggles so much in college but the same grace or thought isn\u2019t given to me. I\u2019m still expected to help her whenever. This isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s asked for money but it\u2019s the first time it\u2019s been this amount.

Wedding budget is her responsibility not yours.", "NTA you and your child\u2019s financial well-being  comes first. Your 51yo mum can downsize her venue if it\u2019s out of her budget, she should be able to recognise that at her big age. stand your ground and don\u2019t let her guilt you into it.", "I know it's hard for you to say \"no,\" but this is an excellent situation for you to practice. Your mother is using you and being ridiculous. You would not be TA for not helping her with this. You need to grow a backbone, if for no other reason, than to protect your son. If you give your mother this money, you are putting your son and yourself in a precarious financial situation. Do NOT do this.", "NTA, you have a lot of financial responsibilities, your mom\u2019s wedding isn\u2019t one of them. A courthouse wedding is just as good if she can\u2019t afford her wedding.", "NTA.\n\nYou have WAY more pressing obligations.  Seems like this wedding is not even agreed to by your mom's fiance from your comment?  Double NTA.", "NTA, literally how dare she?\n\nThis \"no\" will be hard, and she will punish you for it emotionally and socially. But just...stay real with her, stay real with yourself, and prioritize taking care of your own well-being and peace of mind (doing so is usually a wildly effective and powerful buffer against demands and expectations, and people start treating you differently and with more respect and even liking you more once you establish the pattern of behavior. People-pleasers are usually surprised at how much people like them more when they start standing up for themselves).\n\nedit: not that your mom will necessarily like you more, just the feedback you get from the world in general will start to change", "NTA. And remember this, family can be toxic too.", "NTA. She needs to find a venue she and her SO can afford.\n\nWhy do you have more money than your mom anyway?", "NTA and say no. You're a young single parent and she's over 50, she should be able to pay for her own damn wedding. If she can't afford her preferred venue or anything else for her wedding, that means it's time for her to lower her sights and start making plans that she can afford.\n\nAnd you know that if you put down this deposit you're never getting that money back.", "NTA this is so backwards. Parents sometimes help their kids with a wedding. A parent asking a child to fund their wedding is shameful.\n\nIf she can't afford a big wedding there are PLENTY of ways to do a smaller and still very tasteful wedding without spending boat loads of cash.\n\nYou have a kid to plan for, it doesn't sound like you really have the cash to begin with so please don't do it. If your mom really wants money give her 100 dollars as a wedding gift ahead of time. That would be the absolute maximum I would give her. \n\nBut even still I'd be so ashamed take money from my kids.", "You don't need to be irritated.  As a single parent in school you just cannot afford to spend money that way.  Your mother should look at venues that she can afford.", "You are single mom and your 51 year old mother is trying to take money from you for a wedding venue? I would not be accompanying her nor would I would be speaking to her any time soon. \n\nYour mom isn't even engaged!!!! You need to take a break from her. Do not give her your money! NTA.", "Nta. You have to take care of your child and schooling needs.", "NTA and you owe it to your daughter and more importantly to yourself to learn how to say no.", "You misses a good opportunity to laugh in her face when she asked that. I guess when she presses on, you can tell her sure, you\u2019ll sell your summer house and wire her the funds. NTA", "**NTA**\n\nI'm around your mum's age and appalled that she would even ask. You are a young single mother; your ONLY responsibility and priority is to your own household. Period.\n\nIf your mother were ill, or struggling to keep a roof over her head or food on the table, that might be a different situation. But there is no world in which you are required to help her pay for her WEDDING at the age of 51. None. This is a joyous but entirely voluntary occasion, and she is an adult. If she cannot afford something for her event, then she needs to make alternate arrangements. None of this is yours to worry about, honey. Honestly, it's a bit disgusting that she would even ask.\n\nTake it from someone else old enough to be your mum: you are definitely NTA.", "Absolutely YTA if you agree.
