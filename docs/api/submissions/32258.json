We lived just a few minutes of walk away form each other so we started spending time togehter often as new moms doing it for the first time.\n\nOur sons are just 1 month apart. We also hang out with out husbands and kids and we love their company! \n\nThe issue is that I strongly think their son is autistic.. nothing wrong with that, but they never mention it and I believe they don\u2019t act and respond to him as you should to a autistic 4y/o. When he hits another kid (like mine) out of the blue they Will shame him, raise their voice and make him apologize. It is kind of an elephant in the room when we hangout.\n\nWhy I think he is autistic? He is very picky with his food, he is not that social, he seems to have issues talking (both pronauncing and knowing the words), he bites when angry, cries often and Will shake his hands (kind of stimming) and he Will randomly attack other kids and claw at them or bite them. Also, when he plays he rather play alone and play for him is sorting his toys, like placing all animals we got for his birthday on a straight line then push them over and repeat.\n\nSo they never say anything about him possibly being autistic, we hangout often and I feel they go to hard on him when he \u201dacts out\u201d. (Being a normal autistic child that is overstimulated)\n\nWe were at their name givning ceremony last week for their newborn and he was carried into the church crying and saying he did not want to be there.

Seems like you could be right. \n\nHowever, please be careful with your wording. Don't diagnose, rather ask if this is something they have looked into/has their GP ever mentioned anything like it?\n\nHonestly, I would have LOVED for my parents to know what was going on with me. Instead, I was labelled difficult and attention seeking and did not get any help. I managed but at what cost to me and to us as a family. A label would have been bloody helpful.", "NTA but be incredibly careful how you bring it up.

It is not the horrible disability many people view it as, he may benefit from specialised help", "I can\u2019t believe people are suggesting looking the other way - whatever happened to prioritising the well-being of the child? If the parents are made aware of the potential their son is neurodiverse he has a much better chance of a happy childhood, since they\u2019ll be able to use appropriate means to respond to his behaviour. The alternative is he potentially spends years being yelled at and blamed, doing less well than he could do in school because his teachers don\u2019t know what support he needs to maximise his potential, and all of this will have a lifelong impact. He needs help, and ASAP.\n\nThere are ways of broaching subjects that are less likely to upset the parents,and they may even be grateful to know their son isn\u2019t \u201cbad\u201d, or that they aren\u2019t \u201cbad\u201d parents.", "NTA. But be carefull. Try not hurt and make clear it's not a problem for you. Just suggest a profesional could help him improve his social skills for example", "YWBTA. I'm a teacher and because we see hundreds of kiddos, we start to recognize when a kid might have a disability... But we're not doctors and have no business diagnosing anyone. Here's the magic words to say instead: when the mom is venting to you about the kids bad behavior, you say, \"have you talked to his pediatrician about it? My pediatrician said I should come to her if Kiddo's behavior is having a big negative impact on his life. It could just be growing pains but it could also be something they can help him with.\"\n\nAlso a lot of times parents know the kid has autism but they don't want to tell other people and spread his business. Or they know but think the kid is not severely impacted enough to seek diagnosis, or they know but don't want a diagnosis on his record. He's just a little guy but he does have a right to privacy.\n\nETA: YES, if I think a child has autism (ADHD, depression, etc), I absolutely refer them on to the appropriate staff at the school like counselors and school psychs, who will look into it further and ARE allowed to tell parents their kids needs to be tested. I'm not just watching kids flail around when I think they need medical attention. As a teacher I'm not even ALLOWED to tell a parent I think their kid has a medical condition. Since the pandemic I've supported DOZENS of older students getting new diagnoses and IEPs/504s that should have been caught when they were younger.", "YWNBTA. I\u2019m autistic, and my mom suspected that some people tried to hint it to her when I was little. After a lot of trouble until I finally got diagnosed, she regrets not listening. It would probably make that kid\u2019s life a lot easier if someone could help him with it early on, if he does turn out to have it.\n\nThat being said, be careful with how you approach his parents about it. They may deny that something is different about him, either because they don\u2019t want to think that something is up about their precious son, they don\u2019t him to be bullied for being different, cultural reasons, or for a whole myriad of other reasons.

YWNBTAH but prepare yourself to potentially lose this friend depending on the type of person they are.  If they are like myself and my wife, they will be glad you told them your thoughts so they can at least get checked out because the earlier things are detected, the more likely their child will succeed independently later in life if diagnosed on the spectrum.  If not, hey at least you know.\n\nBut the fact that you are seeing all these signs and their child is 4 and hasn't been diagnosed makes me think they are not like my wife and I.\n\nSadly, a lot of people out there just don't want to believe it and it isn't until someone in the school system brings it up that kids get tested.  That's their job though.  As a friend, it's not your job and being the messenger of some news that parents don't want to hear isn't always conducive to a long term relationship.", "YWNBTA, but I think you shouldn't say it so bluntly and leave the diagnosis to a doctor.\n\nWhy not just express your concern that her son seems to have a hard time understanding what's wrong with his behaviour and you feel for him when he gets told off so much, and if she seems open to that observation you could suggest it might be useful to see a professional who can help her communicate with him in a more effective way.", "I understand your suspicion but I would be careful not to mentally diagnose the child as autistic.

Early intervention is critical, you would not be an AH for trying to bring this up in a respectful way. Many children require speech therapy, OT, and/or PT; access to early intervention dramatically improves long term outcomes for both the individual and their families quality of life.\n\nAs far as the symptoms you observed, it does sound like he could be autistic and should be evaluated by a professional, using a standardized clinical eval like the ADOS. Even if he doesn't meet criteria for ASD, there are things that can be done about his behavioral problems.\n\n Saying \"Hey, I think your son has autism\" is probably not the right language. Instead, ask questions and try to avoid putting your friend in a situation where they feel defensive about their child or their parenting.", "I had a similar situation with my own son. I noticed much of the same behavior but to a lesser degree. One of his teachers, in frustration, told me he's clearly on the spectrum. Of course, that got me mad. I complained to the principal and we all had a meeting. The teacher had to apologize and say that she's not a medical professional, so she shouldn't have said anything. A year or so later, his Ped asked if we thought about testing him for Asperger's. Then it clicked. Did all the testing and yup.\n\nI guess I was finally ready to hear it. Even his daycare provider, who's a good family friend, noticed but didn't say anything. Her daughter is autistic and she saw the symptoms. \n\nAnyway, it's a tricky thing to bring up, so be mindful. She may not be ready to hear it yet. \n\nI did go back to my son's former teacher and apologize. She was so right.", "NTA, I do think he is displaying a lot of the traits from what you are describing.

I made a suggestion once to a parent friend and she was very much irritated by my suggestion.\n\nWhen their child begins school, educators in the school will be observing him from day one and will have the resources to suggest this to the parents if they think he is autistic and to recommend getting a real diagnosis.\n\nThe child may be demonstrating behaviors that are simply common to a preschooler without being on the spectrum. He's a little young to tell the difference by casual observation.", "NTA if you do it gently. \n\nI\u2019d word it in a way of \u201cI noticed child gets overstimulated quite often, have you considered getting him checked for autism?\u201d. Instead of trying to diagnose him or make it sound like you are, just raise the possibility of him getting checked.

You would be TA if you keep on it even after she shuts it down.", "I think we must think of the child and not the mother. I don\u2019t want to hide and coddle mother. The child\u2019s needs must be met. It must be assessed by a professional.\n\nBut how to deliver the message? I\u2019m not sure. It depends on the adult person tbh. But please do figure out something. \n \nPersonal: \n\nIm autistic and got diagnosed by 35 and has been through so many traumas that I\u2019m not able to work.  I was seen as lazy and whiny, spoiled and difficult child. \n\nI want for children to get the needs met.", "NTA but you have to say it with care. Sometimes parents don't want to think that something may be \"wrong\" with their child.", "NTA\n\nI have autism and ADHD. I was diagnosed very late and not receiving that diagnosis earlier has done a lot of damage.\n\nEveryone saying you shouldn't intrude and upset the parents have missed the point. Clearly your concern is for this child and their well being and that should be the only thing anyone should be focused on. This is about a child's happiness and development.\n\nOf course I'm not saying you should just be blunt and blurt it out, and I assume that wasn't what you were suggesting. I think having a private conversation with the mother, mentioning the behaviours you've noticed and what you think the possible cause is might alert her to some things that she might not have noticed or had previously ignored. Voicing a concern is not the same as giving a formal diagnosis, and I should hope everyone understands this. Talking to her might start with getting the child the help they need. Whatever the parents decide, trying to help a child who is clearly struggling is never the wrong thing to do.\n\nPlease share your concerns with her. Be as gentle as you can, but remember that autism is not an ugly word and should not be treated as such. And thank you for trying to look out for this kid.", "YTA because you aren't a doctor.

We had him in OT for some spatial awareness and proprioception issues but that was it. \n\nThen kindergarten started and we started getting calls from school and his after care program about behavior and we were absolutely baffled - we\u2019d never seen these issues at home. Never. We knew he was a little quirky, and had VERY occasional meltdowns, but never suspected autism. \n\nHe\u2019s in the evaluation process right now. I suspect it will come back with him being right on the line. \n\nI would not have taken well to a friend suggesting it. I had to come to the conclusion on my own.", "YWBTA.

I work with people with disabilities. It is difficult when you see signs and symptoms in other's children. Watching a parent/child struggle with interacting because parent's style triggers symptoms is heartbreaking. It is even harder knowing that the earlier the intervention the better the outcome. Waiting until they are school age is often too late for most early intervention programs.\n\nUnfortunately, many parents do not take any suggestion that there is something wrong with their child well. When I was younger, I was direct with a mom who was a close family friend & told her her child should be assessed for Autism. She cussed me out for suggesting anything was wrong with her severely disabled child. \n\nI have found it easier to interact with the child with respect to their sensitivities and allow the parent to ask me how I got the child to do \"x\".  I keep it very general, \"oh I work with kids and some do better and are more open with a less direct communication style.\" If they ask further, I suggest they ask their preschool, teacher, or pediatrician for some ideas or recommendations that might work better for their child.\n\nOn occasion, I have suggested they talk to a pediatrician when the parents complain about developmental delays or obvious autistic like behaviors.

The amount of times I have seen my father have adult tantrums in my lifetime is not a number I would wish on anyone.\n\nAnyway, yeah so this post isn\u2019t about me and my Dad but it felt good to vent.

I have no doubt it\u2019s a scary thought.", "Helping someone see a medical condition they may not know ow about or be aware of, as long as it is done tactfully, is never an asshole move. Definitely NTA.", "NTA. Find a polite way to approach the subject. \n\nMy son has autism. We did not handle it well, and it caused a TON of stress and anxiety and made everything worse for all of us, him especially. \n\nWhy? Because we did not know. We knew he had sensory issues with food, but when he showed more issues and we had him see therapists (different therapists and multiple years) they all started to screen for autism but said he couldn't have it because he is totally fine with eye contact and he cares about and understands others' feelings. \n\nThat's very old thinking, and someone can have autism and make eye contact, or be social, or have empathy, etc. Eventually we decided we don't care what they say, we started treating him as if he had autism, and it made our family so much better. I wish we had done so sooner, but he is our oldest so everything was new to us, and we had a lot of other issues we were dealing with. It helped us understand that when he talked back, he wasn't being mean or rude, his brain just takes language extremely literally. When he was freaking out and hitting at us and yelling because we had him stop something or he was in trouble, it wasn't because he was just mean, it was because he didn't handle transitions well and when he got overwhelmed like that he needed left alone for a few minutes. When he said he didn't do something, mainly things he did during meltdowns, it wasn't because he was lying to us - he really doesn't remember what happens during his meltdowns. \n\nJust knowing the reason has made everything better. Honestly the amount of trouble he's in has dropped off from constant to almost never, as we've found ways to help like smooth transition times, calming and preventing meltdowns, and being more literal with our words (and teaching him common sayings for when other people are less literal). If someone had told us earlier, it would have saved years of tears and fights and pain and sadness. \n\nAnd yes he has been diagnosed finally, as ASD became more understood.", "As a parent to a child who has been diagnosed with being on the spectrum,  we haven't told anyone but our parents because we think it's no ones business really and our child can decide later on in life if she wants to share her diagnosis. \n\nHowever, we have friends who have made very light suggestions to us...

I will echo the comments that are saying \"bring it up, but be careful with wording\" as some people get weirdly offended/aggressive if you suggest their child may be Autistic (or any kind of ND, even though there is absolutely nothijg wrong with them, just a difference in neurotype). Also, be prepared for your friend to possibly not want you as a friend anymore after you bring it up with them. I've known many people to take it extremely personally when these things happen due to the bs stigma and stereotypes of Autistic people.\n\nMy stepchild is Autistic, and her grandmother would get extremely angry and defensive when it was brought up that her father was getting her evaluated. The GM was actually extremely against the process because \"there's nothing wrong with her, she's completely normal.\" She IS completely normal:  a completely normal Autistic child. But, the GM refused to acknowledge her overstimulation and extreme meltdowns due to it as Autism. Instead, she called her naughty or a drama queen. Autism was, and still is, a dirty word to this woman. The only time I've ever heard her say that my SD is Autistic is when she introduced her to an uncle and whispered dramatically that \"she's.... a little Autistic\" and had to correct her that there is no such thing, Autism is Autism, and it isn't a secret that needs whispering. \n\nAll that to say, not acknowledging the fact that a child is ND, will only hurt them in the long run. My own ND wasn't acknowledged till I was 27, and I suffered a lot over the years because of it. I hope they are receptive so that they can be a great source of support for their child.", "NTA, \n\nBut you will most likely meet extremely heavy resistance from the parents, whenever I've diagnosed someone's child in the past parents are the number one opposition to it, it has to be approached calmly, also if you believe one parent would be less likely to become irate than the other you might approach them first, of course having printouts or some other item to show typical autistic behavior and how it relates to the child's behavior is also useful, often seeing a guide with identification that matches up closely to their child's behavior is a key part to them taking a critical look, good luck", "NTA. I wish someone would have said something about my son earlier. People dropped hints but didn\u2019t say anything very upfront. However, he wasn\u2019t violent. But you need to be prepared.

Earlier help is better", "You won't be an AH, but I think it's a really bad idea. \n\nIf they never thought their kid was autistic, it's probably because they aren't ready to face the truth. And if you tell them, the reactions can be violent. They might never want to see you again, or accuse you to want to feel superior with your child... I trust they are good friends, but you never know how people react when shocked and hurt. \n\nThe thing is... it's their first, so they might not know his behavior isn't typical. And you are right, you don't raise a NT child the way you raise a ND. (And idc if your cousin/child-from-best-friend/etc is autistic. Trust autistic people on this. Do not raise us like you would NT. You're harming us and mostly make us have very-low self-esteem and developp anxiety. Of course ND children need to be raised and educated, you just use different tools. Special clocks, stimtoys, anger-pillows, sensory rooms...

Autism is genetic, it\u2019s highly unlikely they don\u2019t have family members who are either diagnosed or show similar symptoms. They might have as children and learned to mask and internalized it as bring bad and shameful. \n\nOr they could have asked their pediatrician already, and been told that it wasn\u2019t a possibility. Doctors aren\u2019t without bias. \n\nI myself was diagnosed because of my English Teacher in 5th grade advocating for me. My previous Doctor didn\u2019t believe in, well anything really besides infections. \n\nMy daughter showed symptoms at age 3, her pediatrician said there was no way. When I got my daughter in therapy after my mother died they were diagnosed with ADHD.  After a provider shift through the clinic we were through shutting down I asked the new Psychiatrist about the food issues, the sensory issues, the repetitive motions and outbursts. She diagnosed my daughter as Oppositional Defiant Disorder without any tests because \u201cgirls don\u2019t get autism\u201d. The irony being this person worked in the same building as the Autism Clinic at Cleveland Clinic and the head of the department is a world recognized expert. I made an appointment with said expert, 3 days of testing later and a 30 page diagnosis report of Socio-sensory processing disorder, I was validated that my concerns were justified. (Dr. Spear said it\u2019s ASD lite under the DSM-5 but it\u2019s still a form of autism just without developmental delays in fine motor skills). \n\n\nMy son was non-verbal, met some developmental milestones really really early (turned over onto his stomach at 3 days old, lifted his head at one week) but severe delays in fine motor. Pediatrician said it couldn\u2019t be autism because he made verbal noises and had gross motor skills. Dr. Spear tested for 5 days. My son is mid-support needs ASD with savant syndrome (IQ of 179, first unprompted word was thermodynamics but emotionally will never be older than 4)\n\nYour friends could have a really crappy doctor who is biased against autism and thinks autism is only little boys who can\u2019t talk and don\u2019t meet gross motor milestones.\n\nThey could be autistic themselves but with their own parents being of the belief autism isn\u2019t real and just an excuse for bad behavior.\n\nEspecially if anyone is connected to Nazi era Germany when Autism was a death sentence and Asperger\u2019s was a \u201cautistic but useful\u201d diagnosis. That was my original diagnosis, asperger\u2019s syndrome. It\u2019s been changed in my medical records obviously to ASD but imagine how hard it was for my grandparents to hear that. My Jewish-Romani Grandparents. If they weren\u2019t  the most loving, giving, fantastic people they were the diagnosis absolutely would have been easier to ignore (like my Mother did). \n\nSo broach the subject about autism and see where they are. If they are against the idea or don\u2019t believe it exists, do nothing. Be safe and help the kid as best you can by staying involved.\n\nIf they are open to it, and say  something oh yeah I asked the doctor about it for son and they dismissed the possibility and said it\u2019s just behavioral when discussing autism in general, suggest they seek a second opinion because you\u2019ve heard horror stories of doctors stereotyping and denying testing based on their bias. (Plenty of doctors absolutely think only white males get autism and all autism looks the same). \n\nBut you are absolutely not the A. H.  to address this topic. And you are absolutely not the A.  H. to be concerned. \n\nHere\u2019s another example: My husband was adopted at age 6. His adoptive mom refuses to consider he is on the spectrum, because she isn\u2019t.   Plenty of people have suggested he be tested in his childhood, unbeknownst to him. When we got married and he started recognizing patterns he has that my son has he questioned his mother and she said he was never tested and she\u2019s sick of people bringing it up. She\u2019s not autistic so he can\u2019t possibly be. \n\nHe\u2019s got a biological uncle who is. He tested higher on the RAADS screening than I do, or my kids (his step) and we all have diagnoses.  He\u2019s currently waiting on a list for evaluation.

I was grateful someone saw the things that concerned me and we did get him tested and into appropriate therapies. All this to say, please step lightly and don\u2019t push. But be a good friend and come from the perspective of love and care for the child and your friend. \n\nI want to add that encouraging them to talk to their pediatrician is an ok thing but most are not trained to see children with level 1 or even level 2 autism diagnosis (used to be referred to as Asperger\u2019s or high functioning) they only tend to pick up the more severe ones. My son\u2019s doctor was never concerned because he passed their \u201ctest\u201d in office.

Now I think both her kids are autistic, another was born, and they are very similar in neurodivergent symptoms.

It\u2019s not the same as autism, but I went undiagnosed with ADHD as a child (back in the 80s it was considered something only boys got). I often reflect on how much easier my struggles would have been if there had been a label so I could get the help I needed to get through school, work, and life. It\u2019s a much harder experience when you get a diagnosis in your 40s \u2014 if a diagnosis can even be gotten. \n\nAnother factor is how hard it can be, depending on where you live, to get diagnosed with autism as an adult. The waitlist where I am for assessment that\u2019s covered by the government is YEARS long and requires at least one parent or older sibling to participate and relay to the doctors how you behaved a child. If your parents are deceased or just flat out refuse because they\u2019re in denial, it is next to impossible to get diagnosed. Private clinic assessment costs thousands of dollars. \n\nA formal diagnosis doesn\u2019t just help a child grow up with the right support, it also opens doors to more supports in post-secondary (sometimes including financial aid) and employment settings. There are many reasonable accommodations that can be made at school and work, but they\u2019re usually only available when there is a formal diagnosis.", "One good way to present it is to present the symtoms from the kid\u2019s perspective like \u00ab\u00a0he seems to prefer to spend time alone\u00a0\u00bb, \u00ab\u00a0he plays this way, which is common for autistic people\u00a0\u00bb, \u00ab\u00a0in loud environments/busy places, he seems to get overstimulated quickly and appears uncomfortable\u00a0\u00bb.

I nannied for an autistic kid and when his preschool made him get evaluated, his mom basically did the least and at the pediatrician said something along the lines of \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with him, he\u2019s just like my brother!\u201d What shocked me is that she somehow didn\u2019t know her brother is autistic. He\u2019s literally a savant. Many neurodivergencies, including autism, run in families so admitting your kid is autistic means looking more closely at your whole family too.", ">Don't diagnose, rather ask if this is something they have looked into/has their GP ever mentioned anything like it?\n\nThis exactly", "Agree with this wholeheartedly--but especially the \"don't diagnose\" part.\n\nI got a diagnosis of ADHD as an adult, and I have three stepchildren, all with varying degrees of disability. The oldest is severely affected by a developmental disability that requires him to have a one-to-one aide, even in his early 30s. The youngest has ADHD and is severely affected and needed a \\*lot\\* of support to make it through middle and high school, in spite of higher than typical intelligence.\n\nThe middle one has ADHD and what he and we thought for a long time was autism,  but  after intensive evaluation, turned out with a psychological diagnosis rather than autism. The symptoms are very close and many of the same supports and \"copes\" are helpful to him, but not all of them, and from a medication perspective it is very, very different than it would have been with autism.\n\nIt's wonderful and useful that you know enough to be able to identify some classic symptoms of a potential developmental issue, and that you care about the child and parents enough to potentially risk your friendship in order to do what you think is right for the welfare of the family.\n\nThat said, regardless of symptoms that might apply to a particular diagnoses, it sounds like the child needs an evaluation; they might actually point to something else. And it can take a good bit of investigation to differentiate between  different potential diagnoses. If the parents don't notice or take in the \"classic\" autistic symptoms you mention, they might not know anything at all about developmental/neurological issues, and it could be really scary for them; imho it's not a great idea to send them off into a Dr. Google tunnel. Sometimes one parent will be on board but the other is resistant. That is really difficult for the family.\n\nI agree that anonymous letter might be the best way, though perhaps a conversation would be better; if you decide to do the latter, I would strongly recommend speaking to the parent you are closer to--which sounds like it could be the mom--and \\*be sure to ask her consent for what might be a difficult conversation about her child.\\* If she doesn't consent, she won't be prepared, and she might become even more resistant that she might have otherwise been). If it feels right, you might also offer to be with her for the evaluation, or for the news, or to advocate with the school if and when supports are discussed.\n\nEither way you might choose to go about it, it can be framed as \"some behaviors that could cause them issues as their child goes through school.\" A great, non-impactful way to start is for them to go to the teacher who no doubt has noticed some of these behaviors and is probably itching to weigh in.\n\nIn short, in whatever words feel right to you, it is essential that they know they will not be in this alone; that support is absolutely available and, indeed, legally mandated by the federal government that the school and district give a child a FAPE (Free and Appropriate Public Education); and that, even if the child \\*is\\* neurotypical and is simply not hitting the benchmarks in the typical timeframe, the family could potentially get support behaviorally for the biting, for example.\n\nAnd as u/FaceTheJury mentions below, as with any medical evaluation, it's only information. The family can decide whatever they want with the information offered. This could be really important for them to hear, especially if they may or may not have any understanding at all about neurodiversity and the implications of having a child with a diagnosis. They may view it as a relief and \"yay now we can get support and services for my child!\" But they may go into denial, or fear, or any of a number of other resistant emotions as a strategy to deal with the overwhelm that absolutely comes with any kind of developmental diagnosis of a child, especially if the child is severely affected and especially since they seem to come down hard on him when they don't like his behaviors. If they are rigid, it will take a lot of support for \\*them\\* to come to terms with what might be a scary and unfamiliar world of raising a child who doesn't fit into the \"normal\" way of functioning and whose needs could be intensive for the rest of his life.", "The best part about a label is that there are generally methods of dealing with someone with said label. There are tons of ways to help autistic children with negative behaviors.

As something to be checked out, not to be overlooked. The result isn't something OP needs to know. But please, please do not avoid mentioning the label/diagnosis out of a fear of stereotypes.

That must be super difficult.   \n\n\nBut what would be the motivation of a teacher \\*not\\* to bring this up? In fact, it is much more difficult on them to support a child without a diagnosis than with.  Most teachers absolutely try, with the parents and often with their supervisors, to point out important behavioral issues. But in spite of having the education and their own direct, all day experience and observations of the child, hey have ZERO authority to push beyond that. The amount of resistance that comes from the districts is absolutely crushing. Sadly, that comes down to budget, in spite of the legal mandates to give children a free and appropriate public education.", "You do realize that parents are the ones with the authority to seek a diagnosis and a teacher cannot do anything without their cooperation? They don't really have the power to \"step in\", just advise. They aren't being discreet because they are afraid to hurt parents' sensitive feelings, they are acting carefully because that's the best way to convince the parents to seek medical help.

Hearing it from someone with credibility and experience in working with children may make it seem less like a judgment. And all you have to say is, \u201chey I\u2019ve noticed these behaviors and he seems really distressed by certain things. I\u2019ve seen these in other kids, and they ended up having autism? Have you thought about getting him evaluated?\u201d\n\nFailing to talk to parents about the possibility of autism or other issues prevents them from getting the services they need. I\u2019ve cared for several kids whose parents adamantly denied diagnoses of ADHD and autism, despite it being readily apparent. Those kids suffer so much, getting kicked out of schools and alienated by their peers, when they have a problem that IS totally treatable and manageable with the appropriate interventions. \n\nAlso: some parents really just don\u2019t know. They may blame themselves and their perceived failures in parenting. There is also the fear that the clinician may just associate the behaviors with their parenting abilities and shame them. Thus, even though it\u2019s a difficult topic to broach, a diagnosis can also be incredibly validating for both kids and parents struggling with severe behavioral issues.", "Ok but I'm a speech language pathologist who works in the school setting and there is a huge difference between reporting and taking action on an identified need and telling a parent \"your kid had autism.\" Teachers are great at knowing when something is awry but they do not have the training to know exactly what that is. I don't diagnose autism either but I can't tell you how many times a teacher has told a parent the student has problem X when it's actually problem Y and then I have to undo all of the damage that has been done. Parents will all react differently but if they think we as a school are \"changing our minds\" it makes us look incompetent and they get mad. They also, if they are caring proactive parents, might do their research and come into the IEP meetings asking foe specific things based on what the teacher told them that would not only NOT help their child, but may actually hurt their progress if it is inappropriate. A psych could chime in with more info on autism specifically, but there is a lot of overlap in the ways ASD, ADHD, anxiety, etc can present and specific tests are needed to differentiate. So a concerned teacher would be more helpful to say something vague like the teacher above described and then start communication between the SPED team and the parents. A diagnosis is only helpful in that it can get support and services so labeling the kid doesn't help nearly as much as starting an SST/assessment does.", "\"More professional\"?? You're obviously not a teacher. I teach high school and we don't throw out diagnoses like that as individuals. We're not qualified to diagnose, and the inevitable backlash can harm the kid more than us.\n\nThe way to approach it is for teachers to pool information with each other, counselors, admin, nurse, and the school psychologist if there is one. It's a process that takes time and documentation. The teacher is not the professional who handles such matters. Psychologists and counselors are.", "I disagree with this. Teachers aren't taught how to identify/ label these things and it can be damaging to kids if they are misidentified by some teacher who knows better \ud83d\ude44\n\nMentioning going to a doctor is reasonable, providing an unqualified opinion is not and would likely damage the relationship regardless of the outcome.", "Teachers actually aren't ALLOWED to say they think a student has a particular disability. If I had this kid in my class, this is what I would tell the parent, but trust me that they're would be a flurry of activity behind the scenes as well.

She explained that the only reason she was saying anything was that because early intervention can mean a world of difference for the child, and seeing a specialist would do no harm, and at the very least could give peace of mind if she was wrong. The sister in law lost it. She flipped out cut off contact with my sister and her husband. Her child is now an most 4 and still nonverbal, and she is still in denial that there\u2019s anything abnormal.

I've just recently, in my 30s, realized that I almost certainly have ADHD.\n\nWhen I was around 12, one of my teachers wanted me to get tested, but I refused because it was communicated to me as \"we want to see if there's something wrong with you\". I was deeply offended by that and absolutely hated that teacher for the rest of my time in school.\n\nIf they'd said something like \"some people think differently than others, and it's important to know because you might be happier being taught in a different way than most\", I would have been happy to get tested. Instead they put a clear judgment value on \"abnormal\" being inferior.", "That\u2019s my point.

And teachers know a great deal about what the kid does. Some might still not look into it! Getting an autism diagnosis isn\u2019t easy, many professionals still want to cure it with discipline.

This can be from physical pain or some mental stress but it\u2019s relevant to point out that doing nothing is not an option.", "There is a difference between saying they think it is a certain disability and putting in a referral for evaluation.  And it absolutely is the teachers place to out the kids best interests first. Just saying talk to your pediatrician about these behavioral problems absolutely can make a kid\u2019s life worse.  There are subtle ways you should be checking what the situation is because of risk of abuse. \n\nLike a 5 year old who isn\u2019t potty trained. \nOr a 10 year old not making eye contact and not speaking. \n\nBoth could be medical problems, or related to autism, or be signs of abuse. \n\nIt\u2019s extremely sad that people who are mandated reporters think telling a parent to talk to their pediatrician is the only acceptable response. \n\nAnd as an autistic person who was abused by my mother and have two autistic kids I would absolutely not be offended at being questioned. I absolutely advocate for good teachers who communicate their concerns, even if it is reporting to an admin who follows up with me asking for proof I am addressing things like proper medication, what support services my kids are getting, etc. I do know people who had CPS involvement because a teacher made the call and they hadn\u2019t had the support to get help. And I know kids who were taken away and placed in foster care because their parents were failing to provide medical care, because my kids did group therapy with them, had occupational therapy with them, speech therapy\u2026and I would get to know the foster parents in the waiting room. \n\nDiagnosing and advocating for the child are not the same thing. \n\nNoticing a child is being treated poorly (she said they yell at the kid for what looks like stimming and meltdowns) is not diagnosing. \n\nAnd just suggesting they speak to a pediatrician is absolutely not enough when what exactly are they speaking to the pediatrician about?

I divorced my ex over, among other things, his refusal to accept that our younger son was showing signs of developmental delays and needed Sp Ed services. Son's assessment was PDD NOS, now recognized as Level 1 ASD.\n\nI then had the distinct displeasure of having to co-parent with him for the next 10 years while he vehemently maintained there was \"nothing wrong with his son\" and denied him the supports he needed to be more successful in social and interpersonal relationships, and when confronted with frustration/struggle.", "Yes.

If OP was a stranger, I would agree with you, but she\u2019s not. \n\nIts like if someone had a close friend who appears to be depressed and their close friend suggests they could be struggling from depression and should seek help from a professional. There\u2019s nothing wrong with it, in fact it\u2019s really helpful.

OP seems to have enough of an understanding to identify that this may not just be a kid who doesn\u2019t behave due to poor/uneducated  parenting, but rather something else causing it, like ASD. Sure, op shouldn\u2019t diagnose, but mentioning ASD isn\u2019t wrong. \n\nIf it isn\u2019t ASD, the family/child still needs help, this behavior is something that professionals like myself treat every day regardless of the diagnosis, and OP\u2019s suggestion of seeking professional help could be massively beneficial. It could also help the parents as they may feel like failures right now, believing the behavioral issues are their fault and not knowing how to fix it.", "Considering they gave a pretty detailed reason they suspect it which lines up with my knowledge of autism, I\u2019m assuming.
