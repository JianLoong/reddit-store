What a horrid thing to do. She does not get to judge your daughter\u2019s attachment to any object.  Please protect your daughter and get her out of this space quickly", "NTA.\n\nI'm sixty one. I have a little lamb my favorite aunt gave me when I was five. She is gone, it's still here. It is such an important reminder of someone who truly loved me. It's the only thing I have left from my childhood. It has soaked up my tears so many times, both as a child and adult. Almost like it was her shoulder.\n\nYour mother needs to learn the difference between removing a luxury and taking away a treasure of the heart.\n\nHug your kid for us, k? <3", "Your mother is using archaic punishments for apathy. It doesn't fit the crime. A good talking to and maybe no phone privileges for *that* evening would have sufficed. Your mother is setting her up for failure. Failure to be sympathetic and also communicating that it's not nice to have to be asked twice. \n\nAlso, I'm 32 now and I sleep with a giant shark stuffed animal and it's my safe object. You're never too old to have stuffed animals and tell your mother the one who sleeps with a stuffed animal shark works for the government (I do). \n\nNTA.", "NTA. So not only did your daughter lose her mother, but also her home, both within two months? Your daughter is not \u201cextra emotional\u201d, she\u2019s fucking grieving! Her whole life collapsed and your mother treats it as if it was nothing. That bunny is not just a bunny but for your daughter it represents her last link to her mother. I might say your daughter could use a therapist and your mother a cardiologist to check if she actually has a heart.", "NTA HURRY UP AND MOVE!! That was cruel. And talk to your daughter about respecting your mom while still there. She should of taken out trash. Respect her home and her requests. You do need to get your own place. Stay close with your daughter 15 is tough with both parents.", "NTA. What your mom did was awful. You need to protect our daughter by getting her out of that space and into a place where she feels safe. I'm sorry for your loss. I'm also sorry to inform you that you don't have the time to find a new place that you thought you did. Your daughter needs to feel safe in a space of her own so she can cope better now more than ever.", "NTA the stuffed animal is sentimental to your daughter and whether she is 5, 15 or 25 she shouldn't have done that.", "Not at all. I\u2019m 26 and I have 2 blankets that I\u2019ve had since I was in the single digits. I need them to sleep as well and couldn\u2019t imagine how I\u2019d feel if someone took them away from me.", "NTA.  Your daughter needed that and you made sure to take care of her emotional needs.\n\nHowever, if you are going to continue to live with your mother and she is going to continue to play a part in helping to raise your child, you need to set very specific and clear rules with her about what is and isn\u2019t okay.  And she needs to understand what your daughter is going through.\n\nI know you said your daughter and you are both in therapy.  It may be worth bringing mom to one of the therapy sessions and doing a little family session and discussing how to get on the same page to make sure you are doing the best you can to support your daughter during this time.", "Your daughter is 15 and her mom shouldn't have died and your mother is an asshole for robbing her of that little comfort. NTA", "NTA. go take away your mothers room in her own house and see how she likes it. Oh it\u2019s much different? It\u2019s a much bigger scale? No. She\u2019s be emotionally distraught if she couldn\u2019t sleep because she didn\u2019t feel safe and comfortable on the street. Your daughter obviously feels safe and comfort from her stuffed animal that was from her mother. Your mom has no right to use that as a mean of punishment. I hope she learns your daughters mental health isn\u2019t something to poke at. Just keep her phone or put her in her room. Make her sweep the floor or something.", "NTA.  Move.  She is YOUR mother, and your child is not her child.  She overstepped, and she knowingly triggered a panic attack.  As someone who has panic attacks, this is hard to get past.\n\nYour daughter is grieving a profound and terrible loss, as are you.  How you both get through is between the two of you and your therapist(s).  What your mother did would have been wrong if she actually were the parent-- it was cruel and manipulative-- but it is doubly out of line as she is not the parent here.\n\nI am sorry for your loss.", "NTA\n\nWhat your mother did wasn\u2019t just wrong. It was actively cruel. And to her grieving granddaughter.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss. You are not setting your daughter up for failure by allowing her to cuddle a toy that brings her comfort ever, let alone when she\u2019s grieving her recently deceased mother.", "NTA, but you will be if you allow your mother to discipline your daughter again. \n\nI don't understand how your mother could *cause* your daughter to have a panic attack, stand back and watch it, and then *defend* her decision. \n\nTaking a comfort item is not an appropriate punishment. It is especially cruel when it's an item she associates with a parent who just passed away two months ago. \n\nHonestly, watching someone I love have a panic attack would be unbearable to me, but your mother can tolerate *causing* one in her granddaughter? Wow.", "Oh yay, I love when people need validation on such obvious problems. Obviously NTA, your mom shouldn't have taken away such a sentimental object from your daughter for such a petty reason. Keep doing what you're doing and focusing on your daughter's mental health. Maybe have a talk with your mom about boundaries and what not. Best of luck!", "NTA.", "NAH. It was an honest mistake on your mother's part.\n\nYour mother doesn't have to *like* or understand your decision. She just has to abide by it.", "Your daughter can take GrandMa's trash out while she's crying. And she can have her bunny back after she does.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
