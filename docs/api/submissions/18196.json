Your mom was wrong but I'd actually ask her to go with you and not your daughter and talk to the therapist and learn some acceptable boundaries and ways to communicate and things that are ok now even if they seem a little childish to her.

NTA but your mom sure is. A big, fat one. I'm furious on your behalf. Your daughter is grieving and clinging to something that makes her feel cherished by her mother. Your mom didn't just try to punish her for not listening. She also tried to punish her for clinging to a toy when granny says she's too old. The reason your daughter is doing so doesn't matter to your mom. You may seriously need to find somewhere else to go. Grieving teenagers tend to be defiant.

I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. I wish my dad dealt with a grieving teenager like you are doing. Best of luck.", "Your mom wanted to take away the phone, but saw that wasn\u2019t gut wrenching enough, so she set her mind on the stuffed animal that your dead wife gave her. That\u2019s fucked up. Get out of there.", "Same! I\u2019m 30 and would just be inconsolable", "Meanwhile, does your daughter have a way to lock up her things to keep them safe?  If your mom doesn\u2019t understand why what she did was so wrong, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d trust her not to take out the trash herself, with the bunny in it!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(I say this as a former child whose dad threw away many things that were precious to me, either to punish me for caring about them or just because they weren\u2019t important to him.)", "Maybe she should have a chat with your mum and tell her what you are both going through. She might be trying to put some normalcy in your daughter's life as working with a grieving child would be very difficult for everyone involved. It's hard enough with adults. Goodluck to you all.", "I said the mother was wrong about taking the toy and thinking the daughter was too old for it. However, in OP's post, he doesn't say he had a talk to her about doing her chores when he  gave the toy back. Neither the daughter or the mother is innocent, which is why it was right to give  back the toy, but OP still needs to have a firm talk with both of them about their behaviour, not just blame the mother."]}
