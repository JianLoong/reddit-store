Your mother needs to realise that her MINOR granddaughter is grieving and is using an object of comfort that has a direct link to her mother that she only VERY recently lost.

Your mom was wrong but I'd actually ask her to go with you and not your daughter and talk to the therapist and learn some acceptable boundaries and ways to communicate and things that are ok now even if they seem a little childish to her.

Definitely. But an equivalent punishment. Not ruining her sleep for who knows how long. \n\nShe just lost her mother.

NTA but your mom sure is. A big, fat one. I'm furious on your behalf. Your daughter is grieving and clinging to something that makes her feel cherished by her mother. Your mom didn't just try to punish her for not listening. She also tried to punish her for clinging to a toy when granny says she's too old. The reason your daughter is doing so doesn't matter to your mom. You may seriously need to find somewhere else to go. Grieving teenagers tend to be defiant.

A 5 year old can see that the daughter must be attached to the bunny, and since granny was threatening to take the phone as a form of punishment, its obvious that her choice to take the bunny as an alternative was **also** intended as a punishment.", "\u201cDevil\u2019s advocate\u201d was originally a term for someone whose job was to help improve the original point being made, by nitpicking it to ensure the argument held together. If you don\u2019t actually agree with someone, you are not playing devil\u2019s advocate - you\u2019re just arguing. The usual usage, as with you here, is \u201cI don\u2019t agree, and I know my disagreement is going to be obviously bizarre and unpopular, so I\u2019m going to use this thin shield of a phrase in an effort to distance myself from the argument I\u2019m making\u201d.\n\nIt is absolutely hilarious that you read \u201ctook away a toy given to a grieving child by their dead mother, specifically because they knew it would hurt her more than anything else they could take, with causing misery as punishment being the sole purpose of the action\u201d and think we don\u2019t know enough to say whether the person was being an AH. Get a grip.", ">Some people are just genuinely emotionally blind. \n\n\nYou. It's you. You're the problem, it's you", "I think even that the word choice of \"wallowing\" was poor. When my dad died, I didn't have a lot of time to get back on top of things (bills, etc), sometimes it just isn't an option.\n\nIt has been 20 years since my dad died, and I am still emotionally effed up in many ways. But it was also really important that I got back on the horse and tried to fake it til I made it. \n\nWe can't let loss destroy our future.", "> Oh no, in your 40's you poor thing.\n\nGrief is not a competition. You may think that your sarcasm wins you points but you\u2019re so intent on one-upmanship that you missed my point by a country mile. \n\nMe being in my mid-40s made me *better* equipped to deal with grief than a 15-year-old, yet I was still randomly crying 6 months later. I\u2019m giving far, far more more grace to a teenager than I gave myself.", "I am not arguing that the bunny was important, I am allowing for the possibility that her grandmother didn't realise that it was linked to the child's mother, and that it was more than the usual attachment a child has with their comfort toys. \n\nThis entire thread is a mass of overreactions from people who probably have never had to go through the experience of losing a parent when they are young. I would actively welcome the perspective of someone who has also had one or both of their parents die very suddenly.", "\u201ctook away a toy given to a grieving child by their dead mother, specifically because they knew it would hurt her more than anything else they could take\"\n\nIt is so amazing, your super power of knowing what that person was thinking even though you don't know them. \n\nNONE OF US KNOWS FOR SURE the motivation of the grandmother. She might be an AH, or, she might just be a fckn idiot. \n\nThe fact that now a number of us are arguing about some old lady that we will never meet, and insisting that we know her intentions - that is truly ridiculous.\n\nI hope that OP and their family are able to find a way forward after this, and I hope that their daughter and her grandmother ultimately re-establish their relationship, as she will need their support as she adjusts to existing in a world without her mother.", "> It has been 20 years since my dad died, and I am still emotionally effed up in many ways.\n\nWith respect and compassion, I think you should consider therapy to help you finally grieve bathe loss of your dad. \n\nYou have certainly developed a huge lack of empathy, I suspect because you didn\u2019t show yourself much compassion and allow yourself to grieve. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that your circumstances forced you to do so. \n\n> We can't let loss destroy our future.\n\nAnd yet, by not dealing with your loss, you may be doing exactly that. If you show such little compassion and empathy I wonder about your relationships with yourself and people in general.", "Honestly I could not give less of a shit about points. \n\nI am 40 now, but my dad died when I was 20, and I was a very immature 20.\n\nIn my real life I work in customer service, and I try really hard to offer people the opposite perspective, because in many cases it helps them to understand where their \"opposition\" is coming from. \n\nLosing a parent is truly fucked. But OPs parents have also lost the in-laws - which sometimes doesn't matter, but my mum and dad's parents were close, so it was shit for them as well when someone passed.", "No, you clearly wouldn\u2019t welcome that perspective, because here you are arguing with me. Countdown to you claiming I\u2019m \u201coverreacting\u201d *because* I empathise with the kid in 3, 2\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve also worked with providing support for grieving children and families, so take that angle of attack off your list while you\u2019re at it.\n\nGranny knew that the kid had more than the usual attachment to the comfort toy, *because she specifically responded to the father remonstrating with her by saying the kid was too attached to the toy anyway*. That knowledge is something she was using to deliberately cause hurt, not something she lacked.", "Kid says they don\u2019t care about having x taken.\n\nGrandmother takes y instead because she knows that *will* hurt the child.\n\nCHILD HAS A PANIC ATTACK.\n\nDad tells grandmother this was not acceptable.\n\nGrandmother DOUBLES DOWN AND SAYS SHE WAS CORRECT BECAUSE THE CHILD\u2019S ATTACHMENT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.\n\nAt which point of this do you think someone who wasn\u2019t an AH might get a clue?\n\nThe answer, from a \u201cdecent parenting\u201d perspective, is \u201ctaking items away purely to cause unhappiness is ineffective parenting and an AH move\u201d. You take a phone or electronics away *if the kid is focusing on those instead of something they should be doing* it *if the misbehaviour involved them*, if you do it just because the kid doesn\u2019t like it then you\u2019re being an AH. It\u2019s that simple.", "I get where you're coming from, it has just been frustrating to have people who haven't had the same experience try to tell me I'm wrong. \n\nIt has been a long time since I was in OP's daughter's boots, but it felt like an overreaction to immediately deem the grandmother as the AH. \n\nOPs sweet child should have all the possible support for them to make it through to adulthood without it negatively impacting their life or mental health.\n\nTruly the only thing I really wanted to talk about was the possibility that the grandmother didn't realise the impact of her actions."]}
