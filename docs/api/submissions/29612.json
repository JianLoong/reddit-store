Well a while back I was taking care of a child with heart issues, she always loved roses so I\u2019ll call her Rose to protect her and her family\u2019s privacy.She unfortunately passed away, I remember that day vividly, she was playing one minute then she started to cry, I went to pick her up and she was unconscious not to long after. Poor baby died in my arms, I cried with her parents and went to her funeral and dropped a lovely bouquet of flowers on her casket. I went to therapy and I still go to therapy. I can now hear about heart problems and other stuff related to hearts but I haven\u2019t brought myself to be responsible for the care of a child with heart issues. This also goes for other issues, I\u2019ve had ti refuse a kid with lung issues and a kid who had epilepsy because the feeling of having a kid die in your arms is to much to handle once let alone a second or third. Well a new kid joined the nursery well call her Gina 4F, Gina is a sweet girl but she\u2019s had a series of heart attacks in the past and was put on a medication for it, she\u2019s a sweet girl and I interact with her occasionally but having her in my care full time is to much for me to handle. Well her mom asked why Gina was never put in my group and my boss told her the situation with the Rose and her mom got mad and said that I was being childish and I should get over it and her kid needed help now. My boss put a stop to that immediately and told her she was insensitive and if she made another comment like that again they were gonna remove her and her kid and they\u2019d have to find somewhere else. I\u2019ve been thinking about it and I was wondering if I really was being childish? So AITA?\n\nI forgot to add that Gina is still taken care of, she\u2019s been put in a group with my other colleagues and shes thriving and doing very well.\n\nEdit: It\u2019s just being with kids who have issues with their heart/lungs/liver etc alone that triggers me. Rose passed away during nap time on my shift so I was alone while everyone else was on break or taking lunch, it\u2019s not so much being around them more so being ALONE with them.", "created_utc": 1698201555, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17funnq/aita_for_refusing_to_look_after_a_child_with/", "score": 228, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's throwing a tantrum but given your context, I'd also be very reluctant to take care of another child with heart problems. Don't you even start second-guessing yourself. You don't want to remember your time in nursery as a doomed time where small kids died on your arms on more than one occasion.\n\nI get she wants her kid to be treated equally, but if it happens like this now, just imagine if Gina *does die* on your arms. Will she react like this too?\n\nYou don't need it. Also, all the best to you. You do angel's work.", "NTA. Not at all. You have every right to boundaries to safeguard your mental health. That\u2019s really the end of the story. I have some sympathy for Gina\u2019s mother, because it must be quite difficult to see your young child undergo a series of cardiac arrests, but still, she has no right to tell childcare professionals where their boundaries can and cannot be. My hat\u2019s off to you. Childcare is a very underappreciated profession, and I think most people are unaware of the toll it takes on people.", "NTA Your boss supports you, so I think you should take that as evidence that you are doing the right thing for you. That\u2019s all you can do and that\u2019s all you should do.", "NTA. \n\nYou went through something incredibly traumatic. Where you work it seems as if there are plenty of caregivers available and no child is lacking in care. Thank your boss for being awesome!", "NTA. Will you someday be able to work with a child with a heart condition? Maybe. But not right now - you know your current limits. And they are completely understandable. And it\u2019s okay. I am so sorry for what you went through - I cannot imagine how it affects you daily. I hope you find healing.", "NTA. You are actually being very responsible right now while working through your trauma. Think about it this way: kids with my condition (T1 Diabetes) look like we're having heart issues during low blood sugar episodes. We go pale, incoherent, start sweating and shaking, and often refuse to accept help when it's offered the first time because our brains aren't getting enough oxygen. The situation can turn deadly in less than 15 minutes. If you\u2014 still traumatized and in therapy\u2014 were in charge of such a child today, could you honestly take clear-headed action in a timely manner while struggling with your own issues? IMHO, Gina's mom hasn't thought this through.", "NTA. You aren't a specialist and she isn't going to receive anything special from you she wouldn't get from another caretaker. (Zero disrespect to you of course) Mother is making up her own issues, and boss is taking care of it. It doesn't sound like Gina is bothered one iota, so you aren't doing anything wrong. Some people like to create their own drama, let those people alone. You keep taking care of you and the ones you care for. You're doing a great job darlin.", "I don\u2019t think YTA but also maybe it would be easier to work away from children instead of having to \u201cpick and choose\u201d as this will have potential issues", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I am glad you are in therapy. You aren't acting childish, nor are you the a-hole, you have a legitimate reason, if that mom doesn't like it, too bad!", "NTA,  oh my goodness, I'm so sorry. How traumatic. Sending so many hugs.", "NTA, I'm so sorry that happened to Rose, you and Rose's family. \n\nThat's a perfectly reasonable boundary. If you're not getting therapy, I think it could help you grieve, but that doesn't mean your work boundary has to change.", "Absolutely this. This is the kind of parent who would sue the nursery and OOP if her child would have an episode related to her condition (not to mention die) while in their care.", "Heck, I had traumatic labors, my last child birth was a real doosie plus I hated being a mom because my ex was just horrible and 1000% of the stress always fell to me. I legit had ptsd by the time I left him when my last was a year old. I couldn't hold other peoples babies- infants specifically without having a panic attack for 10 years after that. Only in an urgent situation did I take a baby into my arms. \n\nA few pets have died in my arms. My dog, a year ago. I'm still traumatized from that. I had to kill a disemboweled squirrel with my hunting knife to put it out of its misery. I couldn't look at my knife or use it for a couple of weeks without hearing that screech as I did the humane thing...\n\nI cannot even remotely fathom a child... I don't even want to finish typing that sentence. Yeah eff that noise. Op is in therapy and handling things appropriately plus facing their fears by still working with kids. Mom needs to shut the heck up.", "Every child gets to swap out and into a different group every week and she noticed she\u2019s been with all my coworkers at least twice but never been with me", "NTA then if she isn't being stuck in the wrong age group, or with someone she doesn't like, or anything. But if Gina wants to be in your group, she may be feeling like it's her fault you don't want her. Could you maybe talk to your boss about hiring someone more specialised in caring for disabled kids who can help out?", "I\u2019ll look into it thanks 4 the advice", "NTA - but holy hell? What? As an educator I can't imagine leaving an educator alone with a room full of children AND a child with severe special needs - even if they're all asleep. I just... wow. I mean, I've worked in some shitty shitty centres but I'm so sorry. I'm shocked that it wasn't part of \"Rose's\" IEP that she required her own (trained) staff member. Again, I'm so sorry and I hope that none of the other children bore witness to that, and that you were helped quickly by other staff - but I won't make you relive that trauma by answering anything! Just know you're not in the wrong at all.", "Well, I hope you guys are ready for the incoming lawsuit because what you're doing is illegal. You are discriminating against this child based on her medical conditions, which is a protected class.  Under the eyes of the law, what you're doing is no different than refusing to have her in your group because of any other protected characteristic such as her race or her gender. \n\nWhen there comes a situation where the needs of the teacher and the protected characteristics of a student are incompatible, you are legally required to accomadate the student over the teacher. They are not supposed to be removing her from your group because you can't handle her being there. They are supposed to be removing *you* from the group because you can't handle the situation. \n\nYour preference not to have sick kids in your group is not a protected class, nor do you have any sort of documentation that it is a disability.  You have no legal basis to justify accomadations such as removing these children from your group. This child absolutely has documentation of their condition, and not they have documents of your discrimination against them.\n\nYou really need to read the Americans With Disabilities Act. It has a specific section about disabled children and their rights to access daycares and why this is illegal.", "NTA, knowing the context she should be more reluctant to let Gina be in your care in case there's a trauma response (not that there would be, what you went through was awful)", "NTA. So sorry you had to go through that, but also so pleased your workplace has your back. That's pretty priceless.", "i cant even imagine what that kind of traumatic experience does with somebody. Sorry that happend to you and the poor girl. it is praise worthy that you can still work in a nursery. i dont think i could do that even with therapy. \n\nNTA that mom must be a completly empathyless, coldhearted woman", "Nta", "NTA and well done to your boss! Wish there was more like them in the world!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA reasonable boundary. And you are also protecting yourself from liabilities that could easily wipe out yoru future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe AH here is your boss, who shopuld have answered \"planning processes\" - He divulged your medicald data (Mental health invformation), that is very likely a sueable offense that could get him fired if you report it.", "It happens all the time in nursery settings. \n\nNot everyone is equipped to deal with everything so not everyone will care for every child. \n\nSame as having teachers that only work in specific rooms/ age groups because they know Thier strengths and weaknesses.", "that counts as Y\\_T\\_A vote. you have to space it or something", "I have no idea whether that would be a successful lawsuit but I'm pretty sure this situation is not what the ADA was written for. This child is suffering no harm whatsoever. Their right to access daycare has not been impaired. This is simply an employer assigning each employee the tasks they are best suited for.", "Omg NTA and feel awful for you. That woman is so insensitive", "NTA. With what happened, you shouldn\u2019t be put in charge of another kid with heart problems unless/until you are 100% ready to take it on again. It\u2019s best for Gina too\u2014she doesn\u2019t need someone who\u2019s going to anxiously hover over her or freak out every time she has a problem or emotionally distance themselves from her. She needs someone who can treat her like every other little girl and be fully present in her life. There\u2019s no way that you could do that when you\u2019re still processing your past trauma.", "NTA\n\nHaving some level of PTSD from *a child dying in your arms* is not childish. I went to the funeral of a child I never met and I swore to myself I will never go to another one. You are better than me because I think I would be afraid to work around kids in general if that happened to me. The girl is being cared for, so what difference does it make if she's in your care or not? \n\nSidebar: it's not a good idea for staff to be left alone in child care. Aren't there laws about how many adults are supposed to be with the kids at all times? I would speak to someone about this if this is still going on, specifically because of your experience. What if something happened to you, or required you to leave, who would take care of the kids?", "NTA.  \nSometimes self care has to come first. This is one of those times.", "sounds like the kid is well accomodated, and does not miss out on anything due to not rotating to a single caregiver, I think you're wrong about this being discrimination.", "There is such thing as sudden epilepsy death (SUDEP) though. That's likely what they are referring to."]}
