Find someone who you trust who can be more objective than your boyfriend and discuss your options when it comes to your pregnacny.  You do not need to raise this baby if you are not ready to have it.  It would be unfair to the baby to have a mother who is not ready for children or who is uninterested in children.

Look into what is best for you and your mental & physical health.\n\nAs far as your family judging it sounds like they made you raise your siblings so I wouldn\u2019t take any judging they do on children or pregnancy very seriously.", "NTA but it\u2019s not too late to change your mind about keeping and raising this baby.", "NTA - He thought you would grow to love it? Jesus f\\*\\*king christ, way to make stupid assumptions and while coercing someone into anything they do not want is always wrong and very dickheadish behaviour (at best), this is just the epitome of selfish bullying coercion. What the heck..\n\nHaving a child as a couple should be the couple's genuine decision and the potential mother has an absolute veto right here, after all it's her body that will go through those changes. And mind you, even \"good pregnancies\" without any major scares, just the regular little ones, and with a \"good birth\" often bring long-term injuries with them. There's so much that men need to educate themselves on there and that they should be educated before they randomly can become fathers. That bf of yours should not become a father though, certainly not at this stage in his life.

I\u2019m sorry you got bullied and pressured into this pregnancy. I suggest looking into adoption, either with an uninvolved third party (closed adoption is a possibility here) or signing away your parental rights at birth and handing the baby over to the father, and walking away.

And that\u2019s *okay.* You can start looking into options now. Since your boyfriend wanted the baby so much, maybe surrender your parental rights to him. Or look into adoption agencies now, you might find a couple on a waiting list who will be willing to take the baby very soon after birth so the child will be guaranteed a stable home.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry this is happening. Your boyfriend has been very selfish and has shamed you at every turn to get his way. I think you might want to reevaluate your relationship with him, because it sounds like he will *always* put you second.", "NTA \n\nThis is a further trauma you are experiencing. I hope you are still in therapy. Your bf pressured you to have this baby, even though you haven't worked through your past. Shame on him. He was thinking of only himself, and I bet he is going to make you take care of this baby alone because if he thinks you should be happy, he is probably also a sexist.\n\nPlease don't go home for the holidays. You are going to be further traumatized and you don't need that right now. Have you told your bf why you aren't excited? You may want to consider giving up rights and giving the baby to him. You should walk away from him anyway, because he clearly doesn't consider your feelings, physical health, or mental health. He wants what he wants.", "NTA- please go get some help mental help if you can. I am sorry you were talked into a pregnancy you did not want. It isn't fair and it shouldn't have happened. Please know I am not telling you to get help so that you \"love your baby\" or become interested in your pregnancy. Pregnancy can make existing mental illness and trauma a million times worse.

I'm going to agree with the other comments and say to look into seeing if your partner wants the child or find an agency where you can find a family who wants a child (forgive me idk how the adoption agency works). I personally think it's better to know if you aren't ready for a child than force yourself to keep the child and later recent them. But yea your partner is awful if he's forcing you to keep the child. That's just wrong espeically if you feel the child might not have a good life.\n\nSo yea I would look into agencies and find a family who wants a child and don't listen to what your partner says.

I wouldn't wish it on anyone.", "NTA - You didn't want this pregnancy so it's not out of left field that you are uninterested in pregnancy / baby things. Your boyfriend is an asshole. He's basically using the same logic that women do when they are trying to \"fix\" a man (OH I thought for me he would get a job and love it and wouldn't leech off me like he did all the other women). You might need to either A) let you bf raise this child and you only have visitation/ give up rights or B) breakup and give the child up for adoption. Either way I think you need to lose the BF. It's your body that is growing a human child and for him to not listen to you at all and think that you would change your mind after a few weeks has red flags all over it.", "NTA.

At the end of the day you are the one who will be living with this experience and baby for your whole life.\n\n  If you're going to be this uninterested in your pregnancy and the baby afterward it might be better for the child for you to either give it to the father and leave, put them into a safe heaven to be adopted out to another family, or just abort before the 23 week mark (or the legal one in your local area since it varies) passes and you legally can't.\n\nIt's ultimately your choice op. If you don't want this baby you do not have to see it through. Your mental health is important too, and you don't want to pass multigenerational trauma onto your child if you find yourself incapable of bonding with them.\n\nYou need to do some major soul searching and decide what is best for you, and the baby you are carrying.
