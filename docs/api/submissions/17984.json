I became especially close with M (33F) and Y (26F).\n\nI've always found it easier to become friends with women and they're both really interesting, curious people. M is a married lesbian and Y is heterosexual and they both talked about their respective relationships/dating lives, whereas I haven't.\n\nI'm not keeping some big secret, I just don't have a lot to talk about in that department. I occasionally made reference to past relationships, but this was in terms of \"my ex\". Who on earth says \"my female ex\"? I wasn't avoiding the topic, but at no point did I ever say anything about my sexuality.\n\nY did once try and get me to comment on people I thought were attractive at the workplace, but I said I didn't feel comfortable having that conversation in the workplace. \n\nFast forward to now. I had a date this weekend and it went quite well. Yesterday at lunch, M asked me how my weekend was so I told her about the date. Y was sat at the table but was focusing on her phone and wasn't in the conversation. M and I then moved on to other topics and the rest of the day went off without incident.\n\nFast forward to today and Y has moved to the other side of the office. M popped over to ask if everything was ok, and came back telling me I should go speak to her. Well, apparently, not disclosing that I was straight was a gross breach of trust. She let me know personal things she never would have shared if she knew I was straight and she now feels deeply uncomfortable being around me. The words \"preying\" and \"feel preyed upon\" were used more than once.\n\nI immediately backed off and wrote an e-mail to HR to cover myself off. I asked M what they thought and their response was that I had been \"evasive\" about it, but she never for a second assumed I was gay. Her money was actually on asexual, but either way she didn't care. Y hasn't said anything to anyone else as far as I am aware, so I am not concerned about workplace drama or anything, but I still feel awful. She's a good person and I hate that she thinks I was being predatory.\n\nI really don't know if I was the asshole, so AITA?\n\nUpdate - M had a chat with her, got more context and I now understand why she got so angry about it. I don't agree with it and I think she's been very unprofessional, but I at least understand. She's not a bad person, but she's got a very immature attitude to how things work and how to interact with other people and I don't intend on resuming the friendship going forward should she choose to apologise.", "created_utc": 1684845967, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13pni9r/aita_for_not_telling_my_coworker_that_i_am/", "score": 86, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just because you're not \"outing yourself\" doesn't mean you're preying on people, this is ridiculous. Maybe she just assumed you were gay and she's mad at you because she looks like a fool now lol.\n\nIf you don't want to alk about your exs, don't do it.

I\u2019m bi, and while I do primarily date other men, my last long term ex was a girl. Everyone at work assumed I was gay for no actual reason other than stereotypes; because I wasn\u2019t into sports, because I\u2019m an artist, because I \u201cseem gay\u201d.

Just their own assumptions based upon their perception of what a gay man is.\n\nAnyways, its absolutely homophobic of them. Its not homophobic in the obvious \u201chate the gays\u201d way; but its a microaggression. Its assuming someone\u2019s sexuality without asking, and then being treating them a certain way due to their perceived sexuality. Its absolutely unacceptable but unfortunately extremely common and normalized socially. Just\u2026 good luck.", "Nta, actually she is the asshole for making assumptions based on nothing.
