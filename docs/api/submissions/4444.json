You could probably say that I and my husband \"have money\", for example, but we're certainly not wealthy. Yet we've put our names on things - our cars, our house. We own them, we're responsible for them, if something goes wrong it falls on us to make it right. That changes how you view things.\n\nPeople can complain about rent all damn day but if they can't afford a discounted rental rate, they sure as hell can't afford the $7000 repair bill we got for our AC system within a year of moving in. In the nearly 3 years we've lived here, we've had to plan to spend *thousands* on repairs that the previous owner did a pretty good job of hiding. Home ownership is expensive. Renters don't get this. \n\nIt's not their property and they don't think about it until they want their landlord to fix something, which they don't pay for or understand the cost of. Corporate landlords are shit but some guy renting out a room still has to make all major repairs himself and it can get dicey, especially since the cost of repairs increases while they continue to collect a discounted rental fee. For example, our windows are outdated, you can feel a draft coming in which is a total waste of money in and of itself. We got a quote for them in 2020 - $5000. We called them back this year and they now cost ~$7500. That's a 50% increase. If I'm renting for a discounted fee, I'm not increasing that fee, and I'm still on the hook for any repairs that my tenants require, I'm being *more* than generous.\n\nAt the end of the day, if OP didn't own the property, someone else would. Maybe this owner wouldn't rent it out. But that doesn't solve the renter's problem of needing somewhere to live. So we're back to square one, they still need to rent because they can't buy. And those two mindsets are totally different in most cases. It's one of the reasons why renters are too commonly okay with causing damage and letting literal trash build up. Being a solo landlord is a nightmare.\n\nI mentioned in another comment that we're currently housing a friend while he gets on his feet. I already regret the decision because we clearly don't see eye to eye on how to function. My husband and I have busted our asses trying to gain financial security. Our friend clearly hasn't, which we didn't realize until he was already moved in. We always took jobs regardless of whether we liked them, because we needed a paycheck. We lived in places we didn't like, because we needed shelter. We ate shitty food because ramen is cheaper than filet mignon. On the weekends, we went to the mall and window shopped. We sacrificed. \n\nHis friend wants to live in areas *we* can't afford. He doesn't want a roommate. He doesn't want to work certain jobs. And this has been the case his entire adult life, even when he did rent a place his modus operandi was \"do that which makes me happy\". Which is why when he had an accident in 2018, he had no foundation to return to. And yet still, after 3+ years of living off other people, he behaves the same.\n\nThat isn't to say that all poor people are like this. I'm a librarian, it's my job to empathize and help. But you can't ignore the fact that some people do not live their lives in a way that leads to success, of any kind. The top comment in this chain is an example - he wants to live where he wants, he doesn't want to pay, he's pissed that he does, he thinks people should pay their mortgage and give him stuff for free. He likely won't experience much success in life. The \"poor me\" attitude just doesn't produce security.

However, utilities have severely gone up. With leases ending soon in a few months, my parents notified the tenants that their rent will have to go up upon renewal to cover the increased utility costs. Utility bills from the last 6 months were also shown.

If they want more space- which was previously being paid for by the former occupants of that space- then they have to pay for it. You could just as easily have rented the master to a new couple. It wouldn\u2019t change anything for them. They are the ones being selfish. \n\nNTA", "They have silly logic.  Your finances are none of their business.  If we were all being logical here, they should be paying market rent for the space.  But you're charging less than that.  They were getting a deal and were too dumb to keep it.", "This, its really amazing to me that everyone in here is cheerleading giving up the house just to teach a lesson to a  few randoms. \n\nOP should do what's in his best financial interest. Its probably better to keep the house, rent it out at MARKET rent.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking, I just wanted to be sure that the people talking about sharing were indeed the separate roommates in either room. Some people just have no shame! Or maybe they don\u2019t have enough sense to have shame. Like in what world did they think op was going to move out, get a little more from the couple for a bigger space, maintain the home and associated insurance and taxes, PAY FOR A PLACE TO LIVE and somehow have this extra money to just be giving away square footage to people who are already getting a very sweet deal. All that tells me is they have NO clue what it means to work for something and everything has been handed to them. They probably don\u2019t even pay their own rent (but might have told the parents they needed more for the office).", "After a couple of disastrous roommates in college, I decided that unrelated adults should not live together unless they were also sleeping together.  You need some way to blow off all that tension!  I realize that people right now don't have much choice but to rent rooms to/from virtual strangers, but mostly those stories reinforce my beliefs.", "My best friend of 15+ years moved in with me when her dad passed away. She lived in another state and had no one there. She was only supposed to live with me for a few months. It turned into 3 years. She always paid her rent and was clean and, oh yeah, my BEST friend, so I never pushed her to move out. In fact, we ended up getting a bigger house together. Well, that\u2019s where shit got real. \n\nShe still paid rent and all, but started drinking excessively and becoming really verbally abusive to my 12 year old daughter. Who, by the way, I\u2019m pretty sure loved her more than I did. Before she moved in with us, her and my daughter would text each other often, and she would always send my kid Christmas and birthday gifts. They loved each other. But she would drink and apparently say some really nasty things to my kid about how she was a piece of shit and just like her dad (dad is a drug addict and super manipulative and hasn\u2019t been in her life since she was 6). My daughter just took it and never told me. \n\nOne day she called me at work crying and telling me she had my sister pick her up because roommate was day drinking and just really laying into her and saying some pretty horrific shit. That was it. I told her to leave. But she was on the lease. She agreed to move in 2 months, but was taking herself off the lease. It was a terrible 2 months, and in the end, I was stuck with a bigger house than I needed/could afford and she stiffed me for the 2 months rent and stole a bunch of shit when she left. She also abandoned her cat with us. (That part was fine. We love him and she treated him badly anyway). \n\nTo top it off, rent increases in the area have made living in this house the only affordable option. Even moving yo a 2 bedroom apartment would cost me more than staying where I am since I\u2019ve been here so long. So even though I can\u2019t necessarily afford it, I can\u2019t really afford to move either. \n\nAnd of course, I lost my best friend of over 15 years.", "I'm seriously going to include that plus, \"give an inch...\" in a future agreement when my current roommate moves. He's been wonderful and I've generally been very lucky but it hurts so much when it happens that IMHO it should be discussed up front.", "If you are getting your place FOR UNDER MARKET, then it matters ZERO how much benefit the owner is getting.  You are BOTH WINNING. Whinging because they are making a profit?  SO WEIRD.  MOVE then- go to a market rate apartment and pay more.  How this logic works inter illogical heads is a mystery to me.", "INFO where you trying to charge the two single residence the full rent that used to be paid by the couple? Or just some small amount for the extra room?", "Are you the asshole?  \n\nWell, you are a landlord so there is no avoiding a base level of assholery.\n\nThat being said, nothing you said or did in your post was out of line with accepted norms of renting a room.\n\nWhether you are being greedy or not is a separate question.  Raising the rent or changing the terms at the end of a lease are not abnormal if the overall situation is changing.\n\nIf all your friends and tenants are upset with you then there is probably more to the story than you are disclosing here.", "NAH. They were in their rights to try to negotiate a better deal for themselves and you were in your rights to sell your property and walk away. Business is business.", "ESH\n\n>Between the four of them I collect enough to cover the mortgage and utilities with a little left over. \n\nFour people are buying you a house. Just because it is normal, doesn't make it any less of an asshole move.", "YTA. You own an asset (the house) that is going up in value.  The rent your currently receive covers all your costs for maintaining that asset. You have arranged a deal to earn even more money for doing no additional work (from the couple). Now you want even more money for no additional work (from the singles). This is extractive, rent seeking behaviour and it sucks.\n\nThe only justification for this is that you charge below market rent. So what? Other landlords might be bigger AH, but that doesn't stop you being an AH.", ">Between the four of them I collect enough to cover the mortgage and utilities with a little left over. I save my money and use it to pay for major repairs and maintenance. \n\nYTA for this alone. You paid nothing towards the mortgage? Shoveling your \"massive\" mortgage onto others and living scot-free makes you an asshole.", "You don\u2019t have roommates, you have people that pay your mortgage for you. The fact that you demand a deposit and two months worth of rent is outrageous.\nYou are a wage thief and yes, YTA.", "This is pure landlord greed though. OP is making more money  for no additional work from the couple that live there. And OP already made enough to cover the mortgage +maintenance before that. Sure they'll have costs in their new city but they don't have the right to extract money to cover those costs from their tenants.", "Bad analogy since in this instance the tenants were paying OP's mortgage with some left over...who is feeding who?", "There was no good deed here lol. The landlord is making more money for less work its purely extractive behaviour that adds no value to the economy.", "Talk about not caring for others", "It\u2019s a saying meaning don\u2019t piss off the person you are reliant on", "Landlord was providing rent under market value for friends of a friend and then they complalined about having to pay more to get more space.", "There are often limits on the number of rooms you can rent singly before it falls under rooming house when the landlord doesn't live in the same property. It really depends on where you are, where I am it's 7 and 8 falls under rooming house.", "Ummmm the roommates paid enough money to cover the entire mortgage, the utilities, with profit left over, while OP lived there earning equity without having to shell out any of their own income for housing costs and while making a profit off people who got nothing back for what they paid. That\u2019s the excess profit. They paid enough to subsidize the entirety of OP\u2019s housing costs and then some.", "Yes i know. Landlords are greedy which is why 'market values' are high. OP can be less of an AH than other landlords and still be an AH", "OP could have rented the rooms out at full price and made a greater profit, but chose not to. In OPs generosity they lost some of their profit. It\u2019s not fair to say all landlords are one certain way. Your sweeping generalization doesn\u2019t allow for the nuance of reality. \n\nI do agree that most governments can (and should) do a lot more to ease the hardship of its citizens. I also hate that affordable housing is becoming more and more difficult to find. I\u2019m with you on wanting a solution. I just don\u2019t agree that it\u2019s helpful or accurate to vilify a grad school student who made a smart investment and lowered the price of rent for their tenants.", "Some places also distinguish between households", "You're getting down voted for literally restating the facts laid out in OP's post. Jeez.", "The roommates did get something back. They got a place to live at lower than market prices. That\u2019s huge and something that was not owed to them. If they wanted to build equity they could have taken the risk and bought if they were in a position to do so. If they were not, they could have used this opportunity that was kindly provided to them by OP to save the money they would have spent on paying full market price rent. Instead, they chose to take advantage of OP\u2019s generosity, ask for more, and then complain about it, slandering OP\u2019s name. They were also not subsidizing OP\u2019s housing costs. They were paying OP for something OP was giving them (again at a reduced rate).", "I think by definition if you are taking less than you could take, you're not \"greedy\".  So why don't you tell us what you would do if you were a landlord?", "I\u2019m sure it\u2019s also in part because of continued disagreement with my other comments.", "A place to live IS owed to you when paying someone rent.\n\nYou also seem to be under the impression that the only reason someone might not be in the position to buy is risk aversion. You must know, of course, that there are many other possible reasons.", "I wouldn't be a landlord, they provide nothing of value and want money for nothing.", "Some stuff isn't fair though, there are systematic issue that need addressing.", "What an asshole.", "How dare these peasants ask for MORE space! They've had the pleasure of being good little tenants and paying my mortgage. And now they want MORE! \n\nNO, I shall sell my property and reap my deserved, no, hard earned value increase!\n\nThe cheek.\n\nAH", "Yeah my parents had a rental that they handled remotely for a long time and it was a massive pain in the ass.", "NTA Exactly! And covering mortgage with a little more isn't enough.. Assurance, the time you spend doing administrative stuff, repairs and all cost a fortune! I would need to be paid to become a landlord", "How are either of those questions relevant?", "Even if the mortgage is less,  they still took the initiative of using their savings and/or taking out a loan with interest.  It's not a net zero transaction", "That kind of stupidity is probably why you're a home owner and they managed to play themselves out of a sweet rental situation.", "Yep, lost two friends I thought I was helping out (while also getting a bit of help towards my expenses (co-op, so a bit different) ). It ended up costing me a lot of money!", "Sadly they do have that right. But shouldn't!", "She messed up. 425 for all that is a steal. You can't even find a place for just 425. Even minus the utilities. As far as I know. Let alone all that.", "Yes! Had a former friend who didn't like her living situation and wanted to move in with my spouse and me because we had a 2nd bdrm, for an indefinite time, for free. We only had one bath, the space was tiny, and we filled it with just the two of us as it was. She had parents close by who would take her in, she just didn't want to. She 100% felt owed that space, and it contributed to the end of our friendship because she got weird about it.", "I am a landlord and you are absolutely correct. \nIt's blowing my mind how few people on this thread realise that. Especially the renter's!!??", "Yep, my parents were landlords for over 30 years. When they had a good tenant, they rarely raised the rent and, when the did, it was always just to cover increased costs on their end. We had one tenant for 10 years. During that time, they increased his rent just $50/month because of utility increases. It was definitely a win/win, we had a great tenant and he had below market rent, which made him want to stay. He only ended up moving because the company he worked for was bought out and he had to move out of the area for his job. We were both very sad.", "i don\u2019t think it\u2019s to teach a lesson i think it\u2019s cause he\u2019s moving and feels it\u2019ll be a headache", "Literally! Amazed at how few \"tenants\" on this thread seem to understand this.", "YTA", "I am in the same situation. It's nice for once seeing Reddit NOT go 'Landlords BAD, tenants being EXPLOITED'. It's very often the other way around. I am currently freezing my butt off in minus 4 C (outside obviously) because I can't really afford to turn the heat on , still better than having a roomie/tenant destroying my home.", "I was saying that it wasn\u2019t owed to the renters to be offered a below market price. OP was offering what they were not owed (lower rent) as an act of kindness. Of course they were owed a place to live when paying the agreed upon price.\n\nI am not under that impression, but nice try! At the same time, OP was taking the risk and deserves to benefit from that.\n\nEdit to add: in this case both OP and the tenants benefited from OP taking the risk since OP offered rates lower than they could have found elsewhere. (If OP hadn\u2019t taken the risk they would have had to pay more in rent somewhere else).", "I believe partially. I don't know the details but the tenant applied for government rent relief. The government paid a portion but the remaining balance owed is between the tenant and landlord. The only way to recoup the rest of the unpaid rent is to legally go after the tenant, which my parents are planning on doing.\n\nThat's horrible that the other property owner didn't get their money back. I've heard some small landlords are frustrated and  now want to get out of renting property and just sell. And some of them wind up selling to those corporations that are buying single family homes or apartments, who then jack up the rent."]}
