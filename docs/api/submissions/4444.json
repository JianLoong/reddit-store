I still required a lease agreement and security deposit as well as first and last month's rent.  I just was willing to rent to them at below market rate because i didn't have to advertise or arrange for a property manager.  \n\nBetween the four of them I collect enough to cover the mortgage and utilities with a little left over.  I save my money and use it to pay for major repairs and maintenance.  \n\nWe I will be starting a new job in a different city in the new year.  I knew about this back in late October.  I offered the couple an opportunity to take over the basement suite in the new year for a little bit more money.  They would get a massive bedroom upgrade and a private living room, bathroom, and kitchen. They agreed and let me know that they were planning on moving out in one year so they would be willing to sign a one year lease. \n\nI asked the two singles if either of them wanted to take the master bedroom that would be empty.  They both declined but asked if they could turn it into a home office for them. I said sure but they would have to cover the rent for the room.  \n\nThey think I am being unreasonable. Since I will be making more money off the couple they think I should keep their rent the same and let them have the room for free.  I offered it to them for 80% of what I was getting before. They called me a selfish asshole for taking all their money.  Even if they took the deal they would still be paying less than market value for a single room in our city.  \n\nIt turned into a huge fight with the people who referred them to me calling me a greedy asshole for trying to suck money out of their friends.  \n\nI don't need to deal with any of this.  I found a property investor who was willing to buy my house and honor my current leases including the new one for the couple.  \n\nUnfortunately for the other two renters their leases are up in February and I imagine that the rents will be going up a fair bit.  But that isn't my problem any more.  \n\nSo now everyone they know are angry with me because these two people will most likely have to move into a crappier living situation.  \n\nI feel bad because if I wasn't moving I would stay and deal with it.

I might be the asshole because I didn't have time or desire to negotiate with them so I sold it to someone who will raise their rents to market rate.

If you weren't going to be there to take care of the house you would have to pay someone to do it.  This seems like the right decision for you.  They blew their sweet deal by being greedy themselves.", "NTA! \n\nEveryone wants something for free and that they want you to allow them to use space that they refuse to pay for is ridiculous. It\u2019s their own fault that they got other people involved and made this untenable for you. Don\u2019t carry any feelings about it. Walk away with your profit and enjoy your new life!", "NTA. You aren\u2019t required to give away rental space for free and it is your business what you decide to do with your property. \n\nIt isn\u2019t like you are a slum lord who just unilaterally and arbitrarily hiked their rent. You offered them more space for more money. (And still below market.) If they didn\u2019t want to pay more, they easily could have just said no. Instead they chose to get entitled and call you names. Who does that to their landlord and expect there to be zero consequences? \n\nThey made it clear that managing this property from a distance would be a headache so you made the reasonable decision to sell it.", "NTA. Why would they think they would get the room for free? Also you own the place so it's yours to sell to whom ever you wish and now that it's theirs they can do whatever they like with the property.", "NTA. If their leases are up and you are gone by then, it's their tough luck because they did not want to compromise. They had a pretty sweet deal, and looks like even with the increase, they were still bring offered a sweet deal. They wanted to take advantage of your goodwill.", "NTA.  These two renters are the definition of entitled.  Did they think you were going to leave the other room empty. Of course you were going to rent it out. If they wanted it for an office, they would need to pay.  I hope they\u2019ll be very happy when you sell the property and their rent goes up.  Laugh all the way to the bank.", "NTA. If they wanted to use that room, they should pay for it", "NTA.\n\nThey were in the fuck around stage and have graduated to the find out stage.\n\nPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "NTA\n\nThey wanted more room for themselves but didn't want to pay any more rent. They were trying to rip you off, not the other way around.", "NTA. You made them a reasonable offer and they wanted to complain about it. As for your original friends that recommended them and what they think, try paying your mortgage with their opinion. Unless they are willing to put up, they can shut up. It might sound mean but that's life. My guess is they got the half of the story that makes the other side look good.", "NTA don\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you", "NTA but you keep making excuses for these people, I wish I'd had you as a landlord when I rented, I woulda talked you way down on my rent, don't ever be a landlord again.", "NTA\n\nJust because it\u2019s a room and not a whole separate apartment doesn\u2019t change the fact that they\u2019re paying for a certain amount of space.  If they didn\u2019t claim that room for themselves, regardless of what it\u2019s being used for, you could rent it out to another tenant.  If they want to claim the room, it\u2019s pretty reasonable they should have to pay for it.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, you\u2019re allowed to sell your property if you want to.\n\nIm generally not a fan of landlords, because I\u2019ve seen a fair share of them being scummy, but you do not seem like the unreasonable one here.", "Nta.

This is always the risk when doing business with friends or friends of friends - they expect to not have to pay market rates. You are well within your legal and moral rights to make legitimate business decisions about an investment.", "NTA. Don't complain about the situation and then complain when it's gone. You don't owe them free housing. It seems like you were just using their money to cover costs and maintenance anyways.

Their friends aren't helping either by siding with them.", "NTA. I rephrase it for you: AITA for not letting people ripping me off and therefore get accused of ripping them off? It\u2019s your house. These people are your renters and not your friends or family. You offered them a fair deal. They spit in your face. Tough luck.", "NTA. Your two single tenants ought not to have bitten the hand that feeds them. Were they not to have been so selfish they wouldn't find themselves faced with having to look for alternative accommodation which will be inferior. For heaven's sake it is your property so do as you will with it, I can guarantee they wouldn't do you any favours, based on their attitude you explained. You could be really petty and buy them a two person tent for when they leave so they won't be completely homeless.", "NTA.... I don't know what country this is but I know where I live even if the house is sold and the new owner takes over with still renting once the lease is up they can't increase the rent just because. They can only increase rent once in a 12-month period and have to give 90 days' written notice and can only go up the legal limit set out by the landlord and tenant board.", "NTA. Business is business. Why should they get a room for free", "NTA something about fucking around and finding out", "NTA, we had a similar situation here earlier this year, tenants were getting a great deal  onpared to houses in the area like half what it normally would be, and we wanted to sell it cause they were starting to trash the place and blame it on improper maintenance, needless to say we will always have a written contract from now on.", "NTA, though if I were you I wouldn't let those specific rentors being dumb jerks make you lose a good source of income. Maybe hire someone to manage all the renting processes so you don't have to deal with it and give them a cut of the income from it, put the rent back to a more standard rate for the area (once the current contracts end of course), and move away keeping the rent from the house as a continuous stream of passive income.", "NTA. They've been living off your generosity in the form of lower rent for a long time. Regardless of what they thought, it was a business arrangement.  They screwed the pooch, they get to deal with the puppies.", "I wish I had you as a landlord, I would\u2019ve taken up that offer or if I couldn\u2019t, at least declined nicely. Geez, what a pair of dummies.", "NAH.\n\nConsidering you are moving for a job which has begun all of this, I am going to assume that you aren\u2019t a landlord that was on your arse and having these 4 people pay your mortgage off as you sat idle over your property. That, to say, you paid for some of it alongside these 4 people and it was from your job, not from these 4 people, that you derived your primary source of income. The rooms you used probably went into the payment for the house, and if you\u2019re gonna vacate now because of your job, it\u2019s reasonable to expect for the people who will use those rooms going forward pay for the extra space.\n\nWith that being said, if they outright declined to use that space even for their \u201chome office\u201d idea, what would you do? Bring in an extra tenant? By vacating and expecting the two single tenants to cover your vacancy, you put them into a very weird situation. It\u2019s definitely made even worse that you have now forced their hand by outright selling the house and made it so they now have to leave. But at the end of the day, you moving on to the next stage of your life isn\u2019t something that has to be asked permission of, and to sell the house if you\u2019re no longer going to be in the area is an acceptable thing to do.\n\nTenants weren\u2019t in the wrong for feeling shortchanged, and neither are you for wanting to be rid of the mess of having to constantly figure out a property in another city from where you will live. No one seems to be in the wrong.", "Yeah but I know that they are going to have to move into much less desirable housing. Or accept much, much longer commutes. And while we aren't really friends, we are friendly.", "I think that their thought process was that I would still be collecting more rent after I moved out.  They didn't consider that I would have to pay for housing myself when I move.", "What they said was that I would still be getting the same amount of money after I moved out. Even a little more. But I have to pay for housing when I move. And I don't need to now.", "Exactly. I bet they'd hate it if OP put another couple in there.", "Not planning on it.  I just needed a place to stay while I did my post grad and thought it was a good investment.", "I could have had a renter in it no problem.  And used that money to pay for a property management company.", "Lots of landlords rent out individual rooms instead of entire units.", "I just liked having a cheap place to live while I was in school.", "Here once the lease is up you either sign a new lease agreement or go month to month at a higher rate.", "My plan was to rent that room and use the money to pay a property management company.", "Hey, that\u2019s not your problem.  They acted like aholes, now they pay the price.  Saves you a lot of headaches.", "Then they shouldn't have bitten the hand that houses them. NTA", "Friendly should be the default setting when interacting with people. They aren't reciprocating your kindness and you don't owe them anything. NTA.", "So? You offered them a great deal which they argued about. If they end up with a crappy deal it's because they didn't take you up on your offer. NTA", "There\u2019s a reason it\u2019s suggested not to do business with friends or family\u2026..", "Exactly. If you were going to maintain two homes, you\u2019d need to account for that. I find your tenants\u2019 behavior really bizarre. I\u2019m all for affordable rent but getting angry and abusive because you didn\u2019t want to give them more room for free makes no sense. It sounds like you were a decent and considerate landlord and they have zero chill. \n\nI suppose the other option would have been to find a new tenant for that room, but I can easily see how that might have been a problem for them too.", "Exactly. That's reasonable. I see nothing greedy in your behavior. You were actually making sure they all lived in a better situation with what you were doing.", "That's a shitty deal. Once the lease is up here you still go month to month if you don't sign a new lease but the rent can't be jacked up. No matter what you are NTA I wish you the best of luck in your new journey.", "Yeah, that\u2019s fair enough. \n\nOn the merits of the events in question, expecting free space for nothing is unrealistic. I wouldn\u2019t call it an asshole move on their part still because, for all they know, you were the typical landlord and had the 4 of them paying your mortgage in full anyway and extra charges just sounds on its face like you\u2019re looking to squeeze further, but you\u2019re not the asshole for expecting something extra for something extra, especially since it does seem like you weren\u2019t just sitting on other people\u2019s money. \n\nThis is just one of those things where you\u2019re not obligated to put up with it, and they\u2019re not obligated to appreciate a sudden rise in rent because their landlord is moving on. I don\u2019t know what to tell you about their friends ganging up on you though, because everyone loves a villain \ud83d\ude05 \nBut I do wish you the best in your new job and to hopefully salvage some of those relationships from, how it seems to be, a misunderstanding.", "That was my plan. Rent that room and use the money to pay for a property management company. To cut the grass, shovel snow, and do maintenance. That sort of thing."]}
