Maybe hire someone to manage all the renting processes so you don't have to deal with it and give them a cut of the income from it, put the rent back to a more standard rate for the area (once the current contracts end of course), and move away keeping the rent from the house as a continuous stream of passive income.", "NTA.

That, to say, you paid for some of it alongside these 4 people and it was from your job, not from these 4 people, that you derived your primary source of income. The rooms you used probably went into the payment for the house, and if you\u2019re gonna vacate now because of your job, it\u2019s reasonable to expect for the people who will use those rooms going forward pay for the extra space.\n\nWith that being said, if they outright declined to use that space even for their \u201chome office\u201d idea, what would you do? Bring in an extra tenant? By vacating and expecting the two single tenants to cover your vacancy, you put them into a very weird situation. It\u2019s definitely made even worse that you have now forced their hand by outright selling the house and made it so they now have to leave. But at the end of the day, you moving on to the next stage of your life isn\u2019t something that has to be asked permission of, and to sell the house if you\u2019re no longer going to be in the area is an acceptable thing to do.\n\nTenants weren\u2019t in the wrong for feeling shortchanged, and neither are you for wanting to be rid of the mess of having to constantly figure out a property in another city from where you will live.
