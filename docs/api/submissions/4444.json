Maybe hire someone to manage all the renting processes so you don't have to deal with it and give them a cut of the income from it, put the rent back to a more standard rate for the area (once the current contracts end of course), and move away keeping the rent from the house as a continuous stream of passive income.", "NTA.

That, to say, you paid for some of it alongside these 4 people and it was from your job, not from these 4 people, that you derived your primary source of income.

Bring in an extra tenant? By vacating and expecting the two single tenants to cover your vacancy, you put them into a very weird situation. It\u2019s definitely made even worse that you have now forced their hand by outright selling the house and made it so they now have to leave. But at the end of the day, you moving on to the next stage of your life isn\u2019t something that has to be asked permission of, and to sell the house if you\u2019re no longer going to be in the area is an acceptable thing to do.\n\nTenants weren\u2019t in the wrong for feeling shortchanged, and neither are you for wanting to be rid of the mess of having to constantly figure out a property in another city from where you will live.

If they do not like the terms, they are free to move. \\[I am a landlord, btw.\\] Honestly, they want free space, and they call you greedy. No, they are clueless.", "NTA.  You aren't obligated to provide housing at below-market prices and you are also not required to hold onto property you no longer need.  You don't owe favors to your former tenants/roommates just because they are friends of friends.", "NTA. They should\u2019ve realized a good deal when they had one", "NTA. Perhaps they shouldn't have given you a hard time about the generous deal you were giving them.", "NTA. They wanted free upgrades to their current living situation. No landlord would allow that without compensation. It\u2019s the property that you own and you decided to sell it while still honoring current leases.", "NTA, imagine paying under market rate for rent and then asking for another room for free, tf? They're gonna learn real quick how much of a deal they were getting.", "NTA, Personally I wouldn't have sold the house. I'd rent out that room to someone else and raise rent when leases are up. If they feel like it's unfair they can always find somewhere better, right?", "NTA. Their living situations aren\u2019t your responsibility. And if your friends are getting mad at you for not facilitating your tenants\u2019 lifestyles\u2026 well I don\u2019t think you need fiends like that. \nYour tenants pay rent so you can pay the mortgage. If they don\u2019t pay the rent, the mortgage is not gonna get paid. Pretty straightforward! \nAlso, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re gonna be making more money at the new job. Why should you sacrifice your salary so they can live a more comfortable life? That\u2019s not a realistic expectation to place on you, even if you were making millions.", "NTA,\n\nIt's your house and you are not running a charity. You are doing this to make money. But it's your fault for offering them below market rates and going even lower to offer them the master bed. As they say \"give them an inch they will take a foot\". You have learned your lesson now, NEVER,  I mean NEVER rent out to friends or family. They always feel entitled to more than they pay for even if what they pay is a joke. Plus all the drama from your friends and family. I would have shut them up the moment they tried to interfere saying if you were so butt hurt you can couch up the difference or let them stay at your place at your desired rate. If not then shut up and don't interfere in my business. And since you and they decided to act like greedy Ah's I will be charging the market rate on renewal of leases and if they cannot pay they can move out and find accommodations that are at par with the pittance they are paying. \n\nThey were fools who failed to realize what a sweet deal they were getting and you were doing them a favor for renting out at such low rates.

I would probably have kept the property, handed it over to a management company and told them they will have to deal with the new management company for room rental negotiations.

It's your house, and you were already giving them a good deal.", "NTA. Are you supposed to provide discounted housing to them forever? You're moving.

Some are good and some are bad just like any other business. You are and were going to be renting them rooms for less than market value and they decided that was unreasonable. Cool, so you sold the property. Now they can deal with the new landlord. New landlords almost always raise the rent because they did BUY the property at market value and need to cover that cost.

They literally asked you, a stranger for all intents and purposes, to give them something worth at least several hundred dollars per month for free and are getting everyone angry at you for saying no? Not sure how your friends who referred them are justifying this but I don't get it.", "NTA, you weren\u2019t running a charity.  It was a business arrangement.  You gave them a reasonable offer and they stomped on it.  They played stupid games and ended up with an expensive stupid prize.", "NTA. Why should you give money away. Sort of same but different: My wife and I own a holiday home. We sometimes rent it out in people in need, like family in distress. When we do this, we ask 750 a month, while renting it as a holiday home gets us a minimal 2.000 a month. This money is not just an extra, it is our business, it keeps our family going. \n\nOne time, after 3 months, we asked a family member to move out, because high season was coming. She got angry and this became a fight with a part of the family. We where obsessed by money, we were antisocial etc etc. \n\nMy wife shut their shit down real quick by asking how many where prepared to give away 1250 a month, and if not, if all complainers could get together and create a fund, because we have a family to feed, and house to pay. We even showed them our bills. Of course, no one payed up. No one wanted their family member stay at their home.  In the end she got priority access to community housing. But still a touchy subject.", "NTA you were helping them out you should have been charging enough to also keep up with maintenance and a little left over for yourself", "NTA. I don't understand their way of thinking. You would have had a vacant room and you would have a new tenant, it's not like they were entitled to the room in any way. That they came up asking to use the room for no fee is quite absurd in the first place. Doesn't make sense to me.", "NTA. You offered them a great deal and they threw it in your face. Karma.", "NTA. I would feel bad in this situation too but honestly it isn\u2019t your problem if they now have to pay more. Maybe if they were friendlier about the office situation and were just like yeah cool! Also it sounds like they want a friends treatment when you just consider being friendly with them. But even if I was renting from a good friend I wouldn\u2019t argue if they asked for what you are asking for. So really not good friends of yours if they consider themselves such. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to worry at all about being the asshole in the situation, you stood up for yourself and I\u2019m proud of you for it!", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA.

You're not responsible for their living situation.", "NTA they are because of the way they were taking advantage of your kindness, you did everything and they wanted more. Good for you!!", "NTA they were used to cheap rents and wanted to take advantage of the situation.  They screwed around and have to deal with the consequences.  Enjoy your new life.", "NTA.  \n\nYour financials are irrelevant here.  \n\nThe upstairs bedroom is a rentable unit.  They wanted a rentable unit for free.  \n\nPlay stupid games win stupid prizes- they killed their golden goose (you) by trying to get even more discounts out of you and berating you for not giving them an apartment for free.  Now they are back to paying market rent.  Boo hoo.", "So its greedy that he doesn't want to give up money (since not renting out that room and instead letting them use it as an office would be giving up money), but they're not greedy for wanting him to give up that free money so they can have a home office for free?", "They could have had their same space for the same amount of money. They wanted the now vacant room for free to use.

It does not matter the relation. A vacancy arose. He can either rent it to Tennants as a office or add more people to the home.  You don't give out freebies just because you may know them well.", "Okay, so follow that logic.  He\u2019s moving anyway, which means he has to, wait for it, sell the house.

That's it. No guilt to be had here. Now you are doing what you need to do since you're moving away. This is how life works.    \nTo all your bitchy friends - I personally would outline how much of a discount you've given them over the years, how much money they've saved as a result and the current market price vs the offer you gave them.
