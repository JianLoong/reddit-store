It's good that your wife is so responsible and pro-active about managing finances and not wasting money on silly things. It also sounds like she's great at finding alternative options to socialise so your still seeing friends and aren't excluded. I hope you are telling her how much you appreciate all she is doing.\nI can also understand that you don't want to appear broke to your friends and it can feel embarrassing and uncomfortable.\nInstead of saying \"we can't afford to\", maybe you and your wife could tell your friends \"we're focusing on saving money right now\" to prevent misunderstanding. There are a lot of people in this situation at the moment, and I'm sure your friends will understand.", "NAH, I understand both of you.\n\nDoes your budget actually include fun money for each of you privately?\n\nWe pool resources, and pay ourselves a fixed amount of fun money each month, precisely for enjoying life.\n\nI'd suggest making that a fixed part of your budget and putting it into your own, non-shared account.", "A good budget has budget allocated for going out for drinks/food so you should agree on how often/much.\nAlso simply explain to your friends you are on a budget challenge", "NAH, however, discuss and add a line item for entertainment in the budget.  Also, discuss short and long term savings goals, ie., new car, vacations, home and retirement.", "NAH- it\u2019s good your wife is trying to save money. It\u2019s also fine to want to have a little fun, we only are on this earth once. \n\nNext time you are doing the weekly budget, add some for a fun date night. Maybe set some extra aside for therapy for both of you as well so you can communicate better and try to talk to your wife why she is being so paranoid about finances.", "NAH. You should probably get a bit more involved in your family's finances. 50% of your monthly income doesn't say much, depending on what amounts of money you earn and what kind of money you need on a rainy day.\n\nA compromise could be a second shared account, where you put money reserved for fun things you both do with your friends.", "NAH, but only as long as you get yourself involved and help your wife reassess your financial strategy.\n\nI know from firsthand experience that it\u2019s difficult to start feeling comfortable about spending again after going through a tight spot. You are no longer broke but you keep worrying about \u201cwhat if\u201ds, and you don\u2019t know when to stop building up the safety cushion. Well it sounds like you guys can afford to live a little more pleasantly now, so sit with your wife, look over the budget with her and include some fun money in your weekly expenses. It\u2019s perfectly okay if she remains in charge if that\u2019s what works for you guys, but you can\u2019t approve a budget and then blame your wife when you feel embarrassed, it\u2019s not fair.", "NAH\n\nMaybe you are a little too worried about the appearance of your finances, maybe you don't want to worry your friends and family. Maybe your wife should learn to be a little more flexible on the fly, maybe she is only so good at setting goals and reaching them because she knows to stick to her guns.\n\nIt sounds like maybe the most simple solution would be to talk about how you talk, if she can save money without implying to your friends that you *need* money, that would be a win-win, right?", "Your wife is correct, you **reviewed** the family budget and **agreed** to it, now you complain as if she made the budget decisions all by herself. You want the benefit of your wife\u2019s hard work without doing even the bare minimum of paying attention and offering your input **when you were asked.** Instead you blame her after the fact, just because your friend\u2019s question embarrassed you. Yeah, YTA.", "YTA- if you do agree to the budget, then you approve not spending more than what's in your spending account. She does not go telling people that you're broke, she only says you're on a budget which IS true. Since you agreed not to spend more than the 50%, you cannot really go out as much as you'd like. How about, instead of telling her of for stating facts, discuss the budget, change it up, agree to have some \"entertainment allowance\" which you could spend on night outs.", "NTA You\u2019re saving 50% but you\u2019re not enjoying life. What\u2019s the point?", "INFO: How much savings do you have? Enough for six months if you were both laid off? More?", "YTA\n\n1. Your wife isn't saying you're broke, she's saying you have a budget. She's right that you are being shallow about her being straightforward about that.\n2. You review the budget. She puts in the work to manage your finances and you don't bother to think about it when you review it, and then complain when she holds to the budget. If you don't like the spending limits, make the effort to give some input.\n\nYour friend asked if you needed help. So what? All you needed to do was tell him 'nah we're good we're just saving hard atm' but instead you complained that your wife is very on top of your finances, which is a good thing for you, and didn't even consider maybe taking some responsibility for said finances instead, as your wife apparently asks you to do weekly.", "YTA - it sounds from your post that you\u2019ve put all the financial stress onto her. Are you fully involved in all of the bills and actually know where you are financially? Are there goals that need to be readjusted? Also if you are just giving final approval on the weekly budget why aren\u2019t you saying hey let\u2019s put aside some extra money for x,y,z? And then having a real conversation about the finances. Don\u2019t happily go along with this budgeting that she\u2019s doing all the work on and then getting upset later bc a friend checked in with you out of concern.", "YTA. If you want to go out with friends, work that into the budget you discuss weekly. Don\u2019t just ok it and then complain you don\u2019t like it.", "NTA. To be worried about \"appearances\" is one thing when it's a keeping-up-with-the-Joneses situation, but another thing when you are genuinely worrying your friends that you're having financial problems. \n\nSurely your wife can understand that she's giving people a false impression that you might be in need of help?\n\nIf she doesn't see that, then you have to be more assertive in setting the weekly budget. She's not wrong in saying you approve her budget every week; so stop doing that.", "Yes, YTA here.  You are accepting her budgetary guidance by default since you probably don't want to be involved in the process or just basically don't save well.  Tell your friends you are just being frugal given the current state of the economy.", "YTA. The two of you are obviously not on the same page, when it comes to savings, but your wife is responsible for finances. And it is shallow to worry about appearances. You don't have to be broke in order to stay away from bars and restaurants. If your priorities are different those of your friend's merely explain this to them.", "NTA. If tou save that much, she can transfer funds when you planned something with friends. Or make an agreement of a weekly 'funbudget' used for little things that can be saved up for bigger outings as a compromise. If you really only have that budget, shes great handling it but you dont.", "Ok, so your wife is obviously extremely stressed and in need, and your reaction is to lecture her for making you look bad? Yeah, no, I don't see the problem here either. \n\nYTA. Help your wife feel better instead of only caring about the effect her stress has on you. FFS, you'd think you loved your wife and like...cared about her wellbeing since you married her. Weird that you don't show it.", "YTA", "Slight YTA because if you haven\u2019t asked how would she know that going out with friends should be included in the budget? Ask her to make a post for that next time and see how she reacts.", "Nah I understand wanting to do things perhaps a bargain could be made on certain months like yours or friends bdays months to go out or splurge a little extra. You just don't want to feel left out essentially or broke but honestly she is helping you guys save a lot for your goals which is super important. She's not going to them and like look we can't pay our car insurance or buy eggs for our house man we're broke . She's saying hey we have to save our money let's find a cheap way to still have fun. Nothing wrong with that maybe try explaining that to your buddies it's not in any way saying your broke just refusing to take the eye off the goal for your savings", "NAH, I wouldn't say she's projecting an image of you being broke, just saying your not spending. I can't really say if she's being overly cautious or not. %50 of 100 vs %50 of 10000 is a huge difference. Maybe discuss each of you get x amount of fun money or ask her to add money for fun to the budget, since she runs is by you.", "YTA be an adult and budget these things on when she goes over it with you", "NTA. You\u2019re being financially abused. My ex was like this. Desperate to save for a rainy day and refused to enjoy the sunshine. We always couldn\u2019t afford everything while paying 4x the amount we needed to into our mortgage. \nThe point of money is to live.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Again - great to suggest other things from time to time but add some \"entertainment\" into the budget even if it is just going to a bar once a month.", "INFO\n\nAre both making an equal income to the household?", "Just communicate better guys and put \u201cfun\u201d money in the monthly budget, that are transferable to the next one. Nah", "NAH but you are agreeing to the budget. If you want fun money for going out, you need to agree to that as part of your budget. You agree to x amount a month of going out money.", "INFO: Did your wife perhaps grow up poor, living hand-to-mouth?", "The newly converted are always great evangalists.", "Neither one is TA here. Your wife is worried about money and your uncomfortable with how open she is being about it. Both are very very valid. Talk to your wife and see if you can support each other through this.", "NTA but you really should sit down with her and go over the finances and talk about wanting more flexibility to allow for outings with your friends. Perhaps you could suggest to her that instead of always turning down events or wanting to be vocal about being super frugal she could say that the two of your are saving a nest egg to counter inflation costs or some other reason other than seeming practically broke.", "NTA. Is there no such thing as saying any week or outing that \u2018busts\u2019 the weekly hard and fast budget (which sounds unnecessarily rigid in your case but whatever) that it\u2019s taken out of the next week\u2019s?", "NTA\n\nThere is a whole world of difference in having and sticking to a budget and telling everyone you are broke. If you cant go out, then that's all you have to say, you dont need to give out personal information.\n\nYour wife needs to understand that.", " NTA. Money is for spending, you can\u2019t take money to the grave. If my SO puts me in this type of situation, I would be very upset.", "This! \n\nAnd if going out with friends is important, then he should talk about including that in the budget. \n\nI'm also wondering what OP means about the wife only transferring budgeted expenses into their shared account. Is the wife the only one earning the money? If not, couldn't OP set aside some of their own money for entertainment or dining out?", "If he reviews and approves the family budget he can suggest budgeting in entertainment.", "Exactly. Also it doesn't seem like wife was telling people they are broke, but instead that they are trying to save money and that their budget doesn't allow for something, which is not the same thing. I completely agree with wife here, YTA.\n\nSeems you could just add some \"fun money\" to the future budgets.", "They might have some kind of financial goal that\u2019s worth short term sacrifices", "He didn't say he was not enjoying Life. He said they were not Keeping Up Appearances with Friends and not Keeping Up With The Jones.", "I wouldn't say we are not enjoying life. We have a monthly fun budget and we also have nice vacations. It's mostly expensive bars and restaurants we stay away from.\n\nThe alternative programs she usually offers are coming over to our place to play board games or watch a movie, do some free sight seeing, go hiking, to the river, to a viewpoint, to a botanic garden, play pingpong in the park, see a free exhibition, things like that.\n\nI don't have a problem with these alternatives, I'm enjoying them, I'm just uncomfortable with her loudly and proudly telling our friends that we are trying to save money so we don't want to eat out with them, let's do something cheap instead.", "More than 6 months. \n\nWe have a mortgage and a government backed loan. She is worried about the gov loan, because if we don't have a baby within 4 years, it will turn into a really high interest loan that she wants to pay off as soon as the 4 years is up. \n\nSo she is really focusing on saving the money up for it ahead of time. She says that if we do have a baby in 4 years and don't have to pay off the loan, then we will need the money for a bigger flat, so all the more reason to save.", "He's blaming her for a budget he approved. So the mental load and labor required to do the budget is all on her, he approves it, and takes no responsibility. He's TA.", "Is it really shallow to worry about appearing so financially constrained that his friends are asking if he needs help? \n\nI suspect you wouldn't want your friends thinking you need their charity to make ends meet, and you wouldn't think of yourself as shallow for making sure they know that.", "I get your point about OP & his wife not being on the same page; but how does this make OP the AH? His wife is equally at fault for telling their friends about their money woes. Nobody wants others / outsiders to know of their financial situation, unless they specifically want / have to.\n\nAnd being 'shallow for worrying about appearances' is a subjective / opinionated matter; everyone cares about their own / their family's appearances in front of friends, relatives & social circles, it's not right to blame anybody for thinking so.\n\nThough I agree with your suggested course of actions to address OP's problem...", "He reviews and approves the budget. How is it her fault?", "He says the wife takes care of all of their finances. This is also what I do in our family. My husband\u2019s check auto-deposits (as does mine) and I transfer the money to the appropriate accounts.  He does not touch any of the money. This is the way we both prefer it - I\u2019ve offered to give him more control of all of our income but he is happy with this division of responsibility (he takes care of other non-financial things). He does have the passwords for all of our accounts, but he does not do anything with them.  We have conversations about what to do with the money.", "He \u201creviews\u201d it but probably doesn\u2019t even bother to understand it. If he did, he wouldn\u2019t be acting now as if the wife made their budget decisions unilaterally.", "I think that you and your wife need to have a conversation. Maybe the words she uses aren\u2019t quite right and something like \u201cwe are saving money at the moment\u201d or \u201cwe are saving really hard for a house deposit/trip to XYZ/whatever your goal is\u201d. You WOULD be TA if you allow other people to pay for you while you stash half your income however.", "She sounds like a wise and sensible woman", "Surely the easiest and smartest response would just be to explain that they're saving to his friends.", "Yes it is. He could say he doesn't need help, and explain them the situation, rather than agreeing with his wife and then blaming her. There is no shame in saying \"no, we are on a budget but thanks you to worry and care about us\", not blame his wife who does the finances because suddenly he felt ashamed. \nThere is NO SHAME in needing extra help from time to time, it can happen to anyone, so there is no shame when someone asks if you need help. There is no need for op to blame his wife because he thinks that if they needed help it would be a shame. He is especially an asshole because he would rather throw his wife under the bus rather than let his friend believe they might need help. He cares more about his pride than hurting his wife, and that is not a good move.", "> His wife is equally at fault for telling their friends about their money woes. \n\nSaying that something doesn't fit your budget is saying you have money woes.", "Does OP really approve of the budget, or does OP approve it because he\u2019s expected to approve it?\nJust sounds a bit off to me. OP clearly isn\u2019t happy.", "But those are all shared accounts. OP says the wife transfers money into the shared account. I don't think paychecks can get deposited into an account that isn't in your name, can they?", "He's embarrassed his friends think they are having financial problems, not with the budget.", "I\u2019m not sure. Maybe it depends on the bank? I have a certain amount of my paycheck direct deposited into each of our kids\u2019 accounts each month and it did not seem to matter that the account was not in my name - but their account ARE linked to mine.", "Children's accounts are technically shared accounts since an adult has to cosign for it.  I'm also fairly certain that your paycheck gets deposited into your main account and then the bank transfers from that account into theirs. The routing number from those deposits would be from your bank, not the one on your paycheck. For a bank to cash a check, it needs to be signed over to an account holder, and most companies won't issue a paycheck to someone that doesn't work for them because they could be liable for fraud."]}
