It's good that your wife is so responsible and pro-active about managing finances and not wasting money on silly things. It also sounds like she's great at finding alternative options to socialise so your still seeing friends and aren't excluded. I hope you are telling her how much you appreciate all she is doing.\nI can also understand that you don't want to appear broke to your friends and it can feel embarrassing and uncomfortable.\nInstead of saying \"we can't afford to\", maybe you and your wife could tell your friends \"we're focusing on saving money right now\" to prevent misunderstanding. There are a lot of people in this situation at the moment, and I'm sure your friends will understand.", "NAH, I understand both of you.\n\nDoes your budget actually include fun money for each of you privately?\n\nWe pool resources, and pay ourselves a fixed amount of fun money each month, precisely for enjoying life.\n\nI'd suggest making that a fixed part of your budget and putting it into your own, non-shared account.", "A good budget has budget allocated for going out for drinks/food so you should agree on how often/much.\nAlso simply explain to your friends you are on a budget challenge", "NAH, however, discuss and add a line item for entertainment in the budget.  Also, discuss short and long term savings goals, ie., new car, vacations, home and retirement.", "NAH- it\u2019s good your wife is trying to save money. It\u2019s also fine to want to have a little fun, we only are on this earth once. \n\nNext time you are doing the weekly budget, add some for a fun date night. Maybe set some extra aside for therapy for both of you as well so you can communicate better and try to talk to your wife why she is being so paranoid about finances.", "NAH. You should probably get a bit more involved in your family's finances. 50% of your monthly income doesn't say much, depending on what amounts of money you earn and what kind of money you need on a rainy day.\n\nA compromise could be a second shared account, where you put money reserved for fun things you both do with your friends.", "NAH, but only as long as you get yourself involved and help your wife reassess your financial strategy.\n\nI know from firsthand experience that it\u2019s difficult to start feeling comfortable about spending again after going through a tight spot. You are no longer broke but you keep worrying about \u201cwhat if\u201ds, and you don\u2019t know when to stop building up the safety cushion. Well it sounds like you guys can afford to live a little more pleasantly now, so sit with your wife, look over the budget with her and include some fun money in your weekly expenses. It\u2019s perfectly okay if she remains in charge if that\u2019s what works for you guys, but you can\u2019t approve a budget and then blame your wife when you feel embarrassed, it\u2019s not fair.", "NAH\n\nMaybe you are a little too worried about the appearance of your finances, maybe you don't want to worry your friends and family. Maybe your wife should learn to be a little more flexible on the fly, maybe she is only so good at setting goals and reaching them because she knows to stick to her guns.\n\nIt sounds like maybe the most simple solution would be to talk about how you talk, if she can save money without implying to your friends that you *need* money, that would be a win-win, right?", "Your wife is correct, you **reviewed** the family budget and **agreed** to it, now you complain as if she made the budget decisions all by herself. You want the benefit of your wife\u2019s hard work without doing even the bare minimum of paying attention and offering your input **when you were asked.** Instead you blame her after the fact, just because your friend\u2019s question embarrassed you. Yeah, YTA.", "YTA- if you do agree to the budget, then you approve not spending more than what's in your spending account. She does not go telling people that you're broke, she only says you're on a budget which IS true. Since you agreed not to spend more than the 50%, you cannot really go out as much as you'd like. How about, instead of telling her of for stating facts, discuss the budget, change it up, agree to have some \"entertainment allowance\" which you could spend on night outs.", "NTA You\u2019re saving 50% but you\u2019re not enjoying life.

She's right that you are being shallow about her being straightforward about that.\n2. You review the budget.

If you don't like the spending limits, make the effort to give some input.\n\nYour friend asked if you needed help. So what? All you needed to do was tell him 'nah we're good we're just saving hard atm' but instead you complained that your wife is very on top of your finances, which is a good thing for you, and didn't even consider maybe taking some responsibility for said finances instead, as your wife apparently asks you to do weekly.", "YTA - it sounds from your post that you\u2019ve put all the financial stress onto her. Are you fully involved in all of the bills and actually know where you are financially? Are there goals that need to be readjusted? Also if you are just giving final approval on the weekly budget why aren\u2019t you saying hey let\u2019s put aside some extra money for x,y,z? And then having a real conversation about the finances.

If you want to go out with friends, work that into the budget you discuss weekly. Don\u2019t just ok it and then complain you don\u2019t like it.", "NTA. To be worried about \"appearances\" is one thing when it's a keeping-up-with-the-Joneses situation, but another thing when you are genuinely worrying your friends that you're having financial problems. \n\nSurely your wife can understand that she's giving people a false impression that you might be in need of help?\n\nIf she doesn't see that, then you have to be more assertive in setting the weekly budget. She's not wrong in saying you approve her budget every week; so stop doing that.", "Yes, YTA here.  You are accepting her budgetary guidance by default since you probably don't want to be involved in the process or just basically don't save well.  Tell your friends you are just being frugal given the current state of the economy.", "YTA. The two of you are obviously not on the same page, when it comes to savings, but your wife is responsible for finances. And it is shallow to worry about appearances. You don't have to be broke in order to stay away from bars and restaurants. If your priorities are different those of your friend's merely explain this to them.", "NTA. If tou save that much, she can transfer funds when you planned something with friends. Or make an agreement of a weekly 'funbudget' used for little things that can be saved up for bigger outings as a compromise. If you really only have that budget, shes great handling it but you dont.", "Ok, so your wife is obviously extremely stressed and in need, and your reaction is to lecture her for making you look bad? Yeah, no, I don't see the problem here either. \n\nYTA. Help your wife feel better instead of only caring about the effect her stress has on you. FFS, you'd think you loved your wife and like...cared about her wellbeing since you married her. Weird that you don't show it.", "YTA", "Slight YTA because if you haven\u2019t asked how would she know that going out with friends should be included in the budget? Ask her to make a post for that next time and see how she reacts.", "Nah I understand wanting to do things perhaps a bargain could be made on certain months like yours or friends bdays months to go out or splurge a little extra. You just don't want to feel left out essentially or broke but honestly she is helping you guys save a lot for your goals which is super important. She's not going to them and like look we can't pay our car insurance or buy eggs for our house man we're broke . She's saying hey we have to save our money let's find a cheap way to still have fun. Nothing wrong with that maybe try explaining that to your buddies it's not in any way saying your broke just refusing to take the eye off the goal for your savings", "NAH, I wouldn't say she's projecting an image of you being broke, just saying your not spending. I can't really say if she's being overly cautious or not. %50 of 100 vs %50 of 10000 is a huge difference.

His wife is equally at fault for telling their friends about their money woes. Nobody wants others / outsiders to know of their financial situation, unless they specifically want / have to.\n\nAnd being 'shallow for worrying about appearances' is a subjective / opinionated matter; everyone cares about their own / their family's appearances in front of friends, relatives & social circles, it's not right to blame anybody for thinking so.\n\nThough I agree with your suggested course of actions to address OP's problem...", "He reviews and approves the budget.

There is no need for op to blame his wife because he thinks that if they needed help it would be a shame.

Maybe it depends on the bank? I have a certain amount of my paycheck direct deposited into each of our kids\u2019 accounts each month and it did not seem to matter that the account was not in my name - but their account ARE linked to mine.", "Children's accounts are technically shared accounts since an adult has to cosign for it.  I'm also fairly certain that your paycheck gets deposited into your main account and then the bank transfers from that account into theirs. The routing number from those deposits would be from your bank, not the one on your paycheck. For a bank to cash a check, it needs to be signed over to an account holder, and most companies won't issue a paycheck to someone that doesn't work for them because they could be liable for fraud.", "So you're seeing these budgets and are agreeing to them, but are embarrassed because sticking to what you agreed to is causing a misunderstanding with your friend.\n\nWhy not just rework the budget?

Maybe it's just my life experience but my friends and I are open about saying \"I can't afford that right now\". We've always been like that since our late teens early 20s when it was extremely common that we didn't have money. Now that we are more settled we still don't think saying \"let's hang out at home\" is a big deal. \n\nIf the issue is the budget you should do the budget together. Add in money for just hanging out.

It seems like it's more her phrasing not an issue with the budget?", "YTA. \n\nI have to have those conversations with my friends a lot because there is a big discrepancy between our incomes and how much they prioritize saving.

If it\u2019s the first, you need to involve yourself more with the family finances and share some of the responsibility for budgeting. If it\u2019s the second, you are being silly.

I saw zipties at Walmart for $11!!", "All these YTA are missing the ultimate point, which is his wife is projecting financial issues that they don't have, and it's making him uncomfortable. \n\nHis approval of the budget isn't the issue; the issue is HOW his wife is acting when friends invite them out.\n\nESH. Have a talk with your wife, get involved in the budget, save 48% of your income and go out and have fun sometimes.", "Nah. If you have a problem with the budget start being more involved. Tell her you want to add in a section for fun stuff and maybe have the unused roll over to the next weeks.", "NAH, but be careful. Her goals are to be applauded and appreciated.

Tell your friends that you appreciate their willingness to not drop you over this and their offers of help.", "NAH just sounds like a communication issue really. Me and my husband also go through periods of fairly intense saving if we are saving for a specific goal, and similarly will turn down invitations to expensive places for that reason.

It takes 15 minutes per month at this point, and honestly I think that\u2019s an overestimate.", "No, it was the other way around. She grew up comfortably middle class with a nice big house and vacations abroad, never having to worry about money. \n\nShe doesn't seem worried about money, she looks like she is genuinely enjoying counting money and making all her excel tables about projections into the future.", "Yeah, her wording sounds fine, it's the friend who (with good intentions) got the wrong end of the stick. Just tell them you're doing OK but trying to save money.", "Exactly. OP is being lazy and intellectually dishonest.", "Agreed. YTA \nSaying we can't afford something when technically you can is dishonest. Saying something is out of the budget means you have made a decision to spend your money on other things or at least not spend money on that particular thing for whatever reason. There's a BIG difference. \nGrowing up my parents were frugal, but never talked about money. We always thought we were poor, but we weren't. With my kids I try my best to say it's not in the budget right now because we could technically afford whatever it is, but isn't worth spending money on or it's just consuming to consume.", "I mean, to be fair, \"it's not in our budget\" doesn't necessarily mean *we don't have the money* like you and your friends are understanding it. I just means that the money you have is being earmarked for other things. \n\nSo I do think slight YTA. If a friend comes to you concerned, you can just explain, \"oh no we're fine for money, just trying to save more aggressively and avoiding lots of bars/restaurants!\" It doesn't have to be a big thing, and would quickly blow over. \n\nOtoh you could gently ask your wife to use different wording, since it bothers you. To say something like the above -- *oh, we're trying to save more, we're trying to avoid bars and restaurants* instead of the wording she's currently using.

However, lack of frivolous spending has been the bigger factor in financial security. \n\nI spend money, but I really think about it. We were invited to a cousin's wedding. It would have cost about $6k for my family to attend. Airfare, hotel, rental care, food, fancy clothes, etc. If I was going to drop $6k on a trip, did I really want that trip to be to a cousin's wedding in a ho hum city? Nope. I sent them a very lovely gift and, later that year, we went on a vacation that we actually enjoyed. Yes, I still spent the money, but it was on something we really enjoyed. (Actually, I spent a good bit less) The point is to be very thoughtful with your money. Had we gone to the wedding, it would have been very tempting to also go on a vacation that year. \n\nWe don't do big vacations every year. We don't buy new cars every few years. Currently, our newest car is 7 years old. The other one is 12 years old.  We have a nice house, but it's not huge. No designer clothes or expensive handbags. We do enjoy going out to dinner with friends, but we don't go to super fancy places. We definitely keep an eye on how much we spend on that. At times, we have friends over to our house if the dining out budget gets a little excessive.", "Well said!!!", "Omg! I just read it back and now I get it. Sorry. Major duh on my part."]}
