{"id": 27325, "submission_id": "16oecxt", "title": "AITA for making a slow swimming couple feel uncomfortable in the medium lane?", "selftext": "I (33F) recently took up lane swimming at my local pool. When you book to swim, you have to pick a lane, which helps them manage capacity. I always go for medium- I'm not a superstar swimmer by any measure, but I'm there to improve and most of the time I'm matching the speed of others in the lane. I swim during the day and the slow lane often has much older people in it. If someone is swimming faster, it motivates me to push myself harder. I keep track of how long it takes me to swim 1km and I'm trying to improve that time every session. Last time it was 28:18.\n\nThis session especially I wanted to see what my true time was, as I'd done some weightlifting beforehand and wanted to see how that would affect it. \n\nToday I booked my slot for 11am, and when I got there, there was a couple already in the lane. It was pretty quiet today tbh, with only 1 person in the slow and fast lanes, so I can understand why they took that lane. But when I started swimming, I quickly realised they should really be in the slow lane instead. For starters, they weren't strong swimmers- I kept seeing them put their feet down to the bottom of the pool and walk for a bit and they rested regularly at either end of the pool. \n\nAt first I tried pausing to space out our swimming, but I was finding it really frustrating. Moving across to the fast lane was not an option because the guy in there was really hauling ass. Eventually I just started pushing myself, and if the couple were in the way, I would overtake them. Towards the end they were resting more and more at the shallow end and talking and they looked uncomfortable before they left. \n\nHere's why I might be an asshole: at one point, before I said \"fuck it\" and started overtaking them, I was swimming behind the guy at my normal pace and he started walking along the bottom. I end up kinda putting my hands in the air in a \"come on ref!\" style while looking at the lifeguard and imploring her to tell the couple to move lanes. I feel like that was unnecessary. \n\nI also never just clearly said to them \"would you mind moving into the slow lane?\". They were speaking to each other in a non-English language (I think they were Filipino), so there's also a chance that they don't know the swimming culture here. And at the end of the day, it's just swimming, and it's not really fair for me to make someone uncomfortable.

I feel burdensome to others even in the slow lane. But yeah, the middle lane is for confident swimmers and the fast lane is for fast swimmers of a higher standard who do a lot of swimming.

It sounds as if they were mistaken about the lane, possibly due to language issues, which you admit. However, I think frustration was somewhat justifiable on your part and it's not like you did what I've heard of others doing, kicking at people and swimming under them. So it was a reaction but, you know...\n\nThere really should have been a lifeguard there asking the couple to move and so I think the pool management is TA.", "NTA by the rules of your pool... but I've only seen separate swimming lanes with people swimming back and forth in the lanes where people would cross twice per lap...", "In all the sessions I've been there, I've not even been close the fast swimmers.

I loved swimming as a child and did used to wild swim when I lived near a lake, but this is my first time really lane swimming. I thought it was going to be boring, but as long as I keep moving and pushing myself, it's not.", "But you could go in the slow lane, ne?", "Just as a point of info, I didn't reserve it to myself, you just have to book in general at my swimming pool so they have an idea of capacity. You can change lanes though if there's space in other lanes that would fit you better. I often move to the slow lane for 10 cool down laps.\n\nEdit: corrected \"if\" to \"of\"", "or you could have read the whole post before commenting, the fast lane situation was addressed:\n\n>Moving across to the fast lane was not an option because the guy in there was really hauling ass.", "With our pool, the lane is wide enough for people to swim in a clockwise loop. So if you have another person of the same speed in your lane, you'll pass each other halfway going in opposite directions.", "Agree. OP is NTA because they booked the correct Medium lane. Granted, OP could\u2019ve tried to explain the rules to the couple but that\u2019s also not OP\u2019s job or responsibility.\n\nIt also might be a delicate line to tread since what you mean is \u201cyou do not belong in *this Medium lane.*\u201d but it could be misheard and misinterpreted by the couple as \u201cyou do not belong *here, at this gym/pool.*\u201d Speaking only for myself as a pretty bad but motivated swimmer, I\u2019ve been too intimidated to even try lap swimming, even in a slow lane. I\u2019d be too embarrassed I\u2019d eff up the protocol or wreck someone\u2019s workout.\n\nErring on the side of oops not AH, the other couple is also NTA because there may have been a legitimate language barrier to them understanding the rules (for example, maybe they didn\u2019t bring their phones and couldn\u2019t translate the signage without an app), or they may have thought that since there were two of them they would have the lane to themselves (at my pool, it appears to me that people fill in wherever until every lane has two per lane), or they may not be regulars who did not comprehend that OP would be slowing down the Fast lane swimmer if OP moved.\n\nThe lifeguard might be TA for not helping direct the couple to the Slow lane, but then again, maybe that\u2019s not the lifeguard\u2019s responsibility (their primary responsibility being to prevent anyone from drowning).\n\nThe management may be TA for not making the rules clearer to everyone, in this case, the new slow-swim couple. Management could get Google Translate to explain the rules in a different language, or politely redirect the couple. If management had stepped up, it would\u2019ve made the experience better for everyone, I\u2019d imagine.", "I've just swum into them  when  they walking in my swim lane.  After the 3rd time  with one person one day,  I angrily told them to get out and made the lifeguard call the manager.

Honestly it was impressive)\n\nOk....I REALLY want to see this lol!\n\nAs far as the lifeguards responsibilities, I'd say they are responsible for things of this nature as someone could potentially be injured. I used to swim competitively so I know how each stroke is done. Slow swimmers in the medium or fast lanes are dangerous. Especially if someone is working on their backstroke.", "Sorry.  I was projecting.  I have a lot of old people at my pool at 11am.  Doesn't really change my perspective.  It was a simple misunderstanding.", "There is no slow lane at the local pool. Also that would be kind of ableist to expect a disabled person to swim in a separate area. Maybe next time talk to the lifeguard on duty, or whoever works there.", "Yeah, then it would have been nicer to just point out that the lanes have different speeds. You're not TA for wanting them out of the medium lane, just for passive-aggressively initiating conflict instead of just asking. \n\nWhich, incidentally, is exactly what I usually do.", "You should definitely try lap swimming some time! A lot of pools during the day have more than one slow lane because a lot of people swim without speed as a focus.", "At the end of the day, they weren't strong swimmers so it doesn't really matter their age. There are some fantastically strong middle aged swimmers at my pool. Guys in their 50s with cores of steel. And lots of grannies bobbing along.", "But in this instance there was a slow lane.. and it isn't ableist, if you swim slow you go in the slow lane, if you swim fast you go in the fast lane, you can be slow without a disability and you can be fast with one", "Yeah that's why I think I'm the AH.
