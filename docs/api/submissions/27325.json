When you book to swim, you have to pick a lane, which helps them manage capacity. I always go for medium- I'm not a superstar swimmer by any measure, but I'm there to improve and most of the time I'm matching the speed of others in the lane. I swim during the day and the slow lane often has much older people in it. If someone is swimming faster, it motivates me to push myself harder. I keep track of how long it takes me to swim 1km and I'm trying to improve that time every session. Last time it was 28:18.\n\nThis session especially I wanted to see what my true time was, as I'd done some weightlifting beforehand and wanted to see how that would affect it. \n\nToday I booked my slot for 11am, and when I got there, there was a couple already in the lane. It was pretty quiet today tbh, with only 1 person in the slow and fast lanes, so I can understand why they took that lane. But when I started swimming, I quickly realised they should really be in the slow lane instead. For starters, they weren't strong swimmers- I kept seeing them put their feet down to the bottom of the pool and walk for a bit and they rested regularly at either end of the pool. \n\nAt first I tried pausing to space out our swimming, but I was finding it really frustrating. Moving across to the fast lane was not an option because the guy in there was really hauling ass. Eventually I just started pushing myself, and if the couple were in the way, I would overtake them. Towards the end they were resting more and more at the shallow end and talking and they looked uncomfortable before they left. \n\nHere's why I might be an asshole: at one point, before I said \"fuck it\" and started overtaking them, I was swimming behind the guy at my normal pace and he started walking along the bottom. I end up kinda putting my hands in the air in a \"come on ref!\" style while looking at the lifeguard and imploring her to tell the couple to move lanes. I feel like that was unnecessary. \n\nI also never just clearly said to them \"would you mind moving into the slow lane?\". They were speaking to each other in a non-English language (I think they were Filipino), so there's also a chance that they don't know the swimming culture here.

You can change lanes though if there's space in other lanes that would fit you better. I often move to the slow lane for 10 cool down laps.\n\nEdit: corrected \"if\" to \"of\"", "or you could have read the whole post before commenting, the fast lane situation was addressed:\n\n>Moving across to the fast lane was not an option because the guy in there was really hauling ass.", "With our pool, the lane is wide enough for people to swim in a clockwise loop. So if you have another person of the same speed in your lane, you'll pass each other halfway going in opposite directions.", "Agree. OP is NTA because they booked the correct Medium lane. Granted, OP could\u2019ve tried to explain the rules to the couple but that\u2019s also not OP\u2019s job or responsibility.\n\nIt also might be a delicate line to tread since what you mean is \u201cyou do not belong in *this Medium lane.*\u201d but it could be misheard and misinterpreted by the couple as \u201cyou do not belong *here, at this gym/pool.*\u201d Speaking only for myself as a pretty bad but motivated swimmer, I\u2019ve been too intimidated to even try lap swimming, even in a slow lane. I\u2019d be too embarrassed I\u2019d eff up the protocol or wreck someone\u2019s workout.\n\nErring on the side of oops not AH, the other couple is also NTA because there may have been a legitimate language barrier to them understanding the rules (for example, maybe they didn\u2019t bring their phones and couldn\u2019t translate the signage without an app), or they may have thought that since there were two of them they would have the lane to themselves (at my pool, it appears to me that people fill in wherever until every lane has two per lane), or they may not be regulars who did not comprehend that OP would be slowing down the Fast lane swimmer if OP moved.\n\nThe lifeguard might be TA for not helping direct the couple to the Slow lane, but then again, maybe that\u2019s not the lifeguard\u2019s responsibility (their primary responsibility being to prevent anyone from drowning).\n\nThe management may be TA for not making the rules clearer to everyone, in this case, the new slow-swim couple.

I was projecting.  I have a lot of old people at my pool at 11am.  Doesn't really change my perspective.  It was a simple misunderstanding.", "There is no slow lane at the local pool. Also that would be kind of ableist to expect a disabled person to swim in a separate area. Maybe next time talk to the lifeguard on duty, or whoever works there.", "Yeah, then it would have been nicer to just point out that the lanes have different speeds. You're not TA for wanting them out of the medium lane, just for passive-aggressively initiating conflict instead of just asking. \n\nWhich, incidentally, is exactly what I usually do.", "You should definitely try lap swimming some time! A lot of pools during the day have more than one slow lane because a lot of people swim without speed as a focus.", "At the end of the day, they weren't strong swimmers so it doesn't really matter their age. There are some fantastically strong middle aged swimmers at my pool. Guys in their 50s with cores of steel. And lots of grannies bobbing along.", "But in this instance there was a slow lane.. and it isn't ableist, if you swim slow you go in the slow lane, if you swim fast you go in the fast lane, you can be slow without a disability and you can be fast with one", "Yeah that's why I think I'm the AH.

When I used to go swimming I'd go to the fast lane but I know my speed is much faster than most so I'd make it work. Except the one day I go and the fast lanes are full of men in Speedos, swim caps and fancy sport watches. Someone familiar from the fast lane was in the medium lane instead so I joined her and we went to our usual routines. Well I soon got bored of dodging the other two people in that lane who for their ability were in the right place. I started making eye contact with the men in the fast lane and setting off as they did and swimming a length, then I'd watch them swim up to the end, make sure we made eye contact again then I'd zoom off for another length to go pick another victim. I had a great time intimidating multiple men that day but thinking back I was definitely reacting badly", "I think you\u2019re NTA overall but the suggestions you made about, for e.g., talking to them next time and making sure they do understand the different speeds of the lanes, are worth following through if it ever happens again.\n\nUltimately the fact that you\u2019re looking back on the interaction from both sides and trying to evaluate the best call is a good sign that you\u2019re not an ass, you were just frustrated in the moment.", "You definitely should have approached the couple and asked them to move to the slow lane. Please never expect anyone to read your mind and never assume. If you live by those mottos, you will be saved a lot of grief.", "NAH\n\nIt's so annoying when pools want you to pick a lane when you book. I swim 1km in about 23 minutes and sometimes that puts me as the fastest swimmer in the pool and sometimes it puts me in the slowest lane as there are many faster swimmers than me.\n\nThat said, you had to pick and you picked. There's nothing wrong with overtaking the couple of slower people. There's nothing wrong with them staying in the lane they booked. Maybe there's often people much slower than them when they go. If the lifeguards think there's a problem it's up to them to act.\n\nSounds like a lovely quiet pool to be honest.  It'd be much harder with 15 in the lane! Try to just do your own thing and not get annoyed at others doing theirs.", "YTA for overtaking them and then saying at the end \u201cwe\u2019re all here to swim and all paid the same\u201d\u2014next time use your words or speak to a worker at the pool\u2026", "NTA, but I've never heard of lanes being designated as slow, medium, fast. With COVID, the pool I go to now went to a reservation system and limited it to one person per lane, two if they were from the same household. At other pools I've used, you just chose a lane and started circle swimming. If someone happened to be faster, they'd veer into the center to pass. I've certainly shared a lane with at least 3 others in this way. No one ever seemed to have a problem with it.", "Info: Most lap pools have a lines down the middle. Why didn\u2019t you just ask them to split the lane?", "NTA - I\u2019ve been in the exact same situation as you and I was so frustrated.   I think it\u2019s great that people of all abilities want to swim, but everyone need to be respectful of others swimming by placing themself in the appropriate lane.", "You should have just talked to them politely. They probably didn't understand the differences in the lanes yta", "Yup only right answer \nNot your fault", "i get that some people who never do laps may need prompting. the real AHs are people who jump in slow or medium lanes with fins and get upset when they find people in their way", "typically lanes are marked at either end with a little sandwich board for slow, medium, fast, walking or classes. it helps when they have something that says keep left or clockwise only.", "I am a Filipino and if they're first gen they might not now about slow, medium or fast lane. For us, everything is just the pool and tou can use any lane. If you speak to then directly or to the lifeguard that would've been fine. Most of us are non confrontational and when informed that we did something wrong we just say sorry and move. NTA", "Pool etiquette is very variable, and everyone generally thinks the rules at their pool are the norm. It would have been more polite of you to ask them to move, or ask the lifeguard to help resolve the issue. \n\nThey were probably like \"why is this guy being so huffy?\"", "Makes sense.", "Its similar to running. Imagine you are running and someone just stops to walk right in front of you. However you are not able to go around right away.", "I am just like you, the slow lane holds me back these days, but I'm not fast lane material. Resting at the ends is fine but no-one should be walking in the medium lane. I don't like confrontation either so I just overtake. It was only one swim, hopefully they will have learned for next time as other swimmers might not be so non-confrontational. NTA", "For sure.  In my mind I was thinking about cycling, but most cyclists do NOT move to the side, lol.", "I think that if you need to rest, you get out of the pool.  End walls need to be free for flip-turns, it's not safe to block them.", "Exactly this!", "Nta- they were not supposed to be in the medium lane if they are walking in the lane. \n\nOne suggestion (and this is what's I've always done): instead of doing circle swimming, pick a side of the lane. It works out pretty well.", "NTA. I was overseas at a public pool last week and a group of German swimmers arrived. I normally go to the slow lane to not worry about holding others up, but 2 men decided to do breaststroke side-by-side e-x-t-r-e-m-e-l-y slowly in that lane so I moved over to medium (which is actually my pace doing 1km in 23-26 mins).  All good. Until one of the women that group decided not to break up the Bros' completely against the rules side-by-side thing and came over to the medium lane for breaststroke. Look, it's a slow, high calorie burning stroke. I get it, and she was faster than the bro's.  But I do 2:1 backstroke:freestyle and I like pushing myself. Again, lifeguards said nothing. So I lapped her at the ends and passed her twice. I would have said something if I wasn't near the end of my lengths. Super annoying. But the right thing to happen is the lifeguards actually informing visitors of the rules. Except the German bro's. I'm sure they knew better than to take up the *entire* lane just to swim side-by-side and talk between painfully slow breaststroke. jfc. I can't roll my eyes back far enough.", "NTA \nBut I'm curious: where do you live where they make you book a particular lane? Or is it just a thing at this one pool?\nHere,  you just show up and swim.  Some pools have a lane or two closed off for people doing laps but that is mostly used by the ultra fast swimmers", "The couple weren't doing war crimes but if it was someone's fault, yeah, it would be theirs or the lifeguard's. Even without a language barrier they can still see the difference between swimmers' speed in lanes. You did the best you could do in that situation and I can see why it would be annoying - NTA", "I'm a very slow swimmer and when I have to share a lane, I tell the other swimmer \"I'll stay on this side of the lane\" and everything is cool. We don't have slow/medium/fast lanes here. This is my first time hearing of it.", "It's the way it is at my pool, both at the time of booking and when you're at the pool itself they have boards on the side labelling the lanes.", "fwiw, I'm a \"fast swimmer\". Whenever a medium swimmer (someone who can swim continuously without stopping, but who isn't particularly fast) wants to share a lane, we just split instead of doing circle pattern swimming. \n\nIf this scenario ever happens again, I'd encourage you to see if you can catch the fast lane person between sets and ask if you can split right/left, that way no one is overtaking each other. \n\nI'm usually very comfortable \"hugging the wall\", and if you're good at hugging the lane line it's pretty easy.", "Dead beetle. Omg I\u2019m slayed", "That isn't lap etiquette when sharing a lane."]}
