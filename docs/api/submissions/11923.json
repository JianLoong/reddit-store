Unless MIL has heart conditions and in which case she certainly should not be rushing anywhere. Rushing down a flight of stairs is more dangerous than having fun with your wife and child. \n\nHowever, if your mother in law simply said \u201ccan you pre warn me, too\u201d I\u2019m sure it wouldn\u2019t be an issue for you.", "NTA and your MIL needs to get the stick out of her butt.", "This can't be real.

Its not her house so she doesn't get to decide what does or doesn't happen.", "NTA.  Maybe she thought someone was being hurt, but as a general rule don't go to someone's home with kids if you want peace and quiet.  I think your game sounds fun and I like that you check in with your wife first to make sure she is in the mood for the attack.", "NTA\n\nYour MIL sounds a bit much\u2026", "NTA, i get asking you to warn her too next time, but there was no way you could know she would be that startled", "Yes of course your the AH how dare you scare MIL with your wayward and unacceptable behavior.

Is this like a parody?", "NTA but then you that from the last time you posted this", "Well consider it from her POV. She is upstairs and she starts hearing screaming and movement and she has no clue what is going on, that it is just a joke. She rushed down because she thought something was wrong, probably that someone was hurt. NAH I think she was probably a little over the top, but it\u2019s not crazy to be disconcerted by an unexpected thing like that out nowhere.

My mother after years of us begging finally got hearing aids, and what I'm now realising is going deaf isn't just hearing things more quietly it's also distorting the sound. Now she has the hearing aids, she frequently doesn't recognise noises, which means she's been hearing a very distorted version of sounds for several years. \n\nShe heard fireworks for the first time with the hearing aids and thought people were knocking on the windows. \n\nIt's possible all MIL could hear was screams. Still kind of an AH but she may also have been scared.", "NAH, it was probably quite obvious that you were just playing after a bit but your MIL would have got a nasty shock at first. It would have been good to give her a heads-up that this is a thing in your family."]}
