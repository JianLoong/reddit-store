I'm living in a 5-bedroom apartment with 4 other women, we have our own rooms but share living areas/bathrooms. I paid extra for the female-only option. (Not interested in explaining my reasoning for that; it exists, some women are clearly happy to pay for it, there is no issue here.)\n\nOne roommate in particular has been bringing guys into the apartment and lately this one guy (assuming it's her boyfriend) has stayed there multiple nights in a row. I think he goes to the same uni and he finds it convenient to crash here. This has been going on for a few weeks, he will stay a few nights in a row and will constantly be hanging around there during the day. He also uses the shower for over 30 mins when I'm often trying to get ready in the morning, and they will stay up until like 2 or 3am talking loudly and watching shows in the common area on weekdays.\n\nSo the 'conflict' is (and yes mods this is a conflict, not everything is a huge blowup) - I eventually asked her how long he was planning to stay, and I also knocked on the door twice when he was in the bathroom for ages and said hey how long are you gonna be I need to get ready for work. Flatmate didn't seem to see the issue. Now she and the guy are both giving me the cold shoulder.\n\nIf it was one night every once in a while, and he didn't get in the way of things then that would be one thing - but I feel if someone is staying multiple nights/days for an extended period then you have pretty much moved them into the apartment. Further, I feel she's crossed a line because it's a man which means the rest of us have wasted our money on the extra fee and now have to be mindful of what we wear in shared spaces & potentially feel less comfortable. She doesn't seem to see the issue, she is a few years younger and I think it's her first time living away from home. And yes I am prepared to initiate a more serious sit down talk but I wanted to gauge what people think before doing so (hence being on this subreddit).\n\nTL;DR: Flatmate in female-only apartment constantly having male guests for long periods of time (guest not on the lease), I have expressed discomfort but no result", "created_utc": 1699339522, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17poelq/aita_for_not_wanting_flatmate_to_have_her/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd consider reporting this to the school for personal safety sake.", "Info: Since you paid extra for a female only dorm, is is an actual enforced rule that men can't be in the dorm? Is she breaking a rule here?", "NTA - you paid for female only and like you said, a night here or there is fine. Sounds like he's living there...", "NTA. This is on-campus and female-only and I'm guessing there are rules in your lease. Apply them. Report her/him and get this taken care of. It's not your responsibility to accommodate them breaking the rules. You and your flatmates deserve what you paid for. They can stay at his place or anyplace else.\n\nYou've been too accommodating. Even in non-female-only setups, multiple nights in a row is generally breaking the rules, and he shouldn't be getting in the way of people there who pay rent.", "NTA. I'm pretty sure it's safe to say from her attitude toward you that a sit down talk probably wouldn't do much good. I'd report her.", "NTA. I have lived in shared apartments too and for a peaceful living it's important for everyone to agree to and follow the rules they set in place. It's shared but it's your home, you need to be comfortable in your space and that's not negotiable.. you pay for this space. You have paid extra for the female-only option (it's my first time hearing this) so by all means men should no be allowed inside the house. \n\nYou need to report this to who ever it is that has charged you extra for the female-only option. Your roommate needs to respect everyone else living in house. She maybe young and this maybe her 1st time living like this but that's all the more reason for you'll to let her know what's ok and what's not.", "NTA. You pay extra for female only living space and have been unable to use the bathroom as needed because of an extra roommate with no consideration for those who live there who is of a gender you clearly do not feel comfortable living with as you paid extra not to have him there. \n\nIf i were in your shoes I would be respectful but firm about limiting overnight visits to 1-2 nights per month max, with advanced notice of minimum 48 hrs and the understanding that he needs to shower at night, as there have been multiple occasions where you are late or unprepared for work or classes due to his hogging the bathroom in the mornings. Let her know that as you all paid extra for female-only housing this is a more than fair compromise and if she doesn\u2019t abide by it you will have no choice but to report his stays to the university housing authorities as you are  not comfortable living with what has become a male roommate.", "NTA. I\u2019ve been in the same situation (genders reversed) where my roommate was having his girlfriend come to our house and stay for hours while he wasn\u2019t even home. \n\nMy other roommates and I had both run into her while getting out of the shower. It\u2019s caused a ton of tension and eventually made us all go our separate ways. \n\nI\u2019d reach out to you landlord/residence advisor to complain and have him barred from your place.", "This is the reason why I would rather stay in a tent than share a place. It only takes one numbskull to destroy the whole dynamic.  I can only imagine how difficult it must be living in harmony with 4 other people. \n\nNTA and good luck", "NTA. How do your other roommates feel about it? It might be taken more seriously if multiple of you sit the other one down for a conversation about it instead of just a one-on-one. Explain that you have all paid extra for female only boarding, and that you don't mind her bf being there once or twice a week, but he is currently there too often and is taking over spaces that you are all paying for. \n\nTry and work out a compromise and boundaries that work for all of you, such as he can stay over on monday and Tuesday nights, and he's to avoid using the bathroom between 8-10am as that is when those of you paying to live there get ready.", "NTA and don't speak to her again. Just speak to your RA and have them speak to her. She does not sound like the type to listen to anything other than an official reprimand.", "Is it female roommates only or men aren't allowed? If it's the latter, then he shouldn't be there.  If they aren't explicitly breaking any rules,  write it off at part of living with roommates and it'll be over soon. If they are,  turn them in.  \n\nEither way, NTA. Unless they aren't breaking rules and you're still pitching a fit. Lol", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Like is there an agreement in place?", "\r  \nHey there, it's tough when shared living arrangements don't align with everyone's expectations. It seems like your feelings are totally valid. Living in a female-only space, you've specifically chosen this arrangement for your comfort and peace of mind. There's nothing wrong with that. It's a matter of respecting everyone's individual preferences and comfort zones. Maybe it's worth discussing with your roommate how this situation is making you feel, especially regarding the extra fee you've paid and the environment you were expecting. Open communication can often lead to better understanding and finding common ground. Hopefully, your roommate will understand and adjust things a bit. Good luck with your conversation; I hope it all works out for the better!", "NTA. Your reasoning is 100% valid. You paid for a female only apartment, and this guest is behaving discourtesly. Given she\u2019s giving you the cold shoulder now, you might want to consider your options should a more serious chat not result in changes. Is there a housing authority you can talk to?", "If this was an apartment w/out roommate agreements it\u2019d be one thing, but student housing is very different \n\nYou paid for female only, it should be respected \n\nNTA", "NTA, I would be super annoyed. You paid for something that you\u2019re not getting.", "NTA\n\nYour roommate needs to be reported if she doesn't nip this in the bud.\n\nAnd it doesn't sound like she can be reasoned with.", "NTA. I'd report this immediately. If she can't stick to the female only apartment rules, she needs to move to another apartment. You're paying for something you're not getting. That's unacceptable. You already tried to talk with them and they not only refused to abide by the rules, they're now treating you coldly. No way would I put up with that.", "NTA. But don't bother trying to sit her down or \"compromise\" with one or two days a week. Because she has already shown that she doesn't give a crap about how you or any of the other roommates feel about this. Just report her asap. You all paid extra to not have guys in your space, so you shouldn't have guys in your space... period!", "So I used to live in a dorm like this. And while I don\u2019t remember having this as a rule in my contract(might have been and I hadn\u2019t read it properly) there was an implied understanding that we were not to have male guests for long periods of time. We also shared one bathroom among 7 girls and it can get a bit difficult when you\u2019re trying to get ready for uni. I shared a room with a friend(they also had double and single rooms) and the double ones came with a service toilet and kitchenette. We learned to work around each other with shower times and if we had male visitors it would be for a few hours during dinner or, if they rarely spent the night, they would be gone first thing in the morning. It\u2019s just common sense- making you dorm mates lives a living hell makes your life a living hell too.\nEdit to say NTA", "NTA go to the flat administration/dorm administration/landlord who ever is responsible ask whats up", "NTA.\n\nIf she wants to play house with her boyfriend, she can do it at his place. And I\u2019d suggest that she do so.", "I don't think I implied that she was breaking a formal rule here tbh,\n\nMy angle is I feel uncomfortable and feel that this is crossing a line in terms of behaviour.\n\nEdited for phrasing as came off more argumentative than intended!", "I feel like this could backfire and she could get super defensive, seeing as it's multiple people at once. I would personally feel pretty attacked if I had like 3 people bombarding me at once...BUT I do have pretty bad social anxiety.", "I'd pitch a fit too if I paid extra. There's already 5 women living there, it sounds crowded enough already.", "> I don't think I implied that she was breaking a formal rule here tbh \n\nThe fact that you were charged extra for a female only option made me wonder if it was enforced. To me it seems a little strange that they would charge you for that and then have men be allowed to sleep over. That kind of defeats the purpose. I was just asking because I wanted more information about the situation before I gave a judgement, not because I thought you implied it. \n\nEither way I agree with you, you're NTA. Even if it's not an official rule, you all payed to be in a female apartment and she is ruining that by having her bf sleep over so often.", "They're asking for more info to help them determine the answer, not outright trying to be rude to you by insinuating something. You're right, you didn't point out whether there's a rule being broken- which is why this person is requesting that further information. \n\nCommenting \"INFO\" on an AITA post is an official way to request further information. Just thought you'd want to know, since your response seems a bit accusatory and I'm sure that wasn't your intention...", "I definitely misunderstood sorry (I must read slower). The place is run by this big student housing corporation and I'm pretty sure they just want to get a few extra dollars wherever they can with the extra fee, they don't seem too concerned about stuff like noise/comfort as long as people aren't actually moving in without paying rent. But it might be a good idea for me to look through my contract anyway.", "I interpreted the comment as an assumption that a rule must exist in this situation - for me it was confusing because it's a matter of etiquette/behaviour and I wasn't sure how a rule would determine who's the asshole\n\nHowever on reflection, others might disagree with this which is fair enough!", "they definitely have occupancy rules. start there and basically have the corporation enforce your dispute. your roommate may not like it either way, but this way you can sort of wash your hands and avoid the whole back and forth with many people chiming in.\n\n\"sorry, we were told it's against the rules. I wouldn't want to get in trouble either\"", "I was going to comment with the same question, simply because I was going to tell you that knowing whether there's a rule will help you when it comes to getting this dude out of here. You're already NTA because the etiquette has been broken, but there being a rule strengthens your case.", "Whereas it likely wasn't a judgement on you. Otherwise it would have said N T A or Y T A. They were asking so that they could provide you more specific advice. My assumption, anyway."]}
