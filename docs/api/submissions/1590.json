{"id": 1590, "submission_id": "ynawhy", "title": "AITA for being upset that my parents brought me a brand new mattress.", "selftext": "I'm a minor btw.\n\nA week ago, my dad slept on my bed for a day (I was really sick and my mum wanted to keep an eye on me so I slept in their bed and my dad got fed up with how squashed it was) and ever since he has been complaining about how uncomfortable it was. He said it was the worst sleep of his life and he was going to buy me a new, bigger mattress. He was also upset that there was a small period stain underneath the mattress cover (it's not visible unless you take it off).\n\nI've never had any problems sleeping on my mattress, I honestly found it quite comfortable. My dad is quite old and dramatic (he sleeps with about 5 pillows). He is also much taller and wider than me so maybe he didn't fit on the mattress properly.\n\nAnyways, EVERY TIME he has brought it up, I shut it down straight away. I ALWAYS told him that I've found my bed EXTREMELY comfortable and that I LOVE how my room looks. My house is extremely messy and cluttered because of my parents' business and the fact that the hate throwing things away (they've business products everywhere - even my bedroom). I hate it but it's apart of their job so I've never said anything; I'm grateful that it pays the bills, feeds me and keeps me clothed. But, my room was my safe haven. Because of my experience of growing up in a really cluttered house, my room was always really clean and simple. Literally just a bed, desk and my closet. I'm a minimalist so I hate excess/unless things. Everything in my room was white or green (plants). \n\nNow, even when they were buying the mattress I told them NOT TO BUY IT. I told them that a bigger mattress will ruin my room (my room is really small). I thought that was the end of it. \n\nIt's late at night now, I've just came home from a really stressful shift (I was crying on the way home). And, when I open my bedroom I see this UGLY, GINORMOUS MATTRESS WHICH I SAID TIME AND TIME AGAIN I DONT WANT. For reference, my previous mattress was a twin sized bed and now it's a double bed. They also added this tacky patterned wall paper cover thing (previous it just a nice, clean white). They also changed my lovely big white desk which I used to study info this ugly, SMALL (because the bed now takes up so much space relative to my room size) black desk which doesn't even go with my lovely theme. I can't even use this desk (I need my laptop and an excersie book to study) because if how small it is. My old desk chair can't even fit underneath it.\n\nI was crying in my room loudly and I'm pretty sure my dad heard. Honestly, I know it's really spoilt of me (mattresses are extremely expensive and they spent money on me, my dad's actions were out of love) but I genuinely feel extremely upset. Thinking about it makes me cry, I honestly don't even want to go in my room, I want to sleep in the living room or something. AITA? And WIBTA if I slept in my living room tonight instead?\n\nEdit: Thank you for all of the responses! My parents are genuinely really kind and caring people, they've shown me time and time again that they love me unconditionally. They've always supported my needs emotionally. I think they were genuinely concerned with my health and just thought that as my parents they knew best. \n\n I really dislike consumer culture in the sense that I would never throw anything that's working perfectly away, especially knowing it'll add clutter to my room without a purpose. For example, my old laptop was extremely bulky and loud. It started taking longer to load, it slowing became slower, you could hear a piece of the circuit rattling around and in the end it started to impact me academically as it eventually stopped connecting to the Internet. My parents pestered me for months about changing my laptop but I didn't listen until it was too late. I'm just grateful that they had the funds to buy me a new on short notice when I asked them to after it stopped working. Even now, it's just taking up space. This was just the one time, about 2 years old. I was really grateful and I felt heard as they helped me when I needed it.\n\n My parents business is a legitimate business, we're a working class family so we wouldn't have enough money for a storage place and such. The clutter is overwhelming but my house is functional (I can use the kitchen, bathroom etc freely). \n\nMy parents grew up much poorer than me with no formal education so they're really proud of what they've achieved. I think that's why they like spoiling me. \n\nThe new mattress is much more comfortable so I'm guessing it was really expensive. But, my old mattress was genuinely comfortable as well. I've calmed down a bit now. I still really hate my room a lot. I've been burntout with work and school so seeing my room which I truly loved and was really proud of and kept really organised, clean and simple changed in such a big, negative way was really overwhelming which is probably why I had such a visceral reaction. I just felt really unheard and small in the moment.\n\nI honestly wouldn't even know how to approach this topic to my parents without seeming ungrateful. But, I wasn't over exaggerating about the room. The bed is huge, relative to my room size it probably takes up a quarter of my room now. My old desk had a random bathroom cabinet because my parents didn't want to throw it away. My textbooks were also on my desk because there is no space on the book shelf in the hallway. Due to the size of the bed, they've changed my lovely, sturdy white desk into this ugly, flimsy black desk. The bathroom cabinet is now on the side of the desk so my previous desk chair can't even fit underneath the desk so it's just hanging there awkwardly. The glass of the cabinet is so near my feet I'm scared it'll break. My textbooks, medication, bed side lamp and alarm clock now that up so much room that my desk is no longer functional. My parents even removed the folders underneath my desk which stored all my school notes because it would've been impossible for them to fit, I have no idea where they put them. There is a window above my door which impacts my sleep because the bright light from the passage into my room. They've replaced the nice, plain white cover into this tacky green design. There is other things but I'm honestly exhausted.", "created_utc": 1667692788, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ynawhy/aita_for_being_upset_that_my_parents_brought_me_a/", "score": 168, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm sure he meant well, but that really doesn't mean anything when it's actually making you distraught.\n\nI'm not sure why they didn't involve you in getting a new mattress and let you decide together with them about the purchase (except for the fact you only ever just told them not to buy one). \n\nI'm sure there have been plenty of responses about how to confront your parents, but here is my take:\n\nTell them that your desk is too small and that you can't work properly at your desk. Tell them that you do more than just sleep in your room and that the bed/mattress are disproportionate and make it hard to do anything but lay in bed in that room. Tell them you appreciate the gesture and that you like the new mattress, but that it's just too big for your room. It might be a different kind of situation if you had a room where you could just hang out and study separately, but as long as your room has to serve as anything more than just a place to sleep, that mattress is making your room LESS functional.\n\nI would also bring up the topic that you weren't just saying that you found the mattress comfortable to not be a burden, but that you genuinely found it comfortable and didn't NEED a new one. Tell your father that you appreciate that he cares for your sleep, but that you and him have different sleeping habits and that you both need different things to be comfortable. Tell them (and mean it) that you will come forward if you really need anything, and give them a heads up, if you suspect you may soon need anything (like with the laptop, in that scenario you need to tell them that it may stop working soon but you will use it as long as it's functional. Maybe they can get a new one for you earlier, but it'll just be tucked away out of sight if it's really that important to you to keep using things until you literally cannot use them anymore for their intended use).\n\nAnd most importantly, highlight that however well they mean it, their gesture won't necessarily mean much if the result is not a definite improvement in all aspects. It's great you'll sleep better in the mattress, but if studying takes a toll because of it, it's just not worth it, especially if you slept just fine. So in a case like this, where there is a restructure needed to make it work, they need to consult you. You mentioned you are a minor, but you're also having shifts, so I suppose you actually have a job, so you're not a child anymore. You are a person that's taking on work and you're old enough that your parents shouldn't just restructure your personal space without your green light.\n\nThey may enable you to be comfortable and have a roof over your head and provide you with a new laptop on a short notice, but that doesn't mean they get a say over what you need and want (unless you want and \"need\" unnecessary and silly things), but in  this case, they wanted to do something good for you while completely ignoring your wishes.\n\nImagine they wanted you to have a great birthday party and insisted on inviting classmates that you explicitly told them not to invite or cooking food you explicitly told them not to cook. That doesn't really serve any purpose other than making THEM feel better about an image of doing something good for you. But they didn't really do something good for you, at least not exclusively. They meant well, but it was a payoff. It came at the cost of your desk and your room's structure for something that you explicitly mentioned you didn't need that badly. And that's just because your dad didn't sleep well.\n\nI could go on and reiterate, but you get the point: This wasn't an upgrade (which would have been fine), this was a restructure that included an upgrade but also a downgrade in another aspect that they failed to consider. You're not ungrateful for the net benefit to be negative for you. They were inconsiderate and your comfort and your personal space suffered, while your sleeping comfort have been improved.\n\nMaybe some of those points help you to initiate a discussion with your parents. Because you should have that discussion.", "NTA yes your parents tried to do something nice by giving you an upgrade but for you it did not feel like an upgrade. I'm sorry you're going through this but can you move the room around to get more space? Personally I use the Sims to replicate rooms and figure out the best way to set things up to give me the most space so I spend less time throwing furniture around.", "Alright I think I have a solution for you. Ask them to trade it for a twin size and that you'll choose which one you want. That way you can get your other things back in your room and tell them that you want your room back the way it was. The other solution is for them to expand your room that is large enough to fit your big desk, full size bed and a big bookcase. Also maybe they can have a workshop for their business and keep the business products in there.", "I was gonna say YTA till I actually read the story. Your room is your sanctuary, your private space, where you can do what you like. I can imagine how pissed you are. They are trying to make it more about them. If they haven't thrown the old one out yet, go find it and take it back to your room where it belongs. Tell your parents that you don't mean to sound ungrateful, but you didn't feel the need to buy a new mattress, therefore you don't want one, therefore if they want it they can put it on their bed.\n\nETA, I forgot to leave my judgement, though it should have been obvious to anyone except the bot: NTA.", "Apparently the bed takes up 1/4 of the room, which really doesn\u2019t seem like much", "The problem is that OP works at that desk. That room is not just a room where they sleep, it's one where they work/study in on top. Working on a desk that is too small is cumbersome and it sucks and there are solutions that involve a new mattress without having to downgrade the desk.\n\nGood intentions and all, but the size of the mattress seems to be enough for OP, so they could have gotten the same size. It was overall a bad decision because A) it's important that OP gets a mattress that works for them. Some like/need a softer mattress, some sleep best on a firm one. Considering that it seems to have been a rather expensive one, NOT including OP in the selection process was stupid to begin with.\n\nThere are other solutions that could have worked for OP, but those haven't been considered and it came at a detriment of OP's overall comfort, and that is with OP being against a change from the get go.", "Yes i get all that but given that it is not possible to go back in time and undo what has been done i was trying to provide suggestions that might stand a chance of getting the room back the way it was or at least closer to the way it was.  I suspect the father may think he was doing what was best for her even though clearly it was not.  Acknowledging the good intention (however wrong it was) might be more likely to persuade him to correct rather than attacking him would.", "For real my mother had what we can only assume was some sort of sundowners syndrome when we were children and there were mountains of rotting food and dirty dishes everywhere, CPS was called pretty much by any teacher that had to drive us home because she didn't show up go get us from school and nothing ever came of it."]}
