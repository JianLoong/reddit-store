{"id": 31451, "submission_id": "180vjr9", "title": "AITA for not reimbursing my friend for an ingredient I used for dinner?", "selftext": "So the gist of things is that I (m28), have a friend (f32) who I meet up with around once a week for dinner. This will usually be at my home, since she doesn\u2019t have much space at hers, and because I will be the one cooking. I love cooking, have been doing it since I was 6, and I\u2019ll usually prepare us dinner with a mix of pantry staples and a few things I\u2019ll add into my weekly grocery shop.  It\u2019s a nice little break in the week, and we both really enjoy it.\n\nThe issue arose when my friend contacted me and told me they would have other friends visiting from abroad on the day we were set to have dinner. She wanted to hang out with them, but also wanted to make our dinner. I suggested if they were open to the idea, they could come with her and I would cook for all four of us. She spoke to them, and they agreed.\n\nOn the day of, I asked my friend if they had any requests. She asked for a local dish that comes with a steak topping (baked Japanese curry rice with steak if anyone is curious), and I said that would be fine, I would get the cheese if the three of them could get the steak they wanted for themselves. I myself am vegetarian, but I don\u2019t mind cooking meat for guests. She agrees. I also give her some suggestions for what she can ask for in Japanese to get a good, mid-priced cut of steak.\n\nWhen they arrive, I\u2019m already doing my prep. My friend hands me the steak, and I notice it\u2019s a very high quality one - practically coated in marbling. I mention how surprised I am, and she laughs it off saying that the assistant she spoke to recommended it as a very good cut. I carry on cooking.\n\nWe end up having a great dinner, everyone was very complimentary about the food and I opened some wine I\u2019d bought for the dinner too. We ended up chatting until quite late before everyone left. Things got a little awkward after they left.\n\nI received a text from my friend saying they\u2019d all enjoyed the dinner, and asking me to transfer her around 9500\u5186 ($64) for the steaks. I refused, pointing out that I hadn\u2019t eaten any, and that I\u2019d paid for everything else. She then said that I should have told her I wouldn\u2019t be willing to include the steaks in the dinner and prepared something else, and she wouldn\u2019t have bought them as her finances were tight at the moment.\n\nTo me, this doesn\u2019t really hold water. Firstly because she\u2019s aware I\u2019m a vegetarian and wouldn\u2019t include steaks unless asked, but more so because she specifically bought a more expensive cut of steak that my recommendation, which feels very presumptive if she truly believed I was paying for it.\n\nHowever, responses from her and some of our friends have been mixed. Some support me, whereas others highlight that she\u2019s been struggling financially, and that it\u2019s unfair to spring a charge on her now after I covered the cost for all of our previous dinners, making her expectations reasonable. A few have also cited the maxim of \u201cthe person who extends the invitation pays\u201d which I\u2019m not very familiar with, but is apparently a thing?\n\nSo, AITA for not paying this back?", "created_utc": 1700611238, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/180vjr9/aita_for_not_reimbursing_my_friend_for_an/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What the hell is even going on here\n\nDo you usually pay for the meals entirely? Even if you do I'm not saying that suggests you should pay her back, it would just piss me off more.

You dont pay for guests when you potluck. NTA.", "NTA. You specifically asked them to get the steak they wanted to eat. Why would you be paying for their groceries? You aren't charging them for your time and effort cooking.

Violating that would be like you presenting them with a check for all the ingredients for every meal you've prepared for them.\n\nHer comment that she wouldn't have bought such expensive meat being short on funds is also kind of telling.

While if you invite people to dinner in your home, it is assumed you buy the ingredients and not charge the guests, if a guest says \"please cook me X with the YZ and I'll bring the X,\" you would not need to pay for the X as you prepared the X as well as providing the YZ.", "NTA\n\nIf you didn't agree to pay for steaks, you don't have to pay for steaks.

And if it comes up again in the future, be sure to be clearer with each other in advance.", "NTA- You cooked for her friends from abroad? And she wants reimbursement?", "NTA at all. It\u2019s rude that she asked for steak knowing you\u2019re a vegetarian; got very expensive steak and wants you to pay. I guess you need to stop paying for the weekly dinners as she\u2019s acting entitled and spoiled. If her finances were so tight she had no business requesting an expensive dinner. Continue to stick up for yourself and stop worrying about what others say.", "NTA- You don't eat meat, you didn't pick out the meat. This is different if you all talked about it beforehand. You did nothing wrong, your friend should be an adult and not make these plans if they are struggling financially.", "I don\u2019t normally ask her to pay for anything because they\u2019re usually simple dinners made with things I already have in the kitchen, plus maybe a couple dollars worth of vegetables. It very much seemed like a non-issue before this.", "You should probably take a class in reading comprehension, then, because it's very clear from the information presented that the OP cooked the steak and the friend and her friends ate it.", "Maybe you need to read it a 4th time. She and her friends wanted steaks, he didn't ask them. He cooked the steaks for her and her friends to eat. He's a vegetarian, didn't eat the steaks. He recommended a cheaper cut steak and she brought a higher price one. He's clearly NTA.", "OP fixed them. OP cooked a meal and used the steaks.", "OP did not go to a restaurant.

He prepared the rest of the food at his cost", "Did you actually read the post?

In what universe does OP owe someone money for an ingredient they know he wont eat that he told them to get themselves? lol", "Did you even read the post? OP is cooking, for free, at their house. They even agree to cook steak while they personally are a vegetarian. They normally pay for everything. Their guest picked up a very expensive steak for OP to cook, and expected reimbursement for that.", "That's what I've been doing wrong if I take food somewhere, I haven't given the host a bill!!\n\nBoggles my mind that people would think that, if host was like \"can you also grab me -item- while you're there?\" I could understand expecting that item to be paid for, but if someone had regularly been feeding me for however long, I wouldn't ask for it back even if I'm struggling.\nI'm still ahead financially ahead if I were to add up how much I think I would have spent on food each meal they've paid for compared to what the bonus item I grabbed was.", "It would be a nice gesture for OP to pay if the friend had gotten the mid-priced steak as OP recommended and it was indeed a miscommunication.

SHE took it upon herself to take the bait on the more expensive meat that the butcher offered her. \n\nTo you that means that OP should pay?? Cause to me that means either ol girl was trying to impress her friends and got what she wanted not what was suggested, or she\u2019s an idiot who can\u2019t think far enough ahead to realize that just cause the butcher says the more expensive cut was better doesn\u2019t mean it was the best idea for her financially.", "You need to start matching effort with people. Your relationship with her is based on that fact that you constantly give and she takes. Do not pay her, but do not cook for ever again.", "I\u2019m sorry to say this, but she\u2019s taking advantage of you. You cook for her weekly, while she never reciprocates. Then she brings over an additional two people, creating more work and a higher cost for you. And when you asked her to pick up something you don\u2019t even eat, she bought a much more expensive item that you recommended and expected you to reimburse her even though you always pay for everything. \n\nYou are so NTA and you deserve a better friend."]}
