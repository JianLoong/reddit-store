This will usually be at my home, since she doesn\u2019t have much space at hers, and because I will be the one cooking. I love cooking, have been doing it since I was 6, and I\u2019ll usually prepare us dinner with a mix of pantry staples and a few things I\u2019ll add into my weekly grocery shop.  It\u2019s a nice little break in the week, and we both really enjoy it.\n\nThe issue arose when my friend contacted me and told me they would have other friends visiting from abroad on the day we were set to have dinner. She wanted to hang out with them, but also wanted to make our dinner. I suggested if they were open to the idea, they could come with her and I would cook for all four of us. She spoke to them, and they agreed.\n\nOn the day of, I asked my friend if they had any requests. She asked for a local dish that comes with a steak topping (baked Japanese curry rice with steak if anyone is curious), and I said that would be fine, I would get the cheese if the three of them could get the steak they wanted for themselves. I myself am vegetarian, but I don\u2019t mind cooking meat for guests. She agrees. I also give her some suggestions for what she can ask for in Japanese to get a good, mid-priced cut of steak.\n\nWhen they arrive, I\u2019m already doing my prep. My friend hands me the steak, and I notice it\u2019s a very high quality one - practically coated in marbling. I mention how surprised I am, and she laughs it off saying that the assistant she spoke to recommended it as a very good cut. I carry on cooking.\n\nWe end up having a great dinner, everyone was very complimentary about the food and I opened some wine I\u2019d bought for the dinner too. We ended up chatting until quite late before everyone left. Things got a little awkward after they left.\n\nI received a text from my friend saying they\u2019d all enjoyed the dinner, and asking me to transfer her around 9500\u5186 ($64) for the steaks. I refused, pointing out that I hadn\u2019t eaten any, and that I\u2019d paid for everything else. She then said that I should have told her I wouldn\u2019t be willing to include the steaks in the dinner and prepared something else, and she wouldn\u2019t have bought them as her finances were tight at the moment.\n\nTo me, this doesn\u2019t really hold water. Firstly because she\u2019s aware I\u2019m a vegetarian and wouldn\u2019t include steaks unless asked, but more so because she specifically bought a more expensive cut of steak that my recommendation, which feels very presumptive if she truly believed I was paying for it.\n\nHowever, responses from her and some of our friends have been mixed. Some support me, whereas others highlight that she\u2019s been struggling financially, and that it\u2019s unfair to spring a charge on her now after I covered the cost for all of our previous dinners, making her expectations reasonable.

She was probably embarrassed to have made the mistake particularly because you had given her the guide to exactly what you recommended in her price range and she'd not utilized it properly.

The 'friend' set you up to cook for her friends but telling you that she wanted to spend time with them AND enjoy your dinner.\n2. The 'friend' agreed to buy the meat that she was requesting you cook for just her and her friends. She took it upon herself to pick out a really expensive cut of meat.\n3.
