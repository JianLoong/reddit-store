My brother and his wife had their baby girl recently. The sex was kept a secret until the baby was born. On the day of, my brother sent us a teaser picture of the baby right before we met her in person. You couldn\u2019t make out the sex of the baby because the picture was only of her face and my brother was holding off surprising us within the hour once we met the baby in person. \n\nWell, the picture of the baby captured the name tag of one of the delivery nurses. I then shared the baby\u2019s picture within a cousin\u2019s group chat and we proceeded to guess the baby\u2019s sex based only on its facial features. A bit later my cousin started referring to the baby as a girl. Upon being asked \u201cIt\u2019s a girl?!\u201d by another, I replied \u201cNo. We don\u2019t know yet.\u201d, then my cousin answered, \u201cYes for sure! (Baby\u2019s name)! That RN is my friend. She told me.\u201d When that text came through my mom, my wife and I were looking at my phone. My cousin ruined the surprise for us, my brother\u2019s most immediate family. We had been anticipating the sex reveal for the better part of 8 months and this is the first grandbaby in the family. My cousin had to recognize the nurse\u2019s name tag, reach out to her for the info, and then came back into our group chat to ruin the surprise. I don\u2019t understand why she would go through all the effort to find out the baby\u2019s sex before immediate family and take it upon herself to announce the sex. My family has been deliberating about placing a complaint against the nurse for sharing personal information. Although, my cousin tried to backtrack and say she was just kidding, she spelled the baby\u2019s name correctly (untraditional spelling). I also don\u2019t think she would come up with such a bad thorough joke.\n\nRecently, we have been focusing on the baby and haven\u2019t placed a complaint yet nor really called my cousin out for what she did. We continue to be bothered by it though. The worst part is that, if the same was done to her and her family, it would be a HUGE problem.\n\nHow is the nurse just allowed to share such information? How does the nurse know that she isn\u2019t putting the baby in danger?\n\nWould I be the asshole to call my cousin out and place a complaint on the nurse? Or, is my cousin and her nurse friend the asshole?", "created_utc": 1680319370, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1289o1n/wibta_for_reporting_a_delivery_nurse_for_a/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, consider the following possibility: your cousin reached out to her nurse friend.

As soon as your cousin started discussong a patient, the nurse should have said she can't discuss the delivery, etc. She's not even allowed to confirm the mom was a patient or not.\n\nI would report it, being as detailed as possible so the recipient gets the whole story. If nothing else, it needs to be done to shut off your cousin's gossip supply, because the cousin won't do it willingly, and letting it go means the nurse will never know she can't trust your cousin.", "YWBTA- for reporting the nurse and I will explain below \n\nYou should call out your cousin for sure, that was an absolute jerk move. Reporting the nurse should be up to your brother and SIL, not you or anyone else. \n\nWhile you are correct the nurse shouldn\u2019t have shared the information, we don\u2019t know the circumstances the information was shared. If they\u2019re good friends who knows what your cousin said to get the information.

After he was born, the nurse who was fresh out of nursing school, went out into the waiting room and announced that he is a boy to my family waiting. The head charge nurse came in explained the situation and apologized. Luckily for the nurse, I was in such bliss holding my new born, that we felt it wasn\u2019t worth getting upset at the nurse who \u201cspilled the beans\u201d, she already felt bad, learned a lesson, and we didn\u2019t want to tarnish our happy moment. I would\u2019ve personally been upset had one of my family members reported the new nurse, as we forgave her and let it go.", "Sounds like your cousin is more to blame. How do you even know what the actual conversation was between the nurse and your cousin? It's up to the patient to report it if they are concerned their rights were violated.

Now if she had said \u201cyes she\u2019s cute and let me tell you what they are testing her for\u201d\u2026that would be a hipaa violation.

In what world is random extended family knowing a child's gender a bit sooner than they wanted to know now child endangerment?\n\nIf the RN called a stranger and offered up the baby's geotag and social security number ok this is a problem, but responding to a family member who asked a question your cousin should not have asked, that's a fumble, not the drama you are suggesting.

She needs to be reported for what she did and your cousin needs to understand she is the sole reason the complaint is being placed. If it wasn't for her then non of you would be going through this.", "Technically it\u2019s a HIPAA violation to even acknowledge you saw a patient at the hospital unless you have permission to disclose the information from the patient. And in the case of minors, the minor\u2019s parent(s). It takes 2 seconds to ask the parents if you can share information with a specific person. I am not sure if it warrants a report, since that can lead to harsh consequences, but it is considered a violation.", "While I agree to an extent, that nurse friend missed a lot of red flags. 1. Obviously cousin knows the baby has been born and has seen a photo, because cousin recognized the nurse\u2019s name tag in said photo. 2. If cousin had to actually ask for name and gender, she obviously didn\u2019t know, and nurse should have figured there was a reason behind that. 3. If it\u2019s untraditional spelling, nurse friend probably had to check the chart to ensure she spelled it correctly before providing info to cousin. \nThis may be a mild-violation, but this is more than poor judgment on the nurse\u2019s part. What if cousin had been recently estranged? What if parents had a special announcement planned?", "Hey bestie. I\u2019m so excited you got to help deliver my cousin\u2019s baby. Baby is adorable. \nNurse: yes she is. Glad I could help. \n(Saying a baby is cute isn\u2019t sharing information and it\u2019s perfectly normal to use a person\u2019s gender when speaking of them.)", "No. This would be at best a minor ding against her license, probably some mandatory extra training on patient privacy. \n\nNo way this would end her career.", "You worded it perfectly! It was glaringly obvious that the family is retaliating against the person that\u2019s easier to blame, rather than their family member. They need to be honest with themselves.", "Doesn't matter how the convo went.\n\nStrike one: acknowledging that she saw the patients \n\nStrike two: providing the baby's name.", "Maybe it helps to shut this nurse up in future cases? What if information is spilled on a family with protection order against someone else?", "It is. The nurse friend isn't allowed to acknowledge that she saw a patient without permission from said patient and since we're talking about a newborn, the parents in this case.\n\nAlso the whole sharing the baby's name part", "Nurse also used the name of the baby. What if this information (baby born, name) was forwarded to a family member / another person with a protection order? This nurse needs to learn to shut up. It is not her information to share about her patients.", "The nurse shared information of a minor patient without parental permission. The parents are the ones you should be deciding if they want to do a report or not. It was their information leaked.", "The answer is in the question\u2026 \u201cHow does the nurse KNOW she ISN\u2019T putting the baby in danger?\u201d\u2026. the nurse doesn\u2019t know\u2026 she doesn\u2019t know me, my brother, or any of my immediate family. Sooo how does she know my cousin is truly my cousin? Obviously, the baby isn\u2019t in danger in this situation but she could\u2019ve been in a difference situation. So what? The nurse gets away with this and may, in the future, share more sensitive information? At the very least the person inquiring (my cousin or not) knows sex, DOB, hospital of birth, and first name\u2026.", "Yeah this is definitely a HIPAA violation and a violation of your privacy. And I second the part where it was mentioned that even telling someone you were in the hospital is dicey. I know I can\u2019t even acknowledge that someone is seeing me for therapy without signed consent. This would come up when family called to \u201ccheck\u201d on people I worked with.\n\nI say NTA. HIPAA violation and your cousin disrespecting your wishes is not okay. It\u2019s up to you on whether to report but a conversation with the nurse and cousin if you\u2019re up to it might be a good way to go.", "Yea, I 100% agree it's a HIPAA violation! To clarify, by \"potentially mild\", I meant that it ranges from mild to severe, not from non-violation to mild.", "There have been times in my life where I shoulda got in trouble for things. But I didn\u2019t. I find it hard to report the nurse, personally.\n\nAlthough I would try to yell at her for this and let it be punishment enough most likely.", "I agree it's a lapse in judgement, and that the situation could've been a lot worse. My most generous interpretation would be that the cousin effectively engaged in a social engineering attack and the nurse fell for it.", "The thing is, she even give them the name of the baby. When my son was admitted in the NICU, they wouldn\u2019t let my mother see him without a wrist band with his name on it and confirming she was grandma. They aren\u2019t allowed to even give away names of the babies they deliver and to even have that leak to cousin means she asked. What if cousin was some psycho who wanted to steal the baby as soon as they were out of the hospital? I\u2019ve seen enough murder channel to see sisters steal their sister\u2019s baby. There is a reason they aren\u2019t allowed to leak anything without parents permission. You even have to have a code word and the code word changes every other day if you call to ask about the baby through the hospital.", "Nope, when I see someone who may know my patient, I am not even allowed to acknowledge they were my patient. We can get in a lot of trouble as HIPPA covers any and all patient information.", "     No, you\u2019re wrong, it would be easier for me to \u201cretaliate\u201d against my cousin and not the nurse.\n     I just can\u2019t help to feel that the nurse was so lax with handing out this information\u2026 what else has she or will she be sharing throughout her career?\n     Regardless, this is why I posed the question to AITA and appreciate the feedback.", "It does matter because the post isn't from the cousin so we don't know about the conversation at all. You don't know that any of those stikes happened.", "Agreed. It is a HIPAA violation. I can\u2019t even acknowledge someone is seeing me for therapy without consent.", "I doubt the nurse thought she was revealing anything given that the reason why your cousin knew who to contact was a photo you shared. As others pointed out, your cousin could have said \u201coh, the baby is really cute,\u201d nurse \u201cyes, she is.\u201d \n\nWhen a family member calls, I just go to the room and say \u201cso and so is on the phone, they want an update \u201c and often hand over the phone to a pt who is embarrassed a family member bugged their busy nurse because they didn\u2019t answer the phone. \n\nYou seem to assume a lot of ill intent on the part of the nurse and I think that\u2019s unlikely to be the case. I think whether to file a complaint should be up to the patient, not you.", "And once a HIPAA provider, always a HIPPA provider. I would expect a nurse received training on that."]}
