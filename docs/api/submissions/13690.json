My brother and his wife had their baby girl recently. The sex was kept a secret until the baby was born. On the day of, my brother sent us a teaser picture of the baby right before we met her in person. You couldn\u2019t make out the sex of the baby because the picture was only of her face and my brother was holding off surprising us within the hour once we met the baby in person. \n\nWell, the picture of the baby captured the name tag of one of the delivery nurses. I then shared the baby\u2019s picture within a cousin\u2019s group chat and we proceeded to guess the baby\u2019s sex based only on its facial features. A bit later my cousin started referring to the baby as a girl. Upon being asked \u201cIt\u2019s a girl?!\u201d by another, I replied \u201cNo. We don\u2019t know yet.\u201d, then my cousin answered, \u201cYes for sure! (Baby\u2019s name)! That RN is my friend. She told me.\u201d When that text came through my mom, my wife and I were looking at my phone. My cousin ruined the surprise for us, my brother\u2019s most immediate family. We had been anticipating the sex reveal for the better part of 8 months and this is the first grandbaby in the family. My cousin had to recognize the nurse\u2019s name tag, reach out to her for the info, and then came back into our group chat to ruin the surprise. I don\u2019t understand why she would go through all the effort to find out the baby\u2019s sex before immediate family and take it upon herself to announce the sex. My family has been deliberating about placing a complaint against the nurse for sharing personal information. Although, my cousin tried to backtrack and say she was just kidding, she spelled the baby\u2019s name correctly (untraditional spelling). I also don\u2019t think she would come up with such a bad thorough joke.\n\nRecently, we have been focusing on the baby and haven\u2019t placed a complaint yet nor really called my cousin out for what she did. We continue to be bothered by it though. The worst part is that, if the same was done to her and her family, it would be a HUGE problem.\n\nHow is the nurse just allowed to share such information? How does the nurse know that she isn\u2019t putting the baby in danger?\n\nWould I be the asshole to call my cousin out and place a complaint on the nurse? Or, is my cousin and her nurse friend the asshole?\n\nEDIT: Hi everyone, a lot of y\u2019all feel like it\u2019s not up to me to report the nurse and only up to the parents. (More aggressively that I should mind my business.) IF there is suspicion that a nurse has violated HIPAA, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you are or are not directly involved, they still may have violated HIPAA and you can report them. \nShould I not be allowed to report a break in at my neighbor\u2019s house, while they aren\u2019t there, since it isn\u2019t my house?", "created_utc": 1680319370, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1289o1n/wibta_for_reporting_a_delivery_nurse_for_a/", "score": 326, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She needs to be reported for what she did and your cousin needs to understand she is the sole reason the complaint is being placed. If it wasn't for her then non of you would be going through this.", "Technically it\u2019s a HIPAA violation to even acknowledge you saw a patient at the hospital unless you have permission to disclose the information from the patient. And in the case of minors, the minor\u2019s parent(s). It takes 2 seconds to ask the parents if you can share information with a specific person. I am not sure if it warrants a report, since that can lead to harsh consequences, but it is considered a violation.", "While I agree to an extent, that nurse friend missed a lot of red flags. 1. Obviously cousin knows the baby has been born and has seen a photo, because cousin recognized the nurse\u2019s name tag in said photo. 2. If cousin had to actually ask for name and gender, she obviously didn\u2019t know, and nurse should have figured there was a reason behind that. 3. If it\u2019s untraditional spelling, nurse friend probably had to check the chart to ensure she spelled it correctly before providing info to cousin. \nThis may be a mild-violation, but this is more than poor judgment on the nurse\u2019s part.

It was glaringly obvious that the family is retaliating against the person that\u2019s easier to blame, rather than their family member. They need to be honest with themselves.", "Doesn't matter how the convo went.\n\nStrike one: acknowledging that she saw the patients \n\nStrike two: providing the baby's name.", "Maybe it helps to shut this nurse up in future cases? What if information is spilled on a family with protection order against someone else?", "It is.

What if this information (baby born, name) was forwarded to a family member / another person with a protection order? This nurse needs to learn to shut up. It is not her information to share about her patients.", "The nurse shared information of a minor patient without parental permission.

When my son was admitted in the NICU, they wouldn\u2019t let my mother see him without a wrist band with his name on it and confirming she was grandma. They aren\u2019t allowed to even give away names of the babies they deliver and to even have that leak to cousin means she asked. What if cousin was some psycho who wanted to steal the baby as soon as they were out of the hospital? I\u2019ve seen enough murder channel to see sisters steal their sister\u2019s baby.

You don't know that any of those stikes happened.", "Agreed. It is a HIPAA violation. I can\u2019t even acknowledge someone is seeing me for therapy without consent.", "I doubt the nurse thought she was revealing anything given that the reason why your cousin knew who to contact was a photo you shared.

She violated the agreement and should be reported. Yes she told it to a friend and not a stranger, but that isn't relevant. The fact that she told someone medical information who should never have access to that information, is a major red flag. Besides, people saying that the nurse didn't know the parents didn't want to share so she didn't fuck up are completly wrong. It is never the nurse's position to inform anyone except the parents about medical information regarding a baby, there are obvious exceptions ofcourse.\n This is a perfect example of \"it it starts here, where does it end\".", "Hard to say honestly! I'd talk to your cousin before you make the complaint... I question how many people she's leaked info to in the past if this was able to happen so quickly, when you waited so long to reveal. I get why your upset and seems like you cousin wanted to seem like she knew before everybody... (Super weird way to get attention). You're definitely NTA but you need more info on why and how etc. Wish ya the best on the newborn.", "I\u2019m genuinely curious, does the fact that the parents posted a picture of their baby that included the nurse\u2019s name in any way mitigate a potential HIPPA claim against the nurse? Regardless, I think OP\u2019s problem should be more with the cousin for ruining the surprise, rather than the nurse for revealing the name of the baby, especially since we don\u2019t know the exact context of that. For example, if the cousin told her friend, the nurse \u201cmy cousin posted a picture of you holding his baby at the hospital. Isn\u2019t that such a coincidence that you were their delivery nurse?\u201d \u201cOh yeah, little baby x is so cute\u201d.
