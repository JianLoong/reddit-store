Send her a bunch of daisies as a passive aggressive apology.", "NTA I have a dog Oliver. My cousin had a son and named him Oliver. She didn\u2019t name her son after my dog. (My dog is 8 years older) She liked the name and so do I hence why we both chose it. She never once suggested I change the name of my dog because it\u2019s her sons name. I never asked her to change her sons name because it\u2019s my dogs name. I just said \u201coh great name\u201d when I heard she was naming her son that.", "\u201cShe said the name was for people, not dogs\u201d Well, guess what, the daisies called and want their name back. They think the name is for flowers not people.", "NTA, tell them you've changed your dogs name to your cousins name, then ignore them till the next big gathering. There's every chance Daisy won't even be with your cousin by then lol", "YTA. For joking about it. You can name your dog whatever you want.  But jokingly saying\" you and my dog share the same name\" can be taken as comparing them with a dog and could be taken as insulting by some people. Especially when you never met them before.  They don't know you or your humour and could come off as offensive. And you have to respect that. \n\nYou definitely don't have to change your dog's name. But I can understand why he asked you to. Maybe she didn't want to be confused with a dog in your family. But I feel you do owe her an apology for comparing her to a dog since she didn't like it and you made her feel uncomfortable.", "NTA for not changing her name, but really, what were you thinking? \n\nDaisy is obviously a cow\u2019s name. Buttercup and Daisy.", "NTA. The real A-H'S here are the folks demanding you change your dog's name for somebody else. The amount of stories I've read recently about this is nuts - you're allowed to share your name with a pet. \n\nTell human Daisy to grow up and give puppy Daisy some belly rubs. They're never going to be in the same room, so the fact that she's making it a big deal says a lot about her. Your cousin is in for a ride.", "They're being stupid. I literally named one of my human children the name of a cat I had as a child. I loved that cat.", "Nta, deffinately over reacting on their part. \n\nI always imagine daisy as a name for a cow wearing a sunhat. Better not say that to your cousins overly sensitive girlfriend tho.", "Actually that name is for cows not people. NTA", "NTA\n\nDaisy can't be a dog name? You can let them know that this internet strangers first dog was also named Daisy, 25 years ago.", "NTA, obviously.

Sometimes people and animy have the same name as you", "NTA cousin's GF is psychotic to be upset by this. I had a dog named Daisy as a child and it is literally listed as one of the most popular female dog names. Later I had a foster daughter named Daisy that came into my life as a baby.

Less common for a human. Don't change your dog's name for these entitled aholes. Completely NTA.", "NTA. Lol! \nI have a friend who is a \"Roxy\". She has a neighbour and friend who both have dogs called Roxy. When the owners say things like \"Roxy, come.

They're being ridiculous.", "Idk why people get so bent out of shape. I was (accidentally) named after my neighbours German Shepherd dog and it effects me not at all. \n\nFor those wondering it was my uncle who was visiting when I was born that had suggested my name and my parents liked it and went with it. My uncle didn\u2019t let on he had heard the neighbour yelling at his dog before and just liked the name. Mom didn\u2019t clue in until a couple months later when she too heard the neighbour call his dog by her name. And no, my mom didn\u2019t march over and demand they change the dogs name nor did they change mine.", "She better not read the Great Gatsby then and learn the meaning of that Daisy\u2019s name lol. But as you mentioned, this is your cousin\u2019s girlfriend, what if you change the name and then they break up? You would have changed the name for nothing! Lol. \n\nIt\u2019s also not nice to change your dog\u2019s name after you have had her for so long and called her by only that name for so long. \n\nNTA. This is why dogs are better than people. Dog Daisy should keep the name and Human Daisy should fuck off and change her name since she is so bothered by this.", "Bro wtf. I have a unique name that pretty much is only used as a pet name, usually dogs. That\u2019s just the way it is, who gives a fuck? I\u2019m also a server so I introduce myself to people literally all day and people will be like \u201cthat\u2019s my dogs name!\u201d And it makes them happy.

I'm happy to share my name lol( I had a dachshund too who died about 3 yrs ago , so I already had no problem, I was happy to know she too had one). \n\n\nDon't change the name, she probably got adjusted to that name.

Does she think that there's not a single pet in the world with the name Daisy? (I think there are quite a lot honestly) And does she think that everyone who meets a person with their pet's name have to change the name every time that happens? What kind of logic is that? Also dogs are trained to listen to their names, you can't just change the name bc a random person isn't happy about the (objectively unproblematic) name. \n\nJust ignore them, they're being unreasonable and childish. \n\nAlso side note, personally I would be quite happy to meet a puppy with the same name as mine :)", "NTA - you named your dog before you met his new gf.

And Daisy is a cute name for your dog", "NTA, tell her that her name is for flowers and not people. Also, I\u2019ve met tons of pets with the name Daisy, are they all supposed to change the pets name because one person is offended? She\u2019s not that special", "I had a donkey named Daisy a few years ago, that would\u2019ve really pissed her off.", "nTa. Your entire family are unbelievably stupid.", "The most charitable way of looking at this is that she might\u2019ve overreacted like that BECAUSE she has some baggage with people *potentially* teasing/bullying her for having the same name as a mouse. \n\nStill an apology and clearing the air should be sufficient even if that\u2019s the case and the cousin is clearly out of line by asking op to change her dog\u2019s name.", "ADOPT ANOTHER DOG AND NAME IT DAISY JUNIOR.
