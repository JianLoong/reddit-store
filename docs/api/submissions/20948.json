If she can't handle someone having a dog with the same name as her, she's in for a rough life. NTA.

It's understandable that you didn't anticipate her reaction and thought she would laugh it off.\n\nYour cousin's request for you to change your puppy's name because of this incident is unreasonable. Naming your pet is a personal choice, and it's not necessary to alter that choice based on a casual comment made at a family gathering. It's your right to keep the name you've chosen for your puppy.\n\nIt's also worth noting that your cousin's parents getting involved and pressuring you to change the name seems excessive.

What an odd thing to be offended by. Her name is only for people? Um, considering I've seen pets named after celebrities and politicians, I think not. Her thin skin was just looking for offense.

My papa (maternal grandfather) had to have several moles removed--quite a few had grown rather large before they were removed. It impacted their lives a lot. Now, of course, the relativity of the situation can be judged by others, but the point is you still went through something scary that made you face your own mortality. Did it cause you to go through rounds and rounds of chemo? No. But most skin cancers don't arrive at that point *unless they go untreated or show up as a result of even deeper cancer*. And in either case things could have gone very fucky very quickly. You were lucky and caught it before it got bad enough to require all of that, but you had cancer.

Guess she hasn't heard of that famous Duck named Daisy. My daughter's best friend's dog has the same name as my daughter. It causes confusion, but a lot of laughter too.

She thinks it's fantastic!\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your cousin's gf is entitled af. Animals sometimes share human names, it happens. Your cousin's girlfriend sounds like a self-important brat. Maybe this is a particularly sore issue or something, but like you said, you're not particularly close to these people, so they really shouldn't be making it your problem.", "Hahaha! This is the only real solution. Skip the apology and go right for new puppy with cousin's name.", "Yesss, YES. Brilliant solution!!\n\nGive me a break.
