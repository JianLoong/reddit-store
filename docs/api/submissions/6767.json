It\u2019s happened before to people on here. Your MIL reads like the type to go \u201cwell, let\u2019s at least pull it back out of the way in a ponytail\u201d and then cut the ponytail off, and expect them to just roll with it now that they look her idea of acceptable.", "NTA at all \n\nTHe fact that they are trying to cut your daughters hair that theyve clearly put quite a lot of effort into to get it to grow that long , against their consent , is very controlling .

To cut the length by more than 80% just because someone else doesn't like long hair?  RIDICULOUS\n\nI think you are right to drop out of the wedding completely, and to go NC for a while.", "NTA this is so important for your daughters. They now know that their parents have their back, respect their boundaries, and will fight for them. They will know that they can say no, even to family, when they are requesting they do something that\u2019s uncomfortable or not something they want.

In the same message we have:\n\n\"Your parents are **too controlling...**\"\n\nand:\n\n\"If you want this thing that I think you want, develop the habit of **doing as you are told.**\"\n\nHow are these statements both true to MIL?  Most likely because, in MIL's world, all persons of interest exist in order to be controlled.  The issue is not that you are exerting undue control.  The issue is that she thinks you have a keyboard that you use to put commands into your children's minds (because they can't possibly think for themselves, oh no) and she wants you to hand her that keyboard.", "NTA.

These two women have no boundaries.    NC contact sounds like a good plan.  Once you have blocked them from the devices .. check over the next few days regularly.

Nothing infuriates me more as a supposed adult trying to manipulate children for their own gain.   Disgusting behavior.", "NTA\n\nBy letting someone who isn't their parent/guardian control their appearance, you would be infringing on their sense of bodily autonomy which may have a lasting impact in their lives as MIL sounds like the type of person that will keep pressuring them to do what she wants.

This is a ridiculous argument about control and not hair. **Why not do an up-do!** Boom. Problem solved. \n\nIt's not cray cray to let someone give you a french twist for a day.

Honestly I would block MIL\u2019s phone number from your daughter\u2019s phone.  That\u2019s really unacceptable and way out of line for the MIL to text your daughter like that.

My daughter has hair down past her bottom and until the day she tells me she wants it cut, it stays long. \n\nYour MIL is a piece of work though for so many reasons.", "Absolutely NTA! Who tf do they think they are. Good on you for standing your ground!", "NTA - your post said the girls enjoy having long hair. That should be enough for MIL and SIL, but instead these grown women are bullying little girls over an event that is only one day. It would have an enormous impact on these little girls if you took away their autonomy over their hair.", "NTA apart from the obvious I saw no one else mention that MIL didn't want the older two kids at the wedding in the first place because they aren't blood relatives. So her attempt at controlling their bodies seems even more insidious. MIL is gonna die on this hill because she resents you and your daughters for evading her iron grip multiple times (not letting her organize your wedding, having your kids at SILs wedding, not cutting their hair)", "NTA. Your MiL is harassing children so she can have her perfect vision of a wedding. She's totally bridezilla by proxy.\nI feel sorry for your SIL being caught in this drama. But she's supporting her mother in downplaying this to a trim. Removing several feet of hair is not a trim.\nAll credit to you for removing your children from this circus. If want to be nice to SIL, ask them out to pre or post-wedding meal as extra celebration.", "NTA, and if I were you I would go NC rather than LC. Your MIL is trying to bully your daughters and your SIL is publicly lying about you.", "Totally NTA.

You took into consideration what the owners of the hair wanted, and defended them against those who think they can control their bodies without their or your permission. \n\nThere are kids who would do anything to have a parent go to bat for them like this. Thank you from a total stranger for being an A+ mom.", "NTA.  Your children can choose how they want their hair.  I once had all my hair cut off because I used to chew on my hair. Granted it helped the issue but I definitely didn\u2019t want to do it.  So much happened to us as children that I\u2019m glad parents are taking a stand. No they don\u2019t have to cut their hair or keep it long. No you don\u2019t get a hug or a kiss just because you\u2019re family.  All these things!  I\u2019m sorry you have this woman as a MIL.", "I don\u2019t get it - put their hair in an elegant chignon. It won\u2019t matter then how long it is. Problem solved. \n\nNTA. It\u2019s one day as opposed to the years it takes to grow hair that long. Don\u2019t cave to emotional blackmail.", "No one is cutting my daughter's hair if she wants it long. there are hairstyles they can do that wouldn't require a haircut, btw that's not a \"trim\". don't attend, i'm sure they'll find other girls with shoulder length hair to join them in the wedding.", "NTA and here is a compromise: your kids and MIL will remove the exact same length of hair: if your MIL (who I picture with the typical KRN haircut) removes 10 cm of hair, then the girls also remove 10 cm of hair. Good luck to her getting a buzzcut ahead of the wedding, to get her way :)", "NTA and your responses have been spot on. Your immediate family is golden; but the in-laws? Oh boy!", "NTA.

Let him continue to do a good job.", "NTA\n\nFirst and foremost, I don't care if you're getting married, if you're pregnant, if you're a mom or  whatever causes someone to be a zilla in the moment. Nothing, not a thing, gives you the right to determine the physical autonomy of another human being. Secondly, \"a little hair trim\" is not a full foot+ of hair cut off to make it \"shoulder length.\" Thirdly, you're not ruining shit, your involvement isn't necessary, and the wedding can occur without you. If their marital bliss is so contingent on looks maybe they shouldn't even bother getting married.", "NTA, I wouldn't let MIL or SIL anywhere near the girls. I could see a haircut happening very quickly. Just a quick snip of a scissors and a big chunk of hair gone.", "I\u2019d never leave them alone with anyone from mils side.

The nerve of some people. \n\nHonestly it's crazy that your SIL is ruining her OWN wedding by obsessing over \"a little hair trim\". If it was so little then why not let it go? They know what they're doing. \n\nThere was a comment about doing an up-do hair style. That type of style could be done and still be princess-like but they're not going to be given the chance to see the style anyways. Good for you for not going.

I would find that Facebook page where they\u2019re playing the victim and attach the message your MIL sent your 12 year old daughter and ask everyone to judge who\u2019s the AH.

I wouldn't recommend it though.", "NTA- \n\nAfter wanting to exclude your daughters from the get go I would of blocked contact from them and MIL and pulled all kids from the ceremony. \n\nIt sounds like she\u2019s trying to use the hair as an excuse to get what she wanted to begin with, them not in the wedding. I would tell her that none of my children will be in the wedding nor attending and my husband and I wouldn\u2019t either.", "NTA. What matters here is what your children want. Do they want their hair cut for the wedding? No? Then their hair doesn\u2019t get cut. End of story. Block your MIL and SIL from their devices and consider what\u2019s best for your children here.

This is ridiculous.", "NTA, block your mother-in-law from contacting your kids, and honestly I would say don't go to the wedding.

You never get to dictate what someone else does to their body.  Wedding or not.  Your MIL WAY crossed a boundary.  I'm glad your spouse is on board.  Time for them to deal with some consequences of their actions.\n\nFrom a hygeine perspective though, having your kids hair regularly trimmed like a couple times a year to clean ends that are easy to comb through is just a good idea in general.  I most definitely don't mean SHORT by any stretch just that it will shed and catch less and look healthier. Also saying that as a parent who has dealt with lice in long hair.   Having parented a kid through these ages with long hair, my daughter did need some help with maintance and hygenine and keeping it looking good.  It was much easier to maintain that with clean ends.  So this is an aside, maybe your kids hair looks healthy and amazing.  I just don't know how a healthy active 12 year old with knee length hair that is never cut can't be dragging that through toliets, food, dirt, etc.", "A little trim?

If there were more mothers as you, the world would be a better place.", "Is there a subtext here that you're not revealing? Long hair is beautiful when it is healthy and the grower wants it and can care for it. This would be very hard for a 6-year old.  Do you spend a lot of your day washing and braiding your children's hair so it is comfortably out of their way? Can they participate in sports and their activities, hair out of the way? Is their hair presentable and appropriately clean, noting the realities of being a child? Is there some sort of religious background about cutting / not cutting hair? This is too weird. If the children's hair is uncared-for, then YTA. If the children are under religious cult rules, YTA. Terrifying red flag I saw only in my third reading: \"she has to learn to do as she is told\". This is a scary sentence, and leads to abuse and controlling behavior.
