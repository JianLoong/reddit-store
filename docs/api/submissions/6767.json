It\u2019s happened before to people on here. Your MIL reads like the type to go \u201cwell, let\u2019s at least pull it back out of the way in a ponytail\u201d and then cut the ponytail off, and expect them to just roll with it now that they look her idea of acceptable.", "NTA at all \n\nTHe fact that they are trying to cut your daughters hair that theyve clearly put quite a lot of effort into to get it to grow that long , against their consent , is very controlling .

To cut the length by more than 80% just because someone else doesn't like long hair?  RIDICULOUS\n\nI think you are right to drop out of the wedding completely, and to go NC for a while.", "NTA this is so important for your daughters. They now know that their parents have their back, respect their boundaries, and will fight for them. They will know that they can say no, even to family, when they are requesting they do something that\u2019s uncomfortable or not something they want.

In the same message we have:\n\n\"Your parents are **too controlling...**\"\n\nand:\n\n\"If you want this thing that I think you want, develop the habit of **doing as you are told.**\"\n\nHow are these statements both true to MIL?  Most likely because, in MIL's world, all persons of interest exist in order to be controlled.  The issue is not that you are exerting undue control.  The issue is that she thinks you have a keyboard that you use to put commands into your children's minds (because they can't possibly think for themselves, oh no) and she wants you to hand her that keyboard.", "NTA.

These two women have no boundaries.    NC contact sounds like a good plan.  Once you have blocked them from the devices .. check over the next few days regularly.

Nothing infuriates me more as a supposed adult trying to manipulate children for their own gain.   Disgusting behavior.", "NTA\n\nBy letting someone who isn't their parent/guardian control their appearance, you would be infringing on their sense of bodily autonomy which may have a lasting impact in their lives as MIL sounds like the type of person that will keep pressuring them to do what she wants.

This is a ridiculous argument about control and not hair. **Why not do an up-do!** Boom. Problem solved. \n\nIt's not cray cray to let someone give you a french twist for a day.

Honestly I would block MIL\u2019s phone number from your daughter\u2019s phone.  That\u2019s really unacceptable and way out of line for the MIL to text your daughter like that.

My daughter has hair down past her bottom and until the day she tells me she wants it cut, it stays long. \n\nYour MIL is a piece of work though for so many reasons.", "Absolutely NTA! Who tf do they think they are. Good on you for standing your ground!", "NTA - your post said the girls enjoy having long hair. That should be enough for MIL and SIL, but instead these grown women are bullying little girls over an event that is only one day. It would have an enormous impact on these little girls if you took away their autonomy over their hair.", "NTA apart from the obvious I saw no one else mention that MIL didn't want the older two kids at the wedding in the first place because they aren't blood relatives. So her attempt at controlling their bodies seems even more insidious. MIL is gonna die on this hill because she resents you and your daughters for evading her iron grip multiple times (not letting her organize your wedding, having your kids at SILs wedding, not cutting their hair)", "NTA. Your MiL is harassing children so she can have her perfect vision of a wedding. She's totally bridezilla by proxy.\nI feel sorry for your SIL being caught in this drama. But she's supporting her mother in downplaying this to a trim. Removing several feet of hair is not a trim.\nAll credit to you for removing your children from this circus. If want to be nice to SIL, ask them out to pre or post-wedding meal as extra celebration.", "NTA, and if I were you I would go NC rather than LC. Your MIL is trying to bully your daughters and your SIL is publicly lying about you.", "Totally NTA.

You took into consideration what the owners of the hair wanted, and defended them against those who think they can control their bodies without their or your permission. \n\nThere are kids who would do anything to have a parent go to bat for them like this. Thank you from a total stranger for being an A+ mom.", "NTA.  Your children can choose how they want their hair.  I once had all my hair cut off because I used to chew on my hair. Granted it helped the issue but I definitely didn\u2019t want to do it.  So much happened to us as children that I\u2019m glad parents are taking a stand. No they don\u2019t have to cut their hair or keep it long. No you don\u2019t get a hug or a kiss just because you\u2019re family.  All these things!  I\u2019m sorry you have this woman as a MIL.", "I don\u2019t get it - put their hair in an elegant chignon. It won\u2019t matter then how long it is. Problem solved. \n\nNTA. It\u2019s one day as opposed to the years it takes to grow hair that long. Don\u2019t cave to emotional blackmail.", "No one is cutting my daughter's hair if she wants it long. there are hairstyles they can do that wouldn't require a haircut, btw that's not a \"trim\". don't attend, i'm sure they'll find other girls with shoulder length hair to join them in the wedding.", "NTA and here is a compromise: your kids and MIL will remove the exact same length of hair: if your MIL (who I picture with the typical KRN haircut) removes 10 cm of hair, then the girls also remove 10 cm of hair. Good luck to her getting a buzzcut ahead of the wedding, to get her way :)", "NTA and your responses have been spot on. Your immediate family is golden; but the in-laws? Oh boy!", "NTA.

Let him continue to do a good job.", "NTA\n\nFirst and foremost, I don't care if you're getting married, if you're pregnant, if you're a mom or  whatever causes someone to be a zilla in the moment. Nothing, not a thing, gives you the right to determine the physical autonomy of another human being. Secondly, \"a little hair trim\" is not a full foot+ of hair cut off to make it \"shoulder length.\" Thirdly, you're not ruining shit, your involvement isn't necessary, and the wedding can occur without you. If their marital bliss is so contingent on looks maybe they shouldn't even bother getting married.", "NTA, I wouldn't let MIL or SIL anywhere near the girls. I could see a haircut happening very quickly. Just a quick snip of a scissors and a big chunk of hair gone.", "I\u2019d never leave them alone with anyone from mils side.

Stay strong and keep supporting your daughters and their beautiful hair.", "NTA. \n\nInfo: Do the kids like having their long hair?", "NTA\n\n\u201cSIL has taken to social media and is complaining that we are trying to ruin her wedding over a little hair trim.\u201d Classic manipulation. Flip it around and make you out to be the ones overreacting. When they\u2019re the ones convinced that the girl\u2019s HAIR can ruin the wedding. Absurd beyond imagination. They\u2019re overstepping and it sounds like this isn\u2019t the first time.\n\nThis kind of mess irritates me so much. When you get married, the wedding party is not your dolls. They\u2019re not decorations. They\u2019re not pawns. They\u2019re not ornaments on your tree. They\u2019re PEOPLE. And you should be grateful to have them in your life. And you should understand that only a few people in your life *actually* care that you\u2019re getting married, and it\u2019s not wrong of everyone else to not care. Why should they? Not a one of us is special or entitled to praise just for getting married. Have some humility and appreciate that you have people in your life who are willing to help out at all. Be glad if you have people who are genuinely excited as many of us do not. Just be happy that you\u2019re getting married and stop obsessing over the particulars of the ceremony. But no, so many people\u2019s true feelings come out in weddings. Suddenly their closest friends and family become things. It\u2019s disgusting.", "Kuddos to your husband for standing up to his sister and mom.  You are NTA, but your MIL sure qualifies.", "NTA. Your MIL needs to learn boundaries. Cutting waist/knee length hair to shoulder length is way more than a \u2018little\u2019 trim, it\u2019s a drastic change. \n\nI used to have hair that went down just past my waist and I cut it just below my shoulder blades, and everyone was shocked because it was such a massive change. It takes a while to get used to, but that was my doing. I couldn\u2019t imagine someone forcing me to cut my hair and then having to live with it until it grew back to its original length. That would take years.", "Honestly, the OP is the asshole for not pulling the girls' out of the wedding and keeping them away from this drama. They're being harassed by their grandmother and the bride is co-signing grandma's opinion and behavior.", "[deleted]", "agree with you", "Right!", "What is it with people thinking they have literally any way at all over another person\u2019s hair?\n\nI\u2019m reading all sorts of wants to cut bridesmaids hair and refuses to let their children cut their own hair because purity bs and I\u2019m just confused when it started being okay to do this.", "Also, cutting someone\u2019s hair without consent can be construed as assault. You may want to mention that to them", "The OP said they pulled out of the wedding..", "I'll disagree with you on that.  It's hard cause of the ingrained \"but family\" narrative., especially for women.  Took me close to 50 years to fully cut mine out.  All I can do is wish op the strength to get thru this.", "[deleted]", "MIL and SIL are also willing to exclude them from the weddings because the hair is too long, which absolutely feels controlling.", "That is assault.  Anyone cutting your hair or your child's hair w/o permission need to be charged with assault.", "Her wedding can only be ruined if she allows it to be. Just because she wants some thing, doesn\u2019t mean she gets it, especially when it\u2019s concerning another person. She has absolutely no right to ask that your girls cut their hair. She can talk to you about options for a hairstyle for them but that\u2019s it.  I cannot believe that they would ask this.", "I would never leave them with anyone from the military. Every day, children's hair is cut without their permission.", "It took grandma messaging their daughter directly with her bullshit for them to finally do anything.", "Good bot", "Good bot! I was just going to report that comment as Spam/then Harmful Bot.  It didn't follow the flow in a thread. OP wrote then the rest is like a shirt/sweater and each comment to the OP is one thread.  Comments to other comments are the weft and warp. Woven together= coherent and cohesion. This comment jumped out like a knot or thread pull.", "Definitely this. I'd imagine a message from a family member they otherwise love and look up to could also be extremely hurtful to the girls."]}
