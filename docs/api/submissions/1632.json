You are absolutely correct that it's unfair to your fiance having erotic photos of your ex in the household and it was kind and thoughtful of you to offer them back to your ex instead of just chucking them out! Many years ago, when my now husband and I had just moved in together, I found some old erotic photos that his ex-wife had gifted him during their marriage. It was one of our only true fights we've ever had in the 14 years we've been together . I wish he had done the same back then as you did! Good job", "Nah.\n\nI think you should have chucked them, as that would not have caused a confrontation, but I don't think anyone is out of line here.", "You broke up 4 years ago.

Why not just throw them away?", "NTA-\n\nBut that was an awful present in my opinion lol. You would've expected her to gift OP pictures of them/their relationship  (OP and ex) as his present not pictures of herself! WHO GETS SOMEONE PHOTOS OF THEIR 'SLAMMIN' BODY AS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT ??\n\nShe seems like a very me-me person and I think she got offended by you returning those pictures ( EVEN THOUGH YOU GUYS HAVE BROKEN UP, HAVE NEW PARTNERS AND THE FACT THAT KEEPING THOSE EROTIC PICTURES  WOULD BE OFFENSIVE YOUR  NOW FIANCE ) because WHO would ever return pictures of her SLAMMIN BODY??", "Why are you still hung up on this?

Or throwing them without telling her, you're no longer obligated to her and should've gotten rid of intimate things like that. Even moreso after getting a new partner. I expect my exes to get rid off nudes I've sent/given them once we break up, and I expect them to not have nudes/suggestive photos of their exes laying around. Mind you I've maintained a good friendship or ended in good terms with most of my exes and it would make me uncomfortable knowing they have those things around after we break up, much more if they have a new partner, and you're engaged? And she's married? Not sure why you kept them at all. You're obligated to your fiance, not your ex. And your ex is out of place for feeling offended you're returning them.", "ESH\n\nWhen you broke up, you should have asked if she wanted them back.

People should offer to return things to an ex that  are meaningful to them. It was a thoughtful gift so long as you were together. \n\nI\u2019m not one for the fiction that people were born the moment they laid eyes on each other\u2014 people have stuff from their past and their new partners should get that. But big framed bedroom pictures of their ex in lingerie, no, that\u2019s weird.\n\nEdit\u2014 after reading your comments, it\u2019s clear these photos represent her in her mind\u2014 that she thinks you\u2019ve rejected her and her \u201cslamming\u201d body and she wants you to look at them for the rest of your life and cry about the beautiful body you once had in your bed. And that\u2019s not fair to you or your fianc\u00e9e. I don\u2019t know how y\u2019all broke up or if she\u2019s right to be mad. But people play these silly games when they feel rejected. So maybe you should have thrown them out rather than interact with her again, I don\u2019t know. this \u201cdon\u2019t ya wish your girlfriend was hot like me\u201d is kind of pathetic but understandable.", "NTA. She likes the thought of you still \"enjoying\" her photos. She likes the thought of making your future partners uncomfortable.

And was resolved 4 years ago. Yet it's still at the forefront of your mind, 4 years later, to the extent that you're posting about it here. \n\nIt doesn't even sound like it was a big deal. Your ex was \"sort of affronted\" for a few days. Sounds normal enough in the context of the heightened emotions people feel during/right after a breakup, and it was an awkward situation.\n\nWhat's much weirder is how enmeshed you still seem with you ex if you still feel like you need additional resolution (on top of it all being \"water under the bridge\" and everyone involved still being close friends) 4 years later.", "NAH I just think\u2026.it\u2019s almost like you told her \u201cnow I have someone else I have no use for these\u201d almost like they were uh \u2026being used while you were between relationships. \n\nI just wouldn\u2019t have touched the conversation.

ANd: Why make your partner's insecurites public?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: You will certainly not like when the story that you think your ex is much hotter that your current partner and she would thus be threatened by ex's pictures makes the round to your new partner.

Real weird of her to be offended and upset by this.", "Why didn't you just do what everyone else does and quietly throw them away? Like, what was the expectation here? That she'd use them herself?

It had to do with her views about her own body and what she feels comfortable with.\n\nYou wanted to return them because your decision to keep them depended on having/not having a partner. Her decision to not want them back didn\u2019t depend on anyone but herself.\n\nI think you clearly meant well, but since she\u2019s already made clear these photos were yours to keep I wouldn\u2019t have brought them up again to her.", "An ex asking you to keep pics of her in lingerie isn\u2019t a request you need to honour, no matter how friendly you remain.", ">I would have posted this if there were any of my friends who actually know what my Reddit ID is?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour friends will not learn the story from reddit, but from your ex telling it - it IS a funny annecdote about how you see your new partner and harass your ex over it.
