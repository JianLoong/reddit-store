Then he goes out, sleeps all day and then is mean on your anniversary?\n\nExactly how low are your standards because he\u2019s not sounding like he\u2019s worth any of it.", "NTA. I just don\u2019t think he puts in as much effort in the relationship compared to you. But INFO: what was his reaction to you asking him why he doesn\u2019t have money on him? Did he give a reason?", "Stop offering your boyfriend a better life than he is offering you. He\u2019s not putting the effort in you are or pulling his fair share of the weight in your relationship. \n\n What exactly is he contributing since he\u2019s a drain on your finances, doesn\u2019t show you any consideration, and isn\u2019t doing anything thoughtful for you? What makes him worth paying for the privilege of being let down by him?", "He\u2019s using you. Leave immediately.", "After four years together you should have a pretty good idea where he spends the majority of his money. The fact that you have no idea means that he is deliberately hiding it from you.\n\nI'm glad he's a bf and not a fianc\u00e9 because you surely do need a conversation without distractions or deflections.

I don\u2019t just mean financially (though that\u2019s a factor as well), but also emotionally. It\u2019s not just about not buying dinner, there\u2019s also the complete lack of planning, time, or effort on his part. And he was actively rude to you when *he is the one* who decided to go out late on the night before your *pre-arranged plans* and sleep the whole day away.\n\nDoes he do that kind of thing often? Because that might be where his money is going.\n\nYou deserve to be seen as an equal partner, not a sugar mommy\u2026which it kinda sounds like he\u2019s begun to see you as.", "NTA. He should be contributing as much as you are to the relationship.", "NTA. I would wonder too. Maybe he overslept on purpose because he knew he'd spent all his money and couldn't afford to go out.", "Your partner is asleep at dinner time? Unless they have a night shift job that tells you all there is to know.", "NTA.\n\nI would seriously question staying in this relationship, though. You\u2019re putting in a lot more effort than he is, and it\u2019s not like that is going to magically change.", "NTA. But as long as you keep on paying more for the bills, he's going to carry on letting you. Stop enabling him. Tell him you will only be covering half from now on, and stick to it. \n\nHe can spend all his money partying because he knows you'll cover things. He's using you. Stop letting him.", "If he partied the night before to the extent that he slept all day, he probably spent a shit-ton of $$. This may sound harsh, but it seems like you're not his priority, nor is your relationship. It's time to re-evaluate. At just 22, he may feel trapped and would rather party than celebrate the four years you've been together. Good luck. \n\nNTA", "Is he buying weed, alcohol, onlyfans subscriptions, etc?", "NTA. You are a decent amount of time into a relationship with this person and a fairly important factor in modern relationships in finances.

I would also want to know wtf my partner was is doing with their money when basic things like groceries are massively one sided.", "NTA he needs to contribute", "Nta. You live together and share responsibilities and he's not pulling his weight. \n\nDid he actually explain where his moneys going?", "At worst drugs or gambling.

It's not fair to not split expenses equally if you have similar salaries.  But you seem entitled and only concerned with keeping score.  That's not good long term", "NAH. He might be saving for important things he needs. So it's  understandable if he needs to save money. You seem to be overspending a lot on things. Have you tried saving money yourself?", "ESH... I seriously am having a problem tonight by reading these things.  You are ridiculous and so is he.  Just stop, right now, stop..
