We dont have enough space to give each kid their own room, so I and my wife decided that it would be best for our daughters to share a room while C gets his own. Our reasoning is that A and B are the same gender and much closer in age to each other than C, so it wouldn\u2019t be hard for them to share. This was never a problem up until about a month ago when A started complaining for her own room, and magically as soon as A started wanting her own space B did too. I\u2019ve explained to them both a million times that we dont have enough rooms in our house for that, but the nagging still hasnt ended.\n\nThe other issue is birthdays. A and B\u2019s birthdays are coincidentally very close together, so my wife and I have them compromise on a restaurant they both like and hold one party there for both of them rather than having to do two separate parties in one month. Obviously they both get their own gifts and get to invite their own friends and family members, they just have to share on the restaurant choice and celebrate on the same day. C\u2019s birthday is a ways away from A and B\u2019s, so we host another celebration just for him. A and B have been accusing me of favoring C since he gets more to himself than they do, but I dont think Im in the wrong here.

Siblings have to share sometimes, so that's understandable. But the birthday thing is, and I'm sorry if this offends you, very stupid. The girls share a room, they feel their little brother is favored. Give them separate parties. They don't share a birthday, they shouldn't have to share a celebration. This is one thing, one day a year, where they can each have the attention solely on themselves. Let them have it.", "YTA.  Your daughters are begging for individuality and private space.  I understand that you can\u2019t do anything about the space aside from move,  but you should at least let them each have their own party!", "YTA\n\nThey are correct though. \n\nThe room thing is unfortunate, you can't really change it. But you could look which room is the biggest bedroom in your house and have A and B spare it, get some dividers etc and get some more privacy for your daughters. \n\nBut there is zero reason for them to have to have a joined birthday party.", "YTA you have 3 kids not 2. that means 3 birthday parties or 0. \n\nthe room thing I get, you can't magically add a room onto the house.", "YTA.  You do realize that your daughters deserve to be recognized as individuals and deserve to be celebrated as such. It's weird to force them to share a party, let alone combining a group of 11 and 13 yr olds.  Making them choose a restaurant they can agree upon is also unfair. It literally costs you nothing more to give them their ONE day a year, that is supposed to be about them as individuals.  \n\nWhile not being able to provide them their own room is not possible, providing them their own birthday is.\n\nShow your daughter's their thoughts and feelings matter.  Do better.", "YTA\n\nyour reasoning about sharing the room is not wrong but A&B are not little children anymore and you need to stop treating them like toddlers.\n\nif you can\u2019t afford a bigger place to live, instal a room divider or a curtain.

Oh good lord. Why do parents never get it? Being siblings doesn't mean that the girls have to share every single flipping thing in their lives. They deserve to be treated as individuals and have things that are just for them. Which means not having to share a party every year or having to compromise on so much when their brother doesn't have to.\n\nSo I'll tell you the same thing that I told my cousin when she acted just like you in regard to her kids: Stop being so dang cheap and let the girls have their own things.

Every kid deserves their OWN bday celebration unless they ask to share.\n\nThat said, the room thing, NTA.

Just because it's more convenient for you treating two individuals as one will make them feel you favor your son.\n\nAnd the room thing is a slightly less YTA. I can understand you can't add a room out of nowhere. But have you *asked* your daughters how they expect a solution to look like instead of telling them \"no\" each time? Maybe you can find a solution together. \n\nMy parents for example split the living room in half by adding a temporary wall. But they already did that when I was born, while my brother was 7. When my brother moved out I moved in the former small living room and the wall was removed to have a bigger living room again. And even if you aren't allowed to add extra walls you could at least think about curtains or folding screens.", "Well, they\u2019re not wrong. \n\nCongratulations on making your favorite abundantly clear.

At least try to hide your lazy fart favouritism and give them separate something. Birthday parties are a gimme. What else are you not telling us?", "YTA about the birthdays. They should each get their own, separate celebration.\n\nIt's harder with the rooms but their wish for their own space is normal and reasonable.  Even if you can't give them separate rooms, look at what you can do.\nFor instance, is it possible to rearrange thr bedrooms so they have the largest,  and to look at whether there is any way to divide it, even if only with a curtain,  to give them each some privacy? Would there be any way to convert another room in the house?\n\nBut yeah, you are clearly favoring Corey and its no surprise that they can see that and resent it.", "YTA for the birthday thing. It may be convenient for you to make them share a birthday while your son doesn't, but that doesn't make it right or magically not favouritism. Just means the person you are actually favouring over them is yourself and what's easy for you, and your son getting better treatment is a byproduct.\n\nMild YTA for the bedroom thing. You made the right choice on who should share but the wrong choice in not validating their feelings, because they are valid and you can acknowledge that while still acknowledging they have to keep sharing the room, and the wrong choice in not taking any steps to maximise privacy and personal space within the shared room.\n\nHell just putting a curtain or room divider between their beds would be something.", "My older sister and my birthdays are 6 days apart, shared a bedroom and we also have a little brother born months later and my parents never made us share a birthday what's wrong with you yta", "The daughters are totally going to resent their brother and go LC with the entire family.

You are favoring the boy in this scenario by allowing him to be the only individual in that house.", "I wouldnt say asshole, but a little insensitive. Your girls are expressing a need for individual time and attention from you, and also a need for their own space.

They are way too old to share birthdays, and to be honest I'm shocked they've put up with it as long as they have. Also, you are going to have to figure out some way of getting those two girls their own private space, or your life is going to be a nightmare. You're about to have two teenage girls forced to share a bedroom while their elementary school little brother gets his own room. I'm surprised you're even trying it. Kids need more privacy and more space as they get older, not less. I would give the smallest bedroom to the oldest girl and put a wall up in the middle of the biggest bedroom (even if the biggest bedroom is yours) for the other two kids before I'd make the two oldest share.

My middle brother is in July and there are 3 years between us. When we were little we all got presents at Xmas and we all got presents in July. As we grew that stopped and each did our own thing at our birthdays. Brothers shared a room and as they got older they partitioned their room so each had a side. One brother was excessively tidy and the other really wasn\u2019t so it was quite funny \ud83d\ude04 but it worked for them, I thought.
