We\u2019ve been friends for like 7 years now.\nAlso going to add I am autistic but as far as I am aware she is not.\n\nEvery single thing we do is because she wants to. We eat where she wants and when she wants, we shop where she wants, she\u2019s even tried to stop me drinking my preferred drinks because she wants us to have the same drinks.\nIt\u2019s been going like this for the past 2 weeks.\n\nI\u2019m getting frustrated because this isn\u2019t a trip for HER. We both needed a break from life so did this cruise. But anytime I want to do something she shoots me down or sulks and gives me attitude and passive aggressive remarks because she didn\u2019t get her way.\n\nI lost it today at her. It started when I decided at 9:30am I was going to go get breakfast - I asked if she wanted to come and she said no cos it\u2019s too early for her and she said that I should wait til she wants to eat. I decided to go anyway and when I got back she was asleep.\nShe woke up around 1pm. Got mad I hadn\u2019t woken her up and then got mad I had left the room and \u2018abandoned her\u2019. I ended up raising my voice and said I wasn\u2019t her personal lackey and this was my holiday too and I was going to do as I pleased for the next week.\n\nNow she\u2019s giving me the cold shoulder and is getting shitty with me at EVERYTHING.\n\nWas I in the wrong for getting frustrated?\nShe\u2019s making me feel like the villain", "created_utc": 1701515580, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1891l0a/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_im_done_playing/", "score": 5, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
