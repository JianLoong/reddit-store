She treats you Like a lackey and you deserve a break from her", "NTA, but I am questioning if this person actually sees you as a friend and not an accessory that walks and talks and agrees with her. That's the only reason I can see for insisting on being twinsies even for beverages and sulking like a toddler every time you dare to *gasp!* have an opinion outside of hers.    \nStop catering to her. Stop doing activities with her, since she will do her best to make sure you don't enjoy them as petty revenge for having wants in the first place. Do not cave to her immature tantrums- she's already taken 2 weeks of holiday from you, don't let her suck your enjoyment from the rest. Separate yourself as much as you can, enjoy the rest of your cruise, and have a good, long talk with your 'friend' about her terrible behaviour towards you when you get back. \n\nTL:DR Friends don't treat friends the way she's treated you.", "Nta. Y'all could compromise on stuff, but you both have to be willing for that to work.", "NTA but you should have put your foot down sooner because as you said, it's your holiday too.", "NTA... assert yourself.  You don't need to do the same as she is doing to you but you can tell her what your plans  are and she can like it or lump it.", "Nta she doesn't owe you and she needs to stop being so controlling. Your allowed to go out and enjoy your time time. Unless she's paying for the trip, meals and drinks and pays for the stuff you by at the shops she gets no say in what you do when you eat what you eat and drink and what stores you go into.\n\nYour also not her alarm clock. She's an adult she could have set the alarm clock to wake her up or she didn't have to nap if going out was such a big deal to her. \n\nGo and enjoy your trip. Who cares if she's mad and control you anymore. At least now you know how she will be on future trips and you can decide to go with her or not.", "NTA the explosiveness mixed with the concept of abandonment, plus the egocentric traits, smell of BPL.\n\nThat said, you shouldn't diagnose your friend, it is just irregular behavior that requires for limits to be set clearly, even if she pours at them at first", "NTA. Honestly, this doesn't sound like a friendship. It sounds more like your 'friend' is infantilizing you because of your autism. It's sounding like she thinks you don't know what you want and thinks she herself knows what you *should* want.", "Yikes! She is behaving horribly. Is it only this trip, or has she been like this all along? In any case, you're NTA here.", "NTA. Your friend is being totally unreasonable. Your drink preference should not affect her. If you are hungry at 9:30, you cannot wait hours until she decides to get up.\n\nThe nice thing about cruises is that there is always a lot going on and even married couples can split up and do their own thing while getting back together in an hour or two. \n\nEnjoy your last week of the cruise. Wish I were with you.", "Eeesh NTA - she's overbearing and selfish in thinking she can tell you when you get to eat, but to override your orders too? I don't think I'd call this person a friend. You're allowed to take turns on deciding where you go, neither of you should have a say in what the other eats/drinks, and you're allowed to not be attached at the hip the entire trip. Do yourself a kindness and reconsider this friendship when you get home.", "NTA", "Ugh this \u201cfriend\u201d sure sounds like quite the character. NTA and if i were you i\u2019d start putting my foot down every time she comes with an \u201corder\u201d this way she will see you established a boundary and you\u2019re not going to tolerate her behavior anymore. And if she gets mad or threats to end the friendship or whatever? Good riddance.", "NTA, she wants you to agree with her wants and needs instead of doing things you both agree on.  She sounds like has has \"its all about me, what I want\" syndrome.  Basically she's going to not talk with you and give you the silent treatment till you do what she wants.  I would ignore her and do what you want and she can kick rocks.", "People need to stop suggesting mental illness every time someone is an ass. The \u201cFriend\u201d is likely just a selfish asshole. You say don\u2019t diagnose your friend but that is exactly what you are trying to do."]}
