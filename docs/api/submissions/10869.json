She Always told me that I'm not good enough While she treated my younger brother like a golden child. So I moved to my dad and my (step)mom and my (half)siblings. \nI build up a good life for me and make my money with an online business and good investments. My mom and dad are very proud of me for that, but my mother still thinks I should go back to school/University. \nOne of my investments was a nice house in another country. \nI moved there and I couldn't be happier cause that's where I met my now husband 37/m. His parents are my neighbors. They're amazing and actually introduced us to each other cause we both love photography. \nMy In-laws and my family get really good along, Except from my mother. She thinks I should have married someone from my own country and that I should move back there cause it's hard for her to visit us a couple times a year. \nWell, my husband and I always knew that we wanted to adopt and 3 years ago we were able to welcome 3 boys into our home. They're 5, 8 and 11 and brothers. \nBoth our familys took them in as they had been always been there and they even spend two weeks in the summer at my parents house. \nWhen my mother came to visit us for a week she couldn't stop telling them what to do and what not. For example all of them have a part of chores even if it is just helping with setting up the table or feeding the cats. \nShe made a lot of comments about the parents should do all that stuff. She even tried to get into my son's rooms to clean them up or move the furniture around. \nMy husband and I think that their rooms are their responsibility and we don't enter them without permission. And we only help them cleaning up if they asked for it. They keep clean most of the time Anyway. And they have locks and keys for their doors cause we think privacy is a big deal. \nWhen I saw trying to go while my boss where at school I told that it is against the rules and hurts their trust. She brushed me off but I caught her again a couple hours later. \nThat's when I asked her, why she can't respect my rules in my house and my way of parenting. \nShe said that as long as she is my mother and these filthy gold diggers try to live in my home she has every right to make sure they're are not stealing and using me and my husband just because we adopted them. \nI immediately kicked her out. I pushed her out of my house and closed the door, before I packed her stuff and threw it to her feet. \nI blocked her number and told her if shes not getting of my property I would call the cops. \n\nShe got a flight back home and is trying to blow up my phone, my husbands and the ones of my In-Laws. She even tried to get my dad to speak to me. And my brother is telling me I am an Ungrateful asshole for doing something like this tk my own mother who only tried to help. \nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1677331336, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11bkw05/aita_for_kicking_out_my_mother_like_that/", "score": 927, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are raising them in the ways you and your husband see fit and loving. Your mom has no say in that. Period!\n\nShe came to your home as a guest, not as a boss. She definitely overstepped the bounds. Let me guess, when you grew up you probably heard \"my house, my rules\" on a regular basis.

But remember she may also have been raised in an environment with majorly overbearing parents and she learnt her parenting from them. For that you can cut her a little slack, but still keep a tight hold on the reins. If she does ever visit, pack her off to a hotel and only ever meet in public places where you can have a quick way to cut the visit short until she learns to behave.\n\nFor your brother to be defending your mom's behaviour tells me that he is still under her thumb and doesn't feel the need to break from it. Golden children tend to keep on the parent's side. And don't... can't see anything wrong with their parent/child dynamic. Often the one who breaks free like you as overeacting and exaggerating.

These boys have been with you for 3 years now, so they would have been about 2, 5 and 8 years old when they came to live with you permanently. She called those little boys \u201cfilthy gold diggers\u201d who will take advantage of you and steal from you.  I would have been furious too, and you actually were remarkably restrained in the circumstances.  I would have wanted to launch her into orbit for that.  They are your sons, not trash.  You wouldn\u2019t want a stranger on the street to say that, so you certainly wouldn\u2019t want your own mother to say that about your children under your own roof.  I don\u2019t know what your mother told your brother, but you need to enlighten him on the facts about her awful conduct.  NTA", "NTA. I love your shiny spine!  Well done protecting your family", "NTA\n\nYour mother on the other hand is. She dared calling them gold diggers.

Just to be clear your mum is not trying to help. Your mum is trashing your life choices. She crapped on where you live, your job, your spouse, and your kids. For heavens sake, she called your sons \u201dgold digger!\u201d Who the hell does that?!?! A terrible person, that\u2019s who! Keep protecting yourself and your family from your dreadful mum! Edit: spelling", "NTA soundslike time to go no contact", "NTA. I am so proud of you. 1000% protecting your family \ud83d\udc9e", "NTA, and I'd cut her and your brother off a.s.a.p.  She's horrible!", "But to call your children gold diggers! That's abominable! I would cut both her and your brother out of your life, go completely NC, and leave to them each other.", "I just thought it was cause they live just an hour away and not because they share the same DNA.", " She can\u2019t run your life like you are a little kid, and now she is blowing up your phone and has little flying monkeys harassing you.", "OP was way ahead of you on that.  OP, I'm very proud of you for believing your mother the first time when she showed you who she is.", "Cut your mom off. Your first responsibility is to protect your children, and you are doing that. Your mom sucks. You have every right to cut her off.", "NTA. She was being disrespectful in your home and as long as she was in your home she is subject to your rules.", "NTA. She called your children \u201cgold diggers\u201d. What does that even mean? They\u2019re not adults who have sought you out to get something from you. They\u2019re children and to need to be adopted, something serious and traumatic has clearly happened in their lives. Bless you and your husband for giving them a beautiful life with loving parents who respect them and are obviously doing all you can to make them feel safe including protecting them from a woman who does not love them and is actively resentful of them. She and your brother can spend all their time together being bitter and nasty. You don\u2019t need to participate in that. I wish you and your husband and your children and your in laws all the best xx", "Nta. going NC with your mother and brother sound like a good idea to me.", "NTA.  You're being a good parent. Keep it up.", "Nta\n\nShe sounds horrible.\nYou protected your kids. Good for you.", "NTA: love how everyone accepted the boys and that the transition seems to have been seamless. I also love how you and your husband\u2019s parenting is working out in regards to chores and privacy, I personally not too sure about the lock and key if Mutual respect to privacy is adhered to but that\u2019s just me, what really got me was that she called your sons filthy gold diggers \ud83d\ude33 glad you kicked her out personally she deserved way more than that, I only hope your sons weren\u2019t there during this exchange, she is a real pice of work. I hope she never darkens your doorstep again. I would go NC with mother and brother.", "I suggest blocking the brother as well. And any one else who think you were wrong to protect your children from her vitriol", "> immediately kicked her out. I pushed her out of my house and closed the door, before I packed her stuff and threw it to her feet.\n\nYAASSSSS QUEEN", "NTA she\u2019s a narcissist and you\u2019re better off without her. Cut her off and count your blessing. Your life where you are sounds lovely n it\u2019s thanks to all the choices you have made and the work you have done. She\u2019s never been anything but a source of negativity in your life and you\u2019re better off without her. If your brother cannot see how she is maybe you\u2019re better off without him as well.", "Absolutely NTA. Your mother is a toxic narcissist. You are lucky to have survived. Cut all ties. You'll be glad you did. .", "NTA\n\nYou sound like a great parent, trust your instincts. \n\"trying to help\" has never in history involved opening locked doors or moving furniture around without being asked.", "Sounds like you handled her very well.

You're definitely NTA", "If your family, brother/dad/extended family, don't know the details, I would tell them right away what she said. I garuntee she lied, and the sooner you find out who you can trust your children with, the better.", "NTA\nI read this and immediately blurted out \" she said WHAT!\". I double checked the ages multiple times and just kept looking for something to make it make sense. I'm glad she lives far away.", "Nta tell brother that it stops being help when you tell her to stop and she ignored you", "NTA. Good for you for standing up for your boys & kicking your wretched mom out. And seriously? Gold diggers?! These are children she is insulting. How could young children possibly be considered gold diggers? I would be NC with this shrew. With all of her negativity you are better off keeping her far away from you & your family.", "**Fucked around and** suddenly **found** herself **out**side -NTA", "NTA You are the kind of parent every child dreams of \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc", "NTA - and I would have likely said a lot worse after she called your adopted sons \"gold-diggers.\"", "She called your children gold diggers? Is she out of her mind?\n\nI bet your brother doesn't know the whole story and if he does block him too\n\nThis person cannot be allowed to be anywhere near your children", "NTA good for you.", "NTA. you are not obligated to put up with her disrespectful and clearly bigoted behavior.", "I'm a transracial adoptee and wish I was baffled why others say she was just concerned or trying to help, but this is common. The sheer amount of people who make snide remarks to and about adoptees like \"You should be grateful cuz you could be dead...They've given what no one would, I certainly would never\" etc etc. Little and big things that tear down your sense of worth, self, and place in your new family. Thanks for keeping them safe and cut off anyone else who thinks that was okay!", "She called children golddiggers. Any family member who defends that would no longer be part of my life. Period.\n\nObviously NTA and thank you for giving those children such a wonderful home and being awesome parents.", "I'm confused as to her seeing them as gold diggers, but is upset over them having chores?", "As a former foster kid, I know it\u2019s different as you adopted these boys, but thank you for valuing their privacy\n\nNTA you sound like a wonderful mother", "NTA. She can go be a hag in her own home.", "NTA, good riddance to that woman.", "Yeah, no doubt.  Hopefully she lacks the resources to try and contact OP.", "Seriously tho, that shiny spine is something to be admired. NTA, and I admire the hell out of you. \n\n\nNow I\u2019m staring at my 6 year old son, who just manipulated my husband in to letting him play Switch before bed, and singing \u201cGolddigger\u201d by Kanye in my head\u2026 my kids are TOTALLY gold diggers, man\u2026 they clearly only stick around because we keep buying them stuff\u2026 like clothes, food\u2026 toys.

Your brother can deal with her for the rest of her sad little life.", ">She said that as long as she is my mother and these filthy gold diggers try to live in my home she has every right to make sure they're are not stealing and using me and my husband just because we adopted them.\n\n5, 8 and 11.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Good riddance.", "You\u2019re an amazing mother! You should feel proud of yourself, it\u2019s hard to confront someone like that but you did everything right", "NTA - I'd ask if your mother was suffering from some major neuro or brain issues, but from what you say, she's always been like this.  That makes your excellent life and family a real miracle because it's not easy to become a good person when raised by something like this. You've already done what needs to be done and that door needs to stay closed.  I really don't think there's any chance at all that your mother will ever become an actual person worth having any contact with.  Sad, but you have a great family now and I wish you and them all the best in life.", "NTA\n But I don't know if it's a good idea to let children that young lock their doors. A five year old shouldnt be locking their door. They're too young to need that kind of privacy.", "NTA and exactly what you should have done in the situation! Good job.", "NTA. She shows you no respect. I hope you go NC for your sake and for your sons sakes. They shouldn\u2019t have to deal with being around her.", "NTA\n\nShe surely told a very different story of what went down tho.", "Yeah what an awful thing to say about children.", "Same thoughts! No one decent says stuff like this about someone's children, adoptive or not, unless...", "And your brother's number. He is not a neutral voice. He will always side with his biggest cheerleader without giving a thought to whether she is right or wrong"]}
