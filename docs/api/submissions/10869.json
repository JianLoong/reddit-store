She Always told me that I'm not good enough While she treated my younger brother like a golden child. So I moved to my dad and my (step)mom and my (half)siblings. \nI build up a good life for me and make my money with an online business and good investments. My mom and dad are very proud of me for that, but my mother still thinks I should go back to school/University. \nOne of my investments was a nice house in another country. \nI moved there and I couldn't be happier cause that's where I met my now husband 37/m. His parents are my neighbors. They're amazing and actually introduced us to each other cause we both love photography. \nMy In-laws and my family get really good along, Except from my mother. She thinks I should have married someone from my own country and that I should move back there cause it's hard for her to visit us a couple times a year. \nWell, my husband and I always knew that we wanted to adopt and 3 years ago we were able to welcome 3 boys into our home. They're 5, 8 and 11 and brothers. \nBoth our familys took them in as they had been always been there and they even spend two weeks in the summer at my parents house. \nWhen my mother came to visit us for a week she couldn't stop telling them what to do and what not. For example all of them have a part of chores even if it is just helping with setting up the table or feeding the cats. \nShe made a lot of comments about the parents should do all that stuff. She even tried to get into my son's rooms to clean them up or move the furniture around. \nMy husband and I think that their rooms are their responsibility and we don't enter them without permission. And we only help them cleaning up if they asked for it. They keep clean most of the time Anyway. And they have locks and keys for their doors cause we think privacy is a big deal. \nWhen I saw trying to go while my boss where at school I told that it is against the rules and hurts their trust. She brushed me off but I caught her again a couple hours later. \nThat's when I asked her, why she can't respect my rules in my house and my way of parenting. \nShe said that as long as she is my mother and these filthy gold diggers try to live in my home she has every right to make sure they're are not stealing and using me and my husband just because we adopted them. \nI immediately kicked her out. I pushed her out of my house and closed the door, before I packed her stuff and threw it to her feet. \nI blocked her number and told her if shes not getting of my property I would call the cops. \n\nShe got a flight back home and is trying to blow up my phone, my husbands and the ones of my In-Laws. She even tried to get my dad to speak to me. And my brother is telling me I am an Ungrateful asshole for doing something like this tk my own mother who only tried to help. \nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1677331336, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11bkw05/aita_for_kicking_out_my_mother_like_that/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mother continuously demonstrates to you that she doesn't respect you or your family.  I'm curious to know the significance of having three \"adopted\" children.  Are you suggesting that they are receiving different treatment by your mother because they aren't bio-children? \n\nIt's refreshing to see parents set STRONG boundaries to protect their children and families.

Good luck for a bright future.", "NTA. i\u2019m assuming given the flight tickets that she wasn\u2019t being forced to sleep on the street. on principle, you\u2019re right to draw your own boundaries and enforce them when your mother repeatedly oversteps them. \nspecifically, her view of your kids is deplorable. you don\u2019t want that kind of poison in your life and around your family. \nhow is your other family besides your brother handling all the events? make sure your version of events is made known to those you care about. also might want to talk to your kids about what happened and why you did what you did. i think they\u2019d appreciate it.", "Absolutely NTA. If she can\u2019t respect you as a parent, as the owner of your home, as an adult or what choices you make, then she doesn\u2019t need to be in your home.

They are children who now have a stable living home!! It\u2019s all about control and doing things how she has/would do them. You\u2019re own person with your own boundaries and she\u2019s completely disrespectful and rude. She deserved it.", "You have every right to make her leave. It is your house and if she does not respect your rules and way of parenting she had no right to stay there.

She sounds horrible. Good for you for protecting your boundaries and the boundaries of your sons.", "NTA.\n\nSo, let's sum up:\n\n* Your mom doesn't respect the fact you married someone from another country (aka she's racist).\n* She abused you as a child while your brother was the golden child of the family. And yes, even telling you're not good enough is bad. And if I had to guess, even worse stuff was going on under the surface.\n* She doesn't respect your completely reasonable parenting style. And, finally, the worst thing of them all:\n* She called your children fucking gold diggers.\n\nHonestly, to me it sounds like you did the right thing by blocking her.
