She Always told me that I'm not good enough While she treated my younger brother like a golden child. So I moved to my dad and my (step)mom and my (half)siblings. \nI build up a good life for me and make my money with an online business and good investments. My mom and dad are very proud of me for that, but my mother still thinks I should go back to school/University. \nOne of my investments was a nice house in another country. \nI moved there and I couldn't be happier cause that's where I met my now husband 37/m. His parents are my neighbors. They're amazing and actually introduced us to each other cause we both love photography. \nMy In-laws and my family get really good along, Except from my mother. She thinks I should have married someone from my own country and that I should move back there cause it's hard for her to visit us a couple times a year. \nWell, my husband and I always knew that we wanted to adopt and 3 years ago we were able to welcome 3 boys into our home. They're 5, 8 and 11 and brothers. \nBoth our familys took them in as they had been always been there and they even spend two weeks in the summer at my parents house. \nWhen my mother came to visit us for a week she couldn't stop telling them what to do and what not. For example all of them have a part of chores even if it is just helping with setting up the table or feeding the cats. \nShe made a lot of comments about the parents should do all that stuff. She even tried to get into my son's rooms to clean them up or move the furniture around. \nMy husband and I think that their rooms are their responsibility and we don't enter them without permission. And we only help them cleaning up if they asked for it. They keep clean most of the time Anyway. And they have locks and keys for their doors cause we think privacy is a big deal. \nWhen I saw trying to go while my boss where at school I told that it is against the rules and hurts their trust. She brushed me off but I caught her again a couple hours later. \nThat's when I asked her, why she can't respect my rules in my house and my way of parenting. \nShe said that as long as she is my mother and these filthy gold diggers try to live in my home she has every right to make sure they're are not stealing and using me and my husband just because we adopted them. \nI immediately kicked her out. I pushed her out of my house and closed the door, before I packed her stuff and threw it to her feet. \nI blocked her number and told her if shes not getting of my property I would call the cops. \n\nShe got a flight back home and is trying to blow up my phone, my husbands and the ones of my In-Laws. She even tried to get my dad to speak to me. And my brother is telling me I am an Ungrateful asshole for doing something like this tk my own mother who only tried to help. \nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1677331336, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11bkw05/aita_for_kicking_out_my_mother_like_that/", "score": 269, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are raising them in the ways you and your husband see fit and loving. Your mom has no say in that. Period!\n\nShe came to your home as a guest, not as a boss. She definitely overstepped the bounds. Let me guess, when you grew up you probably heard \"my house, my rules\" on a regular basis. This time it was your house, your rules and she did not respect them. Where the heck did she ever get the idea that a house is ruled by the most senior parent? So, she was your parent once upon a time, ok, fine and dandy. She cannot forever become your parent whenever you are in each other's company.\n\nAs a guest she became intolerable and disrespectful towards you, your family, and your home. These are three very good reasons and you had every right to kick her out. She is pissed because she has now fully realised that she has no more control over you. Bravo to you! But remember she may also have been raised in an environment with majorly overbearing parents and she learnt her parenting from them. For that you can cut her a little slack, but still keep a tight hold on the reins. If she does ever visit, pack her off to a hotel and only ever meet in public places where you can have a quick way to cut the visit short until she learns to behave.\n\nFor your brother to be defending your mom's behaviour tells me that he is still under her thumb and doesn't feel the need to break from it. Golden children tend to keep on the parent's side. And don't... can't see anything wrong with their parent/child dynamic. Often the one who breaks free like you as overeacting and exaggerating. As a middle child I have encountered similar dynamic from me who broke free and my eldest sister who was the golden child.\n\nStay strong!", "NTA.  Block her and brother", "NTA.
