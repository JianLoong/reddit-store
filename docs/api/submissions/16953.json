It's only been a thing since 2018 and it was off for 2020/2021 and resumed last year. This year I (17m) am graduating and I wanted the dinner to be me and just my parents. My dad has been married to my stepmom since I was 9. But to me she's not so much my parent as my dad's wife. But dad didn't want to go with just mom and he asked me to give his ticket to my stepmom. I told him no. That it would just be me and mom then. My stepmom was upset and said she'd go with just mom if she could have me in the middle. Dad said it was a good compromise and I could have both my moms present. I told him I only have one mom. He told me my siblings (16f and 14m) have two moms and that they will copy what I do with this and letting her come will mean they will let her come. I said no.\n\nThey decided to try and sit me down and convince me to give my stepmom the second ticket. I told them when dad said no I already told my school to cut it down to one for me. They asked why. I said because I wanted my parents there, the people who have been there since the beginning and who I love, but dad didn't love me enough to show up. Dad told me I was being unfair. I told him it's true though. That he wouldn't go without his wife and made a point of saying it bothered him that he would be there with just mom and me. He told me they're ex's for a reason. I said yes. But that them being ex's doesn't change that they are my parents, and my siblings parents, and that I did not ask him to pretend to be married to my mom. That I just wanted my actual parents for the graduates dinner with their parents. He told me mom still hates him and I asked him if he was surprised by that given he left us in financial ruin at the end of their marriage. My stepmom asked how I know that and started saying my mom was shitty for filling her kids heads with that. I told her that her husband was the one who got drunk and told his young kids during a breakdown he had when he realized everything had fallen apart in his life. She asked why I wanted my dad there if he was such a bad person. I told her I honestly had no idea anymore. Clearly I was dumb for thinking he would show up for me and was dumb for thinking he'd really changed.\n\nThey said that was more reason for having stepmom there. I said that since dad won't come, it would just be me and my mom and that was for the best.

Just go with you Mom and tell your Dad to pound sand.", "Well it looks like you taught your dad and your step mother a lesson.", "Your stepmom is also TA as she should have told your father, no I'm not going, and you should as you are his father.  My stepmom actually gave up her ticket for my grandmom because I was so close to her and the only sibling to graduate.  I didn't even ask or suggest, she did it because she loves me and knew how important that day is. You're NTA!", "I'm gonna give you an even better advice, take your step mother and your mother and leave your shitty dad. He is the major AH here and honestly apart from jokes don't take him, best to be with the person who actually loves you. NTA", "I'm not expecting him to be around that long.", "Okay so like what did you want OP to do then though? Give up her mom\u2019s ticket so her grown ass dad would stop throwing a tantrum. Or let her stepmother go in place of him because he was no regard for the wants of his literal child who just wanted him to show up for support?", "I am not asking for them to get together again. Just to show up for an important milestone in my life. My dad has zero rights to hate my mom. Mom has every right to hate him. Yet she's the one willing to go at the same time as him, because she actually loves and gives a shit about me.", "My mom is the best. She's had to deal with too much and blames herself too much.", "Their arguments make no sense. I think it was a power play.  they wanted Op and/or OP\u2019s mother to be upset for some reason. \n\nThere\u2019s was zero reason to send step mom of dad didn\u2019t want to go, unless it was some kind of power play.", "I like to call them \u201cBanger-Moms\u201d. \nMy dad had one. She was nine months younger than me, and they were married for 16 years. Our relationship never recovered.", "Op asked for a judgement, not my personal advice. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\nI would have them do what they want to do. They are the ones that have to live with it.", "Honestly, you have no business saying that. You don\u2019t know what OP has been through.\nYou don\u2019t know what the life experiences were that enables OP to fully articulate feelings, emotions and PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS"]}
