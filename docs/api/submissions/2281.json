The first thing she asked when I mentioned that he's trans is \"so he was a woman before?\" I responded that he was assigned female at birth.  Then she asked when he started transitioning, and I told her he transitioned in high school.  Then she asked if he has a penis.  I responded that's a really personal question that I wasn't going to answer.  It wasn't an aggressive response at all, but there's no way I'm about to tell her what's in his pants because like I said... that's really personal.

You protected your friends privacy, well done. Also, I think maybe your sister is uncomfortable with trans people?", "NTA. \n\nThere is this great show on ABC here in Australia (ABC iView - not sure if you can see it elsewhere) called 'You Can't Ask That'.  Each episode focusses on a certain group of people, who get asked all the questions that people have but are too embarrassed to ask or feel they might be insulting the person - its brilliant - the people on there are willing to answer and explain - there is an episode featuring trans people if your sister is curious about it.  \n\nShe shouldn't be asking you, and she should take no for an answer.", "Absolutely NTA. That was an inappropriate question from her no matter who the individual is.", "NTA it is absolutely none of her business and you even told her nicely.", "NTA-trans men/women are constantly dealing with invasive questions, and it\u2019s good that you shut that conversation with your sister down.", "NTA\n\nThe \u201cit\u2019s a valid question\u201d and \u201cgeez I\u2019m just curious\u201d bs is just that - bs.", "\"Does he have a dick?\" \"I don't know, but I have one on the line, asking about it.\"\n\nNTA.", "NTA \n\nYour friend's genitals are not your sister's (or anyone's) business.", "Wow. Definitely NTA\nFor anyone in general, that's not something that you discuss, but for those that are transitioning, that is definitely not something that you ask. It can bring out body issues that they dont need. \nYour friends genitals are their business and theirs alone. If they would like to discuss that with someone that they trust, that's again their business, and I would hope that the person that they choose to discuss it with keeps it to themselves. Sadly, there are a lot of haters out there who would react badly with that information. \nI understand that your sister is curious. However, you handled that perfectly in letting her know that that is not something needing to be discussed.", "NTA.  I completely agree that\u2019s personal and not her concern. Good for you for protecting your friend. Hopefully though it was just inadvisable curiosity and not any sort of trans bias.  If so, hopefully you can smooth things over with her and explain why that might be an offensive question.", "NTA. If she wouldn't ask him that question, why does she think it's okay to ask you?", "NTA - good grief!", "NTA it\u2019s not a valid question at all.", "NTA, you handled that perfectly.

As a trans man i like to answer with the dumbest possible answers until they clue into how inappropriate their question is. I dont know why but I find this works the best out of most other things ive tried. I also sometimes suggest they google it. \n\nIf i know them a little more and they dont really understand what trans is or what the basic edicate is I'll give them a quick run down. \n\nI think you did well and your sister sounds like she knew she was being rude but put her curiosity before respecting a person.", "NTA It's none of her business. Why can't people just accept others for who they are and keep their dumbass thoughts out of what is under clothes or in bedrooms?", "SO NTA. You are in the right here.", "NTA for not answering the question, which as you told he is too intrusive. It probably wasn\u2019t a great idea to tell her your friend is trans in the first place, even though he isn\u2019t secretive about it.

I had a ftm \"bar buddy\" that I asked questions to out of genuine curiosity in an attempt to fight ignorance and build a genuine understanding, but I had built a repore with him and he knew my questions weren't out of malicious intent but genuine understanding.  If she wants to educate herself then she should non-judgmentally \"go to the source\" or a \"source\" that can handle her genuine \"ignorance\" (ignorance is just a lack of knowledge, not bigotry, you can be ignorant of sushi and want to know more but not be an ass).
