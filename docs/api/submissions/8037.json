Sometimes, you have to be hard.", "NTA. He honestly had it coming. They outright rejected their daughter, and asking her to postpone her wedding is awful. They could keep saying they can't get past this \"mental block\" and never actually agree to a date. Your son is still a child, so it is absolutely the correct thing to demonstrate by your words and actions that you accept and love him. They had that chance when your niece was a child and they threw it away. They can try to repair things now that she's an adult, but they can never undo what they did.", "NTA.  \n\nYou were a bit harsh there.  But nothing you said is untrue.  \n\nHe's pissed because he got called out.  And because now he has a choice- get over his stupid religious bullshit right quick, or miss the only chance he'll have to walk his daughter down the aisle.  \n\nHopefully he smartens up.", "NTA Your brother and his wife are responsible for their relationship with their daughter.

Your wife is right that you could've handled it better, but your brother could've as well.\n\nAn E-S-H could technically be issued here because nobody is acting like the best version of themselves, but you being snide to your brother is nowhere near as assholish as him trying to hit the snooze button on his own kid's same-sex wedding.\n\nIf you care about preserving the relationship with your brother, then you should be more diplomatic in how you _talk_ to him.

Just because they are seeing a therapist to work their issues doesn't make their relationship less important. \n\nAlso, that comment could very well turn your brother away from the idea of therapy. It reads as you bashing therapy honestly. It sucks that it is needed. It sucks that he still can't accept his daughter fully. But don't you think encouraging the thing that is allowing him to build this relationship back up is more important than getting the last word? \n\nAlso, his daughter might not like what you said either. A relationship is 2 ways. Not just one. If your brothers relationship with his daughter is less important than your relationship with your son...then his daughters side of that relationship is also less important. \n\nPlease don't take me listing out the reason for you being an AH as me saying you are more of one. Your brother is a massive AH and it is so obvious why that it is that I don't think it needs to be spelled out. \n\nAlso, thank you for taking your niece under her wing and showing her you love her.

Best of luck OP!", "NTA, could you have said it a little better, sure, but hindsight is 50/50 so oh well. They knew their daughter was gay and had plenty of time to adjust. I am a Christian who has family members who are also LGBT. Because of my faith I love and respect people for who they are. Jesus taught us to love everyone as he does, and for those who say it\u2019s a sin, well those without sin can cast the first stone ok. \nYou did the right thing for your son and your niece. I am sure she has gone through so much heart ache with her parents since coming out. I\u2019m glad you were there as a support system.", "ESH, mostly your brother but your last comment is cold hearted and rubs salt in wounds that while self inflicted still hurt.  Some of the extreme religions become cult like and he got sucked in fairly young and meld able.  You need to treat it like addiction, firmly (walk her down the aisle if he can\u2019t get over himself) but respectfully (not throw his attempting to fix his brainwashing in his face)\n\nI must say you sound like a great father and uncle and you\u2019re amazing for showing your niece support.", "ESH. Yes, your brother and SIL are morons for their attitude, but that doesn't mean that their relationship with their daughter is any less valid than your relationship with your son. Kudos for being supportive of both kids, but let brother and SIL come to their own understanding of their daughter and her future wife. If they don't attend the wedding, feel free to walk her down the aisle. If they do come, that's his job unless he decides he can't or doesn't want to.", "I'm going to say ESH here, bigtime for the parents who want to make the timing of their daughter's wedding about their prejudices, but soft ESH for you because you seem to be using her in a rivalry with your brother.\n\nThe right thing to do was to tell your daughter that of course she should set her own date, you didn't have to also offer to walk her down the aisle.  Maybe that would have been ok, but then when he came over and said you were undermining him (which you were), you could have pointed out that she's set a date, and he should tell her he will give her away on that date.  And then your last comment was the icing on the cake.  Yeah, you absolutely could have handled that better.", "~~I think ESH~~ (Check edit). Allowing the wedding to be moved back so she gets to be given away by her father isn't exactly taking a homophobic side. Your niece would also benefit from knowing that her parents accept her by being there and that by the end of it, there won't be any weird tension. \n\nAt the same time, I think your brother had it coming with his question which I feel was a bit leading. This is however giving them the benefit of the doubt and assuming that they're actually sincerely and properly taking the steps to accept that their daughter is gay.\n\nEdit: It's been 8 years I'm now realizing after a reread. NTA, lmao.", "I agree with your feelings about this, but yes,  you crossed a line  by saying it the way you did. Relationships don't have a chance of being repaired unless you all start listening to each other and trying to understand.  Your brother is definitely a bigger asshole in my view, but ESH.

I held their wedding here in our home and love both of them dearly.\n\nI'm also an Evangelical Christian, I drink the kool-aid.  I try to love people as I believe Christ commanded us to. To love them as he did & does.  And how your brother treated his daughter was not Christ-like.  I'm so sorry she had to go through that and I'm so grateful she had you & your parents to love her.\n\nI understand what you were trying to say to your brother.  You were trying to say you believe your relationship with your son is more important to you than his relationship with his daughter is to him.  He of course took it to mean overall.  He looks for offense.  I know many people both Christian and non Christian who do that.  I believe they think if they can find something to be offended by then it excuses their own behavior.\n\nYou were absolutely right to tell your niece you would give her away. She needs to be reminded their are family members who love her dearly with no conditions.  And honestly your brother has already had 8 years to accept his daughter's choices.  Six months isn't going to change anything except to try and stop the wedding. But perhaps that's my bias. My daughter in law came out at 18 when she left home & went to college. My family already knew & had known for two years. Her parents have never accepted her life choice. They removed all financial & emotional resources from her and because she was my daughter's best friend and so very dear to our family we became her substitute family.  My daughter, we thought, was straight but she is bi. She married a young man she was deeply in love with and we lost him in that damnable war.  After many years as a widow she fell in love with her best friend.  They married in 2022.   Her parents did attend the wedding (Reddit helped me with her parents) but the change we thought they had didn't last and they've now rejected her again.\n\nThey claim it's their faith but I know God's love & he would never condone treating a child thus.\n\nI suggest you write your brother & say you both misunderstood each other. That you want him to reconcile with his daughter & be there with her but if he chooses not to, you will fill in for him.   I find writing sometimes gives us the opportunity to rewrite until over emotions are out of our words.\n\nI wish we could all see the meme! That's truly an honor from your son.\n\nI hope the very best for all of you.    Please tell your niece there's an old woman in Texas praying her wedding will be everything they dream of & their marriage will be filled with joy & love.", "\"My wife tells me I could \"probably have handled that better.\"\"\n\nThis made me lol.

I\u2019m just gonna say it. ESH.\n\nYou wrote in your own post that your niece wants her parents at the wedding. Despite her parents essentially disowning her for several years, if she wants them to walk her down the isle, i think thats whats of utmost importance here\n\nYes - You sheltered her, you loved her, you basically were her father for a couple of years. You kept her going. But maybe the time has come for you to take a step back. It feels thankless. \n\nLet\u2019s be real here. This was not about standing up for your son. Your son already knows you love him and support the LGBTQ community. You\u2019re already a superhero in his eyes; nothing you could have said or done would have changed his perception of you. \n\nHowever; you were angry that she was being let down by your brother again. Maybe instead of swooping in to ease the discomfort left by your brother, you could have done something to facilitate a stronger connection between brother and niece?\n\nAt the end of the day, you\u2019re always going to be the protective papa bear in her life; but this time around, i think maybe its ok to let her feel the confusion and the hurt and wait for her dad to make it in time to pick up the pieces. Let him be the one to save her this time. (Even though he\u2019s f\u2019n stupid)\n\nAnyways, those are my initial thoughts. She is so lucky to have you in her life \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f.

It doesn't mean that he doesn't love her, even if he has a hard time accepting her sexuality. Religion also had led people down the wrong roads.  Jesus says live the person but hate the sin.

It is not for me to dictate when you might be ready but I love my niece and don't want to see her wait any longer for you to reconcile your religion with your daughters well being.

Your brother is in the wrong of course, but it seems like he is working on it, hence the therapy and all that.
