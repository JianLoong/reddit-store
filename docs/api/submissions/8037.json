Sometimes, you have to be hard.", "NTA. He honestly had it coming. They outright rejected their daughter, and asking her to postpone her wedding is awful. They could keep saying they can't get past this \"mental block\" and never actually agree to a date. Your son is still a child, so it is absolutely the correct thing to demonstrate by your words and actions that you accept and love him.

Just because they are seeing a therapist to work their issues doesn't make their relationship less important. \n\nAlso, that comment could very well turn your brother away from the idea of therapy. It reads as you bashing therapy honestly. It sucks that it is needed. It sucks that he still can't accept his daughter fully. But don't you think encouraging the thing that is allowing him to build this relationship back up is more important than getting the last word? \n\nAlso, his daughter might not like what you said either. A relationship is 2 ways. Not just one. If your brothers relationship with his daughter is less important than your relationship with your son...then his daughters side of that relationship is also less important. \n\nPlease don't take me listing out the reason for you being an AH as me saying you are more of one. Your brother is a massive AH and it is so obvious why that it is that I don't think it needs to be spelled out. \n\nAlso, thank you for taking your niece under her wing and showing her you love her.

Best of luck OP!", "NTA, could you have said it a little better, sure, but hindsight is 50/50 so oh well. They knew their daughter was gay and had plenty of time to adjust. I am a Christian who has family members who are also LGBT. Because of my faith I love and respect people for who they are. Jesus taught us to love everyone as he does, and for those who say it\u2019s a sin, well those without sin can cast the first stone ok. \nYou did the right thing for your son and your niece. I am sure she has gone through so much heart ache with her parents since coming out. I\u2019m glad you were there as a support system.", "ESH, mostly your brother but your last comment is cold hearted and rubs salt in wounds that while self inflicted still hurt.  Some of the extreme religions become cult like and he got sucked in fairly young and meld able.  You need to treat it like addiction, firmly (walk her down the aisle if he can\u2019t get over himself) but respectfully (not throw his attempting to fix his brainwashing in his face)\n\nI must say you sound like a great father and uncle and you\u2019re amazing for showing your niece support.", "ESH. Yes, your brother and SIL are morons for their attitude, but that doesn't mean that their relationship with their daughter is any less valid than your relationship with your son. Kudos for being supportive of both kids, but let brother and SIL come to their own understanding of their daughter and her future wife. If they don't attend the wedding, feel free to walk her down the aisle. If they do come, that's his job unless he decides he can't or doesn't want to.", "I'm going to say ESH here, bigtime for the parents who want to make the timing of their daughter's wedding about their prejudices, but soft ESH for you because you seem to be using her in a rivalry with your brother.\n\nThe right thing to do was to tell your daughter that of course she should set her own date, you didn't have to also offer to walk her down the aisle.  Maybe that would have been ok, but then when he came over and said you were undermining him (which you were), you could have pointed out that she's set a date, and he should tell her he will give her away on that date.  And then your last comment was the icing on the cake.  Yeah, you absolutely could have handled that better.", "~~I think ESH~~ (Check edit). Allowing the wedding to be moved back so she gets to be given away by her father isn't exactly taking a homophobic side. Your niece would also benefit from knowing that her parents accept her by being there and that by the end of it, there won't be any weird tension. \n\nAt the same time, I think your brother had it coming with his question which I feel was a bit leading. This is however giving them the benefit of the doubt and assuming that they're actually sincerely and properly taking the steps to accept that their daughter is gay.\n\nEdit: It's been 8 years I'm now realizing after a reread. NTA, lmao.", "I agree with your feelings about this, but yes,  you crossed a line  by saying it the way you did. Relationships don't have a chance of being repaired unless you all start listening to each other and trying to understand.  Your brother is definitely a bigger asshole in my view, but ESH.

I held their wedding here in our home and love both of them dearly.\n\nI'm also an Evangelical Christian, I drink the kool-aid.  I try to love people as I believe Christ commanded us to. To love them as he did & does.  And how your brother treated his daughter was not Christ-like.  I'm so sorry she had to go through that and I'm so grateful she had you & your parents to love her.\n\nI understand what you were trying to say to your brother.  You were trying to say you believe your relationship with your son is more important to you than his relationship with his daughter is to him.  He of course took it to mean overall.  He looks for offense.  I know many people both Christian and non Christian who do that.  I believe they think if they can find something to be offended by then it excuses their own behavior.\n\nYou were absolutely right to tell your niece you would give her away. She needs to be reminded their are family members who love her dearly with no conditions.  And honestly your brother has already had 8 years to accept his daughter's choices.  Six months isn't going to change anything except to try and stop the wedding. But perhaps that's my bias. My daughter in law came out at 18 when she left home & went to college. My family already knew & had known for two years. Her parents have never accepted her life choice. They removed all financial & emotional resources from her and because she was my daughter's best friend and so very dear to our family we became her substitute family.  My daughter, we thought, was straight but she is bi. She married a young man she was deeply in love with and we lost him in that damnable war.  After many years as a widow she fell in love with her best friend.  They married in 2022.   Her parents did attend the wedding (Reddit helped me with her parents) but the change we thought they had didn't last and they've now rejected her again.\n\nThey claim it's their faith but I know God's love & he would never condone treating a child thus.\n\nI suggest you write your brother & say you both misunderstood each other. That you want him to reconcile with his daughter & be there with her but if he chooses not to, you will fill in for him.   I find writing sometimes gives us the opportunity to rewrite until over emotions are out of our words.\n\nI wish we could all see the meme! That's truly an honor from your son.\n\nI hope the very best for all of you.    Please tell your niece there's an old woman in Texas praying her wedding will be everything they dream of & their marriage will be filled with joy & love.", "\"My wife tells me I could \"probably have handled that better.\"\"\n\nThis made me lol.

I\u2019m just gonna say it. ESH.\n\nYou wrote in your own post that your niece wants her parents at the wedding. Despite her parents essentially disowning her for several years, if she wants them to walk her down the isle, i think thats whats of utmost importance here\n\nYes - You sheltered her, you loved her, you basically were her father for a couple of years. You kept her going. But maybe the time has come for you to take a step back. It feels thankless. \n\nLet\u2019s be real here. This was not about standing up for your son. Your son already knows you love him and support the LGBTQ community. You\u2019re already a superhero in his eyes; nothing you could have said or done would have changed his perception of you. \n\nHowever; you were angry that she was being let down by your brother again. Maybe instead of swooping in to ease the discomfort left by your brother, you could have done something to facilitate a stronger connection between brother and niece?\n\nAt the end of the day, you\u2019re always going to be the protective papa bear in her life; but this time around, i think maybe its ok to let her feel the confusion and the hurt and wait for her dad to make it in time to pick up the pieces. Let him be the one to save her this time. (Even though he\u2019s f\u2019n stupid)\n\nAnyways, those are my initial thoughts. She is so lucky to have you in her life \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f.

It doesn't mean that he doesn't love her, even if he has a hard time accepting her sexuality. Religion also had led people down the wrong roads.  Jesus says live the person but hate the sin.

Even now when she is marrying the love of her life you are asking her to make major accomodations for you to postpone her wedding in case, in even more time, you are able to show her the love and acceptance that she deserves. It is not for me to dictate when you might be ready but I love my niece and don't want to see her wait any longer for you to reconcile your religion with your daughters well being. If she gets married and you're not there I would be honored to walk her down the aisle. Whether this happens is your decision.

Your brother is in the wrong of course, but it seems like he is working on it, hence the therapy and all that. Realizing you have an issue and working through that issue are two different things and can take time. \n\nAnd wanting to stick up for your son is a good, but it really has nothing to do with this.

If they haven't pulled their heads out by now, they're just hoping to delay until their daughter gets through \"this phase\", I'll bet. It's not her problem, it's theirs. Making accommodations for religious nuttery is how this world got so screwed up, and it's time we all stopped pretending they deserve consideration. Bigotry and hatred (they try to soften it as \"discomfort\") should be outed and confronted at max volume, not soft-pedaled. Good on you, and I hope she has a wonderful wedding, parents or not.", "NTA. You said what needed to be said. Good on you.", "Nta\n\nAs for his \u201cright\u201d to give her away, he already did when he rejected her. You just happened to pick up the treasure he left in the trash.

I didn't even see you say anything as to your niece's thoughts on pushing the wedding back. Maybe she wouldn't mind? Maybe she is appreciative of the fact that her kool-aid drinking parents are trying to make strides? Instead, you jump in with \"NO FUCKING WAY ARE YOU GOING TO PUSH IT BACK! I\"LL WALK YOU DOWN THE AISLE INSTEAD, FUCK THEM!\" You need an ego-check.\n\nAnd yes, you're also an asshole for saying what you said about your relationship being more important.", "YTA- To support your son you don\u2019t have to be the champion of everyone in this world . He is your own brother . You should not interfere in his relationship with his daughter no matter how bad it is . How would you feel if your brother went behind your back to deal with your son? If he doesn\u2019t accept his daughter then that\u2019s their issue. Let her get married whenever she wants and you may attend as a guest . But to actually egg her on to do it, to spew comments against her dad and to volunteer to walk her down the aisle is a bit too much . You crossed a boundary here. You should have acted as a neutral party. To sum it up - let her decide alone when and how she wants to get married and u attend it as her aunt/uncle. That\u2019s it !", "In terms of comparing relationships...YTA.\n\nThere is absolutely no reason to go there. Your brother has to navigate his life his way. \n\nThat said, you can continue to support your niece by encouraging her to set boundaries, which can include refusing to reschedule the wedding date to accommodate her parents IF THAT IS WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO. It needs to be her decision and not you pushing your expectations of how her parents should behave. Talk to her about it, sure, but stay neutral.", "Right the difference is, OP's brother CHOSE to learn hate as a grown-ass adult. He was not indoctrinated as a child. I have no sympathy for the \"unlearning\" he has to do when he chose to learn it to begin with.", "> she didn't fit the mould in which was suitable for her parents lifestyle \n\nIt's funny how people like that always say they don't approve of the gay \"lifestyle\".  Last I checked, religion was a choice and you're just born gay.  It's not a lifestyle any more than having brown hair is a lifestyle.", "I'm picturing one of those Cheems comparisons with the sad Shiba Inu saying something about homophobic parents and the swole doge saying \"I don't need a therapist to teach me how to love my own fucking kid.\"\n\nPerhaps a Wojak meme with a Chad father saying it.

The brother deserves the harsh treatment and the son and niece deserve to see/hear/know someone gave it to him.  I can agree with what you said and still wonder if the best version of ourselves sometimes goes to war for the right cause.\n\nBravo, /u/ConcernEquivalent744 !", "Right? This whole thing reeks of self-righteousness and it's gross. Like, sure, OP started off doing the right thing by supporting his niece. But the rest of it . . .?  So much self-righteousness and self-congratulation that I felt gross by the end, and I'm part of the LGBTQIA community. \n\nI feel like saying to him, \"Congratulations for never struggling with anything and being perfect, but you don't actually get a prize for that.\" His brother is clearly trying really hard to repair that relationship, to do better, and to SHOW UP for his kid. He doesn't \"need therapy to love his daughter\". If he didn't love her, he wouldn't be struggling so hard with his opposing beliefs in the first place, he'd just disown her and walk away. His struggle is that he DOES love her and he doesn't know how to reconcile that with a belief system he has invested in his entire adult life, right or wrong. And now he's doing the work to fix that because he loves her so much. But like . . . people are not perfect, they're complicated. And OP is being a complete dick about the fact that not everyone's experience of the world is exactly like his. Some people struggle. Including his niece AND his brother. \n\nAnd the worst part is that now that they're starting to rebuild their relationship he actually INTERFERED and made it worse. He could have just stayed TF out of it. This isn't about him and his son. It's about his niece and HER dad. He's definitely TA.", "How dare OP be legitimately upset about bigots acting bigoted at the expense of their children. Your tone policing is the only insufferable behavior I've observed here.", "Honestly sounds like something out of a pivotal scene in a really good TV show.  The kind of response most of us wish we had when we think about an exchange 2 days later in the shower.", "Probably thought she'd join the clergy and bang nuns or have inappropriate mentor\\student relationships with kids like so many other super repressed gay people deeply entwined with the church.

The extended family stood by him, never considered kicking him out, and I grew up knowing him as just another family member.

Describe the meme.\n\nI think it\u2019s the line \u201cbecause I don\u2019t have to see a fucking therapist to teach me how to love my own fucking kid\u201d", "Some people take decades to realise they've made a terrible mistake. Deciding that they shouldn't be allowed to make amends or grow serves no purpose except to ensure that . . . well what? Why would you insist that they not be ALLOWED to do better? Do you WANT them to continue to be homophobic? Eight years, ten years, 20 years . .. however long it took, they're ready NOW to learn better. So let them. Let them be better. We need better people in this world. Their DAUGHTER needs them, and she is willing to reconnect. Why is it OP's place to interfere with that?", "\"Don't rock the boat\" should be remade to \"Just let them have their way.\"  Though my preferred answer is : I won't rock the boat, I'll flip the bitch over.

At least they are willing to acknowledge her wedding as real", "they\u2019ve been attempting to change for 8 years and STILL want their daughter to postpone her life just so they can accept her and stop being bigots", ">Some people take decades to realise they've made a terrible mistake.\n\n>Exactly. We need more empathy and progression away from outdated\n\nThis isn't about empathy. Is OP's daughter just supposed to put her life on hold for potentially \"decades\" for her parents to get over their bigotry?\n\nThis is patently ridiculous. Perhaps OP could have been a bit gentler, but he's absolutely doing the right thing by offering to stand in and support his niece with father of the bride responsibilities so *she* can move forward. She's the most important person here.", "Twin here! And someone who has studied sibling theories and such. \n\nNo two kids experience the same household in the same way. Even twins. Because each kid develops their own relationship with their parents/caregivers, their own relationships with the other kids in the house, their own relationships outside the home. \n\nMy brother, for instance, has fond memories of our paternal grandmother. I don\u2019t. I remember not ever living up to her expectations of being a granddaughter. And being yelled at for things that weren\u2019t my fault. \n\nWhen she died, I was not able to make it to the funeral - absolutely broke grad student, living half a country away. And my parents couldn\u2019t help because Dad was laid off. I told my parents that if it were my maternal grandmother, I\u2019d beg borrow and steal to make it work. (My Dad understood because his relationship with her was just as complicated as mine) I get a text from my brother telling me how awful I am and how I need to apologize to our dad for saying that. To him, she was a sweet woman. For me, there\u2019s trauma there. I would have been there if I could. But I couldn\u2019t get myself there, and my family couldn\u2019t get me there. I have a very different relationship with our Gram (our mom\u2019s mom) - and I\u2019d ask anyone who\u2019d listen for a little help. (Beyond that, things like travel and lodging looked very different\u2026 I would have needed much less help to get to my mom\u2019s mom). \n\nSimilar things happen in the home.

Nowhere in the Bible does it say homosexuality is a sin. God doesn't punish people for things they can't control. That includes any type of attraction, temptation, etc. It's only a sin when you actually choose to commit an action.", "I'm impressed that you were able to break free of it! That's awesome. It can be super hard, and I know that that \"stay on Saturday and come with us to church on Sunday\" thing is a common and devious tactic to get kids and teens involved in your belief system. I do generally feel for vulnerable adults that get super swept up in things, but at the end of the day you are right. Adults have the responsibility to evaluate their beliefs, compare them to the facts, and make reasonable conclusions.\n\nI guess I should add the disclaimer that I know there's a difference between an adult getting into something like this and growing up in it where you're told it's the truth all your life, especially in those formative years of childhood. People can and do still break out like that (I did myself, around 15) but it's harder and I understand it more in that case.", "I agree with you.
