Sometimes, you have to be hard.", "NTA. He honestly had it coming. They outright rejected their daughter, and asking her to postpone her wedding is awful. They could keep saying they can't get past this \"mental block\" and never actually agree to a date. Your son is still a child, so it is absolutely the correct thing to demonstrate by your words and actions that you accept and love him. They had that chance when your niece was a child and they threw it away. They can try to repair things now that she's an adult, but they can never undo what they did.", "NTA.  \n\nYou were a bit harsh there.  But nothing you said is untrue.  \n\nHe's pissed because he got called out.  And because now he has a choice- get over his stupid religious bullshit right quick, or miss the only chance he'll have to walk his daughter down the aisle.  \n\nHopefully he smartens up.", "NTA Your brother and his wife are responsible for their relationship with their daughter.

Just because they are seeing a therapist to work their issues doesn't make their relationship less important. \n\nAlso, that comment could very well turn your brother away from the idea of therapy. It reads as you bashing therapy honestly. It sucks that it is needed. It sucks that he still can't accept his daughter fully. But don't you think encouraging the thing that is allowing him to build this relationship back up is more important than getting the last word? \n\nAlso, his daughter might not like what you said either. A relationship is 2 ways. Not just one. If your brothers relationship with his daughter is less important than your relationship with your son...then his daughters side of that relationship is also less important. \n\nPlease don't take me listing out the reason for you being an AH as me saying you are more of one. Your brother is a massive AH and it is so obvious why that it is that I don't think it needs to be spelled out. \n\nAlso, thank you for taking your niece under her wing and showing her you love her.

Best of luck OP!", "NTA, could you have said it a little better, sure, but hindsight is 50/50 so oh well. They knew their daughter was gay and had plenty of time to adjust. I am a Christian who has family members who are also LGBT. Because of my faith I love and respect people for who they are. Jesus taught us to love everyone as he does, and for those who say it\u2019s a sin, well those without sin can cast the first stone ok. \nYou did the right thing for your son and your niece. I am sure she has gone through so much heart ache with her parents since coming out. I\u2019m glad you were there as a support system.", "ESH, mostly your brother but your last comment is cold hearted and rubs salt in wounds that while self inflicted still hurt.  Some of the extreme religions become cult like and he got sucked in fairly young and meld able.  You need to treat it like addiction, firmly (walk her down the aisle if he can\u2019t get over himself) but respectfully (not throw his attempting to fix his brainwashing in his face)\n\nI must say you sound like a great father and uncle and you\u2019re amazing for showing your niece support.", "ESH. Yes, your brother and SIL are morons for their attitude, but that doesn't mean that their relationship with their daughter is any less valid than your relationship with your son. Kudos for being supportive of both kids, but let brother and SIL come to their own understanding of their daughter and her future wife. If they don't attend the wedding, feel free to walk her down the aisle. If they do come, that's his job unless he decides he can't or doesn't want to.", "I'm going to say ESH here, bigtime for the parents who want to make the timing of their daughter's wedding about their prejudices, but soft ESH for you because you seem to be using her in a rivalry with your brother.\n\nThe right thing to do was to tell your daughter that of course she should set her own date, you didn't have to also offer to walk her down the aisle.  Maybe that would have been ok, but then when he came over and said you were undermining him (which you were), you could have pointed out that she's set a date, and he should tell her he will give her away on that date.  And then your last comment was the icing on the cake.  Yeah, you absolutely could have handled that better.", "~~I think ESH~~ (Check edit). Allowing the wedding to be moved back so she gets to be given away by her father isn't exactly taking a homophobic side. Your niece would also benefit from knowing that her parents accept her by being there and that by the end of it, there won't be any weird tension. \n\nAt the same time, I think your brother had it coming with his question which I feel was a bit leading. This is however giving them the benefit of the doubt and assuming that they're actually sincerely and properly taking the steps to accept that their daughter is gay.\n\nEdit: It's been 8 years I'm now realizing after a reread. NTA, lmao.", "I agree with your feelings about this, but yes,  you crossed a line  by saying it the way you did. Relationships don't have a chance of being repaired unless you all start listening to each other and trying to understand.  Your brother is definitely a bigger asshole in my view, but ESH.

Child grows up and turns into their own person, decides who they love. As long as she is in a healthy relationship, what else does a parent need to come to terms with really? Are you, as a parent, really wanting to monitor bedroom activity for your fully grown child? Hell no. I always tell people that if they are truly against gay sex, then they don't need to have gay sex. If it isn't happening in your own bedroom, then stay out of someone elses.\n\nGood on you for letting your brother know he is being an idiot. I am sorry your family has to go through something like this. Not having family members who are LGBTQ, but having family members who are dumb. Were you the first born? If so, perhaps your brother was oxygen deprived during birth?", "NTA. Not gonna lie - I got a big smile on my face when I read your response to your brother.", "NTA. They have had 8 years to learn to love the child they have.\n\nI doubt there's some magic revelation that's going to come in a few months time. How would they even be able to judge \"ready\"? The wedding should not be moved. Your brother has 6 months to get over himself.", "NTA. Gone are the days when people with bigoted ideals got treated with kid gloves. It has nothing to do with you or your son. Your niece is who she is and either they accept her or they don\u2019t. And yeah, people are complicated, and yeah, not everything is so black-and-white, but ya know what? They\u2019ve had eight fuckin years. The bandaid has all but disintegrated - time to rip the damn thing off.", "NTA\n\nIf their daughter was worth changing for, they would've done so already. \n\nThey're also hypocritical and other words that would get me banned. I'm not Christian, but I was raised in it and studied it extensively.\n\nThey're Christian, so they've read the Parable of The Good Samaritan. It's Luke 10: 25 - 37. Here's the tidbits for what I'm talking about.\n\n25 On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. \u201cTeacher,\u201d he asked, \u201cwhat must I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d\n\n26 \u201cWhat is written in the Law?\u201d he replied. \u201cHow do you read it?\u201d\n\n27 He answered, \u201c\u2018Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind\u2019[a]; and, \u2018Love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019[b]\u201d\n\n28 \u201cYou have answered correctly,\u201d Jesus replied. \u201cDo this and you will live.\u201d\n\n29 But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, \u201cAnd who is my neighbor?\u201d\n\nAnd then the parable ends with\n\n36 \u201cWhich of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?\u201d\n\n37 The expert in the law replied, \u201cThe one who had mercy on him.\u201d\n\nJesus told him, \u201cGo and do likewise.\u201d\n\nThe man was beaten and left for dead. The Priest and the Levite ignored him. It was the Samaritan, a person who had cultural reasons to hate the man, that saved him.\n\nIt boils down to 'Treat others how you wish to be treated'. There is nothing saying a person's children are exempt.\n\nOr what about, 'Let he who never has sinned cast the first stone.'\n\nOr, what about the rhetoric of God having a plan for everyone? If God had a plan, then he made their daughter a lesbian. Her being one is a test of faith that the parents failed, for they're choosing the word of false prophets over those written in the bible.\n\nFalse prophets are warned of in Revelations. They can co-opt the Bible for self gain by manipulating the language or just blatantly lying about it.\n\nI'm not religious. A rock has more devotion then I do. Their  audacity just stunned me into a citation filled rage.\n\nReally, though, shame on them. They claim their daughters sin to hide their own. Have they forgotten that all things are known to the Christian God? \n\nEverybody pays. Everybody faces judgement. They will be found wanting for this.", "NTA.  \n\nAs a queer kid, one who got stuck in the closet for _years_ longer because my dad would rather be iced out from his family than go to a gay wedding, you're making sure your priorities are straight (unlike your kid!).\n\nThey have had _eight goddess-damn years_ to \"come to terms\" with her coming out.  At what point is enough enough?  Ten years?  Twenty?\n\nWhy is it on your niece and her soon-to-be-wife to push things back, rather than for them to do the actual hard work they should have been doing the past eight years?\n\nIt's not a \"mental block\" they need to \"unlearn\", they just justified their hate for a long time.  If this was a religious issue, there wouldn't have been a shotgun wedding.  This isn't rocket science -- if the religion isn't good enough for them to have kept their pants on, it sure as hell isn't good enough to push their own child out for something outside of her control.", "Nta", "You handled this much more gently than I ever could. Your brother and SIL are lost causes imo. \n\nNTA. \n\nAlso, you\u2019re awesome for the support you\u2019ve shown. You\u2019re a better man than your brother ever could be if it\u2019s taken more than 8 years for him to love his own daughter.", "Brother and SIL are going to therapy and they still can't get over themselves enough to attend one of the most important days of his daughter's life. NTA OP. His problem is his own problem and he knows how to fix it.", "NTA. Enough with this \"Oh, be gentle with the homophobes!\" nonsense. \n\nIt's been eight years! Guaranteed, part of their ' mental block' is that at least one of them is still waiting for the 'phase' to pass.\n\nTell your sister that they've had understanding and listening for eight bloody years. Judgement is overdue.", "Fuck no, NTA.\n\n\u201cYou are a grown adult and a parent. It\u2019s your job to provide love and support to your child. It is not your child\u2019s job to accommodate your hateful attitudes towards her. You\u2019ve had years, and it\u2019s time to put up or shut up.\u201d\n\nBut what you said works fine, too :)", "NTA. Also if you and your brother are the same age, and (I'm assuming) the same upbringing how do they have more \"unlearning\" to do? \n\nYour sister is just enabling their behaviour and so is your parents. You listened and understood perfectly what was going on. Also your sister should judge homophobes a little more. They just either don't wanna stir the pot, or are also not wanting your niece to be happy. \n\nYour niece doesn't need to cater her happiness to their \"understanding\". She owes them nothing. \n\nYou are a good uncle and I wanna know the meme.", "NTA. you\u2019d be TA if you didn\u2019t react that way, tbh. as someone who is struggling with the exact thing, just with grandparents instead of parents, i can confidently say you\u2019re doing everything right by that young woman. well done.", "NTA. Your family is making me question them, though...", "NTA. I grew up a queer kid who experienced the type of love you get from parents like that. You told him the truth. \"handling it better\" would involve a level of tact and grace that some one who literally goes to therapy to deal with the hatred thier church teaches them to have towards their own child, which failed so hard they don't go to her wedding, doesn't need. \n\nKeep up the good work of being an awesome dad.", "I say YTA for the comment. Because I am an asshole myself. And if I see hypocritical evangelists, I have no problem hurting their feelings to put them in their place. Just like you did. I don\u2019t judge you for that excellent comeback. But if you want a relationship with a Christian freak, that might not have been the brightest idea\n\nI also think you\u2019re NTA for telling your niece that her parents moving the wedding date is bullshit. Because chances are, they\u2019ll push the date further and further till the marriage doesn\u2019t happen.", "NTA I'm just so excited you used Flavor-Aid as that's the drink that did it all. Not Kool Aid.", "YTA, whatever type of relationship they have right now is between them and they are working towards being better for themselves and their kid, but it does take time because people cant just all of a sudden become magically accepting and discard every bigoted thought on whim. No one can say how long its going to take to get through this \"mental block\" but they are taking steps through an actual therapist to get to a place where they can accept and love each other, but your being an AH and meddling by making unnecessary comments and ridiculing them for needing therapy. Do you also rub salt into the wounds of addicts when they seek help for their problems? Or do you just think your just better then everyone else and need to make that clear to everyone else that doesn't have a relationship like yours? Grow the hell up!", "NTA and I'd love to see this meme.", "NTA", "&#x200B;\n\nNTA\n\nI have a daughter in law, she's married to one of my daughters.  I held their wedding here in our home and love both of them dearly.\n\nI'm also an Evangelical Christian, I drink the kool-aid.  I try to love people as I believe Christ commanded us to. To love them as he did & does.  And how your brother treated his daughter was not Christ-like.  I'm so sorry she had to go through that and I'm so grateful she had you & your parents to love her.\n\nI understand what you were trying to say to your brother.  You were trying to say you believe your relationship with your son is more important to you than his relationship with his daughter is to him.  He of course took it to mean overall.  He looks for offense.  I know many people both Christian and non Christian who do that.  I believe they think if they can find something to be offended by then it excuses their own behavior.\n\nYou were absolutely right to tell your niece you would give her away. She needs to be reminded their are family members who love her dearly with no conditions.  And honestly your brother has already had 8 years to accept his daughter's choices.  Six months isn't going to change anything except to try and stop the wedding. But perhaps that's my bias. My daughter in law came out at 18 when she left home & went to college. My family already knew & had known for two years. Her parents have never accepted her life choice. They removed all financial & emotional resources from her and because she was my daughter's best friend and so very dear to our family we became her substitute family.  My daughter, we thought, was straight but she is bi. She married a young man she was deeply in love with and we lost him in that damnable war.  After many years as a widow she fell in love with her best friend.  They married in 2022.   Her parents did attend the wedding (Reddit helped me with her parents) but the change we thought they had didn't last and they've now rejected her again.\n\nThey claim it's their faith but I know God's love & he would never condone treating a child thus.\n\nI suggest you write your brother & say you both misunderstood each other. That you want him to reconcile with his daughter & be there with her but if he chooses not to, you will fill in for him.   I find writing sometimes gives us the opportunity to rewrite until over emotions are out of our words.\n\nI wish we could all see the meme! That's truly an honor from your son.\n\nI hope the very best for all of you.    Please tell your niece there's an old woman in Texas praying her wedding will be everything they dream of & their marriage will be filled with joy & love.", "\"My wife tells me I could \"probably have handled that better.\"\"\n\nThis made me lol. Sounds like a good dry sense of humour there.\n\nNTA. What you said was was... blunt, but it was the good type of 'brutal honesty'. You summed it up perfectly, tbh.", "Look. I\u2019m just gonna say it. ESH.\n\nYou wrote in your own post that your niece wants her parents at the wedding. Despite her parents essentially disowning her for several years, if she wants them to walk her down the isle, i think thats whats of utmost importance here\n\nYes - You sheltered her, you loved her, you basically were her father for a couple of years. You kept her going. But maybe the time has come for you to take a step back. It feels thankless. \n\nLet\u2019s be real here. This was not about standing up for your son. Your son already knows you love him and support the LGBTQ community. You\u2019re already a superhero in his eyes; nothing you could have said or done would have changed his perception of you. \n\nHowever; you were angry that she was being let down by your brother again. Maybe instead of swooping in to ease the discomfort left by your brother, you could have done something to facilitate a stronger connection between brother and niece?\n\nAt the end of the day, you\u2019re always going to be the protective papa bear in her life; but this time around, i think maybe its ok to let her feel the confusion and the hurt and wait for her dad to make it in time to pick up the pieces. Let him be the one to save her this time. (Even though he\u2019s f\u2019n stupid)\n\nAnyways, those are my initial thoughts. She is so lucky to have you in her life \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f. Her dad will probably continue to stumble and fall and disappoint her, but the kid needs to navigate this journey on her own. If she decides to take you to the wedding instead, that\u2019s great too \u263a\ufe0f. But i think its best we leave the decision with her; She chose to rekindle the relationship, she sounds smart enough to know when to back out too", "Precisely. Epic response, OP. No notes. 10/10 stars. \n\nNTA.", "I love the comeback", "> Here's where I may be the asshole: he asked if I was saying that my relationship with my son is more important than his relationship with his daughter.\n\nI don't even understand why he would ask this as I don't see OP ever answer anything other than yes. After all to OP obviously his relationship to his own child is more important to him than his brother's relationship to his child", "Haha Jesus pu-", "Sure, I agree you could have handled it better. It's probably not fair to say that one relationship is more 'important' than another per say. But I'm mincing words here. Your brother didn't deserve to be handled with grace at that point. You sound like a better person and parent. Your brother sounds like a chud. \n\nErgo NTA.", "Technically I suppose he could have handled it better, but it's not like he was wrong. NTA.", "Wish I could give awards lol exactly where my head went", "No, that's *her* choice to decide who walks her down the aisle.  Not OP's brother's.\n\nOh, it might hurt his feelings if he doesn't get to give his daughter away?  Well, that's a _fraction_ of the absolute hell he put her through, so he can suck all the eggs.", "It does though. \n\nWhen these situations come up and you're this type of person, you have a choice...\n\nTo follow your interpretation of your religion's rules or to love your child; you can't have both.\n\nYou love the false idol of your theology and doctrine, or the very real human being that needs you to love them unflinchingly and unconditionally. \n\nThere are people in my family who are making the same stupid fucking choice OP's brother is, and they are \"less than.\"\n\nI'm not a Christian anymore, in part because of them, but I will say this: if you choose doctrine over human beings, you got the wrong message from Christ.", "I don't see how their position (and the conversion therapy or get out policy that led her to live with my parents) can be seen as anything other than incompatible with love.", "If you threaten your child with conversion therapy -- something that _quadruples_ the risk of suicide in an already risky group, and something that is known for corrective rape, among many other abuses -- yes, you absolutely love them less than you should.", "18 is legally considered an adult.. but honestly the brain is still developing/maturing until 25. So his wife is brainwashed, and he spent 7 of his formative years being brainwashed as well. So yes he does have conditioning to unlearn. But one of the first things you learn in therapy is to take accountability for your choices because the only person who can control you is you. Ops brother is STILL an AH but he was by no means an adult other than legally speaking when he had his daughter with an evangelical Christian woman.", "I agree. Most of the time I don\u2019t advocate for escalation, but frankly I think OP handled this like a fucking champ. I know that the brother and SIL are victims in a way, because it\u2019s how the SIL was raised and the brother got sucked in. But we\u2019re in 2023. If you STILL can\u2019t fathom the idea of two women getting married then that\u2019s your problem. Frankly I think OPs line of \u201cI don\u2019t need to see a therapist to teach me how to love my own kid\u201d is fucking gold", "Your comment was crude and AHish but when it really boils down to it, NTA & the kids are lucky to have you and your wife", "You should include that bit about conversion therapy in the post, honestly, it absolutely demonstrates how _awful_ they've been.  They were going to send her to get, at best, put at higher risk of suicide, because she wasn't what they thought she should be.", "Your brother and his daughter both have been thru really trying times. It doesn't mean that he doesn't love her, even if he has a hard time accepting her sexuality. Religion also had led people down the wrong roads.  Jesus says live the person but hate the sin. Many believers think homosexuality is a sin. Again your sister is right, people need to listen more and judge less. It was just mean to say that he didn't love her. I don't know if your relationship with him will ever get over that.", "A man who abandons his child for 8 years does not have inconditional love for that child.\n\nA man who would willingly submit his child to be psychologically abused and tortured, does not have inconditional love for that child.\n\nOP's brother is a hypocrite who deserves far harsher than OP gave. He may try to excuse his bigottry in religion all he wants, but i sincerely doubt he burned all the poliester in his house (Leviticus 19:19), or that he gave up shellfish (Leviticus 11:9-12), or that he kicks his wife out of the home when she is on her period (Leviticus 11:1 - 15:33) yet he does believe that his daughter is an abonimable sinner in need of conversion (Leviticus 18:22). The man, picks and chooses what to follow based on his convinience, he chose to hurt his daughter, he chose to disown her. He is not worthy of the title of father"]}
