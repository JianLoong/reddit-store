He chose to throw away his relationship with his daughter as she didn't fit the mould in which was suitable for her parents lifestyle and as such he now has to continue to accept the consequences of his actions and if he needs a therapist to teach him how to love his daughter then too bad for him.", "NTA, your response was far too epic, and I'm not even mad about it.  Sometimes, you have to be hard.", "NTA. He honestly had it coming. They outright rejected their daughter, and asking her to postpone her wedding is awful. They could keep saying they can't get past this \"mental block\" and never actually agree to a date. Your son is still a child, so it is absolutely the correct thing to demonstrate by your words and actions that you accept and love him. They had that chance when your niece was a child and they threw it away. They can try to repair things now that she's an adult, but they can never undo what they did.", "NTA.  \n\nYou were a bit harsh there.  But nothing you said is untrue.  \n\nHe's pissed because he got called out.  And because now he has a choice- get over his stupid religious bullshit right quick, or miss the only chance he'll have to walk his daughter down the aisle.  \n\nHopefully he smartens up.", "NTA Your brother and his wife are responsible for their relationship with their daughter.  You\u2019re just trying to be a supportive uncle.", "NTA and I'm dying that your brother has \"more to unlearn\" than you do.

Your wife is right that you could've handled it better, but your brother could've as well.\n\nAn E-S-H could technically be issued here because nobody is acting like the best version of themselves, but you being snide to your brother is nowhere near as assholish as him trying to hit the snooze button on his own kid's same-sex wedding.\n\nIf you care about preserving the relationship with your brother, then you should be more diplomatic in how you _talk_ to him.

Your brother sure is though. And is projecting his faults and insecurities onto you.", "NTA. I have a hard time feeling any sympathy for your brother. It's great they're in therapy and trying to be better, but asking their daughter to postpone her life so they can have more time to adjust, after they have already caused her so much trauma, is a really selfish move. What you said to him was harsh but it doesn't make it any less true.", "You're clearly the more mature one here, and your niece and son are lucky to have you. \n\n The audacity to ask someone to change their date because \"they need time to adjust\" due to ~~religion~~ homophobia, is some seriously selfish BS! \n\n Not their relationship, not their day, not their lives to live.\n\n Walk her down the aisle with your head held high if it come to that, I hope it's a beautiful day for everyone who deserves an invitation. NTA!", "NTA - adults with hangup don't get a pass. You're an awesome man.", "ESH. Your brother more than you, but you know (and your wife knows) that was you said was unnecessary. Just because they are seeing a therapist to work their issues doesn't make their relationship less important. \n\nAlso, that comment could very well turn your brother away from the idea of therapy. It reads as you bashing therapy honestly. It sucks that it is needed. It sucks that he still can't accept his daughter fully. But don't you think encouraging the thing that is allowing him to build this relationship back up is more important than getting the last word? \n\nAlso, his daughter might not like what you said either. A relationship is 2 ways. Not just one. If your brothers relationship with his daughter is less important than your relationship with your son...then his daughters side of that relationship is also less important. \n\nPlease don't take me listing out the reason for you being an AH as me saying you are more of one. Your brother is a massive AH and it is so obvious why that it is that I don't think it needs to be spelled out. \n\nAlso, thank you for taking your niece under her wing and showing her you love her. Let her make her own decision about the aisle. You've offered to walk her, which I thought was super sweet, but definitely don't push it or make her feel bad if she does have her father walk her down. Best of luck OP!", "NTA, could you have said it a little better, sure, but hindsight is 50/50 so oh well. They knew their daughter was gay and had plenty of time to adjust. I am a Christian who has family members who are also LGBT. Because of my faith I love and respect people for who they are. Jesus taught us to love everyone as he does, and for those who say it\u2019s a sin, well those without sin can cast the first stone ok. \nYou did the right thing for your son and your niece. I am sure she has gone through so much heart ache with her parents since coming out. I\u2019m glad you were there as a support system.", "ESH, mostly your brother but your last comment is cold hearted and rubs salt in wounds that while self inflicted still hurt.  Some of the extreme religions become cult like and he got sucked in fairly young and meld able.  You need to treat it like addiction, firmly (walk her down the aisle if he can\u2019t get over himself) but respectfully (not throw his attempting to fix his brainwashing in his face)\n\nI must say you sound like a great father and uncle and you\u2019re amazing for showing your niece support.", "ESH. Yes, your brother and SIL are morons for their attitude, but that doesn't mean that their relationship with their daughter is any less valid than your relationship with your son. Kudos for being supportive of both kids, but let brother and SIL come to their own understanding of their daughter and her future wife. If they don't attend the wedding, feel free to walk her down the aisle. If they do come, that's his job unless he decides he can't or doesn't want to.", "I'm going to say ESH here, bigtime for the parents who want to make the timing of their daughter's wedding about their prejudices, but soft ESH for you because you seem to be using her in a rivalry with your brother.\n\nThe right thing to do was to tell your daughter that of course she should set her own date, you didn't have to also offer to walk her down the aisle.  Maybe that would have been ok, but then when he came over and said you were undermining him (which you were), you could have pointed out that she's set a date, and he should tell her he will give her away on that date.  And then your last comment was the icing on the cake.  Yeah, you absolutely could have handled that better.", "~~I think ESH~~ (Check edit). Allowing the wedding to be moved back so she gets to be given away by her father isn't exactly taking a homophobic side. Your niece would also benefit from knowing that her parents accept her by being there and that by the end of it, there won't be any weird tension. \n\nAt the same time, I think your brother had it coming with his question which I feel was a bit leading. This is however giving them the benefit of the doubt and assuming that they're actually sincerely and properly taking the steps to accept that their daughter is gay.\n\nEdit: It's been 8 years I'm now realizing after a reread. NTA, lmao.", "I agree with your feelings about this, but yes,  you crossed a line  by saying it the way you did. Relationships don't have a chance of being repaired unless you all start listening to each other and trying to understand.  Your brother is definitely a bigger asshole in my view, but ESH.  I think you should listen to your sister.  But I also think that the way you are supporting your niece is fantastic.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
