Sometimes, you have to be hard.", "NTA. He honestly had it coming. They outright rejected their daughter, and asking her to postpone her wedding is awful. They could keep saying they can't get past this \"mental block\" and never actually agree to a date. Your son is still a child, so it is absolutely the correct thing to demonstrate by your words and actions that you accept and love him. They had that chance when your niece was a child and they threw it away. They can try to repair things now that she's an adult, but they can never undo what they did.", "NTA.  \n\nYou were a bit harsh there.  But nothing you said is untrue.  \n\nHe's pissed because he got called out.  And because now he has a choice- get over his stupid religious bullshit right quick, or miss the only chance he'll have to walk his daughter down the aisle.  \n\nHopefully he smartens up.", "NTA Your brother and his wife are responsible for their relationship with their daughter.

Your wife is right that you could've handled it better, but your brother could've as well.\n\nAn E-S-H could technically be issued here because nobody is acting like the best version of themselves, but you being snide to your brother is nowhere near as assholish as him trying to hit the snooze button on his own kid's same-sex wedding.\n\nIf you care about preserving the relationship with your brother, then you should be more diplomatic in how you _talk_ to him.

Just because they are seeing a therapist to work their issues doesn't make their relationship less important. \n\nAlso, that comment could very well turn your brother away from the idea of therapy. It reads as you bashing therapy honestly. It sucks that it is needed. It sucks that he still can't accept his daughter fully. But don't you think encouraging the thing that is allowing him to build this relationship back up is more important than getting the last word? \n\nAlso, his daughter might not like what you said either. A relationship is 2 ways. Not just one. If your brothers relationship with his daughter is less important than your relationship with your son...then his daughters side of that relationship is also less important. \n\nPlease don't take me listing out the reason for you being an AH as me saying you are more of one. Your brother is a massive AH and it is so obvious why that it is that I don't think it needs to be spelled out. \n\nAlso, thank you for taking your niece under her wing and showing her you love her.

Best of luck OP!", "NTA, could you have said it a little better, sure, but hindsight is 50/50 so oh well. They knew their daughter was gay and had plenty of time to adjust. I am a Christian who has family members who are also LGBT. Because of my faith I love and respect people for who they are. Jesus taught us to love everyone as he does, and for those who say it\u2019s a sin, well those without sin can cast the first stone ok. \nYou did the right thing for your son and your niece. I am sure she has gone through so much heart ache with her parents since coming out. I\u2019m glad you were there as a support system.", "ESH, mostly your brother but your last comment is cold hearted and rubs salt in wounds that while self inflicted still hurt.  Some of the extreme religions become cult like and he got sucked in fairly young and meld able.  You need to treat it like addiction, firmly (walk her down the aisle if he can\u2019t get over himself) but respectfully (not throw his attempting to fix his brainwashing in his face)\n\nI must say you sound like a great father and uncle and you\u2019re amazing for showing your niece support.", "ESH. Yes, your brother and SIL are morons for their attitude, but that doesn't mean that their relationship with their daughter is any less valid than your relationship with your son. Kudos for being supportive of both kids, but let brother and SIL come to their own understanding of their daughter and her future wife. If they don't attend the wedding, feel free to walk her down the aisle. If they do come, that's his job unless he decides he can't or doesn't want to.", "I'm going to say ESH here, bigtime for the parents who want to make the timing of their daughter's wedding about their prejudices, but soft ESH for you because you seem to be using her in a rivalry with your brother.\n\nThe right thing to do was to tell your daughter that of course she should set her own date, you didn't have to also offer to walk her down the aisle.  Maybe that would have been ok, but then when he came over and said you were undermining him (which you were), you could have pointed out that she's set a date, and he should tell her he will give her away on that date.  And then your last comment was the icing on the cake.  Yeah, you absolutely could have handled that better.", "~~I think ESH~~ (Check edit). Allowing the wedding to be moved back so she gets to be given away by her father isn't exactly taking a homophobic side. Your niece would also benefit from knowing that her parents accept her by being there and that by the end of it, there won't be any weird tension. \n\nAt the same time, I think your brother had it coming with his question which I feel was a bit leading. This is however giving them the benefit of the doubt and assuming that they're actually sincerely and properly taking the steps to accept that their daughter is gay.\n\nEdit: It's been 8 years I'm now realizing after a reread. NTA, lmao.", "I agree with your feelings about this, but yes,  you crossed a line  by saying it the way you did. Relationships don't have a chance of being repaired unless you all start listening to each other and trying to understand.  Your brother is definitely a bigger asshole in my view, but ESH.

I held their wedding here in our home and love both of them dearly.\n\nI'm also an Evangelical Christian, I drink the kool-aid.  I try to love people as I believe Christ commanded us to. To love them as he did & does.  And how your brother treated his daughter was not Christ-like.  I'm so sorry she had to go through that and I'm so grateful she had you & your parents to love her.\n\nI understand what you were trying to say to your brother.  You were trying to say you believe your relationship with your son is more important to you than his relationship with his daughter is to him.  He of course took it to mean overall.  He looks for offense.  I know many people both Christian and non Christian who do that.  I believe they think if they can find something to be offended by then it excuses their own behavior.\n\nYou were absolutely right to tell your niece you would give her away. She needs to be reminded their are family members who love her dearly with no conditions.  And honestly your brother has already had 8 years to accept his daughter's choices.  Six months isn't going to change anything except to try and stop the wedding. But perhaps that's my bias. My daughter in law came out at 18 when she left home & went to college. My family already knew & had known for two years. Her parents have never accepted her life choice. They removed all financial & emotional resources from her and because she was my daughter's best friend and so very dear to our family we became her substitute family.  My daughter, we thought, was straight but she is bi. She married a young man she was deeply in love with and we lost him in that damnable war.  After many years as a widow she fell in love with her best friend.  They married in 2022.   Her parents did attend the wedding (Reddit helped me with her parents) but the change we thought they had didn't last and they've now rejected her again.\n\nThey claim it's their faith but I know God's love & he would never condone treating a child thus.\n\nI suggest you write your brother & say you both misunderstood each other. That you want him to reconcile with his daughter & be there with her but if he chooses not to, you will fill in for him.   I find writing sometimes gives us the opportunity to rewrite until over emotions are out of our words.\n\nI wish we could all see the meme! That's truly an honor from your son.\n\nI hope the very best for all of you.    Please tell your niece there's an old woman in Texas praying her wedding will be everything they dream of & their marriage will be filled with joy & love.", "\"My wife tells me I could \"probably have handled that better.\"\"\n\nThis made me lol.

I\u2019m just gonna say it. ESH.\n\nYou wrote in your own post that your niece wants her parents at the wedding. Despite her parents essentially disowning her for several years, if she wants them to walk her down the isle, i think thats whats of utmost importance here\n\nYes - You sheltered her, you loved her, you basically were her father for a couple of years. You kept her going. But maybe the time has come for you to take a step back. It feels thankless. \n\nLet\u2019s be real here. This was not about standing up for your son. Your son already knows you love him and support the LGBTQ community. You\u2019re already a superhero in his eyes; nothing you could have said or done would have changed his perception of you. \n\nHowever; you were angry that she was being let down by your brother again. Maybe instead of swooping in to ease the discomfort left by your brother, you could have done something to facilitate a stronger connection between brother and niece?\n\nAt the end of the day, you\u2019re always going to be the protective papa bear in her life; but this time around, i think maybe its ok to let her feel the confusion and the hurt and wait for her dad to make it in time to pick up the pieces. Let him be the one to save her this time. (Even though he\u2019s f\u2019n stupid)\n\nAnyways, those are my initial thoughts. She is so lucky to have you in her life \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f.

It doesn't mean that he doesn't love her, even if he has a hard time accepting her sexuality. Religion also had led people down the wrong roads.  Jesus says live the person but hate the sin.

What are you supposed to be listening to?", "NTA- you seem to stand up for her more than her parents.\n\nHer parents are welcome to believe what they want- but they decide to keep their child, as well as likely decided to keep it when they found out they were pregnant. \n\nWhy is it ok stop supporting their child because they prefer to date women over men. How does that hurt them? They think it\u2019s acceptable to drop their kid because she believes differently- then have the nerve to tell you that your the a-hole for doing a better at their job of supporting their kid-then they are? \n\nI am sorry you have to deal with this- if she isn\u2019t already I could not suggest finding her a therapist to talk to more.", "Yes, you probably could have handled that  interaction with your brother better, but he had it coming, and I'm totally here for it.\n\nYT mildest of AH, and I love your sass.  Your brother's a bigger AH, but he is trying, with the therapy and all.", "absolutely NTA, thank you for being a decent human and great ally :)", "I\u2019m straight but have many gay friends who I love dearly. You\u2019re clearly a wonderful and understanding parent, and an ally. I really hope what you said to your brother resonates and he pulls his head out before he loses his daughter for good. NTA in the slightest.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou did what all parents should do - you lead by example.", "YTA.\n\nYour brother and his wife are making a concerted effort to reconcile their beliefs with their daughter's life.  I and make their family whole again.  I know people don't take religion seriously here on Reddit,  but this is a core belief that they need to unpack and the fact that they are making an effort shows some progress. Also, your niece is willing to work with them to reunite with their family.  This is THEIR journey, respect that.\n\nDid she want you to tell her what to do, or was she searching for an ally to help her process her decision?    She could have very well told her parents no, she would not postpone the wedding, but that would have to be her decision for her reasons.  Instead, you took away that right to process by inserting your opinion and giving her a solution.  Other than being supportive, the rest it none of your business.\n\nYou are obviously the opposite of your brother in regard to beliefs, but just as insufferable in your judgment.", "YTA", "Your wife is right.  Verrry gentle YTA for the comment that your parent/child relationship is more important than his.  Otherwise, you rock and your niece is lucky to have you in her corner.", "NTA and I appreciate your perspective but if your niece wants to give it a chance, she should be able to have the choice. Also you straight up saying that you\u2019ll walk her down the aisle when there\u2019s no info whether it was her suggestion feels icky to me. I know you\u2019re trying to protect your niece (and you\u2019re definitely not the asshole for what you said to your brother) but ultimately she\u2019s an adult and it\u2019s her choice what she\u2019s gonna do about it.", "**NTA** \n\nYour brother is a massive AH. You are a very very gentle AH. Firstly, your niece came out aged 17 and if your brother and his wife are still on their \"journey\" to accepting her and asking her to postpone her wedding they are massive AHs and there is no supporting them. \n\nBeyond this however, offering for you to walk her down the aisle treds a very fine line for me of getting overly involved. For me you're NTA with this. Your brother has had time. You are showing support for your niece and tolerance towards homosexuality. You are showing that you value her, her partner, their lives together as part of your life. \n\nWhere you're probably, gently, the AH is when your brother comes to speak to you. Your response is a personal attack on him and runs the risk of undermining the fact that they are actually attending therapy. You don't owe your brother any understanding but you could have communicated this better. \n\nMaybe something along these lines although this is also far from perfect.\n\n\"I understand that you're upset and I don't think we need to argue which one of us has a more important relationship with their child as this won't be constructive. I am not trying to undermine your relationship with your daughter but you have to understand that she came out when she was 17. This is eight years ago. Through this time you have cleary struggled to show her love and acceptance due to her homosexuality as a concequence of your beliefs. Even now when she is marrying the love of her life you are asking her to make major accomodations for you to postpone her wedding in case, in even more time, you are able to show her the love and acceptance that she deserves. It is not for me to dictate when you might be ready but I love my niece and don't want to see her wait any longer for you to reconcile your religion with your daughters well being. If she gets married and you're not there I would be honored to walk her down the aisle. Whether this happens is your decision. You cannot expect her to wait forever for you and it seems you are now asking me to undermine my relationship with not only her but with my son by validating or giving legitimacy to your homophobia. If this upsets you I am truely sorry but for the sake of my niece, your daughter and my son, your nephew I will never change my stance.\"", "NTA but soft Y T A for saying the therapist line. So many people are already avoidant of therapy let's not do therapy shaming. Even the most well adjusted people can use some help time to time let alone people like your brother.", "THIS", "NTA\n\nOP handled it perfectly. To rephrase your answer: \"I'm not supporting bigoted homophobes\" as \"so x is more important than y\" is a way of arguing that abusive people in the wrong often use to gain some sort of victory. \n\nHe put you in the corner with this ridiculous and extreme 'x vs y' question and you didn't play his game by crawling back and nuancing things.", "what the fuck did they think \"i'm a lesbian\" means if not that she's going to marry another girl?", "Half the stories on AITA could do with this phrase.", "How come he don\u2019t want me, man :(", "It\u2019s completely ridiculous that OP\u2019s brother and his wife would ask their own daughter to postpone her own wedding to accomodate them. \n\nIf they haven\u2019t accepted her yet by this time, then they need to choose whether to be part of her life or not. It\u2019s selfish for them to think their daughter would put her life on hold for them.", "Undermining what relationship? He ostracised his daughter and she got raised by her grandparents.", "The brother *chose* to become a bigot. That doesn't really deserve a lot of politeness in my book.", "THIS \ud83d\udcaf% OP send this to your brother, as an reminder what Bible is actually trying to teach them, obviously, as you're worried they have gone off the path from being a good Christians, petty but deserved", "Exactly i completly agree. Idk why they are downvoting you.\n\nFor some reason people are scared to disagree with posts like this.", "His only freaking job is to abide by his daughters wishes at HER wedding.", "And the longer they take to accept their own daughter, the more chances their daughter may not be willing to wait for them anymore.", "Since OP\u2019s brother needs a professional therapist or even just another person to teach him how to love his own kid, then he has already lost the whole argument that he himself started.", "And honestly, OP's relationship with his niece is clearly more important to OP/taken more seriously by OP, than his brother considers his relationship with his own daughter to be.", "Give us the meme!!!", "per se\n\nI think he meant *his* relationship with his son is more important to him than his brother's with his daughter is, which is totally understandable.", "Fr, why is everyone like \u201coh no how could you say that one horrible thing to him\u201d umm excuse me let\u2019s not ignore the countless horrible things he has said about and to his daughter and oh yeah he literally ostracized her. I think he may deserve one sentence worth of \u201cyou\u2019re a shitty parent dude\u201d. How else will he ever improve", "Ha yes, the good ol' kids gloves for a 43 yo", "Idk,  I feel like OP could have insulted his brother a bit more.", "You hit the nail on the head with that assessment. I wish I had gold to give you.\n\nWhat I don't get is why the parents and other sibling are so concerned about the brother's feelings. Like, they took in a 17-year-old child who felt the need to move away from her parents because being gay was such a horrible thing for them. Why is no one else going to bat for the child they stepped up and took care of, when her own parents needed smelling salts and a couch to cope with her gayness? And if the fiancee is the second niece, why is no one going to bat for her as well? Why is no one saying, \"Why do your beliefs matter more than the safety and well-being of three members of the family?\"\n\nETA: typo fixed and NTA.", "I gotchu", "This is what gets me.  \nMental block for the wife, sure. These bigoted religious communities can do a number on your values, that much we can all agree on. But brother learned to be tolerant from his parents, i.e. in his formative years, and then unlearned it all to the point where he needs to go into therapy in the time it took niece to turn 17? I mean, I get supporting your wife, and wanting to impress your inlaws, but surely *loving your child* is a more important impulse than that?\n\nNTA and brother needs to take a hard look at his values. Hopefully OP woke him up a bit.", "Brother was threatening to send his own daughter to conversion therapy.  At best, it\u2019s a huge suicide risk.  That\u2019s the good outcome.\n\nIf you\u2019re willing to do that to your child, you absolutely do love them less.", "I would call that abuse.

Verbally slap the shit out of the brother and bring him back to 2023 OP!", "You don\u2019t send a person you love and want to protect to conversion therapy.
