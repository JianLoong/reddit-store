Jake has two kids with his ex Ella (11) and Micah (9). They divorced when Micah was 4 months old and his ex passed away 3 years ago, which is when Sam met the kids.\n\nThe kids have not taken to Sam. They are okay with her but in no way do they treat her like she's their parent and they also don't really treat her like a close family member. Sam accepts that the kids set the tone of the relationship and she does her best to encourage a bond between her and them while not forcing it. I think she's really great at walking that line. But my parents have essentially decided she's now the kids' mom and they have the same expectations that they would for someone who had been there since conception.\n\nThis has really come through now that Sam is pregnant. She's scared. She's worried about the delivery and having a newborn and she also worries about the kids and how they will respond to a new (half) sibling. My parents are always telling her she can do it, she has all the experience she needs and she can see how close Ella and Micha are so she shouldn't worry about their reaction to the baby because they will love him or her as much as they love each other. They brought up seeing her comment that this was her first time and they told her that's not true and she already has two kids. The comment was about being pregnant but they seem to want to brush over it.\n\nI saw Sam recently and she was alone so I asked her how she was doing. She admitted she was struggling and she is trying to drown out all the stuff my parents say, but since she doesn't have her own support network (her family put the mess in messy) of family and my parents are around so much, it's hard. She said she doesn't feel like she can be honest that she's a bit lost and feels totally unprepared and worries about her abilities as a mom. She said they are so convinced she's already a mom but while she does all the practical stuff, they don't rely on her for stuff the way the baby most likely will. I comforted her the best I could in that moment.\n\nThen I went and spoke to my parents and told them they need to ease up on Sam and treating her like this isn't her first pregnancy. I told them while yes, she's there and doing a lot of parenting duties for Ella and Micah, they were both in school when she met them and she has never been pregnant. I also pointed out they do not regard her as their mom and the more they push that and insist on that, the more harm they could do to her relationship with the kids. My parents told me it was a terrible mindset to have and blood is not what makes a family and blood does not make a parent. They said they are helping Sam and she will be glad for their advice later down the road because it does no good to dwell on the first pregnancy when she is a mom. They were so offended and told me later that I was making things worse.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699648399, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17sd3kn/aita_for_telling_my_parents_they_should_ease_up/", "score": 808, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Of course it would be lovely if the kids took to Sam as if she were their biological mom and everyone was close and happy and non one died and everyone lived forever.  But the reality is that the children lost their bio mom, whom they are old enough to remember and Sam is in that thankless position of being a guardian to children who are grieving and in a confusing place in the world who want their mom and not Sam and are struggling to adjust emotionally to their new reality.\n\nSam feeling isolated while being surrounded by family is heartbreaking. This *is* new to her. This *is* something she hasn't experienced. There is so much to worry about I feel so sorry that she is once again being put in this thankless position of swallowing up how everyone else feels and her own feelings to keep the peace.\n\nThe big thing is also...where is Jake? Where is Jake in any of this? Your brother really needs to know what is going on and draw a boundary for Sam with his parents that this is a different family dynamic and a different experience and recognizing that it is doesn't mean it's bad. It's just different. But if they ignore what the children are feeling and how their daughter in law is feeling it will turn bad.

Blending families is hard and it sounds you SIL is doing a great job. I\u2019m sure it would be devastating for the kids if their grandparents ruined that for them.

But, having been there, lots of parents do this. They have their own issues and worries, and basically just aren't able to be any sort of emotional support to Sam. The best thing they can do is stay out of the way and don't burden her with their utopian ideas.\n\nFrom Sam's point of view, probably best to just ignore your parents. They are not helpful. There's nothing wrong with her feeling nervous about having her first baby but the best supports will be other moms of young children, and hopefully her husband. It might not be a bad idea for Sam to have some counseling before the baby comes so she can prepare herself regarding how she handles the older children, who are probably still feeling some effects from the loss of their mother. They might be jealous that the baby gets to live with both its parents, if you see what I mean. So counseling for that, even counseling separately for the kids, whatever works. \n\nNo mom is sure of herself before she has the baby, especially for her first child. Nevertheless, evolution kicks in and you figure it out. Also, one of those babycare classes that hospitals run. (get it done well BEFORE the baby comes, once the baby is here it's too late!!!! ) It's also helpful if the dad can be a support and an advocate for his wife: pay attention to doctor's instructions during delivery and postpartum phase, take notes when the neonatologist debriefs them on the baby's status; be willing to do babycare during the nights so the mother can get sleep if possible, be willing to pitch in with housework, cooking, looking after the older kids, so the new mother isn't run ragged doing it all alone. A dad who just makes sure his wife stays hydrated and fed while she's breastfeeding (which is round the clock for the first few months) is worth his weight in gold. \n\nYou sound great and like a great support to Sam", "NTA. Your parents suck.", "NTA your parents are delusional and think they know best.  They disregard Sam's feelings because they know everything.  Your brother needs to step up for his wife and tell them to back off", "nta", "Oh gosh, your parents are so deaf. Good on you for standing up for your SIL. Absolutely NTA.", "NTA. They are going to ruin any chance Sam has of forming a friendship with her step-children. Your brother really needs to tell your parents to back up. Encourage Sam to take a huge step back from your parents. You continue to call them out.", "[removed]", "NTA. Continue to stand in Sam\u2019s corner. She sounds like she\u2019s doing all the right things with her step kids, which is a wonderful thing. Your parents are treating her very unfairly. Forcing a parental relationship will hurt everyone, and dismissing Sam\u2019s first-time pregnancy fears is disingenuous. \n\nWhere is Jake in all this? He should be intervening on his wife\u2019s behalf. Give him a kick in the ass, like a good sibling should.", "NTA keep telling Sam you are in her corner, and speak up in the moment when they say inappropriate things to Sam.  Talk to Jake too, encourage him to listen to Sam and speak up to your parents.  You are right that your parents pushing the \u201cSam is their mom\u201d idea may strain the kids relationship with Sam.  The baby may also bring strain and hurt feelings.  Tell Sam and show her you are listening, understand and in hee side, and that you love her.", "NTA. I'm so glad your SIL has you.", "Are they into positive thinking and vision boards and shit like that? It seems they think they can will things into existence just be being obtuse. NTA", "NTA\n\nThey are not helping Sam. They want to be grandparents to a brood, and this will not accomplish it. Sam needs to cut contact or at the very least, lessen it to a degree that she can manage, without using their 'feelings' as a measure of what she should take.\n\nHas she toured the hospital where she will deliver yet? I don't know if this is still a thing, but my ob-gyn scheduled a visit for me and my former husband, so we could get a look around, meet some of the staff, and help get me in the right mindset. This was pretty common at the time, and they gave me a cute little baby bag when I left, full of samples and coupons :D \n\nThe hospital also often has a schedule for parenting classes. If it has training in infant cpr or other emergencies, it would be worth encouraging her to register. The one I went to was like ONE session, lol and didn't do things like first aid at the time :( \n\nthere are also new parent groups, online and IRL, usually at the hospital or in therapy groups that she might consider researching.\n\n\nIf you are involved, you might help her register at the local stores, like Wallyworld, Publix, Winn-Dixie whatever is near you. They often give samples and TONS of coupons for expecting/new moms, for a year or so. It isn't just for baby stuff, it's often for produce/meat/dairy, things you'd feed your family. \n\nI'm suggesting above, because it sounds like her parents are taking all the joy out of her first baby. This will reinforce what a happy new experience this will be for her, and allow her the novelty they are denying her. It will also help her know that there are resources, and people that will support her, and share her joy.\n\nLastly, encourage your brother and her to take the kids for family therapy. not to encourage the kids to 'bond'. The kids need to understand that just because Sam's parents are trying to force her to fake extreme bonding, that she respects their boundaries, and she will limit their interactions between her parents and them if it makes them uncomfortable. The therapist might be able to help them express their feelings about the new baby, if they have been reticent about talking about it until now. \n\nI think you are great for backing her up, and standing up to her parents, you are a great uncle and bil :D", "NTA.  Your *parents* are making things worse.  They are trying to force a relationship onto their grandkids with their stepmother that *they do not want*.  They are stressing Sam out with their comments, and they seem completely oblivious.  I bet when the kids are older your parents will wonder why they don't see their grandkids as often as they did when they were younger because Ella and Micah are going to refuse to visit.\n\nSam has not experienced the lack of sleep a newborn will bring.  She has not experienced breastfeeding her child, changing a diaper while trying to manage a house with two older kids.\n\n> My parents told me it was a terrible mindset to have and blood is not what makes a family and blood does not make a parent.\n\nRemind them that you *are not* the one with that mindset, Ella and Micah have that mindset.  Then tell them that if they try to \"correct\" that mindset that they will push Ella and Micah away from them.  Tell them that you and Sam are respecting Ella and Micah's choice and that they need to do the same, which means *lay off the \"you're already a parent\" talk with Sam.*\"", "Holy cow. NTA and your BROTHER needs to verbally smack your parents down about this. Either they ease up on his wife or they dont see them as often. Thats how that should work.", "NTA sorry but your parents sound really selfishly delusional if that\u2019s a thing. Disregarding Sam\u2019s and the kids relationship and feelings and insisting that they know best?!?! \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11", "NTA. Your parents are absolutely assholes here.\n\nBlood doesn't make a family, but neither does being shitty overbearing assholes.\n\nPregnancy is its own thing. *Handling a newborn* is totally different from dealing with older kids. Your parents are idiots.", "NTA", "NTA. Have a talk with your brother about your parent's behaviour. He needs to be there for her and stand up to your parents. While I agree with them that you don't have to be related to being considered family, your SIL has a better chance to become closer with her step kids in the future by doing what she's doing now, encouraging and not forcing them to anything. What they're doing is trying to force a relationship, which, if any story  from reddit has taught me, will have the opposite effect. Your brother and his wife need to be a united front, on the one hand, so the kids won't feel like they'll become less of a priority and start resenting the new baby, and on the other against your parent's \"help\" and for her to not feel alone in this.", "NTA.\n\nYou cannot control your parents or anyone else.\nYou cannot ask, expect or force them to see the truth, change, or behave in a way that you think is right.\nIt's a waste of time. \n\nYou CAN make an effort to champion the effort to be your SILs support group.\n\nCheck-in.\nTalk to her.\nAsk her what she needs.\nJust be there.\nShe's doing her best... let her know, often... even if she knows, has heard it 100000 times, let her know she's doing the best she can and she's doing a damn fine job. \nShes in a hard position in many parts of her life.\nIt sounds very lonely, frustrating, and overwhelming.\n\nYour parents make a strike and a miss of a comment? Out of eyesight, Share a reassuring glance, a hand on the shoulder, roll your eyes, anything, a funny face, anything to cut her anxiety, not make her feel pressure, anxiety, or low for a moment. A small release of pressure. She's not crazy, she's not alone. She's not being stupid, dramatic, or anything she shouldn't be.\n\nShe does have family. She has you. That's a start! It's more than you think. (Take it from someone who also has none)\n\nMaybe hook her up with a blended family or first time pregnancy moms support group... somewhere she can share, build community. \n\nHelp her find play groups, baby gyms,(for after the baby)\nSome pregnancy and parenting classes (the hospital likely has them!) Lamaz class, even if she doesn't want or need the technique or knows how to care for an infant, it can help her be around other moms, feel more in control, more informed about what will happen...moreso than from a book,  people who are going through what she is will be all around her. it's worth a shot.\n\nYour parents ideas are not helpful, are entirely outdated. They verge on remarkably purposefully uncaring. Their view is remarkably stupid and show a lot of how they feel about her, her thoughts and feelings. I'm sorry. You should be offended, you did not offend for no reason. You told the truth. You didn't make it worse, you shone a light, made them feel bad, so they doubled down, turned it around and blamed YOU and said that to get you to drop it.\nThey do not want to change. They do not want to see. They do not want to support her. That ship has sailed.", "NTA but your brother needs to step up and run interference asap.", "NTA \n\nSounds like your parents are the ones trying to replace their late ex-DIL \u2014 and that has nothing to do with the kids. They\u2019re projecting their needs onto the children and it isn\u2019t fair.", "NTA. You are being caring and sensitive to the needs of your family while your parents are pushing their own agenda.", "NTA, keep looking out for your SIL sound like she needs it. Your parents are pushing way too hard and minimising her legitimate concerns. If it comes up again maybe point out that not only are you putting strain on her relationship with her step kids but they are doing damage to their relationship with her. Do they want her to feel like she can come to them and rely on them? Because telling her she\u2019s being silly and her feelings are wrong is going to destroy their relationship too", "NTA\n\nGood on you for trying to get your parents to stay in the appropriate lane OP. \n\nSadly it sounds like a serious case of \u2018they know best\u2019 which isn\u2019t at all helpful. \n\nWhat exactly is your brother doing to stand up for his wife in this situation?  Have you spoken with him?  \n\nHas he said anything to your parents about backing off unless they are actually ready to help Sam as the understandably nervous first time mom that she is?   \n\nYes she\u2019s a stepmother but the kids have made it clear she is NOT their mother and Sam honors that decision.  Her in-laws pushing their sunshine and rainbows view could very well alienate the older kids. \n\nI\u2019m also concerned Sam\u2019s in-laws pushing \u2018one big happy family\u2019 could also damage whatever relationship the 2 older kids might try to have with the baby.\n\nIf they are available hopefully Sam is taking some birthing classes and your brother is attending also as things may have changed quite a since his youngest was born 9 years ago.", "NTA\n\n> blood is not what makes a family and blood does not make a parent. \n\nThey also don\u2019t get to decide that for someone else.
