{"id": 30727, "submission_id": "17sd3kn", "title": "AITA for telling my parents they should ease up on treating my SIL like this isn't her first pregnancy?", "selftext": "My brother Jake is married to my SIL Sam. Jake has two kids with his ex Ella (11) and Micah (9). They divorced when Micah was 4 months old and his ex passed away 3 years ago, which is when Sam met the kids.\n\nThe kids have not taken to Sam. They are okay with her but in no way do they treat her like she's their parent and they also don't really treat her like a close family member. Sam accepts that the kids set the tone of the relationship and she does her best to encourage a bond between her and them while not forcing it. I think she's really great at walking that line. But my parents have essentially decided she's now the kids' mom and they have the same expectations that they would for someone who had been there since conception.\n\nThis has really come through now that Sam is pregnant. She's scared. She's worried about the delivery and having a newborn and she also worries about the kids and how they will respond to a new (half) sibling. My parents are always telling her she can do it, she has all the experience she needs and she can see how close Ella and Micha are so she shouldn't worry about their reaction to the baby because they will love him or her as much as they love each other. They brought up seeing her comment that this was her first time and they told her that's not true and she already has two kids. The comment was about being pregnant but they seem to want to brush over it.\n\nI saw Sam recently and she was alone so I asked her how she was doing. She admitted she was struggling and she is trying to drown out all the stuff my parents say, but since she doesn't have her own support network (her family put the mess in messy) of family and my parents are around so much, it's hard. She said she doesn't feel like she can be honest that she's a bit lost and feels totally unprepared and worries about her abilities as a mom. She said they are so convinced she's already a mom but while she does all the practical stuff, they don't rely on her for stuff the way the baby most likely will. I comforted her the best I could in that moment.\n\nThen I went and spoke to my parents and told them they need to ease up on Sam and treating her like this isn't her first pregnancy. I told them while yes, she's there and doing a lot of parenting duties for Ella and Micah, they were both in school when she met them and she has never been pregnant. I also pointed out they do not regard her as their mom and the more they push that and insist on that, the more harm they could do to her relationship with the kids. My parents told me it was a terrible mindset to have and blood is not what makes a family and blood does not make a parent. They said they are helping Sam and she will be glad for their advice later down the road because it does no good to dwell on the first pregnancy when she is a mom. They were so offended and told me later that I was making things worse.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699648399, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17sd3kn/aita_for_telling_my_parents_they_should_ease_up/", "score": 203, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Of course it would be lovely if the kids took to Sam as if she were their biological mom and everyone was close and happy and non one died and everyone lived forever.  But the reality is that the children lost their bio mom, whom they are old enough to remember and Sam is in that thankless position of being a guardian to children who are grieving and in a confusing place in the world who want their mom and not Sam and are struggling to adjust emotionally to their new reality.\n\nSam feeling isolated while being surrounded by family is heartbreaking. This *is* new to her. This *is* something she hasn't experienced. There is so much to worry about I feel so sorry that she is once again being put in this thankless position of swallowing up how everyone else feels and her own feelings to keep the peace.\n\nThe big thing is also...where is Jake? Where is Jake in any of this? Your brother really needs to know what is going on and draw a boundary for Sam with his parents that this is a different family dynamic and a different experience and recognizing that it is doesn't mean it's bad. It's just different. But if they ignore what the children are feeling and how their daughter in law is feeling it will turn bad.

It sounds like your parents are trying to show support for your brother\u2019s blended family, but the support they\u2019re offering isn\u2019t helping. Not everyone is able to be an effective sounding board. Since your parents\u2019 responses to Sam\u2019s concerns about motherhood are making her feel worse, she needs to discuss her concerns with someone else like her husband, a friend, a therapist etc. That doesn\u2019t mean she should exclude your parents\u2019 from other aspect of the baby\u2019s upcoming arrival.

A baby's about to pop out of her body. Anybody not saying helpful things can go shove it.  If you're able and willing, maybe lunch dates with SIL so she can vent about your parents being ridiculous when she needs to?

Pregnancy is not a cake walk and labor scares the hell out of me (I mean, hello, big head, little exit route.)

She is doing her part to respect the fact that they have a mom who is now gone but, despite that, that they will always have that connection.  That is great, but that is the end of her responsibility in that regard.\n\nIt's up to your brother to show/tell his kids that their mom will not be forgotten, that your SIL does not want to take her place, and is instead committed to being a person who loves them and that they can count on.\n\nYour parents need to understand that you can't simply replace the mother of your brother's kids like you can change a light bulb.  And it is on your brother to do that.  \n\nYour SIL is experiencing her first pregnancy, with all the worries that come with such a huge experience.  Instead of supporting her (as a unique person and not a plug-in mom, FFS), your parents are undermining her relationship with her step kids, stressing her out, and not being there for her, as an actual person with thoughts and feelings, as she prepares for this new child.\n\nSo I ask again - where is your brother, and why isn't he taking care of this and supporting his wife?", "NTA but you tried and they aren\u2019t going to change. It is unfortunately no one\u2019s business to confront them but your brothers. These are his parents and it\u2019s his wife and kids they are berating with their nonsense. He needs to sit them down and talk with them. If he can\u2019t do that then he\u2019s not a very good spouse. \n\nYour parents have a very \u201cfake it til you make it\u201d boomer mindset. It\u2019s really really hard to get through that and maybe you never will. Subtly stick up for your SIL when you see it happen in person but beyond that it\u2019s in your brothers hands.", "NTA.

She will need you during this pregnancy.  You don't mention her husband...what is his attitude about this? Is he making his parents understand the reality of the situation?", "NTA. As a second mom with their first pregnancy the circumstances here are different. It\u2019s her third child, the first biological from her body.  They need to recognize that", "Nta talk to your brother, where is he in this? Your parents aren\u2019t actually helping they are just being lazy. Their excuses don\u2019t hold water.

Being pregnant is hard and stressful especially when you are looking after other children. She needs support from everyone around her. I would talk to your brother and see if there is any other way you can help support you SIL and maybe see if you can have a chat with the kids and explain that what your parents are saying isn\u2019t true and you can understand how they feel. Blending families is hard and it sounds you SIL is doing a great job. I\u2019m sure it would be devastating for the kids if their grandparents ruined that for them. Once the kids get older they will appreciate everything your SIL has done for them and be grateful she stuck with it even when things were hard and they weren\u2019t always open to her being in their lives and that she hasn\u2019t tried to be a parent just another person who loves them", "NTA.
