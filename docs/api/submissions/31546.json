The problem is that she needs a sperm donor, but doesn't want to use one from a random stranger. So she asked if my husband would agree to her using his. He hesitated and finally said he would leave the final decision to me. I immediately said no. I do not feel comfortable with me or my husband being the biological parents of any child other than ours.

Is this a poly situation?\n\nYou can create a donor contract, making it clear your husband has no parental responsibility to any child resulting from this donation.", "NTA\n\nShe can find her own sperm", "NTA. Sperm and egg donation are personal choices, and her previous surrogacy (which, as someone pointed out, is kinda sus because most legitimate programs require surrogates to have given birth) has absolutely nothing to do with it.\n\nIf she wants to become a single mother, she can work with a sperm bank or a donor other than your husband.", "Wow this one is complicated.  I would be interested to know how much you paid her, I think that would sway my judgement (I don't actually expect you to tell me).  I mean, if she was very well compensated and it was more a financial transaction versus she did it for love of her sister and got expenses and a bit covered.  If it was the second then I can see why she would be hurt she gave 9 months of sacrifice for you so carrying your own child didn't interfere with your work.\n\nI will say NAH here I think based on the information provided", "\n\nBy cheating I mean Money scam! \n\nThat\u2019s clearer. \n\nBut seriously. This woman is the reason you have a child. Not because you are physically not able to, but because you didn\u2019t want to take time out from your job.  That\u2019s a huge ask. The bond you feel with a baby even as a surrogate must be hard to let go of. Did she even get compensated? \n\nI get that you feel she\u2019s not entitled to it being your husband\u2019s sperm, but you come off as sound a bit selfish given your reasons- you seem more concerned with money than your sister. \n\nESH. She shouldn\u2019t have asked for your husbands sperm, but it could just be that she\u2019s carried his child before and also knows that your child turned out well.

That's not to say you owe this specifically to her, but she has done something wonderful for you because she loves you and wanted you to have your family, and she's asking for the favour to be returned.
