She's been on about 7 dates with him over the last 2 months, and they've stayed the night/weekend at each others places before. \n\nI met him once and he seemed a decent guy, but I just can't be bothered to care about him. My flatmate and I are both professionals in pretty well-paid jobs and he is living in socially-supported housing with an ex-wife and three pre-teen kids. My flatmate and I are only living together for another 2 months because she is leaving her job to go travelling the world for 2 years (she has enough savings to do this and is very well-travelled already). I just can't see this relationship lasting - he is clearly tied down to an area and doesn't have the resources to join her.\n\nMy flatmate and I are friendly and will have evenings in together watching films etc. but we don't socialise outside the flat and I don't think we'll stay in touch once we part ways. Given she's not a close friend and given that I can't see this relationship as serious I just can't be bothered to get to know him.\n\nWell the other day I was off work mid-week (we both do shift work). I like my days off alone in the flat. Except he happened to be in the flat. My flatmate had mentioned he was staying the night, maybe two, but I hadn't clocked that she would be at work all day and he'd just be....in the flat. I was trying to catch up on a series on TV and he was making lunch and trying to chat. I already found it weird he was in my flat without her, and on my day off. So I just politely smiled and gave short answers and eventually he got the hint and went to her room and then shortly after left the flat until my flatmate returned home.\n\nMy flatmate says I'm TA for being rude and I kinda agree that I was but honestly I only have 2 months left in this flat and he is some randomer in my home on my day off. He's not my guest so I don't have to host him. If he wants to watch TV he can go to his own home.", "created_utc": 1687473945, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ghj7c/aita_for_coldshouldering_the_guy_my_flatmate_is/", "score": 124, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You shouldn't have unwanted guests in your home while your roommate isn't present. Like you said, you did the minimum of communication and he got the hint. He likely left because he realized he was an AH in that moment and needed to find something to do away from the flat while your roommate worked. Your roommate needed to communicate his presence more thoroughly beforehand. It needed prior approval. She was simply not fully considerate of the situation. For the record, I was in this exact same situation many years ago. I was the guy hanging out in my long-term girlfriend's apartment when her roommate came home. It completely freaked her out even though we'd all known each other for several years. I was just trying to get some computer work done; wasn't trying to hang out. I quickly read the room, apologized, and left. Things were weird for awhile after that.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to want to have time to yourself in your own flat and not entertain conversation with someone you didn\u2019t invite and don\u2019t care much for. Many flat shares have rules, such as, partners or hookups shouldn\u2019t be there unaccompanied.\n\nNonetheless, there is a lot of classism and condescension toward someone you clearly think of as less worthy of a human being compared to you and your \u201cprofessional\u201d flat mate that is a) gross on its own merits and b) totally irrelevant to your story, which makes me wonder why you felt compelled to list all the ways you look down on him. The description you gave says a lot more about you as a person than it does about him.", "NTA.  I don't actually think you were the least bit rude, if your behavior was really as you described here.\n\nPolite but terse answers in response to, basically, a stranger?  That's not rude.\n\nShe couldn't possibly have expected you to entertain him, not if she's sane.\n\nI think I'd have been appalled that she let him stay there without her, myself.  I'd have had words with her afterwards.  Although, maybe not if it's just for another two months.", "NTA.", "NTA.  You weren\u2019t mean or swearing. You just wanted to be left alone.   There\u2019s no reason for you to get to know him and alone time is precious.", "NTA- also love the word randomer. Yeah you're exactly right, if you were deliberately mean and unkind to him I'd say YTA, but you were short, polite and just weren't interested in conversation. That's honestly fair. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You might have a slightly snobbish mindset, as you\u2019ve mentioned, but this is nowhere near AH level, and being polite but reticent is fine. Protecting your alone time is also fine. Not being \u201cthe friendly kind\u201d doesn\u2019t make one an AH.\n\nThat said, it might be sometimes worthwhile, in many different ways, to make time for people you didn\u2019t think were worth your time and effort.", "NTA. You were not rude, you didn\u2019t ignore him but you didn\u2019t encourage him either. She has only been on 7 dates with him, how well can she know him? She should be uncomfortable leaving him alone in her home at that stage of the relationship, especially since she has a roommate and she didn\u2019t inform you he was going to be there without her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You didn't ignore him or demand that he leave; you just didn't invite him to hang out with you because you don't know him and just want to watch your show.  Not to mention, how rude is it to keep talking to someone when they're clearly paying attention to something else?  I remember trying to make small talk with my mom while she was reading or watching something and she'd react similarly (short answers, not looking up from what she was doing, and then finally putting down the book/looking away from the tv and giving me a LOOK when I didn't get the hint) because she just wanted some time to herself.\n\nIf he's going to be in the flat when she goes to work, she needs to talk to you about it first.  Even if you're not home when he's there you might not want someone who's essentially a stranger to have unrestricted access to your home and personal property.", "YTA\n\nYeah. The way you talk about him is clear that you're just being an asshole to someone beneath you. You were rude, and it's probably because you think you're better than him. I get not wanting to become besties with him since you'll only know him for maybe 2 more months, but you could be nice about it. Like, \"I'm sorry, but I'm trying to catch up on this series. Would you care to join me?\"", "YTA, and you know it too. Just own it, because the way you talk about people and relationships is very cut and dry AH behavior.", "NTA. I also think it\u2019s ok to be a little snobbish. You do you.", "I accept that. I agree I'm probably being snobbish, though I definitely don't think he's \"less worthy of a human\" than anyone else. I added the description of him to highlight how he and my flatmate are in vastly different places in life and have very different resources available (which may impact the things she wants to do and the life she wants to live, hence me not setting much in store by this relationship). I also can't describe him with any other characteristics because I met him once (now twice) and I really don't know him, other than these facts that my flatmate told me.\n\nBut yes, I acknowledge that I'm being a bit snobbish and I'll try not to let it affect how I treat him/their relationship. Though I've come to realise that's somewhat harder to do when a stranger I don't know is being left alone in my home.", "Why should I invite a stranger who is not my friend or really known to me at all to watch TV with me in my own home? And on my day off when I want to be alone?", "You\u2019re not really friends with your flat mate and this is a new guy she\u2019s seeing, so you\u2019re not super into being new best friends = totally fine. Not wanting someone you barely know hanging around your flat without your flat mate there, also fine, and plenty of AITA posts address this scenario. \n\nHe does not otherwise require a description. Yet you felt compelled to make judgments on him, their relationship, \u201cthe life she wants to lead\u201d etc ; you\u2019re looking for justifications for disliking him, and the ones you pick are snobbish. And this is where I am challenging you to have a think about why you have been so quick to make judgments about him based on these few scant facts, where no judgment or even opinion was required.\n\nIt\u2019s fine to not want a stranger in your home, so just say that to your flatmate and skip the rest.", "Then don't. I'm not saying that you have to invite him. You just didn't have to act like an asshole. I get wanting to be alone, but it's not just your flat. She informed you that he will be staying the night, maybe a couple of nights. This means that he might probably stay there while she is at work. Unless you all had an agreement that people would not stay there while the host was at work, she had a right to allow her boyfriend to wait for her there. In which case, you should have reminded her that he can't be there while she is not.", "NTA for not wanting to talk to him but YTA for being a snob. It's pretty obvious that you look down on him for not having as much money as you or your flatmate. You're judging him mainly by his economic status and that makes you a snob. And that's not a good thing.", "NTA.\n\nYou were polite. You do not have to be friends with this person. You're not an AH for not sacrificing *your* day off in *your* living room for some stranger's feelings. He could easily have entertained himself.\n\nETA: \"not\" before \"sacrificing\".", "NAH, your flatmate\u2019s guest is allowed to try to initiate small talk, you\u2019re allowed to not want to make small talk with your flatmate\u2019s guest.", "NTA.
